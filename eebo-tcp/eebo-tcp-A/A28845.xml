            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This my Brethren, is the Treatment which the Church ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves.

Band of Chriſtian Fraternity: But the greateſt part being prepoſſeſſed with the Blind hatred which their Miniſters had inſpired them with, made a Mock of us; and every one that calls to mind our Antient Unity, whereof they carry an Impreſſion in their Breaſt, through Baptiſm, are returned to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that is to ſay, to the Catholick Church, where God has eſtabliſhed his Name, and the Profeſſion of Chriſtianity for ever.</p>
            <p>Finally, the Grace of God hath abundantly manifeſted it ſelf in our Dayes. A King as Religious and as Victorious as <hi>Ezechias,</hi> has invited the Trangreſſors of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the Unity of <hi>Juda,</hi> that is to ſay, the Erroneous and the Schiſmaticks to return to the Peaceable and the Orthodox; and we have ſeen ſomething of that which is Written in the Holy Prophet <hi>Oſea: At that time the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi>

The ſame Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Chriſtianity, and as I have already ſaid, the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Baptiſm has ſecretly recall'd you thither: NOT ONE OF YOU HATH SUFFERED VIOLENCE, EITHER IN HIS PERSON OR GOODS. Let them not bring you theſe deceitful Letters which are addreſſed
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62475:4"/>
from Strangers transform'd into Paſtors, under the Title of Paſtoral Letters <hi>to the Proteſtants of</hi> France, <hi>who are fallen by the force of Torments.</hi> Theſe Letters concern you not, otherwiſe than as they are made by People, who could never prove their Miſſion: So far have you been from ſuffering Torments, that you have not ſo much as heard them mention'd. I hear other Biſhops affirm the ſame: But for you, my Brethren, I ſay nothing to you, but what you may ſpeak as well as I. You are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned Peaceably to us, you know it. When I Preach'd the Holy Word, the Holy Ghoſt made you perceive I was your Paſtor. I have ſeen you crowding about our Pulpit with the ſame earneſtneſs as the reſt of my Flock: The wholeſome Doctrine entred into your Hearts as you heard it Expounded clearly to you; and the Doubts which Cuſtome more than Reaſon had form'd in your Minds, yielded by little and little to the Truth. Nothing could hinder you from acknowledging that I was in the place of thoſe who planted the Goſpel in theſe Countries: You have reverenc'd them in my Perſon, though unworthy. I have not Preach'd to you any other Doctrine than that which I have receiv'd from my Holy Predeceſſors, as every one of them hath followed thoſe who went before them, ſo have I done the ſame. Look upon all the Biſhops, who round about you, and even through the whole extent of this Kingdom, We have all the ſame Glory which We will not ſuffer to be taken from us. In this Succeſſion a double Language has been never heard. The Biſhops that ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from our Unity, ſuch as are they of <hi>England, Suede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Denmark</hi> at the moment of their Separation, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly renounced the Doctrine of thoſe who had Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them. It is not ſo among us, united alwayes to the Chair of St <hi>Peter,</hi> where from the beginning of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity We have acknowledged the Band of Eccleſiaſtical Unity, We have never condemned our Predeceſſors, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62475:4"/>
we leave the Faith of the Churches ſuch as we found it. We can ſay without fear of being reprehended, that they Cannot ſhew any change in the Catholick Church, unleſs in thoſe matters of Ceremony and Diſcipline, which from the firſt Ages have been alwayes held for indifferent: As for thoſe inſenſible changes which they accuſe us to have introduc'd in Doctrine; in that they call them <hi>inſenſible,</hi> it is enough to convince you, that there are none marked out, and that they cannot ſhew an innovation by any one poſitive matter of Fact. But what they cannot ſhew us, we are ready to ſhew to all thoſe who have forſaken us: There has not been any Interruption of the Antient Doctrine in any patt of the Chriſtian World, but is known; the date of the Innovation and Seperation no Perſon is ignorant of. If there had been ſuch changes among us, the Authors would have been named; the Spirit of Truth, which is in the Church would have noted them, and their Names would have been infamous as that of <hi>Arius, Neſtorius, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagius, Dioſcorus</hi> and <hi>Berengarius.</hi> So that all they have told you of theſe inſenſible changes in Doctrine, of which they have not produc'd one example in the Chriſtian Church, is no other but an empty Accuſation without any matter of Fact-to ſupport it; and ſeeing you underſtand the Doctrine which I declare to you, and that which the other Catholick Biſhops alſo declare to you, you ought by no means to doubt, but that you hear in our Diſcourſe, thoſe who firſt preach'd the Goſpel, and in them the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and in the Apoſtles him who ſaid, <hi>Go, Teach and</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 28. 19, 20.</note> 
               <hi>Baptize, and behold I am with you even to the end of the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So when your Miniſters told you, You needed not trouble your ſelves about the Succeſſion of Chairs and Paſtors, provided you kept the Right Doctrine, and true Underſtanding of the Scripture; they ſeparated that which JESUS CHRIST hath been pleas'd to render inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62475:5"/>
And it is in vain they boaſted of underſtanding the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, when in the mean while they rejected the Means by which it hath pleas'd God to tranſmit it. It was his Will that it ſhould come to us from Paſtor to Paſtor, and from Hand to Hand, without the leaſt ſuſpicion or appearance of Innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. By this means we come to know what hath always been Believ'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and by conſequence what ought always to be Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd. It is, as I may ſay, in this <hi>(always)</hi> that the force of Truth and the Promiſe is evidenc'd: and the whole is loſt, if an Interruption be found but in one only Point.—<hi>Thoſe things which thou haſt heard from me (</hi> ſays<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 2.</note> St. <hi>Paul) before many witneſſes, commit thou to faithful men, who ſhall be fit to teach others alſo.</hi> To ſeperate the wholeſome Doctrine from this Chain of Succeſſion, is to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate the River from the Channel: And to vaunt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the Underſtanding of the Scripture, when they acknowledge they have loſt the Stream of Tradition in their Paſtors, is to vaunt of having preſerv'd the Waters after the Pipes are broken.</p>
            <p>Do not therefore hearken, My Well-beloved, to the<note place="margin">III. <hi>That the Author of the falſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoral Letter to thoſe who are fallen, imitates in vain the Language of St.</hi> Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian, <hi>whoſe Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns him a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Tongue, which theſe furious Men mean by <hi>Barbarous,</hi> but alſo in the <hi>French.</hi> Is it to ſay the <hi>Litanies</hi> to the Diſhonour of the Creator, to ſay at firſt, <hi>Lord have mercy upon us: Chriſt have mercy upon us: Chriſt hear us: Chriſt graciouſly hear us: God the Father Eternal, God the Son, Redeemer of the World; God the Holy Ghoſt, have mercy upon us: Holy Trinity, One God, have mercy upon us?</hi> Having laid this Foundation of our Hope, is it to ſpeak to the Honour of the Creature, and to the Diſhonour of the Creator, to ſay, <hi>Holy Mary, pray for us: Holy Mother of God, pray for us: Ye Holy Angels, pray for us:</hi> St. <hi>Peter pray for us:</hi> And the reſt? Do's not this manner of naming the Saints in the <hi>Litanies,</hi> viſibly place them rather in the number of thoſe that <hi>Pray,</hi> than of thoſe that are <hi>Pray'd to,</hi> as all our Doctors have taught?</p>
            <p>But how profitable ſoever their Prayers appear to us, our Devotions ſtop not there. We return preſently after to JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS CHRIST, whom we conjure by all his Myſteries, and by all the Names which he has taken to aſſure us of his Goodneſs, <hi>to deliver us from all Evils,</hi> of which the greateſt and moſt terrible is <hi>Death in Sin.</hi> We continue the <hi>Litany</hi> in praying God to bleſs all the Children of the Church, and to endue them with his Graces, of which a Pious Enumeration is made. Finally, we three times in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the <hi>Lamb who takes away the Sins of the World;</hi> and after an Admirable Pſalm, and many other Prayers ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs'd to God, the Prieſt offers up the Vows of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which he Prays him favourably to hear for the Love of his Son JESUS CHRIST our Lord. Behold theſe <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanies</hi> which we Sing to the Honour of the Creatures, and to the Diſhonour of the Creator! Is it thus then we eſtrange our ſelves from God?

After all, what
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62475:10"/>
have they to ſay to this Prayer, <hi>Pray for us?</hi> Is it not Word for Word St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s in many places? Is it more inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious<note place="margin">1 Theſſ. 5. 25.</note> to the Creator, becauſe in the ſame Spirit we addreſs to the Saints that live with him? Let us paſs over your captious Queſtion, Whether they hear us or no? A capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Queſtion I ſay, ſince it cannot be ſaid of the Holy Angels that they hear us not, thoſe of whom it is expreſly Written, That <hi>they preſent our Prayers to God.</hi> This Reaſon then do's<note place="margin">Rev. 8. 3, 4, 5.</note> not hinder, but that we may ſay to them, <hi>Ye Holy Angels, Pray for us;</hi> and at laſt we muſt come to this Cavil, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh the Beatified Souls from the Holy Angels, with whom they are united by the ſame Illuminations, the ſame Graces, and by an Eternal Society. But once more let us lay aſide this: To decide the Queſtion, if our <hi>Litanies</hi> are to the Diſhonour of the Creator, is it not enough that it is clearly reveal'd by God, that this Prayer, <hi>Pray to God for us,</hi> do's not take any thing away from God? Is not the thing evident of it ſelf? Do's it take off our Hearts from God? Where do we place our laſt End, where do we fix our Heart and our Confidence, when we ſay, <hi>Pray to God for us,</hi> if not in God? But by whom do we ask the Saints to Pray, if not by JESUS CHRIST? Is not this the Faith of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and of the whole Church, That the Saints themſelves are not heard, neither can obtain any thing for us, but by JESUS CHRIST? So far is the Prayer by which we deſire them to pray for us, from weakning our Confidence in God, and in our Saviour, that it entirely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſes it, as much as the like Invitation which we make to our Brethren who are on Earth.</p>
            <p>But then it ſeems our Images, and the Honour which we<note place="margin">VI. <hi>The ſame Author's Calumnies upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages.</hi>

I know it; and the Dryneſs of their Devotions reaches not to theſe tender and affectionate Actions, though they te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie and excite Devotion and interiour Fervour. But this, you will reply, is not Written. What an Error it is to deſire every thing ſhould be Written, even to the leaſt Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular? Is it not enough for the Perfection of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that the Fundamentals are Written; and the Church the Faithfull Interpreter of thoſe Fundamentals in Faith which the Scriptures contain, ought ſhe not alſo to be a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Guarantee for all the reſt? But, my Brethren, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſputing, I ask you; Is it Written any where, That it is good to Swear upon the Goſpel? Do they make difficulty of this in the New Reformation? And at the ſame time, is it by the Ink, or by the Paper, or by the Letters and Characters that they Swear? Is it not by the Eternal Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity which theſe things repreſent? How would you treat thoſe who were afraid to make this Oath, and how would you call this vain Scruple? Would not you declare it to be a Weakneſs, and a Superſtitious Fear? Now what is the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the Croſs, but another manner of Writing that which is Written in the Goſpel, and of which it is an Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That JESUS CHRIST is our Saviour by the Croſs? If this be not true, if it be not true that JESUS CHRIST hath Redeemed us by the Croſs, let them ceaſe, as an Holy Pope ſays, to Preach it, and to Write of it. But if it be truly a Myſtery of Faith and Piety, why do they not Write it all manner of ways that can be? And wherefore ſhould not this Scripture of Images be as Venerable, as that which is made upon Paper? Are not Paper and Letters the Work of Mans Hand, as well as Sculpture and Painting? But who do's not ſee, that in all theſe things
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62475:11"/>
we regard not what they are, but what they ſignifie? And that it is no leſs an Error, no leſs a Superſtition, to be afraid that the Honour which we give to an Image terminates in the Marble or the Metal, than 'tis to be afraid that it ſtops at the Paper and Ink, when we touch the Goſpel to Swear upon it?</p>
            <p>You will wonder your ſelves, my Brethren, I ſay it again to the <hi>weak,</hi> who yet retain the unhappy Relicks of their Antient Errors: I ſay, you will wonder to hear your ſelves tax'd of Superſtition, and you will anſwer certainly, it is not your Vice. But tell me in the mean time, what is the fear which hinders you from making your Prayer to JESUS CHRIST upon your Knees before his Image, as well as before a Pillar or a Wall? For in ſhort, you muſt be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes before ſomething; Why then do you not chooſe an Image of JESUS CHRIST as well as a White Wall? Is this Image become incompatible with our Devotions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it repreſents to us the dear Object of them? But I ſee, My Well-beloved, what 'tis you fear: You fear that your Genuflexion inſtead of Reaching to JESUS CHRIST will ſtop at the Wood, or the Ivory; as if this Genuflexion could of it ſelf paſs to any thing, without being directed by your Intention whether it ſhould tend? But do you not well know, that your Intention is to addreſs your Vows to JESUS CHRIST himſelf? Or fear you that JESUS CHRIST do's not know it? Or fear you that this Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the Body ſignifies to him ſome other thing then that which the whole Church, and your ſelves conforming to Her Intentions have a deſign it ſhould ſignifie? Acknowledge then once for all, that it is a groſs Ignorance, a pittiful Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and a true Superſtition, to fear that in effect you Honour the Wood, when you have an Intention to Honour JESUS CHRIST.</p>
            <p>But you fear, ſay you, that then you ſhall not take the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of the Decalogue ſufficiently according to the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62475:11"/>
Very well, Take it then intirely according to the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and tell me, that it is as unlawful to make Images, for it is Written, <hi>Thou ſhalt not make them,</hi> as it is to fall down<note place="margin">Exod. 20. 4. Ibid. 5.</note> before them, becauſe it is Written, <hi>Thou ſhalt not proſtrate thy ſelf before them.</hi> Underſtand then, my dear Brethren, that it is forbidden to make Images, and proſtrate our ſelves before them in the Spirit of <hi>Pagans,</hi> believing that they are filled with a Divine Vertue, or that the Divinity incorporates it ſelf with them, as the <hi>Pagans</hi> did believe; in one Word, with a deſign to ſerve them, to put our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence<note place="margin">Iſa. 44. 17.</note> in them as the <hi>Pagans,</hi> and with them to ſay, <hi>Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver me, ſpare me, for you are my God;</hi> for this was the true Character and Foundation of Idolatry, as <hi>Iſaias</hi> in this place, and the whole Scripture teaches us.</p>
            <p>And ſay not, That if the <hi>Pagans</hi> believ'd theſe things, they were intollerable ſtupid; for ſo indeed they were: and it is not in vain that this Holy Prophet ſays in the<note place="margin">Ibid. 18. 19.</note> Place juſt now cited, <hi>They know not, they underſtand not, they have no Eyes, they have neither ſence nor underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they make no reflection in their heart, they know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, they perceive nothing.</hi> Is this enough to make you ſee, that the groſneſs of Idolatry ineffect kept within no Bounds, and proceeded even to incorporate the Divinity, which they believ'd was Corporeal, with Matter? Now whereas in the courſe of time the Philoſophers bore above this Common Error of Mankind, it would be eaſie for me to ſhew you, that they always relaps'd into it in ſome kind, and in every Caſe, as the Apoſtle convinc'd them, they confirm'd the Impiety of the Publick Worſhip in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to it. But without entring into theſe Diſputes, and to keep our ſelves to the Scripture, you ſee what it<note place="margin">Cat. Dim, 23. Advert. to the Expoſ.</note> condemns when it forbids Images. The Catechiſm of the New Reformation agrees to it: It tells us, as I have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark'd elſewhere, and it is no pain to me to repeat it ſince it is neceſſary for you to underſtand it; this Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62475:12"/>
tells you, That <hi>the Images which God prohibits in the Decalogue, are thoſe where the Divinity is believ'd to be repreſented as if it were Corporeal, and are look'd upon as if God ſhew'd himſelf there to us.</hi> They cannot ſay that we have this Belief, without an inſupportable Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny. They allow, that concerning the Divine Nature and the Creation our Belief is moſt pure: With this Belief it is impoſſible that we ſhould be Idolaters. We ſerve not Images; but we ſerve our ſelves of Images, to render us more attentive to the Pious Objects which excite our Faith. When you ſay, That the People place their Confidence in them, you raſhly Judge your Brother: He is obedient to the Church, which ſo exactly diſtinguiſhes that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the Original, from that which belongs to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative; and ſince he ſubmits to Her Decrees, why will you not believe that he conforms his Intentions and Sentiments to Hers alſo? If you at any time fee a Taper lighted before the Image of a Saint, you will preſently believe that it is to ſerve the Image. You deceive your ſelves: This is to tell you, that this Saint is the <hi>Light of the World,</hi> and that you ought either to follow his Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, or imitate his Vertues. If at any time we burn In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe before Relicks, or, if you will, before any Image; 'tis as much as to ſay, that the Doctrine and the Examples of the Saints are a ſweet Odour of JESUS CHRIST, and that we ought, after their Example, to ſend forth a like Perfume before God, and in the Church. When you Judge other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, you Judge the <hi>Servant of another,</hi> contrary to the<note place="margin">Rom. 14. 4.</note> Precept of the Apoſtle. But you ſhall never perſwade ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a <hi>French man</hi> that his Vulgat Language can ſignifie any other thing than what Cuſtome hath allow'd; or the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Church, that the Language of Her Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies can have any other Signification than that which the Decrees and Uſage of the Church have affix'd to them. And tho' particular Perſons may not have Intentions pure
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62475:12"/>
enough, the weakneſs of one do's not prejudice the Faith of another: And tho there were an Abuſe in the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of theſe particular Perſons, is it not enough that the Church reprehends them? And ſuppoſe they were not ſufficiently reprehended, it is one thing to approve a thing, another to tolerate it: And ſuppoſe it were ill to tolerate this Abuſe, I would not break the Unity for this; and to ſeparate my ſelf from a thing which can do me no hurt, I would not plunge my ſelf into the Abyſs of Schiſm, where I ſhould periſh. St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> avouches, That he ſaw many Superſtitious Practices, which he could not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove; <hi>and yet that he durſt not always reprehend them</hi>

               <hi>with an intire liberty, leſt he might ſcandalize either pious Perſons, or hot and turbulent Zealots.</hi> He was not the leſs pure, becauſe there was Iniquity in theſe Practices. <hi>The Church,</hi> continues the ſame Father, <hi>in the midſt of the Chaff and the Tares that ſurround her, tolerates many things: but neither do's ſhe approve, nor do any thing contrary to Faith and good Manners.</hi> What the Church tolerates<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is not our Rule, but what ſhe approves: And thoſe who ſerve themſelves of ſuch like things to exaſperate you againſt us, and to hinder ſo great a Good as is that of a Re-union,<note place="margin">VII. <hi>Vnjuſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches touching Ceremonies, the Service in Latin, and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration of</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>in the</hi> Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt. <hi>That the Pretended Reform'd are groſs &amp; carnal, not we, as they accuſe us.</hi> Jam. 5. 14. 15.</note> are accurſed of God.</p>
            <p>As for what concerns the <hi>Pagan</hi> and <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Ceremonies, with which this fierce Letter ſays our worſhip is filled; where are they? Is it the Sign of the Croſs?

a crime? But perhaps you complain that the Prieſt appears at <hi>Maſs</hi> ſometimes with his Hands lifted up to Heaven, as the Apoſtle preſcrib'd, ſometimes with his Hands joyn'd, to<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 8.</note> teſtifie greater Ardour, when the matters require it, or that ſo often as he begins any New Action he turns towards the People to give them, and receive from them a <hi>Salutation</hi> in Sign of their Communion. Are the Miniſters offended at the Sacred Habits which their Brethren the Proteſtants of <hi>Germany,</hi> and their yet more dear Brethren the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants of <hi>England</hi> have retained as well as the greateſt part of the Ceremonies; And do they expect that theſe things which appear either profitable or indifferent in other Countries, ſhould ſtrike you with horrour, only when you ſee them practiſed by your fellow Subjects, and in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church?</p>
            <p>In effect, they aim at nothing elſe but to caſt Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom upon all that we do. I ſhall have other occaſions to inſtruct you concerning the Service in the Vulgar Tongue, and I have often done it already by word of Mouth. But what would this furious Miniſter mean by theſe words, <hi>Accuſtome not your ſelves to this Barbarous Language which robs the Peoples Ears of Religion, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leaves ſomething for the Eyes?</hi> Is not this a viſible Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny to aſperſe the Catholick Church, that ſhe would conceal from the People her Myſteries after the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> hath made<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this Decree: <hi>That least the Sheep</hi>

to you. The Books which they have put into your Hands explain all to you; and thoſe who perſuade you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that we would take from you the knowledge of the adorable ſecrets of Religon, aim at nothing elſe but to fill you with gall and bitterneſs againſt your Brethren.</p>
            <p>But behold the great grievance, We make you adore Bread. I have already profeſſed to you, that I will not enter into Controverſies; but I will only tell you, that this Reproach is like that which the <hi>Socinians</hi> caſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, and which heretofore the Diſciples of <hi>Paulus Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſatenus</hi> objected to us; they denying the Divinity of JESUS CHRIST, accuſe us of being Idolaters, and imagine they have a purer Worſhip than ours, becauſe they render not Supreame Honour to a Man. But whilſt they glory in being more Spiritual than we, and of paying to the Divinity a purer Adoration; they are in effect Carnal and Groſs, becauſe they follow nothing but their Sence and Humane Reaſon, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuades them that a Man cannot be a God. They would make you Spiritual after the ſame manner; they boaſt of purifying your Worſhip in obliging you to beleive, it is only Bread which you ſee upon the Holy Table, and that the Body of JESUS CHRIST, which you ſee not there, is not alſo there, neither can it be there. What do you alſo in this but follow Fleſh and Blood? But if after the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Catholics, you would raiſe up your minds, if you would render your ſelves capable of believing that JESUS CHRIST hath power to vail himſelf under the Figure of Bread to excerciſe our Faith; what could hinder you from underſtanding theſe words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> as lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally<note place="margin">Mat. 26. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Now that Men's Minds are more calm'd, and they have acknowledged in favour of the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> that this Manducation of the Fleſh of our Lord, which was look'd upon with ſuch deteſtation, has no poiſon in it; that it contains nothing either repugnant to Piety, or to the Honour of God, or to the good of Men; inſomuch as the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> who believe and practice it as well as we, are thought worthy to partake of the Holy Table, and to be true Members of JESUS CHRIST: What reaſon have you to ſtrain the Words of JESUS CHRIST and by force introduce a Figure of which not one Example is found in Scripture? But if we are Idolaters becauſe we adore JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS CHRIST in the Euchariſt: What are the <hi>Lutherans?</hi> It is not true, tho they tell you ſo, that they do not adore JESUS CHRIST in the Bleſſed Sacrament. If you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult them, they will tell you, that believing JESUS CHRIST to be there only when he is receiv'd, they adore him there only when they do receive him, and that 'tis to adore him in receiving him that they receive this Holy Sacrament on their Knees. But tho they did not render him any exteriour Adoration, who knows not that it is not in this Exteriour the Service do's conſiſt? The Acts of Faith, Hope, and Charity, addreſſed to JESUS CHRIST as preſent, is not this a perfect Adoration they render to him? And if it be an Idolatry to Adore JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS CHRIST in the Sacrament of the Supper, can he that Adors him there Interiourly exempt himſelf from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Idolater? How then can he have part at the Table of JESUS CHRIST, and in the Celeſtial Heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage?

It is a manifeſt Truth, both among us and the Miniſters, That the Church can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be where the Sacraments are not. If then both Kinds are abſolutely neceſſary to every particular Faithful, if the Sacrament do's not ſubſiſt but in the Diſtribution of them both; the Miniſters muſt ſay, That ſo long as but one Kind was given, the Church was without the Sacrament of the LORD'S SUPPER. Nevertheleſs, they dare not ſay this: They are forc'd to allow, that People were ſav'd amongſt us, at leaſt before their Reformation, and that the True Church was there. They are neceſſarily bound then to acknowledge, the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper was there alſo, and that by conſequence it ſubſiſts in its full perfection, being diſtributed but in one only Kind.</p>

It was under a Miniſtry then, that furniſh'd it with all neceſſary Food, without depriving them of any, even tho' they had ceaſed to give the Cup; and the Cup cannot then be reckon'd among thoſe Aliments neceſſary to a Spiritual Life.</p>
            <p>Come then, my dear Brethren, come to the Sacred Bancquet of the Church, and make not its Perfection to conſiſt in both the Kinds, ſince the Miniſters themſelves are forc'd to grant they give you under one Kind all the Aliment that is neceſſary to a Spiritual Life, without <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving you of any of it.</hi> In effect, what ground can you have to doubt? It is upon the Faith of the Church you content your ſelf with your Baptiſm, though you receiv'd it in your Infancy, without the Authority of Scripture, and after a manner, if the Letter only be regarded, ſo different from that which JESUS CHRIST ordained; that he himſelf obſerv'd the firſt; wherein alſo the Apoſtles have plac'd the Myſterious repreſentation of our Burial as well as of our Reſurrection with JESUS CHRIST.

            <p>Monſieur <hi>Claude</hi> oppoſes to us Experience; and to ſhew us, that this invincible force which we attribute to the Eccleſiaſtical Miniſtry in vertue of the Promiſes of <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST,</hi> do's not at all belong to it, he brings us many Paſſages of <hi>Heriveus,</hi> of St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> of <hi>Alvares Pelagius,</hi> and of others, who in the foregoing Ages deplored the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Clergy, and deſired a Reformation. I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take not here to Examine theſe Paſſages: You may read them; and if you find but only one where theſe Authors have complained of Tranſubſtantiation, or of the Sacrifice, or of the Adoration of the Euchariſt, or finally, of any of the points of Doctrine upon which <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> have grounded their Reformation, I will readily aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the cauſe. But if on the contrary, among ſo many Paſſages cull'd out as it were for Oſtentation, there be not to be found one that regards the leaſt of theſe things; acknowledge that theſe Pretended Reformers have<note place="margin">IX. <hi>The Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Paſtoral Letters againſt the Catholic Church, yea, and againſt the Primitive Church alſo.</hi>

            <p>Hearken then no more to their dangerous Diſcourſes. Call not any longer that horrid Schiſm which hath deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Chriſtianity, a Reformation; and turn againſt the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62475:25"/>
of Re-union, the abhorrence with which they would inſpire you againſt us. For is there any thing more worthy of Horrour than to make you hate the Church? Than to repreſent as <hi>Babylon</hi> her, who carries in her Forehead the name of <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST,</hi> and who puts her Confidence in him alone? Than to make her the Mother of Idolatries and Proſtitutions, who from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Chriſtianity even unto our days, hath not ceas'd to ſend her Children throughout the whole Earth, and even to the moſt unknown Regions, to cauſe the one only and True God the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt to be there Adored? It is not we then, My Brethren, who deſerve this juſt horrour which all of us have of Idolatry; 'tis thoſe who accuſe us falſely. Thoſe who bear falſe and ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Witneſs againſt an Innocent Perſon, are condemned to the ſame puniſhment which the crime of which they bear Witneſs did deſerve, had it been found true: So thoſe who accuſe us of Idolatry, whilſt we confeſs with ſo much Purity the name of God, deſerve before Men, that horrour which is due to Idolatry, and ſhall receive the juſt puniſhment thereof in the ſight of God.</p>
            <p>But above all, what horrour are they worthy of, who caſt this Accuſation upon the whole Church, and alſo on the Church of the firſt Ages? It is a long time, my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, ſince the Miniſters acknowledge, That during the Fourth Century the Church deſired the Prayers of Martyrs, and Honoured Reliques: And <hi>Vigilantius</hi> oppoſing himſelf to this Ancient and Univerſal Practice, was ſo ſmartly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by the Writings of St. <hi>Hieronymus,</hi> that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd ſingle and alone in his Opinion. If it be then an Idolatry to requeſt the Prayers of Saints, and to Honour their Relics, this Illuſtrious Fourth Age; yea, this Age wherein the Prophecies of the Kingdom of <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST</hi> were accompliſh'd more manifeſtly than ever, wherein the Kings of the Earth, till then Perſecutors of the

            <p>Can you endure, my Brethren, the Miniſters who by ſuch Reproaches diſhonour the Chriſtian Religion? This is not the only Outrage they commit againſt the Church; and without going further than this pretended Paſtoral Letter <hi>to thoſe who are fallen thro' Torments,</hi> you ſhall there find this Blaſphemy: <hi>Thus in the firſt Ages we ſee the Church fall into an Apoſtacy, like yours, after having taſted the charming Sweets of the Reign of</hi> Conſtantine <hi>the Great.</hi> Oh Prodigy unheard of among Chriſtians! The Holy Fathers reproach'd Heretics with Apoſtacy, in ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating themſelves from the Church: But that the Church her ſelf has apoſtatiz'd, he that hears it without horrour, is no Chriſtian; and you cannot look upon thoſe as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, who have uttered ſuch a Blaſphemy. But this Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy is inſeparable from the Pretended Reformation, To be able to ſay with any colour, that you muſt go out of the Church as out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> they muſt ſay, That the Church her ſelf had before apoſtatiz'd. If they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd her with leſs Crimes than Idolatry, they would not have been able to rout out of the Hearts of the Faithful the Veneration they had for her; and it was only by ſuch Exceſſes that a Breach could come.</p>
