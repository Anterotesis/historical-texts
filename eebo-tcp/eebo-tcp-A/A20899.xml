         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

that we can not diſtinguiſh the

of the <hi>agent</hi> which mooues the

further, that the <hi>Seruant</hi>
oweth all his actions (as a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant)
vnto his <hi>Maſter,</hi> and the
Maſter nothing vnto his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant;
and that therefore recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
any benefit from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
or Maſter, he is by far
more bound, than by ſeruing
he can oblige the other; ſince
in ſeruing he doth but the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of an inſtrument, the which
are to be acknowledged from
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:10501:14"/>
the <hi>agent,</hi> but in receiuing of a

I will reſerue, as for a place
more fit, in that part of <hi>actiue
Philoſophie,</hi> which conteineth
precepts of <hi>Oeconomicall</hi> pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
               <p>In the meane time wee ſay,
That not entreating heere of
<hi>naturall</hi> or <hi>violent ſeruitude,</hi> but
of <hi>voluntary</hi> and <hi>electiue ſeruice,</hi>
it ſeemeth, and not without
reaſon, it may pretend to haue
in ſome ſort the qualitie and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of a <hi>Societie,</hi> and that by
conſequence we may attribute
vnto it for the <hi>end</hi> thereof a
kinde of communion of <hi>good.</hi>
And certeinly that heerein the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:10501:14"/>
ſeruice due to the Maſter is
moſt conſiderable, may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
by what alreadie hath
beene ſayd, as alſo by weying
or iudging of their mutuall
bonds: for, if any demand
What is the ſeruants duetie or
bond, there is none I thinke
that will not anſwer, <hi>To ſerue
his lord and maſter:</hi> But on the
other ſide ſeeking what is the
Maſters dutie, we ſhall finde it,
<hi>To benefit the ſeruant according
to his merit.</hi> So that by this mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
obligation, theſe two
termes <hi>Maſter</hi> and <hi>Seruant</hi> are
vnited together in a ſocietie;
the which as hath already been
ſayd, hath for the <hi>end</hi> a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
profit. This granted, it
ſeemeth that the Maſters ſcope
or end is, the <hi>ſeruants</hi> benefit,
and that of the Seruant, the
<hi>Maſters ſeruice,</hi> ſince their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:10501:15"/>
haue theſe references. And
if it be ſo, there groweth a
doubt how it may be verified,
that <hi>euery one worketh for his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
profit,</hi> or that this is the
naturall inclination of euerie
man, and of all working things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
But it is anſwered, that the <hi>ends</hi>
are of two ſorts, either deſired
or intended by themſelues, or
by accident and cauſed by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Whereby it followeth,
that two, which between them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
ſeeme contrary, may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
one thing without repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy,
as in this preſent caſe it
happeneth. For the ſeruant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth
for himſelfe, and worketh
for his proper benefit, mooued
vnto it by a naturall inſtinct:
but by accident, and for this
cauſe deſireth and worketh in
the ſeruice of his Lord, ſince
that from hence finallie hee
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:10501:15"/>
draweth the profit and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity
which he longeth after;
whereby there is no contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
at all, that the ſeruant
ſhould haue for his end his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
benefit, and withall the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
of his Maſter.</p>
               <p>Yet this doth not wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue
the propounded doubt,
becauſe it ſeemeth, that if the
true and principall end of the
ſeruant be his owne proper
commoditie, we might ſay that
his dutie were to worke, not for
his Maſters ſeruice, but for his
owne profit: and therefore this
is by euery man with great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
reiected. Wherefore wee
ſay that a ſeruant may two
wayes be conſidered, either as
he is <hi>ſociable,</hi> or as he is <hi>aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:</hi>
if as ſociable, without
doubt the end of his actions is
his proper benefit: if as aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:10501:16"/>
by the bond of duty which
bindes him, his <hi>End</hi> is the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
of his Maſter. Or if in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
termes, we wil ſay the ſame
thing, that is, that the ſeruant
hath two <hi>Ends</hi> or <hi>Reſpects,</hi> one
which moueth him to contra<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>
this ſocietie, and this out of a<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>
queſtion and reſolutely is his
proper benefit; the other is the
end of the ſocietie, and this
doubtleſſe is the commoditie
or ſeruice of the maſter, though
not disbanded or diſioyned
from the profit of the ſeruant,
by the participation that this
habitude or reſpect of ſocietie
hath betweene the Maſter and
the ſeruant, the which, as it is
ſaid, endeth alwaies in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
profit.</p>
               <p>To conclude then, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue
that vnto another place,
which heere (as not ſo proper)
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:10501:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
we will but briefly touch. We
ſay, That the end for the which
the <hi>Courtier</hi> voluntarilie ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
his necke vnto the yoke of
ſeruitude, is his owne profit,
for the which as his end princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
intended, he both labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
and endureth much. But
his end, as a <hi>Courtier,</hi> obliged
in ſocietie and duetie of ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
is the ſeruice of his Lord,
the which he vſeth as a meanes
vnto the former and more prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall,
which is his proper be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit,
with the intercourſe of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
which followeth the actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
ſeruice. For the <hi>Courtier</hi>
firſt of all longeth after his
owne profit; but not able o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
to compaſſe the ſame
than by the loue and fauour of
his Prince, he propoundeth his
ſeruice, and diligently working
therein, obteineth his fauour,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:10501:17"/>
which breedeth his owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
and commoditie aboue all
other things by him deſired.</p>
               <p>It appeareth then that the
ends or ſcopes that the <hi>Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi>
hath are three, that is, his
<hi>proper intereſt,</hi> and this is that
which chiefly he endeuoureth:
next, the <hi>fauour of the Prince,</hi>
as the cauſe of his firſt end: and
then, <hi>the ſeruice of the Prince,</hi>
as the efficient cauſe of that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour.
But becauſe theſe things
haue in themſelues ſome diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
a larger declaration is
neceſſary.</p>

that it needs no other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication:

are not ſo well vnderſtood,
both the one &amp; the other terme
conteining many things, vnto
the which (it may be) the end
and dutie of a <hi>Courtier</hi> doth
not extend.</p>
               <p>Let vs firſt then conſider the
<hi>Seruice,</hi> and ſay thus; There is
no doubt, but the Prince hath
diuers and many ſorts of men
which ſerue him; as the ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
in the war, the Magiſtrates
in time of peace, and thoſe
which in his houſe perform his
neceſſary buſineſſe. If all then
(as it is moſt plaine) are bound
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:10501:18"/>
to ſerue him, all their <hi>ends</hi> ſhall
be the ſeruice of the Prince: and
ſo if he be a <hi>Courtier</hi> whoſe end
is the Princes ſeruice, all thoſe
aboue named, and particularly
ſuch which are in actuall ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
ſhould be <hi>Courtiers:</hi> but it
ſeemeth not only a new terme,
but withall, contrarie to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
ſenſe and the true ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the name of a <hi>Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi>
to comprehend therein, the
Souldiers, the Iudges and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Magiſtrates; wherfore we
can not ſay they are all <hi>Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi>
which ſerue, but only ſome
of them, amongſt whom wee
can not denie thoſe to be held
for ſuch which priuately ſerue
him. So as it is fit to conſider
in the Prince two perſons, one
<hi>publike,</hi> which makes him to be
a Prince; the other <hi>priuate,</hi> by
the which we ſuppoſe him to be
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:10501:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the head of a familie, as by the
other (as a Prince) hee is head
of a Kingdome or Common-wealth.
Thoſe then who ſerue
him as a Prince, that is, in the
actions belonging to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
benefit, were neuer called
by the name of <hi>Courtiers;</hi> but
thoſe only who ſerue him pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatly,
and are comprehended
in his familie or <hi>Court.</hi> From
this principle, wee draw that
which at the firſt we ſought for,
that is, what things this ſeruice
conteineth; for that, from it
are wholly excluded all ciuill
ends and publike actions; on
the other part are receiued all
thoſe which the domeſtical bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe
or that of the family re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth,
in ſuch ſort, that as the
Magiſtrate, in another place,
ſhall be by vs termed the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
inſtrument as a publike per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:10501:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſo is the <hi>Courtier</hi> his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument,
as the head and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of a familie; ſo that all
works belonging to the charge
of houſholdrie are embraced
and conteined in his end as a
<hi>Courtier:</hi> and therefore when
we ſay his end to be the ſeruice
of the Prince, it is vnderſtood
(as wee haue ſayd) of all that
which exceeds not the limits of
houſhold affaires.</p>
               <p>Let vs now come to declare
what is vnderſtood by <hi>proper
interest.</hi> It can not be doubted
that this terme <hi>intereſt</hi> doth not
conteine all kinde of humane
good, though to this large
ſcope of ſignification, it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the common vſe thereof
hath extended it, but we ought
with reaſon to aduert the exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of that good which cannot
be obtained from another: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:10501:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in vain ſhould the <hi>Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi>
ſerue the Prince to that end,
to obteine from him that thing,
which neither he nor any other
could impart vnto him: as for
example are the <hi>vertues,</hi> which
in vaine are expected from any
other, than from our owne well
ordered and proper nature: ſo
that this good excluded, it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
(and in this likewiſe the
vulgar opinion doth agree) that
for two things principally hee
doth take vpon him and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go
this ſeruitude; for <hi>profit</hi> and
for <hi>honour.</hi> Some ſerue for <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,</hi>
not eſteeming of <hi>honour,</hi> as
the mercenaries; others for <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi>
only, as the <hi>noble,</hi> either
by birth or greatneſſe of minde
and ſpirit; others both for the
one and the other.</p>
               <p>Well, let it be ſo that euery
man ſerueth for theſe two ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:10501:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ioyntly or ſeuerally. <hi>Profit</hi>
particularly includeth in it ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
the which are in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of neceſſaries for our life;
as money, lands, cattell, moue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables,
furniture for houſes, and
ſuch like. But by <hi>honour,</hi> is not
vnderſtood at all that which
followeth the actions or vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
qualities, ſince that this
good (as alreadie hath beene
ſayd) dependeth on our proper
election and facultie, and may
without others helpe be obtei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
for I thinke none of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that freely to vſe <hi>prudence,
fortitude, iuſtice</hi> or <hi>magnanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,</hi>
it is neceſſary to enter into
the Court of Princes; but there
rather to obteine degrees of
<hi>power</hi> and <hi>dignitie,</hi> which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
are called <hi>honours;</hi> or be
it that worthily by meanes of
vertuous actions they are attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:10501:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as honor giuen in reward
of vertue; or becauſe, as they
ſay, <hi>Honour is the opinion held of
anothers vertue:</hi> by meanes
whereof they obtaine in the
world an opinion of merit, or
becauſe he that poſſeſſeth it, is
honoured. So that the <hi>honours</hi>
which are the <hi>Courtiers</hi> end,
are degrees, dignities, power,
wealth &amp; the reputation, which
ſpring from them; and not the
whole compaſſe of <hi>honour.</hi> For
ſince the actions of vertue may

or beleeued: the which
happening by reaſon of the
Princes diſcharge or caſting off,
can not bee for the moſt part
without a great ſtaine or blot
vnto the <hi>Courtier.</hi> Wherefore
it is very neceſſary to be carefull
that this election ſhould bee
wiſely made, and it ſhalbe ſuch,
when the Prince which is cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
may giue cauſe vnto the
<hi>Courtier</hi> of that <hi>end,</hi> which prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
he pretendeth aboue all

iudgement heerein, wee muſt
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:10501:22"/>
conſider the qualitie of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
end, and the ability and
proportion which the Prince
beareth to the ſame.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Courtiers end</hi> hath alre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
beene ſaid to be his <hi>propt

<hi>honour.</hi> And becauſe there is
no limitation in deſired ends,
which are (as they ſay) infinite,
whereupon the Merchant co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueteth
an infinite gaine, and the

but in this affaire it hath
ſo little part, that without error
it may be let paſſe. Wee muſt
then examine his <hi>ability</hi> and his

                  <hi>willingnes,</hi> diligently beholding
what proportion they holde
with the forſaid <hi>ends,</hi> and if we
know them to haue proportion
vpon an effectiue cauſe, moſt
aſſuredly it ſhall bee good to
make choice of ſuch a Prince:
and to ſpeake more plainly, I
ſay, that if propounding any
profit, there ſhall be any Prince
that both can and will impart
the ſame vnto the <hi>Courtier,</hi> he
is the moſt worthie whom hee
ſhould ſerue. In like ſort may

the effects: for if the Prince be

and ſeemeth inclined thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:10501:23"/>
we may ſuppoſe an habit of

is aſſuredly incaple of honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
ſeruice. But in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
we muſt conſider a diuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
becauſe ſome Princes are
not of a beneficent and liberall
nature towards their ſeruants;
others are, but much more with
their ſeruants, to whom by me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of their ſeruice they thinke
themſelues in ſome ſort bound.
The illiberall niggardly and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
not beneficiall, are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie
of life, ſince they liue
vnprofitably in this humane ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie,
wherein nothing is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
more neceſſarilie, than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficence
and liberalitie; ſuch
Princes towards their ſeruants
are not woorthily enabled for
the ſeruice of the <hi>Courtier</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
in this arte; wherefore
for the moſt part they are ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:10501:24"/>
with mercenarie people
without ſpirit or feeling of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and to conclude, worthy
of them.</p>
               <p>Amongſt thoſe who are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiall
towards their ſeruants,
there are ſome, who ſparingly
and with hardneſſe grant their
benefits and fauours, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they doe not loue the
good of their ſeruants, but
doubting leſt hauing profited
them, they ſhould abuſe their
fauors, or ſuſpecting leſt ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themſelues too gentle, they
ſhould grow too confident and

contract ſeruice,
but how he is to proceed to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine
theſe fauours ſhall be fully

this aduertiſement is ſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
that taking any other courſe,
all hope of euer being fortunate
in Court is cut off: wherefore
he muſt not only make profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
in words, but with effects
make perfect ſhew to haue no
other intereſt than the abſolute
ſeruice of his lord: which to do
we will now teach the meanes.</p>
               <p>The ſcope of the <hi>Courtier</hi> is
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:10501:26"/>
his <hi>proper interest,</hi> that of the

the actions which the <hi>Courtier</hi>
can performe, ſome reſpect on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
his proper intereſt, ſome the
ſeruice and commoditie of the
Prince, and ſome are common
to both. Of thoſe reſpecting
the proper intereſt, ſome are
contrary to the Princes ſeruice,
ſome not: likewiſe, of thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting

ſome are repugnant and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie

others not. Now, ſeeking in
what maner by meanes of our

with an apparent will of the

neceſſary that we who wholly
abſtaine from thoſe actions
which behold our proper com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie
to the preiudice of the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:10501:27"/>
Prince. It is alſo neceſſarie (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it ſhould not be ſo great
an error to do the contrarie) to
beware to doe any thing which
immediatly reſpecteth our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
good. And of all this the
reaſon is cleere enough by what
hath beene ſayd before.</p>
               <p>Thoſe actions now which are
common to the <hi>end,</hi> both of the
one &amp; the other, are not great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hurtfull nor profitable to the
<hi>Courtiers</hi> intention: but thoſe
actions are profitable which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
the Princes commoditie,
and eſpecially thoſe which ſeem
to conteine any danger or da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
to the ſeruant. Amongſt
thoſe of greateſt importance to
maske the appetite of our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
commoditie, are thoſe
which are wrought in benefit of
the Prince with great danger
and detriment of things moſt
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:10501:27"/>
deere. But we muſt note heere,
that the <hi>end</hi> of the <hi>Courtier</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
double, that is, of <hi>profit</hi> and
<hi>reputation;</hi> in that of honor or
reputation we muſt haue ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
conſideration and regard,
becauſe it ſhalbe an action moſt
commendable in a Courtier (as
a <hi>Courtier</hi>) to deſpiſe or refuſe
ſome honour or dignitie to
continue in the ſeruice of his
Prince; and in this ſort to ſuffer
a damage, is a thing to be deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
but withall it ſhould not be
commendable, if for any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of his Lord he ſhould ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
any blot or ſtaine in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation:
for that is a thing
which amongſt men ought to
be preferred (as commonly it
is) yea before life it ſelfe. But
in that which belongeth to the
profit and good ſeruice of the
Prince, he may ſecurely make
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:10501:28"/>
any loſſe, the which by how
much either in aduenture or in
effect it ſhall be greater, by ſo
much the more doth it anſwer
to courtly wiſdome. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

I meane the goods which may
be giuen or taken, and in deed
all are termed actions of this

Common-wealth, that is, of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
done vnto his countrey,
which deſert is recompenſed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to diſtributiue iuſtice,
whoſe rule is (as in the <hi>morals</hi> it
is taught) <hi>Geometricall proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi>
but to ſpeake more fitly to
the common capacitie, we ſay,
that the <hi>axiom</hi> or ground being
true, <hi>That moſt is due to him that
ſerueth moſt, and leſſe to the leſſe
ſeruing, and nothing at all to him
who actually is not in ſeruice;</hi> it
followeth, that they are greatly
deceiued, who thinke with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie
only, with abundance of
wealth, ſingularitie in learning,
armes, or ſuch like, to merit
more than thoſe vnto whom in
reſpect of ſeruice, they are farre
inferiors; becauſe the reward of
the Court (as hath beene ſayd)
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:10501:31"/>
muſt be proportioned as from
the efficient cauſe from whence
it groweth, vnto the actuall ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice.
For as if you were to make
choice of a Captaine to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
ſome dangerous enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe,
their pretention ſhould
be very vaine, that would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
themſelues, either for
their beauty of body, learning,
wealth or nobilitie, to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
in choice, before the
more experienced and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in matters of warre, though
leſſe learned, and inferior vnto
them in other qualities: the
like opinion is held of thoſe
who in Court pretend greater
deſert, for ſuch like reſpects,
whileſt others in diligence of
ſeruice go farre beyond them,
becauſe Courtly deſert is not
brought into the Court, but is
neceſſarilie to bee ſought for
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:10501:32"/>
there, and is by labour obtei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
which labour properly of
the <hi>Courtier</hi> is to ſerue. I ſay
not now, that a learned Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
is not of qualitie greater and
more eſtimable than an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
and a noble man than a
plebean, although in ſeruice;
but I ſay, theſe are qualities,
which not put in practiſe or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed
in the Princes ſeruice,
reape no reward with him, they
cauſe indeed a precedencie of
one man before another, as
members of a ciuill ſocietie, but
not as Courtiers. So likewiſe,
if (for example) we conſider of
one nobly borne in compariſon
of a vulgar perſon, it is moſt
cleere he is of greater eſtimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as a man and part of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie;
but if wee peize and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
them as ſouldiers, wherin,
it may be, the ignoble is more
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:10501:32"/>
practiſed and better diſpoſed
(ſuppoſing at leaſt it bee ſo)
without all doubt hee ſhall be
preferred, and the noble man
pretending the contrary ſhould
take a vaine and vndue excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>But heere we muſt not let
paſse a difficulty, occaſioned by
common obſeruance, and iuſtly
commended of all: that is, let
vs ſuppoſe two in the Princes
houſhold, whereof one far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celles
in nobility, learning and
other like qualities, but little
imploied in ſeruice; the other
much inferiour vnto this: It is
thought fit by all, that the more
noble &amp; qualified ſhould more
honourably bee entertained:
wherfore we ſee him ſometimes
honored by the Prince at his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
receiueth greater commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities,
of lodgings, of ſeruants,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:10501:33"/>
precedency in place, in title, in
ſtanding couered and in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement;
in fine, the Princes
reſpect of him in eſtimation is
very conueniently more then
of the other, whereupon wee
may doubt, how this may be an
effect of Courtlie iuſtice, or
how the foundation of deſert
ſhould be ſeruice. Whereunto
we anſwer thus; he who is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
in the Princes houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde
may two waies be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
either as ſuch a man with
ſuch conditions and qualities,
or as a Courtier only. If only
as a Courtier, I ſay it ſhalbe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtice
to him who ſerueth more
to be leſſe rewarded, or but in
equall liberality with him, who
in actuall ſeruice was his inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.
If as ſuch a man and ſo
qualified, it is very reaſonable,
that who excelleth in good
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:10501:33"/>
parts eſteemed of in common
<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ociety, ſhould be had in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
accompt and reputation.
But there reſteth a doubt if we
ſhal preferre one conſideration
before an other, and that when,
and in what things: for that we
ſee many times the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of one as qualified to bee
preferred before the other, as a
Courtier, &amp; therefore although
he ſerue leſſe, is not withſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in better place. We ſee
alſo on the other ſide, that the
beſt qualified in ſome things
ſtand farre inferiour, to the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and diligent ſeruing <hi>Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier.</hi>
For, ſpeaking of fauours
(for the moſt part) the beſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued
obtaine them, and thoſe
are, the diligent carefull in ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice,
they haue greater autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
with the Miniſters of the
Court, and of the houſholde
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:10501:34"/>
affaires of the Prince, yea and of
the publike alſo, reſpecting the
power of a <hi>Courtier-fauorite,</hi> &amp;
the recompence with profit and
dignity, preſuppoſing their abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
which ordinarily &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
compare is more large to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
them. And ſurely the
name of <hi>Minion,</hi> or <hi>Priuado,</hi>
which we ſee commonly attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
to thoſe greatly fauoured
in the Court, is not obtained by
the beſt learned, by the greateſt
captains, the moſt noble, or the
happieſt in fortunes bleſſings;
but by thoſe who in their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
ſeruice are moſt readie. So
we ſee <hi>Seianus</hi> preferred in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
with <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and with
greater liberality rewarded then
any other that ſerued at that
time; albeit we may ſafely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue,
there were many, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other things that did ſurpaſſe
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:10501:34"/>
him. And alſo thoſe <hi>Pallanti-Narciſi,</hi>
and <hi>Caliſti</hi> with <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi>
and <hi>Tigillinus</hi> about <hi>Nero,</hi>
were not ſo farre in authority
and fauour aboue others, as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
an infinite number of thoſe
times, they were without all
compariſon moſt inferior in all
other good qualities.</p>
               <p>Wherefore we ſay that the
benefits which the Prince doth,
are of two ſorts, one which he
beſtoweth amongſt his ſeruants
anſwerable to their qualities, as
men in that kind enabled; theſe
benefits are apparent and doe
not grow vpon any Courtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert
of thoſe on whom they are
beſtowed, but vpon the loue
and fauour of the giuer; which
is plaine, becauſe they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
in the beginning of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice,
when we cannot ſay there
was any deſert before, &amp; might
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:10501:35"/>
aſwell haue beene granted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
any ſeruice, and it may be
greater. The other kind of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit,
is that which is giuen to
thoſe, who with great diligence
haue ſerued; and theſe are not
granted but after ſeruice begun,
and are augmented as the fauor
by ſeruice doth encreaſe, which
makes vs attaine ſometimes to
that pitch of grace that <hi>Seianus</hi>
did,<note place="margin">Ann. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>qui varijs artibus Tiberium

moſt earneſtly intreating they
might haue the fauour to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold

and in ſcorne of wonder obtei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in marriage the widowe,

Neither, it may be, is it of leſſe

be deere to them or in fauour,

take notice of them: neither
doth he ſay that it was neceſſary
or profitable, but, <hi>pro magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co

conclude that the office and

fruitfull and firme, to

binde all thoſe that are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended

and act ſome thing woorthy
thereof, in ſuch ſort, that euery
aſſociate, (as ſuch an one) is
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:10501:38"/>
bound to endeuour himſelfe to
that end whereunto the ſociety
tendeth: and that this is true,
there is no <hi>Society</hi> found with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>Bond,</hi> nor <hi>Bond</hi> without <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,</hi>
either reall or rationall,
that is, with tearmes and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
really and apparent, or
at leaſt diſtinct in works of the
minde and vnderſtanding, as
more plainly we will ſet downe
in the <hi>actiue Philoſophie,</hi> which
is the proper place. Wherefore
the bond or duty, is not other
thing then the habitude reſpect
or cuſtome which the aſſociats
haue together, which is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſiue
beginning to labour for
their common good, as their
only end. The labour or work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
which doth grow heereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is called the office or duty
of the aſſociats, the which duty
in fine, is no other thing then an
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:10501:38"/>
actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſpringing from that bond,
although this word, bond, is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
alſo vnto the action, ſo
that in ſaying he doth his duty,
bond or office, it hath all one
ſignification. Now it is cleere
that this duty hath a proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with the <hi>End,</hi> becauſe that is
the cauſe of the working, and
therefore from it, it receiueth
the rule, order and moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which ought to bee ſuch
as the end propoſed requireth.
Wherefore he doth his duty
who worketh proportionably
to the end ſet downe, and hee
who doth actions preiudiciall
to ſuch end, doth the contrary.
But he doth more then his duty
who doth things comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the end and more: and he
leſſe, who doth things that in
their owne nature, are not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable
to the deſtinated <hi>End,</hi>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:10501:39"/>
or leaueth many things vndon,
which to the obtaining of the
purpoſed end are very neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
Whereupon, both duty
and bond, as hath beene ſaid,
being all one, euery aſſociate is
bound to labour and indeuor
for the end intended by the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
wherein he is, and who
doth leſſe, anſwereth not his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and who doth more, is ſaid
to exceede in duty and is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable,
ſo it doth not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice
the ſociety in any ſort:
who doth any action not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the <hi>End,</hi> worketh
idly and in vaine, but who doth
things hurtfull to the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
end doth things contrary
to his duty and bond. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we conclude, that by the
purpoſed end of euery <hi>Society,</hi>
is drawen and knowen what
actions euery of the aſſociats
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:10501:39"/>
are bound to performe, and
from which to abſtaine, adding
thus much for a greater decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
of the actions which
may be performed in a ſociety,
ſome are commanded and fall
vnder the bond which in that
fellowſhip bindeth the aſſociats
therof, and theſe are the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
actions for the obtaining
the deſired end, others are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
and doe diſcredit the
actours thereof, and thoſe are
preiudiciall or contrary to that
end: In both, the bond of
duty hath power, but in thoſe
which are neceſſary it bindeth
to the performance, &amp; in thoſe
which are contrary to the abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence.</p>
               <p>Let vs come now to our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
purpoſe: it hath beene
already ſayd, there is a kinde of
<hi>ſocietie</hi> betweene the <hi>Prince</hi> and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:10501:40"/>
the <hi>Courtier;</hi> the which for the
inequalitie of termes, hath not
altogether the <hi>common benefit</hi>
for <hi>end:</hi> yet if not that alone, at
leaſt principally that of the
Maſter, wherefore the <hi>Courtier</hi>
is bound to doe all that which
doth comprehend the benefit,
profit or ſeruice of his Lord.
And becauſe aboue wee haue
ſufficientlie declared that the
ſeruice which is the end of this
ſociety is reſtrained to the houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
or <hi>oeconomicall</hi> part, in ſort,
that all the houſholde actions
which may redound to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of the Prince, fall vnder
the bond of the <hi>Courtier,</hi> that
is, binde him to effect the ſame
for the ſeruice of his Lord: and
on the contrary, all that may
preiudice this <hi>oeconomicall</hi> ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice,
is forbidden the <hi>Courtier,</hi>
and doing it, doth a thing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:10501:40"/>
his name; and by that
reaſon may be called an infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
ſeruant, ſince that as do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
well, to the deſired <hi>end</hi> of
the ſocietie, he obteineth ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
thereby: ſo who worketh
to the contrary is defamed; yet
not ſimply or wholly, but an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable
to the ſocietie and his
bond of duty. As for example,
hee ſhould be a very infamous
ſouldier, who at the giuing bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
ſhould throw away his armes
and flie, but not wholly diſgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
becauſe hee might then
iuſtly be ſo called, as if he had
betrayed his Prince and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
or ſuch like: for the reaſon
which ſhalbe ſhewed elſwhere:
ſo likewiſe he is a diſhonorable
<hi>Courtier</hi> who acteth any thing
contrary to the <hi>oeconomicall</hi> ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
of his Prince, but not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether

from the firſt, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
make a ſurceaſing of the
motions which ſucceed: the
which is true, not alone in the
cauſes of naturall motion, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the which the ſuperior
taken away, the inferiour can
worke or moue nothing at all.
As doubtleſſe the elements
ſhould be idle, if the heauen the
ſuperior cauſe were not, neither
would the heauen moue, if the
internall parts aſſiſted not, nor
ſhould that haue force of moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
if from the ſuperiour, and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:10501:43"/>
finally from the firſt mouer, by
tradition from one vnto the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
there were not vertue im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted.
But ſo likewiſe it falleth
out in deſignes and purpoſed
<hi>Ends;</hi> amongſt the which that
is the firſt &amp; chiefeſt, which by
influence (as it were) doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
the vertue of mouing the
deſire to all the reſt, and doth
make it happy, as hath beene
ſaid, and by degrees doth much
more qualifie the next adia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
<hi>Ends,</hi> in ſuch ſort, that it is
impoſſible for an inferiour to
moue any affection without the
vertue of the ſuperiours pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe:
but much more to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to mooue the deſire towards
himſelfe, with a preiudice of
that good, which doth exceede
it. By example it will be made
more plain. There is no doubt,
but the ſickeman for his health
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:10501:43"/>
ſake longeth for a medicine:
and therefore I ſay, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
he ſhould wiſh for it,
or in any ſort conſent to the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
thereof imagining it hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to his health, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
is, becauſe the leſſer or infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
purpoſe or <hi>end,</hi> doth not
moue but by vertue of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and more eminent, and
therefore when no vertue doth
flow from this, that other by no
meanes can be deſired, neither
then doth it impart any vertue
at all, when the inferiour pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
or end doth preiudice or
hurt the ſuperior, as hath beene
ſaid of the potion hurtfull to
the health.</p>
               <p>Now let vs come to our own
caſe, and giue ſolution of the
propounded difficultie, which
moſt eaſily will be done: I ſay
that the <hi>Courtier</hi> can not deſire
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:10501:44"/>
in the ſeruice of his Prince, any
thing that ſhall be hurtfull or
contrarie to his owne profit and
commoditie; the reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he deſireth not the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
ſeruice, as thereby mooued
vnto it. But by reaſon of his
owne profit which giuing ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
and efficacie to that ſeruice,
to mooue the Courtiers deſire
and appetite, doth not ſuffer
for the reaſons before noted,
that he deſire it to his preiudice.
Wherefore all that is contrarie
to the Courtiers profit, mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that profit, which (as a Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier)
is the end hee aimeth at;
hath without queſtion no place
in his deſires, whileſt he deſireth
to ſerue the Prince: all which is
occaſioned by the dependancie
of <hi>Ends,</hi> amongſt which, his
owne profit is chiefeſt and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior;
the Princes ſeruice, the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:10501:44"/>
leſſer and inferior, whereupon
of neceſſitie that muſt be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
becauſe howbeit this <hi>Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie</hi>
be not fully a ſocietie, for
the diſparity of termes, ſo alſo is
there not aſſigned for the ſcope
thereof a benefit and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie
equally common. Yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
ſince in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting
thereof, the election of
the Prince interpoſeth it ſelfe
aſwell as that of the Courtier,
it ſhould in ſome ſort make
common the benefit thereof.
For if you bound it within this
terme, that the ſcope thereof be
the Princes ſeruice, but yet ſo,
as ioined in a ſort to the Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
benefit, becauſe it is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
impoſſible to worke for
an other, not hauing an intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for ſome proper benefit.
And this being knowne (as is
ſaid) by the Prince, he contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:10501:45"/>
the ſocietie with a band on
his part alſo, that is, to benefit
the ſeruant (as heereafter ſhall
be declared) and is contented
the Courtier ſerue him, intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his owne profit: wherefore
the Prince deſiring, that either
without this, or contrary to this
<hi>intereſt,</hi> the Courtier ſhould
ſerue, requireth a thing contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
to all right: neither is the
Courtier in any ſort bound to
ſerue him. And more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
to come to the propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
difficultie, I ſay, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Prince can looke for it,
nor the Courtier is bound to
ſpend his life for his Lord, the
reaſon why, is, becauſe the
life is farre more deere, then all
that he can either hope for, or
deſire in ſeruice. Whereupon as
he ſhould be held for one vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduiſed,
who for a leſſer good,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:10501:45"/>
ſhould chuſe the loſſe of a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
benefit, ſo ſhould that
<hi>Courtier</hi> haue little diſcretion,
who for the obtaining of the
purpoſe of his ſeruice, which
conſiſteth in profit, dignity and
power, would aduenture the
hazard &amp; loſſe of his life, which
by many degrees is more deere
vnto him, then al theſe benefits;
yea ſuch as without the which
the reſt cannot be obteined: and
if wereſolue thus touching the
life, much more ought we vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
the ſame in caſe of <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi>
and <hi>reputation,</hi> according to
the Ciuill opinion, which is far
more precious then the life in
the higheſt degree. Concerning
<hi>Goods,</hi> the reſolution is not ſo
eaſie, ſince thoſe who propound
vnto themſelues, the increaſe
or winning of profit, it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie
they conſider what they
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:10501:46"/>
loſe and what they hope to get,
becauſe it may bee aunſwered
in this ſort: That it is fit to
ſpend leſſe of a mans abilitie in
his Maſters ſeruice, then that
which he is in hope to get by
the ſame: neither is it ment the
<hi>Mercenary Courtier</hi> is bound to
impoueriſh himſelfe, and ſuffer
detriment in his wealth, fully
and competently to ſerue his
Lord. But who ſo preferreth
dignities, honor and power, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
of much greater eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
then riches, may ſecure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for the obteining of them
ſpend of his owne, as voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
not of dutie, if the contract
either expreſly or couertly
binde him not thereunto. The
which point of contracts is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
conſiderable, amongſt the
which are the vſe and cuſtome
of the Courts, the which more
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:10501:46"/>
or leſſe tie the Courtiers to like
expences. As if the Prince in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Court vſe to keepe table for
his ſeruants, the Courtier know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ſame, and bound to ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice,
is to ſerue at his owne
charge; which in other Courts
he were not, where the cuſtome
is the Courtiers ſhall be found
their diet. But of like matters,
as things of ſmall note, there
needs no longer diſcourſe.</p>

dutie</hi> vnto the Prince; to the
end he may know what to hope
for by his ſeruice, and how farre
to ſtretch the limits of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,
becauſe hereof it may
follow, that hee will neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcreetly
make offer of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice,
not knowing to what end
he ſhal labour, nor happely ſhal

with all poſſible care to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooued,
ſince iars and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
doe ſtop the paſſage to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour,
and for the moſt part
breed diſguſts and pikes of ill
ſatisfaction &amp; diffidence both
on the one ſide and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
But becauſe theſe things
ſhall be more largely treated of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:10501:47"/>
elſewhere, we will onely heere
reſtraine our reaſons to breui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and point at that which to
our preſent matter ſeemeth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie.
Wee ſaie then that
though the ſociety of the Prince
with the <hi>Courtier</hi> (as before is
noted) be not a perfect ſociety
whereby the end thereof is not
as in others, wholly the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
benefit, there is no doubt
notwithſtanding, but the Prince
hath likewiſe on his part a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
bond, by vertue whereof
he is tied not alone to deſire,
but withall to looke out and
performe, ſome thing which
may be beneficiall and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
for his ſeruant. And this
is that which at this time wee
purpoſe to manifeſt, that is, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
what kinde of benefit, and
vnto what termes he is bound:
becauſe as the <hi>Courtier</hi> (by what
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:10501:48"/>
hath beene ſaid) is not bound to
ſerue him, but in ſome things,
and in thoſe alſo by certaine li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits;
it ſeemeth very reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that withall, neither the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the <hi>Prince</hi> ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to euery benefit, whereof
the <hi>Courtier</hi> is capable, but vnto
ſome onely, and in thoſe, vnto
ſome determinate end, ſo that
the one bond may be anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
vnto the other, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
them, there may be a
due and iuſt proportion, that it
may not ſeeme, this <hi>Societie</hi> is
raſhly or inconſiderately made.
There is no doubt then, but
moderating this dutie by the
<hi>End,</hi> ſuch ſhould the action be,
as the firſt purpoſe requireth,
and ſince we haue ſaid the finall
end or ſcope of the <hi>Courtier</hi> to
be his <hi>Proper intereſt,</hi> it is moſt
cleere, that as hee is bound to
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:10501:48"/>
worke or indeuour to bring to
paſſe that <hi>End,</hi> which mooued
the <hi>Prince</hi> to conclude ſocietie
with him, which is his <hi>Proper
ſeruice:</hi> in like ſort the Prince is
bound to worke for perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of that end which moued
the <hi>Courtier</hi> to linke himſelfe in
bonds of ſeruitude with him.
So as wee may ſay, that the
Prince is bound to worke for
the benefit of the Courtier, in
thoſe things that the Courtier
propoundeth to obteine by ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice,
and thoſe are <hi>Profit</hi> and
<hi>Honour.</hi> But the greateſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie
reſteth, that is, how farre
foorth, or in what meaſure And
truly, if we conſider that in caſes
of <hi>Societie,</hi> no man performeth
his dutie if hee giue not ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to his companion, which
if he doe, it will be iudged that
hee hath performed the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctatation,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:10501:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>
this ſatisfaction then
riſeth from the proportionate
working to that end which his
aſſociate deſireth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Endes,</hi> as hath beene ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
are in themſelues infinite,
that is, deſired without meaſure:
ſo as the Courtier deſireth not
an indifferent profit, or a meane
degree or dignitie, but the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
that may be obteined. I
ſpeake not indefinitely, but as
from that Prince, becauſe hee
muſt not in his deſires extend
himſelfe further then the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
abilitie doth ſerue, that rule
being well knowne, that no man
is bound to an impoſſibilitie: it
ſhould bee an inſatiable deſire,
which ſhould ſo farre carry any
man to requeſt more of his lord
then hee can doe, or grant or
procure by his authoritie. It
ſeemeth then hitherto, that the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:10501:49"/>
Prince is bound to offer al thoſe
honors and profits vnto his
Courtier, which immediately
or mediately he can grant. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
we muſt note, that
as the Courtier himſelfe, is not
bound to doe all that he can in
ſeruice of his Prince, when the
performance thereof ſhall bee
preiudiciall to his proper inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt:
ſo much leſſe is the Prince
bound to benefit the Courtier
in ſuch things as are damagea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
or offenſiue to his ſeruice, &amp;
ſo much the more, by any acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
preiudiciall to more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
and deſired benefits of his
owne profits: hence may bee
gathered, whether he be bound
to benefit the Courtier in things
which bring diſhonor or ſpecial
detriment to his owne affaires
or fortunes, danger to his life,
diſage to his perſon, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:10501:50"/>
to his minde: by theſe
principles alſo may be exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
if hee bee to benefit that
Courtier, who of neceſſitie is to
abandon his ſeruice, and many
other commendable thinges
woorthie the knowledge of the
curious. But becauſe to proceed
further heerein were to exceed
thoſe termes wherein a metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicall

Of two ſorts of ſeruices con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable.</head>
               <p>FOraſmuch as I ſuppoſe we
haue ſufficiently diſcourſed
of the purpoſed ſcope or end of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:10501:50"/>
the <hi>Courtier,</hi> and of his duty in
generall: aſwell the order of the
treaty as their profit to whom
we intend it, requireth, that
we draw vnto the particulars ſo
much as we may, to confirme
and eſtabliſh precepts &amp; rules
for the more prouident procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
therein. You ſhall vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
therefore; that there are
two kind of ſeruice which may
be done vnto the Prince, the
firſt is due and anſwereth to
the particular charge or office
which is held in court, either of
<hi>Steward, Treaſurer, Auditor, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary,</hi>
or ſuch like. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
is not otherwiſe contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in duty, but offereth it ſelfe
of a free-will and election be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
all duty, and the reaſon
heereof is, that the fauour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
anſwerable to the ſeruice
that is done: who deſireth
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:10501:51"/>
greater fauour, then that deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
by this particular ſeruice
and proper charge which hee
holdeth in the Court, muſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
enlarge himſelfe in ſeruice,
and by that meanes merit a
greater portion of fauour, by
prefiguring vnto himſelfe an
obiect which in the amplitude
thereof may be anſwerable to
the whole co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſe of the ſeruice
hee may doe to the Prince, but
ſo, that the parts reſpectiuely
and in proportion correſpond
vnto the parts of his ſeruice, in
ſuch ſort, that to the office of
Secretary, of Auditor, and the
like, there be allotted ſuch mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of fauor, ſo reſtrained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
his limits, that it partake not
with that of an other office.
Wherefore it is neceſſary for
the <hi>Courtier</hi> who hath in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to be abſolutely poſſeſſed
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:10501:51"/>
of al fauor not to content him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
within the termes of his
particular ſeruice, but wiſely to
endeuour the extention of his
confines in a more ample ſort.
Yet with this condition, not
raſhly to diſcouer himſelfe an
vſurper or intruder vpon other
mens offices or charges, bicauſe
this would breede hatred a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mongſt
the <hi>Courtiers,</hi> and a
conceipt of preſumption with
the Prince. And therefore muſt
rather chooſe to deale with
thoſe which priuatly belong
not to any one, but are indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
to all, and may therefore
be exerciſed by any Courtier
without the preiudice or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure
of any one. This kind
in what it conſiſteth ſhall be
declared in his place, in the
meane time we will call it, <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:10501:52"/>
ſeruice,</hi> as the firſt <hi>ſeruice
of duty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But there ariſeth heere a
doubt, which is this, if he may
not haue the whole fauour, who
taketh not vpon him the whole
ſeruice, which cannot be done
without the offence of others,
and it may be the little ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the Prince: it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
then that it is impoſſible
euer to be full poſſeſſor of the
entire fauour. Whereunto it is
anſwered, that to intrude into
an other mans charge, not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
&amp; without authority, doth
breed bad effects as hath beene
noted before; but either called
or prouoked thereunto by the
Prince, or put in truſt therewith
through confidence obteined
with him, then he both may
and muſt doe it, where you ſhall
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:10501:52"/>
vnderſtand that the order to
obtaine ſuch fauour, is thus: by
ſeruing diligently to the Princes
liking in his ſpeciall or appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
office, that part of grace or
credit is thereby obteined cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent
thereunto, offering
of himſelfe in voluntary ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
that doe encreaſe credit and
fauour, from which encreaſe,
occaſion is offered (as more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly
ſhall be ſet downe) to
inſinuate himſelfe into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines
of other mens offices: ſo
that by well ſeruing, fauour is
augmented, &amp; by this increaſe
groweth occaſion to poſſes the
entire ſeruice; whereunto after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
is anſwerable, the abſolute
embracement of the Princes
loue and fauour; for the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
wherof the Courtier chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
laboreth as the only cauſe of
his felicity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:10501:53"/>
Yet heere riſeth a greater
queſtion, becauſe it is very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
to be vaine and ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to encreaſe diuers eſſences
&amp; things without ſpeciall neede
or neceſſity: though it be not
without cauſe, the inſtitution
of many officers in a Court,
ſince one alone cannot ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
ſatisfie the Princes affairs:
and if then it be ſo, he laboreth
in vaine, whoſoeuer hopeth (as
hath beene ſaid) alone to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
the whole ſeruice, and
by conſequence, it ſhall be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
loſt, to aſpire the winning
of the whole fauour. To this it
is eaſily anſwered, ſhewing firſt
by example, that in the greateſt
adminiſtrations, one alone may
ſuſtaine the charge of all the
ſeruice of a great Prince: as hath
beene done by the antient <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi>
and <hi>Proconſuls:</hi> who were
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:10501:53"/>
ſent into diuers Prouinces: and
by the <hi>Viceroies</hi> and gouernors
who are at this day deſtinated
to the greateſt charges, and
who doubtleſſe vndertake the
whole ſeruice of the Prince in
thoſe gouernments, for that in
him, that is in his authority, the
whole multitude of inferiour
officers are vnited. Wherefore
I ſay, that one effectually or in
act of execution is not capable
of all the offices in the whole
Court; ſome of them being ſo
nice and troubleſome, that they
require a whole man, free from
all other care: but in effect he
may containe them all, being
able by his authority to inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,
ordaine, diſtribut, mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
and moue all; ſo that the
whole domeſticall buſineſſe of
the Prince may be perfectly ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied:
for that how be it this
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:10501:54"/>
ſeemeth the office of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
and not of any ſeruant, we
ſee notwithſtanding for the
moſt part, affaires to be ſo little
pleaſing vnto Princes, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
of houſholde matters, that
they had rather leaue the whole
charge, to the wiſedome and
fidelity of ſome one thought
worthy thereof; in which ſort it
is not impoſſible that it ſhould
bee vndertaken by one alone.
Yet it reſteth that we diſcourſe
more particularly of the two
kinds of ſeruices propounded,
and firſt of ſeruice due.</p>

to his ſeruice, or any part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
wherein he ſhall be emploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that hee grow fruitfull and
fertile in his Princes fauour, euen
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:10501:55"/>
to the laſt and higheſt degree:
for thoſe in courſe are moſt
commendable, who by their
dexteritie and Courtly valour
come neereſt to this marke. To
doe the ſame then, it ſeemeth
very requiſit to begin (as it hath
beene ſaid) from the woorthie
and due performance of his
proper charge and place, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
we may not heere giue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts.
Becauſe if the Courtier
be to be Maſter of the horſe, let
him haue recourſe to <hi>Caualle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizzi</hi>
and ſuch as teach to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
them; if an Auditour, to
thoſe skilful in accounts, &amp; ſuch
like: the which as euery man
may ſee are not within the terms
of this Arte. But howſoeuer,
let him endeuour to be skilfull
in his owne office, for thereby
he ſhall obteine that fauour and
grace correſpondent thereunto;
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:10501:55"/>
it being a thing not queſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that an excellent <hi>Diuine,</hi> a
<hi>Secretary,</hi> or <hi>Auditour,</hi> manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
themſelues by their works,
ſhould prouoke and allure the
loue and fauour of the Prince,
by ſo much the more, as they
are more rare and excellent.
True it is that here we muſt call
to minde that which before in
another place hath beene ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
that is, that the fauour of
the Court is not gotten by the
opinion of vertue, but by the
vſe and exerciſe thereof to the
Princes profit. Whereupon none
of them that will deſerue well,
muſt content himſelfe to bee
ſingular and perfect in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
alone, but how with
greateſt perfection and rarity in
ſeruice to giue ſatisfaction and
pleaſure to his Prince. This
chiefly conſiſteth in manifeſting
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:10501:56"/>
an exact diligence with a deſire
to ſpare no paines fully to giue
him ſatisfaction: for as benefits
ioyned with loue and kinde de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations
infinitly encreaſe
reſpect and duetie, ſo likewiſe
ſeruice done with an earneſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
and a kind of partialitie
towards the Prince, worketh
maruellous effects; this being
moſt certeine, that manie petie
ſeruices, and almoſt vnworthie
conſideration, only accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
with an affectiue ſhew,
haue beene the beginnings of
ſpeciall rewards and incredible
fauours: and to ſay truth, there
is no ſuch price or meanes to
compaſſe or win loue, as loue it
ſelfe. But heerin we muſt ſtand
well aduiſed to ſhunne a moſt
dangerous rocke, that is, <hi>curious
and open affectation,</hi> which may
breed an opinion in the Prince
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:10501:56"/>
of want of iudgement, in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
whats conuenient, or els
that which is more perillous, a
doubt or ſupect of diſſimulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and by conſequence an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of hatred or ſcorne, not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
with the Prince, but with
the Courtiers alſo, who take no
pleaſure that any man ſhould
be ouer-diligent, or in appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
too-too paſſionate in the
Princes ſeruice. Next, not to
giue matter of ieſt by beeing
ſeene beyond all termes of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtie
or decorum to become
like an inamoured louer in the
ſeruice of his Lord. This affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
which is an exceſſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth
in nothing elſe than in
making the ſhew before named
with greater ardencie and more
earneſtlie than is fit, either in
the action, which requireth no
ſuch diligent affect, or at leaſt,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:10501:57"/>
not of him that doth it, but of
perſons more inwardlie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioint,
and of the Princes confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents:
or in reſpect of the place
and time, as where the Maſters
eye is preſent, or els ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
as neceſſarily or in all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood
will giue him notice of
the ſame, it ſhould be coniectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that therefore he doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in ſhew thereof, the which
by ſo much the more growes
odious, by how much it is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered
to be done for his own
profit and commodity: and the
more ridiculous, being knowen
the effect of a weak iudgement,
to obſerue <hi>decorum</hi> in himſelfe,
or in his actions, place or time,
&amp; other circumſtances, al which
proceed from a plebean and a
ſeruile mind. But on the other
ſide, it ſeemeth ſuch demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
and ſhew is done with
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:10501:57"/>
reaſon and conueniency, when
in the execution of that which
to our proper charge belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
we do ſo much as is thought
fit and neceſſarie, and beſides
that, perceiuing in the Prince a
deſire that the action be reitera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
or that a greater diligence
be vſed therein, we endeuour
fully to ſatisfie him, ſhewing to
do the ſame, not only without
any grudge or murmuring, but
with a willingnes and pleaſure,
though it may be inwardly it be
grieuous and diſpleaſing, and
therefore we muſt not attend til
by command the Prince diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
his deſire, but diuing (as it
were) into his minde, make an
incounter with his pleaſure,
preuenting the diſcouery; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Prince by nature ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtlie
deſiring his proper ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice,
which conſiſting in the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:10501:58"/>
Courtiers diligence, of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
taketh pleaſure to ſee him,
not liberall alone, but prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall
(if we may ſay ſo) in an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
curioſity and deſire to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
himſelfe, for his abſolute
and compleat ſatisfaction. And
in this ſort wee muſt thinke,
the <hi>Courtier</hi> exactly doth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
his duty in his particular
charge, from whence there is
hope offered him, when time
ſhall ſerue, to propagate and
enlarge his confines, within the
which his office is reſtrained,
it being verie likelie, that the
Prince being ſatisfied of his abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
and readineſſe in his priuat
office, will giue a paſſage and
entrance vnto greater affaires,
which ſhall be the fruit to haue
performed his dutie, as was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſit,

then which of due belongs

that he doe alſo ſome thing
more, then that which of right
apperteines to him, wherefore
hee muſt not onely endeuour
himſelfe diligently to ſatisfie
his owne charge or place, but
to imploy himſelfe withall in
ſome other things, whereby the
Prince may make coniecture of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:10501:59"/>
the <hi>Courtiers</hi> loue, and inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
will to doe him ſeruice. Yet
true it is, that heerein wee muſt
be very circumſpect, becauſe to
inſinuate or thruſt himſelfe into
other mens charges without or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
from the Prince, ſhould be
a raſhneſſe and preſumption;
wherefore hee ſhall note that
there are certeine endeuors to
this purpoſe very fit, as thoſe
which not onely are not hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
but very acceptable.</p>
               <p>Chiefly this <hi>aſſiſtance</hi> ſeemeth
to be in places, where the being
is both honorable and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
to the Prince, and theſe
are in the forechamber or that
of the <hi>Preſence,</hi> where manie
ſtrangers meeting, either by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of buſineſſe, or other
complement, it cannot but be
very gratefull vnto the Prince,
to ſee it well frequented with his
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:10501:59"/>
ſeruants, creatures &amp; fauorites,
by whom they are receaued, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored,
enterteined, and in the
end brought before him. In like
ſort when he feedeth, it cannot
but be pleaſing vnto him to bee
incircled with manie atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants;
As alſo in his viſitations,
or if hee chance to goe abroad,
to haue many about him, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly
will be very acceptable,
aſwell for their readineſſe vpon
any occaſion that may be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred,
as by the honorable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
which he receaueth, not
ſo much by the multitude,
which is a ſign of magnificence,
as by their diligent ſeruice,
which argueth a liberal and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiall
minde in him; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Courtier muſt not
thinke it tedious or time loſt to
be preſent vpon ſuch occaſions,
the which thing will make ſo
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:10501:60"/>
much the greater impreſſion, if
ſuch be his office, as by vertue
thereof he may well be excuſed,
becauſe by how much leſſe hee
is bound thereunto, the greater
note is taken of his affection.
This then is the benefit which
is gotten by this attendance or
aſſiſtance, which in ſumme, is
the Princes ſatisfaction, but the
fruit which it bringeth with it,
is of much more importance by
the occaſions which are offered
of infinite conſequence in this
arte: for that by this attendance,
in place where he is often ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
to the eie of the Prince, he
winneth euery day a greater fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliaritie,
and accuſtoming his
ſight to the obiect of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
the Courtier doth ſtil keepe
himſelf in a freſh remembrance:
beſides all this, manie times
there falleth out occaſion of
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:10501:60"/>
buſineſſe in ſome matters, the
execution wherof either in their
own nature, or for want of time
or other cauſe, is not commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to thoſe to whom in Court
it doth properly belong; but to
ſuch whom chance or choice
made preſent; and although
this belong not to their office,
as hath beene ſaid, yet yeelding
ſatisfaction, by the dexterous
performance thereof, it mooue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in the Prince a thought and
will, choicely or by name to
command him at an other time,
and in the end to poſſeſſe him
wholy with that charge. I leaue
to ſpeak of the accidents which
may fall out, by one whereof, or
very few of them, the entire fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
may bee obteined. It is
moſt cleere, that <hi>Seianus</hi> by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſleights made conqueſt of
<hi>Tiberius</hi> loue: yet that accident
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:10501:61"/>
of falling of the <hi>grott</hi> or caue,
whoſe ruins he held vp, defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the life of his Prince, with
perill of his owne, did ſo farre
aduance his fauour, that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
euen at his pleaſure they
might diſpoſe of him. But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the reſt of al theſe, there
are two moſt important bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits,
by this diligent aſſiſtance
or preſence, the one is the
knowledge of the nature &amp; hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
of the Prince: the other is
occaſions, which often fall out,
to haue diſcourſe or talke with
him. The knowledge of the
nature, cuſtomes, affections &amp;
humour of the Prince, is moſt
neceſſary, for imitation and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodating
your ſelfe vnto
him. The occaſion of diſcourſe
or talke with him, is of no leſſe
infinite conſideration and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit;
whereof it being ſo, that we

ſhall ſpeake heereafter; we will
in the meane time ſaie ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of the meanes how to
know the humor of the Prince,
and of fitting your ſelfe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto;
and after we will treat of
reaſoning and diſcourſe with

of the ſubiect wherein
they are to worke: we may alſo
ſay it is great reaſon, that the
Courtier being by his labour
and induſtrie to induce and
gently wreſt into the Princes
minde a loue and liking of him,
ſhould by ſo much as is poſſible
haue a full and perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of him, to the end that
by this foreknowledge, he may
order, rule, and moderate al his
actions: ſince it is out of queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that there is not one maner
of proceeding with all men: for
we may by ſome way obteine
the fauour of one, which would
procure the hatred of another:
wherefore if the nature of euery
one lay open and were mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt,
ſo that eaſily it might bee
learned and perceiued, it were
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:10501:62"/>
an idle thing to giue precepts
to obſerue it, or to obteine the
knowledge therof. But becauſe,
than it, there is nothing more
cloſe or ſecret to him that hath
not prying eies alwaies open aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well

not bee ſuperfluous briefly to
diſcourſe of this matter.</p>
               <p>We ſay then that diuers are
the meanes wherby the natures
of men are knowen, amongſt

<hi>Galen</hi> on their ſide is of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

And vnto him the whole Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

conſent, that the temperature
and compoſition of the body
being knowen, it is moſt eaſie
to geſſe what are the affects,

rule, to conſider the age

whether noble or ignoble, rich

meane fortune, and ſuch like,
vnto which conditions he doth
attribute their particular affects
and manners, ſo that knowing
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:10501:63"/>
in which of them any man is
found, preſently are his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
knowen: we may beſides
ioine vnto theſe the education
and profeſſion, apt alſo to qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie
and giue a habit to their
ſubiects. Likewiſe in the books
by me ſet foorth of <hi>Eloquence</hi>
it is declared, that from the
phraſe of ſpeech and meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phors
that are vſed, the nature
of him that formeth them may
be perceiued, and this alſo to
haue beene the opinion of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
ſages, whereof as I ſuppoſe

               <p>But becauſe theſe &amp; ſuch like

vpon Generals, &amp; to the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier
by reaſon of the place he

true meanes to attaine to the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:10501:64"/>
knowledge of the Princes na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and cuſtome is by his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
and yet not all, but thoſe
of choice, becauſe theſe diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
the inclination, as by the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
the cauſe is knowen; and
although diſſimulation, at firſt
ſight putting on a colourable
habit, and occaſion of the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
either different or contrary
to the naturall propenſion and
inclinement, it is yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
impoſſible to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale
or hide the ſame, from a
circumſpect and wiſe Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
for that if watchfully he ſhall
obſerue actions, it will eaſily
appeare whether he worke na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
and by a contracted ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit,
or elſe diſſemblingly; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
nature being euer the
ſame, and habits being gotten
by cuſtome, the actions muſt
needes be vniforme and alike
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:10501:64"/>
within themſelues. But diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation
wherewith nature is
not inueſted, but ouer-ſhadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
cannot be of that force, but
that ſome beame or raie of the
true and naturall inclination at
one time or other will pierce
and paſſe the ſame, and this is
ſo true, that as yet there hath
neuer beene ſeene, nor is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
euer to ſee ſo excellent a
diſſembler, who hath not beene
diſcouered and vnmasked by
him who familiarly ſhall deale
with him and carefully conſider
his actions by due comparing
them together. Becauſe the
arte of diſſembling groweth of
a forced and contrary habit vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
nature, it cannot be, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times of his proper force
withdrawing it ſelf from vnder
ſo heauy a yoake it will worke
actions quite contrary to thoſe
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:10501:65"/>
of diſſimulation. True it is that
the cunning diſſembler is caute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
and wary, and therefore
doth not diſrobe himſelfe of
his habit, but either by violence
or confidence: by <hi>Violence,</hi> I
meane forced by ſome mighty
hand to ſay or worke the truth,
a thing which cannot fall out
betweene the Prince and the
Courtier. But there is an other
kinde of violence, very profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and to be conſidered, that
is, an exceſſe of the affections
ſtirred vp or moued: the cauſe
is, <hi>reaſon</hi> being ſometimes trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
induceth forgetfulneſſe of
that caution, openeth the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
of the heart, and diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
that, which diſſimulation
kept moſt ſecret, beſides the
promptnes or difficulty it ſelfe
of falling into theſe exceſſes lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
open what is the true natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:10501:65"/>
habit, becauſe from hence it
groweth that he is more or leſſe
prone or apt to perturbations
vpon ſuch like motions. But
the conſideration of <hi>Confidence</hi>
is of moſt ſpeciall importance,
the which particularly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth
in <hi>places</hi> and <hi>perſons,</hi> and
in the perſons is conſidered the
beneuolence wherewith they
are made firme, or the opinion
of their incapacity to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
and penetrate, as alſo to
make manifeſt that which they
know in the <hi>places,</hi> for that the
chiefeſt end of diſſimulation
being to maske or ſhadow na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
inſtinct, when the places
giue aſſurance, promiſing ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
by their remoteneſſe from
the knowledge of men they do
eaſily entice the diſſembler to
giue the raines &amp; liberty to the
force of nature; and by the ſame
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:10501:66"/>
reaſon, to diſcouer himſelfe to
muddy perſons of little vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
and leſſe accuſtomed
to their caution: or rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
naturall actions, are done
with more eaſe &amp; pleaſure, they
put off, or at leaſt eaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
of that habit of diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation:
they doe this and much
more with perſons of whoſe
loue they are very confident,
and therfore it is reported that

conſider in what ſort hee is to
conforme himſelfe thereunto
in his ſeruice; wherefore we ſay,
that the nature of the Prince, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is plaine and open, and as
they ſay, <hi>abſque fuco, &amp; fallacia,</hi>
or it is encombred and ſhadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with a skreene of diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
If it be open, the rule is
eaſie therein to be obſerued, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
to what he is ſeene to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:10501:67"/>
to the ſame without all
queſtion is the Courtier to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and conforme himſelfe,
profeſſing armes if the Prince
be of nature martiall; learning
&amp; letters, if he delight in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
in holineſſe and religion,
if he be deuout; neat and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
in apparell, entertainments
and all other things, if he vrge
this; diligent and quicke in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution,
if he in his actions be
exquiſite and by nature ſpeedy.
To conclude, he is to adapt and
fit himſelfe by all the meanes
he may vnto his will, and make
himſelfe, if it bee poſſible, the
very portract of his properties
and faſhions. Becauſe ſelfe <hi>loue</hi>
which is the roote of all other
loues, chiefly extends it ſelfe
vnto his like, and more towards
thoſe who conforme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
in maners and naturall
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:10501:68"/>
inclination thereunto. Beſides,
if he make ſhew of imitation not
by proneneſſe of nature, but by
wil &amp; of choice purpoſe, this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
is very pleaſing, &amp; is as an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
of his actions, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and choice; a thing of all
men deſired: or at leaſt as in
tearmes of obedience and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
               <p>It is by oddes a thing more
difficult to fit himſelfe to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled
humors: becauſe fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
himſelfe to that which
fainedly the Prince profeſſeth,
it is moſt cleare that ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
doth not light vpon his
naturall inclination, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
doth not ſearch vnto the
quicke, but reſteth vpon a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficiall
affectation: On the
other ſide, if he will make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of the Princes faſhions
with a cloſe diſſimulation, it
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:10501:68"/>
cannot bee pleaſing vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
without his own preiudice,
knowing that no man praiſeth
or commendeth that in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which he doth truly hate
in himſelfe (I ſpeake in matter
of cariage or behauiour) and
ſurely hee ſhould feed himſelfe
with a vaine hope, that ſhould
thinke to be pleaſing by intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance,
to him that maketh
ſhew to be deuoted vnto conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency:
or by a deſire of reuenge
to him, who either openly or
couertly declares himſelfe eaſie
to forget all iniuries. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
the Prince diſſembling,
cannot openly bee delighted
with any one, that ſhall make
ſhew to haue a habit in that,
which colourably he is faine to
couer, without manifeſting the
truth of his inward meaning,
and making the falſe appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:10501:69"/>
to be knowne. But on the
contrary, he doth not truly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
himſelfe vnto the Prince
who doth not wholly fit himſelf
to his true and naturall inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Wherefore in theſe diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
it ſeemes the indifferent
way is not to diſcouer himſelfe
openly or by a profeſſed habit
to be contrary to the diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Prince; (for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple)
ſhewing himſelfe inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
with one that profeſſeth
temperance. For that this might
in reaſon ſeeme a deſpiſing of
him, and to haue in ſlight e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme
the diſguſt or diſpleaſure
which he by theſe actions and
contrary courſes might giue to
the Princes open and apparent
diſpoſition: or elſe might breed
ſuſpect of his knowledge of the
diſguiſe or counterfeiting; a
thing, which queſtionles might
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:10501:69"/>
win him hatred. But the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier
muſt ſhew himſelfe to bee
naturally inclined thereunto, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
in reaſon hee repugne
the ſame, and be ſame to force
himſelfe thereunto: becauſe
that which is truly naturall vnto
the Prince, ſhall ſo much the
more be iudged a naturall incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
in him, though masked
with a vaile o<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> di<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>mulation.
Hence it is very likely would
grow great good liking in the
Prince, and the high way vnto
confidence would be made ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie:
beſides, ſince needs be muſt
lie open vnto ſome, it is cleere,
he will ſooner diſcouer himſelfe
vnto one, to bee of like affect,
and much more if happily the
Courtier be able to ſerue him in
that inclination; wherefore we
ſay it is neceſſary in termes of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
and of dutifull regard
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:10501:70"/>
towards the Prince diſſembling,
to conforme himſelfe in ſome
part to the coloured affect and
faſhion. But to make paſſage
vnto confidence, it is more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
to giue apparent ſignes
of a true, or a truly diſſembled
inclining in himſelfe, the which
inclining muſt bee like to that
which he knowes truly to be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
in the Prince, vnto whoſe
humour in my opinion this is
the next way to bee conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>

               <p>WE come now to ſpeake
of the conferences with
the Prince, and firſt of all let
vs conſider, if it be profitable
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:10501:70"/>
to the Courtier to haue eaſie ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
vnto the Princes eares, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
on the negatiue part, it
ſeemeth there are theſe reaſons,
as doubtleſſe that this manifeſt
fauour breedeth him great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie
with the other Courtiers,
and how pernitious a thing that
is, is very plaine, whereof wee
mind to ſpeake at large in due
place: beſides many informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are made vnto the Prince,
whoſe author not being known,
it is attributed vnto thoſe, who
often haue conference with
him, whereupon followeth the
hatred, not alone of thoſe offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
but of others who haue rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to feare the like, beſide the
note of a malignant detractor.
Heereunto is added a waightie
conſideration, that in reaſoning
the Courtier vſeth many or few
words: if few, he doth not fit his
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:10501:71"/>
Lords intention, who many
times giues him this acceſſe,
for entertainment of the time
which he deſireth. In this caſe to
walke too warily, beſides that it
makes a ſhew either of a ſeuere
or a diſſembled nature, it giues
no pleaſing guſt, but breeds a
diffidence: if many wordes, a
prouident and wittie Prince,
(ſuch as we ſuppoſe the Prince
worthie to bee ſerued by our
Courtier inſtructed in this art)
will eaſily ſee into his manners
and affections, which happily
with more profit might haue
been concealed, nor can this be
but very hardly holpen, becauſe
the Courtier being to make an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to demands, and to perſiſt
in his diſcourſe, ſo long as it ſhall
pleaſe the Prince, it is almoſt
impoſſible to go ſo couertly to
worke, that truth it ſelfe glides
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:10501:71"/>
not, or glanceth out ſometime.
And ſurely as loue is a moſt
ſweet torture, which oftentimes
vnlockes the cabinet of cloſeth

               <p>But for all this there are on
the part affirmatiue, more liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reaſons and of greater force,
becauſe for certainty amongſt
all the paſſages offered to the

Princes fauour, there is not one
of them, that by a more plaine
and eaſie way doth lead to our

ſeruant may bee with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerenced
maſter: It giues fit oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
&amp; opportunity to beare
his humors and affections, and
to giue an earneſt &amp; taſte of our
owne proper vertue and valor:
a thing not of ſmall regard with
thoſe who conſider how many
are in Court who through want
of that commoditie to make
their talent known vnto their
Prince, keepe the ſame buried
in ſterilitie. Beſides the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which it brings is held ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimable,
not alone, becauſe
making profit of the Princes
iudgement, hee cannot but
bee commended alſo, who is
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:10501:72"/>
thought worthy his domeſticke

I muſt not leaue to note;
that for oftentimes in reaſoning

or elſe the dulneſſe and pouerty
of ſpirit is diſcouered, it is a

reaſonable, that by how much

finde ſome kind of Princes, that

with the Prince in caſe of being
too brief or too large in ſpeech,

vnto others too abundant and
plentifull, aduiſing to correct
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:10501:76"/>
natures defect by the helpe of
art, giuing ſuppliment to want,
&amp; abatement to abundance, by
a iudicious preſcription, which
in ſuch like caſes muſt bee the
trueſt leuell, and wherewith he
muſt be fully fraught, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to port himſelfe in the
chiefeſt harbour of his Princes
fauour. But as touching the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduiſed
manifeſting his defects
or diſcouering ſome thing elſe
that might be dangerous, we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer:
this art is not ſet down to
men of ſo ſlight a ſtuffe, that are
not maſters of their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts,
and who cannot ſhelter
or defend themſelues (if at leaſt
they cannot auoid and hide the
ſame) in ſuch ſort, as with ſilence
to ouerpaſſe that which for

But vnto ſuch as muſt be
apt to ſincke into the inmoſt
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:10501:76"/>
parts of his Prince, by meanes
of things connext in one, or
many ſpeeches: forming vnto
himſelfe by vertue of them, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
concluſions, the which if
not demonſtratiuely and by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie,
yet at leaſt by conie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
and other obſeruations
taught before, may giue notice,
what are his inclinements, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,

may as well wiſely detect his

danger to bee detected by the

denied, the Commander to
haue the aduantage in this eſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al

it doth belong to interrogate,
continue or to change diſcourſe
at pleaſure: yet theſe things do
not conclude, that to haue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

it is neceſſarie that we treat in

which the Courtier may haue

What is to bee obſerued in the
paſſing of this conference
of ſtate.</head>
               <p>THe conuenient and fit time
with ſpeciall conſideration
being taken, and the houre of
negotiating being come, the
circumſpect ſeruant, muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
firſt, or in the very inſtant,
or ſo ſoone as may be, by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
or by ſome other meanes
diſcouer the moode &amp; humor,
that the Prince is in, for all are
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:10501:79"/>
not of <hi>Tiberius</hi> mind, of whom
<hi>Tacitus</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Ann. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Negotia pro ſolatijs
accipiebat,</hi> that tooke diſpatches
for diſports: and much leſſe it
may bee to finde him ſtill in one
minde, nor to haue the ſame
motion to the ſame things.
Wherefore diſcouering an indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
to the buſineſſe, either
by ſome affect of his minde
or body, it is expedient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine
the conference into as
few termes as may bee, and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge
the time, from being
troubleſome; for the ill diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the ſubiect with whom
wee are to treat, is no leſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the happie ſucceſſe
of the buſineſſe, then is an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely
houre. I vnderſtand
this of affaires which neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
muſt paſſe, and needs
bee heard, becauſe in others,
whoſe ſcope and end are the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:10501:80" rendition="simple:additions"/>
or profit of our friends, or
elſe containe ſome deſired fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour,
wee muſt of neceſſity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waight
<hi>fandi molles aditus,</hi> eaſie
entrances of ſpeech, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
reſerue them till there be a
compoſed, quiet &amp; ſetled mind
willingly diſpoſed to giue audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
a thing which very ſeldom
falleth out with ſome, who are
ſo auſtere and ſterne, that it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
impoſſible euer to find ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
fit houre or humor to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
with them. Such are men
giuen to their pleaſures &amp; paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
beſides the which they
thinke on nothing elſe: and ſuch
are men cholerick by cuſtom or
by nature, in whom either age or
practiſe in managing affaires
hath not bred a gentler temper.
But if the Prince bee well diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
then muſt the Courtier en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour
himſelfe that the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:10501:80"/>
whereof hee is to ſpeake
(for ſomuch as belongeth vnto
him) bee aptly and commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
ſet downe and handled. For
the knowledge whereof he ſhall
vnderſtand, that to negotiate
with a Prince, may conſiſt either
in laying open or declaring
ſome fact or ſeruice done, to the
end he conſider thereof as hee
thinkes good; or manifeſting
ſome buſineſſe, to the end to
receiue order for the execution
and performance. And heerein
alſo is contained the fauours or
recompences which either for
himſelfe or others are deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and in the one or the other
the opening or concealing his
opinion; or finally in declaring
the maner of execution and
performance of ſome action,
which is commonly called a
<hi>Relation.</hi> Wherefore in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:10501:81"/>
any thing whatſoeuer we
muſt firſt and chiefly haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to truth, aſwell for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity,
duty and faith due by
euery honourable Courtier vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Prince, as becauſe hee
may make a more commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
reſolution, knowing that
from falſe principles in good
conſequence a true concluſion
is neuer gathered: next there is
requiſite <hi>apparancy,</hi> to eaſe the
vnderſtanding of the Prince,
and lighten the burthen of the
buſineſſe and <hi>breuity:</hi> Not to
keepe him troubled ouerlong
hauing otherwiſe many diuerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

directions for the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
of any thing, either by
himſelfe or others, there is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
not onely a diligent at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of the mind, rightly and
preſently to take the ſame, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:10501:81"/>
neceſſity of repetition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
this, beſides the trouble,
would breed an opinion in the
Prince, of incapacity, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
a want of memory and reten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to performe the ſame an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable
to the intent of the
commandement.</p>
               <p>But of all the reſt, there is
none of more import, than the
charge to giue aduice and ſhew
his opinion vpon any thing:<note place="margin">Lib. 1. hiſt.</note>
                  <hi>Nam ſuadere principi quod opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teat,
multi laboris,</hi> ſaith <hi>Tacitus,</hi>
it is a hard taske to perſwade a
Prince to doe that hee ought.
Whereupon it is neceſſarie to
note not to deale therein but by
command, when the bond of
your office doth not require it,
and howſoeuer it is fit to vſe
modeſty, not to ſeeme too wiſe,
and by all meanes poſſible to
auoid obſtinacy in your owne
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:10501:82"/>
conceipts, eſpecially againſt the
opinion and iudgement of the
Prince. There is heerein requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
wiſdome as the mother of
all good counſel, and a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratiue
inclination of loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him, to the end that with
the more facility, he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
that which is propounded
for your profit.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, in declaring things al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
executed you muſt vſe
<hi>truth, plaineneſſe,</hi> &amp; al that good

a worthy <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ation. But to all
theſe things there are two moſt
important aduertizements yet
to be added; the firſt is <hi>Secrecie,</hi>
becauſe without that, in vaine
is the Princes confidence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured,
whoſe thoughts and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,
by ſo much as is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
muſt be kept concealed, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
for the inconueniences
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:10501:82"/>
which may grow thereby, as
for your own reputation, which
will be ſo much the greater, as
theſe ſhall bee the more occult
and ſecret. The other is, not to
vſe too great curioſity, in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
deeper into the Princes
thoughts, then is conuenient,
or hee thinks fit to reueale, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring
that, <hi>abditos princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis

buſie in queſt of Princes ſecret
thoghts, or what vnlawful drifts
they haue in hand, is both dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
and doubtfull. And for
certaine many haue erred heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
whereof haue followed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
effects to their deſires,
becauſe ſeeking by this meanes
to lincke and inward them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues

               <p>BY how much theſe confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences

happily theſe open more the

theſe being induced &amp; brought
in by choice and for pleaſure,
bring foorth many times by
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:10501:83"/>
their continuance, ſuch delight
and ſweetneſſe to the Prince,
that willingly hee riterates the
ſame, and by little and little, lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
aſide Princely ſeuerity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
by this familiarity to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate
the Courtiers condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
neerer to that of his ſtate,
and in time breeds a diſpoſition
to participate and impart vnto
him many things, and ſo ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiuely
doth enable him to take
knowledge of his moſt ſecret
thoughts; either hid from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
or onely knowne by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of their offices, not by free
election of good liking, and
therefore it may be not ſo fully
imparted.</p>
               <p>Wherefore occaſion of ſuch
conference with the Prince may
riſe, either of his owne nature,
who will daine the familiaritie
of his ſeruants, reſpectiuely in
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:10501:84"/>
termes and degrees to the one
and other conuenient, or by
ſome incident occaſion, as time
and place affoordeth many, or
by the Courtiers qualities. And
ſurely if the Prince be of nature
conuerſable with his ſeruants,
the way to diſcourſe and talke
with him will bee plaine and
needs no art at all: ſince either
himſelf by demanding, recoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
or propounding will offer
occaſion of entertainment. In
theſe accidentall conferences
there can no rule be giuen; and
that which in them is to bee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertized,
ſhall be noted in ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of the occaſions which the
quality of the <hi>Courtier</hi> may of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
whereof wee will now begin
to treat.</p>
               <p>Since then theſe ſpeeches are
brought in for the pleaſure and
entertainment of the Prince, it is
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:10501:84"/>
cleare, that willingly hee would
paſſe them with ciuill and well
ſpeaking perſons, full of nouel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and pleaſant deuices to am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifie
and prolong a diſcourſe.
To be <hi>Iouial</hi> and conceited is a
gift of nature, which receiueth
little helpe by arte, howbeit ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
haue attempted to giue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
of vrbanity and merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
The diſpoſition alſo and
ability of ſpeaking well, is
brought likewiſe from the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
wombe, but heerein with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all doubt Art hath a ſpeciall
ſhare, ſince that if by a glibbe
tongue and a hot temperature
of the braine well fraught with
naturall conceits, there be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned
a knowledge of many
things: the arte of apt &amp; proper
ſpeech ioined with that which
more importeth and helpeth
<hi>iudgement</hi> and <hi>diſcretion,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:10501:85"/>
all difficultie he will prooue
commendable and excellent in
diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>Nouelties are gotten by cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſitie,
and though with a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Prince, doctrine and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
be great helpers heerunto,
he muſt not for all this, neglect
the knowledge of ſuch things
as daily do occur, aſwell within
as without his dominions, ſo
that the matter of theſe diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
may bee ſufficiently ready at
hand; becauſe the disburdened
Prince, allured by ſuch like qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
will take occaſion to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
with him for the time he
ſhall ſtand free from greater
cares. But for that it is no leſſe
neceſſary to offer meat vnto the
queaſie and weake ſtomacks for
natures ſuſtenance, than to the
hunger-ſtarued mawe, and by
deuice of artificiall ſmels and
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:10501:85"/>
exquiſite delicacies, prouoke
their appetites: the prouident
Courtier, at houres moſt fit and
time conuenient, be it either af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
meales, when not to hinder
true concoction by withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the vitall ſpirits from the
ſtomack, it is ouerruled by Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke,
that for a while our minds
haue leaue to play, or at ſome
other time when hee ſhall ſpie
the Prince at leiſure (to which
purpoſe diligent attendance in
the <hi>preſence</hi> much importeth)
hee muſt inſinuate and mooue
ſome of thoſe things which hee
ſhall find moſt apt to pleaſe his
taſte and giue delight, which if
he once perceiue (by vacancy
of greater thoughts) hee take
well, then may he goe on ſafely
and with dexterity glide from
one thing to another as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
is vſed in long talke. But
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:10501:86"/>
if there ſhall bee no diſpoſition,
as quickly a nimble eied Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier
will perceiue, noting his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
bowed downe with
waighty thoughts, or ſilent not
willing to anſwer, or vſing bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uity

(in ſum) to chop off occaſion,
cut off multiplicity of words,
then, <hi>huſht,</hi> he muſt retire, and
look for better opportunity, or
more befitting humour in the
Prince, or ſeeke ſome accident
which oftentimes fals out, either
by ſome flying newes, or chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
happening in the city, court
or other countries, which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

ſome intereſt which hee may

endeuour to entertaine &amp;

generally, it is notorious, that
pleaſantneſſe and ieſting com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly

there be danger of ſlipping into

it will be very eaſie to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate

that doing thus, (but ſo that the

treatiſe, we will heere ſerue our
turnes only with the firſt part,
wherein the moſt inward and
eſſentiall nature thereof is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
that is, that it is a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation:</hi>
then will wee exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the differences, which are
<hi>falſe</hi> or <hi>amplified.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:10501:91"/>
Inſomuch then as it is <hi>Praiſe</hi>
or <hi>Commendation,</hi> it is neceſſary
that it fall vpon ſome good part
in the Prince, ſince the obiect of
praiſe is good parts. The good
parts (becauſe it is now no time
to play the Phyloſopher) wee
ſay are of three ſorts, of the
<hi>minde,</hi> the <hi>body,</hi> and the <hi>exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.</hi>
The good parts of the
minde are vertue and the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
powers and faculties, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we doe not onely praiſe
<hi>temperance, fortitude, liberalitie,</hi>
&amp;c. but a <hi>pregnant</hi> and <hi>quicke
vnderſtanding,</hi> a vigilant and
prouident minde; and becauſe
theſe are ſometimes the effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
cauſe, or cauſe conſeruant
of the outward parts, it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that praiſing the externall
parts wee commend alſo the
cauſes of them. But to conclude,
the principall commendations
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:10501:91"/>
and moſt of all to be deſired, is
that of the vertues of the mind:
true it is that theſe are not of all
men alike priſed and eſteemed,
there being many who had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be commended for wealth,
power and honour, than for
wiſedome, magnanimity and
beneficence; nay there be ſome
ſo blind of vnderſtanding, that
had rather be accompted faire,
comely, agile and gallant of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
than more or as learned as
<hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> or eloquent as <hi>Cicero;</hi>
and who doubteth but that it
was more gratefull and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
to <hi>Nero</hi> the praiſe of his
ſinging than whatſoeuer other
commendation either of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance,
modeſty or iuſtice?
And queſtionleſſe if any man
ſhould take vpon him to adde
vnto the female ſex, all thoſe
commendations and applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,

that pleaſing eloquence
could figure or paint out, but
would abate their beauty out of
it, I thinke there is none but
knowes, how welcome and how
gratefull ſuch honor ſhould be
to any woman. Wherefore
though the true and reall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations
is principally to be
attributed to the aboue named
good parts, it is notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
very neceſſary, if the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier
will commend with profit
&amp; to be pleaſing, that he praiſe
that whereunto he ſees the
Prince moſt inclined and beſt
to ſatisfie himſelfe, vrging this
as a thing of moſt ſpeciall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
aiding himſelfe, with
the knowledge of his nature,
cuſtome and inclination.</p>
               <p>There is yet an other aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement
of great conſequence,
for the better vnderſtanding
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:10501:93"/>
whereof we ſay thus, that it is
cleere, praiſe and commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is naturally deſired of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man, the reaſon is, becauſe
there is in all men an innated
deſire of perfection, the which
not alone in it ſelfe is moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
and gratefull, but with
a particular pleaſure makes
thoſe things to bee receiued
which giue teſtimony thereof,
no otherwiſe, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as we ſee, that
the comming to paſſe of ſuch
things which we haue longing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deſired, not only to be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
vnto vs, but withall, euen
the meſſenger of ſuch newes is
very acceptable, and oftentimes
munificently rewarded for his
tidings: and therefore by the
ſame reaſon whoſoeuer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth
vs, as a witneſſe of our
perfection, is beloued of vs. But
as in all ratifications falſe teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:10501:94"/>
are by vs greatly hated,
in like manner are vntrue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendours,
who once knowen
for ſuch, doe highly diſpleaſe
vs, becauſe we ſeeme not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
commendations or te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
of any perfection,
which we know to be farre from
vs, but rather an vpbraiding
that wee are not ſuch as they
would make vs ſeeme to bee;
beſides the deformity of the
falſhood which is diſcouered
in them, whereupon we gather
the ſmall confidence that wee
may giue vnto them in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing, as falſe and menda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
beſides the diſgrace they
fall into, as baſe and vulgar
perſons. Of all this thus much
may be gathered, that we muſt
not only be conſiderate in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending,
not to incur ſuſpition
of falſhood, but withall that it
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:10501:94"/>
is not alwaies true that <hi>Galba</hi> is
reported to ſay in <hi>Tacitus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lib. 1. hiſt.</note> that,
<hi>adulatio erga Principem quem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumque
ſine affectu peragitur.</hi>
Flattery or aſſentation to what
Prince ſoeuer, is done without
affect. Wherefore we ſay, that
the commendations being to
bee credited, it is neceſſary to
ground the ſame vpon ſome
vertue or good part really and
in trueth exiſting in the Prince,
or at leaſt in opinion thought
to be in him, and what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable
parts are in the prince
hee may eaſily know, who hath
that notice of him, as we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the <hi>Courtier</hi> ſhould haue:
but of which of them the Prince
makes moſt eſteeme, muſt by
obſeruance bee learned, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
that for the moſt part we
thinke our ſelues beſt indued
with thoſe things whereof we
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:10501:95" rendition="simple:additions"/>
make profeſſion; the muſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
of ſinging well, the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
of the perfect knowledge
of naturall cauſes, the Souldier
of the arte of warre; wherein
being praiſed we eaſily beleeue
it, &amp; willingly accept it. Thoſe
which are proper to a Prince,
are, wiſedome, iuſtice, magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence,
riches, power, glory,
and ſuch like vertues, and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
belonging to a perſon of
ſo high degree, from whence
groweth an affect, which wee
call veneration, which doth
meet or encounter his perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and is as a teſtimony (as
wee haue ſaid of <hi>praiſe,</hi> and
ſhould ſay of all <hi>honour</hi>) of the
good parts which we eſteem to
be in him; the which teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
by how much it is giuen in
greatneſſe, by ſo much is it
thought his abilities and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:10501:95"/>
doe exceed. Of this kinde
is that of <hi>Seianus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lib. 4. Ann.</note> when he ſaith,
<hi>Se ita inſueuiſſe, vt ſpes, votaque
ſua non priùs ad Deos quàm ad
principum aures conferret:</hi> The
great ſignes and expectation
of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> had framed ſuch a
cuſtome in him, that he would
not ſooner offer vp his hopes
and vowes to the gods, than
vnto the eares of Princes, the
which adulation could not with
more cunning haue beene ſet
downe, becauſe hee doth not
only compare, but preferres his
Prince before the gods in a
thing eaſily to be credited: and
ſo ſhewing that which is too
common in experience, that
there bee ſome ſo affectionate
&amp; deuote in their Princes ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice,
that forgetting their due
recourſe to God, lay the whole
burden of their hopes vpon
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:10501:96"/>
the fauour of their Lord.</p>
               <p>But becauſe what hath beene
ſaid hitherto, conſiſteth in the
credit and teſtimony that the
perſon of the Prince and his
vertues or good parts do yeeld,
we muſt no leſſe conſider how
to draw ſome beleefe and truſt
from the perſon of the Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:
and ſurely there is faith gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to ſuch whom wee take to
bee of a free and open nature
and who make ſhew of that in
ſpeech which is within the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſure
of their heart. This o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
is particularly gotten
by reprehending, for whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
falſely commendeth, doth
it (as we haue ſaid) for his owne
profit; but who freely reproo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth,
ſheweth he hath no minde
of other reſpect or intereſt, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will by curring fauour giue
place a iot from his true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:10501:96"/>
Wherefore an ingenuous
and free reprehenſion is alwaies
accompanied with credit &amp; au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.
Tis true that in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
we muſt remember this
<hi>maxime,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tac. lib. 4. hiſt.</note> which ſaith, <hi>Quando
peſſimis Imperatoribus ſire fine
dominationem, ita quamu is egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gijs
modum libertatis placere.</hi>
As an euerlaſting rule is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
euen to the woorſt Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
ſo doth a modeſt kind of
liberty in reprehenſion pleaſe
the greateſt, becauſe if the
Courtier paſſe thoſe bounds in
reproouing, hee may eaſilie
coniecture, what effects would
follow a ſerious ſpeech that
biteth.<note place="margin">Lib. 15. Ann.</note> 
                  <hi>Si facetiae vbi multum
ex vero traxere, acrem ſui memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam
relinquunt:</hi> If ieſts when
they cary much truth with them
do leaue a bitter memory. Hee
muſt therefore diſpraiſe in a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:10501:97"/>
maner, and that may
ſeeme rather a kind of praiſe,
than a iudicious cenſure: which
thing woorthy of ſpeciall obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
is done, not in reprouing
vices, but the exceſſe of ſome
vertue, yet with this aduertize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
not to expreſſe or name
the exceſſe, by thoſe extreames
which otherwiſe indeed are vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and preiudiciall to others,
but by thoſe termes only which
are damageable to the agent,
with the profit of others. As for
example, it is a vertue to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſible
and willing to giue au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
and not eaſily wearied in
diſpatches; if then one ſhould
ſay vnto the Prince, that throgh
too vehement a deſire to ſatisfie
others, hee ouerchargeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
both in mind and body to
the preiudice of his health wher
of he hath no due reſpect; hee
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:10501:97"/>
ſhould reproue him with a kind
of flattery. Sobriety and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
abſtinence is commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable;
who now would ſhew
that he offendeth in being too
ſtrict in dangering his health,
ſhould ſmoothingly admoniſh
him, and worke two notable ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
one, that by the reproofe
he gaineth credit, the other that
he diſcouers an affection and
intereſt in the Princes health:
But theſe obſeruations cannot
bee put in practiſe but by a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
prouident and wiſe Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
who if ſometimes with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
or ſhew of griefe, or a
light anger he ioin theſe admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments
it will greatly increaſe
his credit, becauſe ſuch affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of freedome and plainneſſe
would wholly remooue and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh
all ſuſpition of diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
whereunto alſo will adde
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:10501:98" rendition="simple:additions"/>
very much the auoiding of all
affectation, and ſhunning this
<hi>decorum</hi> and <hi>ſeeming-wiſe-gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie,</hi>
in your reprehenſions. But
aboue all, the moſt aſſured way
to ſettle and gaine credit, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
and in all your actions to
ſhew your ſelfe ſuch as you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
that the Prince may haue
this conceit of you, that you are
an ingenuous, free, and plaine
man. And this is ſo much as I
hold may be obſerued in <hi>praiſe</hi>
and <hi>flatterie,</hi> adding this as a
note, that true praiſe when there
is matter and ſubiect for it, is to
be preferred, and in defect or
want therof, to haue immediate
recourſe to adulation or flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
the which conſiſteth in a
little amplifying or enlarging,
and is not altogether diſioyned
from perfect commendations:
But when there is no matter
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:10501:98"/>
at all to worke on, it is lawfull to
helpe your ſelfe with that kinde
which makes an attribute of
ſome good parts where none
are, yet with that caution and
circumſpection which wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
haue ſignified.</p>

               <p>IF theſe aſſaies ſhall be made
by Princes of ſmall experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
it will bee no great labour
for the Courtier to diſcouer
them, but becauſe wee haue
preſuppoſed he is to deale with
a perſon circumſpect and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relous,
we ſay, that the firſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie
is, to haue a feeling that
he is felt, or rather to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
and peize the full waight
and meaning of euery word the
Prince ſhall ſpeake, it being
cleere, that diſcourſes to this
end, will paſſe vailed vnder fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratiue
and ambiguous ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
not much vnlike to <hi>Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi>
concluding with ſuch ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcuritie
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:10501:101"/>
and clowdineſſe, that
the diſciphering and conceit of
them wil be very difficil to him
whom nature hath not giuen a
wit more pregnant, ſharpe and
prouident, than to the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.
Wherefore this firſt point
falls out within the compaſſe of
our arte, becauſe to be heedy &amp;
watchfull, is not a thing that
precepts can affoord, if nature
liſt not to be bountifull. But vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
the force of the
wordes, and perceiuing this
treaty is but to tempt, Art here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
may yeeld great help, in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couery
betweene a true and fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
triall, that is, which of them
the Prince doth to the end to
vſe the Courtiers helpe therein,
if happily he accept the charge,
and which of them, but for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couerie
of his inclinations and
affections.</p>

Firſt therfore when the Prince
purpoſeth but to feele or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine,
his deſire is onely
the knowledge of the Courtiers
intentions, whereupon becauſe
he hath the greater intereſt, he
doth it with the more regard
and leſſe feare, but hauing a
minde actually to command
and impoſe ſome charge from
which the Courtier may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
retire himſelfe, hee tries
him then more baſhfully and
more warily: heereof it follows
that theſe <hi>Soundings</hi> are made
with more circumſpection and
more obſcuritie, ſo that not fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the foord paſable, it ſhall
be in the Princes power to ſtep
backe without danger of diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie.
The other <hi>Vnderminings</hi>
which are vndertaken by diſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation,
&amp; falſly, are only done
to winne the knowledge of the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:10501:102"/>
                  <hi>Courtiers</hi> nature, albeit they are
no leſſe by a wiſe Prince to be
handled with great dexteritie &amp;
arte; yet becauſe the impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue
cauſe bindes not ſo much,
they are done ſomewhat more
plainlie. This is then a proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:10501:103"/>
that difficulty, that there
ſhould neede many precepts,
and leſſe doth it belong to this
arte to ſet them down, but thus
much may be ſaid, that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and quality of the thing
being perfectly knowen, wee
muſt conferre the ſame with
the propenſity and inclination
of the Prince, meditating whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
any ſuch diſpoſition may
in any likely-hood, ingender
in him ſuch a cogitation or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
of the ſame or ſuch like
thing. For example, who
knowing the nature of the
Prince to bee ſterne, ſeuere,
temperatly giuen to his affairs,
abhorring &amp; deteſting laſciui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
pleaſures, ſhould finde him
make a triall in motion, of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous
thoughts and paſſions
of loue; might well ſuſpect this
motion to bee falſe, for that
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:10501:103"/>
comparing the cauſe with the
nature of the Prince, he ſhould
not finde that ſympathie or
correſpondence that belongs.
Howbeit to this conſideration,
it were fit to ioyne that of <hi>acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents</hi>
or <hi>occaſions,</hi> becauſe many
times a naturall diſpoſition by
ſome euent or other chance,
may be ſo changed, that who
hath not ſpeciall regard there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
ſhall often be deceiued:
as if to a Prince of a quiet
pleaſing nature, forgetfull of
wrongs, there were ſome no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
iniury offered whereby
hee ſhould bee much ingaged
or ſtained in reputation, if hee
ſhould not by his beſt inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours
procure reuenge, or were
it for ſome other ſpeciall cauſe
he muſt put on reuenge; hee
ſhould bee mightily deceiued,
who either not knowing, or
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:10501:104"/>
not aduertiſing ſuch accidents
ſhould ground his iudgement
only in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paring of the thing,
that is, <hi>reuenge,</hi> with the nature
of the Prince: Wherefore the
knowledge of <hi>occaſions</hi> and of
<hi>accidents</hi> which intercur, is
very neceſſary for diſtinction
of theſe feeling motions. And
this may be obteined by a curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
obſeruation, the which
(leauing as impertinent to
ſearch the ſecrets of his Prince)
as a moſt profitable quality is
highly to bee commended in
the Courtier, for by knowing
many things; he ſhall with the
more facility take the better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions
in many caſes. And
therefore we may not let ſlip in
his fit place to ſet downe the
meanes how with eaſe to come
to the knowledge of all that is
done and ſaid in Court.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:10501:104"/>
The conſideration of the
<hi>Courtiers proper actions,</hi> is alſo
no leſſe needfull in this diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
for that either they are
ſuch, as eaſily diſcouer his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
affections and naturall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations,
&amp; are taken as open
and free, or elſe ſuch as giue a
ſhew of diſſimulation, and
ſeeme not of themſelues ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to diſcouer his intentions.
Who then hath ſhewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
free and plaine, hath no
reaſon to ſuſpect that he is felt
or vndermined, for his minde
or diſpoſitions ſake already pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſed
to bee knowen by his
actions; but rather to finde
how he is inclined in the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
or refuſall of the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of that charge which may be
impoſed vpon him. On the
other ſide, who hath carried
himſelfe circumſpectly, hath
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:10501:105"/>
more reaſon to beleeue that the
Prince doth ſound him, to finde
the depth of his conceits and
humour; yet heere we may not
let to ſay, but that theſe plaine
and open Courtiers may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
too, either in things wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they are already known as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
and diſpoſed, or in their
contraries. In thoſe then wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
their diiſpoſition is already
knowen, it is moſt true, theſe
trials cannot be for their diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery,
but it may well fall out in
that which is the contrary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
though it ſeeme very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
that the contrary diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
takes away all confidence
to receiue any benefit by their
ſeruice, notwithſtanding, who
is in a longing deſire, vſeth by
all circumſtances to giue his
hope an eaſie paſſage not to
finde a contradiction; and to
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:10501:105"/>
conclude, in the ſelfe ſame
things may falſe alarmes and
trials be made. For our minde
being ſo full of lurking corners,
a man can neuer ſo well aſſure
himſelfe of anothers outward
thoughts, that ſome ſcruple or
ambiguitie will not ſtill remain.
But here we muſt make a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
becauſe things openly
profeſſed, are either commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
or wicked: if they be bad,
tis plaine, that for ſuch we muſt
take the diſpoſition of the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier
that profeſſeth them, as his
actions ſhew for; for he ſhould
be too great an <hi>ignorant,</hi> who
hauing a vertuous bent and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
would maske it with a
ſhew of vice and wickedneſſe,
neither doth ciuill cuſtome ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
it, as our <hi>Moraliſts</hi> report,
who make it lawfull to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizans
and Mechaniſts to doe
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:10501:106"/>
their worke by arte or without
arte. But the Artificer of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
(if we may terme it ſo) muſt
neuer chuſe to doe any thing
contrary to vertue; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
he ſhould neuer commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
be faſhioned. Wherefore
who openly makes ſhew to be
enclined well, ſhall neuer falſly
be attempted in his owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion:
yet thoſe which do but
giue a taſte therof (as hath been
ſayd) may looke for triall now
or then.</p>

or bring him to the crucible of

this proofe be really made to

it reſteth to ſet downe how hee
is to gouerne himſelfe fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to make profit of ſuch occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
offered. Wee ſay then, that
by what already hath bene ſaid,
it is well knowen to what acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
the Courtiers dutie bindes
him, what actions are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined

are directly contrary vnto his

another diſtinction, that
is, of <hi>falſe</hi> or <hi>true</hi> trials, we may
ſay, that if theſe trials be known
for falſe, falling vpon things
contrary vnto duty in that kind
which may diſtaine his honour,
there is no doubt but reſolutely
and without feare of offence he
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:10501:107"/>
may giue the repulſe, denying
that which with his honour hee
can not grant vnto, and which
hee knoweth not if ſeriouſlie
motioned or deſired, or rather
it ſhould be much to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
to ſhew a mind abhorring
all ſuch thoughts. But this is
when you know you are to
deale with a Prince vertuouſly
addicted: for if otherwiſe, you
might put in practiſe the rule
before ſet downe, of fitting your
ſelfe vnto the Princes humour,
ſhewing your ſelfe either artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
or truely to be like vnto
him. And this may you doe in
all things when theſe attempts
ſhall be made for diſcouerie of
your faſhions onely; ſith there
growing no effect or action
thereupon, there will be no
danger of impeachment in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour:
and beſides, you ſhall
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:10501:107"/>
notably gaine the beneuolence
and fauour of the Prince by this
conformity of thoughts and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination.
But here riſeth a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie,
whereunto neceſſarilie
conſideration muſt be had, for
diſcouering a diſpoſition like
vnto that of the Prince, euen in
matters of ſmall commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
if it ſhall giue an occaſion
of hope, that the Prince reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

the ſame, a thing which
following, in effect blotteth
and ſtaineth the authour of the
worke, and denying it moues a
diſdaine in the Commander;
and ſo much the greater, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing
himſelfe deceiued by
the Courtiers falſe diſſembling
ſpeech. On the other ſide, to
ſhew himſelfe farre from the
humour of the Prince, is not
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:10501:108"/>
anſwerable to that diſcretion
which hath beene ſaid, muſt be
vſed therein, for the better ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teining
of his fauour: wherfore
it ſeemeth beſt to keepe the
middle path, neither to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
too great a woonder, or
too great a niceneſſe of thoſe
thoughts which we ſhall know
in the Prince, either by naturall
inclination or by accident; and
no leſſe altogether to ſeeme ſo
pliable and conformable (parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
in thoſe which are awai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
on with little credit) as to
giue him hope to find the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier
at his pleaſure, to be his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
in them, although in
ſome things which are repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to his proper benefit, or
not comprized in the ſeruice
belonging to a Courtier, hee
muſt ſhew himſelfe moſt ready,
and more deſirous of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:10501:108"/>
ſatisfaction, than whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

the feeling motion be ſincerely
made to vſe the <hi>Courtier</hi> as a
miniſter in ſome thing, wherein
he is not compelled to diſcouer
his own nature and inclination,
but only his will and agreement
to the command, hee muſt in
this alſo diſtinguiſh the matter
and the ſubiect; for if the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand

actions, although they be not
within the limits of his duetie,
but meerely contrary vnto his
profit, he muſt offer himſelfe
moſt prone and willing, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
that by how much his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dutie
extends but vnto pettie
things, by ſo much the more
ſhall be oblige the Prince to be

all the difficulty conſiſteth in

Not onely the actors of

were but made acquainted
therewithall, are looked on as
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:10501:109"/>
vpbraiders of the ſame, and that
eſpecially when they ſhall deny
their helpe, in the execution
whereof wee may ſay heerein,
that if there be not an error in
the election of the Prince at
firſt, this difficulty will not hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
becauſe ſeruing of a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
lord there is no cauſe to
feare commandements leaning
to diſhoneſty. But yet when
either by the foreſaid error, or
by other accident, you ſhall
finde your ſelfe in ſo doubtfull
a caſe of counſell; then muſt
the honorable Courtier by
force of the obſtinate anchor of
vertuous purpoſes, reſiſt the
blaſts of his Princes bad perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
or commands, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
that, by obeying him, his
aſſured loſſe ſhould far exceed
the eſtimate of any gaine, which
hee might looke for by his
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:10501:110"/>
grace: yet will I not leaue to
giue aduertiſment here, that in
this iudgement of the actions
which may ſeeme contrary to
his purpoſe, or hurtfull, or of
ſmall reputation, the Courtier
muſt not with too ſeuere a cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
or a piercing eie examine
or behold the ſame, ſince many
things are permitted and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
vnder the neceſſity of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice,
ſo that they are not tainted
with that turpitude or ill, being
not performed by a free and
willing choice, or at leaſt, not
with more then eaſily may bee
waſht away, by the greatneſſe
of the benefits, which by the
Princes fauour are many times
obtained: whereby it is cleere,
theſe ſcrupulous &amp; nice Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers
can neuer procure confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
ſith he merits no fauor,
that is ſo much friend to his
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:10501:110"/>
owne commodity, that he will
not at leaſt breake a little of the
ſtocke, but after a moſt miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
rate, will ſpend no more
then meere neceſſity conſtrains
him to. To conclude, I muſt
ſay that all ſinnes are not mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall,
and that to the dutie of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
ſo much is pardonable, as
may for the pleaſure and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
of his Prince bee done in
ſome things, if not honorable,
at leaſt without ſuch note of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy,
as in a perſon at full liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
could not be born out with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
paſſing cenſure or incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
blame. Which theſe are,
cannot particularly be pointed
at, but the iudicious Courtier
by himſelfe may well conceiue
them, and chiefly ſince the
worthineſſe and waight of all
actions conſiſteth in the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
and opinion of men. So
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:10501:111"/>
that by what is commonly bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in other which doe ſerue,
either for denying with too
great ſeuerity, or too too gently
granting and aſſenting to the
prince he may eaſily know what
arts of ſeruice are truely to bee
denied, and wherin ſecurely he
may pleaſe and giue ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to his Lord. But when they
are vnbeſeeming and vnfit to
be put in practice, whoſoeuer
doth more eſteeme his honour
and reputation, (before the
which (vertue excepted) there
is nothing amongſt men more
eſtimable) than his Princes fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour,
ought, at leaſt, if not
ſtoutly and boldly, yet reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
tearmes of modeſty and
regard due betweene parties of
vnequality, deny to be actor
or miniſter therein, annexing
to this deniall notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:10501:111"/>
all obſequious and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
duty that words can afford
for iuſt excuſe, to ſmooth and
ſweeten as much as may be, the
bitterneſſe which commonly
doth follow ſuch repulſes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoluing
firmly in his mind, that
for what ſoeuer hope of bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
to ſtand immoueable in his
commendable purpoſe, to doe
or act nothing that may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudiciall
or ſtaine to his reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
hoping rather that this
might finde ſuch force in the
Princes minde, of a well incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
nature, a magnanimous &amp;
generous ſpirit, that euen ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured
with the approoued
goodneſſe of his <hi>Courtier,</hi> hee
will faſhion him vnto his loue,
and that which ſhould haue
beene a cauſe of hate may bee
the beginning of good will and
fauour; a thing which though
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:10501:112"/>
rarely happening, yet is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
and ſometimes comes to
paſſe. Yet if this repulſe take
his true and vſuall courſe, ſo
that the Prince indeede con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
a hatred againſt the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier,
either becauſe hee found
him not reſolute and prompt in

are more reſpected then the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourits
of a friend, becauſe they

Wherefore to haue familiarity,
to bee vſed kindely and held in

lay open the entrance to the

doe, eſpecially than thoſe of

that they ſpeake more confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently,

are their requeſts and fauours
denied, the which is often done

But in this particular you muſt
obſerue and beware, that theſe

becauſe in this caſe ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection

What is to be obſerued with the
Prince for the continuing
in his fauour.</head>
               <p>THere are three thinges
which ſeeme neceſſarie to
bee obſerued with the Prince;
the firſt is, that the fauor being
obteined by diligence and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
giuen in ſeruice, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuere
and goe forward in the
ſame with the ſame termes. The
which thing not onely by thoſe
of meane capacitie, but by
great Courtiers many times to
their greater detriment is neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected.
<hi>Tacitus</hi> ſaith of <hi>Seianus,</hi>
that <hi>nimia fortuna ſocors factus
eſt:</hi> ouer-great fortune had made
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:10501:128"/>
him negligent, a thing for two
reaſons very dangerous; firſt,
the heat of your ſeruice relent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the Princes loue cannot but
grow luke-warme; next becauſe
by this meanes you giue occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to ſome other more diligent
and carefull to make his entry;
wherefore it followeth neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily,
in no caſe to leaue off anie
vſuall obſeruances, nor at anie
time to make ſhew of leſſe fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uencie
in ſeruice: which is very
requiſite, becauſe if the hope of
fauour be the cauſe of a diligent
and commendable ſeruice, by
how much more ought the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
poſſeſſion of the ſame,
cauſe the continuance therein?
The ſecond aduertiſement is,
no more to ſhew, then to be in
deed, an vpright and honorable
man, I meane for no priuate
reſpect to bee inticed to abuſe
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:10501:128"/>
the fauour of his lord, either by
making ſale thereof, by vniuſt
oppreſſions, or offering vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
to pleaſe the vnbridled
appetites of other men and
ſuch like, to the damage and
preiudice of any man, becauſe
ſuch like actions can by no
means be pleaſing to the Prince,
aſwell for the diſcouerie of an
euill qualitie in him that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth
them, of whom it is
to be coniectured he cannot in
reaſon bee aſſured: as for the
wound that by ſo bad a friend
he receaueth in his reputation,
whereof how much Princes
make account, or at leaſt ought
to eſteeme <hi>Tacitus</hi> teacheth ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<note place="margin">Ann. l. 4.</note>
                  <hi>Caetera principibus ſtatim

Princes are in poſſeſſion of all
other things at their will, but
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:10501:129"/>
one thing they muſt inſatiablie
ſeeke after (that is) to leaue a
happie memorie behind them.
And more plainely in an other
place; <hi>Caeteris mortalibus in eo
ſtare conſilia, quid ſibi conducere
putent: Principum diuerſam eſſe
ſortem, quibus praecipua rerum ad
famam dirigenda:</hi> other mens
conſultations only tend to their
profit, but it falleth out other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
with Princes, whoſe actions
chiefly are to bee directed to
fame and reputation. The third
&amp; laſt obſeruation in this point
is, not one iot to diminiſh the
reuerence and duty towards the
Prince, nor becauſe of ſpeciall
confidence to preſume to vſe
familiaritie. And for certeine, I
haue bene aduertiſed by a moſt
inward fauorite of a great Prince
in <hi>Italy,</hi> that by this one obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
hee profited much, and
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:10501:129"/>
that the ſame Prince vſed pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely
to ſay, that in ſo manie
occaſions of familiaritie, he ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
ſtill more freſh, &amp; like one
but newly entred into his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice:
the reaſon heereof is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
obſequious reuerence is
at all times pleaſing, as witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
a ſuperioritie in the perſon
to whom it is vſed. And as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation
is to be eſchewed, ſo
to arrogate or attribute too
much, can by no meanes bee
pleaſing to the Prince; for as
before vpon other occaſion wee
haue alledged:<note place="margin">Tacit. hiſt. li. 4.</note>

               <p>THat part which compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth
his office or carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
towards other courtiers, is
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:10501:130"/>
farre more hard; wherefore it
is fit we diſcourſe thereof more
at large. Firſt it is neceſſary, if it
be poſſible, to make them our
friends &amp; confidents, or at leaſt
not to be our enemies; the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
is, becauſe either directly or
indirectly they may doe ſome
things, whereby our fauor with
the Prince may be diminiſhed,
yea, &amp; happely wholly diuerted
aſwell through the inconſtancy
of the minds of men, as becauſe
no man liues ſo void of errour,
that may not in ſome thing giue
diſguſt vnto his lord, who ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times with too great an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
receiueth that which
malitiouſly is ſuggeſted in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
diſgrace. The obtaining
them to friend, is wrought, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
through benefit or hope.
The Courtiers may diuerſly be
pleaſured by a fauored ſeruant,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:10501:131"/>
as by the aſcribing much vnto
them, by the preferring them
into ſeruice, by promotion, or
by the procureme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of ſome fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor
for them. The chiefeſt way
of winning theſe mens loue,
is to preferre them to be of the
Princes houſholde, becauſe by
this meanes he maketh them his
Creatures and dependants, of
whom he may make ſpeciall vſe
in his occurrences as men great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bound vnto him, of whom
wee will treat in his place, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what profit is drawen from
ſuch kinde of friends. But it is
good to note, not to preferre
men of too great parts, for theſe
grounding their fortunes vpon
their owne deſerts eaſily forget
that bond. And ſuch are the
perfect and true Noble men,
the rich, and thoſe excellent in
any ſpeciall ſcience, arte or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:10501:131"/>
quality. Wherefore
he muſt preferre ſuch as are of
the meane, in birth, faculty and
quality, becauſe the falling into
the other extreame is as vitious,
the reaſon is, for that many
times there are ſome perſons fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured,
who do ſmall credit, or
rather diſgrace their preferrour:
howbeit, there bee ſome that
hold it for a good rule, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
into their ſeruice the moſt
vnapteſt people, as men neither
of bounty nor valour, that by

vnequal compariſon, be thoght
the more glorious afterward:
but this is not befitting in the

The ſame care muſt he haue in
the promoting into any great

The meanes how to obteine of the
Prince thoſe fauours and grace,
which are deſired.</head>
               <p>THe procuring of fauours
from the Prince is both
<hi>profitable</hi> and <hi>honorable</hi> vnto the
Courtier: profitable, by the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
which followeth either to
himſelfe or to thoſe for whom
he obteineth them, who by this
meanes hee maketh much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
vnto him. Honorable,
becauſe he is accounted a fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite,
who hath his Princes wil at
his diſpoſe, and can compaſſe
thoſe fauours which hee pleaſe
either for himſelfe or his friends
&amp; dependents. Wherfore when
the nature of the Prince is of
that kinde which is found in
ſome with great commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:10501:134"/>
though yet but ſeldome;
that is, enclined to beneficence,
he ſhall haue no great need ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of precepts or of arte, more
then onely in ſhewing a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie
in his requeſts, that in no
ſort hee doe manifeſt the leaſt
pretention of expectation, as of
dutie from the Prince, as alſo
not to bee too frequent in theſe
offices, and not to deſire things
ſo impertinent, that woorthely
they may receaue the repulſe.
But when the Prince is neere or
hard in granting fauours, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
becauſe he will not exceed
the limits in doing good vnto
his ſeruants, as doubting they
ſhould abandon him, or to
keepe them in awe that they
grow not ouer confident, or for
the ſmall eſteeme hee makes of
them, or finally for feare they
ſhould ſell his fauours to ſome
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:10501:134"/>
other; in theſe caſes arte is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie.
Wherefore if the hand
be cloſed, fearing to bee forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
it ſhall helpe much to ſhew
a retentiue memorie and grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
for benefits, with a greater
deſire to bee ſeruiceable after a
reward then before. And certes
it ſeemeth iuſt and true, that in
a minde well borne and of good
education and qualitie, a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
reward worketh greater ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
than a future hope. To
conclude, to profeſſe to runne
one and the ſame fortune with
his Prince, and to die in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
of him &amp; his houſe, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to be a conuenient &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate
remedie againſt this
euill. To the ſecond, the ſame
modeſtie continued from his
firſt entrance, euen to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
wherein the Courtier ſhall
be found, helpeth much, not

ſhewing any alteration at all, or
diminution of dutie or reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
as before hath beene no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
But if the Prince be ſtrict
and drie-fiſted in his fauors, for
the ſmall reſpect which natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
he hath of his ſeruants, the
Courtier hath but a weak hope,
where there is ſuch an humour.
Wherefore it is neceſſary either
to endeuour that the Maſter
change copie and ſtile in let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him ſee qualities of woorth,
at leaſt for the affect and apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe

be regarded, or els, this not ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding,
to anſwer him propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally

leſt his fauours ſhould be ſold,
you muſt obſerue that rule a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
ſet downe, which (in fine)
conſiſteth in ſetting the honour

before your eies, and not to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe

               <p>But that hardneſſe which
groweth by nature, not encli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

is hardeſt of all the reſt
to be ouerruled: and truly it is
euident, that there bee ſome
from whom it is impoſſible di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
to deriue any fauour;
wherefore it is fit to vſe arte, and
wiſely to inſinuate occaſions
and reaſons for the fauours he
deſireth, and to attend oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities,
which are eaſily found
by him who continually or for
the moſt part is in preſence of
his Prince, faining ſometime
when need ſhall be, to haue no
affect, motion or deſire of the

chiefly when to this naturall

are not obtained from ſuch
Maſters but by length of time,
and pining expectation, that
there is great patience required
in the ſeruant, who in requitall
heereof oweth him ſmall duty,
being more beholding to his

dexterity, then to the good will
of the Prince; howbeit, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
ſo much as may be, to
conceale this affect or motion,
and to conclude all ſpeeches
with him, with a gratious conge
and giuing thanks; <hi>hic eſt enim

<pb n="247" facs="tcp:10501:137"/>
alſo it followeth that euen the

for nature herſelfe wil not ſuffer

not allured by hope, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced

the Maſter is the rule and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne
of the quality of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
to thoſe that follow him:
whereupon the meaſure falling
out ſcarſe and couetouſly-ſhort
on his ſide, vniuſtly ſhould he
pretend a large abundance or

ſeruants. But all theſe difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
are ſuppoſed not in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of fauor, but in ſleight re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard,
becauſe if any one bee

<pb n="248" facs="tcp:10501:138"/>
loue, he cannot fall into any of
the foreſaid conceits, but diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
of his fauours as it pleaſeth
him, yet regularly and with that
modeſty and wiſdome, which is
required of him who is to deale
with a perſon of that quality as
we preſuppoſe the Prince to be.</p>
               <p>But heere wee muſt not leaue
to ſhew, that the Courtier may
alſo in many other things by an
other way without being ouer
comberſome vnto the Prince,
be a meanes for others of many
fauours; and this conſiſteth in
vſing the helpe of principall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
and miniſters who are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in their charge or may eaſily
finde the occaſion to obtaine
many fauours, or by themſelues
make many reſolutions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the prouident Courtier may
make ſome vſe, either for his
owne or his friends profit and
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:10501:138"/>
commoditie, for that theſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
whereof we ſpeake being
for the moſt part none of the
Princes family, or howſoeuer
if they were thereof, being deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to haue any ſpeciall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
from him, they will wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
endeuour to deſerue the
good will of him whom they
know to bee moſt fauored and
moſt deere; and this courſe
of procuring fauour without
trouble vnto the Prince, is verie
commendable, being conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to reſerue his fauor &amp; helpe
for things of greater impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance:
Beſides this going thus
retiredly and vſing the meanes
of others in their proper char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
is not onely profitable, for
the aboue alleaged reaſons, but
are as teſtimonie of modeſtie &amp;
reuerence towards his Prince:
As though one could neuer ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:10501:139"/>
ſo much in deſert by ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice,
that confidently he might
charge him with expectation of
fauours or rewards. But on the
other ſide, it is neceſſarie to flie
the other extreame; for that
thoſe who fearing to be faſtidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
or troubleſome vnto their
Prince, neuer deſire any fauour
of him, incurre two great er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors;
the firſt is, they loſe the
occaſions to winne to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
aſſured friends and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents;
the other is, that by
theſe meanes they neuer get the
reputation which is incident to
thoſe Courtiers, who make
themſelues knowen to be
beloued and fauored
of the Prince
whom they
ſerue.</p>

Courtier may giue offence, yet
that of detraction and paſſing
bad offices with the Prince to
another mans detriment, ſeemes
to bee moſt proper vnto him
as a Courtier. This was a cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
or arte much vſed by <hi>Seia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
of whom <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi>
hauing ſaid,<note place="margin">Ann. 4. lib. 4.</note> that <hi>fuit audax, ſui
obtegens,</hi> he was bold &amp; a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealor
of his owne deſſeignes:
he ioineth therewithall, <hi>in alios
criminator,</hi> a calumniator or
finde-fault of others. And <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius
Primus</hi> purpoſed as
much, and in effect performed
no leſſe againſt <hi>Mutianus,</hi> who
notwithſtanding with the ſame
weapon, fortunately defended
himſelf, inſomuch that through
the great and manifold good
turnes which <hi>Antonius</hi> had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued
of <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> hee eaſilie
blotted out the memory there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:10501:141"/>
And truely ſince it is ſo, that
no more then one at once, can
well poſſeſſe the chiefeſt place
in the Princes fauour, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie
ſo much as may bee, to
keepe others a loofe off, from
entring in, which chiefly is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by attenuating other

the Princes neglect or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
againſt thoſe in particular,
who for the neereneſſe they are

dangerouſly left in that degree,
without ſome moleſtation.
Howſoeuer, yet this ſeemeth
very abſurd, that any whoſe

a courſe, there being no
ſo apparent a ſigne of any mans

and enuie; beſides, it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
probable, that a wiſe and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
Prince ought not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
into any degree of fauor, a
Courtier who ſhould be knowen
to be apt and prone by nature
and badde inclination to ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
or ſpeake euill to an others
preiudice, becauſe, <hi>Si proditores,
etiam ijs quos anteponunt inuiſt

they hatefull euen to thoſe who
make vſe of them; how much
more ſhould calumniators or
ſlanderers be odious! fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whom
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:10501:142"/>
the Prince (as ſuch kind of men)
receaueth no ſeruice at all, but
rather a cauſe of diſguſt or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
towards thoſe, by whom
happely he might be better ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
then by theſe detractors;
and giueth him occaſion alſo to
doubt, leſt they ſhould arme
themſelues in like terms againſt
himſelfe, with their malignant
toongs, in offence of his honor
and reputation. And certeinly
though it be fit the Prince ſhuld
<hi>omnia ſcire,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tac. in vit. Cor. Agri.</note> and that alſo in his
owne family; that he might the
better gouerne the ſame, there
is no doubt, but the informers
therof are not very gratefull vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, and hatefull vnto all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

this courſe is not onely not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable,

expoſed to many hurts, which
grow many times to that pitch,
that alone they degrade not
the Courtier from the Princes

becauſe if he begin but once to

and to ſurceaſe that dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
proſecution, but to change
and conuert the imagination of
hurt and wrong, into a more
beneuolent and friendly mind.
This ſhall bee a moſt profitable
gaine, and ſo much the more
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:10501:145"/>
commendable, the leſſe it ſhalbe
vſed, ſauing to perſons in whom
vertue in his higheſt degree,
hath wonne the regiment of a
moſt perfect habit, it being na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
very abſurd to bee bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall
to thoſe who are knowen
to be of a peruerſe and ill affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
minde: but becauſe many
times, ſuch is the malignitie of
men, that it cannot be appeaſed
or ouercome by any benefit, it
is neceſſary to take ſome other
courſe, that is, with a reſolute
mind to make proofe who ſhall
in the end preuaile, deuiſing
how to extinguiſh or ſupplant
his aduerſary, not by death, but
by expulſion, either out of
Court or wholly out of fauour.
And this will ſucceed very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely,
and without any great
labour, to him who ſhall be in
ſuch fauour as we now preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:10501:146"/>
him, becauſe he ſhall not
only haue eaſie acceſſe vnto the
Princes eare, whereby he may
haue diſcourſe at his pleaſure,
and take occaſion to do bad of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
againſt his perſecuters, but
he ſhall poſſeſſe a great faction
of friends amongſt the Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
who may ſerue his turne by
<hi>giuing out,</hi> and ſowing in the
Court, yea and with the Prince
himſelfe, the like ſeed of report,
whereby the traducers in the
end ſhall reape the fruits anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to their deſerts. But the
Courtier for his owne part muſt
endeuour to keepe himſelfe in
the good opinion of him againſt
whom hee mindes to reuenge
himſelfe, not giuing the leaſt
occaſion or ſigne of bad ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and keepe himſelfe the
moſt wary and retired in his

<pb n="261" facs="tcp:10501:146"/>
times that may be. And in ſted
heereof he muſt haue his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
ready, by whoſe meanes
he may compaſſe his deſſeigned
purpoſe; as moſt eaſily he ſhall
doe, if beſides this, vpon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
with the Prince, either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing

ſpread of his aduerſarie, he
ſhall ſo much the more confirm
them, by how much he ſhal ſhew
himſelfe the leſſe intereſſed or

we muſt note, that if the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions
on the other ſide be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
and manifeſt, and ſuch as
can not be concealed, and done
as it were in diſgrace; it is then
neceſſary, openly, and not by
cloſe conueiance, to reſiſt them,
for the manifeſtation and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
that thereof may be taken,
both of his authoritie &amp; power
to defend himſelfe and offend
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:10501:147" rendition="simple:additions"/>
others, when he is ſo reſolued:
whereby followeth both a <hi>feare</hi>

their enemies, either for their
reputation in making ſlight re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of wrongs, or the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations
which they procure
in pardoning iniuries, or at leaſt
becauſe by this meanes they
make their enemie the leſſe
heedfull, wherby with the more
eaſe they ſuppreſſe him; <hi>&amp; quo
incautior deciperetur,</hi>

ſaith <hi>Tacitus:</hi> and to the
end he might more vnwarily be
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:10501:147"/>
deceiued, praiſed him openly. I
know not to what purpoſe, but
for certeine, this was the onely
arte &amp; ſleight of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> which
in particular he vſed againſt his
nephew <hi>Germanicus,</hi> and againſt
<hi>Seianus</hi> his fauorite, who liuing
in the fauor of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> did alſo
practiſe it to the ruine and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
of many: and <hi>Mutianus</hi>
by the ſelfe ſame oppreſſed his
Concurrent <hi>Antonius Primus.</hi>
Theſe then are the two meanes
to reſiſt our enemies and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuters
in the Court. But if one
be but of little authoritie or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
with the Prince, and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
maligned in the
obteining thereof, there are two
remedies; the firſt is, to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
himſelfe to the detractours,
ſeeking all the meanes to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
them to be his friends, and
to make them beleeue hee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:10501:148"/>
not any thing more
than themſelues. The other is,
to be an adherent or dependent
to the moſt potent of the court,
vnder whoſe protection he may
liue; or at leaſt to be of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
faction to them, if there
ſhall be any, as it is moſt vſuall
and common among the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers.
To conclude, to ſhun or
take away the occaſion, by inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating
into their fauor, or by
liuing vnder the ſhelter of ſome
other, or els to reſiſt them by
the ſuccor and force of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
faction.</p>

is neceſſary in ſuch caſe to ſhew
the meanes how to preſerue the

<pb n="266" facs="tcp:10501:149"/>
is, that he endeuour by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
ſeruice to out ſtrip his

this being the moſt reall &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
way, ſucceedeth alſo
more ſecurely, tending wholly
and ending in the profit and
commoditie of the Prince, from
whom, as we haue often ſayd,
proportionable fauour muſt be
attended, and expected accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the actual ſeruice done.
But when this courſe is not

as much as is poſſible to thruſt
off, and keepe backe, ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currents

               <p>Beſides all this, it ſerueth

the ſame, as hath bene ſaid,
not onely without offence to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,

ſhould take occaſion to pretend

               <p>But when theſe obſeruations
ſhall not free or ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
the Courtier from this

for the moſt part is <hi>malitious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction,</hi>
if ſhee once ſhew her

ſlanderer;</hi> deuiſing; if it be
poſſible, to remooue him from
the Court, or wholly out of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice;
and to performe the ſame
with the more eaſe, he ſhall doe
well to remember that which a
little before hath beene ſaid,
that is, howbeit the Courtier be
not by himſelfe to performe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
badde offices, hee may
paſſe them notwithſtanding by
meanes of his adherents, in caſe
neceſſity binde him to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
his place; and therefore,
not onely for this purpoſe, but
for many other cauſes, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
that he be well furniſhed
of good ſtore of friends &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidents
of all ſorts, that is, to the
end to be enformed of all that is
done or ſaid in the Court, and
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:10501:154"/>
that for diuers reaſons. As firſt
to vnderſtand what opinion is
held of him amongſt the other
Courtiers, and which of his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are either praiſed or reproo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
making vſe of ſuch aduice
by the way of correction. Next
to diſtinguiſh of faithfull from
fained friends, becauſe euerie
man ſhewes himſelfe louing and
kinde to him whom they know
fauoured of the Prince, though
it may be, really &amp; indeed, they
are the contrary; a thing by
meanes of theſe confidents eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſcouered: ſince they are
conuerſant, he vnderſtand and
obſerue all that paſſeth in the
Court, chiefly entertaining ſome
who ſhall carry ſmall apparence
of being inward with him; for
that vnto ſuch, as not eſteemed
of any great credit, or partialiſts
to the fauoured Courtier, they
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:10501:155"/>
will eaſily vnmaske, and reueale
the very inwards of their harts:
or elſe themſelues being dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
&amp; cunning in this kind as
men of good vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, can
by an inckling eaſily coniecture
the reſt. And laſtly, to know
what is done, yea or thought
by theſe malitious enuiers euen
in their priuate liuing, becauſe
none liueth without ſinne, it
will be eaſie to finde matter to
reproue their bolde malitious
ſlanders with the knowledge of
their owne actions; and being
willing to hurt them that ſhall
goe about to offend or wrong
him, hee may eaſilie by
theſe meanes effect
and bring it to

What the Courtier is to doe who
ſhall finde himſelfe ſlenderly
reſpected of his Prince
or Lord.</head>
               <p>THus much, in my opinion,
may be ſaid for the Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
good aduertiſement: if any
other imagin he can more aptly
and with better method, and
in concluſion with more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations
handle this arte, he
ſhould do great wrong to ciuill
ſocietie, and to the duty which
euery man oweth, (to labour
what in him is for the common
benefit) to defraud the world
from participating of his ſo
good thoughts and abilities. In
the meane time, if any man
happely guided by the rules &amp;
precepts here ſet downe, lanch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
foorth into the dangerous
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:10501:156"/>
maine &amp; current of the Court,
ſhall rather ſuffer ſhipwracke,
than ſafely furdle vp his ſailes
in the deſired hauen. Me thinks
without ſiniſtrouſly iudging of
this doctrine learned by him, he
ſhould call to mind, that among
arts, there are ſome which are
called <hi>Coniecturall;</hi> and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
is, becauſe albeit their teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or inſtructing part propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
a certeine knowen end or
ſcope, from the which there may
demonſtratiuely bee deduced
certeine concluſions, the which
wil make the context of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
both apparent and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,
ſo farre forth as the nature
of things to be acted will giue
leaue or ſuffer; wherein the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt
are of opinion, that it is not
poſſible to frame perfect de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations.
Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the actiue part doth neuer
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:10501:156"/>
of neceſſitie performe the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
end, although it perform
all the actions ſo much as can
be deſired, proportionall and
correſpondent to the ſame. For
ſo we ſee an excellent &amp; famous
Captain, who in euery part hath
performed the dutie of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
charge, yet his hope of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie
may faile him, and not
ſort as hee deſired. So likewiſe
without errour of arte, the moſt
expert Mariner many times lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
himſelfe and the ſhip hee
ſailes in. Nor leſſe vnluckie
ſome times the Phyſitian mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreth
his drugges to the ſicke
patient without hope of helpe.
Nor many times can the apteſt
and moſt artificiall Rhetoritian
remoue a ſetled minde from a
purpoſed reſolution. To leaue
to ſpeake of many ſuch like arts,
the which not by neceſſitie, but
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:10501:157"/>
contingently, and as it were by
fortune or chance, obteine their
deſired ends, the <hi>Courtiers arte</hi>
being amongſt them, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
thereof may worke no
leſſe erroneouſly than thoſe of
other arts called <hi>Coniecturall.</hi>
Wherefore, if after the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance
of the aboue noted ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſements,
that fauor or grace
ſhall not bee obteined, or that
which is much worſe, if by any
accident it ſhuld be loſt ſo that
aſſuredly there were diſcouered
ſmall ſatisfaction in the Prince;
it reſteth, that for the ful accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment
&amp; perfecting of this
worke, we ſhould ſet downe in
this caſe what wee thinke conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
and neceſſarie therein
for the Courtiers benefit.</p>
               <p>And queſtionleſſe there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be a greater torment to the
hart of him that ſerueth, then to
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:10501:157"/>
ſee himſelfe ſlightly regarded or
beloued of his Lord, and this
accident particularly worketh
greateſt effects in thoſe who
haue not their mindes armed
with naturall magnanimity, or
vertuous education, but are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of a diſdainefull ſpirit, not
able to endure the conforming
of their affections, to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript
rule or ſquare of an other
mans opinion, will or direction,
eſpecially in the maner of his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
either in peaceable quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
or vnquiet buſineſſe:
whereupon it followeth many
times, the reſolutions of ſuch
men in theſe caſes are verie
ſtrange and vnconſiderate.</p>
               <p>Wherefore in this ſo doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
a paſſage to conduct him
foorth by the guidance of wiſe
and fruitfull counſell, we firſt
ſay, that as in bodily ſickneſſes,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:10501:158"/>
the cauſe knowen, remedies for
the cure therof are eaſily appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
ſo muſt the Courtier, ſo
much as in him is, diligently
ſeeke out the occaſion that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
his Prince or Lord to bee
angry or not well diſpoſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him, to the end either by
himſelfe, or by meanes of ſome
other to moue him therein: yet
ſo, that it fall not within the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice
of his principal deſignes,
as before hath beene handled,
becauſe then it ſhould be better
to leaue the ſeruice, by crauing
licence to depart. But becauſe
it is a ſaying. <hi>Che piaga, per allen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar
d'arco non ſana;</hi> That the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bending
of the bow is no hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of the wound: ſo is it not
enough many times to remoue
the cauſe of this diſpleaſure, for
the minde notwithſtanding re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines
ſtill exulcerate and gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:10501:158"/>
It is neceſſary therefore
not onely to remooue the cauſe
of this anger, but to proceed in
the obſeruance of thoſe aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements
which the Rhetoriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
teach for the lenefying and
appeaſing of minds once moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
as <hi>humiliation, acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the errour, accuſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
crauing pardon, offring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
readie to all ſatisfaction:</hi> and
continuing with all patience in
theſe courſes, hee may make it
apparent how much he valueth
the fauor &amp; loue of his Prince,
with the ſorrow hee ſuſtaineth
for his diſpleaſure: for this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
growing of an offence,
which conteineth a neglect by
theſe foreſaid demonſtrations,
ſuch a counterpoiſe may bee
made in opinion to be thought
deſpiſed and diſgraced, that in
the end it may bring the Prince
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:10501:159"/>
to put on a more gentle and
pacified minde towards the
Courtier: ſo that this offence
and cauſe of badde ſatisfaction,
haue not taken ſuch roote, that
it prooue rather a hatred then a
diſlike; becauſe that in ſuch
caſe as to a more greeuous ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladie,
a more potent medicine is
neceſſarie; the which manie
times the Courtier by no means
of obſequious diligence ſhal be
able to finde; whereupon hee
muſt haue recourſe to the helpe
of interceſſion and mediation
by ſome others, as the Princes
kindred, his friends, and other
Courtiers in greateſt fauour.</p>
               <p>But if none of theſe courſes
can ſtay the wrath nor appeaſe
the ſame, ſo that the hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couerie
of fauour be wholly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct,
the <hi>End</hi> and <hi>Scope</hi> of his
ſeruice being taken away: it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:10501:159"/>
followeth, that the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie
alſo betweene the Prince
and the Courtier ſhould be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued
by his abandoning and
leauing of the ſeruice. This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
muſt bee taken but vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
vrgent neceſſitie, for that
otherwiſe it would come ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
to paſſe, but that the
<hi>Courtier</hi> ſhould incur great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment,
either by opinion of
ſome ſpeciall want in him, and
chiefly in thoſe that haue liued
in greateſt fauour; or of ſome
raſh preſumption, as ſuppoſing
nothing can coequall his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts;
or of an inconſtancie of
nature which will neuer conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
long in one courſe; or fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
by the loſſe of a Princes
protection, beſides his time, &amp;
it may be, the flower of his age
vainely ſpent, and to ſmall pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;
things all of them of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:10501:160"/>
regard and eſtimation. But
when the caſe is deſperate, it
ſhall bee better to beſtow the
remnant of his life, in ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſeruice or imploiment, then
vnfruitfully to ſerue, where he
may ſooner expect a ſudden
diſcharge, than hope to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe
any of thoſe <hi>Ends,</hi> which
whoſoeuer ſerueth in Court
doth aime at and
propound.
