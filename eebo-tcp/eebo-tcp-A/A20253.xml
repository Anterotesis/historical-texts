            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

uſually plead and I might alſo if I would, the
importunity of friends, or that I thought in my

to the preſſe; but eſpecially a vehement deſire
which I had to teſtifie unto the world, how faine
I would (if I could tell how) expreſſe my thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullnes

me from my very cradle unto this preſent; which
have been ſo many that they cannot be ſpecified:
for you have done with me as the young Lady

you take no pleaſure to ſee your goodnes

               <q>I Awake ye drunkards, and weep and houle all
ye drinkers of wine; for the new wine ſhall be
taken from your mouthes.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is DAVID's aſſertion,<note place="margin">Pſal. 107. 34</note> that
<hi>God turnes a fruitfull land in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
barrenneſſe for the ſinnes of
thoſe that dwell therein:</hi> the
truth of this we ſee verified
here in the land of Iudah, a
fruitful land, a land that flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with milke and hony, yet became barren for
the ſinnes of thoſe that inhabited the ſame; for
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:25329:5"/>
ſo we may reade in the verſe going before; <hi>That
which the Palmerworme had left, the Locuſt had
eaten, and that which the Locuſt had left, the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerworme
had conſumed:</hi> So that between them all
they had deſtroyed the fruits of the earth, and a
heavie famine was fallen upon the whole land
of Iudah.</p>
            <p>I am not ignorant that ſome of the Fathers
would have theſe words to be meant <hi>tropically,</hi>
and not <hi>literally:</hi> Saint Ierome by thoſe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
underſtands the enemies that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God did ſend
to overthrow them: ſome write, that by the
<hi>Palmerworme</hi> is meant Theglaphalaſar; by the
<hi>Locuſt,</hi> Salmanazar; by the <hi>Cankerworme,</hi> Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherib;
and by the <hi>Caterpillar,</hi> Nebuchadona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer,
who laſt of all took the Nation captive; but
I rather, with Theodoret, take theſe words to be
meant literally, though in the next words of the
Text, we read of a Nation comming into the
land, mighty and ſtrong. It is uſual with the holy
Ghoſt to ſtile them by that name of <hi>people,</hi> or <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
Solomon deſcribes the Ants to be <hi>a people
not ſtrong;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 30. 25. 26.</note> the Conies to be <hi>feeble folke,</hi> the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſts
<hi>to have no king, and yet to goe forth by bands:</hi>
and ſo here we ſee, though theſe creatures have
no king, yet God marſhalls them all in order, to
bring a famine upon Iudah: one yeare he ſent an
army of Palmerwormes; another, of Locuſts;
a third, of Cankerwormes; a fourth, of Cater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillars;
and theſe for foure yeares together de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:25329:5"/>
the vines and fruites of the earth, and
for ſo long brought an heavy dearth upon the
whole land. Now the Prophet, ſeeing this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie
judgement of famine to have fallen upon the
land, he labours to awaken all by true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
as that is the fitteſt time to moove to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment
of life, when Gods judgements are
upon the earth; for then if the inhabitants there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
will not learne righteouſneſſe, they never will.
And as the Prophet awakens all to repentance, ſo
he giveth the firſt on ſet upon Drunkards, and
that not without cauſe; for as they had the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
hand in pulling downe Gods wrath and
vengeance upon the whole land, ſo there was
good reaſon that they ſhould be the forwardeſt
in reverſing that judgement that was out againſt
them, by ſpeedy and unfained repentance. So
that theſe words are an <hi>Alarum</hi> to awaken Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards;
or we may ſtile them, an <hi>Hand-writing</hi>
to hang upon the wall of every Belſhazzar; the
ſight whereof may ſtrike horrour and amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
into them, may trouble their thoughts and
change their countenances; for here is MENE,
MENE, TEKEL, VPHARSIN, thou art weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
ô Belſhazzar, in the ballance; thou art found
too light; thy kingdome, to wit, thy wine, in
which thou doſt ſo much triumph and glory, is
taken from thee, and is divided amongſt the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſts
and the Caterpillars.</p>
            <p>In the words we have two parts;
<list>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:25329:6"/>
                  <item>1. <hi>An Exhortation,</hi> Awake ye drunkards,
and weep and houle all ye drinkers of
wine.</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>A Reaſon of the ſame in theſe words,</hi>
For the new wine ſhall be taken from your
mouthes.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>1. In the Exhortation two things;
<list>
                  <item>1. <hi>The perſons exhorted,</hi> Drunkards, and
drinkers of wine.</item>
                  <item>2. The duty unto which
they are exhorted; and
that is two-fold;
<list>
                        <item>1. <hi>To</hi> Awake.</item>
                        <item>2. <hi>To</hi> Weep <hi>or</hi> houle.</item>
                     </list>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, of the perſons that are awakened; and
they are <hi>Drunkards, and drinkers of wine.</hi> I will
notſtand curiouſly to define Drunkenneſſe, nor
to ſhew the divers kindes of Drunkards; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinkes
the Prophet here lets us underſtand
whom he meanes to be drunkards, when he ſtiles
them <hi>Drinkers of wine:</hi> we muſt firſt of all then
enquire who theſe wine-drinkers are.</p>
            <p>Now, to drinke wine is not unlawfull; for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
creature is good, if it be received with
thankeſgiving; and wine moderately taken, ſaith
Solomon, <hi>makes glad the heart,</hi> and therefore he
would have it given to them that were of heavy
hearts; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>It is not
the uſe of wine, but the abuſe that is forbidden,</hi> as
Chryſoſtome obſerves: for there was drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
before the vertue of the grape was knowne
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:25329:6"/>
to Noah;<note place="margin">Gen. 9.</note> and ſurely, if to drinke wine had been
unlawfull, our Saviour would never have turned
water into wine at the marriage Feaſt; eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
he would never have inſtituted it as a memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall
of his Blood-ſhedding: So that the Prophet
doth not mean to call them drunkards, or drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of wine, that drinke either for hilarity, or
refreſhment of their ſpirits, much leſſe for neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
but ſuch as drinke intemperately: ſo Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret
obſerves upon this place, <hi>Vinum bibere non
eſt malum, ſed intemperanter bibere eſt pernicioſum,</hi>
To drinke wine is no evill at all, but to drinke
inordinately is a mortall crime.</p>
            <p>Now this immoderate drinking is ſeen in
three things;</p>
            <p>Firſt, when the affection is ſet too much upon
the wine,<note place="margin">Prov. 23. 31</note> therefore Solomon exhorts, <hi>Not to
look upon the wine when it giveth his colour in the
glaſſe;</hi> his meaning is, we ſhould not luſt vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently
after it:<note place="margin">1. Tim. 3. 3.</note> So Paul would not have a <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
to be given to much wine;</hi> that is, not to ſet
his affection inordinately upon the ſame.</p>
            <p>Secondly, they may be ſaid to be Drinkers of
wine that ſit too long over their cups, that in the
Tavernes or Alehouſes drinke up too much of
their time, <hi>Qui pitiſſando totum conſumunt diem,</hi>
that in whiſling and ſipping ſpend whole daies:
Though their braines be not intoxicated, yet are
they ſaid to be Drinkers;<note place="margin">Eſay 5. 11.</note> 
               <hi>Woe be to thoſe that riſe
early in the morning that they may follow ſtrong
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:25329:7"/>
drinke, that continue untill night, till the wine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame
them:</hi> And who knoweth not that we have
as much liberty to waſt our vitall ſpirits, as our
pretious time?</p>
            <p>3. Laſt of all, they are drinkers of wine,
<hi>Qui menſuram excedunt,</hi> that drinke meaſure af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
meaſure without all meaſure: <hi>Be not drunke
with wine</hi> (ſaith S. Paul) <hi>wherein is exceſſe;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Epheſ. 5. 18.</note> his
meaning is, that we ſhould not drinke exceſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
more then Nature requires, either for neceſſity
or refreſhment.</p>
            <p>And thus we have heard briefly whom the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
meanes to be Drunkards, or Drinkers of
wine; ſuch as are given to much wine, that waſte
their time or exhauſt their eſtate, waſh away
their braines and ſpirits by pouring in wine and
ſtrong drinke.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> We now come to the duty unto which they
are exhorted; and that is two-fold;
<list>
                  <item>1. <hi>To</hi> Awake.</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>To</hi> Weep and houle.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>1. They muſt <hi>Awake.</hi> It is the nature of
drunkenneſſe to caſt men into a ſleep, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
as Baſil ſaith,<note place="margin">Paſil <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> The whole life of theſe
men is nothing els but a continuall ſleep. And
well may drunkenneſſe be compared to a ſleep in
two reſpects;</p>
            <p>Firſt of all, As ſleep is cauſed by multitude of
vapours which aſcend up into the braine, and ſo
ſtop the paſſage of the ſpirits; ſo drunkenneſſe
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:25329:7"/>
is cauſed by many fumes, which comming into
the braine doe ſtupifie the ſame, and hinder all
the operations of the immortall ſoule.</p>
            <p>2. But eſpecially it may be compared to
ſleep in this regard, that like as ſleepe doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
a man of the uſe of ſenſe and reaſon, ſo
doth this vice.</p>
            <p>Firſt, ſleep doth deprive a man of the uſe of
ſenſe; for as the Philoſopher defineth ſleep, it is
nothing elſe but <hi>Ligatio ſenſuum,</hi> a binding of
all the ſenſes to their good behaviour; ſo drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe
robs a man of common ſenſe, and
makes him worſe then the bruit beaſt, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
like the Idols that David ſpeakes of, that
<hi>have eies and ſee not,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 115. 6. 7</note> 
               <hi>that have eares and heare not,
hands and feel not, feet alſo that are not able
to goe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, as in ſleep we have no uſe of reaſon,
no more have they that are overtaken with this
vice: when men are aſleepe (ſaith the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher)
they differ little from beaſts; and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
is, becauſe the uſe of reaſon is ſuſpended: I
am ſure, thoſe that by evill company have rockt
themſelves aſleep in this ſinne, are not at all to
be diſtinguiſhed from the ſenſitive creatures, but
rather to be reputed in the number of them;
nay, they come ſhort of them; for they have
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> they have ſome reſemblance of reaſon,
to wit, the excellencie of common ſenſe, which
hath ſome correſpondency with humane diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:25329:8"/>
but theſe ſwine have not ſo much as a
glimpſe of underſtanding in them; for (as Saint
Baſil excellently) <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,<note place="margin">Baſil <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note>
as water quencheth
fire, ſo immoderate drinking extinguiſheth the
celeſtiall fire of reaſon, which God from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
hath kindled in us. All men pitty the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorne
eſtate of Nebuchadnezzar, who was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of his underſtanding, and cauſed to live
amongſt the Oxen, and beaſts of the field: And
is not the caſe of every Belſhazzar more to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented,
who wilfully looſe their underſtanding,
and live amongſt beaſts? For excellently doth
Chryſoſtome call Drunkenneſſe <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
it is a voluntary madneſſe,
and a traytour to all reaſon, and betrayeth the
ſuccour of the immortall ſoule: Sobrietie makes
a man able to guard himſelfe againſt his ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
enemies, but Intemperancie doth give up the
minde to be captivated by them.</p>
            <p>Thus we have heard that Drunkenneſſe caſts
men into a ſleep, which takes away all uſe of
ſenſe and reaſon: But is there no meanes to
awaken men out of this ſleep? Yes, Gods Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
muſt call upon them. The Prophet me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinkes
here lifts up his voice like a trumpet, and
labours to rouze them; and our tongues muſt
cleave to the roofe of our mouthes before we
leave calling upon them. It is ſure that this ſleep
is ſo pleaſant to them, that they are loath to be
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:25329:8"/>
hindred of it; they cry, <hi>A little more ſleep, and a
little more ſlumber,</hi> and willingly they would not
be diſturbed; as we reade of the Sybarites, that
they killed all their cocks, leaſt by their crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they ſhould be awakened. But the Prophet
calls upon them to awaken: And what is it to
awaken? It is a metaphor taken from the body,
and tranſlated to the ſoule; that look as men
when they awake out of bodily ſleep, they are
not the ſame men that they were before, having
the uſe of all the powers of ſoule and body; ſo
theſe men muſt change their mindes and become
ſober. The Scripture doth often call upon them
to awaken; S. Paul having to doe with drunken
Epicures, who cried, <hi>Let us eate and drinke,
for to morrow we ſhall die;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 15. 32</note> No, ſaith he, <hi>rather
awaken unto righteouſneſſe.</hi> And good reaſon
why all ſhould awake and repent of this vice, if
we conſider either the time wherein we live, or
the danger that this vice expoſeth us unto.</p>
            <p>Firſt, if we remember the time wherein we
live, and that is in the noone-day of the Goſpell,
wherein it is a ſhame to be found aſleep in this
vice:<note place="margin">Rom. 13. 12.</note> 
               <hi>The night is paſt</hi> (ſaith Saint Paul) <hi>and the
day is at hand, let us not walk in chambering and
wantonneſſe, in ſurfetting and drunkenneſſe:</hi> and
ſo he exhorts the Theſſalonians to ſobriety by
this argument,<note place="margin">1. Theſ. 5. 7.</note> 
               <hi>They that are drunke are drunke
in the night, and they that ſleep ſleep in the night;
but we are not of the night but of the day; let us
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:25329:9"/>
therefore be ſober and watch,</hi> 1. Theſſ. 5. 7. <hi>It is not
for kings to drink wine, nor for princes ſtrong drink,</hi>
ſaith Solomon, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31. 4. I am ſure it is not
for Chriſtians to have fellowſhip with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfull
workes of darkneſſe: it was enough for
the heathen, who lived in Egyptian darkneſſe,
to fall aſleep in this vice; for us, upon whom the
Sunne of righteouſneſſe ſhineth moſt brightly,
ſo much as to ſlumber in this ſinne, is extreame
ſhame.</p>
            <p>The night of ignorance God regarded not,
but now in the day of the Goſpell he lookes that
all ſhould awake; therefore (as Saint Auguſtin ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently)
<hi>Quum,</hi>
               <note place="margin">De ebrieta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te vitanda.</note> 
               <hi>Deo propitio, diſſimiles ſimus illis

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ll<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> in ebrietate penitus non debemus,</hi>
When by Gods mercy we are unlike unto them
in our moſt holy faith, let us not be like unto
them in the imitation of their manners, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
of their beaſtly drunkenneſſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the danger that we are in while we
ſleepe in this vice, may rouze us; for all the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of our ſalvation are ready to ſeize upon us,
eſpecially the Divell watcheth to catch us aſleep
in this vice; ſo Saint Peter tells us, <hi>Be ſober and
watch,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Pet. 5. 8.</note> 
               <hi>for your adverſary the Divell goeth about
like a roaring lyon, ſeeking whom he may devoure;</hi>
and thoſe that he findes aſleep in this vice are a
ſure prey unto him: ſo the Fleſh and the World
will be ſure to get the victory of us, if we awake
not out of this vice. Ariſtotle relates of the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:25329:9"/>
Carthaginians,<note place="margin">Oeconom.</note> that they often got the victory
of their enemies;<note place="margin">libro 1.</note> and he giveth the reaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they abſtained from wine alwaies when
they were to fight: I am ſure, if we would get
the day either of ſpirituall or temporall enemies,
we muſt not ſuffer the wine to rock us aſleep:
therefore as Samſon,<note place="margin">Iudg. 16. 9. 20.</note> when they told him <hi>The
Philiſtins be upon thee, Samſon,</hi> preſently
awoke; ſo when we heare that all our enemies
are ready to ſurprize us, we cannot but awake.
Yet for all the light of the Goſpell ſhineth ſo
brightly upon our faces, for all the great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
that we are in, ſome will not be perſwaded
to awake; but they ſleep ſecurely, though ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
deſolation be ready to come upon them.
We reade of Ionah, that he was faſt aſleep in the
ſhip, when as it was like to be drowned: ſo in
theſe times wherin the ſhip of the Church is like
to be ſunk with the waves of perſecution, yet
ſome revell and carouſe as much as ever, and
like Smiths dogs they lye faſt aſleep in this vice,
when the ſparckels of Gods judgements are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to flie about their eares. In the old world when
men burnt with luſt, God ſent a floud to quench
the fire of their concupiſcence; now he ſends the
fire of his indignatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to conſume the liquor wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
many have drowned themſelves; and yet
few will be warned to eſcape the wrath of God.
Our Saviour tells us, that <hi>as it was in the daies
of Noah, ſo it ſhall be in the latter daies;</hi> now in
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:25329:10"/>
Noahs time, <hi>they gave themſelves to eating and
drinking till the deluge came and ſwept them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way;</hi>
Would to God we did not live to ſee this
verified! doe not men give themſelves to this ſin
of Sodom, and put farre from them the evill day?
God hath awakened the Germans by the ſword
that he hath ſent amongſt them, and he threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
to doe the like to us; but let the cleare light
of the Goſpel moove us to repentance, then ſhall
not God be forced to awake us by his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
And the beſt had need to be carefull to
keep themſelves awake, or els this ſleep will ſeize
upon them: Noah a Preacher of righteouſneſſe, a
while ſlumbered in this vice; Vriah, that religious
and valiant Captaine, was once at a Kings feaſt
overcome by this; and holy Iob was afraid leaſt
his ſons in their feaſts &amp; merry meetings ſhould
fall into this dangerous ſleep: yea if the very beſt
were not ſometime obnoxious to it, our Saviour
would never have given a caution to his diſciples
to avoid this; <hi>Take heed</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>leaſt at any
time your hearts be overtaken with ſurfetting and
drunkenneſſe.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 21. 34.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Now that we may all awake out of this ſleep,
we muſt firſt of all labour for Gods grace, that
may diſpell thoſe luſts which cauſe this ſleep;
for till ſuch time we cannot awake; as we awake
not out of naturall ſleep till the vapours which
cauſe the ſame be diſperſed by the naturall heat:
no more can we repent of this, till Gods grace
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:25329:10"/>
diſpell thoſe inordinate affections which cauſe
the ſame: Therefore Saint Paul exhorts the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſians
<hi>not to be drunke with wine wherein is
exceſſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Epheſ. 5. 18.</note> 
               <hi>but to be filled with the Spirit;</hi> as if the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
had ſaid, If ye will abundantly thirſt after
the water of life, and drinke your fill of the wine
that commeth out of Chriſts cellar, it will
be a ſoveraigne meanes to keep you from exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
drinking of the fruite of the grape. It is a
rule in Philoſophy, that <hi>intus exiſtens prohibet
extraneum,</hi> that which is within will be a means
to keep out that which is without; as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample;
If a veſſell be full of liquor, the aire can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
get in; ſo if our hearts be repleniſhed with
Gods grace, it will keep out thence an inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
deſire of wine.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If we would awake out of this vice
we muſt take heed of all thoſe things that may
rock us aſleep therein; eſpecially of evill compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny:
for that is a Dalilah to lull us aſleep till
our haire be cut, I meane our wits, underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and memory and all be taken from us. <hi>Be
not amongst the wine bibbers,</hi> ſaith the wiſeman;
it is dangerous being with them, leaſt by their
inchauntments this ſleep ſeize upon us. Thus
through Gods grace and our care in refraining
evill company we may keep our ſelves awake.</p>
            <p>This is not all that the Prophet requires of
drinkers of wine; as they muſt <hi>awake,</hi> ſo alſo <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               <hi>weep and howle;</hi> not onely <hi>weep,</hi> but <hi>howle</hi> alſo;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:25329:11"/>
which ſetteth forth unto us the greatnes of the
humiliation which is required of all thoſe that
are guilty of this vice; their mourning muſt be
like the lamentation of Hadadrimmon in the
valley of Megiddon, or like the mourning of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
for their onely ſonne. But theſe men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
endure to heare of any ſorrow at all, much
leſſe of ſo great lamentation: If the Prophet had
called them to mirth and jollity, they would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
have hearkened; but the voice of ſorrow is
alwaies unpleaſing to their cares. But yet we ſee
the holy Ghoſt writes bitter things againſt them,
and would have them turne their <hi>laughter</hi> into
<hi>mourning,</hi> and their <hi>joy</hi> into <hi>heavineſſe.</hi> And good
reaſon why theſe men ſhould weep and mourn,
if they conſider either the nature of the vice
whereof they are guilty, or the labyrinth of woe
and miſery that they plunge themſelves into.</p>
            <p>1. If they conſider the uglines of the vice which
they have committed; which is ſo beaſtly, ſo abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable,
that if a man had a fountaine of teares he
might ſhed them all for this. This is that which
raſeth the image of God out of us and transform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
us into the image of bruite beaſts; this is the
fountaine of all vice, the fewell of luſt, the mother
of whoredoms, rapes, murthers, and all manner
of abominations. It were eaſy, long to declaime
againſt this, and to ſhew the curſed effects thereof
out of the Scriptures, Fathers, Schoolmen, yea
out of the Heathen themſelves, who by the light
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:25329:11"/>
of Nature could learne to abhor this vice. I might
alſo ſet before your eyes ſundry examples of
thoſe, that when they have been in their drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
fits, have commited ſuch outrages, that the
very cogitation thereof may extract teares from
our eyes: onely give me leave to relate unto you
one example,<note place="margin">Ad fratres in Eremo.</note> which Saint Auguſtine maketh
mention of in the city of Hippo where he was
Biſhop, to wit, of one Cyrillus a man of great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
and honour in the city, who having but
one ſonne, through too much indulgence ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
him to runne into exceſſe of riot; and
it happened, that he comming home upon a
time in his drunken fitt, <hi>Patrem, quem poſt Deum
revereri debuiſſet, occidit; matrem, à qua portaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,
praegnantem oppreſſit; ſororem violare voluit;
&amp; duas ſorores vulneravit ad mortem,</hi> He ſlew
his father, whom next to God he ought to have
reverenced; he offered moſt ſavage &amp; unnaturall
violence to his mother, that brought him into the
world, he ſlew two of his ſiſters, and would have
raviſhed a third. I need ſay noe more: The
ſtraunge and prodigious effects of this vice may
make us both to <hi>weep</hi> and <hi>houle</hi> for the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of it.</p>
            <p>But yet this is not all; there is a further cauſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
of mourning for drinkers of wine, if they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
the woe and miſery that this vice will bring
upon them. <hi>To whome is woe? to whome is ſorrow?</hi>
ſaith Solomon. <hi>Even to them that ſit long at
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:25329:12"/>
the wine:</hi> and the Prophet Eſay denounceth woe
againſt them; <hi>Woe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to the drunkards
of Ephraim:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eſay 28 1.</note> Woe and miſery they ſhall have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
in <hi>this world,</hi> and in the <hi>world to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> In this world, povertie, ſhame, and ſicknes
ſhall befall them.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>For</hi> povertie, <hi>that</hi> ſhall come upon them like
an armed man;<note place="margin">Prov. 21. 17</note> He that loveth wine, <hi>ſaith Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
ſhall not be rich.</p>
            <p>2. But be it, that ſome have an eye to the main
chance (for proverbs hold but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, for

then others, yet <hi>ſhame</hi> (which alwaies
followeth ſinne as the ſhadow doth the body)
will overtake them in the ende. Righteous
Noah falling but once into this vice, and (as
many think) through ignorance, hath brought
an eternall blot upon himſelfe, who in one diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper
diſcovered that nakedneſſe which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
hundred yeares had been kept cloſe; And
how doe many often expoſe themſelves, by their
reeling and ſtaggering, to the deriſion of boyes
and children, and are to them as owles are to

            <p>3. <hi>Sicknes,</hi> that is a concomitant of this vice;
It is an excellent ſaying of Chryſoſtome, <gap reason="foreign">

theſe may well weep for the miſery that ſhall

goods, and good name.</p>
            <p>But their greateſt miſery is in the <hi>world to

might dye like beaſts, as they live; but they
muſt know that they muſt come to judgement,

               <hi>ſhall of the fleſh reape

Idolaters, nor drunkards ſhall inherit the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of God;</hi> no, but rather muſt be caſt out into
that lake which burneth with fire and brimſtone,
where is weeping and howling and gnaſhing of
teeth for ever. How much better is it then to
weep now for a moment, then to incurre eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
lamentation for the neglect thereof? Let
them then that are mighty to poure in ſtrong
drinke, poure out ſtrong lamentations for the
miſery that ſhall come upon them, if they doe
not prevent the ſame by ſpeedy and unfained
repentance. But ſome there are that in ſtead
of mourning for this vice, make a ſport of it,
and count it but a trick of good fellowſhip,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:25329:13"/>
and ſo like the Leviathan they can laugh at the
glittering ſword and ſpeare, when it is ready
to pierce them through. I know <hi>there is a time
to laugh, and a time to mourne;</hi> but wee can
finde no time to lament this ſinne, which hath
kindled Gods wrath againſt his people. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſinnes cry aloud againſt us for vengeance,
but none pierce the heavens more then this
beaſtly, though common ſinne of drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;
and yet it is to be feared, that not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

the Angell of the Lord ſhould runne to and
fro, and ſet a marke upon all thoſe that
mourne for this, how many of us would he
paſſe by, who will not let fall a teare to quench
the indignation of God, which is moſt juſtly
kindled againſt us for this and other abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions!
May not the Lord complaine of us as
he did of his people the Iewes, that he <hi>called
them to weeping and mourning &amp; to girding
with ſackcloth; and behold joy and gladnes, eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fleſh and drinking wine,</hi> and that not in
<hi>Timothies cup</hi> onely, but in <hi>Belſhazzars bowles</hi>
alſo? The Prophet Amos ſaw to his griefe,
that in his time they dranke wine in bowles,
and forgate the afflictions of Ioſeph: it were
to be deſired that we could not ſee the ſame
in theſe times, wherein the Church hangs her
Harps upon the willowes, while ſhe ſits by the
waters of Babylon. But methinks I heare
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:25329:13"/>
ſome confeſſe that indeed they are ſometimes
overtaken with this vice, but they are ſorry
for it. If it be ſo, it will eaſily appeare by
their amendment of life: For ſorrow beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
hatred, and hatred begetteth a ſequeſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from it; ſo that I may ſay to ſuch, as Saint
Paul doth to the Corinthians in another caſe,
<hi>If they have ſorrowed after a godly manner for
this,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 7. 11.</note> What <hi>care</hi> hath it wrought in them to
avoid the occaſions of this vice? what <hi>apologies</hi>
to acquit themſelves, when they are in danger
to be drawne into this vice? what <hi>deſire</hi> to
eſcape this in all places and at all times? what
<hi>feare</hi> leaſt by evill company they be overcome?
what <hi>zeale</hi> will they have againſt this vice in the
places where they live? what <hi>indignation</hi> will
they have againſt themſelves, that they ſhould
be guilty of ſuch a vice? yea, what <hi>revenge</hi>
will they take of themſelves by faſting and
humiliation for the ſame? Where none of
theſe effects are, there can hardly be any ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
for this ſinne: let none therefore daub
with untempered mortar; for God is not
mocked: where there is no <hi>reformation</hi> of this
vice, there is no <hi>lamentation</hi> for it; and where
there is no <hi>mourning</hi> for this, there is no <hi>awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
out of it.</p>
            <p>AND theſe men had need to awake, and weep,
&amp; howle, if they conſider what followeth in the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:25329:14"/>
Text, <hi>The newe wine ſhall be taken from them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
If any thing will moove them, it will be this, that
otherwiſe they ſhall be bereft of that, wherein
they place their chiefe felicity; and that not
by potent adverſaries, ſuch as were <hi>Salmana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar,</hi>
and <hi>Nebuchadonazar;</hi> but by <hi>locuſts, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerwormes,</hi>
and <hi>caterpillers;</hi> This I ſay (if any
thing) muſt needs go to the heart of them,
to have their new wine rent from their mouthes
by ſuch contemptible creatures. The Prophet
ſpecifieth but one kinde of wine, to wit, that
which commeth out of the preſſe; and ſo the
word <hi>[gnaſim]</hi> in the originall doth ſignifie
<hi>muſtum,</hi> that which is new preſt: but yet he
meaneth all kindes of wine ſhould be ſnatched
away by violence; for ſo the word in the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall
intimates unto us, That albeit they
were unwilling to let goe their cups, yet, will
they nill they, they ſhould be plucked from
their mouthes. And here we ſee, if we come
once to abuſe Gods creatures to luxury and
intemperancy, he hath many waies to deprive
us of them; not onely by ſending armies of
men, but by ſending out a few caterpillers.
But eſpecially we may take notice how this
vice of drunkennes pulleth downe Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
upon the whole land:<note place="margin">Ier. 23. 10.</note> 
               <hi>For oathes the
land mourneth,</hi> ſaith the Prophet Ieremy: ſo
it doth for drunkennes; for we may reade in
the tenth verſe of this Chapter, that for this
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:25329:14"/>
ſinne <hi>the whole land of Iudah mourned; becauſe the
corne was waſted, the new wine was dryed up,
and the oyle languiſhed.</hi> Many and ſundry are
the calamities that befall a Nation for this vice;
this was that which cauſed the Lord to give up
his owne people into the hands of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies:
So the Prophet Eſay;<note place="margin">Eſay 5. 11. 12.</note> 
               <hi>Woe be to thoſe that
riſe early in the morning that they may follow
ſtrong drinke, that continue untill night, till wine
inflame them, and the harp and the violl, the
tabret and pipe and wine are in their feaſts;
but they regard not the worke of the Lord, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
conſider the operation of his hands: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
are my people gone into Captivitie.</hi> And
not to goe any further then the Text, The
Lord threatneth to deſtroy the vines and all
the fruites of the earth for this ſinne; may
not we then feare that for the abuſe of wine,
we ſhall not onely have our wines, but our
wives, children, and goods taken from us? The
<hi>Spaniſh Caterpillers</hi> and the <hi>Ieſuiticall locuſts</hi>
have devoured the <hi>vines</hi> of our brethren in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many:</hi>
I dare not ſay it was for drunkennes;
but this might be one meanes to kindle Gods
wrath againſt them; And ſhall we thinke, if
we be drinkers of wine, that we ſhall alwaies
eſcape? No, the Locuſts and Caterpillers crawle
as faſt as they can upon us; let us then awake
and gird up the loynes of our mindes and be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and it may be we ſhall ſee the ſalvation of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:25329:15"/>
the Lord, and that in his due time, he will
ſend a winde that ſhall ſcatter theſe locuſts and
drive them into the Sea of perdition. Howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
<hi>Ne nos invadant ſomno vinóque ſepultos,</hi>
let them not, if they come, finds us faſt aſleep
in this vice; If they doe, they will not onely
take our wines from us, but us from our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and make us ſlaves to them, and, which is
worſt of all, captivate our ſoules to their Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh
ſuperſtition. If therfore there be any feare
of God in us, any love to the Goſpell, any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity
in us, any ſparkle of religion; let us
awake out of this ſinne, and it may be God will
awake, and ſtirre up himſelfe, and come forth
for our ſalvation: which we humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
him to doe, for the merits of our
LORD and bleſſed SAVIOVR; to whom
with the FATHER and the holy
SPIRIT be all honour and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
now and for ever.</p>
