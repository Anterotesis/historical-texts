         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>May it therefore pleaſe the iudicious and learned Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to weigh the Scriptures following: which proſeſſedly, and of purpoſe, ſpeake of theſe things. Some in plaine and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:2242:5"/>
euident termes, other more obſcurely, but all layd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, caſt ſuch a light, as leaue this doctrine without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But before we enter vpon the particular Texts, take ſome few rules, for the better vnderſtanding of the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies of this kinde: Aſwell touching the threatned deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as for the conuerſion of this people, and the enemy that ſhall fall before them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The deſolation ſpoken of, <hi>Cities without inhabitant, houſes without men, the land deſolate,</hi> Eſay 6. 11. <hi>The moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, hils, riuers, valleyes, waſte.</hi> Ezech. 36. 4. <hi>No King, no Prince,</hi> no forme, or face of Church, or Common-wealth, good or bad, and that <hi>for many dayes,</hi> Hoſh. 3. 4. Were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer before, but now are truely verified in the height of them, ſome 1600 yeeres together, ſince they reiected Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Though the Prophets, when they handle theſe things, thunder againſt the ſins of their owne age, that is, but to note the Iuſtice of the future deſolation: for God is righteous to puniſh in the children, their fore-fathers faults, when they walke in the ſame ſteps of diſobedience, <hi>Eſay</hi> 14. 21. Touching their conuerſion.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Where <hi>Iſrael, Iudah, Tſion, Ieruſalem,</hi> &amp;c. are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in this argument, the Holy Ghoſt meaneth not the ſpirituall Iſrael, or Church of God collected of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, no nor of the Iewes and Gentiles both (for each of theſe haue their promiſes ſeuerally and apart) but Iſrael properly deſcended out of <hi>Iacobs</hi> loynes.</p>
                  <p>The ſame iudgement is to bee made of their returning to their land and ancient ſeates, the conqueſt of their foes, the fruitfulnes of their ſoile, the glorious Church they ſhall erect in the land it ſelfe of Iudah, their bearing rule farre and neere. Theſe and ſuch like are not Allegories, ſetting forth in terrene ſimilitudes or deliuerance through Chriſt (whereof thoſe were types and figures) but meant really and literally of the Iewes. It was not poſſible to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe mote expreſſe or euident tearmes, then the Spirit of purpoſe vſeth to cut off all ſuch conſtruction. Neither were
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:2242:5"/>
                     <hi>Ioſias</hi> or <hi>Cyrus</hi> more plainely named hundred of yeares before they were borne, then theſe things are plainely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered for the confirming of that peoples faith. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee need not be afraid to averre and mainteyne, that one day they ſhall come to Ieruſalem againe, be Kings and chiefe Monarches of the earth, ſway and gouerne all, for the glory of Chriſt that ſhall ſhine among them. And that is it <hi>Lactantius</hi> ſaith, <hi>Lib.</hi> 7. <hi>Cap.</hi> 15. <hi>The Romane name (I will ſpeake it, becauſe it muſt one day be) ſhall bee taken from the earth, and the Empire ſhall returne to Aſia, and againe ſhall the Eaſt beare dominion, and the Weſt bee in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Such promiſes of the Goſpell as come in order after that deſolation, or after mercy to be ſhewed to the gentiles, are without queſtion to be referred to theſe times.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Nay, generally all Euangelicall promiſes made vnto them, ſeeing they neither at the firſt receiued the goſpell, nor euer hitherto enioyed that peace, plenty, and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which the promiſes doe purport, cannot but aime at ſomwhat that is yet to come.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The great and glorious things, which in the height and excellency thereof, are ſpoken peculiarly to them, doe in their meaſure and degree, appertaine in common to all the faithfull. And ſo in the new Teſtament, are ordinarily applyed: Whereof ſee more in this treatiſe following vpon <hi>Eſay,</hi> 54.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Their conuerſion vnto Chriſt in the laſt dayes, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly is intimated by turning from Idolatrie. Which howſoeuer the Iewes be not now infected with, (if you ſpeake of bowing to ſtockes and ſtones) was then the maine ſinne of the times. And taketh vs forth this worthy leſſon that it is meere Idolatrie, and a worſhip of falſe Gods, whatſoeuer worſhip looketh not to God in Chriſt, which <hi>Iohn</hi> alſo teacheth. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 20. 21. When hauing laide down the doctrin, that Ieſus Chriſt is the true God, and life euerlaſting, immediately he addeth, <hi>Little children keepe your ſelues from Idols.</hi> This rule for the expoſition of the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:2242:6"/>
Prophets, I learne of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 27. vouching <hi>Eſay</hi> 27. 9. (which ſpeaketh of their caſting away of Idols) as a principall place to warrant the calling of the Iewes.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Albeit the thorow comming in of the Gentiles, for all nations with one conſent to receiue Chriſt, be put off to the Iewes conuerſion, yet that nothing hindreth but the places that ſpeake of the ſame, may well ſerue to warrant the firſt inceptions of their calling. And ſo doth <hi>Iames</hi> cite them. <hi>Act.</hi> 15, 16, 17. out of <hi>Amos cap.</hi> 9. 11, 12. and <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 9. 25, 26. out of <hi>Hoſea Chap.</hi> 1. 10.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The conuerſion of the Gentiles, is many times inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by the Iſraelites maiſtring of them, poſſeſſing them for ſeruants, and for handmaides as <hi>Eſay,</hi> 14. 2. <hi>Amos</hi> 9. 12. <hi>Obadiah, verſ.</hi> 19. Which is not meant ſo much of a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall ſubduing, as of a ſpirituall ioyning with them, in ſeeking of the Lord; yet ſo as the chiefe ſoueraigntie and ſtroke of keeping men within the liſts of their ſubiection and obedience vnto Chriſt, ſhall remaine among the Iewes. And ſo <hi>Iames</hi> teacheth vs to expound thoſe phraſes, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 17. Where that which <hi>Amos</hi> ſaith, <hi>that they (the Iſraelites) may poſſeſſe the remnant of Edom, Iames</hi> rendreth, <hi>that the reſidue of men may ſeeke after the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The enemy whom indeed they ſhall conquer, roote out, and deſtroy, after they haue groaned long vnder his hard yoke and bondage, is not alwaies repreſented by one and the ſame name.

                     <p>THe 40<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter propoundeth comfort thorough the promiſes of God in Chriſt to his people the Iewes, after thoſe long and tedious calamities which they had endured in the Babylonian captiuitie, and the hard times that followed after. <hi>(verſ.</hi> 1, 2.)</p>
                     <p>The parts of it are,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The miniſterie of <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> a Cryar to prepare his way. <hi>(verſ.</hi> 3, 4, 5.)</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Apoſtolicall miniſterie of all the Preachers of the Goſpell, teaching repentance <hi>(verſ.</hi> 6, 7, 8.) and faith in Chriſt. <hi>(verſ.</hi> 9.)</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The generall adminiſtration of Chriſts kingdome, ſubduing rebels, <hi>(verſ.</hi> 10.) and moſt kindly entreating his. <hi>(verſ.</hi> 11.)</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Euangelicall promiſes particular to the ſeede of <hi>Iacob,</hi> which becauſe they are of a high and marueylous nature, firſt he layeth the ground of them, by the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the nature of God the Creator. <hi>(verſ.</hi> 12. <hi>to the end of the Chap.)</hi> and of his ſpeciall fauours to <hi>Abraham</hi> and all the Church. <hi>(Chap.</hi> 41. <hi>to the</hi> 15. <hi>verſ.)</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, he commeth to the promiſes themſelues, being of two ſorts.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The power of God in their weakneſſe to throw downe all that ſhall oppoſe. <hi>(verſ.</hi> 15, 16.) <note place="margin">18 Poſit. <hi>Conqueſt.</hi>

                     <p>Thirdly, he amplifieth and confirmeth the ſame by three arguments.</p>
                     <p>One is by oppoſing to Idols that are able to do nothing <hi>(verſ.</hi> 21, 22, 23, 24.) the Church of the Iewes, that making

                     </p>
                     <p>A ſecond argument is by oppoſing to the ſame Idols, Chriſt, the wiſedome of God and the power of God, in whom God alone worketh all that hath beene ſaid, after his owne pleaſure. <hi>(verſ.</hi> 26, 27.)</p>
                     <p>The third argument is by remouing all other meanes whatſoeuer. <hi>(verſ.</hi> 28, 29.)</p>

                        <p>THE worke of God in caſting downe the proud ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants of the world, and thus magnifying the great name of his Sonne Chriſt Ieſus, is ſo great &amp; won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull, that the Prophet, as it were rapt beyond himſelfe, is faine to make a ſtop or breathing before he come to a further illuſtration of it; interlacing both his owne priuate meditations, and the hymne of the whole Church that ſo ſhall be collected.</p>
                        <p>His owne meditation (in the 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter) hath three parts.</p>
                        <p>The firſt concerneth the fall of theſe tyrants, which the Prophet diuinely vttereth in the forme of a thankſgiuing. Wherein rauiſhed with the conſideration of ſo marueilous things, he doth firſt breake forth into praiſes, the praiſes <note place="margin">1.</note> of God, the author of this and all other good things. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning with the ground of all, Gods power,</p>
                        <p>And the couenant with his people,</p>
                        <p>Afterwards he layeth downe the particular things, for the which Gods name is ſo highly to be exalted. And they are,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. His power, ſeene in ſo wonderfull a deliuerie.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. His truth, whoſe counſels and decrees long ago fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told and vttered by his Prophets, are moſt ſteadie and conſtant, and take their due effect.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. His iuſtice in executing iudgement, tumbling downe the enemies of Gods people, notwithſtanding all their <note place="margin">2.</note> might, that they ſhall be vtterly without hope euer to be recouered.</p>
                        <p>Which the very wicked ſhall be driuen to acknowledge. <note place="margin">3.</note> Such is the honour that hereby ſhall redound to his great and holy name, wrung out of the mouth of ſturdie and fierce enemies.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. His mercy in ſuccouring his poore oppreſſed <note place="margin">4.</note> people.</p>

In the firſt, the enemies and oppreſſors of the Church are compared to raging waters that carry all afore them, hurle downe walls and whatſoeuer elſe that ſtandeth in their way: God to a place of refuge to flie vnto.</p>
                        <p>In the other, the inſolencie of theſe ſtrangers, (the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Gods people) the ſtir and ado they make, is reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled <note place="margin">5.</note> to a heat and drought that doth parch and ſcorch the godly; Gods protection of his, to a thicke ſhadow. <hi>Thou</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>bringeſt downe the noyſe of the ſtrangers as heate is ſlaked in a drie and parched ground: as heate</hi> I ſay is ſlaked <hi>with the ſhadow of a thicke cloud. which heate anſwered,</hi> and was a life to the <hi>branches</hi> and ſpreading boughes <hi>of the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.</hi> That is, ſerued well the turne, and was moſt commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious for the wicked, who thinke their branches ſpread and flouriſh when the godly are ſcorched with calamities.</p>

In vvhich
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:2242:78"/>
time the Temple and Citie ſhall be built anew, Chriſt the Lord of the Temple by his perſonall preſence ſhall abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh the legall worſhip, and at the laſt in fact take it quite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, deſtroying both Temple and City by the Romaine Armies, which iuſtly ſhall light vpon their heads for refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the ſaluation which this great Prophet their Lord and redeemer came into the world to bring vnto them.</p>
                  <p>Three queſtions heere naturally ariſe vpon the vnfol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding whereof the vnderſtanding of this Scripture doth much depend: one from what time theſe 70. ſeauens take their beginning: another when they determine and haue an end: the third, who ſhould be the Meſſiah here ſpoken of.

                  <p>There were 3. captiuities of Gods people all mentioned, 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 36. and 2. <hi>Kings</hi> 24. and 25.</p>
                  <p>The firſt towards the end of the third yeare of <hi>Iehoia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kim,</hi> and the beginning of his fourth, being the firſt yeare of <hi>Nabuchadnetſar,</hi> when <hi>Daniel</hi> and his fellowes were led away captiues, <hi>Ier.</hi> 25. 1. <hi>Dan.</hi> 1. 1.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond vnder <hi>Iehoiacin</hi> or <hi>Iechonia</hi> about the eight yeare of <hi>Nabuchadnetzar;</hi> from whence <hi>Ezechiel</hi> is wont to reckon, <hi>Ezekiel.</hi> 1. 2. being himſelfe one of that capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie.</p>
                  <p>The third in the eleuenth of <hi>Zedechia</hi> and ninteenth of <hi>Nabuchadnetſar</hi> when the City &amp; temple were deſtroyed: from which of theſe the 70. yeares captiuity ſhould begin, is a great queſtion. I referre it to the firſt: for,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Ieremy</hi> giueth but 70. yeares to <hi>Babel,</hi> which are firſt ſpoken of when great <hi>Nebuchadnetzar</hi> began his raigne, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 25.

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:2242:78"/>
captiuity, are an apparant proofe that, part of the 70. yeares captiuity was then expired. And thus it may well ſtand that <hi>Haggai</hi> ſaith, in the ſixt yeare of <hi>Darius,</hi> that many there preſent had ſeene the former houſe, <hi>Hag.</hi> 2. 3. for it was deſtroyed not paſt 67. yeares before. Alſo <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> was not to old to wield the Babilonian Empire in the time of <hi>Darius Medus,</hi> it being but the 70. ſeauenth yeare of his captiuity. And <hi>Ezrah</hi> (whoſe father <hi>Seraiah</hi> was ſlaine when the Temple was burnt, 2. <hi>Kings</hi> 25. 21.) might be actiue in the ſeauenth of <hi>Artaxerxes, Ezra</hi> 7. 8. which was 21. yeares after that ſixt yeare of <hi>Darius,</hi> and ſo 88. yeares from the death of his father. All which things, but by this reckoning, could hardly be admitted.</p>
                  <p>He that pulled downe the Babylonian pride, was <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> the Mede. <hi>Cyrus</hi> (as <hi>Zenophon</hi> alſo writeth) was but the Lieutenant of his Armie, and acknowledged him his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne: For,</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Darius</hi> tooke (of his owne authority, not by any mans guift) the Kingdome, as ſoone as <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhazzer</hi> was ſlaine, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. 31.

                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Daniel</hi> reciteth his viſions in order thus, In the firſt yeare of <hi>Belſhazzer, Dan.</hi> 7. 1. In the third yeare of <hi>Belſhazzer, Dan.</hi> 8. 1. In the firſt yeare of <hi>Darius. Dan.</hi> 9. 1. In the third yeare of <hi>Cyrus, Dan.</hi> 10. 1.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Darius</hi> raigne is reckoned as diſtinct from <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> and before <hi>Cyrus, Dan.</hi> 6. 29. He raigned not a yeare (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 62. yeares old when <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> was ſlaine, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. 31.)
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:2242:79"/>
and let <hi>Cyrus</hi> his Succeſſor: for <hi>Daniel</hi> in the firſt of his raigne vnderſtood the 70. yeares to be that yeare accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed. <hi>Dan.</hi> 92. So the Propheſie of <hi>Ieremie</hi> was fulfilled, that the 70. yeares Captiuity, and the Babylonian Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie ſhould end together. <hi>ler.</hi> 25. 12. &amp; 29. 10.</p>
                  <p>But it will be obiected that, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36 20. the captiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty laſteſt till the Kingdome of Perſia came in. Therefore that <hi>Cyrus</hi> raigned together with <hi>Darius;</hi> elſe the Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian Monarchie ſhould not end with the captiuity: for the raigne of <hi>Darius Medus</hi> came betweene.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, <hi>Darius</hi> raigne was a part of the Perſian Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy; for he wrote himſelfe King of the Medes and Perſians: and ſeeing the Perſian name preuailed aboue the Medes, and that inſtantly <hi>(Darius</hi> dying the ſame yeare) <hi>Ezra</hi> calleth the whole ſucceſſion from the time of the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of <hi>Babilon,</hi> the Kingdome of Perſia.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Darius</hi> was the ſonne of <hi>Aſſuerus,</hi> of the ſeede of the Medes, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 1. whom (leauing to euery man his iudgement free) I take to bee that <hi>Aſſuerus</hi> which was Queene Eſters huſband, and that ſhee was not wife, neither to <hi>Darius Hyſtaſpis,</hi> or any other ſucceeding King: for,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, there bee but two <hi>Aſſueruſſes</hi> mentioned in the Scripture: this and another, <hi>Ezra</hi> 4, 6. Succeſtor. vnto <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus.</hi> But he raigned nothing neere 13. yeares, as our <hi>Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erus</hi> did, <hi>Eſter</hi> 3. 7. compared with <hi>Eſter</hi> 9. 1. nor was a friend but a perpetuall enemie to the Iewes. And ſeeing the holy Ghoſt doth ſo preciſely diſtinguiſh the Perſian Kings by their ſeuerall and proper names, which bring great light vnto a Story: I would not confound theſe things to giue two names to one, and the ſame perſon; that in one place he ſhould be called <hi>Darius,</hi> in another <hi>Aſſue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> without apparant euidence and warrant out of the Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the whole courſe of <hi>Eſters</hi> Story ſheweth that it was acted during the captiuity; for it is not credible that after the returne of 49000. vnder <hi>Cyrus. Ezra</hi> 2. there ſhould bee left ſuch a multitude of Iewes, and of that
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:2242:79"/>
ſtrength, as at <hi>Suſis,</hi> were able to kill 800. of their enemies, and in the reſt of <hi>Aſſuerus</hi> Dominions, 75000. <hi>Eſter,</hi> 9. 12. 15. 16. nor would <hi>Mordecai</hi> and Queene <hi>Heſter</hi> after the Temple built againe haue inſtituted the <hi>Purim, Eſter</hi> 9. 31. without ſending to the houſe of God to enquire of the Lord by the mouth of his Prieſts and Prophets, what were to be done as the people did, <hi>Zach.</hi> 7. 2. 3. And in the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that <hi>Mordecai</hi> wrote to all the Iewes which were in the Prouinces of King <hi>Aſſuerus</hi> farre and neere, appointing them to celebrate that day, <hi>Eſter</hi> 9. 20. 21. they in <hi>Iudaea</hi> would by name haue beene ſpoken of, if at that time the people had beene come back?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Aſſuerus Heſters</hi> huſband was King of Media and Perſia; for hee made that great feaſt to the Princes of his Armies of Perſia and Media. <hi>Eſter</hi> 1. 3. and the acts of <hi>Mordecaies</hi> greatneſſe are ſaid to be regiſtred in the <hi>Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles</hi> of the Kings of Media and Perſia, <hi>Eſter</hi> 10. 2. But I finde not after <hi>Cyrus</hi> once came to the helme, that they are at any time in holy Scripture called Kings of Media and Perſia, but of Perſia only<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for being at the firſt a beaſt of two hornes, the Kingdome of Media and Perſia, <hi>Dan.</hi> 8. 20. this latter that roſe vp after, grew higher than the other and tooke the honour from it, <hi>Dan.</hi> 8. 3.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Why doth the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 1 ſpeake of <hi>Aſſuerus</hi> father to <hi>Darius</hi> the Mede, more than of the father of <hi>Cyrus</hi> or any other, but for ſome ſpeciall purpoſe? And that muſt be in regard of the Story of <hi>Eſter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fiftly, <hi>Mordecaies</hi> age doth proue it; his oppoſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Haman,</hi> and the other things he did in the twelfth of <hi>Aſſuerus</hi> cannot be thought to come from ſo old a man as he muſt bee, if you make <hi>Aſſuerus</hi> to be <hi>Darius Hyſtaſpis:</hi> for from the captiuity of <hi>Ieconias</hi> when <hi>Mordecai</hi> was led a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, <hi>Eſter</hi> 2. 6. to the twelfth of <hi>Aſſuerus,</hi> are 83. yeares: and if hee were then but 7. yeares of age, which is not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he muſt now be 90. neither is to be thought that hee would at thoſe yeares begin to enter into the affaires of the State (eſpecially of ſuch a great &amp; turbule<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t State) as he did,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:2242:80"/>
                     <hi>Eſter</hi> 10. <hi>Barzillai</hi> long before being but 80. refuſed a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter offer to be in <hi>Dauids</hi> Court, becauſe of the greatneſſe of his age. 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 19. 33, 34, 35, 36.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Aſſuerus</hi> raigned from <hi>India</hi> to <hi>Ethiopia</hi> as it is commonly tranſlated. But the Hebrew is from <hi>India</hi> to <hi>Cuſh. Cuſh</hi> may bee taken as well for <hi>Arabia</hi> as <hi>Aethiopia;</hi> and to ſome parts of <hi>Arabia</hi> his Kingdome might well reach, euen whilſt the Babilonians bare their greatest ſway: for the Kings which ſhould ſubdue <hi>Babylon,</hi> that is the Medes and Perſians, are called mighty Nations and great Kings, <hi>Ier.</hi> 27. 7.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Herodotus</hi> in his firſt Booke doth wonderfully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll the great power of <hi>Cyaxeres</hi> the Mede (by that name Stories call this <hi>Aſſuerus</hi> and his father) who ruled (as hee ſaith) ouer all <hi>Aſia,</hi> and ſubdued the Aſſyrians, the Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians only excepted: it is like his territories extended to the Indians Eaſtward, and of the other ſide vnto <hi>Arabia</hi> and <hi>Nebuchadnetzars</hi> moſt about <hi>Babylon,</hi> and in <hi>Aegypt, Tyrus</hi> and the regions of <hi>Aſia minor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Howſoeuer it were, if hee enlarged not his bounds ſo farre, whilſt <hi>Nebuchadnetzar</hi> was aliue, at the leaſt he might doe it in the time of <hi>Euilmerodach,</hi> who loſt much to the Medes and Perſians, and was at the laſt ſlaine in battaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them.</p>
                  <p>That which maketh all the doubt is that <hi>Mordecai</hi> was carried priſoner fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> by <hi>Nebuchadnetzar,</hi> King of <hi>Babel</hi> in the captiuity of <hi>Ieconiah, Eſter</hi> 2. 6. Therefore he dwelt not vnder the dominion of <hi>Aſſuerus</hi> the Mede: for from <hi>Nebuchadnetzar</hi> till <hi>Babel</hi> was taken by <hi>Darius,</hi> none of the Medes had footing in that Kingdome. Nay, the Iewes by Gods ordinance were to ſerue the King of <hi>Babel,</hi> his ſonne and ſonnes ſonne till the yeares of the captiuity ſhould be expired, as may bee gathered by <hi>Ier.</hi> 27. 7. 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 36. 20. And a Babylonian King (if it were during the captiuitie) this <hi>Aſſuerus</hi> could not bee; for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Babylon</hi> was promiſed to <hi>Nebuchadnetzar</hi> his ſonne and ſonnes ſonne, <hi>Ier.</hi> 25. 6, 7. who are named
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:2242:80"/>
to bee <hi>Euilmerodach,</hi> 2. <hi>Kings</hi> 25. 27. and <hi>Belſhazzar, Dan.</hi> 5.</p>
                  <p>This indeed is a great obiection, to the which of a certaine I can ſay nothing. But ſeeing <hi>Aſſuerus</hi> was a King of the Medes and Perſians, and euen during the Babiloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an captiuity there was at <hi>Suſis</hi> where <hi>Aſſuerus</hi> kept his court, <hi>Eſter</hi> 1. 2. a Pallace for the Kings of Media and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia: <hi>Dan.</hi> 8. 2. Why may it not be that multitude of the Iewes diſperſed themſelues hither and thither into diuers Countries, as they could beſt make ſhift, eſpecially in the confuſion and ſhuffling of things, when <hi>Nebuchadnet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi> was throwne out of his Kingdome; and <hi>Morde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cai</hi> happily among the reſt might tranſport himſelfe to <hi>Suſis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this City was <hi>Daniel</hi> the third yeare of King <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhazzar, Dan.</hi> 8. 2. for ſo I hold hee was indeed and not in a viſion: he might bee by the riuer Vlai in a viſion: but when he ſaw that viſion he was really in the Pallace at <hi>Suſis.</hi> Belike in regard of his great wiſedome hee was ſent thither vpon ſome Embaſſage or other employment for the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of the King his maiſter: So <hi>verſ.</hi> 27. of that Chapter ſeemeth to import; for certainely at that time <hi>Suſis</hi> was of the Medes dominion.</p>
                  <p>The generality therefore of the people might be vnder the King of <hi>Babel;</hi> for it was the Babylonicall captiuity, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Land of <hi>Iudaea</hi> belonged to the Babylonian, and no returne could be without his leaue) though many of them ſhifted for themſelues elſewhere.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps alſo the King of Medes, either taking aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of thoſe great changes in the ſtate and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth that could not but fall out vpon the expelling of <hi>Nebuchadnetzar,</hi> or in the looſeneſſe of <hi>Euilmerodachs</hi> raigne when his father was dead, ſubdued thoſe places in <hi>Meſopotamia</hi> about the riuer <hi>Chebar,</hi> whether the Iewes of <hi>Ieconias</hi> captiuity were led away, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2. 25. ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other things there bee which might make an alteration, that are not particularly and by name expreſſed in the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:2242:81"/>
Scripture, Wherefore Gods great goodneſſe to his poore afflicted Church did herein maruellouſly ſhew it ſelfe, that at one and the ſametime, vnder the captiuity, in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of their greateſt heauineſſe; <hi>Mordecai</hi> and Queene <hi>Eſter</hi> among the Medes, and <hi>Daniel</hi> with the Babylonians were ſo highly exalted.</p>
                  <p>After <hi>Darius</hi> death came the proclamation of <hi>Cyrus</hi> which is recorded, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36. <hi>&amp; Ezr.</hi> 1. That <hi>Darius</hi> was then dead appeareth by the <hi>Memorandum</hi> found among the records, <hi>Ezra</hi> 6. 2. 3. made in the firſt yeare of K. <hi>Cyrus: Cyrus made a decree, &amp;c.</hi> and by the proclamation it ſelfe. <hi>Thus ſaith Cyrus King of Perſia: God hath giuen vnto mee all the Kingdomes of the Earth, &amp;c.</hi> If <hi>Darius</hi> had been liuing, <hi>Cyrus</hi> would not haue written himſelfe King of <hi>Perſia;</hi> for all <hi>Darius</hi> time it was the Medes and Perſians: At the leaſt he would not haue ſaid, <hi>that God had giuen him all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of the earth,</hi> when <hi>Darius</hi> was his Soueraigne; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would he haue beene named King of <hi>Babel</hi> at that time (as <hi>Ezra</hi> 5. 13. relating therevnto doth call him) which without queſtion was <hi>Darius</hi> his during his life. <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. 31. &amp; 6. 1. 2. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now then for the firſt queſtion (of the three formerly propounded) from this Edict of <hi>Cyrus</hi> (the time when the ſeauenty yeares captiuity ended) begin the ſeauenty ſeauens: for,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Certainely, they include the whole time of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples welfare; ſo the words of the Angell ſound, <hi>Seauenty ſeauens are determined vpon thy people and vppon thy holy Citie:</hi> But that was promiſed to be aſſoon as the ſeauenty yeares captiuity ſhould expire, <hi>Ier.</hi> 29. 10. <hi>After ſeauenty yeares bee accompliſhed to Babel, I will viſite you, and performe my good promiſe, to cauſe you to returne to this place.</hi> The performance of which promiſe <hi>Daniel</hi> heere prayeth, that God would not deferre, <hi>verſe</hi> 19. And the Angell telleth him, <hi>verſ.</hi> 23. hee was heard in that hee prayed for, and that the Angell was come to declare the ſame vnto him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Angell ſpeaketh of the going forth of the word,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:2242:81"/>
as of a thing notorious: which muſt needs be the word or proclamation that was to come from <hi>Cyrus;</hi> for of him the Scripture ſpeaketh by name, <hi>Eſay</hi> 43. 23. and other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe there was not any.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To ſuſpend the beginning ſo long, as till <hi>Darius No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus,</hi> or the ſecond <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> (whom they call <hi>Artax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erxes Muemon)</hi> were to make <hi>Daniel</hi> &amp; the whole Church (for whoſe comfort this Propheſie was reuealed) ignorant of the beginning. And then there ſhould haue needed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother to haue interpreted the Angell, and to ſhew when that Edict was to be publiſhed.</p>
                  <p>It is true, the Edict was not gone forth when <hi>Daniel</hi> vſed this prayer; for his prayer was in the raigne of <hi>Darius</hi> the Mede, at what time <hi>Cyrus</hi> was not as yet the abſolute Lord: But it appeareth, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 1, 2. <hi>Daniel</hi> knew the time was now come when the ſame muſt be accompliſhed, and <hi>Cyrus</hi> notoriouſly knowne to be the perſon that muſt doe it, <hi>Eſay</hi> 43. 23. So that of this Edict preſently to be promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, both himſelfe and the whole Church tooke certaine knowledge: whereſome obiect that the Angell ſpeaketh not of the bringing back of the people, or of the building of the Temple, but to build <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> againe, and therefore that it cannot be meant of <hi>Cyrus</hi> Edict; but muſt bee refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the twentieth of <hi>Artaxerxes Mnemon,</hi> when <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie</hi> receiued commiſſion from him to build the Citie of the ſepulchres of his fathers, that is to ſay <hi>Ieruſalem:</hi> it is much miſtaken: for,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Daniels</hi> prayer was for the Sanctuary as well as for the Citle, and the Angell no doubt entendeth the building of them both.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The promiſe maketh it cleere; for the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> long before told what <hi>Cyrus</hi> Edict ſhould be: <hi>Eſay</hi> 44. 23. <hi>Let Ieruſalem bee reedified, and the foundation of the Temple layd.</hi> According to which words you muſt conſtrue the words of the Edict it ſelfe, though it expreſſe but the houſe at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> by name. The ſame being made to fulfill the word foreſpoken of by the Lord, 2. <hi>Chr.</hi> 36. 22. <hi>&amp; Ezr.</hi> 1. 1.
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:2242:82"/>
Euen as on the other ſide, by vertue of the firſt <hi>Artaxer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xes</hi> inhibition to build the City, the worke of the houſe of the Lord was reſtrained: <hi>Ezr.</hi> 4. 21. 24. So both were in true meaning ioyned together: And <hi>Ezr.</hi> 4. 12. the enemies of the Iewes wrought in the time of that firſt <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> that the Iewes were a building of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> and repairing of the walles; therefore the Edict of <hi>Cyrus</hi> bare them out to doe it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Angelioyneth the deſtruction of the Citty and the Sanctuary, both to be after 62. ſeauens, <hi>verſ.</hi> 26. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they begin together.</p>
                  <p>This is then the beginning of the ſeauens, their end is at the deſtruction of the Citie and Temple by <hi>Ueſpatian;</hi> ſo farre they reach, and are not determined by the death of Chriſt: for,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the Angels words (anſwering <hi>Daniels</hi> prayer) are ſo expreſſly, <hi>verſ.</hi> 24. <hi>Seauenty ſeauens are determined for thy holy Citie.</hi> And againe, <hi>verſ.</hi> 27. <hi>The Citie and the Sanctuary ſo all the people of a forraine Gouernour deſtroy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, the deſolation that the Romane Army ſhould make, <hi>verſ.</hi> 26. &amp; 27. and was done ſome 40. yeares after the death of Chriſt, is in the 27. <hi>verſe</hi> expreſſly made a worke of one part of the ſeauenth ſeauen.</p>
                  <p>The laſt and greateſt queſtion is touching the Meſſias here ſpoken of; for to applie it to any other than to the true Meſſiah, Chriſt our Sauiour, ſome haue branded with the marke of Iudaiſme. But Meſſiah in the abſolute (2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 21.) Meſſiah adiectiuely taken <hi>(Leuit.</hi> 4. 3. &amp;c.) the Meſſiah of Iehovah (proper vnto Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 2. 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 10.) are attributed vnto other, euen vnto ſuch as were no types of Chriſt. <hi>(Eſay.</hi> 45. 1.)</p>
                  <p>Many things there are which induce me to thinke, that this place is not to be vnderſtood of Chriſt the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Hebrue diſtinction <hi>Athnach (verſ.</hi> 24) maketh a full point after the ſeauen ſeauens, thus, <hi>from the going forth of the word to a Meſſiah gouernor ſhall be ſeauen ſeauens.</hi> Which being but 49. yeares reach not to Chriſts time. To
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:2242:82"/>
ſet the points at naught, as inuented by the Maſſorits, is to weaken all the ioints of holy writt. The ſingular vſe of <hi>Athnach,</hi> you may notablie ſee, 2. <hi>Kings</hi> 2. 14. Where this onely accent bringeth light to the true expoſition of that Scripture, and freeth it from a dangerous error, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe the text might ſeeme to giue countenance vnto.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This Meſſiah was not to be cut off whileſt Ieruſalem ſtood and flouriſhed, for ſo the Angell ſayth, <hi>ver.</hi> 26. <hi>Sixtie two ſeauens the cittie ſhall againe be built ſtreet and wall.</hi> And after thoſe ſixtie two <hi>Seauens, Meſſiah ſhall be cut off.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not meant of Chriſt; for, Ieruſalem continued built ſtreet &amp; wall ſome fortie yeares after his death. Some would needes faſten a ſtrange kinde of ſpeech vpon the Angell: for who euer ſayd 7. and 62. when he may aſwell ſay 69. Neither can it be excuſed by the Hebrue phraſe. They indeed commonly ſet the leſſer number firſt as nine and ſixtie, for ſixtie nine <hi>(Gen.</hi> 5 17.) though you may ſee by this very place that the ſame is not perpetuall. But for ſixtie nine to ſay ſeauen and ſixtie two, was neuer ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the tongue of Canaan.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is not nothing (though I will lay no great waight vpon it) which is ſaid <hi>verſ.</hi> 26. <hi>Meſſiah ſhall be cut off, and and there ſhall be nothing to him,</hi> no remaine of any power: nothing left of him. The phraſe importeth an vtter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhment without hope of reuiuer: But of the death of Chriſt the Prophets are wont to ſpeake in any other kinde of ſtile, <hi>Eſay</hi> 53. 8. <hi>By diſtreſſe and iudgement is he taken away: but his generation who ſhall declare?</hi> meaning, that for all that he ſhall liue for euer.</p>
                  <p>But to let that paſſe, how will the time of his cutting off, (if you referre it to the death of Chriſt) agree? For, after thoſe 7. ſeauens and 62. ſeauens wherein Meſſiah ſhall bee cut off, there is but one ſeauen left from thence to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To ſalue this, ſome reckon the firſt ſeauen ſeauens in Computation, after the 62. though in the Angels narrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they haue the praecedence, making the 62. to reach to
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:2242:83"/>
Chriſts baptiſme: the other ſeauen ſeauens from thence to the ruine of the ſtate and policie of the Iewes. Touching the laſt ſeauentieth that (ſay they) the Angell leaueth out, becauſe God for his Elect ſake hath ſhortened thoſe daies, as our Sauiour teacheth. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.</p>
                  <p>But firſt this maketh the holy oracle confuſed and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, if the Angell ſpeaking firſt of ſeauen ſeauens, and then of 62. ſeauens, and beginning with the latter expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly and by name, ſhould neuer make mention of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; but contrariwiſe, mention only one ſeauen <hi>[verſ.</hi> 27.] and by that vnderſtand the firſt of thoſe ſeauen ſeauens, which all entendment would carie to that which alone is behind of all the number. Againe, it were confuſed to tell firſt of the deſtruction of the City &amp; ſanctuary, <hi>[verſ.</hi> 26] and then to come backe, <hi>[verſ.</hi> 27.] to the death of Chriſt, in the firſt of thoſe ſeauen ſeauens, that is, to a thing done ſome forty yeares before: Whereas in the ſence that wee doe follow, all things flow naturally, properly, aptly, and in a method worthy of an Angell: for, firſt he layeth down the totall of the 70. ſeauens, then ſub-diuideth them into 7. 62. and one (that is to ſay, the ſeauentieth) and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth euery part in order: As by the expoſition ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, to leaue out one while ſeauen of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, can haue no excuſe. Indeed 70. ſeauens may bee ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken inſtead of ſixty nine and a halfe, or ſome ſuch parcell; and that is the rule of a round entire number put for a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken one: but to propound 70. and to handle but 69. no rule nor example warranteth. And it croſſeth the words of the Angell in the beginning; <hi>Seauenty ſeauens are each of them cut out, &amp;c.</hi> He ioyneth a verbe ſingular to a nowne plurall, to note, that euery part and period of theſe ſeauens is preciſely to hold without any fraction. As for the words of our Sauiour Chriſt, that God for the Elects ſake ſhorte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thoſe daies, they are manifeſtly wreſted. he ſhorte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned nothing of that which the Angell did foretell, when he ſpake of 70. ſeauens to bee cut out; but in his euerlaſting
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:2242:83"/>
counſell decreed thoſe dayes of the affliction of the Iewes to be but ſhort: for had they beene as long as they were ſore and eager, the whole Nation muſt haue periſhed.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore I take it, that by a Meſſiah or annointed go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour, hee meaneth a gouernour which the Iewes ſhall haue ſet vp from among themſelues, oppoſed to a forraine gouernour, <hi>verſ.</hi> 26. For, before the deſtruction of <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> by the Romanes, there were two Rulers of the Citie: one of their owne People, a Iew by profeſſion or birth; the other a ſtranger, appointed Deputy by the Romane State. The firſt Meſſiah or annointed gouernour was <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemie,</hi> whom <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> conſtituted Prince in the Land of <hi>Iudea,</hi> in the twentieth yeare of his raigne, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 5. 14. being iuſt 49. yeares from the Edict of <hi>Cyrus:</hi> Hee built a Pallace for the Princes Court, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 2. 8. and <hi>Sanballat</hi> in a Letter to <hi>Nehemie</hi> vpon his building of the walles, ſcoffeth at him, as if he meant to be King of the Iewes, <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem.</hi> 6. 6. which <hi>Nehemie</hi> there worthily putteth off, as a fiction of his owne deuiſing: <hi>Nehem.</hi> 6. 8. Whether <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie</hi> and the reſt were annointed with oyle or no, I paſſe not, no more than I doe of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> or of thoſe of whom the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 105. 15. <hi>Touch not mine annointed ones, and doo my Prophets no harme.</hi> The Angell giueth him the name of annointed; becauſe he was of that People, whom God had ſanctified to himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things praemiſed; let vs ſee how we may make vp this number of ſeauenty ſeauens, that is, of 490. yeares: which I would thus reckon.</p>
                  <p>The Perſian Monarchie, wherevnto men giue ſome 106. yeares, ſome 125. ſome 130. ſome 190. ſome 220. and the Hebrewes generally but 50. did intruth endure 70. yeares, and no more, as I gather out of the 23. of <hi>Eſay;</hi> the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in thoſe vncertainties, being the onely Oracle you can reſort vnto: In that Chapter the Prophet, <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warneth <hi>Tyrus</hi> of a threefold calamity to come vpon her: one by her home ſeruants, the ſecond by the Chaldeans, the third by <hi>Alexander</hi> the great out of the Land of <hi>Cittim:</hi>
                     <pb n="164" facs="tcp:2242:84"/>
The two latter he inſiſteth moſt vpon from the 14. <hi>verſe: Seauenty yeares ſhe ſhall be forgotten,</hi> meaning laid waſte and deſolate, <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. <hi>euen the dayes of one King,</hi> that is, during all the time of the Babylonian Empire, who for the diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of lying there ſo long in ſiege, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 29. is <hi>(Ioſephus, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 11. ſaith, 13. yeares) did beare mortall hate to her.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards ſhe ſhall flouriſh againe, be iolly and frollicke as the Prophet expreſſeth by an Apoſtrophe, or turning of his ſpeech vnto her, <hi>verſ.</hi> 16. But how long muſt that in dure? it is eaſily gathered out of the beginning of the 17. <hi>verſe;</hi> for when hee ſaith, <hi>After ſeauenty yeares the Lord ſhall reuiſite Tyrus,</hi> meaning, ſhall giue her a ſecond blow by <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, hee doth plainely ſhew that the continuance of her proſperity which was from <hi>Cyrus</hi> to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander,</hi> ſhould be 70. yeares, and conſequently that 70. yeares are the bounds of the Perſian Monarchie.</p>
                  <p>And in all reaſon it could not bee much longer, ſeeing <hi>Nehemie,</hi> who was no babe, but a Prince and a chiefe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander among thoſe that aſcended out of the captiuity in the beginning of <hi>Cyrus</hi> raigne, <hi>Ezr.</hi> 2. 2. liued to ſee the laſt <hi>Darius, Nehem.</hi> 12. 22. So as, if you gaue him then but 20 or 25. yeares, &amp; to the Perſian Monarchy but 70. he was faſt vpon 100. beyond which yeares it was not ordinary for men in thoſe dayes to liue.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the particular yeares of the Kings of Perſia, which make vp the full ſumme of 70.</p>
                  <p>The firſt King was <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who raigned three yeares, at the leaſt; hee began the third. <hi>Dan.</hi> 10. 1.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond, <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> vnder whom the Iewes are ſaid to returne; <hi>Ezr.</hi> 4. 12. whoſe returne was indeed vnder <hi>Cyrus.</hi> To him the enemies of the Iewes wrote their Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to hinder the building of the Temple, when it was yet ſcarce begun; <hi>Ezr.</hi> 4. 12. which was the ſecond yeare after their returne: <hi>Ezr.</hi> 3. 8. wherefore hee could bee no other than <hi>Cambyſes</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Cyrus</hi> that raigned in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers abſence. We giue him with the Hebrewes, after his
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:2242:84"/>
fathers death 6. yeares: the moſt that the greateſt part of Chronologers beſtow vpon him, is but 7.</p>
                  <p>The third, <hi>Aſſverus,</hi> hee is mentioned, <hi>Ezr.</hi> 4. 7. and ſeeing <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> is proued the immediate ſucceſſor vnto <hi>Cyrus,</hi> this <hi>Aſſuerus</hi> muſt needs be one that came in time after <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> though in that place of <hi>Ezra</hi> hee be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med before him. <hi>Ezraes</hi> words haue this meaning; <hi>The people of the Land diſcouraged the people of Iudah, and troubled them in building all the dayes of Cyrus, vnto the dayes of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius: for in the raigne of Aſſuerus</hi> (Predeceſſor to <hi>Darius) in the beginning of his raigne they wrote an acouſation againſt the Inhabitants of Iudah and Ieruſalem. And</hi> (before that) <hi>in the dayes of Artaxerxes, Mithredath, Tabeel and the reſt of their Colleagues wrote, &amp;c.</hi> Wherefore <hi>Tremelius</hi> looking to the ſence, doth well render it, <hi>As in the dayes of Artax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erxes, Mithredath, Tabeel, &amp;c. had written.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I take this <hi>Aſſuerus</hi> to bee <hi>Smerdis</hi> the Vſurper: for where it is ſaid, <hi>Dan.</hi> 11. 2. that before <hi>Xerxes</hi> three Kings ſhall ſtand vp in Perſia, they are not to be reckoned from <hi>Darius Medus,</hi> notwithſtanding he were ſpoken of in the firſt <hi>verſe,</hi> but from that time that the Angell ſpake the wordes, being in the raigne of <hi>Cyrus:</hi> ſo as in ſaying, <hi>three Kings ſhall yet ſtand vp, Cyrus</hi> cannot bee compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended.</p>
                  <p>The 3. Kings therefore were <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> (or <hi>Cambiſes) Aſſuerus,</hi> (or <hi>Smerdis)</hi> and <hi>Darius.</hi> Hee raigned not a yeare.</p>
                  <p>The fourth King is <hi>Darius, Ezr.</hi> 4. 5. which is <hi>Darius Hyſtaſpis:</hi> He is called King of <hi>Aſhur, Ezr.</hi> 6. 22. in the very ſame ſence that <hi>Cyrus, Ezr.</hi> 5. 13. And <hi>Artaxerxes. Nehem.</hi> 13. 6. are called Kings of <hi>Babel:</hi> for <hi>Aſhur</hi> in that place is taken for <hi>Babel,</hi> as it is alſo, <hi>Eſay</hi> 52. 4. <hi>Babylon,</hi> by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of all Hiſtorians, being anciently a part of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> and now in <hi>Darius</hi> hand, all theſe Kingdomes ioyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
                  <p>In the ſecond yeare of his raigne, he gaue leaue to build the Temple, <hi>Ezr.</hi> 4. 24. and the ſixt yeare of his raigne, hee
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:2242:85"/>
gaue leaue to build the Temple; <hi>Ezr.</hi> 4. 24. and the ſixt yeare of his raigne it was finiſhed. <hi>Ezr.</hi> 5. 6. 15.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Darius</hi> that gaue leaue to build the Temple, muſt needs be <hi>Darius Hyſtaſpis,</hi> not <hi>Darius Nothns</hi> nor any other that come long after him: for,</p>
                  <p n="1">1.

                  <p>Hiſtories giue this <hi>Darius</hi> 20. yeares, and ſo much the Computation of the 7. weekes doth warrant.</p>
                  <p>The fift King was <hi>Artaxerxes, Ezr.</hi> 7. whom I take to be ſonne to <hi>Darius Hyſtaſpis;</hi> This is that worthy Prince vnder whom <hi>Ezr.</hi> firſt found fauour for the houſe of God, <hi>Ezr.</hi> 7. and after him <hi>Nehemie</hi> had commiſſion to build the Citie and to ſettle a gouernment there, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 1. Some 33. yeares of his raigne are ſet downe, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 13. 6. In the 32. yeare of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> King of <hi>Babylon, I had returned to the King onely at the end of a yeare, I got leaue:</hi> of him is meant, <hi>Ezr.</hi> 6. 14. <hi>they built and brought it to perfection, by the aduiſe of the God of Iſrael, and by the aduiſe of Cyrus and Darius, and Artaxerxes King of Perſia. Artaxerxes</hi> is there (by anticipation) ioyned to his father <hi>Darius Hystaſpis,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the purpoſe of the holy Ghoſt was to ſet downe all the furtherers of the worke together: for albeit the ſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and edifice of the houſe was made an end of in the ſixt yeare of <hi>Darius;</hi> yet <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> by his decree furniſhed
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:2242:85"/>
the ſacrifices and the veſſels for the miniſtery of the houſe, and other neceſſaries: As it followeth in the next Chapter, <hi>Ezra</hi> 7. And ſo was a coadiutor for the perfitting of the Temple. Such anticipations are common in the Scripture. See <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. 33. 34. 35.</p>
                  <p>This decree of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> was in the ſeauenth yeare of his raigne <hi>Ezr.</hi> 7. 7. which is not to bee taken the next yeare after the ſtructure of the Temple, finiſhed in the ſixt of <hi>Darius Hyſtaſpis,</hi> as if by that it might bee gathered that <hi>Darius</hi> and <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> were all one; but ſome yeares after: for the very firſt <hi>verſe</hi> of the ſeauenth Chapter of <hi>Ezra</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth ſome kinde of inckling that there beginneth a new Story in the daies of another King. <hi>Now, after theſe things, in the raigne of Artaxerxes, King of Perſia, Ezra the ſonne of Seraiah &amp;c. went vp from Babilon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Further of the Kings of <hi>Perſia</hi> you finde nothing, ſaue that, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 12. 22. the Catalogue of the high Prieſts, is reckoned vp till the Kingdome of <hi>Darius</hi> King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> which was the laſt <hi>Darius</hi> whom <hi>Alexander</hi> the great did conquer; for <hi>Iaddua</hi> the high Prieſt there mentioned, is he that met <hi>Alexander.</hi> Therefore to the Kings that ſucceede <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> I giue among them the remainder of the 70. yeares, namely 26.</p>
                  <p>Great <hi>Zerxes</hi> I put not in this number, who ſpent his time in warres abroad, whilſt <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> did all at home: And therefore the holy Ghoſt hath him not in his Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, <hi>Dan.</hi> 11. 2. hee is named a <hi>fourth King;</hi> but that is in reſpect of the Grecians. And were he King, or no King, all his yeares are ſwallowed vp in <hi>Darius</hi> his fathers, and his ſucceſſors.</p>
                  <p>The next difficultie is in the Greeke gouernment more vncertaine than the former: for here we lacke the light of the holy Scripture to go before vs. And all other accounts whether taken from Hiſtorians in the ſucceſſion of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Kings, the high Prieſts, the Macchabees, or the <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomies</hi> of <hi>Aegypt, &amp;c,</hi> or from Aſtronomicall obſeruations, and the Ecclipſes reckoned vp in <hi>Ptolomie,</hi> or from the

                     <hi>Olympicke</hi> games which croſſe this accompt of 490. yeares, from the firſt of <hi>Cyrus</hi> to the deſtroying of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> that is the word of truth vttered by the Angell, are vaine, and not to bee beleeued.</p>
                  <p>This is certaine that the firſt 70. yeares &amp; the laſt 73. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing knowne as they are one as I haue ſhewed by <hi>Eſay,</hi> and the bookes of <hi>Ezra</hi> and <hi>Nehemie:</hi> the other by the new Teſtament and Eccleſiaſticall Storie, the interuenient time cannot bee vnknowne, though how to reckon each parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular in ſo great variety of Greeke and Latin Hiſtorians, it be a thing impoſſible: wherefore let the Greeke gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (accompting it to beginne with <hi>Alexander,</hi> and to expire at <hi>Cleopatraes</hi> death) haue 321. yeares. Betweene <hi>Cleopatraes</hi> death, and the time that our bleſſed Sauiour was borne, are commonly reckoned 26. yeares.

                  <p>The power of his Kingdome euident in aboliſhing ſin, and bringing in euerlaſting righteouſnes.</p>
                  <p>Sinne he doth aboliſh by mortifying and ſubduing the power of it by his death: by pardoning and forgiuing both the guilt and puniſhment, by the full and all-ſufficient ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction that hee hath made vpon the Croſſe, who is the propitiation for our ſinnes, righteouſnes (euerlaſting righteouſneſſe, which ſhall make vs accepted of God for euer, and neuer can be loſt as <hi>Adams</hi> was) hee doth bring in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> firſt, by the reckoning and imputing of his owne righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe vnto vs, &amp; making it ours through faith; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by wee are iuſtified or held iuſt and righteous euen in the ſtrict and moſt exact Iuſtice of God himſelfe: Secondly, by making vs new creatures by the vertue of his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
                  <p>Againe, he is our Prophet, by whom onely God ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vnto vs in theſe latter dayes, and in whom all viſions and reuelations haue an end. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 1.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, he is our Prieſt, a Miniſter of the Sanctuary, and of the true Tabernacle which the Lord pight and not man; who by his owne blood entred once into the holy place, heauen it ſelfe, purchaſing euerlaſting redemption, and aboliſhing thereby the vnction of the Law. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 8. 2. &amp; 9. 8. 12.</p>
                  <p>The ſumme of all being thus laid downe, the Angell in that which followeth brancheth the whole ſeauenty ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens into three heads or three diſtinct periods of time: <hi>From the going forth of the word, to reſtore and to build Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem:</hi> To wit, from the Edict of <hi>Cyrus, Ezr.</hi> 1. vnto a Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah (that is an annointed) gouernour, meaning <hi>Nehemie</hi> ſet vp in the twentieth of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> as we ſhewed before, ſhall be ſeauen ſeauens which make 49. yeares [1. <hi>part of verſ.</hi> 25]</p>
                  <p>In this period are comprehended all things that fell
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:2242:87"/>
out concerning the re-edifying and furniſhing of the Temple.</p>
                  <p>And of this I vnderſtand that which the Iewes ſay, <hi>Io.</hi> 2 20. <hi>fourty and ſixe yeares was this Temple a building:</hi> which is true, accompting the beginning at the third of <hi>Cyrus;</hi> for from the Edict of <hi>Cyrus</hi> one yeare muſt be giuen them to conſult about their buſines being of ſo great waight and importance. In the ſecond it is like they tooke their iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney from <hi>Babylon</hi> to <hi>Iudea</hi> is ſome 4. monethes trauaile: <hi>Ezr.</hi> 7. 8. So grant a yeare and a halfe for their returne. The ſecond yeare after their returne, the foundation of the Temple was laid and ſomwhat proceeded in <hi>Ezr.</hi> 3. 8. So as till that time, there might be 3. yeares from <hi>Cyrus</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict. Thence to the twentieth of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> are 46. yeares more: for though the Edifice and ſtructure were made an end of in the ſixt of <hi>Darius,</hi> there wanted yet houſes for the Prieſts and other neceſſaries, which were not added till about the time of <hi>Nehemie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Iewes could not by that ſpeech vnderſtand any Temple built by <hi>Herod,</hi> but this ſecond Temple: for this is it that was ſtanding in the dayes of Chriſt, <hi>Hagg.</hi> 2. 9.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond period is, <hi>three ſcore and two ſeauens,</hi> (434. yeares) wherin a Gouernour being once ſet vp, <hi>ſtreet and ditch</hi> (that is the compaſſe of the wall) <hi>ſhall againe bee built.</hi> [2. <hi>part. verſ.</hi> 25.] Theſe 434. yeares begin in that twentieth of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> when <hi>Nehemie</hi> was made the Ruler, with commiſſion to build the Citie; <hi>which times,</hi> ſaith the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell, <hi>ſhall bee troubleſome:</hi> for ſo they were, both during the time of the building of the walles; whereof, ſee the booke of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> &amp; during the whole time from thence vnto the end. In the third period are two things diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. Firſt, is the ſubuerſion of their gouernment. The Gouernour which is ſo to bee ſet ouer them from among themſelues, one of their brethren ſhall bee cut off: <hi>there ſhall be nothing to him,</hi> or <hi>he ſhall haue nothing,</hi> no more to doe there; all that forme of Gouernment ſhall vtterly be done away.

                     <pb n="171" facs="tcp:2242:87"/>
And this is preciſely laid to bee the firſt worke that the ſeauentieth ſeauen ſhould bring forth: for, <hi>After</hi> 62. <hi>ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens</hi> neceſſarily implyeth, <hi>vpon the beginning of the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentieth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond is the deſtruction of the Citie and Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary by a forraigne enemie, the Romane Armie. By whom the Iudgements of God as an innundation or ouer flowing of mighty waters, ſhall ſuddenly and violently breake in vpon them, by moſt cruell and deadly warre (for there pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in the ſiege 1100. thouſand Iewes, beſides 90. thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand taken Captiues) till they bee brought to vtter ruine, that extreame deſolation, (ſo much the plurall doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port) which God from all eternity hath preciſely purpoſed and decreed.

                  <p>And how did he ſo mightily confirme the ſame? He did confirme it mightily, both in reſpect of the Iewes, and of the conuerted Gentiles. In reſpect of the Iewes, by that Chriſt was to worke within the compaſſe of theſe weekes the rare, wounderfull, and extraordinary vengeance that he tooke vpon his enemies, the people that crucified and put him vnto death: whoſe Temple &amp; Citie that ſtood ſo long and were ſo renowned, hee cauſed for this their fault to be razed and made euen with the ground, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 34. 35. &amp; 19. 43. 44. whereby he manifeſtly declared himſelfe to be the Lord of glory.</p>

                     <pb n="172" facs="tcp:2242:88"/>
To the beleeuing Gentiles he did mightily confirme the couenant, by remouing the maine rub that lay in their way, and hindred the giuing of their names to Chriſt: Whilſt they ſaw not onely the City where our Lord was crucified to flouriſh; but the ceremoniall ſhadowes to be frequented which did obſcure and drowne the truth of his comming in the fleſh. And this end <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apoſtata had before his eyes, when in deſpite of the Chriſtian name, hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the re-edifying of the Temple.</p>
                  <p>The time, is in the middeſt of that weeke [2 <hi>part of verſ.</hi> 27.] Peraduenture the worke of the cutting of the annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Gouernour was doing the former halfe weeke; the firſt 3. years and a halfe. And indeed he that readeth <hi>Ioſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> ſhal find it fell out ſo: for about the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. yeare of <hi>Nero,</hi> (which was 7. yeares before the deſtruction of the City) <hi>Albinus</hi> the Romane Gouernour there, by his monſtrous pilling, polling and other cruelty, did as <hi>Ioſephus</hi> ſaith, <hi>ſowe the ſeede of the Cities ouerthrow:</hi> And in the twelfth of <hi>Nero,</hi> within leſſe than foure yeare after that, <hi>Agrippa</hi> the laſt Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour that the Iewes had, from among themſelues was driuen out of the Citie; whereupon <hi>Ioſephus</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Citie was without a Ruler to guide it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And ſo, you haue the Meſſiah cut off, and the Gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Citie quite extinct in the very inſtant of 3. yeare and a halfe, if it were neceſſary to flye to that.</p>
                  <p>But there is no ſuch neceſſity: The Hebrew word ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth part of a time as well as halfe. Wherefore the ſence may well bee, in part, that is, during the reſidue, the remainder of that ſeauentieth weeke, after the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed Gouernour cut off, (how long or ſhorttime ſoeuer the ſame be in doing,) he will performe the things menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in the ſecond part of the former <hi>verſe:</hi> which for the greater certainty, are heere reitterated <hi>[in the laſt part of verſe</hi> 27.] not altogether in the ſame words: but ſo as the one of theſe two verſes bringeth light vnto the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: for,</p>

                  <p>Firſt, from the Creation to the Floud, are yeares, 1656. manifeſt by the yeares of the fathers before the Floud. <hi>Gen.</hi> 5. &amp; 11.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, from the Floud vnto the Promiſe made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> 426. for from the Floud to <hi>Terah,</hi> are 221. <hi>Terah</hi> begat <hi>Abraham</hi> at 130.

                  <p>The promiſe made to <hi>Abraham</hi> was at 75. for then and not before he left his owne Country <hi>Charran</hi> (which was his Country as well as <hi>Vr,</hi> or the Valley of the Chaldeans, and both in <hi>Meſopotamia)</hi> for <hi>Canaan Gen.</hi> 12. 4.

                  <p>Of neceſſity therefore two callings of <hi>Abraham</hi> are to be diſtinguiſhed: one in <hi>Ur</hi> of the Chaldeans, which being paſſed ouer, <hi>Gen.</hi> 11. is layd downe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 7. and <hi>Stephen</hi> ſpeaketh of it, <hi>Act.</hi> 7. 2. 3.

Thus are thoſe three texts <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 17. <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 4. and <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 13. cleered. Of theſe 430. yeares, 215. were ſpent in the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> for from the 75. yeare of <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Iſacks</hi> birth, are 25. <hi>Iſaac</hi> was 60. when <hi>Iacob</hi> was borne, <hi>Gen.</hi> 25. <hi>Iacob</hi> went downe into <hi>Aegypt</hi> at 130. <hi>Gen.</hi> 47. 9.

                        <p>Secondly, the promiſe of grace, peace and reconciliation to a little remnant.</p>
                        <p>The former of the two hee comprehendeth in three Sermons.</p>
                        <p>Whereof the firſt (in this fourth Chapter) hath a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reproofe of the Iſraelites ſinnes, three in number: vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſſe, inhumanitie, ignorance of God, and an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlaced threatning of Iudgements for the ſame.</p>
                        <p>Both firſt propounded, and afterwards amplified and enlarged.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Their vnfaithfulneſſe and perfidious treachery: breaking all the duties of the ſecond Table, in moſt outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious manner like a current or a ſtreame that cannot bee kept within any bounds: inſomuch that euen bloudſhed, and murder were growne ſo common, that dead carcaſes lay by heapes one vpon another.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. But the puniſhment ſhould bee, a wofull calamitie and generall plague vpon the whole Land, &amp; all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of it.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Their barbarous inhumanity, noted to bee ſo great that they can abide no reprehenſion, ſo as it were but loſt labour to goe about to admoniſh them: They are ſo fierce, that there is no dealing with them, but they doe all manner of wickedneſſe, obſtinately and with an high hand; and
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:2242:100"/>
therefore are in as great fault as thoſe that hearken not to the Prieſt.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. But ſince they will not be ſet to rights, they ſhall ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and fall, and that preſently, both people and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, one with another, yea their Kingdome and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Citie.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. The ignorance as well of the people as of the Prieſts, maketh that both Prieſts and people ſhall be reiected.</p>
                        <p>The Prieſts, from their Prieſtly function, which they haue ſo abuſed, for their lippes ought to haue preſerued knowledge, the people from being any more his.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. An vnworthy thing that the Prieſts, eſpecially ſhould ſo much forget themſelues and ſinne ſo hainouſly againſt the Lord, by whom they were ſo much aduanced: But thoſe that honour God, hee will honour, and ſuch as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe him, ſhall be ſet light by.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. They (which is horrible to imagine) becauſe their liuelihood groweth by the ſacrifices of the People, are ſo farre from finding fault with the peoples ſinnes, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe all their heart and minde is to haue them ſinne, and as much as in them lyeth they bring in a licenſe and impunity of ſinning, to ſerue their owne bellies and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, becauſe by the peoples ſacrifices for ſinne, they haue wherewith to maintaine their gormandizing and filthy pleaſures.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. But both Prieſt and People ſhall ſmart for it and reape according as they haue ſowne.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. To gormandizors and voluptuous liuers, ſhall come famine and the plague, wherewith themſelues ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, as at the ſiege of <hi>Samaria,</hi> ſo farre ſhall they be from being full or multiplying.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. Howſoeuer, their whordome and gurmondizing ſo take away their heart that they heede not Gods threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, nor his iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, though the ſame lie neuer ſo much vpon them, and that they are in the very middeſt of them.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. Thoſe that commit ſpirituall fornication and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking God, runne a whoring after Idols, in euery place

                        <p n="15">15. <hi>Though thou Iſrael play the harlot, yet let not Iudah offend: And goe not yee to Gilgal, nor goe vp to Bethauen, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſweare Iehouah liueth.</hi>

                        <p n="15">15. From theſe premiſes groweth a concluſion, which may goe for a ſecond part of the Chapter, by way of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueat to the tribe of <hi>Iuda,</hi> not to communicate with the Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites in their ſinnes, not ſo much as to enter into their borders, (as <hi>Gilgal</hi> was their border towne) for Idolatry ſake, nor to runne a whoring after the Idoll of <hi>Bethel,</hi> which in ſcorne hee calleth <hi>Bethauen</hi> the houſe and manſion of iniquity, much leſſe to blaſpheme God, and to take his ſacred name in vaine, ſwearing and binding themſelues thereby into idolatry.</p>
                        <p n="16">16.

They neither hold them to the ſincerity of Gods ſeruice, not to the meere toyes and fooleries of the heathen; but frame to themſelues a mingle mangle out of both. And therefore may well be compared to a Cake halfe toſted, neither hot nor cold, being as wee vſe to ſpeake nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fiſh nor fleſh.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. Secondly, an incredible blockiſhneſſe, without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſence.</p>
                        <p>That albeit the euils they endure of their confederates and allies, bring gray heares vpon them, and make them old before their time, yet they not onely not conſider it:</p>
                        <p n="10">10. But (which is their third offence) they are ſo proud and inſolent, that for all this they turne away, and will not bee brought to God, but had rather ioyne themſelues to

forreigne nations, then to ſeeke after him.</p>
                        <p>The fourth and laſt offence is their madde and fooliſh conſorting with ſtrangers. So ſilly they are and without vnderſtanding to pray in ayde of thoſe whoſe minde is onely to ſpoyle and eate them vp.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. <hi>When they ſhall goe, I will ſpreade my net vpon them, and bring them downe as the foule of the heauen: I will chaſtiſe them,</hi>

                        <p n="15">15. <hi>But when I binde vp and ſtrengthen their arme; then doe they imagine miſchiefe againſt me.</hi>

                        <p n="16">16. <hi>They returne not to the moſt high, they are like a deceitfull bow, their Princes fall by the ſword, comming from the rage of their tongue: this is their deriſion in the land of Aegypt.</hi>

                        <p n="12">12. The puniſhment is, that as the fouler taketh the Doue, ſo God will enſnare and catch theſe fooliſh ones, and lay vpon them the ſcourges and corrections threatned by his Prophets.</p>
                        <p n="13">13. All becauſe of their ſinnes, eſpecially their hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, which hypocriſie of theirs is ſet forth by a diſſimilitude, when they haue need of mee that I am to doe them good, and helpe them out of trouble, in their difficulties and diſtreſſes, then they call vpon me: but all is nothing elſe, but meere diſſimulation.</p>
                        <p n="14">14. For they doe it not from their hearts; what face ſoeuer they ſet vpon it, whether it bee priuately in the night or openly in the day, yet in thoſe times of their need, in famine and want, they make a pretence, as if they would come towards me.</p>
                        <p n="15">15. But when I, as a kinde Phiſition, hold vp their

                        <p n="16">16. Turne they doe, but not vnto God, it is falſly and deceitfully: But they haue their reward according.</p>
                        <p>The ſword that ſerueth to work their conſpiracies, doth ſlay and kill the Princes. And this ſword is whet on and ſharpened by virulent tongues, ſetting debate betweene them.</p>
                        <p>Theſe murders ſo rife, and their common and dayly plotting of ſtirres and troubles in the ſtate, make them a ſcorne euen to their friends and allies.</p>

                        <p>The firſt part is a propoſition of iudgements againſt the people of Iſrael, and the cauſe of thoſe iudgements.

                        <p n="4">4. The ſecond part, is an Enarration or larger declaring of thoſe iudgements. Firſt, againſt their reuolt being of

two kinds, one from the temporall kingdome of <hi>Dauid,</hi> figuring the kingdome of Chriſt; wherein what Kings ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they ſet vp, whether you conſider <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> or any of his ſucceſſors, it was not from God, he knew them not nor approued them, becauſe it was not according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made to <hi>Dauid,</hi> but by the peoples rebellion, or their owne vſurpation. The other is from the ſpirituall worſhip, and ſeruice of God: and both theſe reuolts, the latter eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, ſhall be vnto their ruine.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. For to ſpeake of the latter, firſt, O <hi>Samaria</hi> that art the Kings chamber and Metropolitan citie, thy Calfe ſhall doe thee no good: Nay, it ſhall hurt thee exceedinglie, and prouoke my wrath againſt thee.

                        <p n="6">6. The reaſon thereof is rendred in deteſtation of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, from the cauſe, the nature and orginall of theſe Idoll gods; men inuented them: ſo did Iſraell this as well as that other Calfe in the wildernes, which brought ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny heauy plagues vpon Gods people.</p>
                        <p>The makers, are Smiths, Carpenters, and Artificers, a token it was not God.</p>
                        <p>The matter, is ſome courſe and baſe mettall.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, from the lamentable and fearefull deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not onely of the Idolls themſelues, which ſhall turne into droſſe and rubbiſh, but of the Idolaters their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers.</p>

                        <p n="8">8. Secondly, they ſhall be ſwallowed vp, their ſubſtance eaten out and conſumed.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, they ſhall be as a veſſell that none taketh plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in, deſpiſed of euery one.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. And touching the other kinde of reuolt, which wee ſet in the firſt place, the forſaking of the houſe of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and relying vpon forraine aide vpon the Aſſirian, that is,

whollie for himſelfe, and hath no minde of helping others, ſeeking it with bribes and rewards.</p>
                        <p n="10">10.

Looke vpon the late exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that is yet now freſh and bleeding before your eyes: ſo you will the better beleeue my threatning in that which is to come, I meane the ſacking and carrying away of the Tribes beyond Iordan by <hi>Pull</hi> and <hi>Tiglath Pileſer.</hi> If you aske me the reaſon, why God ſhould be ſo angry with you, it is becauſe you are ſo fooliſh, or ſo wicked rather, to ſend preſents and tributes to the King of Aſſhur, (who in the pride and vanity of his heart, nameth himſelfe the King of Princes, the mighty and moſt potent King) with the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, polling, and burdening of your ſubiects.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. Secondly, he declareth the iudgements againſt hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie. Their hypocriſie ſuch and ſo great, by multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing al<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        <p n="14">14. Thirdly, he declareth the puniſhment againſt their renouncing of all good. That it ſhall be as a fire to conſume the cities of Iuda, and the pallaces of Iſraell.

which requireth mirth and cheerefulneſſe before the Lord when men ſacrifice: whereas theſe in their captiuity haue no cauſe but of mourning and heauineſſe: for as the Law of God ſhutteth out meate offered for their dead ones, from comming into the Temple by the ſame analogye and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, the ſacrifice of thoſe than mourne are vngratefull ad not accepted of God.</p>

The fourth part of the Prophecie is a confirmation of denounced indgements, as certaine as if it were now come; that they may know and learne by miſerable experience, how their falſe Prophets did ſeduce them, vttering nothing but vanitic and winde, and the froth of their owne imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, to ſooth vp the people, and nouriſh them in euill. The confirmation therefore is from two cauſes. One their ſacrilegious diſpoſition and wickedneſſe towards God. The other, their ciuill diſcords, and home diuiſions, to the ruine of the Common-wealth, whereby many Kings roſe vp in a ſhort time.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. When I ſpeake of ciuill diſcord, I meane not onely that the Princes and people are intereſſed in this buſineſſe, but the Prophets themſelues, which are ſet of God as watchmen to ouerſee the people, and keepe them at one. They watch indeed, but far in another ſort, for they watch treacherouſly, and perfidiouſly to betray the people, to ſet them at iarre: euen the godly among them, thoſe that cleaue and hold faſt vnto my God.</p>
                        <p>The diuiſions and hart burnings of the people doe they take aduantage of, to ſet them together by the eares: ſo that this diſcord euen in the houſe of God, the Prophet in all his courſes vſeth as a fowlers grinne or ſnare to catch the poore ſoules, and to intrap them.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. But both theſe things, a ſacrilegious diſpoſition and ciuill diſcords, are hereditarie euills to the houſe of Iſraell. And as they corrupt themſelues this way, and throw one another into the depth of all iniquitie, ſinning openly and ſhameleſly, like to that their Fathers did at <hi>Gibeah;</hi> ſo ſhall they be puniſhed as their fathers were.</p>
                        <p n="10">10 For, touching their ſacrilegious diſpoſition; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare firſt, what their fathers did to <hi>Baal peor</hi> in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, where I tooke as great pleaſure in them, and they were as deare and precious vnto me, as grapes, and as the firſt ripe figs; but they forſooke me, &amp; ioyned themſelues to that ſhamefull Idoll: and as the ſway and heat of their ſpirituall luſt did lead them, as they loued and liked, ſo did
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:2242:110"/>
they multiplie Idoll after their pleaſure.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. As <hi>Ephraim</hi> therefore treadeth this way in his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers ſteps, ſo ſhall hee be partaker of their plagues. The ſonnes which are the pride and glory of their parents, I will make quicke riddance of, three manner of waies; for ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they ſhall not quicken in the wombe, or not goe out there their full time or dye as ſoone as they are borne.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. And if happily they ſcape all theſe, and haue ſome bringing vp in their childehood, yet it in all be all one, not one of them ſhall remaine aliue.</p>

                        <p n="14">14. O God therefore, ſaith the Prophet, diuerting his ſpeech to him, ſince thou haſt threatned two euils, one that their glory ſhall flit away as ſoone as they be borne or conceiued in the wombe: the other, that fathers ſhall loſe their children when they haue brought them vp: be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with that which is the leſſe euill of the twaine; eyther that there may neuer any be borne, or being borne, may for lacke of ſuſtenance dye out of hand.</p>

But I ſtay not here, I will remember you of another like example of their fathers at <hi>Gilgall.</hi> There were they wallowing in their wickedneſſe the vncircumciſion of their fleſh made me hate them.

                        <p>Firſt, I will expell them out of my houſe, and take from them my ſeruice and religion, which they deſpiſe.</p>

                        <p n="1">1. For this ſinne of Idolatrie hath brought three feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full iudgements vpon them.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, They that before were a terrour vnto all, are now of no reckoning.</p>
                        <p>The time indeed was, that if <hi>Ephraim</hi> did but ſpeake, all the tribes trembled and quaked.</p>
                        <p>But as ſoone as he offended with <hi>Baal,</hi> following after Idolatrie; he was no more ſet by, then a dead carkaſſe.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Secondly, God in his iudgement hath giuen them vp into hardneſſe of minde, and to their hearts Iuſt: that for all this ſuddaine change they repent not, but run more and more into Idolatrie.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Thirdly, Being made very fooles, at the length, they ſhall vaniſh and come to nothing.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Thus by the place, and by the effects, hee hath made odious their Idolatrie.</p>
                        <p>Now laſtly, he doth the ſame by comparing on the contrary part, his couenant with them from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and his former benefits, euen in the wilderneſſe.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Both which ought to haue beene motiues to keepe them faſt vnto him.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. The third ſinne is their pride, and loftineſſe of heart, which made them to forget God; and that in the middeſt of his bleſſings, when they had moſt cauſe to remember him. A thing that <hi>Moſes</hi> warned them of before, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.</p>

                        <p n="10">10. The former part is proued, for that none of their Kings and Princes were able to doe them good.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. For God in his wrath ſet them vp, and pulled them downe: and in a little while made many changes and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations in the kingdome.</p>

                        <p>The fourth promiſe is of a glorious Church, which ſhall be ſet vp among them: conſiſting in the points that follow;</p>
                        <p n="1">1. A moſt flouriſhing and happie eſtate, through the <note place="margin">39. Poſit. <hi>Proſperitie.</hi>
                           </note> ſweete and heauenly ſhowers of all ſpirituall, and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall benedictions, which God from heauen will water them withall.

                        <p n="6">6. Then ſhall they grow and ſpread vpwardes, be faire, freſh, and flouriſhing; Not onely ſo, but their happineſſe, ſhall be conſtant and perpetuall, like to the Oliue tree, whoſe leaues are alwayes greene.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, this ſhall make them gracious and acceptable, both with God and men.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Secondly, Other people rauiſhed with the ſight of <note place="margin">44. Poſit. <hi>All nations em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing Chriſt.</hi>
                           </note> ſuch perfections, ſhall count themſelues happie to dwell in their Tents, and as it were, vnder the ſhadow of thoſe boughes. The Nations of ſuch as are to bee ſaued ſhall walke in her light, and the Kings of the earth ſhall bring their glory and honor in vnto her. <hi>Reu.</hi> 21. 24.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The Church by this meanes ſhall be encreaſed, grow, and multiplie as eares of corne, or cluſters in the Vine; <note place="margin">38 Poſit. <hi>Multitude of beleeuers.</hi>
                           </note> for by <hi>bringing into life, or making to liue,</hi> is meant the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall propagation of Gods people, by the ſeede of the word, and power of Gods ſpirit.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The Nations ſhall honor them, and haue them in <note place="margin">45. Poſit. <hi>Nations ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring them.</hi>

                        <p>Thus doth hee comfort and arme their ſoules againſt thoſe tempeſts, that blouſtrous ſtorme and weather, which before they felt, Chapter 13. 15.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. Fiftly, the zeale of this people, when their heart ſhall turne vnto the Lord: purging of their Church from <note place="margin">34. Poſit. <hi>Puritie of doctrine.</hi>
                           </note> all corruption in Gods ſeruice, which is here noted by Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie, and the worſhip of falſe gods. They ſhall haue no

more to doe with Idoles, or any worſhip which is not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred in the name of his onely ſonne.

                           </note> wrought in them by the Spirite of Chriſt, which is the ſixt and laſt poynt.</p>
                        <p>But leaſt Iſraell ſhould take glorie to himſelfe, he telleth them that the prayſe of ſo great things, both of their turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and of this their fructifying is to be aſcribed to God alone, without whom they can doe nothing.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. <hi>Who ſo is wiſe, let him vnderſtand theſe things, prudent, let him alſo acknowledge them: for right are the wayes of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah, and the righteous ſhall walke in them, but fallers away, let them ſtumble at them.</hi>
                        </p>

Onely vnto thoſe out of whoſe loynes thou doeſt come, was the promiſe of that ſeede in whom all the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of the earth ſhould be bleſſed. To thee alone were committed the Oracles of God, for ſome thouſand yeares together. So as light ſhone in thy dwelling, when darkenes couered the whole face of the earth beſide. Of thee were the Fathers, and they from whom Chriſt came as touching the fleſh, who is God ouer all, bleſſed for euer, Amen. By the miniſtery alſo of thoſe whom he did ſend, the Law came out of <hi>Tſion,</hi> and the word of the Lord from <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> to all the ends of the earth. So great was the worth of thy Nation.</p>
                  <p>But him the Prince of life haſt thou ſlaine,
<pb facs="tcp:2242:122"/>
and nayled vpon the Croſſe, deliuered into thy hands by the foreknowledge and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate counſell of God. Whom God rayſed vp, looſing the ſorrowes of death, becauſe it was impoſſible he ſhould be maiſtred of it; for this thine offence, and to make a way for the calling of vs Gentiles; wrath is come vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee now ſixteene generations. No ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row like to the ſorrow that all this while hath befallen thee. No people ſo diſperſed, without gouernment, without Religion, without forme, eyther of Church or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth. No nation ſo contemptible &amp; abhorred in the ſight of God and Men. And that worthily; for in thee is found a ſinne of all that euer were in the world the ſhameful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt. To murder him that created thee, that by his word and workes did magnifie thee, and make thee ſo famous, that came in his owne perſon to ſaue thee: the Lord himſelfe from Heauen.</p>
                  <p>But the dayes of this thy ſinfulneſſe, God winking at, doth now euery where, and by all meanes inuite thee to repentance. Out of all the places of thy diſperſion, Eaſt, Weſt, North, and South, his purpoſe is to bring
<pb facs="tcp:2242:123"/>
thee home againe, &amp; to marry thee to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe by faith for euermore. In ſtead that thou waſt deſolate and forſaken, and fatteſt as a widdow, thou ſhalt flouriſh as in the dayes of thy youth. Nay, aboue and beyond thy youth. To be the ioy of the earth, the moſt noble Church that euer eye did ſee. Small were thy beginnings how great ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, ſo exceedingly ſhall thy latter end en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe. Thy Sauiour will ereit be long, draw neare vnto thee: not as once he did, riding vpon an Aſſe, baſe, and in humilitie, but as the glorius king of <hi>Tſion,</hi> ſubduing al things to himſelfe by the ſcepter of his word. Brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thy hard heart, fallowing vp the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes of thy ſoule, he will ſet vp all his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie in the middeſt of thee, and make thee the wonder of the world. Out of thee ſhal come gems and precious ſtones, richer then the Saphire, ruddier then the Carbuncle, ſhining aboue the Topaze. <hi>Ezraes, Nebemies, Morde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caes,</hi> builders of a better Temple then that which thou haſt doated vpon ſo long. Then ſhalt thou mourn, as the mourning for ones onely begottten ſonne: and all thy Tribes, with ſorrow and true repentance, ſhall look

vpon him whom they haue thruſt through. Thy gates ſhall be made of pearles, and thy ſtreetes of pure gold. All the Kings of the Gentiles ſhall bring their glory into thy cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and fall downe before thee. The light of the Moone ſhall be as the light of the Sun, and the light of the Sunne, ſeauen fold as the light of ſeauen dayes. Thy Sun ſhall not ſet by day, nor thy Moone by night. Bleſſed ſhall they be that bleſſe thee, &amp; curſed ſhall they be that curſe thee. When the Lord ſhall raiſe thy dead carkaſes by the miniſtrie of the Goſpell, and ſay, Awake ye that haue ſlept ſo long in the duſt of the earth.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe God wil do theſe great things for thee, doe thou prepare thy ſelfe to meete thy God. Words faile me for to ſet an edge, and to put ſome ſpirituall life into thee.

Bowing my knees to the Father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, the God of glorie, that he would haſten that which he hath ſpoken concerning thee by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets of old, and by the Apoſtles ſent by his ſonne. Whoſe counſels are without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, his loue neuer changeth: he will

not forget his promiſes to thy Fathers: but will graft thee in by faith into that naturall Oliue tree, from the which, thorough infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity thou art hitherto broken off.

And for my ſelfe, I ſhall thinke, I reape aboundant fruit of theſe my trauailes, if in the day of thy reioycing, in the day of the gladnes of thy heart, when God ſhall doe theſe great things for thee, it may beſayd that I haue layd one ſtone, (ſay it be but a peble ſtone) toward thy ſpirituall building.</p>
