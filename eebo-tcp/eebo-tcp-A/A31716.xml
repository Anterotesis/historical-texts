            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Character of a true Engliſh
SOULDIER.</head>
            <p>A <hi>True Engliſh Souldier,</hi> is a free born Son
of <hi>Courage,</hi> voluntarily put Apprentice
to the <hi>Art of War:</hi> A ſtock of <hi>Heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oak<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
fit for <hi>Laurels</hi> to be <hi>grafted</hi> on; or
a <hi>ſprig of Valour,</hi> that duely <hi>prun'd</hi> by <hi>Diſcipline</hi>
and <hi>Experience,</hi> ſprouts up in time into an <hi>Hero.</hi>
Though he take <hi>Pay,</hi> you cannot without inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
call him <hi>Mercinary:</hi> for he ſerves his King
and Country as much out of <hi>Inclination</hi> as Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity;
and differs from the <hi>common Ruffianly
Souldier of fortune,</hi> as a Charging horſe from a
Cart horſe, or a <hi>Cock of the Game</hi> from one of
Dunghill breed; ſo unlike, that they ſcarce ſeem
of the ſame Species: For he ſcorns the <hi>vices</hi> as
much as the <hi>power</hi> of his Enemies; looks upon
the Camp as a ſevere <hi>School of Vertue,</hi> not a San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary
of <hi>Debauchery;</hi> and <hi>lives</hi> like a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi>
though he <hi>fights</hi> like a <hi>Turk.</hi> He holds it, next
to his <hi>Creed,</hi> that no <hi>Coward</hi> can be an <hi>honeſt man;</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:109784:3"/>
yet never <hi>bloodies</hi> his Sword but in the heat of
<hi>Battel:</hi> For in his <hi>Quarters</hi> he is as <hi>peaceable</hi> as a
<hi>Conſtable,</hi> and aſſociates more <hi>lovingly</hi> with his
<hi>Comrades,</hi> than <hi>Monks</hi> in a <hi>Cloiſter:</hi> The reaſon
is, he is <hi>ſtout,</hi> not <hi>quarrelſome,</hi> and delights to
have the <hi>Sun</hi> behold his <hi>Valour,</hi> becauſe he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves
to do Actions <hi>worthy</hi> the Eye of Heaven.
He will never be perſwaded, that <hi>Succeſs</hi> can
juſtifie <hi>Cruelty,</hi> or Victory legitimate a <hi>Rape,</hi> or
a Storming excuſe a Sacriledge: Next to <hi>Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardize</hi>
and a <hi>Mutiny,</hi> he hates nothing ſo much
as <hi>Rudeneſs</hi> to the fair Sex, whoſe <hi>weakneſs</hi> he
allows to be their <hi>protection;</hi> being ſo honourably
merciful to <hi>Women</hi> in a ſurprizal, that the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs
of his <hi>Civilities</hi> can never be <hi>equall'd</hi> but
by thoſe of his <hi>Proweſs.</hi> 'Tis true, he is a <hi>Lover,</hi>
but 'tis of <hi>Danger and Glory,</hi> whom he <hi>courts</hi>
(as <hi>Jove</hi> did <hi>Semele</hi>) in Clouds of <hi>Smoak</hi> and
<hi>Thunder;</hi> and appears more <hi>brave and lovely</hi> to
a judicious Ladies eye in a tatter'd <hi>Red Coat</hi> or
ſuit of <hi>Buff</hi> (allow him but his <hi>Arms</hi> for <hi>Trimming</hi>)
than your little ſprucified <hi>man of mode</hi> in his
powdred <hi>Wig</hi> and Cloth of <hi>Tiſſue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He is ſo abhorrent from <hi>treacherous Murders</hi>
or <hi>crol-blood-Maſſacres,</hi> that when he looks upon
his Enemies dead body in the <hi>Field,</hi> 'tis with a
kind of noble <hi>pity,</hi> no <hi>inſultation.</hi> He attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
the whole glory of a Conqueſt to God's
mercy and his Generals conduct; and always <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares</hi>
for <hi>Death,</hi> though he never <hi>fears</hi> it. He
thinks not out of his own Calling, when he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
Life <hi>a continual Warfare;</hi> and his Prayers
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:109784:3"/>
then beſt become him, when, armed <hi>Cap a pe,</hi> he
looks as if he had a deſigne to take at once both
Earth &amp; Heaven by violence. Before an Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
he ſigns out ſome ſuch ſhort, but zealous
Ejaculation: <hi>Lord, remember me <hi>anon,</hi> when I
ſhall be too apt to forget thee!</hi> and then falls on as
reſolutely and unconcern'd as to a Feaſt. He is
ſo confident of victory, that he always gives the
<hi>On-ſet</hi> with a <hi>Hallo</hi> and Shouts of triumph; and
purſues a Charge ſo furiouſly, that he is in with his
Enemy almoſt as <hi>ſoon</hi> as his <hi>Bullet,</hi> ready, if that
miſſes, with the <hi>Butt end</hi> of his Muſquet to do
Execution. He fears a <hi>Sword</hi> no more than an
<hi>Ague;</hi> and counts, the roaring of Cannons and
<hi>whiſtling</hi> of Small-ſhot, m<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ke as pleaſant Muſick
as the Baſe and Treble in Conſort. His Courage
is <hi>natural,</hi> not borrowed from the Inſpirations of
<hi>Drink,</hi> or thruſt upon him by the neceſſity of
<hi>Deſpair.</hi> 'Tis a baſe and malicious ſcandal to
ſay, That his Valour <hi>ebbs</hi> and <hi>flows</hi> with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of his <hi>Snapſack,</hi> or that he can never fight
well unleſs <hi>Beef</hi> and <hi>Bag-pudding</hi> be his <hi>Seconds.</hi>
'Tis true, the Fertility of his Country has inur'd
him to a <hi>plentiful Diet,</hi> and he would willingly
have his <hi>body</hi> in good <hi>plight,</hi> to keep pace with
the <hi>vigor</hi> of his <hi>mind:</hi> Yet he can endure the moſt
pinching <hi>Neceſſities,</hi> and, led on by Honour, will
hold out a <hi>Campagne,</hi> though <hi>Hunger</hi> and <hi>Cold</hi>
march never ſo cloſe in the ſame <hi>File</hi> with him.
He is true <hi>Steel,</hi> which may be <hi>bent</hi> by violence,
but in a minute return to its former poſture.
Thus he may be <hi>overcome,</hi> but never <hi>conquer'd:</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:109784:4"/>
for he will <hi>Rally</hi> after the <hi>Tenth Repulſe,</hi> and
pluck <hi>Victory</hi> back by the <hi>wing,</hi> when ſhe is <hi>flying</hi>
away to the <hi>Enemy.</hi> Beſiege him never ſo <hi>ſtrictly,</hi>
ſo long as the <hi>Air</hi> is not ſhut up from him, his
heart <hi>faints</hi> not: for, like <hi>Hannibal,</hi> he always
either <hi>finds</hi> a way, or <hi>makes</hi> it.</p>
            <p>But Valor and endurance of Hardſhips are but
two parts of a Souldier; that which compleats
him is <hi>Obedience;</hi> in which our true <hi>Engliſhman</hi>
is ſingularly <hi>exemplary;</hi> never did any ſo much
<hi>ſlight</hi> his Enemy, and ſo <hi>revere</hi> his <hi>Chief.</hi> The
<hi>Roman</hi> Legions could not boaſt a Spirit at once ſo
<hi>fierce</hi> and ſo <hi>docile,</hi> that could overflow the Field
with mote <hi>impetuoſity,</hi> and retire to his place in
the Camp with leſs appearance of having ever
gone out. The <hi>reſpect</hi> he bears his <hi>Officers,</hi> is
more <hi>powerful</hi> than the Right of <hi>Life and Death</hi>
they have over him. He is more apprehenſive of
their <hi>Anger,</hi> than of the Law Martial and <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances</hi>
of <hi>War:</hi> for he obeys for <hi>love,</hi> not fear;
and reſents their <hi>diſpleaſure</hi> more terribly than
any <hi>puniſhment.</hi> He diſputes no <hi>Orders,</hi> but <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutes</hi>
them; and will charge up to a <hi>Cannons</hi>
mouth, or make a <hi>Scalado</hi> th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ough ſhowers of
Bullets, and the midſt of <hi>Flames</hi> naked, if his
Country's Honour, or his <hi>Generals</hi> Command re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
it.</p>
            <p>Thus far we have ſeen him in his private ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity,
now behold him when <hi>Merit</hi> has intituled
him to a <hi>COMMAND;</hi> you ſhall finde in his
action neither a <hi>cowardly or heavy</hi> coldneſs, nor
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:109784:4"/>
a raſh precipitate vehemence; though he doth
nothing meanly, yet he doth nothing with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
but ſoftly makes haſte, and advances with
an inſenſible motion. He cheriſhes his Souldiers
as tenderly as a Father his <hi>Children,</hi> and had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſave <hi>one</hi> of their Lives, than kill <hi>ten</hi> of his
Enemies. He does not train by the <hi>Book,</hi> dully
reckoning up ſo many Poſtures of the <hi>Pike</hi> and
<hi>Muſquet,</hi> as if he were counting a Game at <hi>Nod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;</hi>
but, having a perfect <hi>Idea</hi> of the whole <hi>Art
Military,</hi> Theorick and Practick, inſtructs every
one according to his capacity, and <hi>prefers</hi> or <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes</hi>
with a juſt reſpect to <hi>Merit.</hi> He endures
equal toil with the meaneſt Souldier; is the
<hi>firſt</hi> in giving a Charge, and the <hi>laſt</hi> in retiring
his Foot. From his <hi>Example</hi> they all take fire,
as one <hi>Torch</hi> lighteth many. He hath learn'd as
well to <hi>make uſe</hi> of a Victory, as <hi>obtain</hi> it; for
then, purſuing his Enemies like a Whirlwind, he
carries all before him, being aſſured that is the
time to compleat their Ruine, when they have
loſt <hi>Force, Wiſdom, Courage,</hi> and <hi>Reputation.</hi>
He is the <hi>univerſal Genius</hi> that actuates all under
his charge, and moves them, as the <hi>Intelligences,</hi>
without tiring themſelves, are ſaid to turn about
the Coeleſtial Spheres. Obſerve how with his
<hi>Eyes</hi> he leads the whole Army! How a <hi>nod</hi> of
his Head keeps thouſands in their Duty! How
onely his <hi>preſence</hi> eſtabliſheth Order, and drives
away confuſion! He knows in War there is no
admitting of a <hi>ſecond errour,</hi> the firſt and leaſt
fault being ſufficient to ruine an Army; he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:109784:5"/>
makes it his buſineſs to prevent faults, not
to <hi>pardon</hi> them; and makes thoſe that are <hi>Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents</hi>
of Diſorder, Mutiny, Negligence, or <hi>Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardize,</hi>
repair their offence to the whole, by being
<hi>Examples</hi> of his <hi>Juſtice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His <hi>Loyalty</hi> to his Prince, and his <hi>Love</hi> to his
Sou<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>diers, are eſſential parts of his Soul; he
would neither <hi>betray</hi> the one, nor <hi>defraud</hi> the
other for a greater Empire than <hi>Caeſars;</hi> little
ſeeming <hi>affronts</hi> at home cannot diſoblige him;
nor mighty <hi>Offers</hi> from abroad draw him to a
Compliance: He ſcorns Honour purchaſed by
<hi>diſhonourable</hi> means, is Shot free againſt the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
golden Bullets, and impenetrable to <hi>Vanity,</hi>
as well as <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Avarice.</hi> He at once ſubverts
diſcovered endeavours, and guards himſelf from
<hi>hidden</hi> Artifices. Neither the Poiſon brought
from afar, nor the neighbouring corrupted Air,
nor Stranger, nor Friend, nor Hopes, nor Fears,
nor Threats, nor Flatteries, have power to change
the goodneſs of his Conſtitution; or <hi>warp</hi> him from
his duty.</p>
            <p>He ſcorns to make a <hi>Trade</hi> of War by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
it unneceſſarily for his own profit or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
yet maintains it is never to be given o're
but on one of theſe three, conditions: An honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
and well aſſured <hi>Peace,</hi> abſolute <hi>Victory,</hi> or
an honeſt <hi>Death.</hi>
            </p>
