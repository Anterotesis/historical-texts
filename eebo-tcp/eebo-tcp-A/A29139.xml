         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

OF
The Proceedings, Examination, Tryal, and
Horrid Murder of Collonel <hi>Euſebius
Andrewe.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>ON Munday the <hi>24th.</hi> of <hi>March</hi> 1649. Col.
<hi>Andrewe,</hi> was taken priſoner at <hi>Graveſend</hi> by Major
<hi>Parker,</hi> and by a Troop of horſe that night con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
to the <hi>George</hi> in Kings ſtreet <hi>Westminſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next day, he was convented before the Lord
Preſident <hi>Bradſhaw,</hi> Sir <hi>Henry Mildmay</hi> Knight, &amp; <hi>Thomas Scot</hi>
Eſquire, three of the Members of State, delegated by the Council
for the taking of the examination of him, and of Sir <hi>Henry
Chichley</hi> Knight, Doctor <hi>Henry Edwards,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Clark,</hi> ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually
found in the ſame Inn with Mr. <hi>Andrewe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thoſe Gent. examined him ſo punctually to every action and
circumſtance that had paſſed on his part ſince he took up Armes,
and eſpecially ſince the render of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and his return from
thence to <hi>London;</hi> and alſo concerning his ſeveral Lodgings,
Names, Acquaintances, Removes, Abodes in the Countrey,
correſpondencies by Letters, and intereſt in places and perſons,
as if they had kept a Diary for him. Which conſidered, and
that Sir <hi>John Gell</hi> Baronet, Major <hi>Barnard,</hi> Captain <hi>Smith,</hi>
Captain <hi>Benſon,</hi> and Captain <hi>Aſhley,</hi> (with whom he had the
laſt and moſt queſtionable correſpondence,) were all in cuſtody,
he found himſelf to be betrayed, but could not at preſent gueſs
by whom, but well ſaw that he had better be fair in his confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54289:3"/>
then to deny what he ſaw by the perfectneſs of his exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
would be proved againſt him, by the diſcoverie of ſome
of thoſe formerly ſecured, and examined before his comming
up; and was reſolved to beare the worſe, and not ſo much to
ſhame himſelf, or his matter, as to deny things evident, or
eaſily evidenceable, but rather to caſt himſelf upon God, and
come off as well as he could with a truth in his mouth, as the
beſt way to meet death without ſhame.</p>
            <p>In his Anſwers, he would have bin circumſtantial, but was
kept cloſe to the Queſtion; at his departure he deſired that he
might ſet down his own Narrative, according to his own ſence,
which was granted him to prepare, and to ſend or bring to them
as there was opportunity. And having totally, as much as in
him lay, excuſed (as was juſt for him to do) his fellow pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners,
as to any thing related to his Delinquency, he was with
them committed to the Gatehouſe.</p>
            <p>Wedneſday following, he was reconvented and reexamined.</p>
            <p>On Friday, he was again convented, and delivered in his Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative
to the Lord Preſident, and the Houſe by buſineſs happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
detaining the other two examiners, he was by the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
returned.</p>
            <p>On Saturday, he was recalled, and the<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> as at all times before,
uſed and treated with civility, and no little preſſure to dciſover
ſome great perſons, his ſuppoſed confederates; the aime, as he
conjectur'd (and that upon ſtrong inference, and ſome expre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſions)
was at Sir <hi>Guy Palmes,</hi> Sir <hi>John Curſon,</hi> and Sir
<hi>Thomas Whitmore &amp;c.</hi> But he accounted it a great bleſſing in
his inhappineſs, that his misfortune was not cumulative, nor
fatal to any his friends or familiars, who yet knew nothing of
the reaſon of his Impriſonment, more then for what they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
to common fame, and had no ſhare in his fault, (ſuch
as it was) and he was glad that he could as well engroſs the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
to himſelf.</p>
            <p>On Sunday next, he was called out of his bed, and by two
Meſſengers, his Keeper, and his Man, brought into a boat at
Kings-bridg at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and thence carried to the Tower.
The warrant which at the Lievtenants houſe was read, imported,
That he was committed cloſe priſoner for high treaſon, in endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54289:3"/>
to ſubvert the preſent Goverment, &amp;c. To be kept till
delivered by Law.</p>
            <p>He was deſigned by the Lievtenant, Collonel <hi>Francis Weſt,</hi> to
a priſon-lodging; but having notified to him his quality, he
was put into the cuſtody of Mr. <hi>Richard Standon,</hi> one of the
Yeomen Warders, in his houſe, equally convenient with the
beſt in the Tower. At his coming to the Tower he had but two
ſhillings in his purſe, and ſuppoſing he ſhould have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
for diet as the States priſoner, he ſent to the Lievte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
to know what he would order for him? who returned, That
if he had money he might have what he would, but at his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
nothing.</p>
            <p>His Keeper was upon his delivery to his charge, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to keep him ſafe, and if he eſcaped threatened to be hang'd,
and a centinel ſet immediatly at the dore, and that day two
Gentlewomen comming to ſee him, were all night impriſoned
in the Round-houſe, and next day carried to the Council of
State, and ſtrictly examined.</p>
            <p>His Waterman that week brought him ſome money, for
which, and ſome affectionate words ſpoken of him, he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
before the Preſident, examined, rebuked, and diſmiſſed;
and a centinel ſet at the window of M. <hi>Andrews</hi> Lodging, that
he might not ſpeak to any without.</p>

me tranſcripts of Letters, (with the coppying of which he
pretended to be entruſted under Mr. <hi>Ruſhworth</hi>) which did appear
to purport the occurrences in reference to the affaires of the State,

inſtructions, to draw a petition for Sir <hi>John Gell,</hi> for the getting

not, &amp; that he deſired to be ſo underſtood, and when opportunity

that if ever he took up armes again, it ſhould be for the Prince:
and at ſeveral other ſubſequent meetings, the diſcourſes were
general, and much to this purpoſe, but no particular deſign laid
or contrived.</p>
                           <p>The time limited by the Act for departure, &amp;c. being neer

termes ſignifie, that it was an eaſy matter, eſpecially, the Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers
going out of the Town, by correſpondence in all counties,
to ſurpriſe the horſe of the army in their ſeveral quarters; and did
intimate, that Major <hi>Barnard</hi> had a deſign in a draught, which as

My Anſwer was,<note place="margin">My Anſwer.</note> That if the money were ready I would divert

                           <p>Sunday morning, they came again and informed me, that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
perſons of quality and fortune in <hi>Kent, Buckingham,</hi> and
<hi>Dorſet,</hi> were, or would then preſently come up neer the

<hi>Guy Palmes,</hi> and <hi>Mr. Fitzherbert,</hi> and a fourth perſon, whoſe
name I remember not; and therefore deſired me to draw an

or one of them, the ſaid <hi>Barnard,</hi> or <hi>Benſon,</hi> inſtructed) and to
move Sir <hi>John Gell</hi> to joyn in ſuch an engagement, but did not

of their before mentioned friends, amongſt whom, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
only theſe Sir-names <hi>Boyes, Thatch, Baker,</hi> all to me
abſolute ſtrangers.</p>
                           <p>That day I ſpake with Sir <hi>John Gell,</hi> and acquainted him
with their offer and propoſal to me,<note place="margin">Sir John Gell.</note> and deſire from him. He
anſwered, That he would not meddle with acting in that deſign
(which he took upon him to be acquainted withal,) for which he
was as then in no capacity, nor would be engaged under his hand
&amp; ſeal, to be bound to be any future action for them, for that <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>
was a fellow given to drink, and laviſh of his tongue; but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted
me that if I went over upon rhis occaſion, to poſſeſſe the

againſt him; &amp; if he were at all in command, he would be ſo to his
advantage, or to that effect.</p>
                           <p>I returned to them Sir <hi>John Gells</hi> anſwer, with which they
were not, or ſeemed not altogether unſatisfied, and appointed on

Buckingham,</hi> and <hi>Dorſet,</hi> or ſome of each Countie from the

from place to place to lay the deſign.</p>
                           <p>At the time I came, and Major <hi>Barnard</hi> produced two let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,

that the <hi>Kentiſh</hi> Gentlemen were come as farr as <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> and
would that night be within twelve miles of <hi>London,</hi> and lie there
all day, and then in the evening, on Tueſday by eight of the

and that they had ſent an eſpeciall guide to bring <hi>Barnard</hi>
to them that night, whether he was inſtantly deſired to repaire
and that they durſt come no nearer in feare of the watchfullneſs
of Collonel <hi>Blunt;</hi> and that two hundred and fifty pounds were
ready to be laid down to perform their undertaking. No man
of any Countie giving any meeting according to the firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
at the Cranes, but the ſaid <hi>Barnard,</hi> and <hi>Benſon,</hi> and
one who calls himſelf Captain <hi>Aſhley,</hi> only known in face
to me, who pretended to be privy and knowing of the truth
of all what their former diſcourſe and theſe letters tended to;
and <hi>Barnard</hi> pretending to go inſtantly to horſe from <hi>Weſtminſter;</hi>
I brought him and <hi>Benſon,</hi> to the water ſide, and in the walk they
importun'd me again to obtain Sir <hi>John Gells</hi> ſignature, and
ſeale to the engagement, which <hi>Benſon</hi> had then ready engroſſed,

brought me a letter from Major <hi>Barnard,</hi> highly reproving me,

to Sir <hi>John,</hi> that under an Oath of ſecreſie he would ſatisfie
him, but durſt not truſt <hi>Benſon,</hi> and <hi>Barnard</hi> was to him a

him: with which letter <hi>Barnard</hi> and <hi>Smith</hi> went away, with

neer <hi>Michaelmas</hi> Terme, when he told me, that the inſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesfulneſs

                           <p>As to the day, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>18th</hi> day of <hi>October,</hi> being the
Fair day at <hi>Ely,</hi> it was only in diſcourſe mentioned to be an
opportune time, in caſe the <hi>Iſle</hi> were (as indeed it was not)
Garriſond. Neither any ſolemn or ſerious deſign or concluſion,
then to-fore or then after made or laid, other then in tranſient

promiſe, until this freſh ſtratagem was ſet on foot by <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>I drew Sir <hi>John Gells</hi> petition before <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> and had ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
complements from him by <hi>Holmes,</hi> (at leaſt pretended)
before I ſaw him, and I believe after Twelftide I was invited
to him, and entruſted by him in the compoſing the differences
between him and his Lady: In the laſt Terme I drew his anſwer,
and in the ſeveral times of our caſual or occaſional meeting,
the diſcourſes have amounted to what I have before ſignified,
and in your preſence and his avowed, and how more exactly to
give your Lordſhips an account in time I cannot.</p>
                           <p>As to the matter of the engagement I abide by what I have
formerly ſaid, with this only, that at my engaging, which was
late in the night, before my going out of Town, in obedience
to the Act, I was promiſed by <hi>Benſon,</hi> that if Sir <hi>John Gell,</hi>
and their pretended friends of the Countrey did not co-engage,
I ſhould be diſengaged; and in the hour of my going away, <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi>
being not ready according to promiſe, but by <hi>Benſon</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:54289:9"/>
to be at <hi>Tottenham</hi> Court with ſome <hi>Buckinghamſhier</hi>
men, and that he would undoubtedly follow, I told <hi>Benſon</hi> as
I remember in the preſence of Captain <hi>Aſhley,</hi> that whether
he came or not, I muſt for the preſent remove to <hi>Graveſend</hi>
not having convenience of horſe to go elſwhither ſo ſuddenly,
and if there were performance on <hi>Barnards</hi> part with me, I
ſhould be ready on mine, and if not, I deſired to be diſenga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,

I did really carry with me deeds of my Clients, to have employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

                           <p>THat your petitioner hath been by a confederate pack of

ſuppoſed, had intereſt to have drawn divers perſons of quallity

                           <p>That failing of that part of their aime, the ſaid confederates
did betray your petitioner to the honorable Council of State,

without a fortune of his own, the acceſs of friends, or means

it be diſtinguiſht by a publick Tryal, whether he be a fitter
object for the applying of your juſtice, or your mercy.</p>
                           <p>That he is hereby diſabled to be accountable to the ſervice of
God, the duty to his family and friends, and to thoſe who give
him credit for bread. And in caſe he ſhould be call'd from ſuch
his cloſe reſtraint to his tryal, muſt be deſtitute and deprived
of all fair means of making his reaſonable defence, which how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever

                           <p>Your petitioner having, for releif in the premiſes, by all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune

                           <p>1. That you would prevent your Juſtice by your mercy, and

Court.</p>
                              <p>Firſt, That by the Statute or Charter ſtiled <hi>Magna Charta,</hi>
which is the fundamental Law, and ought to be the ſtandard
of the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> confirmed above thirty times and yet
unrepealed, it is in the <hi>29th.</hi> Chapter thereof <hi>Granted</hi> and
<hi>Enacted,</hi>
                              </p>

diſſeiſed of his free hold or liberties, or free cuſtome, or be

ſhall not paſs upon him, nor condemn him, but by a lawful
Judgment of his Peeres, and by the Laws of the Land.</p>
                              <p>2. We ſhall ſell to no man, nor deferr to any man Juſtice or
right.</p>
                              <p>Secondly. That by the Statute of 42 of <hi>Edward 3d.</hi> Cha. 1.</p>
                              <p>1. The Great Charter is commanded to be kept in all the
points. And</p>
                              <p>2. It is enacted that if any Statute be made to the Contrary,
that ſhall be holden for none, which Statute is unrepealed.</p>
                              <p>The Reſpondent obſerveth that by an Act of the 26 of
<hi>March</hi> 1650. Entitled an <hi>Act for eſtabliſhing an High Court
of Juſtice,</hi> Power is given to this Court to Try, Condemn, and
cauſe Execution of Death, to be done upon the Freemen of

Members thereof, ſhall judg to appertain to juſtice.</p>
                              <p>And thereupon the Reſpondent doth humbly inferr and
offereth for law,</p>
                              <p>That the ſaid Act is diametrically contrary unto, and
utterly inconſiſtent with the ſaid Great Charter, and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:54289:15"/>
by the ſaid recited Statute to be holden for none.</p>
                              <p>That it can with no more reaſon, equity, or juſtice, hold
the value and reputation of a Law (the ſaid Statute before reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
being in force) then if, contrary to the ſecond clauſe in
that <hi>29th</hi> Chap. of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> it had been alſo enacted,
that Juſtice and Right ſhall be deferred to all freemen, and
ſold to all that will buy it.</p>
                              <p>Thirdly, That upon premiſing, by the Petition of Right
<hi>3d Car.</hi> that contrary to the great Charter Tryals, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutions,
had been had and done againſt the Subjects by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions
Martial, &amp;c. It was therefore prayed, and by the
Commiſſion enacted, That</p>
                              <p>1. No Commiſſions of the like nature, might be thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
iſſued, &amp;c. and that done</p>
                              <p>2. To prevent, leaſt any of the Subjects ſhould be put to death
contrary to the Laws and Franchiſe of the Land.</p>
                              <p>The Reſpondent humbly obſerveth and affirmeth, That</p>
                              <p>This Court is (though under a different ſtile) in Nature,
and in the proceedings thereby directly the ſame with a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
Martial; the Freeman thereby being to be tryed for
life, and adjudged by the major number of the Commiſſioners
ſitting (as in Courts of Commiſſioners Martial was practiſed,
and was agreeable to their conſtitution) and conſequently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Petition of Right, in which he, and all the freemen
of <hi>England</hi> (if it be granted there be any ſuch) hath and
have right, and intereſt, and he humbly claims his right accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.</p>
                              <p>Fourthly, That by he Remonſtrance 15 of <hi>December,</hi> and
the Declaration 17 <hi>January</hi> 1641. The benefit of the Laws
and ordinary Courts of Juſtice, are the ſubjects Birth-rights.</p>
                              <p>By the Declarations of the <hi>12th July</hi> and <hi>16th October</hi>
1642. the preſervation of the laws, and the due adminiſtration
of juſtice, are owned to be the juſtifying cauſe of the warr;
and the ends of the Parliaments affaires, managed by their
ſwords and Councils; And Gods curſe is by them imprecated,
in caſe they ſhould ever decline thoſe ends.</p>
                              <p>By the Declaration of 17 <hi>Apr.</hi> 1646. promiſe was made not
to interrupt the courſe of Juſtice in the ordinary Courts thereof.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <pb n="27" facs="tcp:54289:15"/>
By the Ordinance or Votes of non-addreſſes, <hi>Jan.</hi> 1648. it
is aſſured of the Parliaments behalf, That</p>
                              <p>Though they lay the King aſide, yet they will govern by the
laws, and not interrupt the courſe of Juſtice in the ordinary
Courts thereof.</p>
                              <p>And thereupon the Reſpondent humbly inferreth and affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth,
That</p>
                              <p>The conſtitution of this Court is a Breath of that publick faith
of the Parliments, exhibited, and pledged in the Declarations,
and votes to the Freemen of <hi>England.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>And upon the whole matter the Reſpondent (ſaving as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid)
doth humbly affirme for law, and claime as his right.</p>
                              <p>That this Court, in defect of the validity of the Act, by
which it is conſtituted, hath not power againſt him, or to preſs
him to a farther Anſwer.</p>
                              <p>That by vertue of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> the Petition of Right,
and the before recited Remonſtance and Declarations, he ought
not to be proceeded againſt by this Court, but by an ordinary
Court of Juſtice, and to be tryed by his Peeres.</p>
                              <p>And prayes, That this his preſent Anſwer and Salvo may be
accepted, and regiſtred, and that he may be tryed by his Peeres
accordingly.</p>

                              <p>1. The Court in their capacity of Tryers ought (in reaſon)
to have been appointed by their conſtitution, to have been
ſworn as Tryers in full Court, according to the practiſe in all
equall wayes of Tryall.</p>
                              <p>2. The Court as Commiſſioners of Oyre, and Terminer,

                              </p>

adminiſtred to Jurors; <hi>viz.</hi>
                              </p>

have condemned the freeman, the Reſpondent, or other, by
applying their skill and knowledg, to their power; whether
juſtly or not, the oath by them taken is not in the letter broken; as
to be exactible by man, though God will provably have a better
accompt.</p>
                              <p>And therefore upon the whole matter premiſed, the Reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent

friends (if I have any here) begin to fear, the indifferent to
doubt, and the partial to deſire, and joyne in my condemnation,
my ſelf (I hope I am not partial to my ſelf) believe, that it
will be no more then the mountaines labour,<note place="margin">Perturient montes &amp;c.</note> and when it ſhall
come to be diſſected, will prove to be <hi>inane aliquid,</hi> like the

then ſatisfie the appetite in its expectation upon them.</p>

                     <hi>My Lord,</hi> I am at an unuſual Barr, and engaged in a great cauſe of a
far extendible concernment, my fee is life, and my duty is ſelf-preſervation,
which in it ſelf were leſs conſiderable, if by a
preſident of my ſuff'ring, the conſequence would not prove
miſchievouſly Epidemical.</p>
                  <p>I do not willfully refuſe to plead to the charge, but humbly
crave leave to offer my reaſons for the ſuſpending of my <hi>Plea.</hi>
And if I be importunate (yet within the bounds of civility)
I beg your pardon, and that I may have a full, a free, and an
uninterrupted hearing.</p>

at the time when it was preferred, and received the Royal aſſent,
muſt never be forgotten by thoſe who hold in eſteem the care

                  <p>In the Proeme or leading part of that Petition, the Statute
of <hi>Magna Charta</hi> is inſtanced as to this particular, tryal for
life by proper Courts, with other the Laws and Statutes (ſome of
which I have cited, and the reſt ſhall upon another point in their
place;) and as it is complained, that proceedings had been by
Commiſſioners Martial; when and where, if by the Laws and
Statutes of the land they had deſerved death, by the ſame
Laws and Statutes alſo they might, and by no other laws ought
to have been judged; ſo is it prayed, and accordingly enacted,
That no Commiſſions of like nature may be henceforth iſſued
to any perſon or perſons whatſoever, to be executed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and
this to prevent, leaſt by colour of them any of the Subjects
ſhould be deſtroyed or put to death, contrary to the laws and

perſons commiſſioned, being as this power is to you, ſo thoſe
alwayes given to perſons of quality and learning; but the evil
of them were their Proceedings by their own will and opinion,
being themſelves the Judges, and the Jury; offices incompatible

Laws become their rights; when your Lordſhips ſhall read the
Act by which you now ſit, I am confident you will grant this

Law and uſage, that it is againſt common and vulgar reaſon;

of a Law; and more of a warrant of Arbitrary Execution, then
of an enablement, to and for a judicial and legal Proceeding or
Tryal.</p>

thing is but neceſſary in your Lordſhips and this Court to be
done, (if at all you will proceed in ſo weighty a matter as life)
againſt which I make this exception.</p>
                  <p>1. If you are at all ſworn, you are not ſworn in <hi>Conſpectu,</hi>
and if you will be my Jury and my Judges alſo, I ought to have
a ſatisfaction that you are ſo ſworn. Had you been only my
Judges, and conſtituted after the ordinary manner, and to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary

                  <p>2. If you are ſworn, (and to no other words of an oath then
what are compriſed in the Act) (which my ſelf and all men
elſe will eaſily believe you are not) then you are not ſworn to
any manner of Equality.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>The words Pertinent only are theſe,</hi> You ſhall ſwear that well and lawfully you ſhall ſerve our

                  <p>My Lord, theſe will concern you as my Judges, to conſider
how little the ſtiles agree, &amp; how far your Oath is in reſpect of
theſe unobligatory, and conſequently unſatisfactory to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons

                  <p>1. As to the firſt, yours contains no ſuch words of Equality.</p>

                  <p>My Lord, as you are my Tryers alſo, as well as my Judges, I
beſeech you to obſerve the oath of a Juror, and the difference
in ſence, (in letter I know for the dignity ſake it ought to

I muſt needs ſay, and it is apparant, that when you have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed

exact from you (though God will have a better reckoning) and
in ſtead of being tryed by ſworne Jurors, and adjudged by

ſome of them poſſibly not judging their own Judgments, but
concurring where their opinion of anothers Judgment ſhall lead
them; which as it was the great evil of the late Court of Star-chamber,
ſo whereſoever it is uſed (in tryals of life eſpecially)
it is and can be no other then an evil.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>My Lord,</hi> By &amp; from a Jury a verdict paſſeth before their diſcharge upon
their neceſſary affairs, nay affairs of nature, &amp; therefore will give
it both the righter, becauſe their evidence is freſh in memory,
without the intervention of other matters, as alſo for that they
are without opportunity to be perverted by money, or friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.
If this Court receive the evidence to day, they may at any
time (before the 29 day of <hi>September</hi> next) give their ſentence;
for <hi>vere dictum</hi> I never expect but from a Jury; and in the
mean time, how much their own affaires may put the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance

                  <p>1. If the Court proceed upon Articles,<note place="margin">Gen. iſſue to particular Art</note> they cannot in reaſon
conceive that I can plead the general iſſue to particulars; for in
ſo doing, in caſe I be convinced of any one Article, I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive

                  <p>The Articles are of ſeveral kinds and crimes,<note place="margin">Several crimes &amp; ſeveral Anſw. neceſſary.</note> and as one

his proper Anſwer, which though in Indictments is not allowed,
yet in this way of proceeding was never denyed in the moſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary

to a Commonwealth.</p>
                  <p>1. Protection in the State.</p>
                  <p>2. Perſonal engagement, or fealty in the Subject.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Protection I have received none, but ſtand in the
condition of a proſcribed perſon.</p>
                  <p>1. State (if any) ſequeſtrable, and not permitted by the
laws of the nation to vindicate it.</p>
                  <p>2. Calling taken away, which the Turke would not have
done, had he been conqueror.</p>
                  <p>3. Dwelling not permitted where I can ſubſiſt,<note place="margin">Hyl. Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move to each mans dwelling part of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him.</note> but where I
may be obnoctious to want, and to the States infliction of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,
when they ſhall take occaſion to repeat upon me any
thing which they ſhall call a crime, in reference to my
paſſed Actions for the late King, and my now Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign.</p>
                  <p>4. Right I can have none, unleſs I will damn my ſoul to
preſerve my eſtate, or repaire my wrong by a contra-legal and
contra-evangelical engagement.</p>
                  <p>This was ſufficient reaſon,<note place="margin">Declar. 17. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril 1646. Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance Non addr. in Jan. 1648.</note> owned and juſtified by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament

                     </gap>,
by their Declarations, and Ordinances.</p>
                  <p>2. Fealty or perſonal engagement I have given none <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. I have not taken the Proteſtation of <hi>May</hi> 1642.</p>
                  <p>2. I have not taken the ſolemn Oath and Covenant, yet if
I had, I might have juſtified my Actions by them.</p>
                  <p>3. I have not taken the negative Oath, becauſe my oath of
Allegiance (from which no man can abſolve me) is a negative
to that, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="57" facs="tcp:54289:30"/>
4. I have not taken the preſent engagement, much more
againſt my oath of Allegiance then the negative oath.</p>
                  <p>If I had had ſo little conſcience as to have taken them, I
would have had ſo much as to have kept them; and the State
cannot in reaſon expect from me, or any other, that we ſhould
take a ſecond, when we ſee no conſcience made of keeping the
firſt; and to take a third, the firſt and ſecond being broken,
without other diſpenſation then Power, which like <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
ſword cuts the<note n="*" place="margin">Gordian.</note> knot which it can not untye.</p>
                  <p>Neither hath any man aſſurance, if he ſhould take the laſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement,
that he ſhould have liberty to keep it longer then the
fancie of the State held to the now new faſhion of Government.</p>
                  <p>And therefore I ſtand clear as a down-right ſubject of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
to ſtand or fall by the Common Laws of <hi>England;</hi> and
if they will deny me that, they deny my Birth-right, which is
equally righteous, and no more juſt, then to deny me my
eſtate, my calling, my abode, my means of right-</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As to my action at <hi>Linton,</hi> I juſtifie my ſelf by
the late.</p>

and what I did was in order to his enlargement from
his Thraldome, and reſtorement to his lawfull power, which
was that to which my duty as a Subject by my oath of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance
did bind me in general termes, and the duty of my qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification
in particular obligation.</p>
                  <p>It was done before the now reputed Parliament were, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to be the Supreme Authority of the Nation, or had aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
the power of Government, or were fram'd into a State, &amp;
conſequently I am not anſwerable to them for any oppoſition
to them, further then the Common Law binds to Parliaments
without their head, &amp; hand, or defective in their members; &amp; as
to ſuch offence (if it be one) this Court is not qualified to take
any cognizance.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Col. Gibſons Caſe in 2. war at the Caſtles in Kent.</note> As to the deſign concerning the ſurpriſe of the Iſle
of <hi>Ely,</hi> it was but a bare diſcourſe or communication, and no

formal deſign ſaid, agreed unto, nor perſon engaged in it, ſo
much as by promiſe.</p>
                  <p>And in Caſes of conſpiracy againſt the lives of Kings, there
were ſome ſtatutes made, that very words and communication
ſhould be reputed I reaſon; but all repealed, or expired.</p>

                  <p>If in the higheſt point of treaſon, communication be not trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
againſt lawful Princes, certainly, an affection where the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
(ſuch as it is) is of a far inferiour nature of it ſelf, ſo it had a
far inferior object, or ſubject concerning whom ſuch diſcourſe
was holden.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, As to my ſuppoſed correſponding with the King,
the Lord <hi>Hopton</hi> and Earle of <hi>Cleveland,</hi> (if true) it was ſo long
ſince, as that it fals not within compaſe of this Courts Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion

confeſſed it, which was more their needed, to them who knew it
without enquiry; for I dare averr, that they had their inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
by them imployed, and cheriſht in betraying me to it.</p>
                  <p>And have ſome years paſt had a man in my boſome to watch

                        <item>1. It conſiſts of an oath of ſecreſie.</item>
                        <item>2. An owning of <hi>Charles</hi> the Second to be ſuch.</item>
                        <item>3. A reſolution to endeavour to make him ſuch,</item>

                  </p>

the co-engagers in that reſolution,<note place="margin">Theſe two will interweave.</note> &amp; the reſolution it ſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not Treaſon, the oath of keeping ſecret that reſolution is not
greater then the thing reſolved.</p>
                  <p>1. The thing reſolv'd was to endeavour, but was nor an
actual endeavoring.</p>
                  <p>2. If it were an actual endeavouring, yet it can only be
ſuppoſed, that it muſt be endeavoured by a warr to be levied;
and the endeavour to levy a warr never actually leavyed, is
not treaſon againſt the King, againſt whom only, and his relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
by our old laws, which are Laws, a treaſon can be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted;
and petty-treaſon I am not accuſed for.</p>
                  <p>That a bare intention,<note place="margin">Cook. 3. p. Inſt. fo. 14. and 38.</note> reſolution, or engagement to levy a
warr is not treaſon, I report my ſelf to my Lord <hi>Cooke;</hi> who
tels us, (and he is a man of credit) in his Book (printed
and allowed for law by the Houſes when they were two) that
a conſpiracy (and this engagement amounts not to ſo much,
but rather to an intention only to conſpire) to raiſe a warr,
(as hath been ſaid, and ſo reſolv'd) is no treaſon by the Act of
<hi>Edward</hi> the third,<note place="margin">25. Ed. 3. Ca. 2.</note> until the warr levyed, as within, or to be
reached by thoſe words in that law, (<hi>overt Act;</hi>) and if it
were not treaſon in thoſe words in the original, it fals not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the words of the tranſlation of this new born law <hi>viz.</hi> by
any <hi>open deed.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Open deed.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>So as the firſt and third branches of the engagement which
are interwoven, and what ever, I conclude that neither of them,
that is to ſay, neither the oath, nor the reſolution, are treaſons
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:54289:32"/>
either within the old, or the new laws, either in reſpect of the
perſons againſt whom, or the progreſs made in the thing it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>2. As to the owning of <hi>Charls</hi> the ſecond, it falls not within
your Law; for that it is not a Publiſhing, Proclaiming, or
publickly Declaring his Title; The words of the Act are,
[<hi>Proclaim, Declare, Publiſh, or any way promote</hi>] which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting
is matter of Action more then a private owning.<note place="margin">30 Jan. 1648.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this by the Oath it ſelf was not to be publiſht, nor could,
without publiſhing the Engagement it ſelf, which was contrary
to the Oath.</p>
                  <p>And though it may be objected, that the raiſing the warr
could not be done, but by a publiſhing his title, and the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement
at laſt; yet that, if it be granted, was no forwarder then
in intendment; no more was this publiſhing, and being not done,
falls not within your Act.</p>
                  <p>The crimination of the State is but gueſſed at by implication
(for they are not named) to be meant, and I believe your law
reaches only to things literal, and not conſtructive only; and for
the word Rebels, I hope they will not take that to themſelves,
and the word oppoſers is a very innocent expreſſion, and at the
worſt is all but a ſcandal.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Be this Engagement what it will, yet the terms upon
which I ſigned and ſealed it were ſuch, as that it was my act
not abſolute, but upon condition, and to be undone and avoided, in
caſe of the <hi>non-coengaging</hi> of others, by the States decoy aſſured
to be ready to do it; and at whoſe inſtance, and for whoſe ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
it was pretended to be deſired at my hands.</p>
                  <p>If the Court proceeds by way of Indictment, then I ſhall
move, that thoſe perſons may be confronted, whom in my Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative,
Examinations and Letters I have named; and that I may
demand of them, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>As alſo that Major <hi>Parker</hi> may be produced to be likewiſe
demanded of as a perſon by me lately, and ſince my papers ſent
to the State, diſcovered to be of the Plot to betray me.</p>
                  <p>If the Court proceed by way of Articles, and upon Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations
taken againſt me; I deſire, and that is but reaſon,
that I may examine, my defence, as in all Courts, where ſuch

ſake to forgive me my many and enormous tranſgreſſions; and
do lay down my life, (though under his preſent wrath, yet)
with a ſober confidence of his reſerved favour: And deſire

Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> there with him to expect a
joyful Reſurrection, at the comming of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to Judgment;
of which through his merits, and through them only, I am
right well aſſured.</p>
               <p>I beſeech God to bleſs my Daughter <hi>Matilda Andrewe,</hi>
and to ſupply unto her, what by my improvidence, (&amp; the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
of the late tempeſtuous times, in which I could not ſwim
to Riches without the drowning of my conſcience,) is in my
being taken away become deficient; and that he would preſerve
her from want, and diſhonor, and from being by any evil
Counſel or Example led aſide into the foul errors of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in matters concerning her Souls health. And to that end, I
hereby give her and the whole world an account of that faith
and profeſſion, wherein by Gods aſſiſtance I ſhall be found at
my death, and ſhall ſeal with my blood; and in which I pray
to God, ſhe, and all my dear friends (whom I ſpare to name,
becauſe I love them) may live and die.</p>
               <p>I renounce all dependance upon the <hi>Pope</hi> and Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> and that out of a ſerious conſideration of their adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate
errors and doctrines, inconſiſtant with the truth and light
of the Goſpel; and not meerly out of habit, as being bred a
Proteſtant, nor out of the general noyſe now made againſt them,
as if all the evil in the Land were from them: For ſo abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
have been the actions of the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> on the one ſide,
and the <hi>Sectarians</hi> on the other, that if I had not both found
my conſcience and judgment unſatisfied in the the Romiſh Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and my ſoul comforted in hope of Gods returning in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to his late mutilated Church, I had long ſince profeſt my

               <p>

I have hitherto liv'd, and reſolve (by Gods gracious aid) to

and profeſſor of that faith, and obedient to that diſcipline
which hath been profeſſed, and maintained, and exerciſed in
<hi>England,</hi> in the reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> King <hi>James,</hi> and
<hi>Charles</hi> the Martyr; which I truſt God will again reſtore to its
former purity and power.</p>
               <p>I look upon the Presbyterian, as upon one whoſe diſcipline
is inconſiſtent with, and improper for the natural and long
habituated Government of this Kingdome and Church, and
the Author of all this Lands miſcheifs, in the ſupplanting that
ancient and Apoſtolical Governance by Biſhops, and the taking
away of the life of the King, by expoſing him to the madneſs of
the Independent, by their firſt opening the gap to Anarchy and
confuſion in Church and State, by breaking the Golden Chain
of either due prerogative.</p>
               <p>I conſider the Independent, as fire out its place, which is
alwayes miſchievous; who hath already given earneſt (in his
making a ſuperſtructure upon the Presbyterians baſis,) for his
performing the whole work of confuſion upon Religion and
Law, if God prevent not by confounding their politick Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,
as much as themſelves have done their Fanatick opinions:
God in his good time put a hook in their noſtrils, and their <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viathans.</hi>

               <p>Of thoſe to whom I am any wayes indebted, I ask their pardon,
it not being my intendment, in caſe God had pleaſ'd to have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
me from the ſnare and violence under which I am fallen,
to have been (to my power) irreſponſible to any.</p>
               <p>I deſire ſuch who approve my profeſſion, to cover my faults in
their charity, and to let me be ſweet in their memory. As for
the reſt, I wiſh them a ſeaſonable repentance, but ſet no price

my councel; while I am not able to do what I would, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of what I can.</p>
               <p>I hope I ſhall not need divert your thoughts from the fears
and terrors of death; you are too well acquainted with that
Monſter, to ſhrink at his menaces; you know the Statute,
<hi>All men once to die;</hi> your death is accellerated by the malicious
machinations of a bad man, under the name of friend; if he
had not betrayed you, a Feaver, or other violent diſeaſe, or 1000.
other miſchiefs would have done it; a few inches of time are
cut from your life, be not you offended to haſten to your im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality;
you would have been glad to have been freed from
your priſon, let not your ſoul be clouded while it haſtens to
its glory; do not look to the next cauſes of ſuffering, ſo
much as to that providence which orders all things wiſely to the
glory of his name, and the ſalvation of your ſoul. (I atteſt your
own conſcience) Had you died under the bloody hand of War,
or in the height and heat of your youthfull aberrations, could
you have appeared ſo chearfully before the great Tribunal, as
now in this time of humiliation and preparation you may?
May be, the unworthy condition of your betrayer, works your
diſpoſitions to high indignations; yet your dear Saviour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed
by as great a pretender, ſaid no more, but, <hi>Doſt thou
betray me with a kiſs?</hi> Strange way it was (then,) but from
that arch-traytors example, its now become familiar; Do
not entertain animoſities againſt your Judges; you know who
ſaid, <hi>Father forgive them.</hi> And that great Martyr (dying,)
<hi>Lord lay not this to their charge.</hi> Be aſſured they muſt (one
day) give an account of your ſentence, before an higher Court
of Juſtice. If they have rightly judged, complain not; If
they have done you wrong, you know to whom vengeance
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:54289:35"/>
belongeth (ſhortly:) In your patience, poſſeſs your ſoul that
time you have to live, abandoning all thoughts and eares of this
world; ſtudy how to appear before the judgment ſeat of Chriſt,
to give account for your 42 years; conſider what anſwer to
make to that Judg which renders to every man according to
his works; let all your diſquiſition be, what to do to obtain Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Life.</p>
               <p>Much I have to ſay to that queſtion; Reduce all to theſe two,
thoſe two ways which Almighty God has chalk'd out for all
men to Eternal Glory. One of innocency; the fathers before
the flood had none other, thoſe after were directed by that;
Our bleſſed Saviour reſolves that queſtion, <hi>What's written in the
Law, that do, and thou ſhalt live.</hi> Conſider firſt, how far or
right you have walked in this way; but if you perceive your
aberrations, deſpair not; our good God has propounded a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
way unto that end; it's humble penitence; If you have
erred from that good way, come into this; Repent you truly
for all your ſins; Afflict your ſoul for offending your mercifull
Father; Implore his pitty, mercy and pardon, and your Soul
ſhall live. Remember you have a moſt gracious God, <hi>That
deſires not the death of a Sinner, but rather that he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
and live.</hi> You have a bleſſed Mediator, Interceſſor, Saviour,
who dyed for your ſins, and roſe again for your Juſtification;
and be aſſured, <hi>Whoſoever believeth in him ſhall not periſh;</hi> be
confident, he <hi>that believeth on him, ſhall live though he
die;</hi> and he <hi>that liveth and believeth on him, ſhall not die Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I am ſtraitned, while I would direct you in all the ſteps
of this way, which are humble Confeſſion, hearty Contrition,
ſerious Deteſtation, and (ſo far as you are able) real Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
Theſe four.</p>
               <p>I have already exceeded the limits of an Epiſtle; what is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
I ſhall beſeech you to make your addreſſes to the moſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and reverend Biſhop of <hi>Ely;</hi> intreat his help and direction,
follow his counſel, implore his abſolution, and conſider how
much gain it ſhould be to you, though you loſe all the world,
ſo your Soul may be ſaved.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:54289:36"/>
The God of all goodneſs in mercy look upon you, direct
you by his Wiſdom, guide you by his Counſell, comfort and
ſanctifie you by his holy Spririt, that alone ſhall make you
wiſe unto Salvation, and lead you through all the miſeries of
a perplexed life and untimely death, to that glory which is
beyond my expreſſion and your apprehenſion, is the daily

not been unprevailing; and which he doth now exerciſe upon
me, becauſe he is reſolved not to let me be leſs then a ſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved;
and I am content to bear the ſtripes, and kiſs the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument.</p>
               <p>I am ſorry that my rod is bound together with the ſin of my
betrayer, and wiſh him repentance, that when the Rod comes
to be burn'd, he ſuffer not in the flame. I ſhall not need to
ſay I forgive either him, or my Judges, having already forgotten
them in all, my prayers excepted.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:54289:36"/>
I am proud and covetous to be releaſed from the double im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment
I lie under, of the fleſh, and bonds, and am rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
for the opportunity to make my eſcape, though in a fiery
Chariot. All things betwixt me and God are removed from
my ſight, and I ſee him clearly without reflection upon my
accuſers and Judges, and ſubmit cheerfully to his fatherly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation
and judgment.</p>
               <p>It is Gods mercy that I was not long ſince conſumed; for an
earlier death, in my heats and follies, had not proved leſs
then a total conſumption of all, which now will become pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
in deſpight of ignominious Death, or attending nauſeous
Corruption.</p>
               <p>My betrayer wanted only <hi>Judas</hi> his ſubject to make his ſin
as great, being tranſcendent to his in the circumſtance; and
I wiſh him <hi>Peters</hi> tears to waſh away <hi>Judas</hi> guilt, and to avoid
<hi>Judas</hi> his puniſhment, by <hi>Peters</hi> repentance.</p>
               <p>My Judges have done me no wrong; they have a law for
their warrant, and my confeſſion for their evidence; neither
have capacity to be Chancellors in matters of life; let
them go free, and the Law-makers and inforcers of it, for their
errors of conſtituting them, before the padling in blood grow too
cuſtomary to be thought a ſin worthy their confeſſion or ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row;
which I deſire for the ſakes of their ſouls, and the lives
of the oppreſſed, and indeed proſcribed Free-Chriſtians of the
Nation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Fathers Plea of Innocence</hi> I cannot make, but I can ſay,
(and bleſs God that I can ſay) <hi>Veri penitence eſt pene innocence;</hi>
I have erred, and cannot ſay I have voluntarily returned, but
I am graciouſly brought home, as a loſt ſheep, not to be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
ſlaughtered, but put again amongſt the flock, to be kept
ſafe under the ſtaff, as well as the rod, for the great ſhepherd of
my ſoul Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
               <p>I dare not tell you I have not ſinned, you are a witneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
me, if I had none within me; but I can tell you what my
faith dictates to me, and Gods holy Spirit aſſures me, that the
Lord hath put away my iniquity.</p>
               <p>I am already ſenſible (and that in a meaſure unexpreſſable)
of Gods goodneſs to me; who as he will be glorified upon me
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:54289:37"/>
on earth, ſo he hath given me an earneſt of my future glory in
heaven, by the ſweet perfume he hath caſt upon my name a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the people, and the Chriſtian-like compaſſion he hath
begotten for me amongſt all men, who have yet an eye of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation
upon his return in mercy to this poor diſtreſſed Nation,
and oppreſſed People. The God of all goodneſs hath in mercy
looked upon me, directed me, counſel'd me, comforted me,
and ſanctified my affliction to me; and I am ready to fall into
his mercifull hands, as ſoon as the heavy hand of the Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

               </head>
               <p>THe Lieutenant of the Tower delivering the Colonel to the
Sheriff, ſaid, he had brought him thus far on his journey;
The Col. replied, I hope I ſhall neyther tyre in the way, nor

I hope there is no more but this block between me and heaven.

               <sp>
                  <p>Chriſtian Gentlemen and good people, your buſineſs hither
this day is to ſee a ſad Spectacle, a man brought in a moment
to be unmann'd, cut off in the prime of his years, taken from
further opportunity of doing ſervice to himſelf, his friends, the
Common-wealth, or eſpecially to God. It ſeldom happens
but upon very great cauſe; and though (truly) if my ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
known courſe of life were enquired into, I may mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly
ſay, there is ſuch a moral honeſty, as ſome may be ſo
forward as to expoſtulate, why this great judgment is fallen upon
me? But know, I am able to give them and my ſelf an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer;
and out of this breſt, to give a better account of my
Judgment and Execution, then my Judges themſelves, or you.
It's Gods juſt diſpleaſure towards me, for my ſins long unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
of; many judgments withſtood, and mercies ſlighted;
therefore doth my gracious father chaſtiſe me with this corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
that he may not loſe me; and I pray you aſſiſt me with
your prayers, that this rod may not be fruitleſs: That when
under his rod I have laid down my life, by his ſtaff I may be
comforted, and received into Glory.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="72" facs="tcp:54289:38"/>
I am very confident, by what I have heard ſince my ſentence,
there is more exceptions made againſt the proceedings againſt
men, then ever I made; my Tryers had a Law, and the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
of that Law is indiſputable for me to ſay againſt it, or to
make a queſtion of it: I ſhould but ſhame my ſelf and my
diſcretion: In the ſtrictneſs of the Law, ſomething is
done by me, that is applyable to ſome clauſe therein, by which I
ſtand condemned; the means by which I was brought under
that interpretation of that which was not in my ſelf intended
maliciouſly, being teſtimony given by perſons whom I pitty, ſo
falſe, yet ſo poſitive, that I cannot condemn my Judges for paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
Sentence againſt me, accorcing to legal juſtice; for equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
lies in higher breſts. For my accuſors, or rather betrayers, I
pitty, and am ſorry for them; they have committed <hi>Judas</hi> his
crime, I wiſh and pray for them, St <hi>Peters</hi> tears; and I wiſh
other people ſo happy, they may be taken up betimes, before
they have drunk more blood of Chriſtian men, poſſibly, leſs
deſerving then my ſelf.</p>
                  <p>It is true, there have been ſeveral addreſſes made for mercy,
and I will lay the obſtructions to nothing more then my own
ſins; and ſeeing God ſees it fit (I having not glorified him in my
life) I ſhall do it in my death, I am content.</p>
                  <p>I profeſs in the face of God, particular malice to any one of
the State or Parliament, to do them a perſonal injury, I had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
for the cauſe in which I had a great while waded, I muſt
ſay, my engagements and purſuance in it hath laid no ſcruple
upon my conſcience; it was upon principles of Law, whereof
I am a profeſſor, and upon principles of Religion, my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
rectified, and my conſcience ſatisfied, that I have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued
theſe wayes; for which (I bleſs God.) I find no black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
upon my conſcience, nor have I put into the bed-role of
my ſins.</p>
                  <p>I preſume not to decide controverſies, I deſire God to glorifie
himſelf in proſpering that ſide that hath right with it, and that
you may enjoy peace and plenty here, when I ſhall enjoy my
God.</p>
                  <p>In my converſation in the world, I do not know where I have
an enemy with cauſe, or that there is a perſon, to whom I have
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:54289:38"/>
regret; but if there be any whom I cannot recollect under the
notion of Chriſtian men, I pardon them as freely as if I had
named them; yea, I forgive all the world, as I deſire my hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Father for his Chriſt to forgive me.</p>
                  <p>For the buſineſs of Death, it is a ſad Sentence in it ſelf, if
men conſult with Fleſh and Blood: But (truly) without boaſting
I ſay it, or if I do boaſt, it is in the Lord, I have not to this
minute had one conſultation with Fleſh about the blow of the
Axe, or one thought of it, more then my paſport to Glory.</p>
                  <p>I take it as an honor, and I owe a thankfulneſs to thoſe under
whoſe power I am, that they have ſent me hither to a place,
however of puniſhment, yet of ſome honor, to dye a death
ſomewhat worthy my Blood; and this courteſie of theirs hath
much helped towards the ſatisfaction of my mind.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall deſire God, that thoſe Gentlemen in that ſad Bed-rol
to be tryed by the High Court of Juſtice, that they may find that
Really there, that is Nominal in the Act; <hi>An High Court of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
or Court of High Juſtice;</hi> High in its Righteouſneſs, not in
its Severity: no more clouded with the Teſtimony of folk that
ſell Blood for gain. <hi>Father forgive them, and I forgive them,
as I deſire thee to forgive me</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I deſire you now to pray for me, and not give over praying
until my laſt moment; that as I have a very great load of ſins,
ſo I may have the wings of your prayers aſſiſting thoſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
that ſhall conveigh my ſoul to Heaven. And I doubt not
but I ſhall there ſee my Bleſſed Saviour, and my gallant Maſter
the King of <hi>England,</hi> and another Maſter which I much honor,
my Lord <hi>Capel;</hi> hoping this day to ſee <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the preſence of
the Father, the King in the preſence of him, my Lord <hi>Capel</hi> in
the preſence of them all, and my ſelf with them, and all Saints,
to rejoyce for evermore.</p>

                  <p>You have this morning, in the preſence of a

                  <p>It is a queſtion of great length, requires a great time to

part with ſo heavenly an aſſociate: we have known one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

though I will not diminiſh you ſins, nor ſhall I conceal or hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrize
my own, for they are great ones between God and

wiſh them your repentance, and that meaſure of faith God hath
given you, and that meaſure of courage you have attained from

Here the Doctor prayed with him almoſt a quarter of an
hour, after which the Colonel turning himſelf again to the
people, ſpake as followeth;</p>
               <sp>
                  <p>One thing more I deſire to be clear in, There lyeth a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
imputation upon the Cavaliers, that they are Papiſts and
under that name we are made odious to thoſe of the contrary
opinion. I am not a Papiſt, but renounce the Pope with all
his dependencies, where the diſtractions in Religion firſt
ſprung up. I might have been thought apt to turn off from
this Church to the Romiſh, but was utterly unſatisfied in their
Doctrine in point of Faith, and very much as to their Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.
The Religion I Profeſs is that which paſſeth under
the name of <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> though that be rather a name of diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
then properly eſſential to Religion: but that Religion
found out in the Reformation, purged from all the Errors of
<hi>Rome</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, practiſed in the Reign
of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> King <hi>James</hi> and King <hi>Charles,</hi> that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Prince deceaſed; that Religion before it was defaced I am
off, which I take to be Chriſt's Catholick, though not the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Catholick Religion.</p>

               <p>There is none that looks upon me, though many faces, and
perhaps different from me in opinion and practice, but hath
ſomething of pity in it: And may that mercie that is in your
hearts, fall into your own boſomes when you have need of it:
And may you never find ſuch a block of ſin to ſtand in the
way of yout mercy as I have met with.</p>
               <p>I beſeech you joyn with me in Prayer. Then he prayed,
