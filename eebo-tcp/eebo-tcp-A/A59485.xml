            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The Earl of Shaftsburys Speech in the House
of Lords, upon the Debate of appointing a
day for the hearing Dr. Shirleys Cause,
<date>the 20th of October, 1675.</date>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My Lords,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>OUr All is at Stake, and therefore You must give me
leave to speak freely before We part with it. My
Lord Bishop of <hi>Salisbury</hi> is of Opinion, <hi>that we
should rather appoint a day to consider what to do upon the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition;
then to appoint a day of hearing:</hi> And my <hi>Lord Keeper,</hi>
for I may name them at a Committee of the whole House
tell's Us in very Eloquent and Studied Language. <hi>That he
will Propose Vs a way far less lyable to Exception, and much
less Offensive and Injurious to our own Priviledges, then that
of appointing a day of Heariug.</hi> And I beseech Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships,
did you not after all these fine Words expect some
Admirable Proposal! but it ended in this. <hi>That Your
Lordships should appoint a day, nay a very long day to Consider
what You would do in it:</hi> And my Lord hath undertaken to
convince you, that this is Your only Course by several un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyable
Reasons; the first of which is: <hi>That 'tis against
your Iudicature to heare this Cause which is not proper before
Vs, nor ought to be relieved by Vs.</hi> To this my Lords
give me leave to Answer, that I did not expect from a man
Professing the Law; that after an Answer by Orders of the
Court was put in, and a day had been appointed for Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
which by some Accident was set aside, and the Plaintiffe
moving for a second day to be assigned that ever without
hearing Counsel on both sides; the Court did enter into the
Merits of the Cause. And if your Lordships should do it
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52225:3"/>
here in a Cause attended with the Circumstances this is, it
would not only be an apparent Injustice, but a plain <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfuge</hi>
to avoid a Point you durst not maintain.</p>
            <p>But my Lords second Reason speaks the Matter more
clearly, for that is: <hi>Because 'tis a doubtful case, whether the
Commons have not Priviledge,</hi> and therefore my Lord would
have You, <hi>To appoint a farther and a very long day to consider
of it,</hi> which in plain English is, that Your Lordships should
confess upon Your Books, that you conceive it on second
Thoughts a doubtful Case, for so Your <hi>Appointing a day to
Consider</hi> will do, and that for no other Reason, but because
my Lord <hi>Keeper</hi> thinks it so, which I hope will not be a
Reason to prevail with Your Lordships; since we cannot
yet by experience tell that his Lordship is capable of think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Your Lordships in the Right, in any Matter against the
<hi>Iudgement</hi> of the <hi>House of Commons;</hi> 'tis so hard a thing even
for the ablest of men to change ill Habits.</p>
            <p>But my Lords third Reason, is the most Admirable of all
which he Stiles <hi>Vnanswerable,</hi> viz. <hi>That Your Lordships are all
convinced in Your Consciences that this (if prosecuted) will cause
a Breach.</hi> I beseech Your Lordships, consider whether this
Argument thus applyed would not overthrow the Law of
Nature, and all the Laws of Right and Property in the
World: For 'tis an Argument, and a very good one, that
You should not stand or insist on Claims, where You have
not a clear Right; or where the Question is not of Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
and of Moment, in a Matter that may produce a
Dangerous Pernitious Breach between Relations, Persons,
Bodies politick joyn'd in Interest, and High Concerns toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
So on the other hand, if the Obstinacy of the Party
in the wrong, shall be made an unanswerable Argument for
the other Party to recede and give up his just Rights. How
long shall the People keep their Liberties, or the Princes
or Governours of the World their Prerogatives! How
long shall the Husband maintain his dominion, or any man
his Property from his Friend, or his Neighbours Obstinacy?
But my Lords when I hear my Lord <hi>Keeper</hi> open so Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<hi>the Fatal Consequences of a Breach:</hi> I cannot forbear
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52225:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to fall into some admiration how it comes to pass: That (if
the <hi>Consequences be so fatall)</hi> the Kings Ministers in the
House of <hi>Commons,</hi> of which there are several that are of the
<hi>Cabinet,</hi> and have dayly resort to His <hi>Majesty,</hi> and have the
Direction and Trust of his Affaires: I say that none of hese
should press these Consequences there, or give the least
stop to the Carreer of that House in this Business; but that
all the Votes concerning this Affair, nay even that very
Vote, <hi>That no Appeal from any Court of Equity is cognisable
by the House of Lords,</hi> should pass <hi>nemine contradicente.</hi> And
yet all the great Ministers with us here, the <hi>Bishops</hi> and
other <hi>Lords</hi> of dependance on the Court contend this point,
as if it were <hi>pro Aris &amp; focis.</hi> I hear His <hi>Majesty</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi>
hath been pleased to declare against <hi>Appeals in Parliament,</hi>
I cannot much blame the Court if they think (the <hi>Lord
Keeper,</hi> and the <hi>Iudges</hi> being of the <hi>Kings</hi> Naming, and in
His Power to change) that the Justice of the Nation is safe
enough, and I my <hi>Lord</hi> think so too, during this <hi>Kings</hi>
time, though I hear <hi>Scotland</hi> not without reason complain
already: Yet how future <hi>Princes</hi> may use this Power, and
how <hi>Iudges</hi> may be made not men of Ability or Integrity,
but men of Relation and Dependance, and who will do
what they are commanded; and all mens Causes come to be
Judged, and Estates disposed on as Great Men at Court
please.</p>
            <p>My <hi>Lords,</hi> the Constitution of your Government hath
provided better for Us, and I can never believe so Wise a
Body as the <hi>House of Commons,</hi> will prove that Foolish wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
which plucks down her House with her hands.</p>
            <p>My <hi>Lords,</hi> I must presume in the next place to say som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to what was offered by my <hi>Lord Bishop of Salsburye,</hi> a
man of Great Learning and Abilities, and always versed in
a stronger and closer way of Reasoning, then the Business
of that Noble <hi>Lord</hi> I answered before did accustome him
too, and that Reverend <hi>Prelate</hi> hath stated the Matter very
sair upon two Heads.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The first,</hi> whether the hearing of Causes and Appeals, and
especially in this Point where the Members have priviledge,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52225:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
be so Material to us, that it ought not to give way to the Reason
of State, of greater Affairs that pressed us at the time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The second was,</hi> If this Business be of that Moment, yet whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the appointing a day to consider of this Petition; would
prove of that consequence, and prejudice to your Cause.</p>
            <p>My <hi>Lords,</hi> to these give me leave in the first place to say,
that this Matter is no less then Your whole <hi>Iudicature,</hi>
and Your <hi>Iudicature</hi> is the life and soul of the Dignity of
the <hi>Peerage of England,</hi> you will quickly grow burdensome,
if you grow useless, you have now the greatest and most
useful end of <hi>Parliament</hi> principally in you, which is not to
make new Laws but to redress Grievances, and to Maintain
the Old Land-Marks. The <hi>House of Commons</hi> Business is to
complain, Your <hi>Lordships</hi> to redress, not only the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
from them that are the Eyes of the Nation, but all
other particular persons that address to You. A Land
may Groan under a Multitude of Quarrels I believe Ours
does, and when Laws grow so multiplyed, they prove oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
Snares, then Directions and Security to the People. I
look upon it as the ignorance and weakness of the latter
Age, if not worse, the effect of the Designes of ill men; that
it is grown a general opinion, that where there is not a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
direction in some <hi>Act of Parliament</hi> the Law is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective,
as if the <hi>Common Law</hi> had not provided much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
Shorter, and Plainer for the Peace and Quiet of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
then intricate, long, and perplexed <hi>Statutes</hi> do:
which has made Work for the <hi>Lawyers,</hi> given power to the
<hi>Iudges,</hi> lessened Your Lordships Power, and in a good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
unhinged the security of the People.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lord Bishop</hi> tells You, <hi>That Your whole Iudicature is not
in question, but only the priviledge of the House of Commons, of
their Members not appearing at Your Barr:</hi> My Lords, were it
not no more, yet <hi>that</hi> for Justice and the Peoples sake You
ought not to part with: How far a Priviledge of a <hi>House of
Commons,</hi> their Servants, and those they own, doth extend
<hi>Westminster Hall,</hi> may with Griefe tell Your <hi>Lordships.</hi> And
the same Priviledge of their Members being not sued, must
be allowed by Your <hi>Lordships,</hi> as well, and what a failer of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52225:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Justice this would prove whilst they are <hi>Lords</hi> for life, and
you for Inheritance, let the World Judge; for my part I
am willing to come to Conference when ever the Dispute
shall begin again, and dare undertake to your <hi>Lordships,</hi>
that they have neither President, Reason, nor any Justifiable
pretence to show against us; and therefore my <hi>Lords,</hi> if you
part with this undoubted Right meerly for the asking,
where will the asking stop! And my <hi>Lords,</hi> we are sure it doth
not stop here, for have they already <hi>nemine Contradicente!</hi>
Voted against <hi>Your Lordships power of Appeals from any Court
of Equity!</hi> so that you may plainly see where this Caution
and reason of State means to stop, not one jot short of lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your whole Judicature aside, for the same reason of
passing the Kings Money, of not interrupting good Laws,
or what ever else must of ncessity avoid all Breach upon
what score soever: And your <hi>Lordships</hi> plainly see the
Breach will be as well made upon Judicature in general as
upon this, so that when your <hi>Lordships</hi> have appointed
a day; a very long day, or to consider whether Dr. <hi>Shirleys</hi>
Cause be not too hot to handle. And when you have done
the same for Sir <hi>Nicholas Stanton</hi> whose Petition I here is
coming in, your <hi>Lordships</hi> must proceed to a Vote <hi>to lay all
private Business aside for six Weeks,</hi> for that Phrase of private
Business hath obtained upon this last Age, upon that which
is your most publique Duty and Business; namely the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration
of Justice. And I can tell your <hi>Lordships,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the reason that tends to it, that I have some intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
of the designing such a Vote: For on the second day
of your sitting, at the rising of the <hi>Lords House</hi> there came a
Gentleman into the Lobby belonging to a very great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and askt in great haste <hi>are the Lords up? have they passed
the Vote?</hi> and being ask't what Vote? He answered <hi>the Vote
of no Private Business for six Weeks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My <hi>Lords,</hi> if this be your Business, see where you are, if ye
are to Postpone our Judicature for fear of offending the
<hi>House of Commons</hi> for six Weeks; that they in the <hi>interim</hi>
may passe the <hi>Money,</hi> and other acceptable Bills that His
<hi>Majesty</hi> thinks of Importance; are so many wise men in the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52225:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Commons</hi> to be laid asleep, and to pass all these
acceptable things, when they have done, to let us to be

you; after you have asserted but the last <hi>Session</hi> your worst
of Judicature, so highly even in this Point, and after the
<hi>House of Commons</hi> had gone so high against you on the other
hand, as to post up their <hi>Declaration</hi> and <hi>Remonstrances</hi> on
<hi>Westminster Hall Doors,</hi> the very next <hi>Session</hi> after you post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pone
the very same Causes, and not only those, but all
Judicatures whatever. I beseech your <hi>Lordships,</hi> will not this
prove a fatal president and confession against your selves?
'Tis a Maxim, and a rational one amongst Lawyers, <hi>that one
President where the Case hath been Contested, is worth a 1000
where there hath been no Contest:</hi> My Lords, in saying this
I humbly suppose I have given a sufficient answer to my
<hi>Lord Bishops</hi> second Question; <hi>Whether the appointing a day
to consider what you will do with this Petition be of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
to your right,</hi> for it is a plain confession, that it is
a doubtful Case, and that infinitely stronger then if it were a
new thing to you never heard of before; For it is the very
same <hi>Case,</hi> and the very same thing desired in that <hi>Case,</hi>
that you formerly ordered and so strongly asserted; so that
upon time, and all the deliberation imaginable, you declared
your selves to become doubtful, and you put your selves out
of your own hands, into that power that you have no reason
to believe on your side in this Question.</p>
            <p>My Lords, I have all the duty imaginable to his <hi>Majesty,</hi>
and should withall submission give way to any thing that
he should think of Importance to his affairs: But in this
Point it is to alter the constitution of the <hi>Government,</hi> if
you are ask't to lay this aside; And there is no reason of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52225:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
can be an Argument to your <hi>Lordships</hi> to turn your selves
out of that Interest you have in the constitution of the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi>
'tis not only your concern that you maintain
your selves in't, but 'tis the concern of the Poorest man in
<hi>England</hi> that you keep your Station: 'Tis your <hi>Lordiships</hi>
concern, and that so highly, that I will be bold to say the
<hi>King</hi> can give none of you a requital or recompence for it,
what are empty Titles? What is present Power, or Riches
and a great Estate, wherein I have no firme and fixed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty?
'Tis the constitution of the <hi>Government</hi> and Maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
it that secures your <hi>Lordships</hi> and every man else in what
he hath: The Poorest Lord, if the Birthright of the <hi>Peerage</hi>
be maintained, has a Fair Prospect before him for himself
or his Posterity: But the greatest Title with the greatest
present Power and Riches, is but a mean creature, and
maintains those absolute <hi>Monarchyes</hi> no otherwise then by
servile low flatteries and upon uncertain terms.</p>
            <p>My Lords, 'Tis not only your Interest, but the Interest of
the Nation that you Maintain your Rights, for let the <hi>House
of Commons</hi> and <hi>Gentry</hi> of <hi>England</hi> think what they please,
there is no <hi>Prince</hi> that ever governed without <hi>Nobility</hi> or an
<hi>Army:</hi> if you will not have one; you must have t'other, or
the <hi>Monarchy</hi> cannot long support, or keep it self from
tumbling into a <hi>Democratical Republique.</hi> Your <hi>Lordships</hi>
and people have the same cause, and the same Enemies. My
Lords, would you be in favour with the King? 'Tis a very
ill way to it, to put your selves out of a future capacity,
to be considerable in his service: I do not find in Story, or
in Modern Experience, but that 'tis better, and a man is
much more regarded that is in a capacity and opportunity to
serve, then he that hath wholly deprived himself of all for
his <hi>Princes</hi> service: And I therefore declare that I will serve
my <hi>Prince</hi> as a <hi>Peer,</hi> but will not destroy the <hi>Peerage</hi> to
serve him.</p>
            <p>My <hi>Lords,</hi> I have heard of 20. foolish Modells and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients
to secure the Justice of the Nation, and yet to take
this Right from your <hi>Lordships</hi> as the <hi>King</hi> by his <hi>Comm<gap reason="illegible: obscured" extent="2 letters">

take away your <hi>Lordships</hi> just Right, that ought not to be
altred any more then any other part of the <hi>Government,</hi> but
are in themselves when well weighed Ridiculous. I must
deal freely with your <hi>Lordships,</hi> these things could never
have risen in mens minds, but that there has been some kind
of Provocation that has given the first rise of it: Pray my
Lords forgive me, if on this occasion I put you in mind of
<hi>Committee Dinners,</hi> and the Scandal of it, those Droves of
Ladies that attended all Causes; 'twas come to that pass,
that men even Hired or Borrowed of their Friends handsom
Sisters or Daughters to deliver their Petitions: But yet for
this I must say, that your Judgments have been Sacred, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
in one or two Causes, <hi>Sir or, Whitehootes,</hi> the Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellers,
and those we owe most to that Bench; from whence
we now apprehend most danger.</p>
            <p>There is one thing I had almost forgot to speak to,
<hi>Which is the Conjuncture of time, the Hinge upon which your
reason of State turns;</hi> and to that my Lords give me leave
to say, if this be not a time of Leisure for you to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
your Priviledges, you must never expect one: I could
almost say that the Harmony, good Agreement, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
that is to be prayed for at most other times, may be
fatall to us now, we owe the Peace of this last two years
disingagement from the <hi>French</hi> interest to the two Houses
differing from the Sense and Opinion of <hi>Whitehall,</hi> so at
this time, the thing in the World this Nation hath most
reason to apprehend, is a General Peace, which cannot now
happen without very advantagious Terms to the <hi>French,</hi>
and Disadvantagious to the House of <hi>Austria:</hi> We are the
Kings great Counsellors and if so, have Right to differ, and
give contrary Councels to these few are nearest about him,
I fear they would advance a General Peace, I'me sure I
would advise against it, and hinder it at this time by all the
ways imaginable: I heartily wish nothing from you may add
weight and reputation to those Councels would assist the
<hi>French.</hi> No Money for Ships, nor Preparation you can
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52225:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
make, nor Personal assurances your Prince can have, can
secure us from the <hi>French</hi> if they are at leisure, he is grown
the most Potent of us all at <hi>Sea:</hi> He has Built 24. Ships
this last year; and has 30. more in number then we besides
the advantage that our Ships are all out of Order, and his
so exquisitely provided for, that every Ship has his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Store-house. 'Tis incredible the Money he hath, and
is bestowing in making Harbors, he makes nature it self give
way to the vastness of his Expence: And after all this shall
a Prince so Wise, so intent upon his affairs, be thought to
make all these preparations to Saile over Land, and fall on
the back of <hi>Hungary,</hi> and Batter the Walls of <hi>Kaminit'z,</hi>
or is it possible he should oversee his Interest in seizing of
<hi>Ireland,</hi> a thing so feasible to him, if he be master of the
Seas, as he certainly now is; and which when attained gives
him all the <hi>Southern, Mediteranian, East and West India Trade,</hi>
and renders him both Scituation and excellent Harbors, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
Master of the Seas without Dispute.</p>
            <p>My Lords to, conclude this point, I fear the Court of
<hi>England</hi> is greatly mistaken in it, and I do not wish them
the reputation of the concurrance of the Kingdom: And
this out of the most sincere Loyalty to his Majesty, and love
to my Nation.</p>
            <p>My Lords, I have but one thing more to trouble you
with, and that peradventure is a consideration of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
weight and concern, both to your Lordships, and the
whole Nation. I have often seen in this House, that the
Arguments, with strongest reason, and most convincing to
the Lay Lords in General, have not had the same effect upon
the Bishops Bench; but that they have unanimously gone
against us in matters, that many of us have thought Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
and undoubted Rights; And I consider, that 'tis not
possible, that Men of great Learning, Piety, and Reason,
as their Lordships are, should not have the same care of
doing right, and the same conviction, what is right upon
clear reason offered, that other your Lordships have. And
therefore, my Lords, I must necessarily think, we differ in
principles; And then 'tis very easie to apprehend what is
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52225:7"/>
the clearest sense to men of my principle, may not at all
perswade or affect the Conscience of the best man of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
one. I put your Lordships the case plainly, as 'tis
now before us. My principle is, <hi>That the King is King by
Law, and by the same Law that tbe poor Man enjoys his Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage;</hi>
and so it becomes the concern of every man in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
that has but his liberty, to maintain and defend, to
his utmost, the King in all his Rights and Prerogatives.
My Principle is also, <hi>That the Lords House, and the Iudica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and Rights belonging to it, are an Essential part of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi>
and Established by the same Law; The King
governing and administring Justice by His House of Lords,
and advising with both His Houses of Parliament in all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
matters, is the Government I own, am born under,
and am obliged to. If ever there should happen in future
ages (which God forbid) a King governing by an Army,
without his Parliament, 'tis a Government I own not, am
not obliged to, nor was born under. According to this
Principle, every honest man that holds it, must endeavour
equally to preserve the frame of the Government, in all the
parts of it, and cannot satisfie his Conscience to give up
the Lords House for the Service of the Crown, or to take
away the just rights and priviledges of the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
to please the Lords. But there is another Principle
got into the World, my Lords, that hath not been long
there; for Arch-Bishop <hi>Land</hi> was the first Author that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
of it: And I cannot find, that the Jesuites, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the Popish Clergy hath ever own'd it, but some of the
Episcopal Clergy of our <hi>British Isles;</hi> and 'tis withal, (as
'tis new<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) so the most dangerous destructive Doctrine to
our Government and Law, that ever was. 'Tis the first of
the Cannons published by the Convocation, 1640. <hi>That
Monarchy is of Divine Right.</hi> This Doctrine was then preached
up, and maintained by <hi>Sibthorp, Manwaring,</hi> and others,
and of later years, by a Book published by Dr. <hi>Sanderson,
Bishop of Lincoln,</hi> under the name of <hi>Arch-Bishop Vsher;</hi> and
how much it is spread amongst our Dignified Clergy, is
very easily known. We all agree, <hi>That the King and His
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52225:7"/>
Government, is to be obeyed for Conscience sake;</hi> and that the
Divine Precepts, require not onely here, but in all parts of
the World, <hi>Obedience to Lawful Governours.</hi> But that this
Family are our Kings, and this particular frame of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
is our lawful Constitution, and obliges us, is owing
onely to the particular Laws of our Country. This <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dean</hi>
Doctrine was the root that produced the <hi>Bill of Test</hi>
last <hi>Session,</hi> and some very perplexed Oaths that are of the
same nature with that, and yet imposed by several <hi>Acts of
this Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a word, if this Doctrine be true, our <hi>Magna Charta</hi>
is of no force, our Laws are but Rules amongst our selves
during the Kings pleasure. Monarchy, if of Divine Right,
cannot be bounded or limited by humane Laws, nay, whats
more, cannot bind it self; and All our Claims of right by
the Law, or Constitution of the Government, All the Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
and Priviledge of this House, All the Rights and
Priviledges of the House of Commons, All the Properties
and Liberties of the People, are to give way, not onely to
the interest, but the will and pleasure of the Crown. And
the best and worthyest of Men, holding this principle, must
Vote to deliver up all we have, not onely when reason of
State, and the separate Interest of the Crown require it,
but when the will and pleasure of the King is known, would
have it so. For that must be, to a man of that principle.
the onely rule and measure of Right and Justice. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
my Lords, you see how necessary it is, that our Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
be known and how fatal to us all it is, that this
Principle should he suffered to spread any further.</p>
            <p>My Lords, to conclude, your Lordships have seen of
what consequence this matter is to you, and that the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing
a day to consider, is no less then declaring your
selves doubtful, upon second and deliberate thoughts, that
you put your selves out of your own hands, into a more
then a moral probability, of haviug this Session made a
president against you. You see your Duty to your selves
and the People; and that 'tis really not the interest of the
<hi>House of Commons,</hi> but may be the inclination of the Court,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52225:8"/>
that you loose the Power of Appeals; but I beg our House
may not be <hi>Felo de se,</hi> but that your Lordships would take
in this affair, the onely course to preserve your selves, and
appoint a day, this day 3 weeks, for the hearing Dr. <hi>Shirloys</hi>
Cause, which is my humble motion.</p>

               <salute>My Lords,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THere is a thing called <hi>Property,</hi> (whatever
some men may think) <hi>that</hi> the People of
<hi>England</hi> are fondest <hi>of.</hi> It is <hi>that</hi> they will
never part with, and it is <hi>that</hi> His <hi>Majesty</hi> in
his <hi>Speech</hi> has promised to take particular
care of. <hi>This,</hi> my Lords, in my opinion,
can never be done, without an <hi>Indulgence to all Protestant dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is certainly a very uneasie kind of life to any man, that
has either Christian Charity, Good Nature, or Humanity,
to see his fellow <hi>Subjects</hi> daily abused, divested of their <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties</hi>
and <hi>Birth-rights,</hi> and miserably thrown out of their
<hi>Possessions</hi> and <hi>Free-holds,</hi> only because they cannot agree
with others in some <hi>Opinions</hi> and <hi>Niceties</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> which
their Consciences will not give them leave to consent to,
and, which even by the consent of those who would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
them, are no way necessary to Salvation.</p>
            <p>But my <hi>Lords,</hi> besides this, and all that may be said upon
it, in order to the improvement of our <hi>Trade,</hi> and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
of the <hi>Wealth, Strength,</hi> and <hi>Greatness</hi> of this <hi>Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
(which with your leave I shall presume to discourse of
at some other time) there is methinks in this Nation of
<hi>persecution,</hi> a very gross mistake, both as to the point of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi>
and <hi>Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is so; as to the point of <hi>Government,</hi> because it
makes every mans safety depend upon the wrong place,
not upon the <hi>Governors,</hi> or mans living well towards the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
<hi>Government,</hi> established by <hi>Law;</hi> but upon his being
transported with Zeal for every opinion that's held by those
that have power in the <hi>Church</hi> that's in fashion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:52225:9"/>
And I perceive it's a mistake in <hi>Religion,</hi> for that it is po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitively
against the express <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Example</hi> of <hi>Iesus
Christ;</hi> Nay, my <hi>Lords,</hi> as to our <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> there
is something yet worse; for we <hi>Protestants</hi> maintain, that
none of these <hi>Opinions</hi> which Christians here differ about,
are <hi>Infallible;</hi> and therefore in us it is somewhat an inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable
conception, that men ought to be deprived of their
Inheritance, and all their certain conveniencies and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
of Life, because they will not agree with us in our
uncertain <hi>Opinions</hi> of <hi>Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My humble motion to your <hi>Lordships</hi> therefore is, That
you will give me leave to bring in <hi>A Bill of Indulgence to all
dissenting Protestants.</hi> I know very well, that every <hi>Peer</hi> of
this <hi>Realm</hi> has a right to bring into <hi>Parliament</hi> any <hi>Bill</hi> which
he conceives to be useful to this Nation. But I thought it
more respectful to your <hi>Lordships</hi> to ask your leave for it
before; and I cannot think that doing of it, will be any
prejudice to the <hi>Bill,</hi> because I am confident, the <hi>Reason,</hi>
the <hi>Prudence,</hi> and the <hi>charitableness</hi> of it, will be able to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
it to this <hi>House,</hi> and the <hi>whole world.</hi>
            </p>

            <head>The Protestation, with Reasons of several Lords for the
Dissolution of this Parliament, entred in the Lords
Iournal, <date>November 22. 1675.</date> the day the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was Prorogued.</head>
            <p>WE whose names are under-written, Peers of this
Realm, having proposed, <hi>That an humble Address
might be made to His Majesty from this House, that he would be
graciously pleased to Dissolve this Parliament:</hi> And the House
having carryed it in the Negative, for the Justification of
our Loyal Intentions towards His Majesties Service, and of
our true respect and deference to this Honourable House;
and to shew that we had no sinister or indirect Ends in this
our humble proposal, Do with all humility herein<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> set forth
the grounds and reasons why we were of opinion that the
said <hi>humble Address</hi> should have been made.</p>
            <p>1. We do humbly conceive, that it is according to the
ancient Laws and Statutes of this Realm, that there should
be frequent and new Parliaments, and that the practice of
several years, hath been accordingly.</p>
            <p>2. It seems not reasonable; that any particular number of
Men, should for many years, ingross so great a trust of the
People, as to be their Representatives in the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons:
And all other the Gentry and the Members of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations
of the same degree and quality with them, should
be so long excluded. Neither, as we humbly conceive, is
it advantagious to the Government; that the Counties, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and Burroughs, should be confined for so long a time
to such Members as they have once chosen to serve for them.
The mutual correspondence and interests of those who
choose and are chosen, admitting of great variations in
length of time.</p>
            <p>3. The long continuance of any such as are intrusted for
others, and who have so great a power over the purse of the
Nation, must in our humble opinion, naturally endanger
the producing of Factions and Parties, and the carrying on
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52225:11"/>
of particular interests and designs, rather then the publick
Good.</p>
            <p>And we are the more confirmed in our desires for the said
humble Address, by reason of this unhappy breach fallen
out betwixt the two Houses of which the House of Peers
hath not given the least occasion; they having done nothing
but what their Ancestors and Predecessors have in all times
done; and what is according to their duty, and for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
of the people that they should do; which, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the House of Commons have proceeded in such an
unpresidented and extraordinary way, that it is in our hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
opinion, become altogether unpracticable for the two
Houses, as the Case stands, jointly to pursue these great and
good ends for which they were called.</p>
            <p>For these reasons We do enter this our Protestation against,
and dissent unto, the said Vote.</p>
