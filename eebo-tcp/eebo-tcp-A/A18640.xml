            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And that they may ſeeme to procure credit to themſelues, and to giue a check to the Germane Churches eſpeciallie, they bring forth both certeine other writings, and eſpeciallie that <hi>Forme</hi> of Agreement, of late pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in Germanie, in which there are certaine things to be ſeene farre differing from thoſe aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Confeſſions of Faith, which the Churches of the Goſpell haue euen ſince the beginning giuen out. But let them ſo thinke, that the fault of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie is not to be laide vpon thoſe, whoſe faith alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether relieth on moſte ſure grounds of ſcripture: that they are no ſchiſmatiques who intierly cleaue to Gods Church ſuch an one as the Prophets &amp; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles doe deſcribe vnto vs: nor to be accounted ſectaries, who embrace the truth of God, which is one and alwaies like it ſelfe. What doe they mean, I praie you, by the name of Confeſſioniſts ſo often repeated? For if euerie man be commaunded to make confeſſion of his Faith ſo often as Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and the edifying of the Church ſhall require;
<pb facs="tcp:8251:5"/>
what a wonderfull or ſtrange thing ought it to ſeeme, if Cities, if Prouinces, if wholl kingdomes haue made profeſſion of their faith, when they were falſely charged by the Popiſh ſorte, that they had gone from the doctrine of the true beleeuing Church? but they will ſaie, there ought to be one confeſſion of faith and no moe: as though for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth, a confeſſion of faith were to be valued ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the words, then by the thing it ſelfe. What therefore will they ſaie to our ancetours, who when they had the Apoſtles Creede, yet for all that ſet out the Nicene, Chalcedonian, and manie moe ſuch like Creedes? Thoſe Creedes, ſaie you, were generall. Yea ſurelie, but ſo generall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that a great part of the world in thoſe elder times follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the frantique hereſies of the Arrians, whom the godlie forefathers by ſetting forth thoſe Creedes deſired to bring home into the Church againe. <hi>The trueth,</hi> ſaith Hilarie, <hi>was by the aduiſe and opinions of Biſhops many waies ſought, &amp; a reaſon of that which was meant was rendered by ſeuerall confeſſions of faith ſet downe in writing:</hi> And a litle after. <hi>It ought to ſeeme no maruell right welbeloued breethren, that mens faiths began to be declared ſo thick: the outrage of heretiques laieth this neceſſitie vpon vs.</hi> Thus much ſaide Hilarie. What that Athanaſius, Auguſtine, and many other auncients ſet forth their Creedes alſo, that the puritie of Chriſtian faith might more and more ſhine ſorth. Therefore if Kingdoms, Cities, &amp; and whole prouinces haue priuatelie made confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their faith, this was the cauſe therof, for that hitherto the ſtate of times hath not ſuffered, that a generall Councell of all thoſe, who profeſſe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb facs="tcp:8251:5"/>
religion, might be holden. But if it once come to paſſe (and the Lord graunt that the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches maie at length inioy ſo great a benefit) then there may be one onelie confeſſion of faith extant, conceiued in the ſame wordes, if the ſtate of the Churches ſhal ſeeme to require it. Let them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore leaue of in mockage to terme vs Confeſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtes, vnles perhaps they looke for this anſwere at our hands, that it is a farre more excellent thing to beare a name of confeſſing the faith, then of deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the trueth. For euen as moe ſmal ſtreames may flow from one ſpring, ſo moe confeſſions of faith, may iſſue out from one and the ſame truth of faith.</p>
            <p>Now to ſpeake ſomewhat alſo of thoſe, who while they will ſeeme to embrace the trueth of the Goſpell, and renounce popiſh errours, ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues more vniuſt towards vs, then was meet they ſhould, we are compelled to finde want of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an charitie inthem. This one thing in deed was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, that after ſo many daungers, loſſes, baniſh ments, downefalles, woes without number, griefes and torments, we ſhould alſo be euill intreated by thoſe, of whome ſome comforte was rather to be looked for. But that ancient enimie of the Church is farre deceiued (by whoſe ſubtilties this euil is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo wrought for vs) while he hopeth that we ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e by his craftes be ouerwhelmed. But bearing our ſelues bolde on that loue, which the mercifull God through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord beareth vnto vs, and whoe hath planted a loue and feare of him in our mindes, we leape for ioye in theſe verie thinges, and boaſt with the Apoſtle, that it will neuer be, (the ſame grace of God alwaies preuenting vs) that
<pb facs="tcp:8251:6"/>

For we knowe that ſaying of Chryſoſtome to be true, <hi>It is not euill, to ſuffer; but to doe euill.</hi> Neither are we anie whit diſgraced hereby, but they whom I know not what diſtemperature whetteth againſt vs hauing deſerued nothing, &amp; to repaie them like for like, quitting rayling with rayling, far be it from vs, whom God vouchſafeth this honour, that being faſhioned like to the image of his Sonne we might through good reporte and euill reporte walke on, vpholden with the ſtaie of a good conſcience, yea we haue reſolued with our ſelues not only to abide the open wronges of our enimies, but euen the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine of our bretheren, although neuer ſo vniuſt.</p>
            <p>And what we furthermore think of the doctrine of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, the confeſſion of our faith, ſet forth manie yeares agoe, hath made it knowen to the wholl world: and we haue God, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells, together with men, witneſſes of that ſincere endeuour, by which we laboured, and doe as yet, to the vttermoſte of our power, labour to ſet vp againe and maintaine the pure worſhipe of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong vs out of Gods word.</p>
            <p>And, euen as we ſhewed our ſelues to be readie at all times to render a reaſon of the hope that is in vs: ſo we thought it a matter worth the paines, to make all men priuie to that bonde which one our parte is verie ſtraight with the holie and truelie Catholike Church of God, with euerie Saint and ſounde member thereof, that ſo farre as we c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

the Churches ioyned with vs from thoſe moſte greeuous crimes, by which ſome mens ſpeaches &amp; bookes are laid to our charge. And when we be thought our ſelues by what means it might beſt be done, this eſpeciallie for the preſent time ſeemed a meet waie vnto vs, which would giue offence to no man, &amp; might ſatisfie al that would yeald vnto rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, namelie to publiſh this <hi>Harmonie</hi> of confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whereby it might ſufficientlie be vnderſtood, howe falſelie we are charged, as though we, that haue reiected popiſh errors, agreed not at al among our ſelues. For (to beginne with thoſe ſtout main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers of the Romiſh tyranny, who wil yet ſeeme to be defenders of the truth, this conference of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions will plucke euery viſard from their faces, when as itſhal plainely appeere, that al the opinions in theſe confeſſions of faith were in other ſondrie words ſo laid down, that yet the ſame truth alwaies abideth, &amp; there is none at al, or very litle difference in the thinges themſelues. And how narrow muſt they needs perceiue the boundes of that their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Churche to be, when it ſhalbe openlie knowen, that ſo many kingdomes, prouinces, ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, peoples, &amp; nations profeſſing the truth of the Goſpell, doe with common conſent renounce the abuſes and orders of the Romiſh Church? As for thoſe whome (without anie deſert) it pleaſeth to count vs among the Arrians and Turkes, they ſhal ſee alſo how farre through the benefit of God we be from ſuch hainous and wicked errours. And they alſo, who accuſe vs of ſedition ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue how reuerentlie we thinke of the dignitie of kings, and the Magiſtrates authoritie, and they to

For (that we maie freelie ſaie as it is in deede) that long rancke of names ſealed and written at that booke is ſuch, that it ſeemeth rather to ſtand idlelie in the field, then to fight manfullie.</p>
            <p>And if it had pleaſed vs to followe this pollicie, we might haue ſet downe the names not of ſeuen or eight thouſand meane men (moſt famous Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and ſome other excepted) of whome it maie worthelie be doubted, whether there euer were anie ſuch, or what they were, but alſo the names of farre moe Churches. And this our diligence had beene farre more commendable, namele, beeing beſtowed, not in wringing out and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging from village to village ſome hundreds of names, but in laying out the opinions of moſte gracious Kinges, moſte renoumed Princes, of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble nations, and peoples, of moſte mightie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealthes and Cities: of which a great parte hath not bin vſed to diſpute in corners, or to trifle, but hath knowen theſe manie yeares how euen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to bloode to ſuffer manie and greeuous thinges for Gods trueth ſake.

               </gap>lie to open the meaning of the reformed Churches, to knit all the Churches of Chriſt together with one bond of brotherlie loue, to keepe peace with all men, and ſo farre as it ought to be done, to iudge well of all men: yea and to intreat thoſe, whoe thinke ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what too hardlie of vs, that if we diſagree from the confeſſion of no Church that doth truelie beleeue, they would themſelues alſo beginne to be of the ſame minde with vs, and quietlie, and ſoberlie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre with their bretheren, of what thinges they ſhall thinke good, rather then themſelues to ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der &amp; giue the aduerſaries occcaſion to rayle vpon the Goſpell. But if they will not doe it, let this pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique and euerlaſting monument witnes to all that come after, that we and all of our ſide are &amp; ſhall be free not onelie from the grieuous reproches, with which wee are vndeſeruedlie laden, but alſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blame of all the hurlie burlies and diſſentions that haue beene hitherto and that (which God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid) are peraduenture like tobe more greeuous, vnles it be ſpeedelie preuented on both ſides.</p>
            <p>And ſeeing in this Harmonie we ſpeake not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie with our owne, but euen with the mouth of all thoſe nations, whoſe confeſſions we haue brought into one forme of one and the ſame doctrine; we hope it will come to paſſe that not ſo much the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall names of the French, Belgia, and other Confeſſions ſhal hereafter be heard, as that one on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie vniuerſall, ſimple, plaine, and abſolute Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of all Churches (ſpeaking as it were with one &amp; the ſame tongue of Chanaan) ſhall be ſeene<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that they who were thought to be farre wide (as

hath hitherto not altogether without deſert by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ouer many mens priuate writings beene thought of vs and the brethren of the Confeſſion of Auſpurge) if ſo be that men keepe within the boundes of the Confeſſions, and all cauilling and ſophiſtrie be laide aſide and as well faithfull as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable expoſition be admitted, ſhall be thought very neerelie to agree in al things. And this was the cauſe why we deſired to put the confeſſion of Auſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purge, together alſo with that of Saxony, &amp; Wir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temberge, in this Harmonie, that it might be the more eaſilie known, that both we agree with them in all particular points of faith, and that there are verie few matters hanging in controuerſie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene vs. For concerning that doubt about the Lords Supper, in the, thing and of the thing i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſelfe, there is no ſtrife, we differ in certaine adiuncts and circumſtances of the thing. In the thing it ſelfe, I ſaie, we agree: although as the gifts of God are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, ſo ſome do more plainly, ſome do not ſo plain lie, and perhaps not ſo fitlie, vtter that which they thinke. For we all acknowledge that the holie ſignes, haue not a bare ſignification, but that by the ordinance of God they aſſure our conſciences that the things themſelues are as truelie and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie giuen of God to all that come, as the ſignes themſelues are giuen by Gods miniſter. But this queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> remaineth, whether as the ſigne, ſo alſo the preſent thing it ſelfe be giuen to the body, or rather the preſent ſigne be giuen to the bodie, but the preſent thing giuen onelie to the minde and faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Againe, whether as both be giuen to al, ſo both be receiued of al, of ſome vnto life, and of other ſome
<pb facs="tcp:8251:8"/>
vnto death. In like ſort, we all beleeue the true Communication of the true bodie and the true bloode of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. The controuerſie ſtandeth in the manner of communicating, but who may therefore of right thinke, that the holie vnitie of the Churches is to be plucked a ſunder? That they of our ſide were alwaies deſirous of peace and agreement, the hiſtorie of the conference at Marpurge, and ſuch things as were afterward done in the yeare 1536. doe ſufficientlie witnes.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, ſo often as there appeared any hope of agreement, it is cleare, that there was no other cauſe, but the importunitie of ſome certaine men, why new and ſudden braules beeing raiſed, the matter could not come or long continue in that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement which was hoped for. For that we may let paſſe very many other things, although in the beginning it were openlie knowne among all, that there was no controuerſie betweene vs (no not ſo much as the verie Papiſts excepted) in the opinion about worſhipping the myſterie of the holie Trinitie; loe about the latter end that vnhappie monſter of Vbiquitie came forth, which if it be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, will quite ouerthrow the true doctrine of Chriſts perſon, and his natures. Hence then come the diſtractions of Churches, hence come ſo deadlie quarrellings. But ſeeing this wholl matter hath beene often handled by verie learned men, it is no time for vs to deale any farther therein. For it is ſufficient for vs to ſhew in few wordes, that our men ſo farre as was poſſible, alwaies prouided for the peace of the Church.</p>
            <p>Neither truelie hath any man cauſe after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
<pb facs="tcp:8251:9"/>
of certain moderators (ſuch as not long ſince haue beene) why he ſhould perſwade himſelfe that we would here of this hotch-potch of opinions make a certaine medlie as it were of contrarie qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities. But we leaue all thinges wholl, that euerie one may ſo know his owne words beeing compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the ſayings of others, that he ſhall finde nothing forged, nothing taken away, nothing put to, or wreſted. And to conclude, the forme and drift of this wholl work, if it be more narrowlie vowed, ſhal not vnworthily be iudged a ſound body of chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtian doctrine, framed and alowed by the writings, and as it were by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> common councell of the godlie Churches well nigh of all <hi>Europe.</hi> For here all the chiefe points of our Religion, beeing diſcuſſed and approoued, are by the publique authoritie of all the chiefe nations in Chriſtendome with one conſent publiſhed and knit together: yet we muſt confeſſe, as we afore touched, that through the manifolde and buſie braulings of priuate perſons, and gloſſes (as men commonly ſpeak) the matter was brought farre from the groundes thereof to things cleane beſides the purpoſe and impertinent. For firſt there beganne to be dealing onely about the ſupper: then it came to Chriſts Aſcenſion and ſitting in heauen: and within a while after to the perſonall vnion of both his natures, and what ſtay will there be in the ende? for many, (by all mens leaue be it ſpoken) ſeeme to be delighted with this continual ſtriuing, that howſoeuer, and whatſoeuer it might coſte them, they might not be vnknowne. But it becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the Diſciples of Chriſt to ſeeke peace, and to deſpiſe glorie. For as Bernard ſaith, <hi>They that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:8251:9"/>
               <hi>peace, and ſeeke after glorie, they loſe both peace and glorie.</hi> A way therefore with thoſe ſpeaches, <hi>I am of Paull, I am of Cephas,</hi> &amp; let that one ſaying be heard, I am Chriſts, I am the Churches.</p>
            <p>There is ſomething that may be miſliked, yet there are verie manie things that may wel be liked: the ſame ground work of faith abideth, let therfore the ſame loue continue: and let vs not think much to take them for brethren, whome God vouchſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feth to take for ſonnes: neither let vs deſpiſe thoſe, for whome Chriſt deſpiſed him-ſelfe. That thing is aſſuredlie true, and very much liked of vs, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in holy doctrine is to be thought of ſmal im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance: but rather that euen in the leaſt pointes thereof a certeine faith and full aſſurance is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, flat contrarie to the wauering of the Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mikes: yet we can not like of too too much peeuiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, through which ſome do ſtraight waie vpon ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſmal occaſion cal their brethren heretikes, ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matikes, vngodlie, Mahumetanes: let theſe ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches be throwne out againſt Atheiſts, Epicures, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertines, Arians, Anabaptiſts, and ſuch like miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous perſons, which deſire to haue the Lords field vtterlie deſtroied: but let vs euerie daie grow in faith and loue: and let vs teach the flocks commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to our charge, to feare God, to hate vices, and follow after vertues, to denie the world and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues: obeying the commaundement of our Lord &amp; teacher Ieſus Chriſt, who biddeth vs not tobraule but to loue each other.

It were a farre better thing ſurelie then that which ſome do, buſying the ſharpnes of their wit in making of certeine trifles, that forſooth the knowledge of ſuch ſubtilties, may ſhake out of our mindes all conſcience.

There hath ſcarce beene anie age, which hath in ſuch ſort ſeen al Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches following altogether one thing in all points, ſo as there hath not alwaies been ſome difference, either in doctrine, or in ceremonies or in manners: and yet were not Chriſtian Churches through the world therefore cut a ſunder, vnles peraduenture then, when the Biſhop of Rome brake of all agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp; tyrannically <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It is the faſhion of Romiſts to commaund, to enforce, to preſſe, to through out curſings, and thunder excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions vpon the heades of thoſe that whiſper neuer ſo litle againſt them: but let vs, according to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the holie Ghoſt, ſuffer, and gentlie admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh each other: that is, keeping the groundwork of faith, let vs build loue vpon it, and let vs ioynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie repaire the walls of Sion lying in their ruines.</p>

It remaineth, that through the ſame Lord Chriſt we beſech our reuerent brethren in the lord, whoſe confeſſions publiſhed we ſet forth, that they take this our paines in good parte: and fuffer vs to leane, as it were to a certaine ſtaie, to the common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the reformed Churches, againſt the accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and reproches of the common aduerſaries of the trueth.

Therefore are we alſo commaunded in the common baptiſme of al the faithful to vſe this forme, <hi>Baptize ye all nations in the name of the father, and the ſonne, and the holie Ghoſt.</hi> So alſo in Luke, the Angell Gabriell ſpeaketh to Marie the mother of our Lord. <hi>The holie Ghoſt ſhall come vpon thee, and the power of the higheſt ſhall ouerſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow thee, therefore that holie thing which ſhall be borne of thee, ſhall be called the Sonne of God.</hi> In like manner, <hi>The grace of our Lord Ieſus Christe, and the loue of God, and the fellowſhip of the holie Ghoſt be with you.</hi> Againe, <hi>There are three that beare wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And although this doctrine paſſe al the reach of mans wit, yet we now ſtedfaſtlie beleeue it out of the word of God, looking when we ſhall enioy the full know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thereof in heauen. The offices alſo &amp; effects of theſe three perſons, which euerie of them ſheweth towards vs, are to be marked. For the father by reaſon of his power is called our Creator: the ſonne our Sauiour and redeemer, becauſe he hath redeemed vs by his bloode: the holie Ghoſt is called our Sanctifier, becauſe he dwelleth in our heartes. And the true Church hath allwaies euen from the Apoſtles age vntill theſe times kept this holie doctrine of the bleſſed Trinitie, and manteineth it againſt Iewes, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometanes, and other falſe Chriſtians, and heretikes, ſuch as were Marcion, Manes, Praxeas, Sabellius, Samoſate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, and the like: all which were worthelie condemned by the fathers of moſt ſound Iudgement. Therefore we do here willinglie admit thoſe three Creedes: namelie that of the

               <p>We remember that Luther often ſaid, that <hi>in the olde te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament it is a cleere teſtimonie of the Meſſiah his Godhead, which affirmeth that he is to be inuocated, &amp; by this propertie is the Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as there diſtinguiſhed from other Prophets:</hi> he complained that that moſt weightie teſtimonie was obſcured and weakened by transferring praier to other men.

               <p>The ſecond reaſon is, Inuocation is vaine without faith, &amp; no worſhip is to be brought into the church without gods commaundement: but there is no one ſentence to be ſeene, which ſheweth that this praier made to me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which they man teine, pleaſeth God, and is effectuall: the praier therefore is vaine.

as more mercifull, and others ſought other Mediators. And it is plaine that there is no example to be ſeene in the Prophets or Apoſtles, where prayer is made vnto men, heare me Abraham, or heare me O God for Abrahams ſake: but prayer is made vnto God, who hath reuealed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, to wit, to the eternall father, to the ſonne our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, and to the holie Ghoſt, that he would receiue, heare and ſaue vs for the ſonnes ſake.

In theſe forme; we know what we praie vnto. And ſeing there are teſtimonies of Gods word to be ſeene, which ſhewe that this praying pleaſeth God, and is heard, ſuch praying maie be made in faith. Theſe thinges are not to be found in that inuocation which is made vnto men. Some gather teſtimonies out of Auguſtine and others, to ſhewe that the Saintes in heauen haue care of humane affaires.

                  <p>AS touching Images, our preachers reprooued this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeciallie out of the holie ſcriptures, that adoring and inuocating of them is ſo openlie graunted to the ſimple peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple againſt the expreſſe commaundement of God.

                  <p>The heathens alſo vſed a pretence of inſtruction &amp; teaching, to mainteine their Idolls, but the holie fathers reſted not in ſuch excuſes (Of which matter Lactantius treateth at large in his ſecond booke of Inſtitut.) nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could the heathens better abide to be vpbraided for that they worſhipped ſtones, and ſtockes, then can the men of our age, as they which oftentimes confidentlie affirmed, that they tooke the Images to be nothing els but Images: and that they ſought nothing els, but to be inſtructed and admoniſhed by them.</p>
                  <p>And theſe thinges doth Athanaſius controll in theſe words: <hi>Go to, let them tell me how God is knowne by Images, that is whether it be for the matter whereof they conſiſt, or for the forme im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in that matter.

For God himſelfe ſhineth forth euen in the matter, before that anie thing be framed thereof by mans handes for all things ſhew forth gods glorie. But if the forme is ſelfe, which is fitted to the matter, giueth occaſion to knowe God, what neede ſuch Images? might not God be knowne farre more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentlie by the things themſelues, whereof Images be made? ſurelie the glorie of God might much more viſiblie be ſeene, by the liuing creatures themſelues, either reaſonable, or vnreaſonable, ſet before our eies, then by dead Images which can not m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Other queſtions, as, whether god would haue Adam fall, or whether he forced him to fall, or why he did not hinder his fall, and ſuch like, we account amongſt curious queſtions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (vnleſſe perchance the frowardnes of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes, or of men otherwiſe importunate, doe compell vs to open theſe points alſo out of the word of God, as the godly Doctours of the Church haue often times done) knowing that the Lord did forbid that man ſhould not eate of the forbidden fruite, and puniſhed his transgreſſion: and alſo that the things done are not euill in reſpect of the proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, will, and power of God, but in reſpect of Sathan, and our will reſiſting the will of God.</p>

there is a triple condition or eſtate of man to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Firſt what man was before his fall, to wit, vpright and free, who might both continue in goodnes, and decline to euil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but he declined to euil, &amp; hath wrapped both himſelfe &amp; al mankind in ſinne and death, as hath bin ſhewed before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Secondlie, we are to conſider, what man was after his fall. His vnderſtanding indeed was not taken from him, neither was he depriued of will, and altogether chaunged into a ſtone or ſtocke. Neuettheles theſe thinges are ſo altered in man, that they are not able to doe that now, which they could doe before his fall. For his vnderſtanding is darkned, and his will which before was free, is now become a ſeruile wil for it ſerueth ſinne, not nilling, but willing: for it is called a wil, and not a nilling. Therfore as touching euil or ſin, man doth euil, not compelled either by god or the deuil, but of his owne accord: and in this reſpect he hath a moſte free wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> but whereas we ſee, that often times the moſte euill deedes and counſells of man are hindered by god, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not attaine to their end, this doth not take from man li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie in euill, but God by his power doth preuent that, which man otherwiſe purpoſed freelie: as, Ioſephes bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren did freelie purpoſe to ſleie Ioſephe: but they were not able to doe it, becauſe it ſeemed otherwiſe good to God in his ſecret counſell. But as touching goodnes and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, mans vnderſtanding doth not of it ſelfe iudge aright of heauenlie thinges. For the Euangelicall and Apoſtolike ſcripture requireth regeneration of euerie one of vs that w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

there is ſome vnderſtanding of earthlie thinges remaining in man after his fall.

                  <p>Laſtlie we are to conſider, whether the regenerate haue free will, and how farre forth they haue it.

For they are mooued of God, that themſelues maie doe that which they doe. And Auguſtine doth trulie alledge that ſaying, that <hi>God is ſaid to be our helper: For no man can be helped, but he, that doth ſomewhat.</hi> The Manichees did bereeue man of all action, and made him like a ſtone and a blocke.</p>
                  <p>Secondlie, that in the regenerate there remaineth infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie. For ſeeing that ſinne dwelleth in vs, and that fleſh in the regenerate ſtriueth againſt the ſpirit, euen to our liues end, they do not red<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

That <hi>Originall iuſtice</hi> doth compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend all theſe things, it maie be vnderſtood by this ſaying, <hi>Man was created after the Image and likenes of God,</hi> which Paul doth thus interpret, Epheſ. 4. <hi>Put ye on the new man, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter God is created in righteouſnes and true holines,</hi> where vndou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedlie by true holines he vnderſtandeth all thoſe ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, which ſhine in our nature, and are giuen by God, not aſcited by arte, or gotten by inſtruction (as now thoſe ſhadowes of vertues, ſuch as they are in men, be aſcited) becauſe that then God dwelling in man did go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne him. And when we conſider what <hi>Originall</hi>

ſignify, then the priuation oppoſite therunto is leſſe obſcure. Therefore <hi>Originall ſinne</hi> is, both for the fall of our firſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and for the corruption which followed that fall, euen in our birth to be ſubiect to the wrath of God, and to be worthie of eternall damnation, except we obteine remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the Mediatours ſake. And this corruption is, to want now the light or the preſence of God, which ſhould haue ſhined in vs: and it is an eſtranging of our will from God, and the ſtubbernnes of the heart reſiſting the lawe of the minde, as Paull ſpeaketh; and, that man is not the Temple of God, but a miſerable Maſſe, without God, and without iuſtice. Theſe wants, and this wholl corruption, we ſaie to be ſinne, not onelie a puniſhment of ſinne, and a thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, as manie of the Sententiaries doe ſaie, <hi>That theſe euills are onelie a puniſhment, and a thing indifferent, but not ſinne.</hi> And they doe extenuate this Originall euill, and then they feigne that men maie ſatisfie the lawe of God, and by their owne fulfilling of the law become iuſt. The Church muſt auoide ambiguities. Therefore we doe expreſſelie name theſe euills, <hi>Corruption,</hi> which is often named of the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent writers, <hi>Euill concupiſcence.</hi> But we diſtinguiſh thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires which were created in our nature, from that confuſion of order which hapned after our fall, as it is ſaide, Iere. 17. <hi>The heart of man is wicked.</hi> And Paull ſaith, <hi>The wiſdome of the fleſh is enmitie againſt God.</hi> This euill Concupiſcence we ſay to be ſinne, and we affirme, that this wholl doctrine of ſinne, as it is propounded and taught in our Churches, is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall conſent of the true Church of God.</p>

                  <p>And although after this manner our fathers had the goſpell in the writinges of the Prophets, by which they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ſaluation in Chriſt through faith, yet the goſpell is properlie called that glad and happie tidings, wherein firſt by Iohn Baptiſt, then by Chriſt the Lorde himſelfe, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward by the Apoſtles &amp; their ſucceſſours, is preached to

vs in the world, that God hath now performed that, which he promiſed from the beginning of the world, &amp; hath ſent, yea and giuen vnto vs, his onelie ſonne, and in him reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation with the father, remiſſion of ſinnes, all fulnes, and euerlaſting life. The hiſtorie therefore ſet downe by the foure Euageliſts, declaring how theſe thinges were done or fulfilled of Chriſt, and what he taught and did, and that they which beleeued in him had al fulnes, this, I ſaie, is truelie called the Goſpell. The preaching alſo and ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Apoſtles, in which they expound vnto vs how the ſonne was giuen vs of the father, and in him all things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to life and ſaluation, is truelie called the doctrine of the Goſpell, ſo as euen at this daie it looſeth not that worthie name, if it be ſincere.</p>
                  <p>The ſame preaching of the Goſpel is by the Apoſtle tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <note place="margin">2. Cor. 3.</note>

For which cauſe it is called by the Apoſtle, <hi>the miniſtery of death:</hi> for hitherto pertaineth that ſaying of the A<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>The letter killeth, but the ſpirit giueth life.</hi> The falſe Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles preached the Goſpel, corrupted by mingling of the law therewith, as though Chriſt could not ſaue without the law. Such alſo were the Hebionites ſaid to be, which came of Hebion the heretike: and the Nazarites, which before time were called Myneans. Al which we doe condemne, ſincerely preaching the worde, and teaching, that the beleeuers are iuſtified by the ſpirit onelie, and not by the law. But of this matter there ſhall follow a more large diſcourſe in the title of iuſtification.</p>
                  <p>And although the doctrine of the Goſpel compared with the Phariſees doctrine of the law might ſeeme (when it was firſt preached by Chriſt) to be a new doctrine, the which thing alſo Ieremie propheſied of the new Teſtament, yet in deed it not onelie was, &amp; as yet is (though the Papiſts call it new, in regarde of Popiſh doctrine, which hath of long time

For except a man take the name of the law generallie for doctrine, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets now and then do vſe the name of the law, certainlie the Goſpell of Chriſt, is not properlie a law, as Paull doth commonlie vſe the name of the law, but it is a good and ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full meſſage, touching the ſonne of God, our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, that he onelie is the purger of our ſinnes, the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſer of the wrath of God, and our redeemer and ſauiour.</p>
                  <p>Neither are the commaundements of the law, which are conteined in the Apoſtles writings, any new law, but they are an interpretation of the olde law, according to the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the holie Ghoſt, which alſo were to be ſeene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and that not obſcurelie, in the writinges of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.

Wherefore if we will ſpeake properlie of the law of God, and Goſpell of Chriſt, as of Chriſt we are not to make a new lawgiuer, ſeeing that he neither hath made a new law, nor inſtituted a new politi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

doe obteine eternal ſaluation, for the merit of the workes of the law, but onelie for the merit of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, through faith. Chriſt out of Iſaiah doth recite his office, for the which he was ſent into the earth: <hi>The ſpirit of the Lorde,</hi>

This repentance and ſauing conuerſion doth our mercifull God, by his peculiar gifte, offer, and beſtowe, and he writeth the ſame in the hearts of the faithfull, euen as he ſaith, <hi>I will giue you a new heart, and I will put my ſpirit in the midſt of you, and</hi>

                  <p>This ſauing repentance (which doth differ verie much from the repentance of Eſau and ludas) taketh it true and right beginning from this gifte of God, who beſtoweth it, and from the ſermons of the word of God, whereby ſinne is reprooued: and it hath this in order firſt, that it is a feare and terrour of the ſecret heart before God, and that by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting and ſorowing it doth tremble at this iuſt and ſeuere iudgement and reuengement, whereupon ariſeth a heauie, trembling, and vnquiet conſcience, a troubled minde, a heart ſo ſorrowfull, carefull, and bruiſed, that a man can haue no comfort with himſelfe and of himſelfe, but his ſoull is full of all griefe, ſadnes, anguiſh, and terrour, wherby he is much troubled, becauſe of the feare of that burning wrath, which he ſeeth in the ſeuere countenance of God.

                  <p>THe Diuines and Canoniſts haue caſt a great myſt of darkenes chieflie vpon this point of Chriſtian do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine touching repentance: as not onelie their bookes doe teſtifie, but alſo the conſciences of al the godlie, which doe confeſſe that the intricate and endles diſputations of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines, and the infinite traditions about the matter of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, was euen a fearefull racking of their conſciences. For they doe no where teach any certaintie, how remiſſion of ſins is obteined. And as for faith, there is no word amongſt them. Yea they bid men to be alwaies in doubt of remiſſion of ſinnes. Afterward they torment mens conſciences, with a harſh reckoning vp of their faults, and with ſatisfactions. For what a ſnare vnto a mans conſcience was the tradition, which requireth them to reckon vp all their ſinnes.</p>
                  <p>As for ſatisfactions, they did obſcure and darken the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:8251:103"/>
of Chriſt, becauſe that euen the learned among them did imagine that eternall death was recompenſed by them. But the vnlearned were perſwaded that forgiuenes of the fault was purchaſed by ſuch deedes. What that their ſeruices for the moſt part were not commaunded of God? as babling of praiers, inuocation of Saints, Pilgrimages, and ſuch like ſtuffe. Thus was the pure doctrine of repentance ouerwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with an huge heape of vnprofitable and euill opinions. And it is manifeſt that the godly in manie ages paſt haue greatlie wiſhed that this doctrine had beene more purelie taught.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, it is eſpeciallie needefull that the doctrine of repentance ſhould be taught in the Church moſt purelie and ſincerely. Therfore our Diuines haue laboured to cleare this point as much as might be. And ſurelie they haue ſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened and cleared it, that the ſoundeſt euen amongſt our aduerſaries do confeſſe, that in this matter they haue welde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued of the Church for we do ſimply and plainlie without anie Sophiſtrie laie ſorth that, which the Goſpell teacheth touchingrepentance, that men may perceiue how they muſt returne vnto Chriſt, by what meanes remiſſion of ſinnes is obteined, what worſhip &amp; what workes doe pleaſe God: Firſt we teach that contrition is requiſite, thatis, the true terrors and ſorrows of the minde, which feeleth the wrath of God, is grieued for ſinne committed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ceaſeth to do euill. And though theſe ſorrows be requiſite, yet muſt we know that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſinnes is not graunted for the worthines of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, or of theſe ſorrowes, but we muſt ioyne faith with them, that is, a truſt and confidence of mercie promiſed for Chriſtes ſake, and we holde, that our ſinnes are freelie for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen for Chriſtes ſake.</p>
                  <p>When we once are comforted in theſe terrours by faith, we do vndoubtedlie obteine remiſſion of ſinnes, as we haue ſaid before. And this faith our mindes do conceiue by the Goſpell; alſo by the abſolution, which preacheth and appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Goſpell vnto the diſtreſſed conſciences. And for this cauſe do our diuines teach, <note n="*" place="margin">Look the 5. obſeru.</note>that priuate Abſolution is to be reteined in the Church, and they ſet out the dignitie of it, and the power of the keies, with true and verie large commendations: namelie becauſe the power of the keies
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:8251:103"/>
doth diſpenſe the Goſpell not onelie to al in general, but alſo to euerie * one in particular: as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Thou haſt wonne thy brother, &amp;c.</hi> and becauſe we muſt beleeue the voice of the Goſpell, which is diſpenſed vnto vs in abſolution by the miniſtery of the Church, no otherwiſe then a voice ſounding from heauen.</p>
                  <p>This wholl benefit of abſolution and of this miniſterie hath heretofore beene whollie obſcured with the falſe opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſuch, as taught, that abſolution was naught worth, without ſufficient contrition, and did afterwards wil men to miſdoubt of abſolution, becauſe no man knewe whether his contrition were ſufficient or not. What els was this but quite to take awaie from all conſciences the comfort of the Goſpell, and to remooue out of the Church and cleane to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſh the miniſtery of the Goſpel or the power of the keies? whodoth not ſee that theſe pernitious errors are worthely reprooued?</p>
                  <p>Now ſeeing that confeſſion yealdeth a place where to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowe abſolution in priuate, and this cuſtome doth vpholde the vnderſtanding of the power of the keies, and remiſſion of ſinnes, among the people; beſides ſeeing that this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference auaileth much for admoniſhing and inſtructing of men, therefore we doe duelie retaine Confeſſion in our Churches, yet ſo, as that wee teach that reckoning vp of the faultes is not neceſſarie by Gods lawe, and that mens conſciences are not to be clogged with it. For there is no commaundement in all the Apoſtles writinges ſounding that way. Againe, this rehearſing of all ones ſinnes is a thing impoſſible, according to that in the Pſalme, <hi>Who can vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand his faultes.</hi> And Ieremie ſaieth, <hi>The heart of man is corrupt and vnſearchable.</hi> But if no ſinnes could be forgiuen, but ſuch as are reckoned vp, mens conſciences could neuer be at reſt, becauſe they neither ſee, nor can call to minde the greateſt number of them. Whereby it maie eaſilie be gathered, that the miniſterie of abſolution and remiſſion of ſinnes doth not depend vpon the condition of numbring them vp all.</p>
                  <p>The auncient writers alſo doe teſtifie that this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of ſinnes by tale is a thing needles. Chryſoſtome on the Epiſtle to the Heb. ſaith, <hi>Let vs recken of it, that we haue ſins, and let not the tongue alone vtter it, but the conſcience within vs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo.</hi>

                     <hi>And let vs not barelie ſaie we are ſinners, but let vs recken vp our ſinnes particularlie, I doe not bid the to bewraie thy ſelfe openlie, nor to occuſe thy ſelfe to other, but to followe the ſaying of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, Laie open thy waies before the Lord, confeſſe thy ſinnes before God, vtter thy ſinnes with praier before the true iudge, not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring them with the tongue, but with the conſcience, &amp; then in deed maiſt thou hope to finde mercie.</hi> That ſermon of Chryſoſtomes, teacheth not onelie what is to be thought of reckoning vp of ſinnes, but doth alſo verie wiſelie ioyne contrition and faith together, as they are ioyned by vs. Firſt he will haue vs acknowledge our ſinnes vnfainedly, and abhorre them from our heartes: In the next place he teacheth to adde there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto praier &amp; faith, which maie aſſure vs that we are forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. Elſewhere he ſaith, <hi>Acknowledge thy ſins that thou maiſt as them away.

Wherefore our iudgement touching the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of confeſſion is neither new nor without reaſon.</p>
                  <p>Laſtlie there is moſte need of all that the godlie ſhoulde be admoniſhed, touching ſatisfactions. For there was more hurte and daunger in them, then in numbring vp of ſinnes, in as much as they darkened the benefit of Chriſt: becauſe that the vnlearned thought they did obtaine remiſſion of the guilt of ſin for their owne workes ſake: and beſides mens conſciences were much diſtreſſed if aught were omitted that was inioyned for ſatisfaction. Againe, ceremonies and pilgrimages, and ſuch like fruitles workes, were thought meete for ſatisfaction, rather then thinges commaunded of God. And forſooth their teachers themſelues dreamed that eternall death was fullie redeemed by them. Therfore we thought it needfull that godlie mindes ſhould be ſet free from ſuch errors, and we teach that their canonicall ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, which they call workes not due &amp;c, are neither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaileable for the remiſſion either of the fault or euerlaſting puniſhment, nor yet neceſſarie. It was a cuſtome long ſince
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:8251:104"/>
in the Church, that in publike penance ſuch as had fallen &amp; did returne to the Church againe, ſhould not be receiued without ſome puniſhment laid vpon them for examples ſake: from which cuſtome theſe ſatisfactions did ſpring But the fathers minde was by ſuch examples to fraie the people from ſinnes: they did not account that Ceremonie to be a iuſt recompence for the fault, or for eternall death, or for purgatorie paines. Theſe things were afterwards coyned by ignorant and vnlearned men. But thoſe auncient cuſtomes <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 6. Obſeruat.</note>were in time worne out of vſe, and laid aſide. As for vs, we doe not burden mens conſciences with ſatisfactions: but this weteach, that the fruites of repentance are neceſſarie, and that obedience, the feare of God, faith, loue, chaſtitie, &amp; the wholl renuing of the ſpirit ought to increaſe in vs.</p>
                  <p>We giue men warning <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 7. ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruat.</note>of this alſo, that ſinnes are eft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonnes puniſhed euen by temporal puniſhments in this life, as Dauid, Manaſſes, &amp; manie others were puniſhed, and we teach that theſe puniſhments maie be mitigated by good works, &amp; the whol practize of repentance, as Paul declareth, <hi>If we would iudge our ſelues we ſhould not be iudged of the lord.</hi> And repentance deſerued (that is, obteined) that God ſhould alter his purpoſe, touching the deſtruction of Niniuie.</p>
                  <p>Thus whereas before the diſputations were intricate and endles, and full of groſſe opinions, now that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine beeing purged is deliuered to the people ſo, as it maie be vnderſtoode, and auaile much vnto godlines. We doe ſtill holde and ſet forth the true partes of repentance, Contrition, Faith, Abſolution, Remiſſion of ſinnes, Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the wholl life, Mitigation of preſent puniſhmentes: and wee are in good hope, that the godlie will not onelie not reprehend anie thing in this place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but alſo will giue them thankes which haue purged this pointe of Chriſtian doctrine, which is requiſite and profitable in all Churches to be expounded moſte plainlie and ſet out moſte clearelie.

                  <p>And this we doe much more reprehend, that in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Repentance or conuerſion, our aduerſaries doe no where make mention of iuſtifying faith, (whereof we haue ſpoken before) by which alone Remiſſion of ſinnes is truelie receiued, the heart is lifted vp euen when it hath a feeling of the wrath of God, and we are freed from the ſorowes of hell, as it is written.

Yet do we not make contention either about the manner of ſpeaking, or about the number of the partes, but we wiſh that all men may ſee thoſe thinges which are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie. And it is moſte neceſſarie for the Church, that there ſhould be a true, plaine, and moſt cleare doctrine, touching the wholl conuerſion, which alſo is verie often repeated in thoſe ſermons, which are ſet downe in the ſcriptures, and that with great perſpicuitie, &amp; without anie intricate laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthes, as the Baptiſt and Chriſt ſaie, Math. 3. <hi>Repent, and beleeue the Goſpell,</hi> Againe, <hi>Repent: Beholde the lambe of God, that taketh awaie the ſinnes of the world.</hi> And Paule ſaieth. <hi>Ro.</hi> 3. <hi>All men are depriued of the glorie of god.</hi> Here he ſpeaketh o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Neither is it ſufficient that our aduerſaries ſaie, that they alſo doe ſpeake of faith, and that faith doth goe before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. For they ſpeake of the doctrine of knowledge, I beleeue the forgiuenes of ſinnes, to wit, that they be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen to others, euen as the deuills doe know the Creede: but the Goſpell doth require this true faith, which is an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of the mercie of God, promiſed for the ſonne of god his ſake, and reſting in the Sonne of God, which ſaith, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that remiſſion of ſinnes is giuen vnto me alſo, and that freelie, not for anie Contrition, not for anie my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, but for the Sonne of God, who by the infinite goodnes and wiſedome of the godhead is appointed a Mediatour &amp; redeemer. I know that the commaundement of God is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable, ſo that euerie one maie determine in theſe griefes, that he is aſſured lie receiued into fauour for Chriſt his ſake. This is the proper voice of the goſpel: this decree is brought
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:8251:106" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by the Sonne out of the boſome of the eternall father, and is ſealed vp by his blood and reſurrection. Not to aſſent to this wil and decree, is to contemne the Sonne of God: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this ſinne, Iohn ſaith, cap. 3. <hi>He that beleeueth not the Some, the wrath of God abideth on him.</hi> But he that beleeueth that his ſinnes be forgiuen for this Mediatours ſake, he doth now certainelie receiue remiſſion of his ſinnes for Chriſt his ſake, which is effectuall in him, and quickneth and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifieth him by his holy Spirit: and being now reconciled, he is vndoubtedly accounted iuſt, for the Mediatours ſake, &amp; is heir of eternal life. Either to omit, or to corrupt, or to diſlike this neceſſarie comfort, touching conuerſion, is as much as manifeſtlie to extinguiſh the Goſpel. As touching this faith, abſolution ought both to admoniſh vs, and alſo to confirme it, as Dauid was confirmed, when he heard this abſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, 2. Reg. 12. <hi>The Lorde hath taken awaie thy ſinne.</hi> So know thou that the voice of the Goſpell doth declare remiſſion vnto thee alſo, the which remiſſion is namelie propounded to thee in abſolution. Doe not thou feigne, that the Goſpell doth nothing at all pertaine to thee, but knowe that it was therfore publiſhed, that by this meanes men imbracing the Goſpell might be ſaued<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that it is the eternall and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable commaundement of God, that thou ſhouldeſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue it.

It was a cuſtome among our firſt fathers,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:8251:107"/>
that they which defiled themſelues with murther, Idolls, or filthie luſtes, ſhould be barred their companie, and chieflie from their ſacrifices. This cuſtome both the Sinagogue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined, and other nations alſo, which were not altogether ſauage, in Aſia and in Greece. In the meane time they which were defiled, wandred vp &amp; downe, beeing branded with the marks of their guiltines, as Oreſtes, A draſtus, &amp; many others. This cuſtome in the beginning did the Church alſo keepe. Thoſe that were defiled, it ſeuered from the mutuall ſociety, afterward it did not ſodenlie receiue thoſe againe that did repent, that it might be knowne that they did vnfeignedlie aske pardon, and for examples ſake it might profite others, but for certaine daies abſolution was deferred, that they might be ſeene to aske pardon publikelie. So was that ince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuous Corinthian debarred, &amp; afterward receiued againe, not without deliberation, 1. Cor. 5. This wholl cuſtome was appointed <note n="*" place="margin">looke the 4. obſeruat.</note>for examples ſake, and is politicall, nothing at all pertaining to the Remiſſion of ſinnes. But afterward tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough ſuperſtition it ſo encreaſed, that faſtes and forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the companie of man or wife, were inioyned for manie yeares. When theſe burthens had increaſed too much, the Biſhoppes did releaſe them againe, and this releaſe of ſuch rites was called <hi>Indulgence.</hi>

the power of the keies hath no commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to inioyne ſuch puniſhments. Alſo we feare that this applying of indulgences, by which the Pope doth applie the merites of Saintes vnto others, is but counterfeit, and that the indulgences in times paſte were nothing elſe, but a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſing of the Canons, which did nothing appertaine to thoſe ſatisfactions, whereof the monkes doe ſpeake. Now it is another thing to ſpeake of ſatisfaction which is due, as of the reſtoring of theft, of that which hath bin gotten by vſury, of another mans wife, or his good name.</p>
                  <p>This reſtitution is a worke that is due, pertaining to new obedience, as Paull ſaith, Eph. 4 <hi>Let him that hath ſtolne ſteale no more.</hi> He that withholdeth another mans wife, hath nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther contrition, faith, nor new obedience. Neither are the commaundements of god, touching due ſatisfaction, which we ſaie ought to be made, to be mingled with thoſe trifling ſonges of popiſh ſatisfactions. Alſo this we confeſſe, that in this life manie horrible puniſhments are ſpread ouer the Church, ouer Empires, &amp; ouer families, for certaine ſins of manie men, yea euen of the Elect: as the ſedition that was raiſed vp againſt Dauid, did not lightlie afflict that whol ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil regiment, &amp; many holy families.

                  <p>And albeit that euen temporall puniſhments <note n="*" place="margin">looke the 6. obſeruat. vpon this confeſſ.</note>are chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie mitigated for the Sonne of God his ſake, who is the hearbour for the Church, becauſe this weake nature can not ſuſteine the greatnes of the wrath of God, as Daniel praieth, Chap. 9. <hi>For the Lordes ſake heare thou vs, and haue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Cor. 11. <hi>If we would iudge our ſelues, we ſhould not be iudged,</hi> he ſpeaketh of wholl repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, not of thoſe moſte vaine ſhadowes, which they rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to preuaile, although a man fall againe into mortall

ſinne. And in this matter they haue deuiſed new iugling trickes. They confeſſe that theſe ſatisfactions are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compences, but they ſaie, that we muſte admitte ſuch ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions as chaſtiſements, as Paull doth puniſh the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthian. 1.

doth deſerue remiſſion of ſinnes, or that it is a purging of our ſinnes before God, we thinke it contrarie to the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like doctrine.

But ſeeing that God doth promiſe vnto vs his free mercie for Chriſt his Sonnes ſake, and doth require of vs, that we doe obedientlie beleeue the Goſpell of his ſonne, he therewith alſo doth require, that we mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the doubting of the fleſh, and haue a moſte aſſured affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in his mercie, that we doe not accuſe his promiſe to be ſo full of deceit, as we are of doubting. And that we maie conceiue ſure confidence therein, he placed our ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not in the merites of our righteouſnes, which is vnper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, but onelie in the merites of his ſonne our Lord Ieſus Chriſt: whoſe righteouſnes, as it is moſte perfect, ſo is it moſte firme and conſtant in the iudgement of God.

                  <p>AS touching ſatisfaction, we beleeue and confeſſe, that the alone paſſion and death of the onelie begotten ſonne of God our Lord Ieſus Chriſt is a ſatisfaction for our ſinnes, and that this ſatisfaction of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Chriſt is offered and applied to vs by the miniſterie of the Goſpell, and is recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of vs by faith.

Wherefore neither Chriſt himſelfe, nor the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles would commaund it. Therfore for this cauſe our prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers doe exhort men to confeſſe their ſinnes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall they ſhew what fruit ariſeth hereof, that a man ſhould ſecretlie ſeeke for comforte, counſell, doctrine, inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and at the hands of a man, that is a Chriſtian, and wiſe, yet by commaundement they vrge no man, but doe rather affirme, that ſuch commaundements doe hinder godlines. For that conſtitution of confeſſing ſinnes vnto a
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:8251:110"/>
prieſt, hath driuen infinite ſoules vnto deſperation, and is ſubiect to ſo manie corruptions, that of late it ought to haue bene abrogated, and without doubt had bene abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, if the gouernours of Churches of late time had burned with ſo great a zeale to remooue awaie ſtumbling blookes, as in times paſt Neſtorius the Biſhoppe of Conſtantinople did burne, who did vtterlie aboliſh ſecret confeſſion in his Church, becauſe that a certaine noble woman, going often to Church, vnder pretence of doing the workes of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, was deprehended to haue to doe with a Deacon. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite ſuch vndoubted ſinnes were committed euerie where. Moreouer the Pontifical laws do require that the hearer &amp; iudge of confeſſion ſhould be ſo holie, learned, wiſe, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull, that a man can hardlie finde out, eſpeciallie among thoſe that are commonlie appointed to heare confeſſions, to whom he might confeſſe him ſelfe. And now the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men doe thinke, that it is better to confeſſe ſinnes to a laie man, then to that Prieſt, by whome we maie not looke to be edified in godlines. This is the ſumme: That confeſſion bringeth more hurt then profit, which ſound repentance &amp; true ſorow of the minde for ſinnes committed doth not wring out. Therfore ſeeing this is the gift of god alone, that we maie repent of our ſinnes, &amp; be truelie ſorowfull for that we haue ſinned, nothing, that maie turne to ſaluation, can be done in this matter by commaundementes, as hath hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto bene too too manifeſt euen by experience.</p>

Yea, to ſaie ſomewhat more, if they be not of faith, but contrary to faith, they are of no value at all, but are an abomination and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thines before the face of God.

For this promiſe alſo doth pertaine to the hiſtory of Chriſt, euen as in the Creede vnto the hiſtorie is added this article, <hi>I beleeue the remiſſion of ſins.</hi> And vnto this one the other articles, touching the hiſtory of Chriſt, are to be referred.

All theſe doe certainlie obtaine remiſſion of ſinnes. And when as we doe in this ſort comfort our ſelues by the promiſe of the goſpell, and doe raiſe vp our ſelues by faith, therewithall is the holie ſpirit giuen vnto vs. For the holie ſpirit is giuen, and is effectual, by the worde of god and by the Sacraments.

And whereas in moſte Churches there hath bin of a long time no word of the moſte ſpeciall works, namely, of the exerciſes of faith, and of the praiſe of ſuch workes as pertaine to Ciuill gouernment, but for the moſte parte they ſpent all their ſermons in ſetting forth praiſes of humane traditions, and in commending holie daies, faſtings, the ſtate of Monkes, Fraternities, Pilgrimages, the worſhip of Saints, Roſiers, &amp; other vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſeruices, now by the goodnes of God the Church is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed vnto the true &amp; profitable worſhip, which god doth require and approoue.

From this error they reuoke the Church vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the true ſeruice of God, &amp; vnto good works in deed. What can be more forceablie ſpoken, then that ſermon in the 49. <hi>Pſal.

that remiſſion of ſinnes and iuſtification is giuen vs for Chriſts ſake. This knowledge and iudgement bringeth ſure conſolation vnto troubled mindes, and how neceſſarie it is for the Church, conſciences that haue had experience can eaſilie iudge.

For remiſſion of ſinnes is remooued from our workes, and attributed vnto mercie, that it might be an vndoubted benefit, not that we ſhoulde be idle, but much more, that wee ſhoulde knowe how greathe our obedience doth pleaſe god euen in this our ſo great infirmitie. Now for any man to diſpiſe or miſlike this doctrine, whereby both the honour of Chriſt is extolled, and moſt ſweete &amp; ſure comfort offered vnto godlie mindes, and which conteineth the true knowledge of gods mercie, and bringeth forth the true worſhip of God and eternall life, it is more then Phariſaicall blindnes.</p>
                  <p>Before time when as this doctrine was not ſet forth, many fearefull conſciences aſſaied to eaſe themſelues by workes, ſome fled to a monaſticall life, others did chuſe out other workes, thereby to merit remiſſion of ſinnes and iuſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But there is no ſure comforte without this doctrine of the goſpell, which willeth men to beleeue, that remiſſion of ſinnes and iuſtification are freelie giuen vnto vs for Chriſts ſake, and this wholl doctrine is appointed for the true conflict of a terrified conſcience. But we will adde ſome te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies. Paull Rom. 3. <hi>We are iustified freelie, by his grace, through redemption that is in Chriſt Ieſus, whome god hath ſet forth, to be a reconciliation thorough faith in his bloode.</hi> Rom. 4. <hi>But to him that worketh not, but beleeueth in him that iuſtifieth the vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, his faith is counted for righteouſnes.</hi> Epheſ. 2. <hi>By grace ye are ſaued, through faith, and not of your ſelues.</hi> In theſe and ſuch like ſentences Paull doth plainlie teach, that remiſſion of ſinnes and iuſtification are giuen vs freelie, and not for the worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of our workes. And in the 4 to the Rom. he diſputeth at large, why this conſolation is needefull for vs, for if the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe did depend vpon the worthines of our works, it ſhould be vncertaine. Wherefore to the end that we may haue ſure
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:8251:125"/>

                  <p>When therefore we doe ſaie, that <hi>we are iuſtified by faith,</hi> we do not meane, that we are iuſt for the worthines of that vertue, but this is our meaning, that we doe obteine remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſins, and imputation of righteouſnes by mercie ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vs for Chriſts ſake. But now this mercie can not be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, but by faith. And <hi>Faith</hi> doth not here ſignifie onelie a knowledge of the hiſtorie, but it ſignifieth a beleefe of the promiſe of mercie which is graunted vs through our Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour Chriſt Ieſus. And ſeeing that faith is in this ſorte vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode of a confidence or truſt of mercie, Saint Paull, and Saint Iames, doe not diſagree. For where as Iames ſaith, <hi>The Deuills beleeue, and tremble,</hi> he ſpeaketh of an hiſtoricall faith, now this faith doth not iuſtifie. For the wicked and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill are conning in the hiſtorie. But Paull when he ſaith: <hi>Faith is reckoned for righteouſnes,</hi> he ſpeaketh of a truſt and confidence of mercie, promiſed for Chriſts ſake: and his meaning is, that men are pronounced righteouſe, that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled through mercie promiſed for Chriſts ſake, whome we muſt receiue by faith. Now this noueltie of this figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue ſpeach of Saint Paull, <hi>We are iuſtified by faith,</hi> will not offend holie mindes, if they vnderſtand that it is ſpoken properlie of mercie, and that herein mercie is adorned with true and due praiſes. For what can be more acceptable to an afflicted and fearefull conſcience in great greefes, then to heare that this is the commaundement of God, &amp; the voice of the bridgrome Chriſt Ieſus, that they ſhould vndoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie beleeue, that remiſſion of ſinnes or reconciliation is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto them, not for their owne worthines, but freelie, through mercie, for Chriſts ſake, that the benefite might be certaine? Now <hi>Iuſtification</hi> in theſe ſayings of Saint Paull doth ſignifie remiſſion of ſins, or reconciliation, or imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

                  <p>WHen as we do teach in our Churches the moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary doctrine, and comforte of faith, we ioyne therewith the doctrine of good workes, to wit, that obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence vnto the law of God is requiſite in them that be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled. For the Goſpell preacheth newnes of life, according to that ſaying. <hi>I will put my lawes in their heartes:</hi> This new life therefore muſt be an obedience towardes God. The Goſpell alſo preacheth repentance, and faith cannot be, but onlie in them, that doe repent, becauſe that faith doth comfort the heartes in contrition &amp; in the feares of ſin, as Paul ſaith, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing iuſtified by faith, we haue peace.</hi> And of repentance he ſaith, Rom. 6. <hi>Our olde man is crucified, that the bodie of ſinne might be aboliſhed, that we might no more ſerue ſinne.</hi> And Eſaie ſaith, <hi>Where will the Lorde dwell?

<pb n="272" facs="tcp:8251:126"/>
the chiefeſt worſhip of God, is faith, which doth bring forth manie other vertues, which could neuer be in men, except their hearts had firſt receiued to beleue. <hi>How ſhall they call <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And in deede none can euer ſpeake wel of theſe exerciſes, if the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences be left in doubt, and if they know not that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth faith as a ſpeciall worſhip of his. And when as that huge ſhew of outward works is caſt (as a myſt) before mens eies, the mindes, eſpeciallie ſuch as be not well inſtructed, are led aware from beholding theſe inward exerciſes. Now it is verie requiſite, that men ſhould be taught and inſtructed, concerning theſe inwarde workes and fruites of the ſpirit. For theſe they be that make a difference betweene the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and hypocrites. As for externall worſhip, externall cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and other outwarde workes, the verie hypocrites can performe them. But theſe ſeruices and duties belong onelie to the true Church, true repentance, feare, faith, prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, &amp;c. Theſe kindes of worſhip are eſpeciallie required, and commended in the Scripture. Pſal 49. <hi>Offer vnto God the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of praiſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdlie, by this faith, which doth comforte the heart in repentance, we doe receiue the ſpirit of God, who is giuen vs to be our gouernour &amp; helper, that we ſhould reſiſt ſinne and the deuill, and more and more acknowledge our owne weakenes, and that the knowledge and feare of God, and faith maie increaſe in vs: wherefore our obedience to God

and a new life ought to increaſe in vs, as Saint Paull ſaith, <hi>We muſt be renued to the knowledge of God,</hi> that the new lawe maie be wrought in vs, and his Image, which hath created vs, be renued, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Fourthlie, we teach alſo how this obedience, which is but begunne onelie and not perfect, doth pleaſe God. For in this ſo great infirmitie, and vncleannes of nature, the Saints doe not ſatisfie the law of God. The faithfull there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore haue neede of comforte, that they maie know how their ſlender and imperfect obedience doth pleaſe God. It doth not pleaſe him, as ſatisfying his lawe, but becauſe the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons themſelues are reconciled &amp; made righteous through Chriſt, and doe beleeue that their weaknes is forgiuen them, as Paull teacheth, <hi>There is now no condemnation to them which are in Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> Albeit then that this new obedience is farre from the perfection of the Lawe, yet it is righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and is worthie of a rewarde, euen becauſe that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are reconciled. And thus we muſt iudge of thoſe works, which are indeed highlie to be commended, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie * that they be neceſſarie, that they be the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice <note place="margin">Looke the 7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> obſeru. vp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</note>of God, and ſpirituall ſacrifices, and doe deſerue a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde: Neuertheles this conſolation is firſt to be held tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the perſon, which is verie neceſſarie in the conflict of the conſcience, to weere, that we haue remiſſion of ſinnes freelie by faith, and that the perſon is iuſt, that is, reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and an heire of eternall life through Chriſt, and then that our obedience doth pleaſe God, according to that ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Now ye are not vnder the law, but vnder grace.</hi> For our workes maie not be ſet againſt the wrath and iudgement of God: But the terrours of ſinne and death muſt be ouercome by faith and truſt in the mediatour Chriſt, as it is written, <hi>O death, I will be thy death.</hi> and Iohn. 6. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>This is the will of the Father, which ſent me, that euerie one which ſeeth the ſonne, and beleeueth in him, ſhould haue life euerlaſting.</hi> and S. Paull. <hi>Being iuſtified by faith, we haue peace with God.</hi> and the Church alwaies praieth, <hi>forgiue vs our treſpaſſes.</hi> And thus do the fathers teach, concerning the weaknes of the ſaints, and concerning faith. Auguſtine in his expoſition of the 30. Pſalm. ſaith. <hi>Deliuer me in thy righteouſnes. For there is a righteouſnes of God, which is made ours, when it is giuen vnto vs.</hi>
                     <pb n="474" facs="tcp:8251:127"/>
                     <hi>But therefore is it called the righteouſnes of God, leſt man ſhould thinke that he had a righteouſnes of himſelfe. For, as the Apoſtle Paull ſaith, To him that beleeueth in him that iustifieth the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, that is, that of a wicked maketh a righteous man, If God ſhould deale by the rule of the law, which is ſet forth vnto vs, he muſt needs be condemned: If God ſhould as it were deale by the rule propounded in the law, whom ſhould he deliuer? for he findeth al men to be ſinners. So ſaith Paul: Al haue ſinned, &amp; ſtand in need of the glory of god. What is this to ſtand in need of Gods glorie? That he ſhould deliuer thee, &amp; not thou thy ſelfe. For thou canst not deliuer thy ſelfe. Thou haſt need of a Sauiour. Why doeſt thou vaunt thy ſelfe? what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth thee to preſume of the law and of righteouſnes? Seeſt thou not that which doeth fight within the? doeſt thou not heare one that ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, and confeſſeth his weaknes, and deſireth aide in the battell? O miſerable man that I am? &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now it may eaſilie be perceiued, how needefull this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is for the Church, that men may know, that they doe not ſatisfie the law of God and yet may haue true comforte, knowing how their imperfect obedience doth pleaſe God. This doctrine hath beene horriblie darkened, and ſuppreſſed heretofore by certeine fond perſwaſions, wherein vnlearned men haue imagined againſt the authoritie of the ſcripture that they can fullfill the law of God, and that they are iuſt through the fullfilling of the law, &amp;c. And that Monkes are perfect, and doe performe more notable &amp; worthie workes, then the law doth require. In the meane while there is not a worde, how the Mediatour Chriſt is to be apprehended by faith: but they willed man to doubt, or elſe to truſt in his own workes. But as touching this obedience, we doe teach, <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 3. obſeruat. vpon this confeſſ.</note>that they which commit mortall ſinnes are not iuſt, becauſe god requireth this obedience that we ſhould reſiſt ſinnefull luſts. They then which ſtriue not againſt them, but obeie them, contrarie to the commaundement of God, and doe things againſt their conſciences, they are vnrighteous, and doe neither retaine the holy ſpirit, nor faith, that is, confidence and truſt of gods mercie. For confidence, which ſeeketh remiſſion of ſinnes, cannot ſo much as be in ſuch, as are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with their ſinnes, and remaine without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>

Fiftlie this point is needfull alſo to be taught, by what meanes men maie doe good workes. We ſhewed a litle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore how our workes doe pleaſe God.

And for that cauſe are men taught, that in the Goſpell the holie ſpirit is promiſed, who ſhal aide and gouerne the mindes of them, who do repent &amp; beleeue the Goſpel. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in ſo great infirmitie of nature, in the middeſt of theſe aſſaultes of Sathan, and in all daungers, faith muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in calling vpon God, euen throughout our wholl life, that we maie continue alwaies in the faith, &amp; in our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence towards God.

                  <p>There is no doubt but true vertues are the giftes of Go, ſuch as are, faith, clearenes of iudgement in diſcerning of pointes of religion, courrage of minde, ſuch as is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite in them which teach &amp; profeſſe the Goſpel, true care &amp; paines in gouerning of Churches, true humilitie, not to hunt after preferment, not to be puft vp with populare praiſe, nor caſt downe with their diſliking and ill will, true charitie, &amp;c.

Vnto theſe giftes we muſt ioyne our exerciſe which maie both preſerue the ſame, and deſerue an increaſe of them: according to the ſaying: <hi>To him that hath, ſhal be giuen.</hi> And it is notably ſaid of Auguſtine. <hi>Loue deſerueth an increaſe of loue</hi> to weet, when tis put in vſe. For good workes haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes, as in this life, ſo alſo after this life, in the euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting life. Now becauſe that the Church in this life is ſubiect to the croſſe, and to the death of the bodie, therefore many rewardes are differred vntill the life to come, which though it be vndoubtedlie beſtowed through mercy for Chriſts ſake on thoſe which are iuſtified by the faith of Chriſt, yet there is alſo a rewarding of good workes, according to that ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>your rewarde is great in heauen.</hi> By this it is euident, that the doctrine of good workes, is through the goodnes of God purelie and truelie taught in our Churches. How full of obſcuritie and confuſion the doctrine of good workes was in former times, all godlie mindes know full well. There was none that put men in minde of the difference of mans tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and the lawe of God: none that taught, how good workes did pleaſe God, in this ſo great infirmitie of ours.

                     </gap> iudges of this matter. In former ages mens conſciences were vexed with the doctrine of works, they neuer heard any comfort out of the Goſpell. Whereupon conſcience draue ſome into Monaſteries, hoping there to merit fauour by a monaſticall life. Others found out other workes, whereby to merit fauour, &amp; to ſatisfie for ſinne. There was verie great neede therefore to teach this doctrine of faith in Chriſt, and after ſo long time to renew it, to the end that fearefull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences might not want comfort, but might know, that grace and forgiuenes of ſinnes and iuſtification were appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended and receiued by faith in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Another thing, which we teach men, is, that in this place the name of <hi>Faith</hi> doth not onelie ſignifie a bare knowledge of the hiſtorie, which maie be in the wicked, and is in the Deuill, but it ſignifieth a faith, which beleeueth, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie the hiſtorie, but alſo the effect of the hiſtorie, to weete, the article of remiſſion of ſinnes, namelie, that by Chriſt we haue grace, righteouſnes, and remiſſion of ſins.

As for the deuilles, and the wicked, they can neuer beleeue this article of the remiſſion of ſinns. And therefore they hate God as their enimie, they call not vpon him, they looke for no good thing at his handes. After this manner doth Auguſtine admoniſh his reader touching the name of faith, and teacheth, that this word faith, is taken in the
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:8251:129" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſcriptures, not for ſuch a knowledge, as is in the wicked, but for a truſt and cofidence, which doth comfort and cheare vp diſquieted mindes.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer our deuines do teach, that it is requiſite to doe good workes, not for to hope to deſerue grace by them, but becauſe it is the will of God that we ſhould do them. And becauſe that the holie ſpirit is receiued by faith, our hartes are preſentlie renued, and doe put on new affections, ſo as they are hable to bring forth good workes. For ſo ſaith Ambroſe, <hi>Faith is the breeder of a good wil and of good actions</hi> For mans powers, without the holie ſpirit, are full of wicked af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and are weaker then that they can do anie good deede before God. Beſides, they are in the deuilles power, who driueth men forward into diuers ſinnes, into profane opinions, and into very hainous crimes. As was to be ſene in the Philoſophers, who aſſaying to liue an honeſt life, could not attaine vnto it, but defiled themſelues with open and groſſe faultes. Such is the weaknes of man, when he is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith and the holie ſpirit, &amp; hath no other guide, but the naturall powers of man. Hereby euerie man maie ſee that this doctrine is not to be accuſed, as forbidding good works, but rather is much to be commended, becauſe it ſheweth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter what ſorte we muſt doe good workes For without faith the nature of man can by no meanes performe the workes of the firſt and ſecond table. Without faith it cannot call vpon God, hope in God, beare the croſſe, but ſeeketh helpe from man, and truſteth in mans helpe.

Againe, what can be more miſerable, then either to obſcure, or to be ignorant of this great benefit, namelie the Remiſſion of ſinnes, and deliuerance from eternall death? ſeing that there is no difference betwixt the Church and other men, when as the light is extinguiſhed, concerning free Remiſſion of ſinnes, for the Sonnes ſake, and concerning Faith, whereby Remiſſion muſt be receiued: neither is there anie other comfort drawing vs back from eternall death, neither can there be anie true Inuocation, without this comfort: &amp; God himſelfe hath ſo often commaunded, that his Sonne ſhould be heard, and the Goſpell kepte, which is a wonderfull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, brought forth out of the ſecret counſell of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, when it was hidde from all creatures; therefore it is moſte neceſſarie, that the true doctrine, touching remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſinnes, ſhould be kept vndefiled.</p>
                  <p>But in all ages, euen from our firſt fathers time, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils haue ſcattered ſubtill deluſions, againſt the true do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, concerning the Sonne of God, and eſpeciallie in this article, whome notwithſtanding God hath oftentimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed, good teachers being againe raiſed vp, that the Church might not vtterlie periſh. Adam, Seth, Noe, Sem, Abraham, Iſaac, Iacob, and others after them, did ſhewe the true difference, betwixt the Church of God and other men, and taught that to the Church was giuen the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, touching the Mediatour the Sonne of God, and tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Remiſſion of ſinnes, and that this Remiſſion is to be receiued freelie, for the Mediatours ſake: And they tied In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation to this God, which had manifeſted himſelfe by giuing a promiſe, concerning the Mediatour, and they had externall rites giuen them of God, which were ſignes of the promiſe, and the ſinewes of the publike Congregation.
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:8251:130" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Theſe rites did a great parte of the multititude imitate, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the doctrine of the promiſes &amp; faith: and when they had deuiſed this perſuaſion, that men by obſeruing theſe rites might deſerue remiſſion of ſinnes, they heaped vp ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie ceremonies, and by litle and litle boldnes went ſo farre (as commonlie it commeth to paſſe) that diuers men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed diuers Gods. So the heathen departed from the true Church of god, and from the knowledge of the true god, and the promiſe of the Redeemer.</p>
                  <p>The ſame thing alſo hapned after Moſes his time. Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies were appointed for this cauſe, that they ſhould be admonitions of the Mediatour, of the Doctrine of Faith, of free remiſſion for the Mediatours ſake. But they feigned that ſinnes were forgiuen for thoſe rites and ſacrifices, and by this ſuperſtition they heaped vp ſacrifices, and forgot the Mediatour, and were without true comfort, and without true inuocation. The ſame thing hapned alſo after the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles time, the light of the goſpell being loſt, wherein is propounded free remiſſion for the Mediatours ſake, and that to be receiued by Faith. They ſought remiſſion by Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſticall exerciſes, by ſingle life, by diuers obſeruations, by the offering in the Maſſe, by the interceſſion of dead men, and manie monſtrous ſuperſtitions were deuiſed, as the hiſtories of the wholl Church which ſucceeded the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles doe declare. Againſt theſe errours the infinite mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of God hath oftentimes reſtored the voice of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell. And as among the people of Iſraell he did often raiſe vp Prophets, which ſhould purge the doctrine diligentlie, ſo in the Church, after the Apoſtles time, when the writings of Origen and Pelagius, and the ſuperſtition of the people had corrupted the puritie of the goſpell, yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, as in a miſt, the light of the goſpell was againe kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled by Auguſtine, and him followed Proſper, Maximus, and others, who reprooued the falſe opinions touching this Article. Afterward when the Monkes were ſprong vp, and that opinion, which faigneth men to merit by their workes, was a freſh ſpread abroad, yet there were ſome of a better iudgement, although they added ſtable to the foundation: as Hugo, Bernard, Gilbert, William of Paris, Tauler, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe, Weſell, and others in other places.

it is, like vnto the leafe of a figge tree, wherewith our firſt parentes after their fall did couer their nakednes: neither doth it anie more take awaie ſinne, and the corruption of nature and death, then thoſe figge leaues did.

And if they be children, they are alſo the heiresof God.</hi> Yet notwithſtanding, this alſo is true, <note n="*" place="margin">looke the 1. obſeruat. vpon this confeſſ. in the 4.

                  <p>Moreouer, god hath added vnto good workes certaine promiſes of his, and therefore euen for the good workes of holie men, God doth giue ſpirituall and corporall gifts euen in this life, and that diuerſelie, as it ſeemeth good to his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable wiſedome. 1.

Therefore he giueth ſometime a gouernment not troubleſome, peace, a fruitfull land, &amp; other good thinges, for the prayers of holie men, for their diligence, and for common neceſſities ſake: as, for Ioſeph, Naaman, &amp; Daniel, thoſe kingdomes, wherein they liued, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Now god will haue vs to vnderſtand that theſe benefits are neceſſarie for the bodie, and to know that they be giuen of god: in asking of them he will haue our faith to be exerciſed, as we ſhall declare more at large in a fit place.

                  <p>THeſe thinges we will not haue men ſo to vnderſtand, as though we placed ſaluation &amp; righteouſnes in the ſlothful thoughtes of men, or in faith deſtitute of loue (which they call faith without forme) ſeeing that we are ſure, that no man can be iuſt or ſaued, except he doe chieflie loue, &amp; moſte earneſtlie imitate God. <hi>For thoſe which he knew before, he alſo predeſtinated to be made like to the image of his Sonne.</hi> But no man can loue God aboue all thinges, and worthelie imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate him, but he which doth indeede knowe him, and doth aſſuredlie looke for all good things from him. Therefore we cannot otherwiſe be iuſtified, that is, as to become righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, ſo to be ſaued (for righteouſnes is euen our ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) then by beeing endued chiefelie with faith in him, by which faith we beleeuing the Goſpell, and therefore being perſwaded, that God hath taken vs for his adopted chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:8251:141"/>
and that he will for euer ſhewe himſelfe a louing fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnto vs, let vs whollie depende vpon his pleaſure. This faith Saint Auguſtine doth call, in his booke <hi>De Fide &amp; operibus, Euangelicall,</hi> To wit, that which is effectuall through loue. By this faith we are borne againe, and the image of God is repaired in vs. By this Faith, whereas we are borne corrupt, our thoughtes, euen from our childhoode, beeing altogether bent vnto euill, we become good, and vpright. For hereupon, we beeing fullie ſatisfied with one God (the ſpring of all good thinges that is neuer drie, but runneth alwaies moſt plentifullie) we doe forthwith ſhew our ſelues, as it were, Gods, towardes others, that is, toward the true ſonnes of god, indeauouring by loue to profit them, ſo much as in vs lieth. For, <hi>He that loueth his brother, abideth in the light, and is borne of God,</hi> and is wholie giuen to the new, and to the olde commaundement, touching mutuall loue. And this loue is the fullfilling of the wholl law, as Paul ſaith: <hi>The wholl law is fulfilled in one worde, namelie this, Thou ſhalt loue thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as thy ſelfe.</hi> Gal. 5. For whatſoeuer the law teacheth, hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto it tendeth, and this one thing it requireth, that at the length we maie be reformed to the perfect image of god, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good in all things, &amp; readie and willing to do men good, the which we can neuer doe, except we be adorned with all kindes of vertues. For who can purpoſe and doe all thinges (as the duetie of a Chriſtian doth require, 1. Cor. 10.) to the true edifying of the Church, and the ſound profit of all men, that is, according to the lawe of God, and to the glorie of god, except that he both thinke, ſpeake, and doe euerie thing in order, and well, and therefore be verie familiarlie acquainted with the wholl companie of vertues.</p>

                  <p>NOw it cannot be doubted of, what be the dueties of a Chriſtian man, and to what actions he ought chiefelie to giue him ſelfe, namelie to all thoſe, wherby eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one, for his parte, maie profit his neighbours, and that firſt, in things pertaining to life eternall, that they alſo maie begin to know, worſhip, and feare god, and then in thinges pertaining to this life, that they maie want nothing which
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:8251:142"/>
is neceſſarie to the ſuſtenance of the bodie. For as the wholl lawe of god, which is a moſte abſolute commaundement of all righteouſnes, is breiflie contained in this one word, <hi>Thou ſhalt loue thy neighbour as thy ſelfe,</hi> ſo in the performance of this loue, it is neceſſarie that all righteouſnes ſhould be compriſed and perfited. Whereupon it followeth, that nothing at all is to be reckoned among the duties of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian man, which is not of force and effect to profit our neighbour, and euerie worke is ſo much the more belonging to the dutie of Chriſtian man, by how much his neighbour maie the more be profited thereby. Therefore next after Eccleſiaſticall functions, among the chiefe duties of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian man, we place the gouernment of the Common we ale, obedience to Magiſtrates (for theſe be referred to the common profit) that care which is taken for our wife, children, familie, and the honour which is due to parents, (becauſe that without theſe the life of man cannot conſiſt) and laſtlie, the profeſſion of good artes and of al honeſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, becauſe that except theſe be had in eſtimation, we ſhall be deſtitute of the greateſt good thinges, which are proper to mankinde.

Alſo there is but one heade of the bodie, which hath agreement with the bodie. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the church cannot haue any other heade beſide Chriſt. For as the Church is a ſpirituall bodie, ſo muſt it needs haue a ſpiritual heade like vnto it ſelfe. Neither can it be gouerned by any other ſpirit, then by the ſpirit of Chriſt. Wherefore <note place="margin">Coloſſ. 1.</note>Paul ſaith, <hi>And he is the head of his bodie the Church, who is the beginning, the firſt borne of the dead, that in al things he might haue</hi>

                  <hi>things grow vp into him which is the heade, that is Christ, by whome all the bodie being knit together receiueth increaſe.</hi> And therefore we do not allow of the doctrine of the Romiſh Prelates, who would make the Pope the generall Paſtour, and Supreame heade of the Cuhrch of Chriſt militant here on earth, and the verie Vicar of Chriſt, who hath (as they ſaie) al fullnes of power and ſoueraigne authoritie in the Church. For we
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:8251:144"/>
holde and teach, that Chriſt our Lorde is, and remaineth fill, the onelie vniuerſal Paſtour, and higheſt Biſhop, before God his father, and that in the Church he performeth all the duties of a Paſtour or Biſhop, euen to the worldes ende: and therefore ſtandeth not in neede of any other to ſupplie his roome, for he is ſaid to haue a ſubſtitute, which is abſent. But Chriſt is preſent with his Church, &amp; is the head that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth life thereunto. He did ſtraightlie forbid his Apoſtles &amp; their ſucceſſours al ſuperioritie or dominion in the Church. They therefore that by gaineſaying ſet themſelues againſt ſo manifeſt a trueth, and bring another kinde of gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into the Church, who ſeeth not that they are to be counted in the number of them, of whome the Apoſtles of Chriſt propheſied? as Peter 2.

               <p>Now by taking awaie the Romiſh head, we doe not bring any confuſion or diſorder into the Church: for we teach that the gouernement of the Church, which the Apoſtles ſet downe, is ſufficient to keepe the Church in due order, which from the beginning, while as yet it wanted ſuch a Romiſh heade, as is now pretended to keepe it in order, was not diſordered or full of confuſion. That Romiſh head doth mainteine in deede that tyrannie and corruption in the Church, which was brought into the Church.

               <p>They obiect againſt vs, that there haue beene great ſtrifes and diſſentions in our Churches, ſince they did ſeuer themſelues from the Church of Rome, and that therefore they can not be true Churches.

that God in his iuſt iudgement ſuffereth the tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of his worde, and the Catholique Faith, and his owne true worſhip to be ſo obſcured and defaced, that the Church ſeemeth almoſt quite raſed out, and not ſo much as a face <note place="margin">1.

               <p>Againe, not all, that are reckoned in the number of the Church, are ſaintes, and the liuelie and true members of the Church: for there be manie Hypocrits, which outward lie doe heare the worde of God, and publiquelie receiue the Sacramentes, and beare a ſhew to praie vnto God alone through Chriſt, to confeſſe Chriſt to be their onelie righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes: and doe ſeeme outwardlie to worſhippe God, and to exerciſe the dueties of charitie to the bretheren, and for a while through patience to indure in troubles &amp; calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: And yet they are altogether deſtitute of the inward il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination of the ſpirit of God, of faith, and ſinceritie of heart, and of perſeuerance or continuance to the ende.

Euen as trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours in a commonwealth before they be detected are coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the number of good Citizens: and as the cockell and darnell and chaffe are founde amongſt the wheate: and as wennes and ſwellinges are in a perfect bodie, when they <note place="margin">Math. 13.</note>are rather diſeaſes and deformities, then true members of the bodie.

and to a fielde, wherein is founde both darnell and good corne. We are to haue a ſpeciall regarde, that we iudge not raſhlie before the time, nor go about to exclude, caſt of, and cut awaie them, whom the Lord would not haue excluded, nor cut of, or whome without ſome damage to the Church, we cannot ſeparate from it. Againe we muſt be verie vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant, leſt that the godlie falling faſt a ſleepe, the wicked grow ſtronger, and doe ſome miſchiefe to the Church.</p>
               <p>Furthermore we teach, that it is carefully to be marked, wherein eſpeciallie the trueth and vnity of the Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth, leſt that we either raſhlie breede or nouriſh ſchiſmes in the Church. It conſiſteth not in outward rites and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, but rather in the trueth and vnity of the Catholike faith.

And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we reade in the auncient writers, that there was manifolde diuerſities of ceremonies, but that was alwaies free, neither did any man think that the vnity of the church was therby broken or diſſolued.

                  <p>THe chiefe duetie of this function is, to preach repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and remiſſion of ſinnes through Chriſte, without ceaſing to pray for the people, to giue them-ſelues verie diligentlie without wearines to holie ſtudies, and to the worde of God, and with the worde of God, as with the ſword of the ſpirit, and by all kinde of meanes to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute Sathan with deadlie hatred, and to weaken his force, to defend thoſe citizens of Chriſt which are ſound, and to admoniſh, reprehend, and puniſh thoſe that are infected and by a Godly conſent of them which are choſen out of the miniſters and the magiſtrate, by diſcipline to ſhut out, or by ſome other fitte meane to mulct thoſe, which proceed fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in wickednes, till ſuch time as they do repent and may be ſaued. For that is the returning to the Church for a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed Citizen of Chriſt, if hauing changed his minde and endeauour (whereunto all this diſcipline doth tende) he acknowledge &amp; confeſſe his errour, and doth now of his owne accord require holeſome diſcipline, and by his new endeuour of godlines doth reioyce all the godlie.</p>

                  <p>WE beleeue and confeſſe, that mankinde, by the onelie mercie of God, is iuſtified by faith through Chriſt, and that the almightie God, by the outward prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the goſpell, and the holie ſeales, doth declare, and ſet before our eies that ſaluation and happines, which Chriſt, without anie worke or merit of ours, hath purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for vs, and giuen frelie vnto vs. But we are vniuſtly ſuſpected of ſome as though we did attribute nothing to the preaching of the outward word, and to the ſacraments, or as though we did take that from them, which the Lord himſelfe doth attribute vnto them, &amp; by this means ſhould ouerthrow and aboliſh the ordering and guiding of thoſe thinges wh ch perteine to the Church: whereas on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie ſide we haue a chiefe regard vnto this that we neither

attribute too much nor too litle to theſe things. For we haue learned both out of the holy ſcriptures, &amp; alſo out of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike doctor Auſtine, <hi>That the ſoule is in miſerable ſeruitude if any man take or worſhip the ſignes in ſtead of the things which they ſignifie.</hi> And againe, <hi>That it is an errour, if anie man interpret them vnfruitfullie.</hi> We haue learned alſo that the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall giftes are not to be deſpiſed, becauſe of the internall giftes: knowing that Cornelius the Centurion was taught of God, and that yet notwithſtanding he was put ouer to to heare Peter the Apoſtle preach, &amp; to be baptiſed of him. Therefore that we maie walke in the high and plaine waie, that is, that we maie detract nothing from the word and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, which the ſcripture doth attribute vnto them, and againe that we may not giue that to the creature, which is proper to the Creator, &amp; that the ordinance of God may not be diſanulled, but al glorie maie be giuen to God alone: to conclude, leſt that by thoſe externall things inſtituted of God, we ſhould too much tie the mindes of the faithfull to thinges created, we ſo beleeue touching the miniſterie of the word and the Sacramentes, as wee haue profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, which thing alſo we do thus declare by that which followeth.</p>

There are certaine bonds and limites prefixed, within which both the Paſtours authoritie &amp; our obedience muſt conteine it ſelfe.

And ſurelie ſuch conceites as theſe, haue in all ages, from the beginning of the worlde, hurte the Church greatly and ſtill will hurt it.

And though it doe conteine a wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that is farre from reaſons teach, yet the word of the Prophets and Apoſtles is ſure and not doubtfull. Therefore Peter ſaith, <hi>Ye doe well in attending to the worde of the Prophets, as to alight in the darkenes</hi> Beſides the Church hath the gift of interpretation, that is, the vnderſtanding of the heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie doctrine, but that is not tied to the name or degree of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops: and therefore it is no power of interpreting like to the power of a Prince or higheſt Iudge.

Neither is it to be permitted to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one, although he be a ſpirituall Prieſt, to vſurpe a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like miniſterie in the Church, without a lawfull calling.

               <p>But the holie Scripture doth not teach vs, that Chriſt hath inſtituted in his Church ſuch Prieſtes, as ſhould be Mediatours betweene God and men, and pacifie the wrath of God towards men, by their ſacrifices, and apple the merit of Chriſt to the quicke and the dead, without the preaching of the Goſpell, and adminiſtration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes For if we will ſpeake of the great and true Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toure, <hi>There is but one Mediatour betweene God and men, Ieſus Chriſt the Sonne of God</hi>

If we will ſpeake of the Mediatour of praying euery godly man is made a Mediatour ech for other through Ieſus, becauſe that their duetie doth require, that they ſhould commend one anothers health to God in their praiers: the which dutie alſo then euery one doth performe, when they ſaie the Lordes prater in faith. If we ſpeake of the ſacrifices which do purge our ſinnes, and appeaſe the wrath of God, then is there one onelie ſacrifice, which doth purge vs, and reconcile God vnto vs, to wit, the ſacrifice of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, which was once made on the Croſſe. And as Chriſt doth die no more, death hath no more Dominios ouer him, ſo this ſacrifice of his ſhall neuer be made againe, but <hi>by his one oblation,</hi> as it is written in the Epiſtle to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes, <hi>He hath made perfect for euer thoſe that be ſanctifie.</hi> If we ſpeake of the remembrance of this one ſacrifice, and of the applieng of the merit thereof, then the publike mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Church, which doe teach the Goſpell publike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and adminiſter the Sacramentes according to the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Chriſt, doe not onelie make a true and right re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of this purging ſacrifice, but doe alſo applie, by their diſpenſation, the merit of this ſacrifice to all thoſe, that doe receiue the Goſpell and the Sacramentes by faith. Therefore we cannot ſee what vſe there is of thoſe kinde of men in the Church, which are ordained for this purpoſe, that they maie haue authoritie to ſacrifice for the quicke and the dead.

Theſe things doe our Preachers teach, touching the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of Eccleſiaſticall perſons: ſo that they haue great iniurie offered to them in that they are blamed, as though they ſought to bring the authoritie of Eccleſiaſticall prelats to nothing, whereas they neuer forbad them that worldlie gouernement and authoritie, which they haue. But they haue often wiſhed, that they would come nearer to the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall commaundements, and that either they them ſelues would inſtruct and faithfullie feede the conſciences of Chriſtians, out of the holie Goſpell, or that at the leaſt wiſe they would admit others hereunto, and ordeine ſuch as were more fitte for this purpoſe. This is it, I ſaie, that out Preachers haue oftentimes requeſted of the Prelates them ſelues, ſo faire haue they beene from oppoſing themſelues at anie time to their ſpirituall authoritie.</p>

               <p>Theſe Sacraments are either of the olde teſtament or of
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:8251:179"/>
the new. The ſacraments of the olde teſtament were cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, and the paſcall lambe, which was offered vp in ſacrifice and for that cauſe isreferred to the ſacrifices which were in vſe from the beginning of the world. The ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the new teſtament, are baptiſme and the ſupper of the Lord. Some there are which reckon ſeauen ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the newe teſtament. Of which number we graunt that repentance, matrimonie and the ordination of mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters (we meane not the popiſh but the Apoſtolicall ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) are verie profitable ordinances of God but no ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. As for confirmation and extreame vnction, they are meere deuiſes of men, which the Church may verie well want without anie damage or diſcommoditie at all: and therefore we haue them not in our Churches, becauſe there be certaine things in them which we can at no hand allow of. As for that marchandiſe which the Romiſh prelates vſe in miniſtring their ſacraments we vtterlie abhor it. The au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and inſtitutor of al ſacraments is not any man, but God alone, for men can by no meanes ordaine ſacramentes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they belong to the worſhip of God, and it is not for man to appoint and preſcribe a ſeruice of God, but to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace and retaine that which is taught vnto him by the Lord. Beſides, the ſacramentall ſignes haue Gods promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes annexed to them which neceſſarilie require faith, now faith ſtaieth it ſelfe onelie vpon the word of God. And the word of God is reſembled to writings or letters, the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to ſeales, which the Lord alone ſetteth to his owne letters: Now as the Lord is the author of the ſacraments, ſo he continually worketh in that Church, where they be right lie vſed, ſo that the faithfull when they receiue them of the miniſters do know that the Lord worketh in his owne ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and therfore they receiue them as from the hand of God: and the miniſters faults (if there be anie notorious in them) can not hurt them ſeeing they do acknowledge the goodnes of the ſacraments to depend vpon the ordinance of the Lord. For which cauſe they put a difference in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the ſacraments, betweene the Lord and the Lordes miniſters confeſſing that the ſubſtance of the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is giuen them of the Lorde, and the outward ſignes by the hands of the miniſters.</p>

Now the principall thing, that in all the Sacramentes is offered of the Lorde, and chieflie regarded of the godlie of all ages (which ſome haue called the ſubſtance and matter of the ſacraments) is Chriſt our ſauiour, <hi>That onely ſacrifice &amp; the lambe of God ſlaine from the beginning of the world, the rocke alſo of which all our Fathers drank, by whome all the elect are circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with circumciſion made without handes, through the holie ſpirit,</hi> and are waſhed from all their ſinnes, and are nouriſhed with the verie bodie and blood of Chriſt vnto eternall life.</p>
               <p>Now in reſpect of that, which is the cheife thing, and the verie matter and ſubſtance of the ſacraments, the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of both the teſtaments are equal. For Chriſt the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mediatour and ſauiour of the faithfull is the chiefe thing &amp; ſubſtance in them both, one and the ſame God is author of them both. They were giuen vnto both Churches, as ſignes and ſeales of the grace and promiſes of God, which ſhould call to minde and renew the memorie of Gods great benefits to them, and ſhould diſtinguiſh the faithfull from althe religions in the world: laſtly, which ſhould be receiued ſpirituallie by faith, and ſhould binde the receiuers vnto the Church, and admoniſh them of their duetie: In theſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſaie, &amp; ſuch like things, the ſacraments of both Churches be not vnequall, although in the outward ſignes they be diuerſe.</p>
               <p>And in deede we do yet put a greater difference between them: for ours are more firme &amp; durable, as thoſe which are not to be changed to the end of the world. Againe, ours te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie that the ſubſtance and promiſe is all readie fulfilled &amp; performed in Chriſt, whereas the other did onelie ſignifie that they ſhould be performed. And ours are more ſimple, &amp; nothing paineful, nothing ſo ſumptuous, nor ſo ful of ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies: Moreouer they belong to a greater people, that is diſperſed thorough the face of the wholl earth. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, becauſe they are more excellent, and do (by the ſpirit of God) ſtirre vp in vs a greater meaſure of faith, therefore a more plentifull meaſure of the ſpirite doth follow of them.</p>
               <p>But now ſince that Chriſt the true Meſſias is exhibited vn to vs, and the aboundance of grace is powred forth vpon the people of the new teſtament, the ſacraments of the olde law are ſurelie abrogated and ceaſed, and in their ſteed the ſacraments of the new teſtament are placed: namelie, for
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:8251:180"/>
circumciſion, Baptiſme, and for the paſcall lambe and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, the Supper of the Lord.</p>
               <p>And as in the olde Church the ſacraments conſiſted of the word, the ſigne, &amp; the thing ſignified, ſo euen at this day they ſtand as it were of the ſame parts. For the word of God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them Sacraments, which before were none: for they are conſecrated by the word, &amp; declared to be ſanctified by him who firſt ordeined them. To ſanctify or conſecrate a thing, is to dedicate it vnto god &amp; vnto holy vſes, that is, to take it fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the common and ordinarie vſe, and to appoint it to ſome ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie vſe. For the ſignes that be in the Sacraments are drawne from common vſe, to thinges eternall and inuiſible. As in baptiſme the outwarde ſigne is the element of water, and that waſhing is viſible, which is done by the miniſter. The thing <note n="*" place="margin">looke the 1. obſeruat. vpon this confeſſ.</note>ſignified is regeneration, &amp; the clenſing from ſinne. Likewiſe in the Lordes Supper, the outwarde ſigne is breade and wine, taken from things commonlie vſed for meate and drinke. The thing ſignified is <hi>the bodie of Chriſt, which was giuen, and his bloode which was ſhed for vs,</hi> and the communion of the bodie and bloode of the Lorde: wherefore, the water, bread, and wine, conſidered in their owne nature, and out of this holie vſe &amp; inſtitution of the Lord, they are onelie that which they are called, and which they were ſaide then to be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But let the word of God be once added to them together with inuocation vpon his holie name, and the renewing of their firſt inſtitution and ſanctification, &amp; then theſe ſignes are conſecrated and declared to be ſanctified by Chriſt. For Chriſtes firſt inſtitution and conſecration of the ſacraments ſtandeth yet in force in the Church of God, in ſuch ſort that they which celebrate the ſacraments, no otherwiſe then the Lord himſelfe from the beginning hath appointed, haue ſtil euen to this daie the vſe and benefit of that firſt and moſt excellent conſecration. And for this cauſe in the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſacraments the verie wordes of Chriſt are repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And foraſmuch as we learne out of the word of God, that theſe ſignes were appointed vnto an other end and vſe, then commonlie they are vſed vnto, therefore we teach that they now in this their holie vſe doe take vpon them the names of the thinges ſignified, and are not ſtill called bare water, bread or wine, but water is called regeneration, and <hi>waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
                  <pb n="381" facs="tcp:8251:180"/>
                  <hi>of the new birth,</hi> and the bread and wine the bodie and blood of the Lord, or the pledges and ſacraments of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and blood, not that the ſignes are turned into the things ſignified, or ceaſe to be that which in their owne nature they are, (for then they could not be ſacraments, which ſhould conſiſt onelie of the thing ſignified, and haue no ſignes) but therefore do the ſignes beare the names of the things, becauſe they be myſticall tokens of holie things: and becauſe that the ſignes and the things ſignified are ſacramentallie ioyned together: ioyned together, I ſay, or vnited by a myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſignification, and by the purpoſe and will of him, who firſt inſtituted them. For the water, bread and wine, are not common, but holie ſignes. And he that inſtituted water in baptiſme, did not inſtitute it with that minde and purpoſe, that the faithful ſhould onely be dipped in the water of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme: and he which in the ſupper commaunded the bread to be eaten, and the wine to be drunke, did not mean that the faithfull ſhould onelie receiue bread and wine, without anie further myſtery, as they eat bread at home in their own hou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſes, but that they ſhould ſpiritually be partakers of the things ſignified, and by faith be truelie purged from their ſinne and be partakers of Chriſt alſo.</p>
               <p>And therefore we cannot allowe of them which attribute the conſecration of the Sacraments to I know not what ſyllables, to the rehearſall of certaine wordes pronounced by him that is conſecrated, and that hath an intent of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrating, or to ſome other accidentall thinges, which are not left vnto vs either by the word, or by the example of Chriſt or his Apoſtles. We doe alſo miſlike the doctrine of thoſe, that ſpeake no otherwiſe of the Sacramentes, then of common ſignes, not ſanctified, nor effectuall. We condemne them alſo, who becauſe of the inuiſible thinges doe deſpiſe the viſible ſignes, and thinke them ſuperfluous, becauſe they doe alreadie enioy the thinges themſelues: ſuch were the Meſſalians, as it is recorded. We doe diſallow their doctrine alſo, who teach that grace and the things ſignified are to be ſo tied and included in the ſignes, that whoſoeuer doe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardlie receiue the ſignes, muſt needes inwardly partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate the grace and the thinges ſignified, what manner of men ſoeuer they be.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="382" facs="tcp:8251:181"/>
Notwithſtanding as we eſteeme not the goodnes of the ſacraments by the worthines or vnworthines of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, ſo likewiſe we doe not weigh them by the condition of the receiuers. For we knowe that the goodnes of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments doth depend vpon the faithfulnes or trueth and the meere goodnes of God. For euen as Gods worde remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the true worde of God, wherein not onelie bare words are vttered when it is preached, but therwithall the things ſignified by the words are offered of God, although the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and vnbeleeuers heare and vnderſtand the words, yet they enioy not the thinges ſignified, becauſe they receiue them not by a true faith: Euen ſo the ſacraments conſiſting of the worde, the ſignes, and the thinges ſignified, continue true and perfect Sacraments, not onlie becauſe they be holy things, but alſo for that God alſo offereth the things ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, howſoeuer the vnbeleeuers receiue not the thinges which are offered. This commeth to paſſe, not by anie fault in God, the author and offerer of them, but by the fault of men, who doe receiue them without faith, and vnlawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, <hi>whoſe vnbeleefe cannot make the truth of God of no effect.</hi>

are receiued by faith, as the ſignes be receiued with the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall mouth, &amp; the wholl fruit of the Sacraments is in the thing it ſelfe.

                  <p>SAcraments are viſible paterns, inſtituted of god, of the grace, good will, and promiſes of God towardes vs, ſure teſtimonies, and holie remembrances, the which vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der earthlie ſignes doe repreſent vnto vs, and ſet before our eies heauenlie giftes, and doe withdrawe the minde from earthlie to heauenlie thinges: moreouer, they be tokens of Chriſtian brotherhood and fellowſhippe. Therefore a ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not onelie a ſigne, but it is made of two thinges, to wit, of a viſible or earthlie ſigne, and of the thing ſignified, which is heauenlie: the which two although they make but one Sacrament, yet it is one thing which is receiued with the bodie, another thing which the faithfull minde, being taught by the ſpirit of god, doth receiue. For the ſignes and the thinges ſignified by the ſignes doe cleaue together onlie by a certaine myſticall meane, or, as others ſpeake, by a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall vnion: neither be they ſo made one, that one in nature is made the other, or that one is contained in the other. For either of them (the which thing alſo holie Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſius did acknowledge) doth keepe it owne proprietie. Therefore the outward ſignes are not the ſelfe ſame thing, ſubſtantiallie and naturallie, which they doe ſignifie, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do they giue it of themſelues, and by their owne power, no more then the miniſter doth, but the Lord vſeth the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, and the ſignes, and the word, to this ende, that of his meere grace, when, and ſo much as pleaſeth him, he maie repreſent, declare, <note n="*" place="margin">looke the 1. obſeru. vpon this confeſſ.</note>viſibilie ſhew, and ſet before our eies his heauenlie giftes, and all this according to his promiſe.</p>
                  <p>Now, as it doth derogate nothing from the miniſterie of the worde, when it is ſaide, that the outwarde preaching of
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:8251:182"/>
the worde doth profit nothing, except the inwarde husband man giue the increaſe, (for Paull ſaith, <hi>He that planteth, and he that watereth, is nothing, but god that giueth the increaſe,)</hi> ſo he doth not make the Sacraments of no effect, which ſaith, that not they, but God himſelfe doth purge vs, that is, which doth attribute the force of the ſacrament to the Creator. For Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſaide, <hi>Baptiſme doth ſaue vs:</hi> but he addeth, <hi>Not whereby the filth of the fleſh is waſhed away, but in that a good conſcience maketh requeſt vnto God.</hi> For as in other creatures, as in the Sunne, the Moone, the Starres, fire, pretious ſtones, hearbes, and ſuch like things, which God doth vſe as inſtrumentes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde vs, we ought not to put any confidence, nor admire them as the cauſes of any benefit: ſo our truſt ought not to reſt in outwarde ſignes, nor the glorie of God be transferred vnto them, as they be outwarde ſignes (howbeit the Lord doth vſe their helpe toward vs, and they be holie ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) but by them our truſt muſt lift vp it ſelfe to him, beeing both the author of the ſacramentes, and the Creator of all thinges. And ſeeing that the Sacraments are the inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and worke of the Lord himſelfe, the faithfull doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue them, not as certaine ſuperfluous inuentions of men, as at the hand of men, but as his heauenlie giftes, and that at the hand of the Lorde. For as touching the word of the Goſpell, which he preached, the Apoſtle writeth thus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>When yee receiued of vs the word, whereby ye learned God, yee did not receiue it as the word of men, but, as it was indeed, as the worde of God, who alſo worketh in you that beleeue.</hi> The like reaſon is there of the Sacramentes. Therefore as a little before we teſtified, that we doe, and alwaies did receiue theſe ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and ſpeaches of Scripture, touching the Miniſterie of the worde, <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 2 obſeruat. vpon this confeſſ.</note>the Miniſter doth conuert, remit ſinnes, open the eies and heartes of men, giue faith and the ſpirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well vnderſtood, we doe acknowledge alſo theſe ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, touching the Sacramentes, the Miniſter through Baptiſme doth regenerate, and waſh awaie ſinnes: he doth diſtribute, and giue the bodie and bloode of the Lord: For Ananias ſaide to Paull, <hi>Ariſe and be baptiſed, waſh awaie thy ſinnes, by calling on the name of Ieſus.</hi> Alſo, <hi>Ieſus tooke breade, gaue it to his Diſciples, and ſaid, this is my bodie.</hi> Alſo it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that the auncient Fathers, did vſe ſuch kinde of ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:8251:182"/>
becauſe that by this meanes they would propound and commend more royallie the giftes of God. Moreouer, ſeeing that the inſtitution and worke of the word and of the Sacraments proceedeth not from men, but from God, we do here reiect the errour of the Donatiſtes, and of the Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, who eſteemed the holie giftes of god according to the worthines, or vnworthines of the miniſter.</p>
                  <p>Now in that heauenlie giftes are repreſented vnto vs by earthlie things, it commeth ſo to paſſe by a certaine ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar goodnes of God, who by this meane would helpe our weakenes. For the weakenes of mans wit doth vnderſtande all things the better, if they be reſembled by viſible things. Therefore the Lord would by Sacramentes ſet before the eies of mortall men his heauenlie gifts and his promiſes, as it were a linelie picture in a certaine table: that is, thoſe things, which are perceiued by the minde, he deliuered to vs in ſenſible things.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon we doe gather, that the Sacramentes doe apperteine to them which are in the Church. For pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane men do ſcoffe at our Sacramentes, inſomuch as they eſteeme them according to the externall things onely. But they which haue faith, vnderſtand the myſteries of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments: and they which receiue them in a true and liuely faith, receiue them with fruit: if they be receiued without faith, they doe hurt: not that the good giftes of God doe hurte of themſelues, but becauſe that they being not recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued aright, doe hurte, through our default. Furthermore, the Sacraments are badges of the people of God. For by theſe we are gathered together into a holie companie, and we profeſſe our faith. For it pleaſed the Lord by this meane to gather his people to himſelfe, and as it were to marke them with this ſigne, whereby alſo he might put euerie one in minde of his duetie.</p>
                  <p>Now of this kinde there be two Sacramentes in the Church of Chriſt, <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> which is called <hi>the font of regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: and the ſupper of the Lord, which is called the bodie and blood of the Lord, or the communion of the bodie and blood of the Lord.</hi> And now we will ſpeake ſeuerallie of them: for hitherto we haue diſcourſed of the Sacraments in generall, as before God we do beleeue, and wherein we hope that Luther will

               <p>AS touching the Sacraments, we teach that they be externall, earthlie (as they which conſiſt of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) and viſible ſignes, conſecrated by the word of God, and by his owne mouth appointed hereunto, to ſignifie and witnes to vs that ſelfe ſame ſpirituall and inuiſible grace and trueth, whereof they haue the name, and which they are alſo ſacramentallie. Theſe ſacraments no man either did, or can inſtitute, but the Lord and God himſelfe Chriſt Ieſus, into whoſe handes the Father hath deliuered al things. And <note place="margin">Ioh. 13.</note>he hath inſtituted and appointed them for great and ſauing cauſes, and ſuch as are neceſſarie for this Church and all thoſe that beleeue: to wit, that like as by the preaching of the word, ſo by the adminiſtration of the viſible Sacraments and the myſteries thereof, faith might be helped and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, and that there might be an aſſured teſtimonie and confirmation of the fauourable and well pleaſed will of God towards vs, and that they might giue witnes to that trueth which is ſignified by them, and ſhould reach it out (as doth the word) to be apprehended by faith, and that the mindes of the faithfull, in the receiuing of them, ſhould by faith receiue the grace and trueth whereof they be witneſſes, and applying it vnto them-ſelues, ſhoulde make it their owne, and confirme themſelues therein, and on the other ſide, by giuing themſelues to God, ſhould conſecrate, and as it were by an othe religiouſlie binde them ſelues, to ſerue him alone, and as it were be ioyned together among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, by the ioyning and knitting, as of one ſpirit, ſo alſo
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:8251:183"/>
of one body, to wit, of the Church, of the fellowſhip of ſaints, <note place="margin">Eph. 4.</note>and of loue.</p>
               <p>And according to theſe thinges, the Sacraments (as in times paſt Circumciſion was) may be called the holie co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenants <note place="margin">Gen. 17.</note>of god with his Church, and of the Church with God, the minſters of faith and loue, by which the ioyning and vnion of God and Chriſt, our Lord with theſe beleeuing people, and theirs againe with Chriſt, is made and perfited, and that among themſelues in one ſpirituall bodie of the Church: by which alſo, euen as by the word, Chriſt, and his ſpirit do cauſe in the faithfull, that is, in thoſe that vſe them worthelie, a pretious participation of his excellent merit, neither doth he ſuffer them to be onelie bare and naked mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and ceremonies, but thoſe things that they ſignifie and witnes outwardlie, that doth he worke inwardlie, to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, profitablie, and effectuallie: that is, he clenſeth, nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth, ſatisfieth, looſeth, payeth, remitteth, &amp; confirmeth.</p>
               <p>They therefore which contemne theſe Sacraments, and through ſtubbornnes will not ſuffer them to be of anie force with themſelues, and making ſmall account of them, do e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme them as trifles, or do otherwiſe abuſe them, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to the inſtitution, will, or commaundement of Chriſt, all theſe do greeuouſlie ſinne againſt the author thereof, who hath inſtituted them, and make a verie great hazarde of their ſaluation. But if ſome man would willinglie vſe theſe ſacraments according to the inſtitution of Chriſt, and yet cannot haue leaue <note n="*" place="margin">looke the 1. obſeru. vp on this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</note>either entirelie, or withourt deceit, ſo to do as he would, as if peraduenture one that is taken be kept in priſon, or if one ſhould be hindred by ſicknes, or ſhould liue in ſtrange countries among the enemies of the trueth: ſuch a man, in ſuch a caſe, if he do whollie and truelie beleeue the holie Goſpell, maie by that faith be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, although he haue not the vſe of the Sacramentes: whereof Auguſtine vpon Iohn. cap. 16. hath this worthie ſaying, <hi>Beleeue, and thou haſt eaten:</hi> ſeeing that the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are not neceſſarie to ſaluation, but onelie by the addition of a certaine condition.</p>
               <p>Alſo we teach this, that the ſacraments of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, or by their owne vertue, for the workes ſake, or for the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie outward action, that is, for the bare participation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing,

and vſe thereof, can not giue grace, nor a iuſtifying or quickening faith to any, which before was not inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie quickened by the holie ghoſt, and hath no good motion within him-ſelfe: I ſaie, the Sacraments can not giue to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie ſuch either grace, or iuſtifying and quickening faith, and therefore they can not iuſtifie anie man, nor inwardlie quicken or regenerate anie mans ſpirit: for faith muſt goe before, whereby the holie ghoſt doth inwardlie quicken, and lighten man, and ſtirre vp or cauſe good motions in the heart. Without this faith there is neither anie iuſtification nor ſaluation: neither do the Sacraments of, or by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, helpe anie whit hereunto, as in the holy ſcripture ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt examples of this matter are found in manie places, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in Iudas, who receiued the ſacrament of the Lord <note place="margin">Iohn. 13.</note>Chriſt him-ſelfe, did alſo execute the function of a preacher, and yet he ceaſed not to remaine a Deuill, an hypocrite, and the loſt ſonne: neither was he made better by the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, or by the vſe thereof, neither did this profit his <note place="margin">Act. 5.</note>anie thing to ſaluation. Alſo in Ananias and his wife, who had beene baptized of the Apoſtles, and had alſo without doubt receaued the Lords ſupper, and yet notwithſtanding they did continue in their wickednes, iniuſtice, and lies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the holy ghoſt, the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes did neither take away their wickednes, nor giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſauing or iuſtifying faith, which maketh the heart the better by repenting, &amp; giueth it to God an vpright and obedient heart, and doth appeare the conſcience. Therefore the Sacramentes did not giue this conſcience and this faith vnto them: as Circumciſion, and the Sacrifices of the olde teſtament, did not giue a liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and iuſtifying faith, without the which faith thoſe thus auailed nothing to eternall ſaluation or iuſtification. And ſo doth Saint Paull ſpeake of all theſe thinges in his Epiſtle. <note place="margin">Rom. 4.</note>to the Romanes, and bringeth in the example of Abraham and doth witnes, that he had faith and righteouſnes, which is auaileable with God, before that he was circumciſed. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

For baptiſme once receiued doth continue all a mans life, and is a perpetuall ſealing of our adoption vnto vs. For to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized in the name of Chriſt, is to be enrolled, entered, and
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:8251:188"/>
receiued into the couenant, and familie, and ſo into the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of the ſonnes of God, yea &amp; in this life to be called after the name of God, that is to ſaie, to be called the Sonne of god, to be purged alſo from the filthines of ſins, &amp; to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with the manifolde grace of God, for to lead a new and innocent life. Baptiſme therefore doth call to minde, and keepe in remembrance the great benefit of God performed to mankinde: for we are al borne in the pollution of ſinne, and are the Sonnes of wrath. But God, who is rich in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, doth freelie purge vs from our ſinnes, by the blood of his Sonne, and in him doth adopte vs to be his ſonnes, and by an holie couenant doth ioyne vs to himſelfe, and doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich vs with diuers giftes, that we might liue a new life. All theſe thinges are ſealed vp vnto vs in Baptiſme. For inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie we are regenerated, purified, and renued of God through the holie Spirit: and outwardlie we receiue the ſealing of moſte notable gifts, by the water, by which alſo, thoſe great benefites are repreſented, and, as it were, ſet before our eyes to be looked vpon. And therefore are we baptized, that is, waſhed and ſprinckled with viſible water. For the water maketh cleane that which is filthie, refreſheth things that faile and faint, and cooleth the bodies. And the grate of God dealeth in like manner with the ſoule, and that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſible, and ſpirituallie.</p>
               <p>Moreouer by the Sacrament of Baptiſme God doth ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate vs from all other religions and people, and doth conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate vs a peculiar people to himſelfe. We therefore by being baptized, doe confeſſe our faith, and are bound to giue vnto God obedience, mortification of the fleſh, and newnes of life, yea and we are billed ſouldiers for the holie warfare of Chriſt, that all our life long we ſhoulde fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the worlde, Sathan, and our owne fleſh: Moreouer, we are baptized into one bodie of the Church, that we might well agree with all the members of the Church in the ſame religion and mutuall duties.</p>

of Bapriſme. Of which kinde is exorciſme, and the vſe of lightes, oyle, ſalte, ſpattle, and ſuch other things, as namelie that baptiſme is twiſe euerie yere conſecrated with diuerſe ceremonies. For we beleeue that the baptiſme of the Church, which is but one, was ſanctifed in Gods firſt inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of it, and is conſecrated by the word, and is now of full force, by; and for the firſt bleſſing of God vpon it.</p>
               <p>We teach that baptiſme ſhould not be miniſtred in the Church by women or midwiues. For Paul ſecludeth women from Eccleſiaſticall callings: but Baptiſme belongeth to Eccleſiaſticall offices. We condemne the Anabaptiſts, who denie that young infants, borne of faithfull parents, are to be baptized. For according to the doctrine of the goſpell <hi>theirs is the kingdome of God.</hi> And they are writen in the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of God. And why then ſhoulde not the ſigne of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant be giuen to them? Why ſhould they not be conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by holy baptiſme, who are gods peculiar people, &amp; in the Church of God? We condemne alſo the Anabaptiſts in the reſt of their opinions, which they peculiarlie doe holde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the worde of God. We therfore are not Anabaptiſts, neither doe we agree with them in any point that is theirs.</p>

               <p>This is further alſo taught, that they who are once law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie and truely baptized, when they come to yeares, ought to do their endeuour, that they may learne to acknowledge and know what holie Baptiſme is, and therewithall the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike and Chriſtian faith (without which Baptiſme auai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth nothing) to the end that afterward when they do deſire to be partakers of the Lord his Supper, they may with their owne mouthes, and of their owne accorde, make profeſſion of their faith, and may renew their ſanctification, by which they were conſecrated to the Lord. And ſuch, that is, which are thus inſtructed, our miniſters receiue vnto this couenant of holie Baptiſme, and <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 1. obſeru. vp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pon this confeſſ.</note>by the laying on of hands do teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy to them, that grace is conteined in baptiſme to ſtrengthen them to the warfarre of faith, and ſo after a conuenient and godlie manner, and with vſe of pure ceremonies, and ſuch as are profitable to edifying, they bring them to the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, without any reiteration of Baptiſme, as there are euident tokens and examples to be ſeene of this matter in the primitiue Church, which is the true and beſt maiſtreſſe of the poſterie, and goeing before leadeth vs the waie.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Supper of the Lord (which is alſo called the Lords table, and the Euchariſt, that is, a thankſgiuing) is therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monlie called a ſupper, becauſe it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted of Chriſt in that his laſt ſupper, and doth as yet repreſent the ſame, and in it the faithfull are ſpirituallie fed and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed: For the author of the ſupper of the Lord, is not an Angell or man, but the verie ſonne of God our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, who did firſt of all conſecrate it to his Church. And the ſame bleſſing &amp; conſecration doth ſtil remaine amongſt all thoſe who celebrate no other ſupper, but onelie that, which the Lord did inſtitute, &amp; at that do recite the words of the ſupper of the Lord, and in all things looke vnto Chriſt onelie by a true faith, at whoſe hands as it were they doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that which they do receiue, by the miniſterie of the miniſters of the Church. The Lord by this ſacred rite would haue that great benefit to be kept in freſh remembrance, which he did for mankinde, to weet, that by giuing vp his bodie to death, and ſhedding his blood, he hath forgiuen vs all our ſinnes and redemed vs from eternall death and the power of the deuill, and doth now feede vs with his fleſh and giueth vs his blood to drink, which things being appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:8251:197"/>
hended ſpirituallie by a true faith, doe nouriſh vs vp to life euerlaſting. And this ſo great a benefit is renued, ſo oft as the ſupper is celebrated. For the Lord ſaid, <hi>Doe this in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this holy Supper alſo it is ſealed vp vnto vs, that the very body of Chriſt was truelie giuen vp for vs, and his blood was ſhed for the remiſſion of our ſinnes, leſt that our faith might ſomewhat wauer. And this is outwardlie repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto vs, by the miniſter, in the ſacrament, after a viſible manner, and as it were laid before our eies to be ſeene, which is inwardlie in the fonte muiſiblie performed by the holie Ghoſt. Outwardlie bread is offered by the miniſter, and the wordes of the Lord are heard, <hi>Receiue, eate, this is my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, take it, and deuide it amongeſt you: drink ye all of this, this is my blood.</hi> Therefore the faithfull do receiue that which is giuen by the miniſter of the Lord, &amp; do eat the bread of the Lord, &amp; drinke of the Lordes cuppe. But yet by the working of Chriſt through the holy ghoſt, they receiue alſo the fleſh &amp; blood of the Lord, and do feede on them to life euerlaſting. For the fleſh &amp; blood of Chriſt is true meat &amp; drink vnto euerlaſting life, yea Chriſt himſelfe, in that he was deliuered for vs, and is our ſauiour, is that ſpecial thing and ſubſtance of the ſupper, and therefore we ſuffer no thing to be put in his place.</p>
               <p>But that it maie the better and more plainlie be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, how the fleſh and blood of Chriſt are the meat and drink of the faithfull, and are receiued by the faithfull to life euerlaſting, we will adde moreouer theſe four things. Eating is of diuerſe ſortes: for there is a corporall eating, whereby meat is taken into a mans mouth chewed with the teeth, and is ſwallowed downe into the bellie. After this manner did the Capernaits in times paſt think, that they ſhould eat the fleſh of the Lord, but they are confuted by him, Iohn. 6. For as the fleſh of Chriſt can not be eaten bodilie, without great wickednes &amp; crueltie, ſo is it not meat for the belly, as all men do confeſſe. We therfore diſalow that Canon in the Popes decrees, <hi>Ego Berengarius, de conſecrat. Distinct.</hi> 2, For neither did godlie antiquitie beleeue, neither yet doe we beleeue, that the bodie of Chriſt can be eaten corporal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and eſſentiallie, with a bodilie mouth.</p>
               <p>There is alſo a ſpirituall eating of Chriſts bodie, not ſuch
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:8251:197"/>
a one, whereby it maie be thought, that the verie meat is changed into the ſpirit, but wherby (the Lords body &amp; blood remaining in their own eſſence and propriety) thoſe things are ſpiritually communicated vnto vs, not after a corporall, butafter a ſpiritual manner through the holy Ghoſt, who dothapply and beſtow vpon vs thoſe things (to wit, remiſſion of ſinnes, deliuerance, and life euerlaſting, which are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for vs by the fleſh and blood of our Lord, which were giuen for vs: ſo as Chriſt doth now liue in vs, and we liue in him, and doth cauſe vs to apprehend him by a true faith, to this end, that he maie become vnto vs ſuch a ſpirituall meat and drink, that is to ſaie, our life. For euen as corporal meat and drinke do not onelie refreſh and ſtrengthen our bodies, but alſo do keepe them in life, euen ſo the fleſh of Chriſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered, &amp; his blood ſhed for vs, do not only refreſh &amp; ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then our ſoules, but alſo do preſerue them aliue, not becauſe <note place="margin">*Looke the 1 obſeruat. vpon this confeſſ.</note>they be corporallie eaten &amp; dronken, but for that they are communicated vnto vs ſpirituallie by the ſpirit of God, the Lord ſaying, <hi>The bread which I wil giue is my fleſh, which I wil giue for the life of this world:</hi> alſo, <hi>my fleſh</hi> (to wit, corporally eaten) <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fiteth nothing, it is the ſpirit which giueth life.</hi> And, <hi>the words which I ſpeake to you, are ſpirit and life.</hi> And as we muſt by eating re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the meat into our bodies, to the end that it maie work in vs, and ſhew his force in our bodies, becauſe while it is without vs, it profiteth vs not at all; euen ſo it is neceſſarie, that we receiue Chriſt by faith, that he maie be made ours, and that he maie liue in vs, and we in him. For he ſaith, <hi>I am the bread of life, he that commeth to me, ſhall not hunger, and he that beleeueth in me, ſhall not thirſt anie more.</hi> And alſo, <hi>He that eateth me, ſhall liue through me, and he abideth in me, and I in him.</hi> By all which it appeareth manifeſtlie, that by ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all meat we meane not, an Imaginarie, but the verie bodie of the Lord Ieſus, giuen to vs, which yet is receiued of the faithfull, not corporallie, but ſpiritually, by faith: in which point we do wholie follow the doctrine of our Lord and ſaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt, In the 6. of Iohn. And this eating of the fleſh, &amp; drinking of the blood of the Lord, is ſo neceſſary to ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on, that without it no man can be ſaued. This ſpiritual eating &amp; drinking is alſo without the ſupper of the Lord, euen ſo of<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ten as, &amp; wherſoeuer a man doth beleeue in Chriſt. To which

               </p>
               <p>Beſides that former ſpirituall eating, there is a ſacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall eating of the bodie of the Lord, whereby the faithfull man is partaker, not onelie ſpirituallie and internallie, of the true bodie and blood of the Lord, but alſo outwardlie, by comming to the table of the Lorde, doeth receiue the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſacrament of the bodie and blood of the Lord True it is, that a faithfull man by beleeuing did before receiue the food that giueth life, and ſtil receiueth the ſame, but yet when he receiueth the ſacrament, he receiueth ſomething more. For he goeth on in continuall communication of the bodie and blood of the Lord, and his faith is dailie more and more kindled, more ſtrengthened, and refreſhed, by the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall nouriſhment. For while we liue, faith hath continuall encreaſings: and he that outwardlie doth receiue the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with a true faith, the ſame doth receiue not the ſigne onely, but alſo doth enioy (as we haue ſaid) the thing it ſelfe. Moreouer, the ſame man doeth obey the Lordes inſtitution and commaundement, and with a ioyfull minde giueth thankes for his and the redemption of all mankinde, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a faithfull remembrance of the Lordes death, and doth witnes the ſame before the Church, of which bodie he is a member. This alſo is ſealed vp to thoſe which receiue the ſacraments, that the body of the Lord was giuen &amp; his blood ſhed, not onelie for men in generall, but particularlie for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie faithfull communicant, whoſe meat and drink he is to life euerlaſting. But as for him that without faith commeth to this holy table of the Lord, he is made partaker of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament only, but the matter of the ſacrament, from whence commeth life &amp; ſaluation, he receiueth not at all: And ſuch men doe vnworthilie eat of the Lords table. <hi>Now they which do vnworthelie eat of the Lords bread and drink of the Lordes cuppe, they are giltie of the bodie and blood of the Lord, and they eat and drink it to their Iudgement.</hi> For when as they do not approch with true faith, they reproach &amp; deſpite the death of Chriſt, and therefore eat and drink condemnation, to themſelues.</p>
               <p>We doe not then ſo ioyne the bodie of the Lorde and his bloode with the bread and wine, as though we thought, that the bread is the body of Chriſt, more then after a ſacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:8251:198"/>
manner, or that the bodie of Chriſt doth lie hid corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallie vnder the bread, ſo as it ought to be worſhipped vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the formes of bread, or yet that he which receiueth the ſigne, receiueth the thing it ſelfe. The bodie of Chriſt is in the heauens, at the right hande of his Father. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our hearts are to be lifted vp on high, &amp; not to be fixed on the bread, neither is the Lorde to be worſhipped in the bread, though notwithſtanding the Lord is not abſent from his Church, when as they celebrate the Supper. The Sonne being abſent from vs in the heauens, is yet not withſtanding preſent amongſt vs effectuallie. How much more Chriſt the ſonne of righteouſnes, though in bodie he be abſent from vs in the heauens, yet is preſent amongſt vs, not corporallie, but ſpirituallie, by his liuelie operation, and ſo, he himſelfe hath promiſed in his laſt ſupper to be preſent amongſt vs. Iohn. 14. 15. &amp; 16. Wherupon it followeth, that we haue not the Supper without Chriſt, and yet haue an vnbloodie and myſticall Supper, euen as all antiquitie called it.</p>
               <p>Moreouer we are admoniſhed, in the celebration of the ſupper of the Lord, to be mindeful of the body wherof we are made members, and that therfore we be at concord with all ourbrethren, that we may liue holily, &amp; not pollute our ſelues with wickednes, and ſtraunge religions, but perſeuering in the true faith to the ende of our life, giue diligence to excell in holines of life. It is therefore verie requiſite, that purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to come to the ſupper of the Lord, we do trie our ſelues, according to the commaundement of the Apoſtle, firſt with what faith we are indued, whether we beleeue that Chriſt is come to ſaue ſinners, and to call them to repentance, and whether each man beleeue that he is in the number of them, that being deliuered by Chriſt, are ſaued, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he haue purpoſed to chaunge his wicked life, to liue holilie, and perſeuére through Gods aſſiſtance in true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and in concord with his brethren, and to giue worthie thankes to God for his deliuerie, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>We think that rite, manner, or forme of the Supper to be the moſte ſimple and excellent, which commeth neareſt to the firſt inſtitution of the Lorde, and to the Apoſtles do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. VVhich doth conſiſt, in declaring the worde of God, in godlie prayers, the action it ſelfe that the Lorde vſed, and
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:8251:199"/>
the repeating of it, the eating of the Lordes body and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of his blood, the wholſome remembrance of the Lords death, and faithfull giuing of thanks, and in an holie fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in the vnion of the bodie of the Church. We therefore diſalow them, which haue taken from the faithfull one part of the ſacrament, to wit, the Lordes cuppe. For theſe doe verie grieuouſlie offend againſt the inſtitution of the Lorde, who ſaith, <hi>drinke you all of this,</hi> which he did not ſo plainlie ſaie of the bread. VVhat manner of Maſſe it was, that the Fathers vſed, whether it were tollerable, or intollerable, we doe not now diſpute. But this we ſaie freelie, that the Maſſe (which is now vſed throughout the Romiſh Church) for manie and moſte iuſt cauſes, is quite aboliſhed out of our Churches, which particularlie we will not now recite for breuities ſake. Truelie we could not like of it, becauſe that of a moſte wholſome action, they haue made a vaine ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, alſo becauſe it is made a meritorious matter, and is ſaid for monie: likewiſe becauſe that in it the Prieſt is ſaide to make the verie bodie of the Lorde, and to offer the ſame reallie, euen for the remiſſion of the ſinnes, of the quicke and the dead. Adde this alſo, that they doe it for the honor, worſhip, and reuerence of the ſainctes in heauen, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>THe Supper of the Lord is a Sacrament, to wit, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie inſtitution of the Lorde, whereby he doth renue and witnes vnto vs his bountifullnes, to wit, the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his bodie and bloode, and that by a viſible ſigne. For by bread and wine he doth declare vnto vs what he giueth, namelie himſelfe, to be the nouriſhment of our life: for he by his bodie and bloode doth feede vs to life eternall. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the verie gift of God (that is, the bodie and bloode of the Lord, to wit, the bodie of the Lord deliuered vnto death for vs, and his blood ſhed for the remiſſion of ſinnes) is the chiefeſt parte of this Sacrament. For the bodie and bloode of Chriſt is thus made or prepared to be the liuelie meate of our ſoules. The Sonne of god doth die in the fleſh for vs, that he might quicken vs, he poureth out his bloode, that he might clenſe vs from our ſinnes. To conclude, he raiſeth vp
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:8251:200"/>
his bodie from the dead, that our bodies maie receiue hope, and ſtrength to riſe againe. Thus therfore doth the Lorde offer himſelfe to be eaten and poſſeſſed of vs, and not a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine falſe imagination of a man, or an idle picture, in his ſteade. For, beſide him there is nothing in heauen, or in earth, that maie feede and ſatiate our ſoules. Now we do indeed eat the bodie, and we do indeed drink the blood of our Lorde, but not ſo rawlie, as the Papiſtes haue hitherto taught, to wit, the breade being chaunged into naturall fleſh, ſubſtantiallie (that is, corporallie, or carnallie) or the bodie being included in the bread, but ſpirituallie, that is after a ſpirituall manner, and with a faithfull minde. The Lorde is eaten indeed, and with fruite, by faith, that now he maie liue wholie in his, and his in him.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer, theſe holie gifes of God (which are not giuen of anie other, then of the Lorde himſelfe) according to the inſtitution of the Lord, are repreſented vnto vs by viſible ſignes, to wit, breade and wine, and offered to our ſenſes, not that we ſhould reſt in them, but that our weakenes maie be helped, and we maie lift vp our heartes vnto the Lorde, knowing that here we muſt thinke vpon greater thinges, to wit, not of eating bread, or drinking wine, but of receiuing the Lord himſelfe, with all his giftes, by a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full minde. Therefore when the gueſtes ſee the bread on the borde, they ſet their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> vpon the bodie of Chriſt, when they ſee the cuppe, they ſet their mindes vpon the bloode of Chriſt: when they ſee the breade broken, and the wine poured out, they conſider how that the bodie of Chriſt was tormented, and his bloode poured out for their ſakes: as by breade the bodies are nouriſhed and ſtrengthened, as by wine the mindes are made merie; ſo the godlie doe beleeue, that by the bodie of the Lorde, deliuered vnto death for them, they are fed to euerlaſting life alſo, that by his blood poured out vpon the croſſe, their conſciences are renewed: to conclude, they do feel the quickning power of Chriſt, which doth confirme them. In this ſorte is the ſupper of the Lord, accompliſhed ſpirituallie, thus are the bread and wine a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament vnto vs, and not bare and naked ſignes. Hereupon now ariſeth a verie great reioycing, and thankeſgiuing, for ſo great benefits, alſo apraiſing, and confeſſing of the name
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:8251:200"/>
of God: here thoſe workes, which the Lorde once finiſhed, are renued, and repreſented: but eſpeciallie the death of the Lorde is repeated, which although it once hapned, and now is paſt, yet vnto the faithfull it is as yet freſh and preſent. For the remembrance of the death of Chriſt, which we make in the Supper, is farre more noble and holie, then theirs, whoe in ſome prophane banquet are mindfull of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, when they drinke the wine that he gaue them. For among theſe, he that is abſent worketh nothing: but in this holie ſupper of the faithfull the Lorde is preſent, and doth worke effectuallie by the ſpirit in the heartes of them, as he, whoe, according to his promiſes, is in the middeſt of them.</p>
                  <p>By theſe things it is moſt euident, that in the holie ſupper we doe not take awaie our Lorde Chriſt from his Church, nor denie that his bodie and bloode is there receiued to be our nouriſhment vnto life eternal: but we together with our predeceſſours, and the chiefe Prelates of our Religion, did, and as yet to this daie, doe denie, that the verie bodie of Chriſt is eaten carnallie, or that it is preſent euerie where corporallie, and after a naturall manner. For we doe open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie confes, according to the Scriptures, and with al the holy Fathers, that Ieſus Chriſt our Lord left this world, &amp; went to his Father: and that he now ſitteth at the right hande of his Father in heauenlie glorie, from whence he ſhall neuer deſcend, or be drawne downe into this earthlie and tranſito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie world. For the true preſence of Chriſt in the ſupper, is heauenlie, not earthlie, or carnall. Alſo we denie that the bread is turned into the bodie of Chriſt miraculouſly, ſo that the bread ſhould become the verybody of Chriſt naturallie, and ſubſtantially, yet after a ſpiritual manner. To conclude, we denie that the bodie of Chriſt is vnited with the ſignes, by anie other then a myſticall meane, whereof we haue ſpoken ſufficientlie in the generall conſideration of a ſacrament. Seeing therefore we haue expreſſelie ſaide and written with the holie Fathers, <hi>Tertullian, Hierome, Ambroſe,</hi> and <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> that <hi>the bread is a figure, token, and ſigne of the bodie of Chriſt;</hi> and alſo, <hi>that by bread and wine the bodie and blood of the Lord are ſignified,</hi> This is it which we would make manifeſt, to wit, that the bread is not the verie bodie of the Lord, but a token, or a ſacrament of his bodie. And yet we
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:8251:201"/>
doe not therefore ſpeake theſe thinges, as though we did ſimplie denie all kinde of the preſence of Chriſt in the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: for that kinde of preſence which now we haue confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, doth remaine true, without anie preiudice to theſe kinde of ſpeaches.

Therefore our Miniſters doe teach, that to theſe certaine wordes pronounced by Chriſt our Lorde, (wherein he doth peculiarlie pronounce, witnes, and inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute bread to be his bodie, and wine to be his bloode) I ſay, to theſe wordes no man maie adde any thing, no man may detract any thing from them: but euerie man in theſe words is to beleeue <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 1. obſeru. vpon this confeſſ.</note>that, which of them ſelues they ſignifie, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But it ſhall not be amiſſe now to ſhew, whence theſe abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes did ſpring at the firſt. There is an opinion ſpread abroad in the Church, that the Supper of the Lord is a worke, which being once done by the Prieſt, deſerueth remiſſion of ſinnes both of the fault, and of the puniſhment, not onelie for hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> they meane, that the Prieſt in the Maſſe doth offer a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for the quicke and the dead. And after this perſwaſion was once receiued, they taught men to ſeeke forgiuenes of ſinnes, and all good thinges, yea &amp; that the dead were f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eed from puniſhmentes, by the benefit of the Maſſe. And it made no matter, what kinde of men they were, that ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ed the Maſſes: for they taught that they were verie auaileable for others, without any good motion of the vſer. Afterwarde a queſtion aroſe, whether one Maſſe ſaid for many, was as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaileable, as ſeueral Maſſes for ſeueral perſons. And this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation did augment the number of Maſſes, and the gaine that came in by them, out of meaſure. But we diſpute not not now of the gaine, we onelie accuſe the impietie of them. For our Diuines doe prooue planlie, that this opinion, of the meriting &amp; applying of the Maſſe, is both falſe and impious. This is the ſtate of this controuerſie betweene vs and them.</p>
                  <p>And it is no hard matter for the godlie to iudge of this point, if a man wil but weigh the arguments that folow Firſt, we haue prooued before, that men doe obtaine remiſſion of ſinnes freelie by faith, that is, by ſure truſt to obtaine mercy for Chriſtes ſake. It is then impoſſible for a man to ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aine remiſſion of ſinnes for another mans work, and that without anie good motion, that is, without his owne faith. This reaſon doth very euidentlie ouerthrowe that monſtrous and impious opinion, touching the merit and application of the Maſſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Chriſtes paſſion was an oblation &amp; ſatisfaction not onelie for originall ſinne, but alſo for all other ſinnes, as it is written, in the epiſtle to the Hebr. <hi>We are ſanctified by the oblation of Chriſt once offered.</hi> Againe, <hi>By one oblation he hath made perfect for euer thoſe that are ſanctified.</hi> To conclude, a good part of the Epiſtle to the Heb. is ſpent in confirming this point, that the onelie ſacrifice of Chriſt did merit remiſſion of ſinnes, or reconciliation, for others. Therfore (ſaith he)
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:8251:209"/>
                     <hi>the Leuiticall ſacrifices were oft times offered in one manner, becauſe they could not take awaie ſinnes. But Chriſt by his ſacrifice hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> once ſatisfied for the ſinnes of all men.</hi> This honour of Chriſts ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice muſt not be transferred from him to the worke of a Prieſt. For he ſaith expreſſelie, that <hi>by one oblation the Saints are made perfect.</hi> Beſides, it is a wicked thing to place that truſt in the work of a prieſt, which ſhould onelie leane and ſtaie it ſelfe vpon the oblation and interceſſion of Chriſt the high Prieſt.</p>
                  <p>Thirdlie, Chriſt in the inſtitution of the Lordes ſupper, doth not commaund the Prieſtes to offer for others, either quick or dead: vpon what ground then or authoritie was this worſhip ordeined in the Church, as an offering for ſins, without anie commaundement of God? But that is yet more groſſe &amp; far from al reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that the maſſe ſhould be applied to deliuer the ſoules of ſuch as are dead. For the maſſe was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined for a remembrance, that is, that ſuch as receiued the ſupper of the Lord, ſhould ſtirre vp and confirme their faith, and comfort their diſtreſſed conſciences, with the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of Chriſtes benefits. Neither is the maſſe a ſatiſfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for the puniſhment, but it was inſtituted for the remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the fault, to wit, not that it ſhould be a ſatisfaction for the fault, but that it might be a ſacrament, by the vſe whereof, we might be put in minde of the benefit of Chriſt, and the forgiuenes of the fault. Seing therefore that the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of the Supper of the Lord for the deliuerance of the dead, is receiued without warrant of ſcripture, yea quite contrarie to ſcripture, it is to be condemned, as a new and vngodlie worſhip or ſeruice.</p>

                     <pb n="437" facs="tcp:8251:209"/>
Fiftlie, the applying of the benefit of Chriſt is by a mans owne faith, as Paull witneſſeth, Rom 3. <hi>Whome God hath ſet forth to be a reconciliation through faith in his blood,</hi> &amp; this apply<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing is made frelie: And therefore it is not made by another mans work, nor for another mans work. For when we vſe the ſacrament, this application is made by our owne work, &amp; by our owne faith, &amp; not by another mans work. For ſurely if we could haue no remiſſion, but by applying of maſſes, it ſhould be very vncertaine, and our faith &amp; truſt ſhould be transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from Chriſt vnto the work of a Prieſt, &amp; ſo is it come to paſſe, as all men ſee. Now faith placed in the work of a man is whollie condemned. Theſe arguments with ſundry other do witnes for vs, that the opinion of the merit, and applying of the maſſe for the quick and the dead, was for good cauſes miſliked and reprooued. Now if we would ſtand to conſider, how farre this error is ſpread in the Church, how the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of maſſes increaſed, and how through this ſacrifice, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenes both of the fault, and of the puniſhment, is promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the quick and the dead, it wil appeare that the Church is disfigured with ſhameful blots by this prophanation.

All Kings and Biſhops muſt with all their might endeuour, that this wholl mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter maie be rightlie laid forth, and the Church purged.</p>
                  <p>Sixtlie, the inſtitution of a ſacrament is contrarie to that abuſe. For there is not a word ſet downe of anie oblation for the ſinnes of the quick and the dead, but a commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to receiue the bodie and bloood of Chriſt: and, to doe it in the remembrance of the benefit of Chriſt. This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance doth ſignifie, not a bare repreſenting of the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie, as it were in a ſhew, as they dreame that are the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons of merit, by reaſon of the worke wrought, but it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth by faith to remember the promiſe &amp; benefit, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort the conſcience, and to render thankes for ſo great a bleſſing. For the principall cauſe of the inſtitution was, that our faith might then be ſtirred vp and exerciſed, when we doe receiue this pledge of Gods grace. Beſides, the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution

ordeineth, that there ſhould be a communication, that is, that the miniſters of the Church ſhould giue vntoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the bodie and blood of the Lord. And this order was obſerued in the primitiue Church. Saint Paull is witnes to the Corinths: when as he commaundeth, <hi>That one ſhould ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> our Churches. And there is one common Maſſe appointed according to the inſtitution of Chriſt, wherein the Paſtors of the Churches <note n="*" place="margin">looke the 4. obſeru.</note>do conſecrate themſelues, and giue vnto others, the ſacrament of the bodie and blood of Chriſt: and this kinde of maſſe is vſed euerie <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 5 obſeru.</note>holie daie, and other daies alſo, if anie be deſirous to vſe the ſacrament. Yet none are admitted to the communion, except they be firſt tried, and examined. We adioyne moreouer godlie ſermons, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as Chriſt commaunded, that there ſhould be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, when this ceremonie is vſed. And in ſuch ſermons, men are both taught diligentlie in other articles and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the Goſpel, and alſo put in minde, for what vſe the ſacrament was inſtituted, to weet, not that this ceremonie could merit for them remiſſion of ſinnes, by the work done, but that the ſacrament is a teſtimonie and a pledge whereby Chriſt witneſſeth vnto vs, that he performeth his promiſes. And in our ſermons as men are taught diligently concerning other articles and precepts of the goſpell, ſo are they alſo put in minde, for what vſe the ſacraments were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, to weete, not that the ceremonie ſhould merit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſinnes by the bare work wrought: but that the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament ſhould be a teſtimonie and a pledge, wherby Chriſt doth teſtifie, that he performeth his promiſe, and that his promiſes pertaine vnto vs, that Chriſt giueth vs his bodie, to teſtifie that he is effectuall in vs, as in his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and his blood, for a witnes vnto vs, that we are waſhed with his blood. The ſacrament therefore doth profit them, that do repent, and ſeeke comfort therein, and being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by that teſtimonie, do beleue that remiſſion of ſinnes
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:8251:210"/>
is giuen them indeede, and are thankfull vnto Chriſt for ſo great a benefit. And ſo the application of the benefit of Chriſt is not by an other mans work, but by euery mans own faith, and his owne vſe of the ſacrament. For when we in in our owne perſons vſe the Sacrament, Chriſtes inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it doth belong vnto vs. This kinde of vſe of the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is holie, and to be taught in the Churches, which doth giue light vnto the doctrine of faith, and of the ſpirituall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes, and true worſhip, and bringeth vnto the conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the godlie verie great comfort and ſtrength of faith, Before theſe daies the Church hath beene farre otherwiſe taught, touching the vſe of the ſacrament, there was no word of anie thing, but that this work was to be done. But no man ſpake anie thing of faith, or the comfort of conſciences. And mens conſciences were racked with ouer great care &amp; paines of confeſſing themſelues. This they tooke to be the puritie which the goſpell requireth, whereas the goſpell doth require true feare, true faith, and truſt, comforteth vs by the vſe of this ſacrament, that they which do truelie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent maie aſſuredlie beleeue, that God is become merciful vnto them by Chriſt, though that our nature be fraile and vncleane, and though that this our imperfect obedience be farre from the perfection of the law.</p>
                  <p>By all this that hath bene ſaid, it is cleare that the maſſe that is in vſe amongſt vs, doth a gree with the inſtitution of Chriſt, and the manner of the primitiue Church. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides it doth notably lay open the true vſe of the ſacrament, Such a common work was there in the Church of old time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as Chryſoſtome doth witnes, who ſaith, <hi>that the Prieſt did ſtand at the aultar, &amp; cal ſome vnto the communion, &amp; put back o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi> And by the decrees of the Nicen Synode it is euident, that ſome one did celebrate the Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>urgie, as the Grecians cal it, and did miniſter the bodie and blood of the Lord to allthe reſt. For theſe are the words of the decree. <hi>Let the Deacons in their order after the Prieſtes receiue the holy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of a Biſhop, or of a Prieſt.</hi> Here he doth expreſſelie ſay, that the Prieſtes did receiue the ſacrament of ſome one, that miniſtred it. And before Gregories time there is no mention of anie priuate Maſſe. But as oft as the olde wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſpeake of a Maſſe, it is euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that they ſpeak of a Maſſe,
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:8251:211"/>
that was common. Seeing therefore that the rite and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the maſſe vſed with vs hath authority out of ſcripture, example from the olde Church, and that we haue onelie reiected certaine intollerable abuſes, we hope that the vſe of our Churches cannot be miſliked.

Yea &amp; almoſt all the ceremonies that are in vſe, ſauing that, with the ſonges in Latine we mingle certein Pſalmes in Dutch here and there, which he added for the peoples inſtruction. For therfore we haue need of ceremonies, that the may teach the vnlearned, &amp; that the Preaching of Gods word maie ſtirre vp ſome vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the true feare, truſt, and inuocation of God. This is not only, commaunded by S. Paull, to vſe a tongue that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple vnderſtand, but mans law hath alſo appointed it. We vſe the people to receiue the ſacrament together, if ſo be any be ſound fit thereunto. And that is a thing that doth increaſe the reuerence and due eſtimation of the publike ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. For none are admitted, except they be firſt prooued, and tried. Beſides we vſe to put men in minde of the worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and vſe of a ſacrament, how great comforte it bringeth to fearefull conſciences, that they may learne to beleeue God, and to looke for and craue al good things at his hands. This worſhip doth pleaſe God, ſuch an vſe of the Sacrament doth nouriſh pietie towardes God. Therfore it ſeemeth not
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:8251:211"/>
that Maſſes be more religiouſlie celebrated among our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries, then with vs. But it is euident, that of long time this hath bin the publike, &amp; moſt greeuous complaint of al good men, that Maſſes are filthilie prophaned, beeing vſed for gaine. And it is not vnknowen, how farre this abuſe hath ſpread it ſelfe in all Churches, of what manner of men Maſſes are vſed, onelie for a reward, or for wages, and how many doe vſe them, againſt the prohibition of the Canons. Aud Paull doth greeuouſlie threaten thoſe, which handle the Lords Supper vnworthelie, ſaying, <hi>He that ſhall eate this bread, or drinke the cuppe of the Lord vnworthelie, ſhall be guiltie of the bodie and bloode of the Lord.</hi> Therfore, when we admoniſhed the Prieſtes of this ſinne, priuate Maſſes were laide aſide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong vs, ſeeing that for the moſt part, there were no priuate Maſſes, but onelie for lucres ſake. Neither were the Biſhops ignorant of theſe abuſes, who if they had amended them in time, there had now beene leſſe diſſenſion. Heretofore, by their diſſembling, they ſuffered much corruption to creepe into the Church: now they begin, though it be late, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of the calamities of the Church, ſeeing that this hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie burlie was raiſed vp by no other meane, then by thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes, which were ſo euident, that they could no longer be tolerated. There were many diſſentions, concerning the Maſſe, and as touching the Sacrament. And peraduenture the world is puniſhed, for ſo long a prophaning of Maſſes, which they, who both could, and ought to haue amended it, haue ſo many yeares tolerated in their Churches. For in the ten commaundements it is written, <hi>He that abuſeth the name of the Lord, ſhall not eſcape vnpuniſhed.</hi> And from the beginning of the worlde, there neither was, nor is any diuine thing, which might ſeeme ſo to be imployed to gaine, as is the Maſſe.</p>
                  <p>There was added an opinion, which did increaſe priuate Maſſes infinitelie, to wit, that Chriſt by his paſſion did ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie for Originall ſinne, and appointed Maſſe, wherein an oblation ſhould be made for dailie ſinnes, both mortall, and veniall. Hereupon a common opinion was receiued, that Maſſe is a worke, that taketh awaie the ſinnes of the quicke and the dead, and that for the doeing of the worke. Here m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n beganne to diſpute, whether one Maſſe ſaide for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:8251:212"/>
were of as great force, as particular Maſſes ſaide for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular men. This diſputation hath brought forth an in finite multitude of maſſes. Concerning theſe opinions our preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers haue admoniſhed vs, that they do diſagree from the holie Scriptures, and hurt the glorie of the paſſion of Chriſt. For the paſſion of Chriſt was an oblation and ſatisfaction, not onelie for Originall ſinne, but alſo for all other ſinnes, as it is written in the Epiſtle to the Hebrewes: <hi>We are ſanctified by the oblation of Ieſus Chriſt once made.</hi> Alſo, <hi>By one oblation he hath made perfit for euer thoſe that are ſanctified.</hi> Alſo the Scripture teacheth, that we are iuſtified before God through faith in Chriſt, when we beleeue that our ſinnes are forgiuen for Chriſt his ſake. Now, if the Maſſe doe take awaie the ſinnes of the quicke and the deade, euen for the workes ſake that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> done, then iuſtification commeth by the worke of Maſſes, and not by faith, which the Scripture can not aware withall. But Chriſt commaundeth vs <hi>to doe it in remembrance of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe:</hi> therefore the Maſſe is inſtituted, that faith, in them which vſe the Sacrament, may remember what benefites it receiueth by Chriſt, and that it may raiſe vp, and comforte a fearefull conſcience. For this is to remember Chriſt, to wit, to remember his benefites, and to feele and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, that they be in deede exhibited vnto vs. Neither is it ſufficient to call to minde the hiſtorie, becauſe that the Iewes alſo, and the wicked can doe that. Therefore the Maſſe muſte be vſed to this ende, that there the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may be reached vnto them, that haue neede of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte, as Ambroſe ſaith, <hi>Becauſe I doe alwaies ſinne, therefore</hi> I <hi>ought alwaies to receiue a medicine.</hi> And ſeeing that the Maſſe is ſuch a communion of the Sacrament, we doe obſerue one common Maſſe euery holidaie, and on other daies, if any wil vſe the Sacrament, when it is offered to them, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired it. Neither is this cuſtome newlie brought into the Church. For the auncient Fathers before Gregories time make no mention of any priuat Maſſe: of the common Maſſe they ſpeake much. Chryſoſtome ſaitth, <hi>That the Prieſt did dailie ſtand at the aultar, and call ſome vnto the Communion, and put backe others.</hi> And by the auncient Canons it is euident, that ſome one did celebrate the Maſſe, of whome other Prieſts and Deacons did receiue the bodie of the Lord. For
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:8251:212"/>
ſo the words of the Nicen canon do ſounde: <hi>Let the deacons in their order after the Prieſts receiue the holy communion of a Biſhop, or of a prieſt.</hi> And Paul concerning the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, <hi>that one tarie for another,</hi> that ſo there maie be a common participation. Seeing therefore that among vs the Maſſe hath the example of the Church out of the Scripture, and the Fathers, we hope that it cannot be diſliked, eſpeciallie for that our publike ceremonies are kept of vs for the moſte parte alike vnto the vſual ceremonies: onelie the number of Maſſes is not alike, the which, by reaſon of verie great and manifeſt abuſes, it were certainelie farre <hi>better to be moderated. For in times paſt</hi> alſo in the Churches, <hi>whreunto was greateſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort, it was not the vſe to haue maſſe ſaide euerie daie,</hi> as the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partite hiſtorie. <hi>lib.</hi> 9. <hi>cap.</hi> 38. doth witnes. <hi>Againe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in Alexandria euery fourth and ſixth day of the weeke the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are read, and the Doctours do interpret them, and all other things are done alſo, except onelie the ſolemne manner of oblaion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Here we will not diſpute, what men are to think, concerning a receiued cuſtom, contrarie to the authoritie of the Apoſtolique Scripture, contrarie to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, and contrary to the example of the Primitiue Church.

In the ende they doe againe giue thankes. All men, which are not altogether ignorant of antiquitie, doe know that this rite, and this Communion, doth for the moſt part agree with the writinges of the Apoſtles, and with the cuſtome of the auncient Church, euen almoſte to Gregories time: which thing being ſo, the cuſtome of our Churches is to be approoued, not to be diſalowed: but our Aduerſaries miſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king our cuſtome, doe defend manie errours, ſome more foule and groſſe, others coloured with new deceites.</p>
                  <p>Manie heretofore haue written, that in the maſſe there is an oblation made for the quick and the dead, and that it doth deſerue remiſſion of ſinnes, both for him that maketh it, and for others, euen for the workes ſake. And thus were moſt of them perſuaded, and as yet are like vnto the Phariſies, and the heathen. For after the ſame manner the Phariſies and the Heathen did dreame, that they for the workes ſake, did deſerue, for them ſelues, and for others, remiſſion of ſinnes, peace, and manie other good thinges Or although thoſe, which were not ſo blinde, did ſpeake more modeſtlie, and ſaide, that they did deſerue, but not without the good intention of the ſacrificer, yet they imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that thoſe ſacrifices were merits, &amp; a raunſome. By rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this opinion there were a multitude of ſacrifices, and the craftie meanes of gaine were increaſed. Such is the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe of Maſſes, and the prophanation of the Lordes Supper, almoſt throughout the wholl world.

                  </p>
                  <p>That this is an vnchangeable and eternal truth, it is moſt manifeſt. And whereas certaine fragments, which they call the Canons of the maſſe, are alledged againſt this ſo cleare light of the trueth, it is alſo manifeſt that the Greeke and Latine Canons are verie vnlike the one to the other, and that the Greeke Canons do diſagree among themſelues in a moſt waightie matter: and it appeareth that in the Latine Canon manie iagges &amp; peeces were by litle &amp; litle patch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together of ignorant authors. The auncient Church doth vſe the names of <hi>Sacrifice and oblation:</hi> but therby it vnderſtandeth the whole action, prayers, a taking of it, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, faith, a confeſſion, and thankſegiuing. This wholl inward and outward action, in euerie one that is tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to God, and in the wholl Church, is indeede a ſacrifice of praiſe, or thankeſgiuing and a reaſonable ſeruice. And when the Lord ſaith, Ioh. 4. <hi>The true worſhippers ſhall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the lord in ſpirit and in trueth,</hi> he affirmeth that in the new teſtament outward ſacrifices are not commaunded, which of neceſſitie ſhould be made, although there were no motions of the holie ghoſt in the heart, as in the law it was neceſſarie, that the ceremonie of the Paſſe ouer ſhould be kept. But touching the ſupper of the Lord it is ſaid, 1. Cor. 11, <hi>Let euerie man examine him-ſelfe, &amp;c.</hi> So the ſupper of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Furthermore, concerning the dead, it is manifeſt, that all this ſhew is repugnant to the wordes of the inſtitution of the Supper, wherein it is ſaid, <hi>Take ye, eat ye, &amp;c. Doe ye this in remembrance of me.</hi> What doth this apperteine to the dead, or to thoſe that be abſent? and yet in a great part of Europe manie maſſes are ſaid for the dead: alſo a great number not knowing what they do, do read Maſſes for a reward. But ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that all theſe things are manifeſtlie wicked, to wit, to offer, as they ſpeake, to the end that they maie deſerue for the quick and the dead: or for a man to do he knoweth not what, they do horriblie ſinne, that retaine and defend theſe miſchieuous deeds. And ſeeing that this ceremony is not to be taken for a ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, without the vſe wherunto it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined, what manner of Idolworſhip is there vſed, let god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and learned men conſider. Alſo it is a manifeſt propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, to carie about parte of the Supper of the Lord, and to worſhip it: where a parte is vtterlie transferred to an vſe cleane contrarie to the firſt Inſtitution, whereas the text ſaith, <hi>Take, eat:</hi> and this ſhew is but a thing deuiſed of late. To conclude, what be the manners of manie Prieſtes and Monks in all Europe, which haue no regard of this ſaying, 1. Cor. 11, <hi>Let euerie man examine him-ſelfe?</hi> Alſo, <hi>Whoſoeuer taketh it vnworthelie, ſhall be guiltie of the bodie and bloode of the Lord.</hi> Euerie man of him-ſelfe doth know theſe things.</p>
                  <p>Now, although the chiefe Biſhopes and hypocrites, who ſeeke deluſions to eſtabliſh theſe euills, doe ſcoffe at theſe complaintes, yet it is moſt certaine, that God is greeuouſlie offended with theſe wicked deeds, as he was angrie with the people of Iſraell for their prophanations of the ſacrifices. And we do ſee euident examples of wrath, to wit, the ruines of ſo many kingdomes, the ſpoile and waſte that the Turkes doe make in the worlde, the confuſions of opinions, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny moſte lamentable diſſipations of Churches. But <hi>O Sonne of God, Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, which waſt crucified and raiſed vp againe for vs, thou which art the high prieſt of the Church, with true ſighes we beſeech the, that for thine, and thy eternall Fathers glorie, thou wouldeſt take awaie Idolls, errours, and abominations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and,</hi>

The greatnes of our ſinnes, which the prophanation of the Supper of the Lorde theſe many yeares hath brought forth, doth ſurpaſſe the eloquence of Angells and men.</hi> We are herein the ſhorter, ſeeing that no words can be deuiſed ſufficient, to ſet out the greatnes of this thing, and in this great griefe we beſeech the Sonne of God, that he would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend theſe euills, and alſo for a further declaration, we offer our ſelfes to them, that wil heare it. But in this queſtion we ſee that to be chieflie done, which Salomon ſaith, <hi>He that ſingeth ſonges to a wicked heart, is like him that powreth vineger vpon nitre.</hi>

                  <p>Our aduerſaries know, that theſe perſwaſions of their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, are the ſinewes of their power and riches: therefore they will heare nothing that is ſaid againſt it.

And, the Sonne of God himſelfe did offer vp himſelfe, going into the holie of holies, that is, into the ſecret counſell of the Diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, ſeeing the will of the eternall Father, and bearing his great wrath, and vnderſtanding the cauſes of this wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full counſell: theſe weightie things are meant, when the text ſaith, Heb. 9. <hi>He offered himſelfe.</hi> And when Eſaie ſaith, Cap. 53. <hi>He will make his ſoule an offering for ſinne.</hi> Now therefore what doe the Prieſtes meane, who ſaie, that they offer vp Chriſt? and yet antiquitie neuer ſpake after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.

For when Chriſt did inſtitute this Sacrament, he did not eat thereof alone, but he did diſpenſe it to his Church, which then was preſent with him, ſaying, <hi>Take ye, eate ye, &amp;c.</hi> And, <hi>Drinke ye all of this, &amp;c.</hi> This inſtitution of Chriſt the auncient and true Catholique Church did ſo ſeuerelie obſerue, that it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated them, which being preſent whileſt this holy Sacrament was adminiſtred, would not communicate with others. <hi>Anacl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="457" facs="tcp:8251:219"/>
publique communion of the Lords Supper maie be reſtored.</p>
               <p>Another errour is this, that the Euchariſt is ſuch a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, as ought to be offered daielie in the Church, for the purging of the ſinnes of the quicke and the dead, and for the obtaining of other benefites, both corporall and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual. This error is euidently contrary to the Goſpel of Chriſt, which witneſſeth, <hi>That Chriſt, by one oblation, once onelie made, hath made perfect for euer thoſe that be ſanctified.</hi> And, becauſe that Chriſt by his paſſion and death, hath purchaſed remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſinnes for vs, which alſo is declared vnto vs by the Goſpell in the new Teſtament, therefore it is not lawfull to ſacrifice anie more for ſinne: for the Epiſtle to the Hebrews ſaith, <hi>Where there is remiſſion of ſinnes, there is no further oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for ſinne.</hi> For whereas Chriſt ſaieth, <hi>Doe this in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of me,</hi> he doth not commaund to offer his bodie and and bloode in the Supper vnto God, but to the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the Church, by eating the bodie, and drinking the bloode of Chriſt, and by ſhewing forth the benefit of his death, may be admoniſhed of that oblation of the bodie and bloode of Chriſt, which was made once onelie on the Croſſe for the purging of our ſinnes. For ſo Paull doeth interpret this ſaying of Chriſt, ſaying, <hi>So often as ye ſhall eate</hi> (he doth not ſaie, offer) <hi>this breade, and drinke this cuppe, ſhew ye forth the death of the Lord, till he come.</hi> And truelie we confeſſe, that the auncient Eccleſiaſticall writers did call the Euchariſt, <hi>a ſacrifice, &amp; an oblation:</hi> but they expounde themſelues, that by the name of Sacrifice they meane a remembrance, a ſhewing forth or a preaching of that Sacrifice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which Chriſt did once offer vpon the Croſſe: as alſo they call the memoriall of the Paſſeouer, and of Pentecoſt, the Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The third error is this, that manie do thinke, that the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation (as they cal it) of the Euchariſt, is not of it ſelfe a propi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tiation for ſinnes, but that it doth apply the propitiation and merit of Chriſt to the quick, and the dead. But we haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie ſhewed, that the Euchariſt properlie is not an oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but is ſo called, becauſe it is a remembrance of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, which was once made on the croſſe. Moreouer, the application of the merit of Chriſt, is not made by anie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther outward inſtrument, then by the preaching of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:8251:220"/>
of Chriſt, and by diſpenſing thoſe ſacraments, which Chriſt hath inſtituted for this vſe: &amp; the merit of Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing offered, &amp; applied, is not receiued but by faith. Marc. 16. <hi>Preach the Goſpel to euery creature.</hi> For by the miniſterie of the Goſpell the benefits of Chriſt be offered, &amp; applied to crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that is, either to the Iewes, or to the Gentiles. And it followeth, <hi>He that ſhall beleeue, and be baptized, he ſhall be ſaued:</hi> becauſe that by the receiuing of the ſacraments, and by faith, the benefits offered, and applied, be receiued Rom. 1. <hi>The goſpell is the power of God to ſaluation, to euerie <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Now in the priuate Maſſe, bread and wine are ſo handled, that the Prieſt doth neither publiquely declare the Goſpel of Chriſt, but doth ſoftlie mumble vp to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>ſelfe certaine words, and eſpecialie the wordes of the Supper, or of conſecration<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>TRue it is, that a man maie lawfullie praie priuatelie in anie tongue that he doth vnderſtand: but publique praiers ought in the holie aſſemblies to be made in the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gare tongue, or ſuch a language as is knowne to all. Let all the prayers of the faithful be powred forth to God alone through the mediation of Chriſt only, out of a true faith &amp; pure loue. As for inuocation of Saints, or vſing them as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſors, to intreat for vs, the prieſthod of our Lord Chriſt &amp; true religion wil not permitte vs. Prayer muſt be made for Magiſtracie, for Kings and all that are placed in authoritie,
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:8251:224"/>
for Miniſters of the Church, and for all neceſſities of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in anie calamitie, and ſpeciallie in the calamitie of the Church, prayer muſt be made both priuatellie, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquelie, without ceaſing. Moreouer wee muſt praie wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linglie, and not by conſtraint, nor for anie reward: neither muſt we ſuperſtitiouſlie tie prayer to anie place, as though it were not lawfull to praie but in the Church.

Socrates in his hyſtorie ſaith, <hi>In anie countrie or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereſoeuer, you ſhall not finde two Churches which doe whollie agree in prayer:</hi> The authors of this difference I thinke were thoſe which had the gouernment of the Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Beſides this, there muſt be a meane and meaſure, as in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie other thing, ſo alſo in publique prayers, that they be not ouerlong, and tedious: let therefore the moſt time be giuen to teaching of the goſpell, in ſuch holie aſſemblies: and let there be diligent heede taken, that the people in the aſſemblies be not wearied with ouerlong praiers, ſo as when the preaching of the goſpell ſhould be heard, they through weariſomnes either deſire to go <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Yea and the Preachers ought to keepe a meane. Likewiſe the ſinging in ſacred aſſemblies ought to be moderated, where it is in vſe. That long, which they cal Gregories ſong, hath manie groſſe thinges in it. Wherefore it is vpon good cauſe reiected of ours, and of all other reformed Churches. If there be any Churches which haue faithful praier in good manner, and no ſinging at all, they are not therefore to be condemned for all Churches haue not the commoditie and opportunitie of ſinging. And certaine it is by teſtimonies of antiquitie, that as the cuſtome of ſinging hath bene verie auncient in the Eaſt Churches, ſo it was long or it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in the Weſt Churches.</p>
                  <p>In Auncient time there were <hi>Canonicall houres,</hi> that is, knowne prayers framed for certeine houres in the daie, and chaunted therein, oft repeated, as the Papiſts manner is:

which maie be prooued by manie of their leſſons appointed in their houres and diuers other arguments. Moreouer they haue manie abſurde things (that I ſaie no more) and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are well omitted of our Churches, that haue brought in their ſtead matters more wholſome for the whol Church of God.</p>

                  <p>THe Church of Chriſt hath riches through the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifulnes of princes, and the liberalitie of the faithful, who haue giuen their goods to the Church: for the Church hath need of ſuch goods: and hath had goods from aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient time, for the manteinance of thinges neceſſarie for the Church.

               <p>This Catechiſme, which doth conteine in it the ful &amp; Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike doctrine of Chriſtianiſme, &amp; the knowledge of moſt weighty things ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of before, our preachers do vſe in ſtead of a ſure rule, method, &amp; table of al thoſe things which they teach, &amp; of all their ſermons &amp; writings: &amp; this they do faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully care for, and beſtowe all their labour therein, that this wholl ordinarie doctrine of the principles of true faith, and Chriſtian godlines, and the doctrine of the foundation, may be imprinted in the bottome of the heartes of Chriſtians, &amp; throughlie ingrafted in the mindes and life of the hearers, and that after this manner.

               <p>Secondlie, they muſt well learne and beare in minde, and be able readilie to rehearſe, &amp; to beleeue from the heart, to keepe, and to profeſſe with the mouth, the chiefe points of the Catholike, Chriſtian, and Apoſtolike Creed, and to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie a chriſtian pietie by actions, or manners, &amp; a life which maie beſeeme it.

                  <p>BY praier god is inuocated, and true inuocation is a work of faith, and can not be done without faith. Now faith doth behold Chriſt, and relie vpon his merites onelie. Wherefore, except thou ſhalt applie vnto thy ſelfe the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt by faith, praier wil ſtand thee in no ſtead before God. Now praier is neceſſarilie required for this purpoſe, that by a due conſideration of the promiſes of God, faith may be ſtirred vp &amp; kindled in vs. Therfore it is not abſurdly ſaide, that <hi>ſinnes are cleane taken away by praier:</hi> yet muſt it not ſo be vnderſtoode, as though the verie worke of praier, of it owne merit, were a ſatisfaction for ſinnes befor God; but that by praier faith is ſtirred vp and kindled in vs, by which faith we are made partakers of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="475" facs="tcp:8251:228"/>
to haue the merit of Chriſt applied to vs, and receiued by faith. Therefore it can not be, that praier ſhould be ſuch a worke, as that for the merit thereof we might obteine remiſſion of our ſinnes before God. Pſalme. 108. <hi>Lette his praier be turned into ſinne.</hi> But it is not poſſible that praier ſhould be turned into ſinne, if of it ſelfe it were ſo worthie a worke, as that ſinne thereby ſhould be purged.

                  <p>WE doe diligentlie commend almes, and exhort the Church, that euerie man helpe his neighbour, by euerie duetie that he may, and teſtifie his loue. But where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is ſaide in a certaine place, <hi>That almes doe take away ſinne, as water doth quench fire,</hi> we muſt vnderſtand it according to the analogy of faith. Eor what neede was there, to the taking away of our ſinnes, of Chriſt his paſſion and death, if ſinnes might be taken awaie by the merit of almes? And what vſe were there of the miniſterie of the Goſpell, if almes were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of God for an inſtrument, whereby the death of Chriſt might be applied to vs? Therefore, that Chriſt his honour may not be violated, and the miniſterie of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell may reteine it lawfull vſe, we teach, that almes doth
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:8251:229"/>
thus take away ſinne, not that of it ſelfe it is a worthie worke, whereby ſinne may either be purged, or the merit of Chriſt applied, but that it is a worke and fruite of charitie toward our neighbour, by which worke we doe teſtifie our faith and obedience, which we owe vnto God Now where faith is, there Chriſt alone is acknowledged to be the purger of ſins. Therfore, ſeing that almes doth teſtifie, after their manner, that Chriſt doth dwell in the Godlie, it doth alſo teſtifie that they haue remiſſion of ſinnes. For except almes be a worke of charitie, which may beare witnes to faith in Chriſt, it is ſo farre from ſignifying, that man hath remiſſion of ſins through Chriſt, that it doth euen ſtinke in the ſight of God, <hi>If I ſhall diſtribute</hi> (ſaith Paull) <hi>all my ſubſtance, that it may be meate for the poore, and ſhall not haue loue, it profiteth me nothing.</hi> Therfore we teach, that good workes muſt be done neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilie, that God is to be inuocated, and that almes is to be giuen, that we may teſtifie our faith and loue, and obeie the calling of God. But in true repentance, we teach, that we obteine remiſſion of ſinnes, onelie for the Sonne of God our Lord Ieſus Chriſt his ſake, through faith, according to that which Peter ſaith, <hi>To him doe all the Prophets beare witnes, that through his name, euerie one that beleeueth in him doth receiue remiſſion of ſinnes.</hi>

For it is too too manifeſt that theſe haue degenerated from the firſt appointment &amp; vſe of the Fathers. For no man, which vnderſtandeth the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the auncient Fathers, is ignorant of this, that it was a cuſtome among them, wiſely to rehearſe, alſo to expound a few Pſalmes with ſome Chapter of the ſcripture, whereas now adaies many Pſalmes are chaunted, for the moſt parte without vnderſtanding, and of the reading of the Scripture, there be onelie the beginnings of Chapters left vnto vs, and innumerable things are taken vp one after an other, which ſerue rather for ſuperſtition, then for godlines. Therefore our miniſters did firſt of all deteſt this, that many things, which were contrarie to the Scriptures, are mingled with holie praiers and ſongs: as that thoſe things are attributed to Saints, which are proper to Chriſt alone; namelie to free vs from ſinne, and other diſcommodities, and not ſo much to obteine, as to giue vs the fauour of God, and all kinde of good things. Secondlie, becauſe they are increaſed ſo infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely, that they cannot be ſung, or rehearſed with an atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue minde.

Euery Church therfore doth chooſe vnto it ſelfe a certaine time, for publique praiers, and for preaching of the Goſpell, and for the celebration of the Sacramentes: and it is not lawfull for euerie one to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe this apointment of the Church at his owne plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. For except ſome due time &amp; leaſure were alotted to the outward exerciſe of religion, out of doubt men would be quite drawne from it by their own affaires. In regard hereof we ſee that in the auncient Churches, there were not onelie certaine ſet howers in the weeke appointed for meetinges, but that alſo euen the Lordes daie, euer ſince the Apoſtles time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was conſecrated to the religious exerciſes, and
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:8251:231"/>
vnto a holie reſt, which alſo is now verie well obſerued of our Churches, for the worſhippe of God, and increaſe of charitie. Yet herein we giue no place vnto the Iewiſh obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of the daie, or to anie ſuperſtitions. For we doe not account one day to be holier then an other, nor thinke that reſting of it ſelfe is liked of God. Beſides we do celebrate and keepe the Lords daie, and not the Saboth, and that with a free obſeruation.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer, if the Churches doe religiouſlie celebrate the memorie of the Lordes natiuitie, curcumciſion, paſſion and reſurrection, and of his aſcenſion into heauen, and ſending the holie ghoſt vpon his diſciples, according to chriſtian libertie, we doe verie well allow of it. But as for feſtiual daies ordeined to men, or the ſaintes departed, we cannot alow of them. For indeede ſuch feaſtes, muſt be referred to the firſt table of the lawe, and be long peculiarlie vnto God. To conclude, theſe feſtiuall daies which are appointed to ſaints, and abrogated of vs, haue in them many groſſe things, vnprofitable, and not to be tolerated. In the meanetime we confeſſe, that the remembrance of ſaintes, in due time and place, may be to good vſe and profit commended vnto the people in ſermons, and the holie examples of holie men ſet before their eies, to be imitated of all.</p>
                  <p>Now, the more ſharpelie that the Church of Chriſt doeth accuſe ſurfeting, drunkennes, al kinde of Iuſtes andintempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rancie, ſo much the more earneſtlie it doth commend vnto vs Chriſtian faſting. For faſting is nothing els but an abſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and temperancie of the godlie, and a watching and chaſtiſing of our fleſh, taken vp for the preſent neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie, whereby we are humbled before God, and withdrawe from the fleſh thoſe thinges, whereby it is cheriſhed, to the e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Wherefore they doe not faſt at all, that haue no regarde of thoſe thinges, but doe imagine that they faſte, if they ſtuffe their bellies on a daie, and for a ſet or preſcribed time doe abſtaine from certaine meates, thinking that by this verie worke wrought they ſhall pleaſe God, and doe a good work. Faſting is a helpe of the praiers of the ſaintes, and of all vertues. But the faſtes, wherein the Iewes faſted from meate, and not from wickednes, pleaſed God nothing at all,
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:8251:231"/>
as we maie ſee in the booke of the Prophetes.</p>
                  <p>Now faſting is either publike or priuate. In olde time they celebrated publike faſtes in troubleſome times, and in the affliction of the Church. Wherin they abſtained altogether from meate vnto the euening, and beſtowed all that time in holy praiers, the worſhippe of God, and repentance. Theſe differed litle from mourninges, and lamentations, and of theſe there is often mention made in the Prophetes, and eſpeciallie in the ſecond chapter of Ioell. Such a faſt ſhould be kept at this daie, when the Church is in diſtreſſe. Priuate faſtes are vſed of euerie one of vs, according as euery one fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the ſpirit weakned in him. For ſo far forth he withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that which might cheriſh and ſtrengthen the fleſh. All faſtes ought to proceed from a free &amp; willing ſpirit, and ſuch a one as is truly humbled, &amp; not framed to win applauſe and liking of men, much leſſe to the end that a man might merit righteouſnes by them. But let euerie one faſt to this ende, that he maie depriue the fleſh of that which would cheriſh it, and that he maie the more zealouſlie ſerue God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The faſt of Lent hath teſtimony of antiquity, but none out of the Apoſtles writings: and therfore ought not nor cannot be impoſed on the faithfull. It is certaine that in olde time there were diuers manners and vſes of this faſt, whereupon Ireneus, a moſt auncient writer, ſaieth,</hi> Some think that this faſt ſhould be obſerued one daie onelie, others two daies, but others, more, and ſome fourtie daies. Which varietie of keeping this faſt began not now in our times, but long before vs, by thoſe, as I ſuppoſe, which not ſimplie holding that, which was deliuered them from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, fell ſhortly after into another cuſtome, either through negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, or ignorance. <hi>Moreouer, Socrates, the writer of the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, ſaieth,</hi> Becauſe no auncient record is founde, concerning this matter, I thinke the Apoſtles left this to euerie mans owne iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that euery one might worke that which is good, without feare, or conſtraint.</p>
                  <p>Now as concerning the choiſe of meates, we ſuppoſe that in faſting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all that ſhould be taken from the fleſh, whereby it is made more luſtie and vntamed and wherin it doth moſt immoderately delight, wherby the fleſh is moſt of al pampe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, whether they be fiſh, ſpices, dainties, or excellent wines.

Againe, we condemne thoſe which are too much and prepoſterouſlie officious to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde the deade, whoe like Ethnikes doe greatlie la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and bewaile their dead (we do not diſcommend that moderate mourning, which the Apoſtle doth allow, 1. Theſſ. 4. but iudge it an vnnaturall thing, to be touched with no ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row) &amp; do ſacrifice for the dead, &amp; mumble certein praiers, not without their pennie for their paines, thinking by theſe their dueties, to deliuer theſe their friendes from torments, wherein they being wrapped by death, they ſuppoſe they maie be ridde out of them againe by ſuch lamentable ſongs. For we beleeue, that the faithfull, after the bodilie death, do go directlie vnto Chriſt, and therefore do not ſtand in neede of the helpe or praiers for the dead, or any other ſuch duty of them which are aliue. In like manner we beleue, that the vnbeleeuers be caſt headlong directlie into hell, from whence there is no returne opened to the wicked, by any du<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ties of thoſe which liue.</p>
                  <p>But as concerning that which ſome teach concerning the fire of Purgatorie, it is flat contrarie to the Chriſtian faith, <hi>(I beleeue the remiſſion of ſinnes, and life euerlaſting)</hi> and to the abſolute purgation of ſinnes made by Chriſt: and to theſe ſayings of Chriſt our Lord: <hi>Verilie, verilie I ſaie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>

<pb n="489" facs="tcp:8251:235"/>
traditions out of meaſure. Of this there hath beene complaint made in the Church not onelie by late writers, as Gerſon, and others, but alſo by Saint Auguſtine. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is needfull to admoniſh the people, what to thinke of the traditions which are brought into the Church by mans authoritie. For it is not without cauſe, that Chriſte and Paull doe ſo often ſpeake of traditions, and admoniſh the Church to iudge wiſelie of traditions. There was a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon opinion, not of the common ſort alone, but alſo of the teachers in the Church, that the difference of meates and ſuch like workes, which the Eccleſiaſticall traditions doe commaund, are ſeruices of God, which deſerue remiſſion of ſins: Alſo that ſuch kindes of worſhip, are Chriſtian righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes, and as neceſſarie, as the Leuiticall ceremonies in the olde Teſtament euer were; and that they cannot be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted without ſinne, no not then, when they might be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted without daunger of giuing offence. Theſe perſuaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons haue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> brought forth many diſcommodities. Firſt the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpell is hereby obſcured, which teacheth, that ſinnes are forgiuen freely by Chriſt. This benefit of Chriſt is transferred vnto the worke of man. And by reaſon of this opinion, traditions were eſpeciallie encreaſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that theſe workes were ſuppoſed to deſerue remiſſion of ſinnes, to be ſatisfactions, and to be Chriſtian righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. Moreouer, for this cauſe eſpeciallie doth S. Paull ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and ſo earneſtlie giue vs warning, to <hi>beware of traditions,</hi> leſt that Chriſtes benefit ſhould be transferred to traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, leſt the glorie of Chriſt ſhould be obſcured, leſt that true and ſound comforte ſhould be withheld from mens conſciences, and in a worde, leſt that faith, that is, truſt of the mercie of Chriſt, ſhoulde be quite ſmothered. Theſe daungers Saint Paull would haue auoided. For it is greatlie needfull that the pure doctrine of the benefit of Chriſt, of the righteouſnes of faith, and of the comforte of conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſhould be continued in the Church.</p>
                  <p>Secondlie, theſe traditions haue obſcured the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundemenss of God: for this kinde of ſchooling was thought to be ſpirituall, and the righteouſnes of a Chriſtian man. Yea, the traditions of men were ſet aloft aboue the commaundements of God. All Chriſtianitie was placed in
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:8251:236"/>
the obſeruation of certaine feſtiuall daies, rites, faſtes, and forme of apparell. Theſe beggerlie rudiments caried good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie titles, namelie, that they were the ſpirituall life, and the perfection of a Chriſtian. In the meane while, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements of God touching euerie calling were of ſmall eſtimation: that the Father brought vp his children, that the Mothet bare them, that the Prince gouerned the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, theſe workes were litle ſet by. They were not taken to be any ſeruice of God. The mindes of many ſtoode in a continuall mamering, whether mariage, magiſtracie, and ſuch like functions of a ciuill life, did pleaſe God or no. And this doubtfullnes did trouble manie verie much. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie forſaking their callings, leauing the common welth, did ſhut vp themſelues in monaſteries, that they might ſeeke that kinde of life, which they thought did more pleaſe God, yea which they ſuppoſed, to merit remiſſion of ſinnes.</p>
                  <p>Thirdlie, the opinion of neceſſitie did much vexe and diſquiet the conſciences.

                  <p>We ſee that the Summiſts &amp; diuines gather together the traditions, and ſeeke out qualifications of them, for the vnburdening of mens conſciences: but euen they cannot ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie themſelues, nor winde themſelues out: and ſometimes alſo their verie interpretations themſelues doe ſnare men<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The ſchooles alſo and pulpits were ſo buſied in numbring vp the traditions, that they had no leaſure to handle the Scripture, or to ſearch out more profitable doctrine of faith, of the Croſſe, of hope, of the excellencie of ciuill affaires, or of the comfort of mens conſciences in ſore tentations. Wherfore manie good men haue oft com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, that they were hindered by theſe contentions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout traditions, that they could not be occupied in ſome better kinde of doctrine. When as therefore ſuch ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious opinions did cleaue faſt vnto the traditions, it was neceſſarie to admoniſh the Churches, what they were
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:8251:236"/>
to iudge of traditions, to free godlie mindes from errour, to cure wounded conſciences, and to ſet out the benefit of Chriſt.

                  <p>Thus therefore we teach, touching ceremonies brought into the Church by mans authoritie.

                     <hi>We muſt obey God rather then men.</hi> Of this ſort is the tradition of ſingle life. Secondlie, touching other ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, which are in their owne nature thinges indifferent, as Faſtes, Feſtiuall daies, difference of apparell, and the like, we muſt know that ſuch obſeruations do neither merit remiſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſion of ſins, neither yet are they the righteouſnes or perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Chriſtian, but that they are things indifferent, which, where is no daunger of giuing offence, maie welbe omitted.</p>
                  <p>This iudgement of ours hath theſe euident and cleare teſtimonies in the Goſpell, to the ende that it maie admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the Church, that the Goſpell be not oppreſſed and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured by ſuperſtitious opinions. Rom. 14. <hi>The kingdome of God is not meat and drinke, but righteouſnes, peace, and ioy in the holie Ghoſt.</hi> Here Paull teacheth plainelie, that a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans righteouſnes is the ſpirituall motions of the hearr, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Colloſſ. 2. <hi>Let no man iudge you in meate, drinke, or a parte of a a holie daic.</hi> He forbiddeth that their conſciences ſhould be iudged, that is, that their conſciences ſhoulde be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in the vſe of ſuch thinges: but will haue them counted altogether indifferent thinges, and ſuch as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine not to the righteouſnes of the Goſpell. Then there followeth along and a weightie ſpeach, both of the rites of Moſes, and of the ceremonies appointed by the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of man. For Paull ſpeaketh namelie of both kindes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying them to be the righteouſnes of a Chriſtian, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding to burden the conſciences with ſuch traditions. <hi>If ye be dead with Chriſt from the rudiments of the world: why, as though ye liued in the world, are ye burdened with traditions? Touch</hi>

                     <hi>not, taſte not, handle not.</hi> Mat. 15. <hi>All that entreth into the mouth, defileth not the man.</hi> And in that place Chriſt excuſeth his diſciples, that had broken a tradition, that was in vſe among them, &amp; he addeth a notable ſaying, <hi>They worſhip me in vaine with the commaundements of men.</hi> He denieth mans precepts to be true duties, auaileable vnto righteouſnes before God. Wherefore they are not the righteouſnes of a Chriſtian, nor yet neceſſarie duties.</p>
                  <p>Yet for all that it is apparant, how wonderfullie the ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces inuented by man haue multiplied and increaſed in the Church vnto this daie. The Monks did dailie heape vp cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies both with new ſuperſtitions, &amp; alſo with new waies to bring in monie. And theſe trifles were thought to be the chiefeſt worſhip of God, and the greateſt godlines, whereas Chriſt doth by a moſte graue and weightie oracle forbid, that ſuch ceremonies ſhould be accounted for ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices of God. For he doth not forbid the appointing of tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions vnto a ciuill ende and vſe, that is, for good orders ſake, but he denieth that anie ſuch be anie worſhip of God, in ſaying, <hi>In vaine doe they worſhippe me.</hi> And he teacheth that true worſhippes be workes commaunded of God, as feare, faith, loue, patience, chaſtitie, walking in ones calling, doing of ones duety, &amp;c.

For it is no ſleight reproofe, when he ſaith, <hi>Why tempt ye God?</hi> And, 1. Tim. 4. He tearmeth the forbidding of meates, mariages, and ſuch like traditions, <hi>doctrines of Deuils.</hi> But why doth he vſe ſuch a ſharpe ſpeach? His meaning was not that there ſhould be no ordinances at all, or that no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of places and times ſhould be obſerued: but then he accounteth them to be doctrines of deuils, when as the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of Chriſt is attributed vnto them, when they are repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for righteouſnes, and for neceſſarie ſeruices of God, when an opinion of neceſſirie is faſtned to them, and mens
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:8251:237"/>
conſciences are racked, and faith made of no force by them. Theſe diſcommodities Chriſt and his Apoſtles would haue to be diligentlie auoided, and for that cauſe they crie out ſo often, and ſo earneſtlie againſt traditions. And it is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that the patrones of ſuch ſuperſtitious opinions about traditions, are no whitte mooued with ſuch thundering ſpeaches.</p>
                  <p>Now as for vs, we teach that thoſe traditions are not to be condemned, which commaund nothing againſt the lawes of God, and haue a ciuill vſe and end, namelie, ſuch as are ordained to this ende, that thinges might be done orderlie in the Church. Of which ſorte are the traditions about ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie daies, the Lordes dare, the Natiuitie, Paſſeouer, and the reſt: alſo about the holie readings and leſſons, and ſuch like. Now all rites of this kinde we reteyne verie willinglie in our Churches. And yet the Church is taught, to know, what to thinke of ſuch cuſtomes, to witte, that they doe not merit remiſſion of ſinnes, that they are not the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of a Chriſtian, nor neceſſarie duties vnto chriſtian righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes, but indifferent things, which a man maie omitte, where there is no daunger of giuing offence. This qualify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of traditions doth ſet free the conſciences from ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious opinions, and from that olde torture and racking. And ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> it bringeth great commendation to traditions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſheweth the true vſe of them. All modeſt men will more willinglie obey the tradititions, after they vnderſtand that their conſciences are ſet free from daunger in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate, &amp; that they muſt ſo farre obey, as that the common peace be not diſturbed, nor the weake ones hurte. Againe, this interpretation doth defend and preſerue publique good manners and diſcipline, becauſe it commaundeth to auoid offences. Alſo to obſerue publike holie daies, the mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings in the Churches, readinges, &amp;c. doe ſerue for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and to accuſtome the youth, and the common ſorte thereto. Therefore ſuch ordinances are not to be broken, but rather with common care and trauell to be furthered.</p>
                  <p>Theſe be the true and meete commendations of traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which no doubt doe greatlie ſtirre vp ſuch as are godlie and ſtaied, to loue, defend, and adorne the publique orders. The Goſpell teacheth to thinke reuerentlie, not onelie of
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:8251:238"/>
other ciuill lawes and orders, but alſo of Eccleſiaſticall, and ſeeketh the true vſe of them. Yet notwithſtanding it appointeth degrees, and will haue the doctrine touching Chriſt, and thinges that are heauenlie and euerlaſting, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned from the ſchooling, or Pedagogie of the Church. This libertie, whereof we ſpeake now, was not vnknowne to the Fathers. For Auguſtine ſaith, <hi>This whol kinde of thinges hath free obſeruations;</hi> and to this purpoſe he diſcourſeth at large. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> ſaith, <hi>The diſagreement in Faſting doth not breake of the agreement in Faith.</hi> The Tripartite hiſtory gathereth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether manie examples of rites diſagreeing one from the other, and in the end addeth a notable ſaying, <hi>It was not the Apoſtles minde, to preſcribe anie thing touching holie daies, but to preach godlines, and a good conuerſation.</hi> But in ſo manifeſt a matter, it is needles to heap vp manie teſtimonies.</p>
                  <p>But our aduerſaries doe here make great outcries, <hi>That by this doctrine publike diſcipline and order is ouerthrowne, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order and anarchie brought in. Likewiſe, that good workes and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of the fleſh are aboliſhed, according to Iouinians ſurmiſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> Theſe ſlaunders we haue partlie refuted alreadie: there is no confuſion or anarchie brought in, nor the publique diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline ouerthrowne, when as wee teach, that traditions, which haue a ciuill end and vſe, ought to be obſerued. And we teach alſo that offences muſt be foreſeene and auoided. But touching mortification, we anſwere thus: True and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned mortification is to beare the croſſe, to indure daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, troubles, and afflictions. This kinde of obedience is the worſhip of God, and a ſpirituall worke, as the Pſal. tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth: <hi>A ſacrifice to God is a troubled ſpirit, &amp;c.</hi> We teach moreouer that another kinde of exerciſe is neceſſarie. It is the dutie of euerie Chriſtian to bridle his fleſh, euen by bodelie diſcipline, labours, temperancie, meditation of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenlie thinges, and ſuch other exerciſes, fitte for his age. The neereſt and proper end whereof muſt be this, that ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and idlenes doe not prick him forward to ſinne, and that his minde maie be ſtirred vp, and made more apt for heauenlie affections. It is not to be thought, that theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes are a worſhip of God, that deſerue remiſſion of ſinnes, or that they be ſatisfactions, &amp;c. And this diſcipline muſt be continuall: neither can certaine daies be ſette and
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:8251:238"/>
appointed equallie for all. Of this diſcipline Chriſt ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth: <hi>Beware that your bodies be not oppreſſed with ſurfeting.</hi> Againe, <hi>This kinde of Deuills doth not goe out, but by faſting and praier.</hi> And Paull ſaith, <hi>I chaſtice my bodie, and bring it in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage.</hi> Wherefore we do not miſlike faſtings, but ſuperſtitious opinions, which be ſnares for mens conſciences, that are put in traditions.

For firſt the doctrine of grace, is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured by it, and alſo the righteouſnes of faith, which is the moſte eſpeciall point of the Goſpell, and which it behoueth moſte of all to be extant, and to haue the preheminence in the Church, that the merit of Chriſt maie be well knowen, and faith, which beleueth that ſinnes are remitted through Chriſt, and not for anie workes of ours, maie be exal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ed farre aboue workes. For which cauſe alſo Saint Paull labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth much in this point: he remooueth the law and humane traditions, that he may ſhew that the righteouſnes of Chriſt i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> a farre other thing, then ſuch workes as theſe be, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, a faith, which beleeueth that ſinnes are freely remitted
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:8251:239"/>
through Chriſt. But this doctrine of Saint Paull is almoſt wholie ſmothered by traditions, which haue breade an opinion, that by making difference in meates and ſuch like ſeruices, a man muſt merit remiſſion of ſinnes and iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In their doctrine of repentance there was no mention of faith: onelie theſe ſatisfactorie works were ſpoken of: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance ſeemed to ſtand whollie in theſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondlie, theſe traditions obſcured the Commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, that they could not be knowne, becauſe that traditions were preferred far aboue the commaundementes of God. All Chriſtianitie was thought to be an obſeruation of certeine holie daies, rites, faſtes, and attire. Theſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruations caried a goodlie title and name, that they were the ſpirituall life, and the perfect life. In the meane ſeaſon Gods commaundements touching euerie mans calling, were of ſmall eſtimation. That the father brought vp his children, that the mother bare them, that the prince gouerned the common wealth, theſe were reputed worldly affaires, and vnperfect and farre inferior to thoſe gliſtering obſeruations &amp; orders. And theſe errors did greatly torment good mindes, which were grieued that they were hande-faſted to an vnperfect kinde of life, in mariage, in Magiſtracy, and in other ciuill functions. They had the Monkes and ſuch like men in admiration, and falſelie ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, that their orders did more deſerue remiſſion of ſinnes and iuſtification.</p>
                  <p>Thirdlie, traditions brought great daunger to mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, becauſe it was not poſſible to keepe them all, and yet men thought the obſeruation of them to be neceſſarie duties. Gerſon writeth, that manie fell into deſpaire, and ſome murthered themſelues, becauſe they perceiued that they could not keepe the traditions: and all this while they neuer heard the comforte of the righteouſnes of faith, or of grace. We ſee the Summiſtes and diuines gather toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the traditions, and ſeeke qualifications of them; to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burden mens conſciences: and yet all will not ſerue, but ſom times they bring more ſnares vpon the conſcience. The ſchooles and pulpits haue bene ſo buſied in gathering toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the traditions, that they had not leiſure once to touch the ſcripture, and to ſeeke out a more profitable doctrine, of
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:8251:239"/>
faith, of the croſſe, of hope, of the dignitie of ciuill affaires, of the comfort of conſciences in perilous aſſaultes. Wherfore Gerſon and ſome other diuines haue made grieuous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints that they were hindered by braules about traditions, that they could not be occupied in ſome better kinde of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. And Saint Auguſtine forbiddeth that mens conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſhould be burdened with ſuch kinde of obſeruations, &amp; doth verie wiſelie warne Ianuarius to know, that they are to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be obſerued indifferentlie: for ſo he ſpeaketh: <hi>Wherefore our miniſters muſt not be thought, to haue touched this matter vnadui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedlie for hatred of the Biſhops, as ſome do falſelie ſurmiſe. There was great need to admoniſh the Churches of thoſe errours, which did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe from miſtaking of traditions: for the Goſpell driueth men to vrge the doctrine of grace, and of the righteouſnes of faith, in the Church: which yet can neuer be vnderſtord, if men ſuppoſe that they can merit remiſſion of ſinnes, and iuſtification, by obſeruations of their owne choice.</hi> Thus therefore they haue taught vs, that we can neuer merit remiſſion of ſinnes and iuſtification, by the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of mans traditions: and therefore that we muſt not thinke, that ſuch obſeruations are neceſſarie dueties. Hereunto they adde teſtimonies out of the ſcriptures. Chriſt excuſeth his diſciples, Math. 15. which kept not the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued tradition, which yet ſeemed to be about a matter not vnlawfull, but indifferent, and to haue ſome affinitie with the waſhings of the lawe, and ſaith, <hi>They worſhippe me in vaine with the precepts of men.</hi> Chriſt therefore requireth no vnprofitable worſhip: and a litle after, he addeth, <hi>All that entreth in at the mouth de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Therfore we do not condemne faſts themſelues, but the traditions, which preſcribe certeine daies and certeine meates, with daunger to the conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as though ſuch workes as theſe were neceſſary duties.</p>
                  <p>Yet many of the traditions are obſerued among vs, which tend vnto this end, that things may be done orderlie in the Church, as namelie the <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 1. obſeru. vp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pon this confeſſ.</note>order of leſſons in the Maſſe, and the chiefeſt holie daies. But in the meane time men are admoniſhed, that ſuch a ſeruice doth not iuſtifie before god, and that there is no ſinne to be put in ſuch thinges, if they be left vndone, ſo it be without offence This libertie in humane rites &amp; ceremonies was not vnknowne to the fathers.

                  </p>
                  <p>What is then to be thought of the Lords day, and of ſuch like rites vſed in Churches? Hereunto they anſwer, that it is lawful for the Biſhops or Paſtors to appoint ordinances, wherby things may be done in order in the Church, not that by them we ſhould merit remiſſion of ſinnes, or ſatisfie for ſinnes, or that mens conſciences ſhould be bound to eſteme them as neceſſarie ſeruices, and thinke that they ſinne, when they violate any one of them, though it be without the offence of others. So Paull ordeined, <hi>that weomen ſhould couer their heads in the congregation, that the Interpreters of ſcripture ſhould be heard in courſe or order in the Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Such like ordinances it behooueth the Churches to kepe for charitie, and quietnes ſake, ſo farre forth, that one offend not another, that all thinges maie be done in order, and without tumult in the Church: but yet with this caution, that mens conſciences be not burdened, ſo as they ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count them as things neceſſarie to ſaluation, and thinke they did ſinne, when they break anie one of them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offence of others: as no man would ſaie that a woman doth offend, if ſhe come abroade with his head vncouered, without the offence of anie.</p>
                  <p>Of this ſort is the obſeruation of the Lords day, of Eaſter, of Pentecoſt, and ſuch like holie daies, and rites. For they that thinke, that the obſeruation of the Lords daie was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the authoritie of the Church in ſtead of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both, as neceſſarie, they are greatlie deceiued.

And yet becauſe it was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to appoint a certeine daie, that the people might know when to come together, it ſeemeth that the Church did for that purpoſe appoint the Lords daie: which daie for this cauſe alſo ſemed to haue better liked the Church, that in it

men might haue an example of Chriſtian liberty, and might know, that the obſeruation, neither of the Sabboth, nor of any other daie, was of neceſſitie.</p>
                  <p>There are extant certeine monſtrous diſputations, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the chaunging of the law, and the ceremoies of the new law, and of the change of the change of the Sabboth, which did al ſpring vp of a falſe perſuaſion, that there ſhould be a worſhip in the Church, like to the Leuiticall worſhip: and that Chriſt gaue the charge of deuiſing new ceremonies, which ſhould be neceſſarie to ſaluation, to the Apoſtles and Biſhops. Theſe er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors crept into the Church, when as the doctrine of faith was not plainly inough taught.

                  <p>FAſting hath it praiſe and vſe, But now we do not ſpeake either of neceſſarie faſting, when as a man muſt needs faſt for want of meat, or of an allegoricall faſting, which is to abſtaine from all vices: but we are to ſpeake of two vſuall kindes of faſting, whereof the one is a perpetuall faſte, and this is a ſobrietie, which is alwaies to be kept, in meate and drink, throughout the wholl courſe of a mans life. for it is neuer lawfull for vs to rauine, and to follow ſurfeting, and dronkennes. There is another faſt, which is for a daie, when as ſometimes we abſtaine from meate the wholl daie, ſuch as was vſed in the olde Teſtament, Leuit. 16. Alſo the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of Ioſaphat, of the Niniuites, and others, doe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes the ſame thing. This kinde of faſting was alſo vſed after the publiſhing of the Goſpell, as appeereth, Act. 13. and 14. But afterward there folowed a great difference in Churches touching the obſeruation of ſuch a kinde of faſting: and as this difference brought no diſcommoditie to the Church, ſo it teſtified, that the vſe of this faſting was free. And there is a worthie ſaying among the auncient fathers, touching this varietie: <hi>The difference,</hi> ſaie they, <hi>of faſtings doeth not break of the agreement of faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now although ſome men doe thinke, that Chriſt by his example did conſecrate, <hi>the faſt of Lent,</hi> yet it is manifeſt, that Chriſt did not commaunde this faſt, neither can the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of our nature abide it, that we ſhould imitate the example of Chriſt his faſting, who did abſtaine full 40. dates, and 40. nightes, from all meate and drinke. Alſo Euſebius doth declare, and that not obſcurelie, <hi>That the vſe of this Lenten faſt was very free in the Church.</hi> Moreouer Chryſoſtome, <hi>in Gen. cap.</hi> 2. <hi>Hom.</hi> 11. ſaith, <hi>If thou canſt not faſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet thou maist abſtaine from ſinnes: and this is not the leaſt thing, nor much diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring from faſting, but fit to ouerthrow euen the fury of the Deuill</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Neither was there anie choiſe of meates appointed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Apoſtle had ſaide, <hi>To the cleane, all thinges are cleane.</hi> But in the obſeruation of ſuch faſtes, we muſt chiefely marke the ende. The auncient fathers did ſometimes faſt whole daies together, that they might giue themſelues to publique praier, and by this diſcipline might admoniſh their Church,
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:8251:242"/>
and eſpecially the youth, of daungers that were paſt, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, or hanging ouer their heades, and might ſtirre them vp to repentance, wherby the wrath of God might be aſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. This is the godlie, and profitable ende of theſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinges.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Others doe faſte,</hi> That by the merit of this worke, they maie purge their ſinnes before God, or, <hi>as ſome doe ſpeake,</hi> Applie vnto themſelues the merit of Christ, by their faſting. <hi>But this end is vtterlie to be condemned. For firſt, the onelie death of Chriſt is the purging of our ſinnes. Secondlie, faſting was not ordeined for this vſe, that it ſhould be a worke, whereby the merit of Chriſt maie be applied to vs. For, faſting is either ioyned with true repentance, and then the merit of Chriſt is applied to him that repenteth by faith, which is the chiefe parte of repentance, before a man doth beginne or ende his faſting: or elſe faſting is without repentance, and then it is abhominable in the ſight of God, ſo farre is it from applying the merit of Chriſt to him that faſteth. Iſa 58.</hi> Is it ſuch a fast that I haue choſen, that a man ſhould afflict his ſoule for a daie, and to bowe downe his head as a bulruſh? <hi>Auguſtine</hi> Epiſt. <hi>86.</hi> ad Caſulanum, <hi>ſaith,</hi> I reuoluing that in my minde, which is written in the Euangelicall and Apoſtolique Scriptures, and in that wholl inſtrument which they call the new Testament, doe ſee that faſting is commaunded. But on what daies we ought not to faſt, and on what daies, we ought to faſt, I doe not ſee it defined, either by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of the Lorde, or of the Apostles. And by this I thinke, that rather a releaſing, then a binding to fasting, is the more fit and apt, not to obtaine righteouſnes (wherein the beutie of the Kings daughter doth conſiſt inwardly) which is obtained by Faith, but yet, to ſignifie a perpetuall rest. <hi>And Chryſoſtome,</hi> Tom. <hi>4.</hi> de Ieiun. Quadrag. Hom. <hi>73. ſaieth:</hi> If we come dailie hither, and fast the wholl Lent, and doe not chaunge our life to the better, it will be an occaſion of our greater condemnation. <hi>By theſe teſtimonies it is euident, that it is neither Apoſtolique<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor Catholique, to thinke that faſting is a worke, whereby either ſinnes are purged before God, or the merit of Chriſt is applied.</hi>

                     </hi> But where as in the new Teſtament, water is conſecrated, which they call <hi>holie water,</hi> by the ſprinkling whereof veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſinnes are taken awaie, and Deuills are driuen awaie: and whereas ſalte alſo is conſecrated, to make thinges whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, which otherwiſe be hurtfull, it ſeemeth neither to be Apoſtolique, nor Catholique. For we are not commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the worde of God to imitate the Leuitical ſprinkling, or Elizeus his miracle, but it was vſed by mans arbitrement &amp; pleaſure: &amp; therfore it pertaineth to this ſaying of Chriſt, <hi>In vaine do they worſhip me, teaching for doctrines the preceptes of men.</hi> And it is euident that the ſprinkling of the bloode of Chriſt, which is made by the worde of the Goſpell, by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, and the Lordes Supper, and receiued by faith, doth purge vs from our ſinnes. That therefore which is proper to the blood of Chriſt, which by the ordinance of god was ſhed for our ſins, ought not to be attributed towater, conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the appointment of man. And <hi>as touching that Elizeus did heale the barren waters by ſalte,</hi> there is a miracle ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eies, that thereby we may confirme that credit, which we ought to giue to the preaching of the Prophet; but it is not ſet before vs to be imitated without a ſpecial calling of God: becauſe the miracles of the Saints vſe not to be generall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but perſonall.</p>
                  <p>And as touching that which Paull ſaith, <hi>that creatures are ſanctified by the worde of God, and by praier,</hi> he meaneth not that creatures, as for example, ſalt, fleſh, egges<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hearbes, are to be coniured, that Sathan by the vſe of them may be driuen awaie; but that all creatures are by the worde of God e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie one appointed to their outward vſe, which then ſerue

for our good, when we vſe them well, by faith, and praying vnto God. So God created ſalt, to ſeaſon meat, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue fleſh from putrifying: he created water, to ſerue for drinke, or waſhing, or watering, and not to driue away the Deuill. In deede in Baptiſme, he ordeined <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 1. obſeru. vp on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſ. of Saxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Sect. 13.</note>water to waſh awaie ſinnes: but this is not the generall ende why water was created, but a ſpeciall ordinance, appointed by a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all worde of God. For, as touching the generall creation and ſanctification of God, there is no worde of God, that doth witnes, that the creatures, which we before haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed, by coniurings are made profitable hereunto, that they may take awaie ſinnes, and chaſe away the deuils. Now that which is brought in without the worde of God, to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vſe then God hath ordeined it vnto, it cannot be done in faith, but it becommeth an abuſe, &amp; doth rather bring de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, then ſaluation, Rom. 14 <hi>Whatſoeuer is not of faith, is ſinne.</hi> And Cyprian, <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 2. <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. ſaith. <hi>If Chriſt alone is to be heard, we are not to conſider what any other before vs hath thought good to be done, but what Chriſt, who is before all, hath done: for we ought not to follow the cuſtome of men, but the trueth of God, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>ALthough in deede there is no difference, betweene a Saint reſting in Chriſt, and a faithfull man depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted (for euerie one which dieth in the faith of Chriſt, is a Saint) yet becauſe it hath pleaſed ſome to put a difference betwixt theſe two, we alſo thought it good to make two ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Chapters thereof. And firſt, we thinke, that it belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to a godlie minde, to make decent mention of his elders which haue died in the faith of Chriſt, and to ſhew forth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde their poſteritie and friendes which are aliue, in all duetifull manner that we can, that thankefullnes, which is due to thoſe benefits, which we receiued of them. Secondly, faith requireth of vs, that we doe not thinke that the dead are nothing, but that they doe in deede liue before God: to wit, that the godlie doe liue bleſſedlie in Chriſt: and that the wicked doe liue in an horrible expectation of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation of the iudgement of God. Alſo, charitie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, that wee ſhoulde wiſh all peace and happines to them that are dead in Chriſt. This alſo is to be added, that, to teſtifie the hope of our reſurrection, we muſte burie our dead decently, ſo neere as may be, and as the time, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of men will ſuffer. <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But that the dead are helped by thoſe vſuall watchings, praiers, and ſacrifices, and that by the merites thereof, they be either deliuered from their paines, or obtaine a greater felicitie which is in heauen, there is no teſtimonie out of

that doctrine which is in deede Propheticall and Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call. For there is one onelie merit of eternall life, and we haue one onely redemption and deliuerance, to wit, the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt: and this merit is made ours, when we beleeue in Chriſt, and we haue nothing to doe with it, when we do not beleeue the Goſpell of Chriſt.

Cap. 6. ſaith: <hi>We are taught by this ſmall ſentence, though obſcurelie, a new point of doctrine which lieth hid, to wit, that whileſt we be in this preſent worlde, we may helpe one an other, either by praiers, or by counſell: but when we ſhall come before the tribunall ſeate of Chriſt, it is not Iob, nor Daniell, nor Noe, that can intreate any thing for vs, but euerie man ſhall beare his own burthen.</hi> For, as touching that which is cited out of the Machabees, <hi>That ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices were offered for the ſinnes of the dead,</hi> the Author himſelfe of the booke doth doubt, in the end of the booke, whether he hath written well, &amp; <hi>craueth pardon, if in any point he hath erred.</hi> Therefore let vs pardon him that without any authoritie of the holie Scripture he affirmeth, <hi>that the dead are freed from their ſinne by the ſacrifices, and praiers of them that be aliue.</hi> And Tertullian ſaith, <hi>Oblations are made one day euerie yeare for them that are dead:</hi> But this was either receiued without autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the word of God, from the cuſtomes of the heathen, as many other things were; or by the name of <hi>Oblation</hi> we muſt vnderſtand a publique rememberance of thoſe which died in the faith of Chriſt, and a thankeſgiuing for thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefittes

                  <p>ALthough we ought not to doubt, but that the Saints haue their Purgatorie fire in this life, as the examp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les of Dauid, Ezechias, Ionas, and others doe witnes, yet it is not without cauſe doubted, whether that after this life there be ſuch a Purgatorie, as the common ſort of men doe thinke there is, wherein the ſoules be ſo long tormented, till either by their puniſhment they doe ſatisfie for their ſinnes, or be redeemed by Indulgences. For if Purgatorie be ſuch a thing, it is much to be merueiled at, that neither the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, nor the Apoſtles haue in their writings deliuered vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs any thing thereof certeinelie, and plainlie, but rather doe teach, and that not obſcurely, the cleane contrarie. Mar. 16. <hi>Preach ye the Goſpell to euerie creature: he that ſhal beleeue, and be baptized, ſhall be ſaued: but he that will not beleeue, ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</hi> Here be two degrees of men placed: the one, of them, which beleeue the Goſpel, and they are pronounced, <hi>ſaued:</hi> the other, of them, which doe not beleeue the Goſpell, and theſe are pronounced, <hi>condemned:</hi> there is no meane betwixt theſe two. For either thou doeſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parte out of this life in the faith of Ieſus Chriſt, and then thou haſt remiſſion of thy ſinnes for Chriſt his ſake, and the righteouſnes of Chriſt is imputed to thee. Therefore he which dieth, beeing accompanied with Chriſt, he wanteth nothing toward the obteining of true and eternall life: but he which departeth from hence without Chriſt, goeth into eternall darkenes.</p>
                  <p>If beſide theſe two degrees there were ſome other third ſtate of ſoules in an other world, certeinlie Paul, <hi>Who was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vp into Paradiſe, and into the third heauen, &amp; ſaw many ſecret things,</hi> would not haue enuied the Church this knowledge. But ſee, when he doth of ſet purpoſe write to the Theſſalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, concerning Chriſtians that ſleepe, he maketh no mention at all of anie Purgatorie, but rather willeth them, <hi>Not to be ſorofull, euen as others which haue no hope.</hi> Therefore if there were anie ſuch ſtate of ſoules in another world, as
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:8251:245"/>
the common people thinketh there is, Paull could not be withh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But the true and Catholike Church in deed, hath plainelie ſhewed that ſhee hath no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie at all concerning this third kinde of the ſtate of ſoules in another world. Chryſoſtome in his ſecond ſermon of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus, ſaieth, <hi>If thou haſt violently taken anie thing from anie man, reſtore it, and ſaie, as doth Zacheus, If I haue taken from anie man by forged cauillation, I reſtore fourefoulde. If thou art become an enimie to anie man, be reconciled before thou come to iudgement. Diſcharge all thinges here, that without greefe thou maiſt beholde that tribunall ſeat. Whileſt we be here, we haue manie excellent hopes. But ſo ſoone as we depart thither, it is not then in our power to repent, nor to waſh awaie our ſinnes.</hi> And againe, <hi>He that in this preſent life ſhall not waſh awaie his ſinnes, ſhall not finde any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte afterward.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Auguſtine, although he place certaine men in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt, betiwxt them, that be verie good, and thoſe that be verie euill, to the one ſorte whereof he ſeemeth to aſſigne the place of Purgatorie, yet in other places he doubteth of that matter, and doth not define anie certaintie. Therefore we muſt ſo thinke of this opinion of Auguſtine, as he requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that is, we muſt receiue that, which is confirmed, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the authority of the Scripture, or by probable reaſon. But it is euident, that thoſe places of the Scripture, which are commonlie cited, to eſtabliſh Purgatorie, are wreſted from the naturall, to a ſtraunge ſenſe, and are farre other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe expounded, euen of the a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Wherefore we thinke, that this ſpeculation of Purgatorie fire, is to be left to it owne authors, and that we muſt chiefely doe this, as Paull exhorteth vs, that we maie confirme our ſelues one another with ſpeaches touching the aſſured faith of our reſurrection, and ſaluation in Chriſt Ieſus, for whoſe

And praier is a lifting vp of the minde vnto God, and ſuch a familiar ſpeach with him, as no other thing can ſo greatlie ſet a man on fire with heauenlie affections, &amp; more mightelie make the minde comformable to the will of God.

                  <p>BVt becauſe that no mindes, but theſe that be ardent, and peculiarlie ſtirred vp by the heauenlie inſpiration, can either praie, or faſte aright, and with profit, we beleeue that it is farre better, after the example of the Apoſtles, and the former &amp; more ſincere Church, by holie exhortations to inuite men hereunto, then to wring them out by preceptes,
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:8251:246"/>
ſuch eſpeciallie, as doe binde men vnder paine of deadlie ſinne: the which thing the Prieſtes that were of late toke vpon them to doe, when as then the order of Prieſtes had not a litle degenerated. But we had rather leaue the place<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, and manner, both of praying, and alſo of faſting, to the arbitrement of the holie Ghoſt, then to preſcribe them by certaine lawes, eſpeciallie ſuch, as maie not be broken without ſome ſacrifice of amends. Yet for their ſakes that be the younger, and more imperfect ſorte, our Preachers doe not diſlike, that there ſhould be an appointed time and meanes, both for prayer, and alſo for faſting, that as it were by theſe holie introductions to exerciſes they might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared hereunto, ſo that it be done, without bynding of the conſcience. We were induced thus to thinke, not ſo much for that all compulſion being againſt a mans will, is repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the nature of theſe actions, but rather, becauſe that neither Chriſt himſelfe, nor anie of his Apoſtles, haue in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny place made mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſuch kinde of precepts: &amp; this doth <note place="margin">In Math. hom. <hi>47.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Moreouer, we doe not read, that anie ſolemne or ſet faſte was enioyned to the auncient Church, but that faſte of one daie. For thoſe faſtes, which as the ſcripture doth witnes, were ordeyned of Prophets, and of Kinges, it is certaine, that they were no ſet faſtes, but enioyned onelie for their time, to wit, when as euident calamities, either hanging ouer their heads, or preſentlie pinching them, did ſo require it. Seeing therfore that the Scripture, as S. Paull doth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, doth inſtruct a man to euerie good worke, and yet is ignorant of theſe faſtes which are extorted by precepts, we doe not ſee, how it could be lawful for the ſucceſſours of the
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:8251:247"/>
Apoſtles, to ouercharge the Church with ſo great and ſo daungerous a burthen. Truelie, <hi>Irenaeus</hi> doth witnes, <hi>that in times paſt the obſeruation of faſte in Churches was diuers, and free,</hi> as it is reade in the Eccleſiaſticall hiſtorie, lib. 8. cap. 14. In the ſame booke <hi>Euſebius</hi> maketh mention, that one Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonius, an Eccleſiaſticall writer among other arguments vſed this for one, to confute the doctrine of Montanus the heretike, <hi>Becauſe he was the firſt that made lawes for faſtes.</hi> Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaith in a vertaine place, <hi>Faſting is good, but let no man be compelled thereunto.</hi> And in another place he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth <hi>him that is not able to faſte, to abſteyne from deinties,</hi> and yet affirmeth, <hi>that it doth not much differ from faſting, and that it is a ſtrong weapon to repreſſe the furie of the Deuill.</hi> Moreouer, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience alſo it ſelfe doth more then prooue, that theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts concerning faſtes, haue bin a great hinderance to god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines.</p>
                  <p>Therefore when we ſaw it verie euidentlie, that the chiefe men in the Church, did beſide the authoritie of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, take vpon themſelues this power, ſo to enioyne faſtes, as to binde mens conſciences vnder paine of deadlie ſinne, we did looſe the conſciences out of theſe ſnares, but by the Scriptures, and chiefely by Pauls writinges, which doe with a ſingular endeauour remooue theſe rudiments of the world from the necks of Chriſtians. For wee ought not lightlie to account of that ſaying of Paull: <hi>Let no man condemne you in meate and drinke, or in reſpect of an holie daie, or of the new Moone, or of the Sabbath daies.</hi> And againe, <hi>Therefore if ye be dead with Chriſt from the rudiments of the worlde, why, as though ye li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the worlde, are ye burdened with traditions?</hi> For if S. Paull, then whome no man at any time did teach Chriſt more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainelie, doe earneſtlie affirme, that through Chriſt wee haue obteined ſuch libertie in outwarde thinges, that he doth not onelie not giue authoritie to anie creature, to bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den thoſe which beleeue in Chriſt, no not ſo much as with thoſe ceremonies and obſeruations, which notwithſtanding God himſelfe appointed, and would haue to be profitable in their time; but alſo denounceth, <hi>that they be fallen awaie from Chriſt, and that Chriſt ſhall nothing at all profitte them,</hi> who ſuffer themſelues to be addicted thereunto; what ſhall wee then thinke of thoſe commaundements, which men haue
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:8251:247"/>
deuiſed of their owne braine, not onelie without anie oracle, but alſo without anie example worthie to be followed, and which are therefore made vnto manie not onelie beggerlie and weake, but alſo hurtfull, not elements, that is, rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of holie diſcipline, but alſo impediments of true god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines? How much more vniuſtlie ſhall anie man take vnto himſelfe authoritie ouer the inheritance of Chriſt, to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe him with ſuch kinde of bondage? and how farre ſhall he remooue vs from Chriſt, if we ſubmit our ſelues vnto him? For who doth not ſee the glorie of Chriſt, to whom we ought whollie to liue, whome he hath whollie redeemed to himſelfe, and reſtored to libertie, and that by his blood, to be more obſcured, if beſide his authoritie, we doe binde our conſcience to thoſe lawes, which are the inuentions of men, then to thoſe which haue God for their author, although they were to be obſerued, but onelie for their time? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainelie it is a leſſe fault to play the Iewe, then the Heathen. Now it is the manner of the heathen; to receiue lawes for the worſhip of God, which haue their beginning from mans inuention onelie, God neuer being asked counſell of in the matter. Wherefore if in anie matter at all, certainlie here that ſaying of Paull taketh place: <hi>Ye are bought with a great</hi>

Moreouer it is againſt the ſcriprure, to ordeine or require the obſeruation of anie tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, to the ende that we might merit remiſſion of ſinnes, and ſatisfie for ſinnes by them. For the glorie of Chriſtes merit receiueth a blow, when as we ſeeke by ſuch obſeruations to merit remiſſion of ſinnes and iuſtification. And it is verie apparant, that through this perſuaſion tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions grew into an infinite number in the Church. In the meane while the doctrine of faith, and of the righteouſnes of faith, was quite ſmoothered: for euer and anone there were new holiedaies made, new faſtes appointed, new cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, new worſhippes for Saints ordeined, becauſe that the authors of ſuch geare ſuppoſed by theſe works to merit remiſſion of ſinnes and iuſtification. After the ſame manner heretofore did the penitential Canons increaſe, wherof we ſtill ſee ſome footings in ſatisfactions.</p>

the appointing whereof god committed to the Apoſtles and Biſhops, wherein they ſeeme to be deceiued by the example of the law of Moſes, as if the righteouſnes of the new teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were the outward obſeruing of certeine rites, as the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of the law was. Like as therefore in the lawe it was a ſinne to eate ſwines fleſh, &amp;c. ſo in the new teſtament they place ſinne in meates, in daies, in apparell, and ſuch like things: and they holde opinion, that the righteouſnes of the new teſtament can not ſtand without theſe. From hence are thoſe burdens, that certeine meates defile the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, that it is a mortall ſinne to omit the cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall houres, that faſtinges merit remiſſion of ſinnes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they be neceſſary to the righteouſnes of the new teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that a ſinne in a caſe reſerued, can not be pardoned, but by the authority of him that reſerued it: wheras the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons ſpeake onelie of reſeruing of canonicall puniſhments, and not of the reſeruing of the fault. Whence then haue the Biſhops power and authoritie of impoſing theſe traditions vpon the Churches, for the burdening of mens conſciences? For there are diuers cleare teſtimonies which inhibit the making of ſuch traditions, either for to deſerue remiſſion of ſinnes, or as thinges neceſſarie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the righteouſnes of the the new teſtament, or to ſaluation. Paull to the Coloſſ. 2. <hi>Let no man iudge you in meat, drinke, or a peece of a holie daie, in the new moone, or in the Sabboth.</hi> Againe, <hi>If ye be dead with Chriſt, from the rudiments of the world, why as though ye liued in the world, are ye burdened with traditions, as: Touch not, taſt not, han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle not, which all do periſh with the vſing, and are the preceptes and doctrines of men, which haue a ſhew of wiſedome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>It remaineth then, that ſeeing conſtitutions ordeined as
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:8251:255"/>
neceſſarie, or with opinion of meriting remiſſion of ſinnes by them, are flat repugnant to the goſpell, becauſe that it is not lawfull for any Biſhops to appoint or vrge anie ſuch worſhip. For it is verie requiſite, that the doctrine of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an liberty ſhould be manteined in the Church, becauſe that the bondage of the law is not neceſſarie vnto iuſtification, as it is written to the Gal. <hi>Come not ye vnder the yoke of bondage againe.</hi> It is neceſſarie that the chiefeſt point of all the goſpel ſhould be holden faſt, that we do freelie obteine remiſſion of ſinnes &amp; iuſtification by faith in Chriſt, &amp; not by anie ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruations, nor by any worſhip deuiſed by man. For though they ſeeke to qualifie traditions, yet the equitie of them can neuer be ſeene nor perceiued, ſo long as the opinion of neceſſitie remaineth, which muſt needes remaine, wher the righteouſnes of faith &amp; Chriſtian liberty are not known. The Apoſtles <hi>commaunded them to abſteine from blood:</hi> who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth that now a daies? and yet they do not ſinne that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue it not: for the Apoſtles them ſelues would not burden mens conſciences with ſuch a ſeruitude: but they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad it for a time, for offence ſake.

Alſo the commaundement of praying to the dead. It is an eaſy mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to giue ſentence of theſe lawes. For ſeeing they doe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtlie oppugne the commaundement of God, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles rule is, <hi>We ought rather to obeie God then men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The ſecond order is of thoſe rites, which concerne thinges in their owne nature indifferent,</hi> ſuch as are the lawes touching the difference of meates, and daies, and ſuch like thinges. But when falſe opinions are ioyned vnto theſe thinges, they are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o more indifferent. Now our aduerſaries doe, ſome
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:8251:256"/>
more, ſome leſſe, tie vnto them abſurde and falſe opinions, for the which both thoſe laws &amp; rites are to be caſt of, leſt anie corrupt worſhip ſhould be eſtabliſhed. The moſte parte do feigne, that the workes of mans traditions, as ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp; ſuch like, doe merit remiſſion of ſinnes. This opinion is apparantlie falſe: for it remooueth the benefit of Chriſt vnto mans traditions. And there needeth here no long confutation: we will content our ſelues with one thundring ſaying of Saint Paull, <hi>Ye are made void of Chriſt, whoſoeuer are iuſtified by the law: Ye are fallen from Chriſt.</hi> This ſaying teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that men doe not merit remiſſion of ſinnes by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per workes, either of Gods lawe, or of mans traditions. Others being put in minde, what groſſe abſurditie there is in this firſt errour, they beginne to talke more modeſtlie of tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions. But yet they houlde ſtill an errour, that is not to be borne with all. They ſaie, <hi>That theſe workes, though they doe not deſerue remiſſion of ſinnes, yet are they ſeruices of God, that is, workes, the immediat ende whereof is, that God by them might be honoured.</hi> This errour alſo muſt be ſtiffelie withſtoode. For Chriſt ſaieth plainelie, <hi>They worſhippe me in vaine with the preceptes of men.</hi> And Paull doth expreſſelie condemne <hi>will worſhippe</hi> to the Coloſſ. And ſeeing that the worſhippe of God muſt be done in faith, it is neceſſarie that we ſhould haue the word of God, that may teſtifie that the worke plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth God. For how can the conſcience offer a worke vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, vnleſſe there be a voice of God, which maie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that God will ſo be worſhipped or ſerued with this honour? But vngodlie men vnderſtanding this Doctrine of faith, haue in all ages with damnable boldnes deuiſed wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippes, without commaundement or word of God, which thing if it be lawfull to doe, you can ſhew no cauſe why the heatheniſh ſacrifices, ſlaing of dogges, ſacrifices of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered at Lampſacum to Priapus, &amp; ſuch like monſtrous wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſhould not pleaſe God. Whether hath mans foolehar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines ruſhed, not onelie amongſt the Ethnicks, in feigning worſhips, but alſo among the Popiſh rout in deuiſing eftſons new &amp; fooliſh ceremonies, in praier to the dead, in the worſhipping of ſaintes, and in the babling of Monkes. Here therefore let vs be watchfull, and not ſuffer lawes to be thruſt vpon the Churches, which preſcribe workes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:8251:257"/>
the commaundement of God, as Gods worſhippe and mans righteouſnes. And whereas all our aduerſaries, euen they that ſpeake moſte modeſtlie, doe tie this opinion of worſhippe vnto thoſe workes, let vs know, that it is a good worke to withſtand them, and by violating ſuch traditions to ſhew a patterne, by which the godlie may knowe what to iudge of them. As Euſebius writeth of Attalus, <hi>That he was commaunded by God to ſpeake vnto a certaine man which ate no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but bread, ſalte, and water, that he would vſe common meat, leſt he ſhould bring others into errour.</hi> Moreouer this ſecond errour which maketh theſe workes to be the worſhippe of God, brake farther. For manie in the Church were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued through a peruerſe emulation of the Leuiticall ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, and did thinke that there ſhould be ſome ſuch rites in the new Teſtament, and that they are the worſhipe of God, or things whereby God wil be honoured, yea &amp; that they are righteouſnes. And for that cauſe they gaue autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to the Biſhops to ordaine ſuch rites and ſuch ſeruices. This Phariſaicall errour Chriſt and his Apoſtles noted, who taught, that the worſhip of the new Teſtament is repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, the feare of God, faith, and the workes of the tenne commaundementes, as Paull ſaieth, <hi>The kingdome of God is not meate and drinke, but righteouſnes, and peace, and ioie in the holie Ghoſt. For he that in theſe ſerueth Chriſt, pleaſeth God, and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> approoued of men.</hi> The Monkes fained themſelues to be Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarites. The Maſſe Prieſtes that ſacrifice for the dead, would haue men think that they imitate Aaron offering ſacrifices. But theſe examples doe not agree: the rites of Monkes, and the Prieſts mercenary Maſſes, haue no word of god for them, yea there are manie fonde opinions mingled with them, which of neceſſitie muſt be reprooued in our Churches.</p>
                  <p>The third errour is the opinion of neceſſitie, wherein they imagine that the Church is like vnto other humane go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernmentes. For they ſurmiſe that it is a kingdome, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Biſhoppes, as if they were Kinges, haue power to make new lawes, that are beſides the Goſpell, and that they muſt of neceſſitie be obeied (euen as the Princes lawes muſt neceſſarilie be obeied) eſpeciallie ſeeing this life of man can not be without traditions. And this opinion of the neceſſitie of theſe things hath ſtirred vp contentions, whilſt
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:8251:257"/>
euerie one defendeth his owne rites inuented by man, as ſimply neceſſarie. But Chriſt and his Apoſtls teach, that ſuch rites ſet forth without Gods commaundement, are not to be taken for thinges neceſſarie. Againſt this libertie enacted and eſtabliſhed by Gods authoritie, the opinion which maintaineth that the violating of traditions about thinges indifferent, though it be not in a caſe where offence maie be giuen, is not to be receiued. Hetherto belongeth the ſaying of Paull, <hi>Let no man iudge you in meat and drinke, and entercourſe of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                  </p>
                  <p>Hitherto it hath bin ſhewed in what reſpect it is not lawful to appoint traditions, or to approoue them. Now ſome man may aske whether we would haue this life of man to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out order &amp; rites? No ſurelie. But we teach that the true Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors of the churches may ordein publike rites in their chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, but ſo, as it be onelie for an end belonging to the bodie, that is, for good orders ſake, to wit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſuch rites, as auaile for the inſtruction of the people: As for example, ſet daies, ſet leſſons, and ſuch like, and that without anie ſuperſtition, and opinion of neceſſitie, as hath bin ſaid before, ſo that it maie not be counted anie ſinne to violate anie of theſe ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſo it be not with giuing offence. But if ſo be that they be broken with offence there, where the Churches are well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and there is no error in doctrine, let him that in ſuch place breaketh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> know, that he doth offend, becauſe he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbeth the peace of the Church wel ordered, or doth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw others from the true miniſterie. This reaſon doth ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cientlie warrant the authority of profitable traditions, &amp; lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no ſnare on mens conſciences. So the Church in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of it, ordained ſet daies, as the Lords day, the daie of Chriſts natiuity, Eaſter, Pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ticoſt, &amp;c. Neither did the church diſpenſe with the moral precepts, but Gods owne authority abrogated the ceremonies of Moſes law. And yet it was meet that the people ſhould know when to come together to the hearing of the Goſpel, &amp; vnto the ceremonies which Chriſt did ordaine. And for that cauſe certain daies were appointed to that vſe, without anie ſuch opinions as were aboue men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:8251:258"/>
And the general equity abideth ſtil in the moral law, that at certeine times we ſhould come together to theſe god<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lie exerciſes: but the ſpeciall daie, which was but a ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, is free. Whereupon the Apoſtles retained not the ſeauenth daie, but did rather take the firſt daie of the weeke for that vſe, that by it they might admoniſh the godlie both of their libertie, and of Chriſtes reſurrection. <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 4. obſeruat.</note>The thinges obiected againſt this maie eaſelie be taken awaie. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles decree touching thinges offered to Idoles, and fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was moral, and perpetuall: but in that which they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, touching blood, and that which was ſtrangled, they had regard of offence giuing at that time. For it was an vſe euen before the Apoſtles time, that ſuch as then were conquered by the Iewes ſhould abſtaine from blood and thinges ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled. The Apoſtles therefore haue laied no new thing vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe, that were ioyned vnto their fellowſhippe, but as yet they kept the olde vſual rite, which was pleaſing both to the godlie Iewes, and ſuch as ioyned with them in the ſocietie of Chriſt. As for that which Chriſt ſaith, <hi>I haue yet manie things to ſay vnto you:</hi> doubtles he meant not thoſe foloiſh ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies that the Popes haue brought in, nor any new articles of faith, but a farther illumination of that goſpel, which he had already deliuered. And therfore afterward he addeth touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the office of the holy ghoſt, that he ſhould not bring any other kinde of doctrine, but ſhould enlighten the mindes of the Apoſtles, that they ſhould vnderſtand the Goſpel touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the will of God, which before had bin taught. Therefore he ſaieth; Ioan. 14. <hi>He ſhal teach you all thinges, and ſhal bring al things to your remembrance, which I haue ſhewed you.</hi> Againe, <hi>He ſhall not ſpeake of himſelfe, but what he hath heard, that ſhall he ſpeake.</hi>

<pb n="533" facs="tcp:8251:258"/>
Gods, like as manie haue aſcribed a godhead vnto Images: and manie, either of ſuperſtition, or by tyrannie, doe heap vp ceremonies: &amp; ſuperſtition hath increaſed in the Church the ceremonies of ſatisfaction, as they cal them. Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſar &amp; Antiochus, becauſe they are of opinion, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in Religion is auaileable to the peaceable gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their kingdomes, doe ordaine ſuch ſeruice of God, as they wil hane indifferentlie obſerued of all their ſubiects. There new lawes, and new Gods were erected, not of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, but by tyrannie. Thus we obſerue that amongſt men true and falſe religion are confounded, and each chaunged into other, and we maruell at the cauſe, why men doe not ſtedfaſtlie continue in the truth reuealed by God. But the worde of God pronounceth, that men are ſet on by Deuils to fall away from God: and the nature of man being blinde<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> curious, and inconſtant, loueth to plaie with diuers opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Againſt theſe great miſchiefs God armeth and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth his Church, and deliuereth a ſure and certaine do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which is conteyned in the bookes of the Prophets and Apoſtles, and in the Creedes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Wherefore it is neceſſary to conſider, what thoſe lawes, or rites be, and whence they had their beginning.</p>
               <p>The firſt rule therefore is this: It is lawfull for no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, neither for Angels, nor for men, neither for Kinges nor for <note n="*" place="margin">looke the 1. obſeruat. vpon this confeſſ.</note>Biſhops to make laws, or ordeine ceremonies, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeing from the worde of God. Horriblie ſinned the King of Babylon, although he excelled in wiſdome and valour, when he commaunded his Image to be worſhipped; and all men doe ſinne that obey ſuch proclamations or lawes: euen as Eue ſinned, when ſhee departed from the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, for the lying perſuaſion of the Deuill. But ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerallie the rule is to be obſerued, which is ſet downe. Act. 5. <hi>We ought rather to obey God then men.</hi> Such are the edicts, which commaund to call vpon dead men, or to imbrace falſe doctrine, or to vſe vngodlie worſhippe. Touching all theſe, that Rule of the firſt commaundement is to be hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, 1. Cor. 10. <hi>Flie from Idolls.</hi> Such is alſo the law of the ſingle life of Prieſts, which manie can not obſerue without ſinne. And albeit we know what opinion politique and expert men doe hold of the chaunge of lawes, yet God hath
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:8251:259"/>
ſo commaunded obedience, that ſtill he would haue vs faſt tied vnto himſelfe, and to agree with his wiſdome and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes. From whence doe ariſe thoſe vnchangeable and perpetuall rules, Exod. 20. <hi>Thou ſhalt haue no ſtrange Gods.</hi> Alſo, Acts 5. <hi>We ought rather to obey God then men.</hi> Alſo Gal. 1. <hi>If anie man teach you anie other Goſpell, let him be accurſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond rule. For aſmuch as it is vſuall to adde ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition to thoſe works, which otherwiſe in their owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture were indifferent, as to eate, or not to eate fleſh, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie to reprooue ſuch ſuperſtitions &amp; errours, as are in this ſorte added, and in the practiſe of our libertie, exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of this doctrine may modeſtlie be ſhewed. And that errour is not among the leaſt, which the follie of many teachers, and for the moſte parte of the people bringeth in, in that they teach and thinke that faſting and ſuch like workes deſerue forgiuenes of ſinnes, both of the guiltines, &amp; of the paine: as both <hi>Thomas</hi> doth write of ſatisfactions, and manie alſo doe ſaie the ſame. This Phariſaicall imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation eaſilie intangleth the mindes of men, and darkeneth the light of the doctrine of the benefits proper to Chriſt, and of free forgiuenes of ſinnes, and of faith. For when as men thinke that they merit remiſſion of ſinnes by theſe their ceremonies, they take awaie the honour due vnto Chriſt, and giue it vnto theſe ceremonies, and are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what puffed vp with vaine confidence. Yet afterward when they be in true ſorrow, they fal headlong into manie doubts, which turne to their deſtruction. And of it ſelfe it is a great ſinne, not to know the benefits of God. For this cauſe Paull ſo earneſtlie contendeth for the aboliſhing of circumciſion, and other ceremonies of the law of Moſes, for feare leſt the true acknowledgement of the Mediatour might be cleane put out, if men ſhould think that they deſerued remiſſion of ſinnes, and were made righteous by this obſeruation of the law and ceremonies of Moſes, as the Phariſies did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouch. And oftentimes Paull admoniſheth to beware that the light of the Goſpell be not darkened by new ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of mans inuention. This ſecond errour is not ſo eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, but yet verie daungerous. After that ſome men ſee that this Phariſaical errour can not be defended, they come to this: Although, ſay they, theſe ceremonies deſerue not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:8251:259"/>
of ſinnes, yet are theſe traditions defended, becauſe they are good workes and ſeruices of God: as in the law of Moſes the abſtinence of the Nazarites, although it deſerued not remiſſion of ſinnes, yet it pleaſed god, and was a ſeruice acceptable vnto God. With this colour certaine of late haue learned to paint traditions, which yet ſtriue not about theſe indifferent matters, but go about to eſtabliſh other foul errours, and the opinion of the power of Biſhops. But it is neceſſarie for the godlie here to beware of deceitfull do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. There is a great errour euen in this colourable rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: neither is that example well alledged out of Moſes. The workes ordeined and commaunded by God doe farre differ from workes not commaunded nor ordeined by God, but onely deuiſed by mans inuention. The works ordeined in the law of god, were ſeruices of god, although they deſerued forgiuenes of ſins. But wilworſhips deuiſed by men, neither haue bin, nor are any ſeruice of god<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God doth not alow this boldnes of men, which notwithſtanding hath alwaies been vſuall, to deuiſe new worſhip, that is, ſuch as is immediatlie intended to honour God withall. Therefore the worde of God crieth out, Math. 15. <hi>In vaine do they worſhip me after the ordinances of men.</hi> And euerie where in the Apoſtles, and in Paull, this boldnes is reprooued. But the true ſeruice of God are thoſe workes, that he hath commaunded, which are done in the acknowledgement and confidence of the Mediatour, to the end, that God maie be obeyed, and that we maie profeſſe him to be the true God, whome we ſo worſhip. So alſo Ezec. 20. he calleth vs back to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of God, ſaying: <hi>Walke not after the ordinances of your fathers, but walke in my commaundements.</hi> And often are ſuch warnings repeated, And Pſal. 118. <hi>Thy word is a lanterne vnto my feete.</hi> And Num. 15. <hi>Let them not follow their owne ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third errour is this. Hypocrites do imagine that ſuch workes are a kinde of perfection: as Monkes doe preferre their vowes ful of vanitie before the ciuill and houſeholders life: whereas God by his wonderfull prouidence hath ſo ioyned mankinde together in fellowſhippe, and in theſe tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels and daungers would haue our faith, praier, and confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or liberallity one toward an other, or patience, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:8251:260"/>
vertues, to be tried.</p>
               <p>The fourth errour is, the opinion of neceſſitie, as ſome doe write, That the faſting of Lent is neceſſarie, and other things are arbitrarie. Neither is it onelie a torment<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, to iudge that he is no Chriſtian nor member of the Church of God, that eateth fleſh on the Satursdaie, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth not the faſte of Lent; but it is alſo an errour that darkneth great matters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the doctrine of the righteouſnes of the Goſpell, and of the Church, what manner of Church it is, and how the members of the Church are to be diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, not by meate and drinke, but by faith, praier, and other vertues. And againſt the opinion of neceſſitie it is expreſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid, Col. 2. <hi>Let no man iudge you in meat or drinke.</hi> And Galat. 5. <hi>Stand in the libertie wherewith Christ hath made you free, and be not againe intangled with the yoke of bondage.</hi> And that opinion of neceſſitie hath alwaies breade great diſcord: as in time paſt there was great contention about Eaſter daie, &amp; about leuen, and now alſo many ſuch like contentions haue riſen.</p>
               <p>The fift errour. To the former opinions this errour alſo is added, that the Biſhops take to themſelues authoritie to ordaine new kindes of worſhipe, &amp; to binde conſciences, as Gregory hath ordeined, <hi>That maried men tranſlated to the order of prieſthoode ſhould forſake the companie of their wiues,</hi> and the conſtitution of confeſſion commaundeth to reckon vp ſins, and decrees haue beene made of differences of meates, and faſting, and ſuch like. Of ſuch traditions there are alſo late books ſetforth, full of labyrinths, wherin it is written, that the tranſgreſſions of ſuch ceremonies are mortall ſinnes, yea though they be committed without giuing offence to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Gerſon ſought for ſome mitigations, but the true com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort is the voice of the Goſpel, which would haue the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of this liberty to be made known and mainteined in the Church, namely by remoouing thoſe errours whereof hath beene ſpoken. But ceremonies inuented by man, ſuch as are ſeemelie, deuiſed for order, may be obſerued without any opinion of merit, worſhip, or neceſſitie, as hath beene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid out of the Col. 2. <hi>Let no man iudge you in meat or drinke.</hi> And Peter ſaith, Act. 15. <hi>Why doe ye tempt God laying vpon the neckes of the diſciples a yoke, which neither your fathers, nor we were able to beare.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="537" facs="tcp:8251:260"/>
The third rule. Thoſe errours beeing remooued, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Church muſt needes be admoniſhed, afterward we both obſerue certeine ceremonies, which are comelie, and made for good order, and alſo teach that they ought to be obſerued, euen as men can not liue without order. And Paull ſaieth, 1. Cor. 14. <hi>Let all things be done decentlie, and in order.</hi> And there is a ſaying of Athanaſius, <hi>Ceremonies are profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, but with knowledge of the trueth, and in meaſure.</hi> It is plaine, that this laſt word is opproſſed to ſuperſtition, which then alſo dailie increaſed ceremonies, and darkened the trueth, and burdened conſciences, and the Churches. But we thanke God the euerlaſting Father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, who for his Sonne, and by him gathereth an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Church, for that euen from the firſt beginning of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde he hath preſerued the publique miniſterie of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and honeſt aſſemblies, who himſelfe alſo hath ſet a part certeine times for the ſame: and we pray him that hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth he will ſaue and gouerne his Church. And we diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie teach, that al men ought to help to mainteine the publike miniſterie, &amp; auoid offences, &amp; diſſentions that ſcatter the Church, as in it proper place more at large is declared.</p>

But it is not lawfull for them to thruſt vpon the Church the ceremonies of the olde law for the holie ſeruice wherewithall God alone is worſhipped. Neither is it lawfull either to reſtore the olde ceremonies of the law, or to deuiſe new, to ſhadow forth the truth allreadie laide open, and brought to light by the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell: as in the daie light to ſet vp candles, to ſignifie the light of the Goſpel, or to carie banners and croſſes, to ſignifie the victorie of Chriſt through his croſſe.

Much leſſe is it lawfull to ordaine ceremonies, and holie rites, by the merit whereof ſinne may be purged &amp; the kingdome of heauen purchaſed. For of that former kind of ceremonies and holie rites, Chriſt out of Eſay preacheth, ſaying, <hi>In vaine, doe they worſhippe me, teaching for doctrines the precepts of men.</hi> And Paull ſaith, <hi>Let no man iudge you in meat, or drink, or part of an holie daie, or of the new Moone, &amp;c.</hi> Hitherto may be added the teſtimonies of Auguſtine &amp; others, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the obſeruation of ſuch ceremonies.

               <p>FVrthermore, touching the traditions of the Fathers or ſuch as the Biſhops and Churches doe at this daie ordaine, this is the opinion of our men. They reckon no tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dirions for mens traditions, but ſuch as are condemned in Scripture, but ſuch as are contrarie to the law of God, ſuch as binde the conſcience about me at, and drinke, and times, and other outward things, ſuch as forbid mariage to them who haue neede therof, to liue honeſtlie, and the reſt of that ſtamp.

for good manners &amp; the profit of men, although they be not word for worde expreſſed in the Scriptures, neuertheles in that they proccede from the commaundement of loue, which ordereth all things moſt decentlie, they are worthely to be accounted rather of God, then of man. Of this ſort were thoſe ſet downe by Paull, that women ſhould not praie <note place="margin">1. Cor. 14. 1. Cor. 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note>in the Church bareheaded, nor men with their heades co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, that they who are to communicate together ſhould tary one for another: that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould ſpeak with tongues in the congregation without an interpreter: that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets without confuſion ſhould deliuer their Prophecies to be iudged by them that ſit by.

But he that ſhall ſeeke nothing of his owne, but ſhall wholly dedicate himſelfe to the publike profit, he ſhal eaſily ſee, what things are agreable to the law of god, what are not. Furthermore, ſeing the eſtate of Chriſtians is ſuch, that they are alſo helped by iniuries, the Chriſtian will not refuſe to obey, no not vniuſt lawes, ſo they haue no wicked thing in them, according to the ſaying of Chriſt, <hi>If any man compell thee to goe with him one mile, go with him two.</hi> Euen ſo ſurelie the Chriſtian ought to become all vnto al, that he may ſtudie to do and ſuffer all things, ſo that they be not contrarie to the commaundements of God, to pleaſure and profit men withall.

                  <p>In the ſecond place they teach that this gift is not of fleſh and blood (for the Lord by diſtinguiſhing doth remooue and ſeperate from hence that vnablenes which is in this kinde) but of the ſpirit which is ielous, who from his heart hath a care and pleaſure in the glorie of God, and in his owne and his neighbours ſaluation, and alſo in the Miniſterie of the Church, and for this cauſe he doth of his owne accord ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteine from wedlock: Therefore the Lord ſaith, <hi>Thoſe which</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 19.</note>
                     <hi>haue made them-ſelues Eunuches for the kingdome of heauen:</hi> that is, who be ſuch, as might be maried, yet they do omit and abſteine from it, becauſe of the affection of the inward heart and their loue toward God, and his word, and for the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and ioy which they receiue thereof: and through this gift of the ſpirit, whoſe vertue and power doth ouercome the motions of nature, they do preſerue the purenes as well <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 3. obſeru.</note>of the ſpirit, as of the bodie: howbeit this thing is not in them without labour and difficulty, euen as it is a thing of no ſmall labour and difficultie for all Chriſtian men to forſake, and to want the vſe of other pleaſant things, and alſo ſuch as are profitable for this life, as friendes, riches, and monie.</p>
                  <p>Thirdlie, that ſingle life is to be choſen, and taken with a true intent and a godlie meaning, that is, not to this end, or with this purpoſe, that a man would by this meanes me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit or get vnto himſelfe, or to another, remiſſion of ſinnes, and eternall life, and ſo conſequentlie ſaluation it ſelfe. For ther is no continencie or chaſtitie, nor anie humane action, or other vertue, which can merit: the onelie innocencie and death of the onely begotten Sonne of God our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt doth performe and perfit this thing. Neither muſt the thing be receiued with this meaning, as to think that ſome dignitie is added to the holie miniſterie of the Church by reaſon of this gift: or that the workes of thoſe that be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maried in this miniſterie, are to be preferred in merit and

dignitie before the works of married men: but as the Lord ſaith, <hi>that it maie be receiued for the kingdome of heauen:</hi> that is, in ſuch ſort, as he which for the gift ſpoken of before, is fit to lead a ſingle life.</p>
                  <p>As therefore by theſe things he may with leſſe hindrance and more eaſily, and readilie with great leaſure, and more commodiouſlie imploy his labour to the ſaluation of the Church and holy aſſemblies, euen ſo he may be a more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient miniſter then others, of the ſame ſaluation, which Chriſt hath purchaſed for him: (and whereof that he may be partaker by faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is giuen him freelie of grace, and wherein he doth keepe and vpholde him ſelfe) ſeeing that it is certeine, that by the ſtate of marriage many lets, manie cares, and manie thinges whereby neceſſary quietnes is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed, are caſt in our way. And this is it which Paul ſaith, <hi>I would that you ſhould be without ſuch cares. He that is vnmarried, is</hi>

And before we rehearſed the voice of the Lord who ſaith, <hi>that there be ſome, who for the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen, do abſtaine from marriage.</hi> And holy Paull ſaith, <hi>He that giueth not his virgine to be married, doth the better.</hi> For which cauſe it is taught, that all they, who of their owne accord do take and chuſe vnto themſelues this kinde of life, ought carefully to haue regard hereunto, that in ſuch a life they may with a ſingular &amp; earneſt endeauour exerciſe god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, and be holie, as Paull commaundeth, as well in body, as in ſpirit, and giue more light then others, by the hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie of their actions, by the laboures of ſuch trades as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeme a Chriſtian profeſſion, by doing all that they can for the benefit of the Church, and by yeelding their ſeruice to the ſicke, and to other needy members.</p>
                  <p>This gift and purpoſe of ſuch which do thus in this matter conſecrate themſelues to God, and ſuch an exerciſe of their godlines, is commended of our men, and they do faithfully perſuade men hereunto: but they do perſuade, as we ſaid, and not compell: the which thing Paull alſo doth, who wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth <note place="margin">1.

Yet notwithſtanding if anie good, faithful, and diligent man chaunce to be aſſaulted with ſuch a tentation, as to feare in himſelfe the heat and wicked fact of luſte, then there is no ſnare laid for ſuch a one, neither is there anie daunger of entrapping his conſcience, but he that is in this caſe, let him be put ouer <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 4. obſeru.</note>to take counſell of the Elders, and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the Church, who haue the ſpirit of God, that all may be done in the Church in order, decentlie, with hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie of the example, and with the vſing of all due conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Then verilie, if vpon theſe thinges thus done, he doth lawfullie chaunge his kinde of life, he doth not ſinne, ſeeing that he obeyeth the counſell of the holie Ghoſt: and the holie Church ought not for this cauſe to contemne him, nor to make anie thing the leſſe account of his miniſterie. Notwithſtanding, if for this cauſe he ſhould be contemned, which the Church can not do without ſinne, it were certeinly better for him, by this meanes to preſerue his ſoule, (although he ſhould be one of the common ſort of Chriſtians onely) then by perſiſting in his miniſterie with ſinne, to looſe and condemne it.</p>
                  <p>But although it ſeemeth to come neerer to the example of the Primitiue Church, that worthie and honeſt maried men may be choſen to take the charge of ſoules in the Church, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to giue them leaue to change their kinde of life, who before

After theſe thinges they doe thus conſequentlie teach touching wedlocke, that ſuch a condition of life, though it haue many difficulties, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, and curſes ioyned with it, wherewith after the fall of man, both mankinde<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and this order is opreſſed, yet that it is in this wiſe holie, and acceptable vnto God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that God himſelfe did in the beginning ordaine it, and afterward Chriſt our Lord did confeciate it, and doth daily conſecrate it in thoſe that are his, and that in ſuch ſort, that their children alſo be holie, and that moreouer God hath offered vnto it peculiarlie ſingular promiſes, and bleſſings, which are conteined in the Scriptures. Thence therefore muſt al true Chriſtians know, that whoſoeuer doe chuſe this kinde of life ſo as it becommeth them, and with an vpright purpoſe doe both giue them ſelues thereunto, and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſant therein, they doe not onelie not ſinne, but they doe, and accompliſh that, which God would haue them to doe: and that they lead ſuch a kinde of life, as God doth peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arlie call ſome vnto, and that they doe ſerue the ſelfe ſame Lord, whome the vnmaried men doe ſerue.</p>

<pb n="549" facs="tcp:8251:266"/>
the matter it ſelfe doth teſtifie how much beaſt lines, &amp; how manie vilanies this popiſh law of ſingle life doth bring forth: no voice of man is able to ſhew, how manie vices haue iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forth of this fountaine into the Church. For (to ſaie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Epicures, whoe bluſh at nothing) how manie good and godlie men haue had all ſucceſſe in ſtriuing with their natural weaknes, and at the laſt haue fallen into horrible diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire? Now wherto tendeth this new crueltie, but that thoſe innumerable vilanies might be confirmed in the Churches, and that wicked men might ſinne more freelie? This mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter needeth no diſputation at all. For this now law defended by our aduerſaries, which forbideth Prieſtes to marie, and diſſolueth thoſe that are contracted, is flat contrarie to the lawe of nature, to the lawe of god, to the Goſpell, to the conſtitutions of auncient ſynods, and to the examples of the auncient Church. Onelie in this calling we need the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines and equitie of the moſte excellent Emperour, whome we beſeech for his godlines and dueties ſake that he would ſeeke ſome remedie for the Church by aboliſhing this tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall law. For as all vniuſt crueltie doth diſpleaſe God, ſo that moſte of all, which is exerciſed againſt godlie and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Prieſtes, which deſerue well of the Church.</p>
                  <p>And in this caſe we haue not onelie the worde of God threatning moſte greeuous plagues againſt them, which exerciſe crueltie on the Prieſtes, but alſo there are exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to be ſeen in al ages which do plainely teſtifie, that ſuch threatnings are not in vaine. For to let poſſe infinit other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, the Tribe of Benjamin was almoſt quite deſtroied, for abuſing the Prieſtes wife that came thither as a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. For when as the dead bodie of the woman, which died after ſhee had beene ſo abuſed, was cut in peeces, and ſent to all the Princes of Iſraell, all the people iudged that ſuch outrage ought moſte ſeuerelie to be reuenged. And when they could not get the authors of this ſhameful fact to be deliuered vnto them, for to be puniſhed, the wholl Tribe of Beniamin receiuing a great ouerthrowe, was puniſhed for it. Now in theſe daies the Prieſtes are vexed with ſundrie iniuries: they are (when no other crime is obiected vnto them but mariage) racked with moſte horrible tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſo put to death, their miſerable wiues and litle

children, being throwne out of houſe and home, wander vp and downe, as baniſhed perſons, without anie certaine place of abode, or houſe to dwell in. Paull calleth <hi>The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding of mariage the Doctrine of Deuilles:</hi> which to be true, not onelie theſe filthie vices, which the ſingle life hath brought into the Church, but alſo the crueltie, which by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this lawe is exerciſed vpon Prieſtes, and their wiue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But the deuiſers of ſuch counſell ſhall one day haue their iuſt reward from God. We iudge that ſuch crueltie is not worthie for Chriſtians to vſe, nor profitable to the Church of God.</p>
                  <p>Whereas they obiect the authoritie of the Popes lawe, whie doe they not alledge the authoritie of the Canons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe ſhamefull examples of vncleane ſingle life, and thoſe vilanies, that were worthie of moſte ſeuere puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? The authoritie of the Popes decree, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the lawe of nature, and the commaundement of God, ſhould be of no waight. Men are ſo made by nature, that they ſhould be fruitfull. Whereupon the lawiers ſaie, <hi>That the coniunction of man &amp; woman is by the law of nature.</hi> And the ſame the firſt book of Moſes teacheth in the firſt &amp; ſecond Chapters. Againe, when Saint Paull ſaith, <hi>To auoide forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, let euerie man haue his wife,</hi> it is certaine, that he bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth all which are not apt for a ſingle life, to ioyne in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. And Chriſt doth admoniſh, that all are not fit for a ſingle life, when he ſaieth, <hi>All men doe not reeeiue this thing.</hi> Moreouer, neither mens lawes, nor anie vowes, are of force, which are againſt the commaundement of God. And the euent it ſelfe doth teſtifie, that nature cannot be chaunged by mans lawe. For we ſee what vile filthines this ſingle life doth bring forth, and if there be anie honeſt men which endeuour to keepe themſelues chaſte, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue right wel how great a burden, how great daunger there is in this thing, and they doe eſpecia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Certaine men went about in the Nicen Synod to make a lawe to forbid Prieſtes the vſe of their wiues. This law was refuſed by the holie Synod: and the Latine Churches in the
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:8251:267"/>
olde time was not ſo ſeuere in this pointe: for they did put from the miniſterie onelie ſuch, as when they had taken vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them anie Eccleſiaſtical function, did afterwards marrie wiues, yet they did not forbid mariage. But this is a new law of the Pope, vnknowne to the auncient Churches and Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods, which doth whollie forbidde mariages, and brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of ſuch as are contracted. But it is euident, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of this decree is flat contrarie to the Goſpell. They alledge againſt vs the authoritie of the Church, and of ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodes, which the Popes them ſelues that were authors of this decree, did impudentlie contemne, and godlie Prieſtes did euidentlie withſtand this new lawe. For the Eccleſiaſticall hiſtories doe teſtifie, that it was neuer laied vpon the Churches, without great contentions and reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. The Biſhoppe of Tarracon writeth to Syricius the Pope, <hi>That the Prieſtes of Spaine could not be brought to admit that lawe which for bad them the vſe of their wiues.</hi> What a ſtirre doth Syricius keepe there? How ſharpelie doth he write? For theſe are the wordes of Syricius, which are vnmeete for a Pope: <hi>Let him tell me, whoſoeuer he be, a hunter after luſtes, and a Maſter of vices.</hi> And thereupon he wreſteth the words of S. Paull to his cauſe, which are moſt farre from it: <hi>They which liue in the fleſh can not pleaſe god.</hi> A man may doubt ſuerelie, whether it maie better be attributed to his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or his impudencie, that he ſpeaketh ſo diſdainefully of mariage. For he goeth about nothing elſe but to forbidde Prieſtes the vſe of their wiues, which then they had maried.</p>
                  <p>But the Popes that ſucceeded after were yet more harde and cruell. When the Archbiſhop of Mentz did in a Synode rehearſe the Popes decree touching the putting awaie of wiues in Germanie, the Prieſtes were ſo kindled in their anger that they threatned to ſet vpon the Archbiſhoppe himſelfe. And it was in deed both an vnworthie, and cruell thing, to put awaie their wiues, which they then had But at laſt either force, or ſuperſtition got the vpper hand. <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> was farre more equall and gentle to ſuch women as had not kept their vowed chaſtitie. For he writeth in the firſt booke, the 11.

                     <hi>the breethren or ſiſters.</hi> Beſides this, vniuſt lawes are not wonte to be perpetuall. Wee doe therefore intreat the moſte excellent Emperour, that among manie other e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normities of the Church, he will alſo conſider the faultes of this law: in which caſe that alſo is to be weighed. The nature of man doeth as it were waxe olde, and is become weaker. Wherefore there muſt be care had that vices doe not increaſe: Neither muſt the lawes themſelues be ſeedes of vices. Plato ſaith verie wiſelie, that <hi>Lawes muſt be made for vertues ſake.</hi> Now whether this tradition of ſingle life be mainteined for pieties ſake, or for ſome other purpoſe, it is no hard matter to determine. Laſt of all, ſeeing that Chriſt hath eſpeciallie commended the care of the miniſters of the Goſpell to the godlie, wee deſire therefore that the moſte excellent Emperour would reſtraine this crueltie, which hath a long time bin exerciſed vpon godlie Prieſtes, and would rather conſult with the Church, then with our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries, in that behalfe. Surelie loue and mercifull dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſhould floriſh in the Church. Wherfore the true church doth greatlie abhorre vnneceſſarie crueltie, and would not haue the Prieſtes put to death for a tyrannicall tradition. She would alſo haue the poore Wiues &amp; Children of Prieſts fauourablie dealt with. All whoſe liues &amp; ſaftie the Church doth commend vnto thee, O moſt mercifull Emperour. All the godlie whereſoeuer, are touched with their miſeries &amp; doe in heart deſire Chriſtian lenitie in this behalfe, and doe alſo with teares iointlie commend learned and honeſt men that are profitable to the Church together wth their wiues and children, vnto thee, whome they ſe both to be indued with an excellent and heroi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The Church would not haue thee to be a miniſter of another mans cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie. The greateſt honour of Kings is that which Eſaie gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth to them when he ſaith, that <hi>they ſhould be nurſe fathers to the Church:</hi> that is, that kingdomes and the maintenance of peace and of humane ſociety ſhould not onlie ſerue for the profit of the bodie, but alſo ſhould further the goſpel, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie when as they both rule the Prieſts, and alſo graunt peace

&amp; quietnes to Cities, that the youth might be trained vp in religion, and men might be inſtructed. The Church there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth beſeech thee to remember that the care of defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the godlie Prieſts, as of certeine nourſlings, lieth vpon thee. It belongeth vnto this calling to be a ſuccour for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie, to ſaue from iniuries, eſpecially ſuch as are weake, which are not able to defend themſelues, as namelie godlie women, children, and orphanes or the fatherles. Among which you maie well thinke that the wiues and children of Prieſts, which are right orphanes in deed, are left vnto your charge by the Lorde. The Church, as moſte full of naturall affection and loue, doth not onelie approoue of the mutuall loue of maried folkes one to another, and of the loue of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents to their children, but is alſo touched with the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of thoſe that are forlorne and fatherles. And ſurelie ſhee iudgeth in ſo great goodnes of your nature that there is no inhumanitie or want of naturall affection. VVherefore ſhee is in good hope that the murders, and executions of Prieſts, and the baniſhment of their wiues and children doe grieue thee not a litle. The Church alſo doth giue thee war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to looke to it, leſt manie points of Chriſtian doctrine, the vnfolding and laying open whereof is verie neceſſarie, be ſmothered vp, whiles godlie and learned miniſters are put to death, and whiles men are driuen from the ſtudie of Chriſtian doctrine. VVhat elſe do our aduerſaries ſeeke, but that all good learning &amp; true doctrine may be rooted out or oppreſſed, &amp; men maie onlie depend vpon the authoritie of ſuch as do bear rule, &amp; that they might eſteem the dreams of vnlearned men, though neuer ſo impious, neuer ſo abſurd, for oracles. Our aduerſaries imagine that this barbarous bondage is the beſt, and ſureſt for their Lordlie rule. And in deed it is verie euident, how the Church in manie places i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Now though libertie maie not be graunted to diſanull ſuch determinations, as be receiued by good authoritie, and though men ought not to depart either from the ſcriptures, or from the decrees of the ancient Synods, wherin they haue determined of Chriſtian doctrine, yet is it not meet that the authority of the church ſhould be pretended for all ſuch abuſes and faultes, as the latter and worſer age hath brought into the Church. And
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:8251:269"/>
ſurelie men doe flatter and deceiue themſelues too much, if they think that there be no faults conueied into the church by the deſires of couetous men, and by thoſe Laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthes &amp; obſcurities, of the doctrine and traditions of the ſchoolemen. For now a daies good men are not ſo much in daunger for their marriage ſake, as for their care and deſire they haue to purge and bring to trial the doctrine of Chriſt. Which care the Biſhops ought wiſelie to direct and further. For to them eſpeciallie is the care of ſetting forth the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of true doctrine commended: they ſhoulde be the ringleaders and furtherers of this moſte holie and ftuitfull care and ſtudie. But it belongeth not to the Biſhop alone but alſo to godlie Princes, and eſpeciallie to the Emperour, to vnderſtand the goſpell purely, to iudge of opinions, to be warre and watchfull that no wicked opinions be receiued or roo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Wherefore you muſt thinke it your duety alſo to take heed, leſt ſuch thinges, as be godly and profitablie brought to light and reformed by God and learned men, be ſmothered againe, and leſt that wicked abuſes be eſtabliſhed by your authoritie.

                  <p>Laſt of all, ſeeing that humane traditions ought to giue place to times and opportunities, eſpeciallie in the Church, wherein there ſhould be more regard had of the ſaluation of the godlie, and of loue, and publique peace, then of anie

humane traditions, it were a great deale better to make ſhew of abrogating this ſeelie tradition of ſingle life, then to ſtrengthen luſts, to diſſolue mariages, to exerciſe crueltie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Prieſts and their wiues and children, to oppreſſe true and holie doctrine, and to make hauock of the Church. We doe therefore commend this matter of their mariage vnto your pietie and bountie, O noble Emperour, as that which hath no difficultie or doubt fulnes in it. For they that be gouernours both maie and ought to aboliſh an vniuſt lawe. And the lawes of ſingle life, whether they be new, or olde, belong onlie to humane equity, in mitigating whereof the authoritie of the Church ſhould be of great force. VVee could bring verie manie examples out of the hiſtories of all times and countries, in which there might be ſeene horrible examples of iudgements, which followed vpon vncleane luſts. Among manie other cauſes of the general flood, there is mention made of fleſhlie luſts.

After this Dauid was driuen out of his kingdome for adulterie. And Ieremie in diuers places crieth out, that theſe three, Idolatrie, oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and adulteries, are the cauſes of thoſe great calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which ouerwhelmed the wholl nation of the Iewes then, when they were carried captiues to Babylon. Theſe thinges are written for this purpoſe, that wee might know certainelie that God is diſpleaſed with wandring luſtes of vncleannes: and that vncleane and inceſtuous perſons doe not fall into puniſhments by chaunce, but are puniſhed of God. Therefore the deſtructions of heathniſh Cities alſo doe put vs in minde of the wrath of God againſt theſe villanies, <hi>Sibaris</hi> was ouerthrowne: <hi>Athens, Sparta,</hi> and <hi>Thebes,</hi> being toſſed with ciuill warres, receiued due puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

of their filthines. And Rome when it brought forth manie <hi>Neroes</hi> and <hi>Heliogabales,</hi> at length it came to ruine, the Empire being rent into ſundrie partes by the warres of ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie barbarous nations. There is alſo a long Catalogue in Ariſtotle of Cities, wherein there happened chaunges of gouernment and ſeditions, for vncleane luſtes. Beſides all which puniſhments Paul warneth the church that there is another iudgement that followeth vpon theſe luſtes, and that is madnes, or furie, as it is written. Rom. 1. and Epheſians 4. And it maie well be, that this iudgement hath ſeaſed vpon our Eccleſiaſticall gouernours, whoe for the moſte parte are open Epicures, open defenders of Idolls, that they may get welth and authoritie, and ſcoffe at thoſe heauenlie ſayings, which threaten vengeance vpon Idolaters, vncleane perſons, and Parricides. They vaunte that they doe all thinges well, which they doe for their king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes ſake, and that ſuch are good ſubiects, and loue quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and peace, that allow of errours and open naughtines, that they maie vphold the maieſtie of the Popes kingdome. The wholl world can beare witnes that there is a God that doth reuenge all filthines, vncleannes, and oppreſſion. Wherefore though they now deride and ſcoffe at theſe ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, yet let them know, that they ſhall one daie ſtick faſt in thoſe puniſhments, whereunto the world it ſelfe doth call them.</p>
                  <p>Seeing then it is a cleare caſe, that the law of ſingle life is directlie againſt the commaundement of God, we thinke that the Prieſtes and others doe verie well, which ioyne in honeſt marriage, as Paull ſaith, that <hi>a Biſhoppe muſt be choſen that is the husband of one wife.</hi> We iudge alſo that the rulers both may, and ought to aboliſh this law of the Pope. For they are foulie deceiued, that thinke either that marriage is forbidden to prieſts by Gods law, or elſe that the Kinges or the Biſhops may make a law to forbid them marriage. And if that rulers will not helpe the Church in this behalfe, yet the godlie doe well which follow the Apoſtles rule, which ſaith, <hi>That we must rather obey God, then men.</hi> To conclude, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the defenſe of the Popes lawe hath many faultes ioyned with it, as namelie the ſtrengthning of wandring luſts, ſuperſtitions, and murdering of godlie Prieſts, euerie

For no lawe of man, no vowe can take away the commaundement of god and his ordinance. By theſe reaſons our Prieſts doe prooue that they maie lawfully marrie wiues. And it is wel knowne, that in the auncient Churches Prieſts were married.

It is verie like that if mariage be forbidden a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny longer, we ſhall at length want Paſtours in the Church. Seing then that there is a plaine commaundement of God, ſeeing the vſe of the Church is well knowne, ſeing that the impure ſingle life bringeth forth verie many offences, adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, and other enormities worthie to be puniſhed by the godlie magiſtrate, yet it is a maruell, that greater crueltie ſhould be ſhewed in no other thing, then againſt the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of Prieſts. God hath commaunded to honour marriage: the lawes in all well ordered common welthes, euen among the heathen alſo haue adorned marriages with verie great priuileges. But now men are cruellie put to death, yea and Prieſts alſo, contrarie to the minde of the Canons, for no other cauſe, but onelie for marriage. Paul calleth that <hi>a doctrine of Diuells</hi> which forbiddeth mariage. 1. Tim. 4. which may now verie well be ſeene, when as the forbidding of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage is mainteined by ſuch puniſhments. But as no law of man can take awaie the law of God, no more can anie vow whatſoeuer. Therfore <hi>Cyprian</hi> giueth counſel, that thoſe wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſhould marry, which do not keep their vowed chaſtity. His words are theſe in the firſt book, the 11.

In any wiſe let them giue no offence to their brethren or ſiſters.</hi> Yea and the Canons vſe a kinde of equitie towards ſuch, as before their ripe yeares did vowe chaſtitie, as hitherto the vſe hath beene.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Of the vowes of Monkes.</head>
                  <p>WHat is taught amongeſt vs, touching the vowes of Monkes ſhall be better vnderſtoode, if you call to minde what was the ſtate of Monaſtaries, and how many thinges were euerie daie committed in the Monaſteries, contrarie to the Cannons. In Auguſtines time Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges were free, but afterward, when diſcipline was cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, euerie where vowes were laid vpon them, that as it were by a new deuiſed priſon, the diſcipline might be reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red againe. Ouer and beſides vowes by litle and litle many other obſeruations were added. And theſe bands and ſnares were caſt vpon many, before they came to ripe yeares, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the Canons. Many through errour fell into this kinde of life vnawares, who though they wanted no yeares, yet they wanted diſcretion to iudge of their ſtrength and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie. They which were once got within theſe ſnares, were conſtrained to abide in them, though by the benefit of the Canon, ſome might be ſet at libertie. And that fell out rather in the Nonneries, then in the Colleges of Monks, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the weaker ſexe was more to be ſpared. This rigour &amp; ſeuerity miſliked many good men hertofore, when they ſaw young maides and young men thruſt vp into Monaſteries, there to get their liuing, and ſaw what an vnhappie ſucceſſe this counſell had, what offences it bred, and what ſnares it laide vpon mens conſciences. They were grieued that the authoritie of the Canons was wholly neglected and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in a thing moſt dangerous. To all theſe euills there was added, ſuch a perſwaſion of vowes, which as it is well knowen, did in former times miſlike the Monks themſelues, if any of them were ſomewhat ſtouter then the reſt. They taught forſooth that vows were equal to B aptiſme: touching ſingle life, they taught that it merited remiſſion of ſinnes, &amp; iuſtification before God: yea farther, that the Monkes life did not onelie merit righteouſnes before God, but more then that, becauſe it obſerued, not onelie the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but alſo the Counſells in the Goſpell. And thus they taught, that the Monkes profeſſion was better then
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:8251:272"/>
Baptiſme, that the Monkes life did merit more, then the life of Magiſtrates, of Paſtours, and ſuch like, which in the obedience of Gods commaundement followed their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, without any ſuch religion of mans making. None of theſe things can be denied, they are to be ſeene in their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings. What fell out afterwarde in the Monaſteries? In olde time there were Schooles for the ſtudie of Diuinitie, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther artes, which were profitable to the Church, and thence were Paſtours and Biſhops taken. But now the caſe is alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. It is needeles to rehearſe their vowes. In olde time they came together into ſuch places to learne, but now they feigne, that it is a kinde of life taken vp to merit remiſſion of ſinnes and iuſtification: yea they ſay, it is a ſtate of perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and preferre it to all other kinde of lifes that God ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. We haue therefore mentioned theſe things, amplify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing odiouſlie, to the end that the doctrine of our men touching this matter might be vnderſtood.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, touching ſuch as ioyne in mariage, thus they teach with vs, that it is lawfull for any to marrie, that is not fit for a ſingle life: foraſmuch as vowes can not take away Gods ordinance &amp; commaundement. The commaundement of God is, <hi>To auoide fornication, let euerie man haue his wife.</hi> And not onelie the commaundement, but alſo the creation and ordinance of God, compelleth ſuch vnto marriage, as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſpeciall worke of God are not exempted, according to that ſaying, <hi>It is not good <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>or man to be alone.</hi> They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that are obedient to this commaundement and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God doe not offend. What can be ſaide againſt theſe thinges? Let a man amplifie the bonde of a vow, as much as he will, yet can he neuer bring to paſſe that the vow ſhall take away Gods commaundement. The Canons teach, <hi>That in euery vow the right of the ſuperiou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> is excepted:</hi> much leſſe therefore can theſe vowes, which are contrarie to Gods commaundement, be of force. If ſo be that the bond of vowes had no cauſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> why it might be changed, then ſhould not the Romane Biſhops haue diſpenſed therewith. For in deede it is not lawfull for man to diſanull that bond, which doth ſimplie belong to the law of God. But the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Biſhops haue iudged verie wiſelie, that in this bond there muſt an equitie be vſed: therefore they are often read
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:8251:272"/>
to haue diſpenſed with vowes. The hiſtorie of the King of Arragon, beeing called backe out of a Monaſterie, is well knowne, and there be many examples of our time.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, why do our aduerſaries exaggerate the bond, or the effect of the vow, when as in the meane time they ſpeake not a word of the very nature of a vow, which ought to be in a thing poſſible, which ought to be voluntarie, and taken vp of a mans owne accorde, and with aduiſe or deliberation. But it is not vnkowne, how perpetuall chaſtitie is in the power of a man. And how many amongſt them is there, that doth vowe of his owne accord, and with aduiſe? Wenches &amp; young maides, before they know how to iudge, are perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, yea ſometimes alſo compelled to vow; wherfore it is not meete to diſpute ſo rigorouſlie of the bond, ſeeing that all men confeſſe, that it is againſt the nature of a vowe, which is not done of a mans owne <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ccord, or vnaduiſedlie. The ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons for the moſt part doe diſanull vowes, <hi>which are made b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore one be</hi> 15. <hi>yeares of age, becauſe that before one come to that age, he ſeemeth not to haue ſo much iudgement, as to determine of a perpetuall life.</hi> Another Canon permitting more to the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of men, doth adde ſome yeares moe, <hi>for it forbiddeth a vow to be made, before one be</hi> 18. <hi>yeares of age.</hi> But whether of theſe ſhall we follow? the greateſt parte hath this excuſe, why they forſake Monaſteries, becauſe that for the moſte parte they vowed before they came to this age.</p>
                  <p>Laſt of all, although the breaking of a vowe may be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, yet it followeth not, that the mariages of ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are to be diſſolued. For Auguſtine in his 27. queſt. 1. Cap. of Mariages, <hi>doth denie that they ought to be diſſolued:</hi> and his authoritie is not lightly to be eſteemed, although others afterward haue thought otherwiſe. And although the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of God, touching wedlocke, doth free moſte men from vowes, yet our men doe alſo bring another reaſon concerning vowes, that they be fruſtrate, becauſe that al the worſhip of God, inſtituted of men without the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, and choſen to merit remiſſion of ſinnes and iuſtification, is wicked, as Chriſt ſaith: <hi>They doe in vaine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip me with the commaundements of men.</hi> And Paull doth eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie where teach, that righteouſnes is not to be ſought, out of our obſeruations, and thoſe worſhips, which are deuiſed by
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:8251:273"/>
men, but that it commeth by faith to thoſe that beleeue that they haue God pacified and reconciled to them for Chriſt, not for any of their merits. But it is euident, that the Monkes did teach, <hi>that theſe made or counterfeited religions doe deſerue remiſſion of ſinnes and iuſtification, and that they doe ſatisfie for ſinnes.</hi> What els is this, then to detract from the glorie of Chriſt, and to obſcure, and denie the righteouſnes of faith? wherefore it followeth, that theſe vowes thus vſed were wicked worſhips, and therefore they be of no value. For a wicked vowe, and that which is made againſt the commaundement of God is of no force, <hi>neither ought a vowe to be a bond of iniquitie,</hi> as the Canon ſaith. Paul ſaith, <hi>Ye are made voide of Chriſt, which ſeeke to be iuſtified by the law, ye are fallen from grace:</hi> that is, they which doe thinke, that by their owne workes they doe merit remiſſion of ſinnes, and that they doe pleaſe God, for their owne fulfilling of the law, and doe not perceiue, that for Chriſt his ſake they doe freelie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue by faith remiſſion of their ſinnes, through the mercie of God, and that they doe pleaſe God through Chriſt, they doe looſe Chriſt, becauſe they do transferre the confidence which is due to Chriſt, and to the promiſe of God vnto workes. Alſo they oppoſe to the wrath of God, not Chriſt the propitiatour, but their owne workes, therefore they doe transferre the honour, which is due vnto Chriſt, vnto our workes. Now it is manifeſt, that the Monkes doe teach this, that by their obſeruations they doe deſerue remiſſion of ſinnes, becauſe they finde God merciful vnto them for theſe obſeruations. Wherefore they teach men to truſt to their owne workes, not to the propitiation of Chriſt. This is a wicked confidence, and is contrarie to the Goſpell, and in the iudgement of God it ſhall be ſound to be vaine. For our workes can not be oppoſed to the wrath and iudgement of God: the wrath of God is then onelie appeaſed, when as we doe by faith laie holde vpon the free mercie, promiſed for Chriſts ſake. Therefore they looſe Chriſt, which place their confidence, not in Chriſt, but in their owne workes.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer the Monks haue taught, that their kinde of life is a ſtate of perfection, becauſe they did obſerue not onely the commaundements, but alſo the counſells. This error is chiefelie contrarie to the goſpel, becauſe they haue feigned
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:8251:273"/>
that they do ſo ſatisfie the commaundements, as that they can alſo do ſomwhat more: &amp; hereupon aroſe that horrible errorwhich they haue feigned, that they had merits of ſuper erogation. Theſe they haue applied for others, that they might be ſatisfactions for other mens ſinnes. If anie man wil odiouſlie exaggerate theſe thinges, how many things might herehearſe, whereof the Monks themſelues are now aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med? It is no light offence, in the Church to propound vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the people a certein worſhip deuiſed by men, without the commaundement of God, and to teach, that ſuch a worſhip doth iuſtifie men: becauſe that the righteouſnes of faith in Chriſt, which ought eſpeciallie to be taught in the Church, is obſcured, when as thoſe maruelous religions of Angells, feigning of pouerty, and humilitie, and of ſingle life, are caſt before mens eies. Moreouer the commaundements of God and the true worſhip of God are obſcured, when as men do heare, that Monks alone are in that ſtate of perfection: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that Chriſtian perfection is this, to feare God ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and againe to conceiue great faith, and to truſt aſſuredlie, that God is pacified toward vs for Chriſt his ſake, to ask, and certainly to look for help from God in al our affaires, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our calling: and outwardlie to do good workes dilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentlie, and to tend vpon our vocation. In theſe things doth true perfection and the true worſhip of God conſiſt: it doth not conſiſt in ſinglenes of life, in beggarie, or in vile apparell.</p>
                  <p>The people alſo doth conceiue many pernitious opinions of thoſe falſe commendations of the monaſticall life. They heare that ſingle life is praiſed aboue meaſure, therefore they liue in marriage with offence of conſcience. They heare that beggers onelie are perfect, therefore they keepe their poſſeſſions, &amp; buy and ſell, with offence of conſcience. They heare that the goſpel giueth counſell, not to reuenge: therfore ſome that lead a priuat life are not afraid to reuenge themſelues: For they heare that it is a counſell, not a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement. Others do think that all Magiſtracie and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill offices are vnworthie a Chriſtian man. VVe read ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of men, who forſaking wedlock, and leauing the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of the common wealth, haue hid themſelues in Monaſteries. That they called, to flie out of the world, and to ſeeke a kinde of life, which is more acceptable to God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="564" facs="tcp:8251:274"/>
neither did they ſee, that God is to be ſerued in thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements, which he himſelfe hath deliuered, not in the commaundements, which are deuiſed by men. That is a good and perfect kinde of life, which hath the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of God for it warrant. It is neceſſarie to admoniſh men of theſe thinges. And before theſe times Gerſon did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend this errour of the perfection of Monkes, and he witneſſeth, <hi>that in his time this was a new or ſtrange voice, that the Monaſticall life is a ſtate of perfection.</hi> Thus many wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked opinions doe cleaue faſt vnto vowes, as that they me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit remiſſion of ſinnes &amp; iuſtification, that they are Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an perfection, that they do keepe the counſells and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements, that they haue works of ſupererogation. All theſe thinges, ſeing they be falſe and vaine, do make vowes to be of no effect.</p>

For the Church, doth know, that God doth moſte ſeuerelie forbid wandring luſtes amongſt mankinde, and that he would haue chaſtitie ſo to be vnderſtoode, and performed, as he himſelfe hath ordeined it, that we alſo maie know, that he is a pure and a chaſte minde, and maie diſcerne him from deuils, whoe through the hatred they beare to God, are delighted with the confuſions of luſts, &amp; doe driue forward this weake na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man, that it maie be horriblie defiled. Wherefore both the Heathen did euerie where admitte ceratine foule examples, and Heretikes at all times haue ſpreade abroad monſtrous opinions touching wedlocke, as <hi>Clemens Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drinus,</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius</hi> doe declare. And the Turkiſh man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and the lawe of the Pope, concerning ſingle life, haue cauſed a great deformitie in this laſt olde age of the world. But Paull doth affirme, that it is a ſigne of euill Spirites, to forbid marriage.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore we doe verie carefullie keepe the ſincere do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of God touching marriage, and by the mercie of God our ciuill Magiſtrates haue appointed, and doe defende
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:8251:274"/>
iudgements for Marriage matters in their gouernment, and they doe ſeuerelie puniſh thoſe wicked deeds which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the lawe of God, and know that by the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of God they are inioyned to haue a care to defende chaſtitie, and wedlocke. And we retaine this true definition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> agreeing with the commaundements of God, and the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of the Apoſtolique Church. Marriage is a lawfull and indiſſoluble coniunction, onelie of one man and of one woman, to be kept becauſe of the commaundement of God, whoe by this meane will haue mankinde aſſociated, chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to be vnderſtoode, and luſtes not to wander. God in the beginning did conſecrate this order, ſaying thus, <hi>They ſhall be two in one fleſh,</hi> to wit, one man, and one onelie wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man inſeperablie ioyned together. And againe, this firſt lawe was eſtabliſhed of Chriſt, Math. 19. Now that this coupling together maie be lawfull, we doe immutably ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the differences of perſons, that we maie not make a mixture of thoſe perſons, whoe by the lawe of God are not permitted to couple together. <note n="*" place="margin">looke the 1. obſeruat. vpon this confeſſ.</note>Alſo we keepe the rules of the Canon lawe, touching other neerer degrees, as there be ordinances to be ſeene deliuered with graue and wiſe deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration in our Conſiſtories.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer, we know it is the will of God, that Marriage ſhould not be for bidden to anie perſons, that be fit thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and which, without Marriage, could not liue without daunger of their conſcience, as it is written, Gen. 2. Math. 19<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1. Cor. 7. Therefore we giue leaue to Prieſtes and other perſons, to marie, which had rather liue godlie in Marriage, then in a ſingle life to haue wounded conſciences, ſo that they may not inuocate God, and liue holilie. In affiances, euen according to the auncient lawes, we will haue the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Parentes alſo, ſeeing that Parentes are mooued with a probable reaſon. Touching diuorcementes, this rule is moſt firmelie held, that they doe ſin, who either by adultery, or by forſaking, be the firſt cauſe of diſtraction: and adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers and adultreſſes, and he and ſhee that doth foſake the other, are condemned by the voice of them that preach in our Churches, and of the Iudges in our Conſiſtories, and they be ſeuerelie puniſhed of our Magiſtrates. But the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent perſon (when as the matter beeing well knowne, he is
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:8251:275"/>
ſet free) is not forbid to marrie, that he maie inuocate God, &amp; liue holilie. For ſeing that the Lord doth expreſſelie ſet at libertie the innocent perſon, Math. 19. when as the other partie is polluted with adulterie, we muſt vnderſtande a ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at libertie, not in name onelie, but in deede. And Paull ſpeaketh after the ſame manner, in the caſe of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking. This our cuſtome doth alſo agree with the auncient Church. The other lawes which we haue in our Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories, <note n="*" place="margin">looke the 2. oſeru.</note>doe agree with the Canon lawe: and we doe tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie propound vnto the people the wholl doctrine touching mariage and chaſtitie.</p>
                  <p>VVe affirme, that all commixtions, and ſpilling of the ſeed without marriage, are ſinnes condemned of god, <note n="*" place="margin">Looke the 3. obſeru.</note>as mortall ſinnes, and ſuch as driue out of men the holie Ghoſt, and that manie greeuous puniſhmentes are ſpreade throughout mankinde, by reaſon of luſts, as it is written, <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicatours and adulterers God will iudge.</hi> And there is a threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of theſe puniſhmentes ſet downe, Leuit. 18. Now we counte that to be chaſtitie, both to keepe puritie in a ſingle life, and alſo to haue the lawes of wedlocke obſerued: and we affirme wedlocke, as we did before deſcribe it, to be a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie inſtituted, and conſecrated of God, and that this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſocietie, and the dueties of a life in wedlocke, doe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe God.

Touching other cauſes we ſhall ſpeake hereafter: for thoſe popiſh lawes and vowes are flat contrarie to the lawe of God. The Lorde ſaide, <hi>It is not good for man to be alone: He ſaid,</hi> that is, by his vnſpeakeable wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom he decreed in this ſorte to make mankinde, that by the ſociety of man and woman it might be propagated.

Tatianus, the Pope, and the Monkes doe ſaie the contrary: whoe when as they forbidde mariage, doe giue occaſion to manie men, being otherwiſe fit vnto vertue, to heape vp manie horrible ſinnes, by reaſon whereof verie manie do fal headlong into eternall deſtruction, and the wrath of God is the more kindled againſt wholl mankinde. A lawe of man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being contrarie to the decree of God, and to the verie worke of God inſtituted and eſtabliſhed in the creation, and alſo to the commaundementes of God, and that lawe, which is the fountaine of great wickednes and hainous deedes, for the which both manie doe periſh, and the wrath of God is the more kindled, yea which lawe the holie Ghoſt doth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme to haue it beginning from the deuill, is in no caſe to be laide vpon the Church, but by the conſent of all godlie men to be aboliſhed. Now it hath fallen out verie often with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in theſe 30. yeares, that Prieſtes, whoſe manners were blameles, and honeſt, haue chiefelie beene put to death becauſe they were maried. Thus the Deuill goeth about to eſtabliſh his lawe by moſte cruell murthers, and he hath for his inſtruments, moſte impudent writers, Ecchius, Faber, Pighius, whoe hath expreſſelie written, <hi>That a Prieſt doth leſſe offend, if he be an adulterer, then if he marrie a wife.</hi> It is an vnworthie thing that theſe, who will be counted Chriſtians, ſhould write and ſpeake ſuch thinges. Wiſe men doe ſee that in this declining age of the world, both the nature of men is more weake, and by litle and litle there is greater re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſing and confuſion of diſcipline.

The ſtudie of doctrine is either none at all, or verie corrupt. Theſe onely cauſes are great inough, why men, which are not prophane, ought to depart out of ſuch ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: becauſe that the vows, which wrap the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in a kinde of life, wherein is the worſhip of Idolls, are without doubt fruſtrate, according to the firſt commaundement which is immooue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, eternall, and the rule of all other commaundements, <hi>Thou ſhalt haue no ſtrange Gods,</hi> Exod. 20. They do bring a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie out of Paull, 1. Tim. 5. Concerning widowes, <hi>They haue loſt their firſt faith:</hi> But the anſwer is ſure and cleare, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Paul ſhould ſpeake of vowes, yet would he in no caſe alow of ſuch vowes, as are ioyned with the worſhip of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolls, and with manie errors. But there be alſo manie other lies in vowes. They promiſe chaſtitie &amp; pouerty: but how many of them be fit to lead a ſingle life, they themſelues doe know. And touching pouerty, they know that the farre greater part doth there rather ſeeke kitchins well furniſhed, then for pouertie and hunger.</p>
                  <p>Now we muſt alſo conſider of this: let eloquent men ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe and praiſe the Monaſticall life as they liſt, yet alwaies this opinion is confirmed in men, that are not prophane, by this example, that ſuch workes, choſen by mans diuiſe, are the worſhip of God: that is, ſuch works whereby God doth count himſelfe to be honoured.

<pb n="570" facs="tcp:8251:277"/>
is a true and notable reprehenſion of the Monaſticall life. Now if they do faigne hereunto merites and perfections, the goſpell of Chriſt touching the righteouſnes of faith and true worſhip, is the more obſcured: becauſe it is a foule and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible lie, that monaſtical obſeruations ſhould merit remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſins, or be of ſo great value, as is Baptiſme, as Thomas doth expreſſely ſaie: Neither was antiquity ignorant of this reprehenſion. There is a narration extant, whether it be true, or written onelie for doctrines ſake, yet doth it ſhew forth the iudgements of godlie men: <hi>They write, that when An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonie, deſired to know, how much he had profited before God in thoſe externall exerciſes, there was ſhewed vnto him a coblers houſe at A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria, being next dore to him. He therefore going in ſpeaketh to the goodman of the houſe, queſtioneth with him concerning do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, &amp; exerciſes of godlines. The cobler anſwereth ſincerely tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching doctrine. Afterward he ſaith, that in the morning in a ſhort praier he giueth thankes to God, both for other benefits, and that he ſent his ſonne: then that he doth aske remiſſion of his ſinnes for the Sonnes ſake, and praie that God would preſerue the Church, and his familie: alſo that he praieth to the Sonne, tomake interceſſion for vs: and that he doth reſt in this faith, and doth his domeſticall affaires ioyfullie, and prouide that his Children may be well taught. And vſeſt thou no other ſtreighter exerciſe, ſaith Antonie? why, ſaith he, doth he labour a litle, trow you, that prouideth how his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie ſhall be manteined? and many thinges do often times happen, which do ſurelie vex him that gouerneth a houſe, beſide other bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens which he hath common with the Citizens. Doeſt thou not ſee, how manie priuate and publique miſeries there be in this life? and to beare theſe well, and in them to exerciſe faith &amp; patience, doeſt thou not think it a warfare hard inough? Antonie went his waie, and vnderſtood that he was admoniſhed, not to preferre his owne exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, before the dueties of this common life.</hi> Theſe, and other like narrations are read, which although th ey be ſo written for doctrines ſake, yet they do declare the iudgements of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men. Neither is it now needful to ad a longer diſcourſe, eſpeciallie ſeeing that no man is ignorant, how that in thoſe places, where Monkes be, there is much wicked ſuperſtition in Monaſteries, and that the ſtudies of doctrine are either none at all, or verie corrupt.

And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt doth euidentlie affirme, that wedlock doth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine to this preſent life and the adminiſtration of the things of this life doe conſiſt of publique lawes being made vpon right and probable reaſon, therfore we teach that it is lawful to marry in theſe degrees of conſanguinity &amp; affinity which <note n="*" place="margin">looke the 2. oſeru.</note>the politique lawes, which are the ordinances of God, do permit. Alſo we teach, that thoſe which be young ought not to marie without the authoritie of their parentes, and that the marriage which is contracted by a raſh and vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full conſent of young parties without the authoritie of them, in whoſe power they are, is not to be counted as ratified<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For although there be certaine caſes, wherein it is lawfull to marrie without the conſent of parentes, yet it ſeemeth not good to make a generall rule thereof, as though euery con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of young parties, ſhould ratifie the contract of mariage, and as though priuie mariages were to be approoued. For not onelie the commaundement of God doth require, that children ſhould honour their Parentes, but alſo natural rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon doth commaund, that the conſent of parentes ſhould be requeſted in making a marriage: hitherto alſo are children called by the politique lawes. And there is a decree of Pope Euaraſtus extant, the wordes whereof be theſe: <hi>Marriage as we heaue hard of our Fathers &amp; haue found it deliuered vnto vs of the Apostles, and their ſucceſſours, is not otherwiſe made lawfull, but when a wife is ſought for at their handes, and affianced by the neereſt Parentes, whoe ſeeme to haue authoritie ouer the maide or woman, and in whoſe cuſtodie ſhee is.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Morouer we do not dout, but that they which are in deed louers of honeſtie, do thinke that it is not free for the laie men onlie, as they call them, but alſo for the miniſters of the Church, to marrie. For the Epiſtle to the Hebrewes ſaith, <hi>Marriage is honourable in all men, and the bed that is vndefiled.</hi> And Paull aloweth of Marriage in a Biſhoppe, and affirmeth that <hi>the forbidding of Marriage is a ſpirit of errours, and a doctrine</hi>
                     <pb n="572" facs="tcp:8251:278"/>
                     <hi>of Deuilles.</hi> For though this ſaying of Paull is commonlie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of the Tatians and Eucratians, whoe thought that Marriage doth nothing at all differ from whoredome, yet notwithſtanding ſeeing that marriage is forbidden in the popiſh decrees, it is forbidden by the ſame reaſons, by the which mariage is wholie condemned, and not in one kinde of men onelie. For that ſaying is alledged out of Leuiticus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Be ye holie, becauſe I am holie:</hi> and that of Paull, <hi>Not in chamberings and wantonnes:</hi> And againe, <hi>They which are in the fleſh, cannot pleaſe God,</hi> But ſeeing that theſe ſayings of the Scripture doe perteine to all men, certainelie they might driue all godlie men from mariage, if they were fitlie applied to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid marriage vnto Prieſtes. But we hope that all good men doe thinke more honeſtlie of marriage, and that they do not diſlike of that in the miniſters thereof, which they did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue in the Church it ſelfe, eſpeciallie ſeeing that there be manifeſt examples of the Church, when as yet it was but freſh and more pure, wherein it was lawfull, both for the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, which was the higheſt degree in the Church, and alſo for Biſhops, to haue their wiues. And we thinke that this thing is ſo to be vnderſtood, that it was not onelie lawful for the miniſters of the Church to be married, before they were ordained miniſters, but alſo to marrie after theirordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For which opinion there be very euident argumentes.</p>
                  <p>Neither ought the vowe of chaſtitie to be any hinderance herin, becauſe that ſuch a vow beingtaken vpon a man by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſuperſtition, without the authoritie of the word of god, and againſt faith, is not acknowledged of God, and wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locke alſo hath it chaſtitie, that he which before had vowed chaſtitie, and marrieth a wife in the Lord, doth indeed full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill the vowe of chaſtitie. Seeing therefore that the worde of God is euident, touching th e honeſtie of wedlocke, the examples of the Apoſtles and Biſhoppes of the primitiue Church be euident, the weakenes of mans nature is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, daungers of ſingle life be euident, and ſeeing that the offences, which vnchaſte Prieſtes doe giue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are euident, we doe verily hope that it will come to paſſe, that they which haue the gouernment of the Church, will not goe forward ſeuerelie to maintaine and defend this conſtitution touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the marirage of Prieſtes, but fauourablie to interpret it.
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:8251:278"/>
For ſo it ſhal come to paſſe, that there may be both fewer and leſſe offences in the Church, and that manie good mens conſciences maie be relieued. Alſo we hope that it will come to paſſe, that all good Biſhoppes and princes will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them, whoe, by a lawfull diuorce<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are ſeparated from their adulterous wiues or huſbandes, to vſe that libertie of marrying againe in the Lord, which the Sonne of God our Lord Ieſus Chriſt hath graunted to them, Math. 5. and 16.</p>

                  <p>THere is no doubt but that godlie, iuſt, and lawfull vowes are to be kept and paied, &amp; that wicked vowes are to be diſanulled.

For as in <hi>Chriſt there is neither Iew, nor Grecian, neither ſeruant nor free man,</hi> as Paull ſaieth, ſo in Chriſt, there is neither married, nor vnmarried. And as, <hi>In Chriſt Ieſus circumciſion auaileth nothing, but the keeping of the commaundementes of God, and a new creature:</hi> ſo alſo doth ſingle life auaile nothing, and wedlocke auaileth nothing, but to be renued in Chriſt Ieſus, and to obeie the calling of Chriſt. In the Councell held at Gangrum there was this Canon: <hi>If any of thoſe, who for the Lordes ſake doe keepe virginitie, is lifted vp againſt thoſe that be married, let him be accurſed.</hi> And another Canon ſaieth, <hi>If any man, for continencie, as it is thought, doeth weare a cloake, as beleeuing that hereby he hath righteouſnes, and doth deſpiſe others, who with reuerence doe weare other common and vſual kindes of garmentes, let him be accurſed.</hi> And Auguſtine <hi>De bono coniugali, Cap.</hi> 21. <hi>dareth not preferre the virginitie of the Baptiſt, before the wedlocke of Abraham.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore he that doth vowe virginitie or ſingle life, doth either vowe it, as a ſingular worſhippe of God (And then, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

It is to no better purpoſe to vowe pouertie. For ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou art poore by condition or eſtate, and poſſeſſeſt no earthly ſubſtance: (And then this croſſe, which God hath laid vpon thee, thou muſt beare it patientlie, which more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer if thou do vowe, thou doeſt nothing elſe, then if in thy ſickenes thou ſhouldeſt vowe, that thou woulded alwaies be ſicke, or that in thy infamie, thou ſhouldeſt alwaies vowe to be infamous: which kinde of vowe is rather a madnes, then godlines.) Or elſe thou doeſt poſſeſſe ſubſtance, and voweſt that, forſaking thy ſubſtance, thou wilt alwaies leade a poore life, and get thy liuing by begging, and obteine, by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of this vow, eternal life: and then this vow is firſt of all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the loue of thy neighbour, which requireth, that by thy begging thou be not troubleſome to anie, further then neceſſity compelleth: ſecondly it is contrary to faith in Chriſt, becauſe that he alone is the merit of eternall life. Therefore it is euident, that this kinde of vowe is vnlawfull &amp; wicked. But ſo to forſake thy ſubſtance, as to giue it to a common vſe, is not to follow after pouertie, but to prouide a more certeine and bountifull liuing for thy ſelfe: the which what manner of worſhip it is before God, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be vnknowne. And as for obedience, it is either referred to God, and then it is not an arbitrarie vowe, but of due ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie, of which obedience it is ſaide, <hi>Obedience is better then ſacrifice:</hi> Or elſe it is referred to man, and then of their owne accord they are to performe thoſe dueties, which the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect oweth to the Magiſtrate, children to the Parentes, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantes to their Lords, and ſchollers to their ſchoolemaſters.

Paull, whereby euerie chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian man doth aſſure himſelfe, that alrighteouſnes and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation is to be ſought for onelie in Chriſt Ieſus our Lorde, and is alſo aſſured, that he muſt at all times vſe all the things of this life, as to the profitte of our neighbours, ſo to the glorie of God: and that all which he hath is to be arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated, and moderated by the holie Ghoſt, who is the giuer of true adoption and true libertie, and that he ought freelie to permitte them to be appointed, and beſtowed both to the reliefe of his neighbours, and alſo to the aduancement of the glorie of God. Seing that we retaine this libertie, we ſhew ourſelues to be the ſeruants of Chriſt: when we betray it to men, addicting our ſelues to their inuentions, we doe like runnagates, forſake Chriſt, and flie to men. The which thing wee doe ſo much the more wickedlie, becauſe that Chriſt hath freed vs by his blood not by a vile or common price, and hath redeemed vs to himſelfe from the deadlie ſlauerie of Sathan. And this is the cauſe, why S. Paul wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the <hi>Galathians,</hi> did ſo much deteſt it, that they had addicted themſelues to the ceremonies of the law, though they were commaunded of God, whereas notwithſtanding, as we declared before, that might be farre better excuſed, then to ſubmit themſelues to the yoke of thoſe ceremonies,
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:8251:280"/>
which men haue feigned of their owne braine. For he did write, and that trulie, that they which admitte the yoke, of thoſe ceremonies, <hi>deſpiſe the grace of God, and count the death of Chriſt as a thing of nothing:</hi> and thereupon he ſaith, <hi>That he is afraid, leſt that he had beſtowed his labour among them in vaine:</hi> and he exhorteth them, <hi>That they would ſtand ſteadfaſt in that libertie, wherewith Chriſt hath made vs free, and not to be intangled againe, with the yoke of bondage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now it is euident, that Monkerie is nothing els then bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of traditions deuiſed by men, and in deede of ſuch as Paule hath by name condemned in the places which we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged. For vndoubtedlie they which profeſſe Monkerie do addict themſelues to thoſe inuentions of men for hope of merits. And hereupon it is, that they make it ſo hainous an offence, to forſake thoſe inuentions, and to imbrace the libertie of Chriſt. Therefore, ſeing that <hi>as well our bodie, as</hi>

                  <hi>our ſpirit, belong vnto God,</hi> and that in a double reſpect, to wit, of our condition, and Redemption, it can not be lawfull for Chriſtians, to make themſelues ſlaues to this Monaſticall ſeruitude, much les then for prophane ſeruants, to chaunge their Maſters. Moreouer it can not be denied, but that by ſuch like bondage, and vowes to liue after the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of men, a certaine neceſſitie (as it alwaies vſeth to be) of tranſgreſſing the law of God is brought in. For the law of <note place="margin">Mat. 15.</note>God doth require, that a Chriſtian man ſhould, as much as lieth in him, imploie his ſeruice to the benefit of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, his parents, kinred, and others, and of all thoſe, whome the Lord hath made his neighbours, and brought to him to be deliuered, in what place, time, or manner ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer their neceſſitie ſhall require it. Then let him imbrace that kinde of liuing, whereby he may chiefly prouide for the affaires of his neighbours, neither let him chuſe a ſingle life, but let him know that to renounce marriage, and to make himſelfe an Eunuch for the kingdom of heauen, that is, to further godlines, and the glory of God, it is a peculiar and a ſpeciall gift of God. For that edict which Paull did publiſh, ſtandeth firme and ſtedfaſt, neither can anie vowes of men make it fruſtrate; <hi>For the auoiding of whordome let euerie man</hi> (he excepteth none) <hi>haue his owne wife, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie woman hir owne husband. For all men doe not receiue that</hi>
                  <pb n="577" facs="tcp:8251:280"/>
                  <hi>worde, of taking vpon them a ſingle life for the kingdome of heauen,</hi> as Chriſt himſelfe doth witnes, then whome no man did more certenly know, and more faithfully teach, either of what force mans nature is, or what is acceptable to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Now it is certaine, that by theſe Monaſticall vowes, they which doe make them are bound to a certaine kinde of men, ſo that they thinke it not lawful to ſhew themſelues obedient and dutifull any longer, either to the Magiſtrate, or to their parents, or to anie men (onely the chiefe gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Monaſterie excepted) nor to releeue them with their ſubſtance, and leaſt of all to marrie a wife, though they be greatlie burned, and therefore they doe neceſſarilie fall into all kindes of diſhoneſties of life.</p>
               <p>Seeing therefore that it is euident, that theſe Monaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call vowes doe make a man, which is freed from the ſeruice of Chriſt, to be in daunger, not ſo much of the bondage of men, as of Sathan, and that they doe bring in a certaine ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie of tranſgreſſing the law of god, (according to the nature of all ſuch traditions as are deuiſed by men) and that therefore they be manifeſtlie contrarie to the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of god, we doe, not without cauſe, beleeue, that they are to be made fruſtrate, ſeeing that not onelie the written law, but alſo the law of nature doth commaund to diſanull a promiſe, if beeing kept it be a hindrance to good manners, not onelie to religion. Therefore we could not withſtand any which would change a monaſtical life, which is vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedlie a bondage to Sathan, for a Chriſtian life, as alſo we could not withſtand others of the Eccleſiaſticall order, who marrying wiues, haue imbraced a kinde of life, wherof their neighbours might looke for more profitte, and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter honeſtie of life, then of that kinde wherein they liued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. To conclude, neither did we take vpon vs to driue them from the right of wedlocke, who among vs haue perſeuered in the miniſterie of the worde of god, whatſoeuer chaſtitie they had vowed, for the cauſes before ſpecified, ſeeing that Saint Paull the chiefe mainteiner of true chaſtitie, doth ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit euen a Biſhop to be a married man. For we haue law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully preferred this one law of god before all lawes of men, <hi>For the auoiding of whoredome, let euerie haue his owne wife.</hi> Which law truelie, for that it hath beene reiected ſo long time, all

kindes of luſt, euen thoſe which are not to be named (be it ſpoken with reuerence to your ſacred M. O noble Ceſar) haue more then horribly ouerthrowne this Eccleſiaſticall order, ſo that at this daie amongſt men there be none more abhominable then they, which beare the name of Prieſts.</p>

And although there be many hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible confuſions, which grow from the Deuill, and the mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of men, yet the lawfull gouernment and ſocietie of men is ordained of God, and whatſoeuer order is yet left by the exceeding goodnes of God, it is preſerued for the Church ſake, as it is ſaid Rom. 13. and Pſal. 126. <hi>Except the Lords ke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And a Chriſtian man may vſe theſe thinges, as he vſeth meate, drinke, medecines, buying and ſelling. Neither doth he ſinne that is a Magiſtrate, and diſchargeth his vocation, that exerciſeth iudgement, that goeth to warre, that puniſheth lawfullie thoſe that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, &amp;c.

kept in order by ciuill gouernment, euen thoſe that ate not regenerate, and in this gouernment, the wiſdome, iuſtice, and goodnes of God toward mankinde, is moſte clearelie to be ſeene. His wiſdome is declared by order, which is in the diſcerning of vertues and vices and in the ſocietie of mankinde vnder lawfull gouernment, and in contracts gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and diſpoſed by maruelous wiſdome. Then the iuſtice of God appeareth in ciuill gouernment, in that he will haue open ſinnes to be puniſhed by the Magiſtrates, and when they that are in authoritie doe not take puniſhment on of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders, God himſelfe miraculouſlie draweth them vnto puniſhment, and proportionablie doth lay vpon grieuous ſinnes, grieuous puniſhment in this life: as it is ſaid, Mat. 26. <hi>Whoſoeuer taketh the ſword, ſhall periſh with the ſword.</hi> &amp; Heb. 3. <hi>Whoremongers and adulterers, God will iudge.</hi> In theſe puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments God will haue to be ſeene the differences of vertues and vices, and will haue vs learne that God is wiſe, iuſt, true, and chaſte. The goodnes of God alſo toward mankinde is ſeene<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in that he preſerueth the ſocietie of men after this order. And for that cauſe doth he maintaine it, that from thence his Church may be gathered, &amp; he wil haue common wealthes to be places for the enterteinment of his Church. And the ciuill gouernment is one thing, which keepeth in order all men, euen thoſe that are not regenerate: and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenes of ſinnes, and righteouſnes in the heart, which is the beginning of life and of eternall ſaluation, which by the voice of the goſpell is effected in the hearts of them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, is another thing. Both theſe benefits god hath beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vpon mankinde, and will haue vs to vnderſtand the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of ciuill iuſtice, and light in our hearts. Neither doth the goſpel condemne or ouerthrow common welthes or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies.

               <p>Firſt, God would that the Magiſtrate without all doubt ſhould ſound forth the voice of the morall law among men, touching diſcipline, according to the 10. commaundements or the law naturall; that is, he woulde haue by the voice of the Magiſtrate, firſt ſoueraigne and immutable lawes to be
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:8251:289"/>
propounded, forbidding the worſhip of Idols, blaſphemies, periuries, vniuſt murders, wandring luſtes, breach of wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock, theft, and fraude in bargaines, contracts, and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>The ſecond dutie. Let the Magiſtrate be an obſeruer of theſe diuine and immutable lawes, which are witneſſes of God, and chief rules of manners, by puniſhing all thoſe that tranſgreſſe the ſame. For the voice of the law without pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment and execution is litle auaileable to bridle and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine men. Therefore it is ſaid by S. Paull, Rom. 13. <hi>The Magiſtrate is a terrour to him that doth euill, and giueth honour to them that doe well,</hi> And well hath it beene ſaid of olde, <hi>The Magiſtrate is a keeper of the Law,</hi> that is, of the firſt and ſecond Table, as concerning diſcipline and good order.</p>
               <p>The third dutie of the ciuill Magiſtrate is to adde vnto the law naturall, ſome other lawes, defining the citcumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the natural law, and to keepe and maintaine the ſame by puniſhing the tranſgreſſours: but at no hand to ſuffer or defend lawes contrarie to the law of God or nature, as it is written, Eſai. 10. <hi>Woe be to them that make wicked lawes.</hi> For kingdoms are the ordinance of God, wherein the wiſdome and iuſtice of God, that is, iuſt lawes ought to rule, euen as the wiſe King, and one that feared God, Ioſaphat ſaid, 2. Chron. 19. <hi>Ye exerciſe not the iudgement of men, but of God, who is with you in iudgement.

Alſo we offer our ſelues at any time, to a more full declaration in in euerie point; and we thinke that this rehearſall of our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine now made is agreeable to the confeſſion exhibited at Auſpurge, Anno. 1530.</p>
                  <p>For as much therefore as the doctrine, which we here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite, is true, and neceſſarie for the Church, we intreat that our Churches may not be condemned, as if they either im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced errours, or fooliſhlie or ſeditiouſlie ſtirred vp ſtrife without any weightie cauſe. The truth, and weight of the matters may deliuer vs from this vniuſt accuſation. Next after a godly manner, we admoniſh the Councell itſelfe. They ſee that olde abuſes and many great errours are as yet ſticking in the Church, becauſe in al ages euen from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of mankinde the deuil co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinueth ſcattering his ſeed of errour, and ſince that time through the ignorance of men, by ſuperſtition they are either confirmed, or do ſhoote forth againe.

               <p>WE haue rehearſed thoſe things, which ſeeme good both to be approued, and alſo to be refuted, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended in the Eccleſiaſticall doctrine, and in the wholl ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Church. And if anie thing be ſpoken ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more brieflie, or more obſcurelie, then ſo great a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter would require, our Preachers do promiſe that they will expouud them more largelie, and more cleerlie. That which remaineth, we beſeech all the godly through Ieſus Chriſt the ſonne of God, our onelie Sauiour, that (which thing we hope they wil do of their owne accord) euerie one according to his office and calling, would take vnto himſelfe a true and earneſt endeauour to reforme the Church. It can not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, but that hitherto for theſe manie yeares not onelie the diſcipline of the Church hath decaied, and the manners thereof haue beene corrupted with great and horrible vices, and they haue verie much degenerated from the honeſtie of our Elders, but that alſo the doctrine of the Church hath beene depraued in ſuffering and bearing with corruptions: which if hereafter they be either diſſembled, or confirmed, euerie man that is but meanlie wiſe maie conſider, how great euills are like to follow in the Church of God. Thoſe execrations and curſings are well knowne, whereunto the
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:8251:293"/>
law of god doth addict the transgreſſours of his word. And Ioſias the King of Iuda, was endued with an heroicall minde, when he repaired the Church, and although the wrath of god was by his godlie repentance and obedience mitigated (after that the Booke of the law was found out, and well knowne) that thoſe puniſhments, which the Church of god at that time had deſerued, through the neglect of his word and their impietie, might be differred till another time yet notwithſtanding ſuch was the ſeueritie of god againſt the contemners of his word, and the impenitent, that the King although he were verie godlie, could not altogether take it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie from them, and appeaſe it. Now we thinke that in theſe times the wrath of god is no leſſe, yea much more grieuouſly kindled, and ſet on fire againſt the aſſemblie of his Church, (by reaſon of ſo manie hainous wicked deeds and offences, which euen in that people which glorieth in the name of god, are more euident, then that they can be denied, and more cleere, then that they maie be excuſed) then in times paſt, when as yet the Sonne of god was not made knowne to the world by his goſpell: And the iudgement of god ſhall be ſo much the more ſeuere, by how much his benefits are the greater, which he ſeemeth to haue beſtowed, both in the former, and alſo at theſe preſent times vpon vnthankful men.</p>
               <p>But both many other things haue need of amendment in the Church and miniſterie thereof, and eſpeciallie the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of repentance, Iuſtification, and the vſe of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſingle life of the Miniſters of the Church, do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a godlie amendment. If theſe things by the mercie of God, and by the diligence and care of all good men ſhall be reſtored, according to the writings of the Prophets and the Apoſtles, and according to the true Catholique conſent of the auncient and purer Church, we ſhall not onelie giue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to god the father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt a moſt acceptable worſhip, but alſo the wholl Chriſtian world ſhal be ſtirred vp, to declare their thankfulnes and obedience in all duetifull manner that they maie. We truelie do not know of anie er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in our Preachers, either in doctrine, or in the other ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Church: yet we do not doubt, but that they are indued with ſo great modeſtie and godlines, that if

they be admoniſhed by the teſtimony of the heauenly do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine &amp; by the true conſent of the Catholique Church, they wil in no caſe be wanting to the edifying of the church And as much as lieth in vs, and in our gouernment, we will do our indeuour, that the mercy of godhelping vs, none of thoſe dueties may be pretermitted of vs, whereby we hope that the true quietnes of the Church, and ſaluation in Ieſus Chriſt the ſonne of god, may be preſerued.</p>

                  <p>IN the former points we haue declared, that our Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers doe place that obedience which is giuen vnto Magiſtrates, among good workes of the firſt degree, and that they teach, that euerie man ought ſo much the more diligently to applie himſelfe to the publique lawes, by how much he is a more ſincere Chriſtian, &amp; richer in faith. In the next place they teach, that to execute the office of a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, it is the moſt ſacred function, which can happen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to man from God, whereupon alſo it is come to paſſe, that they which are endued with publique authoritie, are in the Scriptures called <hi>Gods.</hi> For when as they doe iuſtlie and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derlie behaue themſelues in their function, it goeth well with the people both in doctrine, and in life: becauſe that God doth vſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>o to moderate our affaires, that for the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter parte, the ſafetie and deſtruction of the ſubiects doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pende vpon them which are the gouernours. Wherefore none doe more worthelie execute Magiſtracie, then they which of all others are the moſt Chriſtian, and Biſhops and other Eccleſiaſtical men were promoted by moſt godly Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours &amp; kings to an external gouernment in ciuil affaires. Wherein though they were religious and wiſe, yet in this one point they offended, becauſe they were not able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge both thoſe functions ſufficiently, and it was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, that either they ſhould be wanting to the Churches in ruling them by the word, or to the common wealth, in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerning it by authoritie.</p>

                  <head>THE CONCLVSION.</head>
                  <p>THeſe be the chiefe pointes, moſte mightie and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uos Emperour, wherein our Preachers haue ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſwarued from the common doctrine of preachers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forced thereunto by the onelie authoritie of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which is worthelie to be preferred before all other traditions. Theſe things, being ſo declared, as the ſhortnes of time would giue vs leaue, we thought it good to offer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to your ſacred Maieſtie, and that to this ende, that we might both giue account of our faith to thee, whome next vnto God we doe chiefelie honour and reuerence, and might alſo ſhew how neceſſarie it is, ſpeedely and earneſtlie to conſult of a way and meane, whereby a thing of ſo great importance, maie be knowen, diligentlie weighed, and diſcuſſed, as the honour which we doe chiefelie owe to God (in whoſe chiefe matter it behooueth vs to be conuerſant with feare &amp; and trembling) doth require. Secondlie, it is a thing wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of your ſacred Maieſtie, (which is ſo much commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for the name of religion and clemencie). To conclude, the very meane to attaine to that certaine and ſound peace, which your ſacred Maieſtie goeth about, doth require it: which peace, ſeeing that we doe varie about faith and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, can no other waies be obteined, then when as before all other thinges the mindes be plainelie inſtructed concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the trueth.</p>
                  <p>But peraduenture it might ſeeme needeles, that we in theſe matters ſhould vſe ſo many words, ſeing that the moſt famous Prince Electour of Saxony and others haue very largely and ſoundly declared vnto your ſacred Maieſty thoſe things, which at this daie are in controuerſy in our holy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. But becauſe that your ſacred Maieſtie hath deſired that all they, who haue any intereſt in this buſines, ſhould declare vnto you their iudgement concerning Religion, we alſo thought it our duety, to confeſſe thoſe things vnto your ſacred Maieſtie, which are taught among vs. Howbeit this matter is ſo large, &amp; comprehendeth ſo many thinges, that euen thoſe thinges which we haue declared on both ſides, are as yet fewer, and more briefelie declared, then that
<pb n="601" facs="tcp:8251:295"/>
we maie hope, preſentlie to haue ſome certeintie deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in the controuerſies, and that ſuch, as may be approo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, not of all, but at the leaſt of a good parte of Chriſtian people: So few is the number of thoſe that doe ſubſcribe to the trueth. Therefore ſeeing that this matter is ſo weighty, ſo diuers and, manifold, and can not fruitfully be decided, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be well knowne and ſifted of many, we beſeech your ſacred Maieſty, and moſt humblie requeſt you by god and our Sauiour, whoſe glory without doubt you do chiefely ſeek, that you would procure, as ſpeedily as may be, that a general, free, and a Chriſtian Councell in deed may be ſummoned, which hitherto hath ſemed ſo neceſſary a thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> both to your ſacred Maieſtie, and alſo to other Princes of the ſacred Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, for the ſetting of Eccleſiaſtical affaires at a ſtay, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in all aſſemblies throughout the Empire, which haue been gathered together ſince the beginning of this variance about religion, both your ſacred Maieſties commiſſioners and other Princes of the Empire, haue openly witneſſed, that there was no other waie in theſe matters, to bring that to pas which might be wholſome. Whereupon in the laſt aſſembly held at Spire, your ſacred Maieſtie gaue occaſion to hope, that the Biſhop of Rome would notwithſtand it, but that ſuch a Councell might with ſpeed be ſummoned.</p>
                  <p>But if ſo be that in time we may not haue opportunitie for a generall Councell, yet at the leſt your ſacred maieſtie may appoint a Prouinciall aſſemblie, as they call it, of the learned men of euery degree and ſtate, whereunto all, for whome it is expedient to be preſent, may freelie and ſafely reſorte, euery man may be heard, and all thinges may be weighed, and iudged, by ſuch men, whome it is certaine, as being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with the feare of God, to make the chiefeſt account of the glorie of God. For it is not vnknowne, how grauelie, &amp; diligentlie in times paſt both Emperours and Biſhops be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haued themſelues in deciding the controuerſies of faith, which notwithſtanding were oftentimes of much leſſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then thoſe which doe preſentlie trouble Germanie, ſo that they thought it not an vnworthie thing for themto examine the ſelfe ſame things the ſecond, and the third time. Now he that ſhall conſider, how things ſtand at this preſent, he can not doubt, but that at this day there is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="603" facs="tcp:8251:295"/>
need, then euer was heretofore, of greater faithfulnes grauitie, meeknes, and dexteritie, to this ende, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of Chriſt maie be reſtored into her place. For if ſo be that we haue the truth, as we doe vndoubtedlie beleeue, how much time and labour, I pray you, is requiſite that they may know the truth, without whoſe conſent or patience at the leaſt, ſounde peace can not be obtained? But if we doe erre (from rhe which we doe not doubt but we be far) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine the matter will not require ſlouthfull diligence nor a ſhort time, that ſo many thouſand men may be called into the way againe. This diligenee and time it ſhall not be ſo vnſeemelie for your Maieſtie to beſtow, as it is meete that you ſhould expreſſe his minde toward vs, in whoſe ſtead you doe gouerne ouer vs, to wit, the minde of Ieſus Chriſt the Sauiour of vs all who, ſeeing that he came with this minde, to ſeeke, and to ſaue that which was periſhed, ſo that he vouchſafed alſo to die, that he might redeeme them which were loſt, there is no cauſe, why your ſacred Maieſtie ſhould thinke much, although you ſhould vndoubtedlie beleeue, that we are fallen from the truth, to leaue the ninty nine ſheepe in the wildernes, and to ſeeke for the hundreth, and to bring it backe into the ſheepefolde of Chriſt, that is, to preferre this buſines before all other things, that the meaning of Chriſt in euery of theſe things, which at this preſent are in controuerſie, may out of the Scriptures be plainlie and certeinlie laide open vnto vs, though we be but a few in number and of the meaner ſort, and we for our parts will ſhew our ſelues willing to be taught, (onely let all obſtinacie be remooued) ſo that it may be lawfull to heare the voice of our ſhepheard Ieſus Chriſt: and let all things ſtay and reſt vpon the Scriptures (which teach what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer is good) whereunto we ſhall be called. For if it ſhould ſo fall out, that the care of teaching vs being reiected, there ſhould compendious formes of Edicts be ſought (which we doe nothing feare whileſt the matter is in the hand of your ſacred Maieſtie) it can not be ſaid, into what ſtraightes innumerable thouſands of men ſhould be brought, to wit, of thoſe, whome, as beeing perſwaded that God is chieflie to be heard, and then that thoſe things which follow as opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons muſt ſtay vpon the vndoubted oracles of God, theſe
<pb n="604" facs="tcp:8251:296"/>
ſayings of our Sauiour doe alwaies appale: <hi>Feare not them which kill the bodie. He that ſhall looſe his ſoule, ſhall finde it. He that ſhall not hate Father and Mother, &amp;c. yea euen his owne ſoule, he can not be my Diſciple. He that ſhal be aſhamed of me, before this froward and adulterous nation, of him will I be aſhamed before my Father and his Angells,</hi> And ſuch like.</p>
                  <p>Many men being mooued with theſe thundering ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, haue reſolued with themſelues to ſuffer all extremitie: and many for feare of death doe rather ſeeke delaies, but yet waiting for a fit opportunitie, if they ſhould be dealt withalin this matter by authority, before they be dealt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all by doctrine, and by force, before their errour ſhould be made knowne vnto them. For of what force a ſound per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of Religion is, and how it maketh men to make no account not onelie of their goods, but alſo of their liues, it hath bin ſeene more then ſufficientlie in very many, euen within theſe 10. yeares (that we may ſay nothing of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ages) who haue willinglie ſuffered not onely baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and proſcriptions, but alſo torments, and death it ſelfe, rather then they would ſuffer themſelues to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawne from that iudgement which they had conceiued, and which they beleeued to be true. If now a daies when as there is contention of thoſe lighter matters, there be but a few to be found, whom a man may bring to vnfeigned con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde, except they may be perſwaded of the law, or the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie of conditions, how, when as the controuerſie is of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, ſhall we looke for true peace, and an vndoubted tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillitie in theſe matters, to wit, ſuch a one as your ſacred Maieſty goeth about to eſtabliſh, except that on both ſides it be agreed vpon, what things they be that God d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>th ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue, and what things be agreeable to the Scriptures? For as Religion, by right, and by the cuſtom of al nations, is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before all other things, ſo there neuer was any more vehement or ſharpe fight among men, then that which is vndertaken for Religion. But we, ſeeing that your ſacred Maieſtie hath vſed ſuch an vnſpeakeable clemency toward your enemies, and thoſe ſuch, as haue pretermitted no kinde of hoſtilitie, that we may let paſſe other things, haue not without cauſe receiued great hope, that you will ſo mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate all things euen in this matter alſo, that you wil much
<pb n="605" facs="tcp:8251:296"/>
more ſeeke for the praiſe of goodnes and courteſie in vs, who are moſt deſirous of your ſafetie and honour, as we haue in deed teſtified, and do from the bottome of ourhearts deſire yet farther to teſtifie. For we haue dealt ſo moderately in all points, that we haue made it euident enough to all good men, that it was neuer in our minde to hurt any man, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful to increaſe our commodities by the diſcommodities of other men. In deede we haue ſuſteined dangers for this cauſe, and ſpent exceeding much, but we haue not gained no not ſo much as a little thereby, this one thing excepted, that we being better inſtructed, touching the goodnes of God ſhewed vnto vs through Chriſt, we haue begun (by the grace of God) to hope better of thoſe things which are to come: and of that we doe by right make ſo great account, that we do not think that we either haue done, or ſuffered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing as yet worthie therof, ſeing that it is an ineſtimable thing, and to be preferred aboue all things, which are in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen or in earth. We haue bin ſo farre from emparing the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Eccleſiaſticall men, that when the husbandmen were in an vprour, we, to our great coſtes and dangers, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended them to their vſes. The Goſpell of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, as ſurelie as we would that he ſhould loue vs, is the onelie thing that enforceth vs, and hath cauſed vs to doe all theſe things, which we ſeeme to haue altered.</p>
                  <p>Therefore let it pleaſe your ſacred Maieſtie rather to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the examples of theſe moſt mightie and in deed happy Emperours, <hi>Conſtantine, Iouinian, Theodoſius,</hi> and ſuch like, who both by doctrine dailie taught in all meekenes by moſt holie and vigilant Biſhops, and alſo by Councels lawfully aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, and by a wiſe diſcuſſing of al things, did deale with them that erred, and aſſaied all meanes to bring them again into the way, before that they would determine any thing more ſharply againſt them; then to follow thoſe, who it is certaine had ſuch counſellers, as were moſt vnlike to thoſe auntient and holy Fathers in deed, and receiued an euent nothing anſwerable to the godlines of thoſe Fathers. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration hereof let not your ſacred Maieſty be withdrawne with this, that the chiefeſt matters, which are now in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie, were decided long ſince, and chieflie in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell held at Conſtance, eſpecially ſeeing you may ſee, that
<pb n="606" facs="tcp:8251:297"/>
of thoſe innumerable, no leſſe holie then neceſſary decrees of the former Councells, there is not ſo much as the leaſt point obſerued of our Eccleſiaſticall men, and that they haue ſo degenerated in all things, that no man which is but endued with common ſenſe, doth not cry out, that there is need of a Councell, to reſtore Religion, and the holines of the Eccleſiaſticall order. But if that doth like them ſo well which was decreed at Conſtance, how commeth it to paſſe, that by no meanes at all that decree euer ſince toke place, that Chriſtian Councells ſhould be aſſembled euery tenth yeare? the which thing was at that time decreed. For by this meane much godlines and faith might either be reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, or preſerued.</p>
                  <p>But what is he that will not confeſſe, that ſo often as the diſeaſe waxeth freſh, ſo often the remedy is to be vſed, and they which haue the truth in deed do neuer thinke it much, both that good men ſhould teach it, &amp; alſo defend it againſt the euill ſort, where anie fruit thereof may be hoped for? Now when as ſo many thouſand are ſo miſerablie intangled in the opinions of our religion, who can deny that there is hope of moſt plentiful fruit, and ſuch as hath iuſtlie enforced al thoſe that are gouerned by the ſpirit of Chriſt, that omitting all other things whatſoeuer, contemning all kinde of labour and coſt, they may giue themſelue wholly to this one thing, that the doctrine of Chriſt, which is the mother of all righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes and ſaluation, may be worthelie weighed or conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, purged from al errors, and offerd in it naturall colour to all thoſe that loue godlines and the true worſhip of God, to the end that a peace, and and ſuch as may be firme for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, &amp; a true ſetting of al holy things at a ſtay, may be reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and confirmed to the ſheepe of Chrtſt, for whome he hath ſhed his blood, which are now too much troubled and wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ering. The which peace can by no other mean, as we ſaid, be reſtored and confirmed vnto them, as being certein that in other things they are in ſome ſort to yeald or to giue place, but in the matter of godlines, they are ſo to ſtick, and bend themſelues to the word of God, that if they had a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand liues, they ſhould offer them to be tormented, rather then to yeald one iot, or in the leaſt point, which they are perſuaded to be the word of God. Now if one onely ſoule be
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:8251:297"/>
of more value then the wholl world, what ought we to do for the ſaluation of many thouſands? Certeinlie ſeeing we are allured by ſo great a hope, both by this, that they which are accuſed to your ſacred Maieſtie of errour, do deſire no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but that they may be taught, and haue wholly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted themſelues to the holie ſcriptures, which are fullie ſufficient to confute euerie errour: &amp; alſo thereby, that Chriſt our Sauiour hath made ſo large a promiſe, <hi>that where euen two or three be gathered together in his name, there he will be in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of them, &amp; graunt vnto them any thing wherupon they ſhal agree.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe thinges, moſt godlie Emperour, we do here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſe for no other cauſe, then to ſhew our ſelues obedient to your ſacred Maieſtie, which would haue vs alſo to declare what is our iudgement, concerning the reforming of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For otherwiſe we haue good hope that your ſacred Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty hath of late verie well conſidered, and doth ſufficiently perceiue, what neceſſitie doth enforce vs thereunto, what fruit doth allure vs, and to conclude, how worthie a thing this is for your ſacred Maieſtie, which is ſo much praiſed for religion and clemencie, that all the beſt learned and moſte godlie men beeing called together, they maie finde out of the diuine ſcriptures, what is to be thought of euerie point of doctrine, which are at this time in controuerſie, and then that it be expounded by the fit Miniſters of Chriſt, with all meekenes and faithfulnes, to them which are thought to be deteined in errors. Notwithſtanding herewithall it is to be feared, that there will not be men wanting, who will do their endeauour to withdraw your ſacred Maieſtie from this: vnto theſe men it ſeemed good to vs in this ſort to make auſwere as it were before your Maieſty. Let it pleaſe your ſacred Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty, according to your moſt excellent clemencie, for which you are renowmed, to take &amp; interpret in good part both this ſame, and all other things, (which we haue here expounded and confeſſed, for no other reſpect, then to defend the glory of Chriſt Ieſus our God, as our dutie requireth, and, as it is meet we ſhould, to obey your ſacred Maieſtie) and to count vs among thoſe, whoe truelie doe from our hearts deſire to ſhew our ſelues no leſſe obedient and addicted to your Maieſtie in all humble ſubiection, then were our Elders, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing readie in this point, ſo farre as is lawfull, to ſpend both

                     <hi>THat the body and blood of Chriſt are there in deed, and are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed, &amp;c.</hi> We alſo doe alowe of this, namely that the word of God is not deceitfull, and therefore as often as the holy ſignes are rightly giuen, that is, according to Chriſt his inſtitution, that then alſo the thing ſignified by the ſigne (which is the verie bodie of Chriſt crucified for vs, and the very blood of Chriſt ſhedd for vs) is alſo giuen to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. But we affirme that the thing ſignified is no otherwiſe coupled with the ſigne, then ſacramentallie. The trueth of which ſacramental coniunction, doth not conſiſt in this, that whereſoeuer the ſigne is, there the thing repreſented by the ſigne, ſhould alſo be preſent, but in this, that that which God promiſeth by the ſigne, he alſo doth offer to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. Therefore we hold that the bodie of Chriſt is not really preſent in, with, or vnder the bread, otherwiſe then after this ſacramentall manner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> both becauſe it is a true body, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing circumſcribed in his local ſituation, and alſo hath truly aſcended from the earth, aboue the heauens, that be ſubiect to our ſight, and ſhall there remaine (from whence he exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth a gouernment ouer al theſe beneath, euen as he is man) vntill he come truely from thence to iudge both quicke and dead. Moreouer we doe alſo auouch that as the ſignes are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to the bodie, ſo the thinges ſignified are offered to the minde<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore that the ſignes are receiued of euery one with the hand and mouth, that come vnto the ſupper: the which vnto ſome, namely, to the worthie receiuets, do turne vnto ſaluation, but vnto others, that is, the vnworthy communicants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by reaſon of the profanation of the ſignes, and contempt of the thing ſignified, they doe turne to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. As for the things ſignified thoſe we affirme to be truely, and effectuallie apprehended, onely of thoſe that be indued with a right minde and a true faith,, and that alwaies vnto ſaluation, whereunto the diſtance of place is no hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance, by reaſon of the vnſpeakeable operation of the holie Ghoſt. And yet not ſo as that the ſubſtances ſhould be mingled betwixt themſelues, or cleaue together in any place (for Chriſts fleſh abideth in heauen, and ours vpon the earth) but that (theſe things being myſticallie vnited<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb facs="tcp:8251:313"/>
which in true diſtance of ſituation are ſeperated) we might draw from the fleſh of Chriſt all gifts neceſſary for our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, and eſpeciallie that liuely iuiſe wherby we are nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed to eternall life. Therefore whatſoeuer they pretend which are of the contrarie iudgement, the controuerſie is not either of the ſigne, or of the thinges ſignified, or of the truth of the ſacraments, or of the receiuing of them, or of the effectes; but of the onely definition of the ſacramentall coniunction, &amp; alſo of the manner of receiuing the thinges ſignified. Both which we contend to be ſo interpreted by ſome out of the word of God, that if their opinion be once graunted, both the truth of Chriſtes bodie, his aſſention into heauen, and his ſecond comming is conſequentlie ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne. Looke the expoſition of this article expreſſed in the diuers editions of the Auſpurge confeſſion, though not after the ſame manner, &amp; in the ſame words, and for the full declaration therof look in the admonition lately ſet forth by our bretheren the Neuſtadians in the 5. chapter, out of the which our agreement in this point of doctrine rightly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red doth appeere.</p>
