         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IN Compiling this <hi>Engliſh Herbal of Phyſical Plants,</hi>
I have chiefly follow'd Mr. <hi>Ray,</hi> both for the Deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions
and Virtues, who is an excellent Botaniſt, and
a candid Author; and tho' he be not profeſſedly a
Phyſician, it may appear by his Writings, he has perus'd
the beſt Authors in Phyſick, and well digeſted them: And
yet the good Man would not rely on his own Judgment, or
Reading, but took to his Aſſiſtance ſeveral worthy Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners
in Phyſick, who all along ſuggeſted the most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
Virtues of Plants, and their Succeſs in Practice; and
aſcertain'd the Doſes of many of them, and added ſome
Forms of Medicines.</p>
            <p>What I have contributed to this Work, I confeſs, is the
leaſt Part: Some Virtues, indeed, I have added, and many
good Medicines; but thoſe I borrow'd too. So that, upon a
Review, I find little or nothing belongs to me, ſave only the
Collection, and Tranſlation; and for that I expect Cenſure.</p>
            <p>And therefore, in hope I may, at least, extenuate my
Crime, I take Leave to expoſtulate with my Adverſaries.
'Tis well known, many are, with good Reaſon, Authoriz'd
by the Spiritual Lords to practiſe Phyſick, who are only
skill'd in their Mother-Tongue, there being not learned
Phyſicians enough to attend on the Sick in theſe populous
Kingdoms; for if there were, to be ſure the Right Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
Biſhops, who are eminent for Learning, as well as
Piety, would of Choice prefer the Learned.</p>
            <p>Now, I ſay, it being evident that many Practitioners do
not underſtand Foreign Languages, and ſo, by Conſequence,
<pb facs="tcp:59977:3"/>
cannot partake of thoſe Improvements that are made abroad,
or conceal'd at home, in a Language to them unknown,
I ſuppoſe no ſober Man will blame me, or any other, for
Writing or Rendring into Engliſh ſuch things as may be
more generally conducive to the Health or Welfare of our
Country.</p>
            <p>But it is to little purpoſe to appeal to ſober Men, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
now-a-days the weakeſt and moſt contemptible Party,
and ſo can yield no Protection: He therefore that dares ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
any thing for publick Good, muſt expect publick Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred.
But, be it ſo; 'tis better to be beneficial to Men,
than to be belov'd by them: And the ſolid Comfort of Well-doing
infinitely ſurpaſſes the fleeting Praiſes of the giddy
Multitude: And no other Reward can the beſt Men receive,
as long as Men are encourag'd in their Vices, by great and
bad Examples. Yet it muſt be own'd, there is a Semblance
of Vertue ſtill remaining amongst us: Many take care to
give their Children good Education; the tender Infant,
before he can ſpeak plain, liſps the Praiſes of his Maker:
And he that ſhould look into publick Schools, or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities,
and obſerve there theſe excellent Precepts that are daily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtill'd
into Youth, would believe that their Lives muſt be
ever after unavoidably influenc'd thereby; but then ('tis a ſad
Truth) many vicious Parents, by their ill Examples, ſoon
poyſon thoſe wholſom Inſtructions; and the Striplings are
forc'd to abandon their Morals, to prove themſelves Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate.</p>
            <p>So that he that ſhould conſider the ſtrict Rules of Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and the Incongruity of Practice thereunto, would be
induc'd to believe, that Men ſucceſſively banter one another,
by propoſing ſuch Rules as they think are either impractica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
or not worth the minding: And if ſo, Why does Man
alone, of all the Creatures on God's Earth, impoſe upon his
Off-ſpring? Why does he not, with the milder Tyger, early
inſtruct his Young Ones in the Art of Rapine, and infuſe ſuch
ſavage Principles as are more peculiarly agreeable to the
Humane Nature, that in due time they may exert them
<pb facs="tcp:59977:3"/>
and act like Men? But if, at first View, Men dread the
fatal Conſequences of an intail'd War, and would fain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
the Happineſs of their Children, and the Peace of the
World, let them eſtabliſh, by an agreeable Converſation,
thoſe Rules of Civil Life our good Fore-fathers injoin'd; for,
after all, good Example, is more prevalent, and more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive
than Precept; and the general Neglect of it is
really the Source of all our Miſeries.</p>
            <p>In the Firſt Part of the following <hi>Herbal,</hi> I have only
deſcrib'd ſuch Plants as grow in <hi>England,</hi> and are not
commonly known; for I thought it needleſs to trouble the
Reader with the Deſcription of thoſe that every Woman
knows, or keeps in her Garden. And, becauſe this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
is deſign'd for general <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe, and, I hope, may be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
to Families in the Country, that are far diſtant
from Phyſicians, I have added an Explanatory Table, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the Terms of Art, and the Explication of them.
But here the Reader is to be admoniſh'd, that the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions
of Men are ſo various, and the Signs and Symptoms
of Diſeaſes ſo abſtruſe, that it is very hazardous, in many
Caſes, to adminiſter Phyſick without the Advice of a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician.</p>
            <p>In the Second Part of this Book, which treats of <hi>Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Plants,</hi> I have made no Deſcriptions of the Herbs,
or Trees; for I account it unneceſſary to deſcribe the Form
or Shape of that, which moſt of us are never like to ſee.</p>
            <p>The Gums, Balſams, Juices, and the like, that are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
treated of in this Part, contain the moſt eminent
Virtues of the Plants or Trees from whence they proceed;
and are imported a-part, and ſold ſo by the Druggiſt, and
make up a good part of the <hi>Materia Medica;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
may well deſerve to be handled ſeparately.</p>
            <p>To be plain, There is little or no Curioſity in this Work;
but I believe there will be found more Practice in it, than
in any <hi>Engliſh Herbal</hi> yet publiſh'd. The Virtues are
faithfully deliver'd, and not ſo promiſcuouſly as is cuſtomary
in Treatiſes of this kind: And the Medicines inſerted were
<pb facs="tcp:59977:4"/>
collected from the beſt Authors, many of which I have found
by Experience very ſucceſsful.</p>
            <p>To conclude, The Reader is deſir'd to take notice, that
ſome Engliſh Plants being omitted in the Firſt Part, were
added in the Second; but the <hi>Index</hi> will ſet all right, to
which I refer him.</p>

                  <p> The
Root has many thick Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres,
bound together; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
if it grows in
good Ground. It taſtes at
firſt ſweet, but leaves an
Acrimony and Bitterneſs on
the Palate. It has a tender
Stalk, about an Hand high,
which ſuſtains one Leaf,
that is Oyly, and without
Nerves; ſometimes narrow
and ſomewhat long, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
broad ſomewhat
round and erect; of a
ſweetiſh and clammy taſte.
A two-fork'd Tongue riſes
from the Leaf where 'tis
joyn'd to the Stalk, which
grows ſharp by degrees,
and is a little indented.
'Tis common in Meadows,
and moiſt Paſtures. It
ſprings in <hi>April,</hi> and fades
in <hi>July.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis an excellent Wound-Herb,
either taken inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
or outwardly applied.
For Ruptures, or Burſten
Bellies, Take as much of
the Powder of the dry'd
Leaves as will lye on a Six-pence,
or leſs, according to
the Age of the Party, in
two Ounces of Horſe-tail,
or Oak-bud-water, ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with Syrup of Quinces.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59977:6"/>
Uſe it every Morning for
the ſpace of fifteen Days.
But before you enter upon
the Uſe of this, or any other
Medicine, the Gut, if it fall
into the Cod, muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
by a Chirurgeon, and
a Truſs muſt be worn to
keep it up, and the Party
muſt avoid all violent Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and lie as much as
may be in Bed, or on a
Couch. <hi>Fabritius Hildanus</hi>
ſays, That ſome have been
cured of great Ruptures by
lying in Bed, when they
could be cured no other
way.</p>
                  <p>The Oyl of it, made in
the following manner, is
full as good for Wounds
and Ulcers as that of
<hi>St. John's-wort:</hi> Take one
handful of the Leaves,
pound them in a Stone-Mortar,
and boil them in a
Pint of Oyl of Olives 'till
they are dry; ſtrain it, and
keep it for uſe.</p>

commonly it has but one
Stalk, two or three Foot
high, and ſometimes much
higher. 'Tis round, hairy,
full of Pith, ſurrounded
with Leaves plac'd at a
diſtance alternately, above
an Hand in length. The
Leaves conſiſt, for the moſt
part, of four little Leaves,
wing'd on both ſides, and
much indented all about;
they have Veins, and are
hairy, but the Down is
not very conſpicuous; they
taſte a little acrid, and are
ſomewhat ſtyptick. The
Flowers ſmell ſweet; they
grow alternately to the
Shaft, in a long Series;
and upon the Top-branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
like an Ear of Corn.
They are of a Saffron-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
and are compos'd of
five Leaves; at the Baſis
of every Leaf there are
two Ears that embrace the
Stalk. The Root is black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh,

Taſte.</p>
                  <p>It cleanſes and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens

                  <p>The Powder of the dried

are like a Water-Pitcher.
To each Flower ſucceeds

                  <p>The Leaves, the Branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,

partly purge watery and

Flowers, when they are
green, are commonly pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,

Take of the Tops of the

Carduus-ſeed, each one

ten Grains; boyl

                  <p>The Decoction of dried

Apoplexy and Palſie. A

ſpeechleſs three Days, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd

of Black-Cherries; for
they are very Cephalick,
and do much ſtrengthen
the Muſcles of the Tongue
and the Spirits deſign'd for
their Uſe. The diſtill'd
Water of ſweet Black-Cherries
is much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended,
and us'd for Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren's
Convulſions. Take
an equal quantity of this
Water, and the Water of
Lime-tree-flowers: The
Doſe is, an Ounce, or two
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:59977:27"/>
Ounces, according to the
Age of the Child. Wines

of Cherries ſeveral Ways;
either by Diſtillation, or
Infuſion, or by mixing Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
with the Juice, and
fermenting it. In <hi>Italy</hi> they
prepare a Potion with freſh
Cherries, which they call
<hi>Maraſco;</hi> they drink it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it ferments: 'Tis ſold
there in Taverns in the
Summer-time, and is count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a good, cooling Liquor.
The Oyl drawn from the

to take Spots and Pimples
from the Skin, by anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

good for the Gout, and
Stone in the Kidnies and
Bladder. The Gum of
Cherries, diluted with
Wine, cures inveterate
Coughs, quickens the Sight,
and provokes Appetite:
'Tis counted alſo Lithon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triptick,

Some, when they eat great
quantities of Cherries, ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the Stones to prevent
Surfeits, which is a vulgar

with many tranſverſe Veins
ſticking on the Back, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended

Long hanging Buds pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede
the Fruit, having yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Tufts. The Cups are
prickly, and like a Bur;
within they are hairy, and
as ſoft as Silk: They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
two or three Nuts,
ſome but one, ending ſharp,
from a broad Baſis; they
are about an Inch long, flat
on one ſide, and bellying
out on the other, and are
in ſhape ſomething like the
Heart. The Nut is white,
ſolid and hard, ſweet and
palatable; eſpecially when
it is roaſted. It chiefly
grows on Mountains, and
Riſing Grounds. There
are Abundance of them in
<hi>Italy,</hi> where the People
that live on the Mountains
eat little elſe. They bud

and ſoon after flower. The
Fruit is ripe about the Lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

                  <p>The freſh Root being

in a Difficulty of Breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
an <hi>Aſthma,</hi> and an old

Supper, it helps Conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
It is alſo commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as an excellent Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative
againſt the Plague.
Being taken in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
it forces Urine, and
the Courſes. Half a Pint
of White-wine, wherein
the ſlic'd Roots have been
infus'd three Days, taken
in the Morning faſting,
cures the Green-ſickneſs.
A Decoction of the Root,
taken inwardly, or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
applied, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
by ſome for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions,
Contuſions, and
the Hip-Gout. The Roots
boyl'd in Wine, or the freſh
Juice infus'd in it, and
drunk, kills and expels
Worms. Wine that is eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
where prepar'd with
this Root in <hi>Germany,</hi> and
often drunk, wonderfully
quickens the Sight. Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>campane
diſtill'd in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Water, yields a Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
Salt, that ſmells, and
has the ſame Virtue with
Salt of Hartſ-horn. Take

well cleans'd from

pleaſe; boyl them in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
till they are ſalt, and
pulp them through a Sieve;
whereof take one Part, and
of Hony two Parts; boyl
them to the Conſumption

a Preſervative againſt the
Plague. Take of the Roots

of the Flowers of Sulphure

does much good. Some

of an Old Man, who,

teaches the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern

beat with Lard, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to the Soles of the

Breath will ſtink of it; but
the Vapours penetrating
the Habit of the Body, do
not occaſion that Stink;

and better taſted; and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it Diuretick. Beer
purges the Blood, is good
in the Jaundice, and for
Hypochondriack Diſeaſes:
But whether it expels Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel,
or generates it, is
much diſputed by ſome:
They that commend it for
the Stone, argue from its
being hot and Diuretick:
They that condemn the uſe
of it in the Stone, ſay, that
it makes the Fits worſe;
and that Ale, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
mitigates the Pain.
Beſides, they ſay that the
Stone is much increas'd in
<hi>England</hi> ſince the uſe of
Hops. But I agree with
thoſe that approve and
commend the uſe of it in
Beer; for the Beer is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
render'd more agreeable
to the Stomach, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motes
the Concoction of
the Meat the better. Nor
does it avail any thing,
that Phyſicians forbid the
uſe of Beer in the Stone,
and preſcribe Ale; for they
do ſo only to leſſen the
Pain; for which Intention
Ale is very proper, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of its Smoothneſs; but
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:59977:57"/>
it does no way conduce to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Eradicating the
Diſeaſe, or Removing the
Cauſe; but rather pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motes
the Growth of it,
by its being clammy, and
apt to ſtick to it: And
it plainly appears by

on the Bills of Mortality,
that fewer die of the Stone,

ſhakes off Sleep and Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and chears and
ſtrengthens the Heart. It
concocts the Crude Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
of the Breaſt, and
opens the Lungs, and frees
them from Obſtructions:
And it is ſuch an effectual
Remedy for the Breaſt and
Lungs, that it ſometimes
revives Conſumptive Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
when they are, in a

frequently uſed in Faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
for Apoplexies, in the

of the Liver, in the
Plague, and other Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
Diſeaſes. 'Tis alſo
good in an <hi>Aſthma,</hi> mix'd

provokes Urine, and the

was preſcrib'd by

two Drams, diſſolv'd in
two Ounces of the <hi>Aqua la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis
alexiter;</hi> ſtrain it, and
add three Drams of Oyl of
Almonds: Give half in the
Morning, and the reſt three
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:59977:106"/>
Hours after, if it do not
work. Bitter Almonds are
hot and dry; they attenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate,
open and cleanſe; they
are Diuretick; they open
the Obſtructions of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
Spleen, Meſentery and
Womb. Outwardly uſed,
they take off Freckles. The
Oyl of Bitter Almonds is
more agreeable to the Ears,
than any other Oyl. The
<hi>Italians</hi> eat Almonds whole,
before the Stones are hard,
for Second Courſe; and
they taſte very pleaſantly,
and are very agreeable to
the Stomach. They grow
in <hi>Germany, Italy,</hi> and
<hi>France.</hi>

                     <hi>Aloes,</hi> in Latin <hi>Aloe.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>There are three ſorts of it,
<hi>viz.</hi> Succotrine, Hepatick,
and Caballine. Succotrine
is ſo called, from the Iſland
<hi>Succotra</hi> in <hi>India.</hi> This
ſort is the beſt of all; 'tis
clear and tranſparent, and
colour'd ſomewhat like the
Liver. It has an Aroma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Smell, like Myrrh;
upon which Account it was
formerly mix'd with Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes.
It has a bitter,
an Aromatick, and an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtringent
Taſte. 'Tis light,
and yet the Subſtance of it
is compact. Being handled
in the Sun, or near the Fire,
it grows ſoft; and when it
is cold it breaks eaſily:
Which are the Signs of the
beſt Aloes. The Hepatick
is ſo called, it being like
the Liver in Colour and
Conſiſtence. 'Tis not ſo
pure as the former, it is not
tranſparent, it ſmells ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and taſtes more bitter,
and is more aſtringent.
The <hi>Caballina</hi> is more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure,
ſandy, and filthy;
and fit only for Horſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aloes,</hi> beſides its Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Virtue, is hot and dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and opens Obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
It purges Choler and
Flegm. Aloes, contrary al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
to all other Purging
Medicines, ſtrengthens the
Stomach. But it is to be
noted, That the frequent
uſe of Aloes opens the Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrhoidal
Veins; and, to
be ſure, it has a Faculty of
opening the Orifices of the
Veins: Wherefore thoſe
that are ſubject to Haemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhages
muſt not uſe it.
<hi>Bartholinus</hi> mentions an
Obſervation of one that
render'd a Bloody Urine,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:59977:106"/>
by taking Aloes too often.
But, outwardly applied, it
is very aſtringent. Aloes
kill and expel Worms: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
mix'd with Vinegar,
and the Gall of an Ox,
and applied to the Navel,
it does the ſame. It cures
the Jaundice, and prevents
Putrefaction. And, mix'd
with Myrrh, it preſerves
dead Bodies a long time
from Corruption. Some
think the Virtue of Mum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
proceeds wholly from
the Aloes, wherewith Bodies
were wont to be embalm'd.
The Powder of Aloes, uſed
outwardly, ſtops the Flux
of the Haemorrhoidal Veins.
Diſſolv'd in Wine, it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
the Falling of the
Hair. Mix'd with Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines
for the Eyes, called
<hi>Collyria,</hi> it quickens the
Sight. Mix'd with Hony,
it cures Ulcers of the Privy
Parts, and a Fiſtula, and
Sore Mouths and a Stink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Breath. It ſhuts the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifices
of the Veins, and ſo
ſtops Bleeding. Outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
applied, it thickens and
dries; and the Powder
of it conglutinates freſh
Wounds, and skins them
ſoon. In preſcribing Aloes,
the following Cautions are
to be obſerv'd. Firſt, It is
not to be given to thoſe,
whoſe Diſeaſes proceed on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from a ſimple Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
without Matter; for
ſuch do not want Evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
nor a Medicine that is
ſo drying; for, inſtead of
Evacuation, it occaſions a
Conſumption in ſuch: But,
on the contrary; 'tis uſed
with very good Succeſs in
thoſe that are of a cold and
moiſt Conſtitution. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
It ought not to be
preſcrib'd to Old People.
Thirdly: It ought not to be
uſed too frequently; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
not daily, as ſome
order it. And Fourthly, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
with Child muſt not
take it; for it provokes
the Courſes powerfully.
Thoſe things which are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for the Correction of
it are, Mace, Nutmegs,
Cloves, Cinnamon, Spike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard,
Sweet-ſmelling Flag,
Saffron, and the like. The
Operation of it is quicken'd
by waſhing it in a Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Rhubarb, or in an
Infuſion of Roſes. 'Tis
ſaid, that Maſtick, Traga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canth,
Bdellium, and the
like, mix'd with it, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:59977:107"/>
its opening the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
of the Veins: Or, if
it be waſh'd in Endive, or
Succory-water, the ſame
may be prevented. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

and cured Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Eyes; and for
that being put upon Burns,
it ſeem'd as cold as Snow.
But Modern Phyſicians af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
'tis hot, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary:
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:59977:117"/>
Their Arguments
for it are, the great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammability
of it; its pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating,
Aromatick Smell,
and Acrid Taſte; its rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs
to evaporate, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the Tenuity of Parts.
Which Opinion, indeed,
ſeems moſt probable; for
the contrary Arguments are
eaſily anſwer'd. For, if it
ſhould be granted that it
ſuppreſſes Venery, it doth
not therefore neceſſarily
follow that it is cold; for
ſo doth Rue, and the chaſte
Tree, and the like. Yet
<hi>Breynius</hi> ſaith, it doth not
extinguiſh Venery: For,
ſays he, it hath been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd,
that many who have
been employ'd in purifying
Camphir daily, have had
many Children. And then,
tho' it be of uſe in many
Diſeaſes that require Cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as, in Inflammations
of the Eys, and Eryſipelas,
Fevers, and the like; yet
they ſay, Cooling in theſe

not <hi>per ſe,</hi> but <hi>per acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens;</hi>
much in the ſame
manner as the Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a Member burnt is
drawn out by the Heat of
the Fire, or the Flame of
a Candle, or, as by the
immoderate uſe of Pepper,
the native Heat is driven
out, and is leſs within;
and ſo the Body becomes
cold. Some mention other
Ways whereby theſe things
may be perform'd; which
I omit, partly becauſe they
are not ſatisfactory, and
partly becauſe it is not
clear, whether Camphir
doth good in theſe Diſeaſes,
or whether it be injurious.
Camphir reſiſts Putrefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and Poiſons; upon
which Account it is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
uſed in the Plague,
Malignant Diſeaſes, and
Putrid Fevers. Balm-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
wherein Camphir hath
been extinguiſh'd, doth
good in Mother-fits. 'Tis
moſt frequently uſed out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly,
in cooling Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thems,
Frontals, and Pare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goricks:
And for the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it with them, 'tis
wont to be diſſolv'd with
the Spirit of Wine, or rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed

and ſwims upon the
top of the Spirit, in form
of an Oyl. Camphir is
mix'd with Waſh-balls, to
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:59977:118"/>
ſmoothen and beautifie the
Skin. A ſmall quantity of
it uſed outwardly or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly,
diſpoſes to Sleep:
But if it be held to the
Noſe frequently, it dries
the Brain, and cauſes
Watching. Camphir is
reckon'd by the moſt learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Men, and not undeſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly,
among the ſtrongeſt
Alexipharmicks. It won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
reſiſts Putrefaction,
and repels and corrects the
putrid Vapours of a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Member: But it is to
be uſed cautiouſly in vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Pains of the Head and
Stomach. Camphir is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
in Spirit of Wine;
and this Diſſolution is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Spirit of Wine Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoriz'd.
'Tis good for
the Apoplexy, and Hyſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical
Diſeaſes. 'Tis alſo
found to be of excellent
uſe for the Tooth-ach, a
little Cotton being dip'd
in it, and put into the ach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Tooth. The Oyl of
Camphir is made in the
following manner: Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
groſly three or four
Ounces of good Camphir,
put it into a Matraſs, and
pour upon it twice as
much Spirit of Nitre; ſtop
your Veſſel cloſe, and ſet
it over a Pot half full of
Water, a little heated;
ſtir it ever now and then,
to help forward the Diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
which will be fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd
in two or three
Hours, and then you will
find the Camphir turn'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a clear Oyl, which ſwims
above the Spirit; ſeparate
it, and keep it in a Viol
well ſtop'd. 'Tis uſed for
the Caries of Bones, and
to touch Nerves that are
uncover'd in Wounds. This
Oyl is nothing but a Diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of Camphir in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Nitre; for if you
pour Water upon it, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
the force of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
it returns into Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phir,
as before. Of all the
Reſins, this is the only one
that can diſſolve in Spirit
of Wine. Take of Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
Salt of Hart's-horn two
Grains, of the Majeſterial
Cardiac-powder ſix Grains,
of Camphir and Cochinel,
each four Grains; of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi>-Treacle
one Scruple,
of the <hi>Aqua Coeleſtis</hi> a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
quantity: Make a
Bolus. This is good in
Malignant Fevers. Take
of Camphir and Borax,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:59977:118"/>
each one Dram; of White
Sugar-candy five Drams,
of White Vitriol one Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
powder them very
fine, and mingle them by
degrees with half a Pint of
Sweet-Fennel-water. This
is an excellent Water for
Rheums and Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Eyes, a Rag
being dip'd in it, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
often on the Eye-lids.
'Tis gather'd from more
Trees than one. It diſtils,
Drop by Drop, from a
great Tree, much like a
Walnut-tree, in the Iſland
<hi>Borneo,</hi> in <hi>Aſia.</hi> Little
Cakes of it are likewiſe
brought out of <hi>China,</hi> but
that is not ſo good. It
muſt be choſen white,
tranſparent, clean, friable,
without Spot, and ſuch as
is hard to quench when
once lighted. Camphir is
compounded of a Sulphur
and a Salt; ſo very Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile,
that it is very hard to
keep any time; and it
always loſeth ſomething,
let it be never ſo cloſely
ſtop'd.</p>

from the Leaves'
Oyl of Cloves; from the

of Juniper, mix'd with a

Cloves. Of theſe is boyl'd
up a fat, thick Oyl, like
Wax, fit to make Plaſters,

of the Root given in a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction,

The Bark of the Twigs

'Tis very good in all
Paralytick Diſeaſes, being
uſed outwardly in time.
'Tis a preſent Remedy for
the Gout, preſently aſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
the violent Pain of the
Parts, as ſoon as they are
anointed with it. It doth
alſo good, taken inwardly.
'Tis alſo of excellent uſe,
taken inwardly, for curing
an <hi>Aſthma,</hi> and other Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes

alſo good to correct the
Malignity of Fevers. It
forces Sweat; and is very

of Cinnamon, and its Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therial-water,
is made in

Bruiſe four Pounds of good
Cinnamon, and infuſe it in

leave it in digeſtion in an

two Days; pour the Infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion

Limbeck, and fitting a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver
to it, and luting cloſe
the Junctures with a wet
Bladder, diſtil with a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
good Fire three or four
Pints of the Liquor; then
unlute the Limbeck, and
pour into it by Inclination
the diſtil'd Waters; you
will find at bottom a little
Oyl, which you muſt pour
into a Viol, and ſtop it
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:59977:124"/>
cloſe; diſtil the Liquor as

Water into the Limbeck,
take the Oyl you find at

and mix it with the firſt:
Repeat this Cohobation,
until there riſes no more
Oyl; then take away the
Fire. Tincture of Cinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

manner: Take what
quantity of bruiſed Cinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

Matraſs cloſe, and ſet it in
Digeſtion in Horſe-dung
four or five Days; the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

with the Tincture
of Cinnamon, and become
red; ſeparate it from the
Cinnamon, and after it is
filtrated, keep the Tincture
in a Viol well ſtop'd. 'Tis
an admirable Cardiack; it
fortifies the Stomach, and
rejoyces all the Vital Parts.
It may be uſed like Cinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-water,

ſmaller Doſe. Cinnamon-water
is made in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
manner: Take of
bruiſed Cinnamon a Pound
and an half, <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wine
a Quart; infuſe the Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namon

four Hours, then diſtil
them in a Limbeck; draw
off three Pints of Strong-water,
ſweeten'd with Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,

for which Reaſon the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi>
Women frequently
chew them, and ſuch like
things. They are ſaid to
clear the Sight, and to take
off Clouds from the Eyes.
They ſtrengthen the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
and take off Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting
and Nauſeouſneſs.
They provoke Venery, and
are good for all cold Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes
of the Brain; as, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poplexies,
Lethargies, Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,
or the like. They are
uſed to correct the Air, by
being burnt or eaten. But
the chief uſe of them is in
the Kitchin, for Sauces, and
the like. They are alſo uſed
to perfume Clothes, an
Orange being ſtuck full of
them, and put into the
Cheſt to the Clothes.
Some put them into Wine
or Beer, and they impart
to it a pleaſant Smell and
Taſte. They are put into
a Bag, or ſow'd up in a
Cloth, and worn upon the
Stomach, to ſtop Vomiting,
and to take off Pains of the
Stomach, proceeding from
a cold Cauſe. Some pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their Heads with the
Powder of them, to take
off Dulneſs and Pains of
the Head. Cloves candied,
taſte very pleaſantly, and
are proper for a cold Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach.
Oyl of Cloves by
Diſtillation is good for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
and outward uſe.
Oyl of Cloves, <hi>per deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum,</hi>
is made in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
manner. Take ſeveral
large Drinking-glaſſes, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
them with a Linnen
Cloth, and tie it round
each of them, leaving a
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:59977:126"/>
Cavity in each Cloth, to
put the powder'd Cloves
into; ſet a ſmall Earthen
Cup upon each Glaſs of
theſe Cloves, let it ſtop ſo
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>ly, that it may ſuffer no
Air to enter between its
Brim and that of the Glaſs;
fill the Cups with hot Aſhes,
to warm the Cloves, and
diſtil down to the bottom
of the Glaſſes firſt a little
Flegm and Spirit, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that a clear and white
Oyl; continue the Fire,
until there falls no more;
ſeparate the Oyl in a Tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
lined with a Cornet of
Brown Paper, and keep it
in a Viol well ſtop'd.
Some Drops of it are, with
Cotton, put into aching
Teeth. 'Tis likewiſe good
in Malignant Fevers, and
the Plague. The Doſe is
two or three Drops in
Balm-water, or ſome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate
Liquor. You
muſt mix it with a little
Sugar-candy, or a little
Yolk of an Egg, before
you drop it into the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
otherwiſe it will not
diſſolve in the Water. I
have given you this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,
to ſerve upon
an Emergency, when you
want, in haſte, the Oyl of
Cloves. You muſt only uſe
hot Aſhes to warm the
Cloves, if you deſire White
Oyl; for, if you give a
greater Heat, the Oyl turns
red; and beſides, a great
part of it will be loſt. You
muſt alſo take care to lift
up the Cup from time to
time, to ſtir about the
Powder. Some do diſſolve
Opium in Oyl of Cloves,
and uſe this Diſſolution for
the Tooth-ach; they put
one Drop of it into the ach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Tooth and it ſoon
takes off the Pain. The
Spirit of Cloves, which
is made at the ſame time
the Oyl is made, is a good
Stomachick: It helps Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction,
comforts the Heart,
and increaſes Seed. The
Doſe is, from ſix Drops to
twenty, in ſome convenient
Liquor. Cloves grow ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneouſly
in the <hi>Moloca</hi>-Iſlands.
Thoſe that are
good are black, ſolid and
weighty, ſmell well, are
hard to break, and bite
the Tongue much; and
when they are broken
their Liquor ſweats out.
They may be kept five
Years in a temperate place.</p>

But it is moſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
notice of for removing
Drowſineſs. But tho it be
ſo commonly uſed, and ſo
very proper and effectual
in ſome Caſes; yet in other
Caſes perhaps it may be
hurtful, or, at leaſt, not ſo
beneficial: For it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
obſerv'd, that Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fee-drinkers
are often very
lean, and become Parali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,
and impotent as to
Venery. But, indeed, in
moſt Diſeaſes of the Head,
as, for Giddineſs, Head-aches,
Lethargies, Catarrhs,
and the like, Coffee is often
uſed with good Succeſs by
thoſe that are of a groſs
Habit of Body, and of a
cold Conſtitution, and
whoſe Blood is watery,
their Brains moiſt, and
their Animal Spirits dull;
for, being taken daily, it
wonderfully clears the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
and diſſipates thoſe
Clouds of all the Functions.
But on the contrary, they
who are of a thin Habit
of Body, and an hot and

ought, by all means, to
forbear Coffee. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
thoſe that have but

not to drink Coffee, tho'

reckon'd good in a Scorbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick

The Goodneſs of Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fee

                     </gap>hen are beſt for it, for
it is probable that Metals

a Pound of good clean
Coffee, the Veſſels being
well luted, hath yielded
four Ounces and an half of

Oyl, which being rectified,

Upon which, we may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably
conjecture, that
Coffee contains many Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
that are Volatile and
Penetrative; whereby it is
probable it keeps Men wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.
Many that have

uſed inoffenſively, being
boyl'd to a Syrup with Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
and Vinegar; and are
very uſeful for many Fleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick
Diſeaſes, eſpecially
of the Breaſt and Head;
as, an <hi>Aſthma,</hi> Difficulty of
Breathing, and the Falling-ſickneſs.
They wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
purge the Belly, the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,
and all the Paſſages.
In the Uſe of White Helle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore
two Things are chiefly
to be minded: Firſt, That
the Diſeaſes are very obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate:
And Secondly, That
the Patient hath ſufficient
Strength to bear the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
Wherefore the Root
ought not to be given to
Old Men, Women, or
Children, or to ſuch as are
weakly, and coſtive in the
Body: And the Hellebore
ought to be well prepar'd.
The old Way of giving of
it was, with Horſe-Radiſh,
which they uſed three
Ways; for, either they
ſtuck the Roots into Horſe-Radiſh,
and continu'd them
in it twenty four Hours;
and afterwards, the Roots
being taken out, they gave
the Horſe-Radiſh: Or they
infus'd the Horſe-Radiſh,
ſtuck with the Roots, in
Oxymel, in <hi>B. M.</hi> and gave
only the Oxymel: Or, they
left the Horſe-Radiſh ſo
prepar'd all Night, and in
the Morning infus'd it in
Oxymel, having firſt caſt
away the Hellebore; and
then they gave the Oxymel.
But <hi>Parkinſon</hi> ſays, the beſt
Way of preparing it is, to
infuſe it in the Juice of
Quinces; or to roaſt it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Aſhes, in a Quince.
If, upon taking Hellebore,
there is danger of Suffoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the eating of Quinces,
or the taking the Juice or
Syrup of it, is a preſent
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:59977:134"/>
Remedy. The Root boyl'd
in Vinegar, and retain'd a
while in the Mouth, takes
off the Pain of the Teeth.
A Decoction of it made in
Lee kills Lice, aad cleanſes
the Head from Scurf, it
being waſh'd with it: And
mix'd with ſome Ointment,
it does the ſame, and cures
the Itch, and other Vices
of the Skin. Made up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Paſte, it kills ſeveral
Animals; as, Moles, Mice,
Weaſlles, Birds, and the
like. The Powder of it
blown up into the Noſtrils,
occaſions Sneezing; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is called in Engliſh
Sneez-wort. <hi>Parkinſon</hi> ſays,
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> make a Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the Juice of the
Root, being fermented in
an Earthen Pot; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
they anoint their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows,
that the Wounds in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
by them may be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
incurable. 'Tis very
ſtrange that this Poyſon ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
into the Body ſhould
not be deadly, and yet that
the Wound touch'd with it
ſhould be ſo. But the ſame
may be ſaid of the Poyſon
of Vipers; which being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
inwardly, occaſions no
deadly Symptoms; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
mix'd with the Blood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
through the Orifice of a
Wound, or Puncture, ſoon
kills, unleſs the Party is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
reliev'd by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Remedies. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
both Hellebores
were formerly uſed for Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
and Mad People,
and now they are only uſed
in great Diſeaſes; as, for
the Falling-ſickneſs, Giddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
Madneſs, Dropſie,
Hip Gout, Convulſions, and
the like. The Extract of
Hellebore of the <hi>London-Diſpenſatory</hi>
is made in the
following manner: Take
of the Roots of White Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebore
cut one Pound, of
Fountain-water ſix Quarts;
infuſe them three Days,
then boyl it half away,
and preſs it out ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
to the ſtrain'd Liquor
add three Pounds of Hony,
and boyl it to the Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence
of Hony, and keep
it in a Glaſs for uſe. It
grows in hilly and rough
Grounds, not only in
<hi>Greece,</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hot Countries, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo

to ſtrong People. There is
leſs danger in the Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction

with Maſtich, Cinnamon,

that Black Hellebore, right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prepar'd, is a very inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Medicine; and that it
may be given to Women
and Children, and to weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
People. The Doſe of it,
in ſubſtance, is, from fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Grains to half a Dram,

take a Dram. 'Tis given
in Infuſion, or Decoction,
from a Dram to two Drams.

<hi>Hartman</hi> commends, for an

noted, that they who are
of a hot Conſtitution ought
not to uſe it, whether they

Medicine better or ſurer
than the Decoction of
Guaiacum; for, if the
Cure be manag'd as it
ought, and the Decoction
be taken in due time, 'tis a
certain Cure for this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe.
'Tis alſo good in a
Dropſie, for an Aſthma,
the Falling-ſickneſs, for Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes
of the Bladder and
Reins, and for Pains in the
Joints, and for all Diſeaſes
proceeding from cold Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors
and Wind. The <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
learnt the uſe of it
from the <hi>Indians:</hi> For, a
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:59977:138"/>
certain <hi>Spaniard</hi> having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the Diſeaſe from an
<hi>Indian</hi> Woman, was much
afflicted with Venereal
Pains; and having an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi>
Servant who practis'd
Phyſick in that Province,
he gave his Maſter the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction
of it, whereby his
Pains were eaſed, and his
Health reſtored: And by
his Example, many other
<hi>Sapniards</hi> were cured. So
that, in a ſhort time, this
way of Cure was known
all over <hi>Spain;</hi> and ſoon
after, every where elſe.
The Pox, that is the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe
of the <hi>Weſt-Indians,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>infected
the <hi>Europeans</hi> in
the following manner: In
the Year 1493. in that War
of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> at <hi>Naples,</hi>
with the <hi>French, Columbus</hi>
return'd from his firſt Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
which he had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
for the Diſcovery of
the New World; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
found ſome Iſlands,
he brought thence Men
and Women to <hi>Naples,</hi>
where His Catholick Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
was. Having then
made Peace with the <hi>French</hi>
King, both the Armies ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
free Intercourſe, and
Ingreſs, and Egreſs, at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had firſt
Converſation with the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi>
Women, and the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi>
Men with the <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Women: And then it crept
afterwards into <hi>Italy</hi> and
<hi>Germany,</hi> and laſtly into
<hi>France,</hi> and ſo over all the
World. At firſt it had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Names: The <hi>Spaniards</hi>
thinking they were infected
by the <hi>French,</hi> called it the
<hi>French</hi>-Pox: The <hi>French</hi>
ſuppoſing they got it at
<hi>Naples,</hi> called it the <hi>Neopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litan</hi>
Diſeaſe: And the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
thinking they receiv'd
it from the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
it the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Diſeaſe:
But others more properly
termed it the <hi>Indian</hi> Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
for from thence it firſt
came. The Way of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
this Decoction, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the Method of
taking it, is as follows:
Take of the Wood cut
ſmall twelve Ounces, of
the Bark of it beaten two
Ounces; infuſe it in ſix
Sextaries of Water, in a
large Earthen Pot, twenty
four Hours; the Pot muſt
be cloſe ſtop'd; boyl it
with a gentle Fire, to the
Conſumption of four Sex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries
of the Water; when
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:59977:139"/>
it is cold ſtrain it, then put
upon the ſame Wood eight
Sextaries of Water, and
boyl it to the Conſumption
of two: Keep it a-part.
The Way of giving it is as
follows: The Sick being
purged according as his
Phyſician ſhall think fit, he
muſt be put into a warm
Chamber, and let him go
to bed in the Morning, and
take ten Ounces of the firſt
Water hot; and being well
cover'd, he muſt ſweat two
Hours; then, being well
rub'd, let him change his
Linnen, and put on his
Clothes well warm'd; four
Hours after give him Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins
and Almonds, with
Bread twice baked, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
let him eat moderately,
and drink as much as is
ſufficient of the Second
Water: Eight Hours after
he hath eaten, let him take
again ten Ounces of the
firſt Water hot, and let
him ſweat two Hours, and
be cleanſed from his Sweat
as before; an Hour after
the Sweat, give him the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds
and Raiſins, and the
Bread twice bak'd for his
Supper, and let him drink
of the Second Water. Let
him obſerve this Method
for the firſt fifteen Days,
unleſs his Strength be much
impair'd; for if ſo, he muſt
be allow'd a roaſted Chic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
beſides the things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-mention'd:
Thoſe that
are weakly, and cannot bear
ſo ſtrict a Diet, muſt be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
alſo a roaſted Chic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
after nine Days: But
if the Sick be ſo very weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that he cannot bear at
all the fore-mention'd Diet,
he muſt eat Chicken ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly
at the Beginning, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing
his Meals by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.
After fifteen or ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Days, purge with ten
Drams of the Pulp of Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,
or ſome ſuch Medicine,
and on the ſame Day let
him drink of the Second
Decoction: On the Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
Day let him return
to the Method above de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd;
let him take,
Morning and Evening, the
Water of the Firſt Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
ſweat, and be diet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as before; only, inſtead
of a Chicken, let him eat
half a Pullet; and towards
the End, ſomewhat more:
Let him continue the ſame
Diet to the Twentieth Day,
at which time, being well
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:59977:139"/>
cloath'd, let him walk a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
his Chamber; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
purge him again,
and let him continue the
uſe of the Decoction forty
Days more, and let him
obſerve an orderly Diet,
and abſtain from Women
and Wine: But if he nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeate
the Decoction, let
him drink Water wherein
Anniſe and Fennel have
been boyl'd; let him eat a
ſmall Supper, and, to be
ſure, let him forbear Fleſh
then. This Method, ſome
think, will eradicate the
worſt ſort of Pox: But o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
hold, there is no other
Way of curing it, when it
is deeply rooted, than by
the uſe of Mercury. The
incomparable Chyrurgeon,
Mr. <hi>Wiſeman,</hi> mentions it
frequently in his excellent
Treatiſe of the French-Pox.
Take of Guaiacum four
Ounces, of the Bark of the
ſame two Ounces, of Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaparilla
eight Ounces, of
the Wood of Saxifrage one
Ounce and an half, of the
Shavings of Hart's-horn
and Ivory, each ſix Drams;
infuſe them all Night in
ten Quarts of Fountain-water,
then boyl them in a
Veſſel cloſe ſtop'd, to the
Conſumption of a third
part; add at the End, of
the Leaves and Roots of
Soap-wort two Handfuls,
of the Leaves of Agrimony,
and both the Speed-wells,
each one Handful; of Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins
ſtoned ſix Ounces; of
the Seeds of Sweet Fennel
and Coriander, each ſix
Drams; of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Liquo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
two Ounces; ſtrain
the Liquor, and aromatize
it with a little Cinnamon,
and keep it for uſe: The
Patient commonly takes a
Quart, or more, of this
Drink in a Day. Take of
the Leaves of Sena four
Ounces, of Gummy Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bith
and Hermodactyls,
each two Ounces; of Black
Hellebore, and the Pulp of
Colloquintida, each ſix
Drams; of Guaicum and
Saxifrage raſp'd, each one
Ounce; of the Bark of
Guaiacum, and the freſh
Berries of Juniper, and
the outward Bark of
Citrons, each half an
Ounce; of Cinnamon and
Cloves, each two Drams;
infuſe them in equal Parts
of the Waters of Balm,
Meadow-ſweet, and <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duus
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:59977:140"/>
Benedictus,</hi> for the
ſpace of forty eight Hours;
then boyl them gently, and
ſtrain out the Liquor; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
in it, of Aloes-Roſat
two Ounces, Diagridium
one Ounce; bring it to the
Conſiſtence of an Extract,
and keep it for uſe: The
Doſe is, from half a Dram
to one Dram. This is a
proper Purge in the <hi>French</hi>
Diſeaſe. Or, Take of the
Extract above deſcrib'd
two Drams, of the Gum of
Guaiacum half a Scruple,
of <hi>Mercurius dulcis</hi> one Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
make Pills with the
Syrup of Buck-thorn: Theſe
Pills are alſo uſed for the
ſame Diſeaſe. Diſtillation
of Guaiacum is perform'd
in the following manner:
Take the Shavings of Guai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acum,
fill a large Retort
with them, three quarters
full; place it in a Rever-beratory
Furnace, and joyn
to it a great capacious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver;
begin the Diſtilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with a Fire of the Firſt
Degree, to warm the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort
gently, and to diſtil
the Water which is called
Flegm; continue it in this
condition until there come
no more Drops, which is a
Sign that all the Flegm is
come; throw away that
which you find in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver,
and fitting it again
to the Neck of the Retort,
lute well the Junctures;
you muſt afterwards in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
the Fire by degrees,
and the Spirits and Oyl
will come forth in white
Clouds; continue the Fire
until there comes no more;
let the Veſſels cool, and
unlute them; pour that
which is in the Receiver
into a Tunnel lined with
Brown Paper, and, ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a Bottle, or ſome other
Veſſel; the Spirit will paſs
through, and leave the
black, thick, and very fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tid
Oyl in the Tunnel;
pour it into a Viol, and
keep it for uſe. 'Tis an
excellent Remedy for Rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenneſs
of the Bones, for
the Tooth-ach, and to
cleanſe old Ulcers. It may
be rectified, and may be
uſed inwardly for the Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-ſickneſs
and Palſie, and
to drive forth the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth:
The Doſe is, from
two Drops to ſix, in ſome
convenient Liquor. The
Spirit of Guaicum may be
rectified in a Limbeck, to
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:59977:140"/>
ſeparate the Impurity that
paſſes with it: It works by
Perſpiration, and by Urine:
The Doſe is, from half a
Dram to a Dram and an
half. 'Tis likewiſe uſed,
mix'd with Water of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
to cleanſe Inveterate
Ulcers. You will find in
the Retort the Coals of
Guaiacum, which you may
turn into Aſhes by putting
Fire to them: Calcine theſe
Aſhes ſome Hours in a Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's
Furnace, then make a
Lee of them with Water,
filtrate it, and evaporate it
in a Glaſs, or Earthen Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,
in Sand, there will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
the Salt of Guaia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum;
which you may
make white by calcining it
in a Crucible, in a ſtrong
Fire. This Salt is Aperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
and Sudorifick; it
may ſerve, as all other Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kalies,
to draw the Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
of Vegetables: The
Doſe is, from ten Grains
to half a Dram, in ſome
convenient Liquor. During
the Diſtillation you muſt
not make the Fire too
ſtrong; for the Spirits com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forth with a great deal
of Violence, will be apt to
break either the Retort or
the Receiver. Tho' Guai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acum
be a very dry Body,
yet abundance of Liquor is
drawn from it; for, if you
put into the Retort four
Pounds of this Wood, ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Ounces to the Pound,
you will draw thirty nine
Ounces of Spirit and Flegm,
and five Ounces and an
half of Oyl; there will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
in the Retort nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Ounces of Coals, from
which you may draw half
an Ounce, or ſix Drams of
an Alkali-Salt. The Oyl
of Guaiacum is Acrimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
by reaſon of the Salts
it has carried along with it;
and it is the Gravity of the
Salts that does precipitate
it to the bottom of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
This Oyl does good
for the Tooth-ach, becauſe
it ſtops the Nerves with its
Ramous Parts; hindring
thereby the Air from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring.
Moreover, by means
of the Acrimonious Salts
which they contain, they
do diſſipate a Flegm, which
uſes to get within the Gum,
and cauſes Pain. Take of
Guaiacum, cut into ſmall
pieces, eight Ounces; of
Sarſaparilla ſix Ounces, of
the Bark of Walnut-tree,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:59977:141"/>
of the Roots of Fig-wort,
and of Saxifrage, each two
Ounces; Herb <hi>Robert</hi> three
Handfuls, of Raiſins of the
Sun ſtoned, and of Live
Millepedes, each one Pound;
make a Bag for four Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons
of New Beer. This
is a Diet-drink for the
King's Evil. Guaiacum
grows in <hi>Hiſpaniola, Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica,</hi>
and ſome other
Places.</p>

and to diſſolve other hard
Swellings. Gum-Ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niack
is diſtill'd in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
manner: Put a
Pound of Gum-Ammoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack
into an Earthen Retort,
or a Glaſs one, luted, big
enough for two thirds to
remain empty; place this
Retort in a Reverberatory
Furnace, and fitting to it a
Receiver, begin the Diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
with a very little
Fire, to warm gently the
Retort, and drive forth,
Drop by Drop, a little Fleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick
Water; when the
Vapours begin to appear,
throw out that which is in
the Receiver; and re-fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
it, and luting cloſe the
Joints, increaſe the Fire by
degrees, and continue it
until all is come forth;
then let the Veſſels cool,
and unlute them; pour out
that which is in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver,
into a Tunnel lined
with Brown Paper; the
Spirit will paſs through,
and leave the thick, black
Oyl in the Filter: Keep it

<pb n="271" facs="tcp:59977:141"/>
Diſeaſes; the diſeas'd Parts
are rub'd with it: And it is
given Women to ſmell to.
Put the Spirit into a Glaſs-Limbeck,

not unpleaſant. 'Tis ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than the common White

A Dram of the Powder of
it may be given at a time.
The Purgative Quality re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
in the Reſin. Reſin,
or Magiſtery of <hi>Jalap</hi> is
made in the following man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:
Put a Pound of Jalap,
groſly powder'd, into a
large Matraſs; pour upon
it Spirit of Wine Alcoho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz'd,
until it be four Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
above the Matter;
ſtop the Matras with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
whoſe Neck enters
into it; and luting the Jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
with a wet Bladder,
digeſt it three Days in a
Sand-heat; the Spirit of
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:59977:147"/>
Wine will receive a red
Tincture, decant it, and
then pour more upon the
Jalap, proceed as before;
and mixing your Diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
filtrate them through
Brown Paper; put that
which you have filtrated
into a Glaſs-Cucurbite, and
diſtil in a Vaporous Bath
two thirds of the Spirit of
Wine, which may ſerve
you another time for the
ſame Operation; pour that
which remains at the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of the Cucurbite, into
a large Earthen Pan, fill'd
with Water, and it will
turn into a Milk, which
you muſt leave a Day to
ſettle, and then ſeparate
the Water by Inclination;
you will find the Reſin at
bottom, like unto Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine;
waſh it ſeveral times
with Water, and dry it in
the Sun, it will grow hard,
like common Reſin; pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it fine, and it will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
white; keep it in a
Viol. It purges Seroſities:
'Tis given in Dropſies, and
for all Obſtructions. The
Doſe is, from four to twelve
Grains, mix'd in an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary,
or elſe in Pills.
The Reſins of Turbith,
Scammony and Benjamin
may be drawn after the
ſame manner. If you uſe
ſixteen Ounces of Jalap,
you will draw an Ounce
and ſix Drams of Reſin.
You muſt obſerve to give
the Reſin of Jalap always
mix'd with ſomething elſe,
that may ſeparate its Parts;
for if it be taken alone, it
will be apt to adhere to the
Membrane of the Inteſtines<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and ſo cauſe Ulcers by
its Acrimonious Quality.
Moreover, Apothecaries
ſhould obſerve to mix it in
a little Yolk of an Egg,
when they would diſſolve
it in a Potion; for it ſticks
to the Mortar, like Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine,
when it is moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en'd
with any Aqueous Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor.
It may be likewiſe
incorporated with ſome E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuary,
and then it eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſſolves. Twelve Grains
of this Reſin work as much
as a Dram of Jalap in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance:
But I have always
obſerv'd in my Practice,
that the Powder of Jalap
works better and ſurer
than the Reſin. Take of
Lenetive Electuary two
Drams, of the Cream of
Tartar half a Dram, of
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:59977:147"/>
Powder of Jalap two Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples;
make a Bolus with a

Says he, (treating of

that proceed from Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuations,
and well weighing
the Matter, I ſuppos'd that
Jeſuit's-Powder would be the

indeed, I can truly affirm,
notwithſtanding the Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
of the Common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and of ſome few of the

any Injury by the uſe of it,

with a Scorbutick
Rheumatiſm, but this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
rarely; and when it
does, 'tis eaſily cured by
the following Medicines:
Take of Conſerve of freſh
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:59977:148"/>
Garden-Scurvy-graſs two
Ounces, of Wood-Sorrel
one Ounce, of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound-water
of Wake-Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin
ſix Drams; with a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
quantity of Syrup of

Take two Drams of it
three times a Day, for the
ſpace of a Month; drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon it ſix Spoonfuls
of the following Water:
Take of Garden-Scurvy-graſs
eight Handfuls; of
Water-creſſes, Brook-lime,
Sage and Mint, each four
Handfuls; the Bark of ſix
Oranges, of bruiſed Nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meg
half an Ounce; infuſe
them in ſix Quarts of <hi>Brunſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi>-Mum,
diſtil them in a
common Still, and draw off
three Quarts of Water. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
called to a Patient that
has a Quartan-Ague, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
for Inſtance, on a
<hi>Monday;</hi> and if the Fit be
to come that Day, I do
then nothing; only, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
the Patient, I tell
him he will have no more
Fits than that. To which
End, I give the Bark in the
following manner, on <hi>Tueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi>
and <hi>Wedneſday:</hi> Take
of Jeſuit's-powder one
Ounce, make an Electuary
with a ſufficient quantity of
Syrup of July-flowers, or
of dried Roſes, to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
into twelve Parts;
whereof, let him take one
every fourth Hour, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
preſently after the Fit
is off, drinking upon it a
Draught of any Wine. But
if the Patient can take Pills
beſt, Take of the Jeſuit's-powder
one Ounce, with a
ſufficient quantity of Syrup
of July-flowers, make Pills
of a moderate bigneſs;
whereof, let him take ſix
every fourth Hour. But it
is leſs troubleſome, and full
as good, that an Ounce of
this Powder be mingled
with a Quart of Claret, and
that eight or nine Spoonfuls
of it be taken at the ſame
times above-mention'd. On
<hi>Thurſday,</hi> which is the Fit-day,
I order nothing; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,
moſt commonly, no
Fit comes then; the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
of the Feveriſh Matter
being put off by the uſual
Sweats which come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the End of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
Fit, carry it off;
and the Proviſion for a new
Fit being intercepted by the
repeated Juice of the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
on the Days betwixt
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:59977:148"/>
the Fits. But<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> leſt the Ague
ſhould return again, eight
Days exactly from the time
wherein the Sick took the
laſt Doſe, I give the ſame
quantity of the Powder;
namely, an Ounce, divided
into twelve Parts, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Method above-deſcrib'd.
But tho' the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition
of it once does ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
often cure the Diſeaſe,
yet the Sick is not wholly
out of Danger, unleſs his
Phyſician repeat it the third
or the fourth time, at the
ſame diſtances above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd;
eſpecially if the
Blood has been weaken'd
by fore-going Evacuations,
or if the Patient has un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warily
expos'd himſelf to
the cold Air. But, tho'
this Remedy has no Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Quality in it, yet, by
reaſon of the peculiar Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of ſome Bodies, it often
happens, that the Sick is as
violently purg'd by the uſe
of it, as if he had taken
ſome ſtrong Purge: In this
Caſe it is neceſſary to give
Laudanum with it; and
therefore I order ten Drops
of Laudanum to be put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Wine, and to be taken
after every other Doſe of
the Powder, if the Looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
continues. The above-mention'd
Method cures al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
Quotidian and Tertian-Agues.
But tho' Tertian
and Quotidian-Agues ſeem
wholly to intermit after a
Fit or two, yet many times
they appear like Continual
Fevers; and there is only
Remiſſion of the Fever on
the Days the Fit ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termit;
eſpecially when
the Sick hath been kept a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
altogether, or has been
puniſh'd with an hot Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
and Medicines, that
are deſign'd to drive out
the Fever by Sweat. In
this Caſe we muſt lay hold
of the leaſt Remiſſion, and
give the Powder every
fourth Hour; left, whilſt
we attend on the Fit, there
ſhould not be time enough
for the Powder to work
upon the Blood. But ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there are ſome that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
take the Bark, neither
in the form of a Powder,
nor of an Electuary, or
Pills, I give to theſe an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion
of it made in the
Cold: I infuſe for ſome
time two Ounces of the
Bark, groſly powder'd, in
a Quart of Rheniſh-wine;
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:59977:149"/>
and four Ounces of the ſaid
Infuſion ſeems to contain
the Virtue of one Dram of
the Powder; and becauſe
it is not unpleaſant, nor
does oppreſs the Stomach,
it may be taken as often
again as any other Form of
this Medicine; namely, till
it has cured the Ague.
Sometimes it happens, that
before this Diſeaſe forms it
ſelf into Regular Fits, the
Sick, by reaſon of continual
Vomiting, cannot contain
the Bark in the Stomach,
in what Form ſoever it is
taken. In this Caſe, the
Vomiting muſt be firſt ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
before the Bark is
given: To which End I
order, that ſix or eight
times, in the ſpace of two
Hours, the Sick take one
Scruple of Salt of Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,
in one Spoonful of
the Juice of Limons freſh
preſs'd out; afterwards ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Drops of Liquid Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danum,
in a Spoonful of
ſtrong Cinnamon-water;
and ſoon after, if the Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting
be ſtop'd, let him
take the Jeſuit's-powder.
For Infants, whoſe tender
Age can ſcarce bear this
Remedy in any other Form,
at leaſt, ſo much of it as
may be ſufficient to cure
the Diſeaſe, I preſcribe the
following Julap: Take of
Black-Cherry-water and
Rheniſh-wine, each two
Ounces; of the Jeſuit's-powder
three Drams, of
Syrup of July-flowers one
Ounce; mingle them, and
make a Julap; give a Spoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
or two, according to the
Age of the Child, every
fourth Hour, till the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe
is cured; dropping in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
every other Doſe, if there
be a Looſneſs, a Drop or
two of Liquid Laudanum.
As to Diet, let the Sick eat
and drink what his Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach
craves, Summer-Fruits
and cold Liquors on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
excepted; and let him
drink Wine moderately,
for his ordinary Drink; by
which alone I have reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
ſome, whoſe Bodies,
by reaſon of the frequent
Returns of the Ague, have
always eluded the Saluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous
Virtue of the Bark.
The Diſeaſe being taken off,
all manner of Evacuations
are carefully to be avoided;
for the gentleſt Purge, nay,
a Clyſter only of Milk and
Sugar, will be apt to occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:59977:149"/>
a Relapſe. But this
excellent Bark does not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cure Agues, 'tis alſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
uſed, by the beſt
Phyſicians, for Continual
Fevers, in the Gout, and
for Hyſterick Diſeaſes, and
the Fever that accompanies
Conſumptions, commonly
called the Hectick Fever,
the Bark being given in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion,
and ſweeten'd with
Syrup of Rasberries. But
if, with an Hectick Fever,
the Conſumptive Patient
be alſo afflicted with a
Looſneſs, which commonly
ends the Tragedy, the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Pills are of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
uſe: Take of the Lem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian

of Bole-Armoniack twelve

one Dram and an half,

a ſufficient quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity;
make fourſcore Pills;
let him take five every ſix
Hours, during the Looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
dringing upon them
ſeven Spoonfuls of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Julap: Take of

twelve Ounces, of Cinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-water
hordeated three
Ounces, of Dr. <hi>Stephens</hi>'s
Water, and Epidemick-water,
each two Ounces;
of Diacodium three Oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
The following Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine

of the <hi>Peruvian</hi> Bark
is made in the following
manner: Put into a Bolt-head
four Ounces of good
Bark, groſly powder'd;
pour upon it Spirit of
Wine, four Fingers high
above the Matter; fit to
it another Matraſs, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to make a double Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel;
lute well the Jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:59977:150"/>
and place your Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
to digeſt in Horſe-dung,
or in a Vaporous Bath, four
Days; ſtir it from time to
time, the Spirit of Wine
will load it ſelf with a Red
Colour; unlute the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels,
filtrate the Tincture
through Brown Paper, and
keep it in a Viol well ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped.
'Tis a Febrifuge to
be given in Agues, three or
four times a Day, after the
Fit; and to be continued
for a Fortnight: The Doſe
is, from ten Drops to a
Dram, in ſome proper Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor;
as, in Centory-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
Juniper, Wormwood-Water
or Wine. If you
put new Spirit of Wine to
the Matter which remains
in the Matraſs, and ſet it
in Digeſtion, as before,
you will draw more Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
but it will not be ſo
ſtrong as the other; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you muſt give it in a
larger Doſe. Extract of
<hi>Peruvian</hi> Bark is made in
the following manner: Put
to infuſe warm twenty four
Hours eight Ounces of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruvian</hi>
Bark, in a ſufficient
quantity of diſtill'd Water
of Nuts; afterwards boyl
the Infuſion gently, and
ſtrain it, make a ſtrong Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
of the Reſidence,
put it to infuſe in new Water
of Nuts, boyl it and ſtrain
it as before; mix together
what you have ſtrain'd, let
them ſettle, and decant the
clear Liquor, and evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
it in a Glaſs, or Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
Veſſel, ſet in a Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heat,
unto the Conſiſtence
of thick Hony: It has the
ſame Virtues as the former.
The Doſe is, from twelve
Grains to half a Dram, in
Pills, or diſſolv'd in Wine.
Sir <hi>Robert Tabar</hi> was the
firſt that found out the true
Doſe or Quantity of it for
curing Agues; for he did
not ſtand upon Scruples,
but gave Drams and Oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of it; and ſo it an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd
his End, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
him and the Bark fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous.
Being once requir'd
by ſome Phyſicians to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſine
what an Ague was, he
anſwer'd, <hi>That an Ague was
a Diſeaſe that he could cure,
and they could not.</hi> 'Tis to
be noted, that the Bark,
when it is old, is as effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
to cure Agues, as
when it is freſh; and, in
one reſpect, much better;
for the Purgative Quality,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:59977:150"/>
which is obſerv'd to be in
the freſh Bark, goes off in
time. <hi>Spon.</hi> in his Book
of Obſervations, <hi>Sur les
Fievres, &amp; les Febrifuges,</hi>
ſays, <hi>That by diligent Search
he had found, that the</hi> Peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian
<hi>Bark did not come from
the Trunk or Branches, but
from the Root; for he had
tried ſome of the Bark of the
Trunk and Branches, that
was ſent to him, and it was
not at all bitter.</hi> Which
Obſervation may be of
ſome uſe to thoſe in our
World, who endeavour to
find a <hi>Succedaneum</hi> for it.
<hi>I,</hi> ſays he, <hi>have made ſome
Trials in this Matter: The
Bark of the Root of the
Peach-tree is very rough, and
a little bitter; upon which
Account it is, undoubtedly,
very proper for a Looſneſs,
The Bark of the Roots of the
Aſh is alſo rough, and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
acrid, by reaſon of
abundance of Salt contain'd
in it, which gives it its Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brifuge
Virtue. Laſtly, The
Bark of the Roots of the
Black-Cherry-tree is rough,
and bitter; and therefore
the Powder of it given in a
Quartan-Ague, leſſens the
Fits, but does not quite take
them off: Yet,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I do
not queſtion but that it will
cure Fevers, being given or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly,
and in a due quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity.</hi>

Years old, that young ones

have the Grain of Kermes
ſticking to them, on the

a piece of ſtrong Cloth, and
an Earthen Pan over that;
put your Cloth over a Ket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
half fill'd with Water,
and ſet the Kettle upon the
Fire, that the Vapour of
the Water may gently
warm the Nutmegs; when
you find, upon touching
the Pan, it is ſo hot that
you cannot endure your
Hand upon it, you muſt
take off the Boulter; and
putting the Matter into a
Linen Cloth, take its four
Corners, and tie them
quickly together, put them
into a Preſs, between a
couple of warm Plates, ſet
the Pan underneath, and
there will come forth an
Oyl, which congeals as it

Tho' Olives, when

and taſte acrid, bitter and
nauſeous; yet the Oyl that

commonly Pellucid, and a
little yellowiſh. It taſtes

that which is freeſt from
Colour and Taſte, is rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon'd

of Olives cool, dry, and
are aſtringent. They are
chiefly uſed outwardly, for
Fluxes of the Belly of the
Courſes, for an Herpes,
and the like; and with
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:59977:160"/>
Medicines for the Eyes. So
great is the uſe of the Oyl,
both for Meat and Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine,
that it would take up
too much time to mention
all. <hi>Galen, Dioſcorides, Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi>

treated largely of it. One
was ask'd when he was

kept up the Vigour of his
Mind and Body: He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd,
By taking Wine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly,
and by uſing of
Oyl outwardly. <hi>Cardan</hi>
mentions three Things
which prolong Life; Milk,
Hony and Oyl: But he
does not mean that the Oyl
ſhould be uſed outwardly,
but be taken inwardly with
Meat. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaid, that
Oyl and Salt ſhould be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
had in Readineſs, for
that they much conduced
to a long Life. The beſt
Oyl for the Recovery of
Health is that which is
made of Olives before they
are ripe, and then 'tis call'd
Omphacinum: Of this
they make Ointments, and
many other Compoſitions.
Oyl of Ripe Olives is hot,
and moiſtens moderately:
The Old is hotter than the
New. It mollifies, digeſts,
is vulnerary, and looſens
the Belly, an Ounce of it
being taken in hot Beer.
It takes off the Dryneſs of
the Breaſt, cures the Gripes,
opens the Urinary Paſſages,
cleanſes and heals them
when they are ſore. 'Tis
outwardly uſed for Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
and hot Tumours,

pleaſantly. It creates an
Appetite, and extinguiſhes
Thirſt; and therefore is of
good uſe in Fevers. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranges

the Scurvy. The Oyl
preſs'd out of the Bark is
of a fiery quality, as will
appear to any one that ſhall
preſs the freſh Juice near a
Candle; for the Drops,
like Dew, that fly out will
flame and crackle, juſt as
if the Powder of Sulphure
were flung upon the Flame.
Some think that the Bark

clears the Sight. Neck-la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

of ſmall Oranges that fall
off; and they ſmell very
pleaſantly. The Seeds kill
the Worms in Children.
The Seeds being ſet in the
Earth, little Trees ſpring
for a Year, which are eaten
in the manner of Sallets;
they taſte very pleaſantly,
and ſtrengthen the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
and create an Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite.
For the Worms, Take
an Orange, bore an Hole
in it, and preſs out the
Juice; then fill it with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
parts of Oyl of Flax,
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:59977:162"/>
the Juice of Wormwood,

Treacle, and Flower of
Lupins, and let them boyl
a while: Anoint the Pulſe,
the Temples, the Noſtrils,
and the Navel with this
Linament, and you will
find wonderful Succeſs.

made in the following man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:
Take what quantity

Peel of Oranges, beat them
well in a Stone-Mortar,
and add thrice the weight

afterwards it turns to Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar:
They boyl it up in
great Furnaces; but it is
worth noting, that if any
Oyl be mix'd with it, it
will never come to Sugar.
Sugar is much uſed, both
in Food and Phyſick. It
has been ſuppos'd, that the
immoderate uſe of Sugar
here in <hi>England</hi> has been
the Reaſon of the Increaſe
of the Scurvy and of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions
amongſt us: 'Tis
certain that it increaſes the
Scurvy, for by the frequent
uſe of it the Teeth grow
black and rotten, which
are certain Signs of the
Scurvy. Moreover, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
in it a very Corroſive
Salt, which appears by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillation:
And it is well
known, that the Scurvy is
occaſion'd by a Fixed Salt,
and cured by a Volatile
Salt. But it is to be noted,
that Sugar is better to be
mix'd with Medicines pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
to Women's Diſeaſes
than Hony, for Hony is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious
to the Womb. Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
is diſſolv'd in Water,
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:59977:173"/>
then filtrated, and ſo it is
purified; afterwards the
Liquor is evaporated, and
it is made up into Loaves,
or put up in Casks: 'Tis
either Red, brown, or
white, according to the
Degrees of Purification.
When the Sugar has been
refin'd no more than above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid,
it is a little fat: Now
to refine it farther, it is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
in Lime-water, and
boyl'd, and the Scum is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
off; when it is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
boyl'd they caſt it
into Molds of a Pyramidal
Form, which have Holes
at the bottom to let the
more glutinous part run
through, and ſeparate. 'Tis
farther refin'd by boyling it
with the Whites of Eggs in
Water; for the glutinous
quality of the Whites of
Eggs does help to receive
and take away the Impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
that remain in the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
and the boyling drives
them all to the Sides of the
Veſſel, in a Scum: The Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
is paſs'd through a
Cloth, and then evapora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to a due Conſiſtence.
Sugar-Candy is only Sugar
Cryſtalliz'd: The Way to
make it is, to boyl Refin'd
Sugar in Water, to the
Conſiſtence of a thick Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup;
'tis then pour'd into
Pots, wherein little Sticks
have been laid in order,
'tis left in a ſtill place ſome
Days, without ſtirring, and
you have the Sugar-Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
ſticking to the Sticks.
Brown Sugar-Candy is
made after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
Its Sweetneſs proceeds
from an Eſſential Acid Salt,
mix'd with ſome Oyly
Parts, whereof it conſiſts;
for, if you ſeparate theſe
two Subſtances, one from
another, neither of the two
will prove at all ſweet:
The Oyl alone is inſipid
upon the Tongue, becauſe
it makes little or no Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
upon the Nerve
that ſerves for Taſting;
but when the Acid is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
mix'd with it, the
Edges of this Acid do ſerve
for a Vehicle to the Oyl, to
make it penetrate and tic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle
ſuperficially the Nerve,
whereby the Senſe of Taſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is produced: The Acid
therefore being alone, does
become inciſive, and pricks
the Tongue by its Edges;
but when they are dull'd
and blunted by the Ramous
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:59977:174"/>
Parts of the Oyl, then they
have another ſort of Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
and can no longer
pierce the Nerve of Taſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but with a great deal
of Tenderneſs and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
Cask-Sugar is ſweeter
than finer Sugar, becauſe
it contains more viſcous or
fat Parts, which remain the
longer upon the Nerve of
the Tongue: And this
makes us ſometimes prefer
the firſt, as to Uſe, before
the other. Sugar-Candy is
better for Coughs than
common Sugar, becauſe,
being harder, it requires a
longer time to melt in the
Mouth; and beſides, it
keeps the Breaſt moiſter
than the common Sugar.
Spirit of Sugar is made
in the following manner:
Powder and mix eight
Ounces of White Sugar-Candy
with four Ounces
of Sal-Armoniack, put this
Mixture into a Glaſs, or
Earthen Body, whoſe third
part only is thereby fill'd;
fit an Head to the Body,
and place it in a Sand-Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace;
joyn a Receiver to
it, and lute well the Jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
with a wet Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
give it a ſmall Fire
for an Hour only, to heat
the Veſſel, then increaſe it
to the ſecond Degree; there
will diſtil a Liquor, Drop
by Drop, and towards the
End there will riſe white
Vapours into the Head;
increaſe your Fire ſtill
more, until nothing more
comes forth; let the Veſſels
cool, and unlute them, you
will find in the Receiver ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Ounces of a brown Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
that ſmells ill, and
alſo a little black Oyl that
ſticks to the Sides; pour it
all together into a Glaſs-Body,
and having fitted to
it an Head and Receiver,
and luted the Joints, diſtil
in Sand ſix Ounces of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Acid Spirit, that is clear,
and agreeable to the Taſte,
and without any Smell.
'Tis good againſt Gravel,
and the Dropſie, and for a
Looſneſs, and the Bloody-Flux.
The Doſe is, eight
or ten Drops in Tincture
of Roſes, or the like. That
which remains in the Body,
after Rectification, is a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tid
Oyl, which may be
outwardly uſed to cleanſe
old Ulcers. Melaſſoes, or
the Hony of Sugar, are uſed
to make Aqua-vitae; and
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:59977:174"/>
they yield a ſtrong Spirit.
It has been reported, that
ſome Brewers make Ale, in
a great meaſure, with Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſſoes;
but if they do, it
is an abominable Cheat;
for they are not near ſo
wholeſom as Malt. Take
of Brown or Red Sugar
four Spoonfuls, of common
Salt as much as will lie on
a Three-pence, of Cow's-Milk
one Pint; let the
Milk juſt boyl up, diſſolve
the Sugar and the Salt in
it; ſtrain it. This is a
Clyſter, and, generally
ſpeaking, ſerves as well as
the beſt, to empty the
Bowels.</p>

Now-a-days Rough

<hi>Omphaciun</hi> is the
unripe Juice of the Grape
ſtrain'd, and kept in a
Veſſel cloſe ſtop'd: It cools
and dries. It is not only
uſed in Phyſick, but alſo
with Food, in Sauces. It
takes off Nauſeouſneſs, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites
Appetite, ſtops the
Flux of the Belly, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigates
the Heat of the
Stomach and Bowels, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
taken inwardly. And
outwardly applied, it clears
the Sight, as alſo does
Wild Apples, and cleanſes
them from Filth. 'Tis
better for all hot Diſeaſes
than Vinegar. <hi>Sapa</hi> is
New Wine, boyl'd to the
Conſumption of a third
part. <hi>Defrutum</hi> is New
Wine, boyl'd to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
of half. Diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of Wine into Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
is made in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
manner: Fill with
Wine half a large Copper
Body, cover it with its
<hi>Moor</hi>'s-head border'd with
its Refrigeratory, and fit
to it a Receiver; lute well
the Junctures with a wet
Bladder, and diſtil with a
gentle Fire about a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the Liquor, or elſe
until the Liquor which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtils
does not burn when
the Fire is put to it; that
which is in the Receiver
is called Brandy. Brandy
may be drawn from all
ſorts of Wines; but more
of it may be drawn in
ſome Countries, than in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
For Example, The
Wines that are made about
<hi>Orleans</hi> and <hi>Paris</hi> do yield
more Brandy than many
others which ſeem to be
ſtronger; and the Reaſon is,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:59977:177"/>
becauſe thoſe Wines that
appear ſtronger are load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with a great deal of
Tartar, which fixes their
Spirits; whereas the other,
containing but a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
Portion of this Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,
do leave their Spirits
at greater liberty. When
Wine has been drunk,
there is made a Separation
of Spirits in the Body,
much reſembling that
which is made by Diſtilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
for the Heat of the
Bowels warming it, cauſes
the Spirituous Parts to
ſpread on all Sides, through
the Pores, and ſome part
of them to mix with the
Blood, and rarefie it;
from whence it comes to
rejoyce the Heart, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
the Vigour of the
whole Body; but becauſe
theſe Spirits do always tend
upwards, the greateſt part
flies into the Brain, where
it quickens its Motion, and
produces a certain Gaiety
of Mind: But now, tho'
Wine, moderately taken,
is ſo profitable for the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of the Body, yet
it cauſes many Miſchiefs
when it is uſed to Exceſs;
for the Spirits riſing in
great Abundance, do cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate
in the Brain with
ſo much Celerity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they
ſoon confound the whole
Oeconomy: And, indeed,
every one knows, that a
Continuations of Debauches
does at laſt render a Man
dull and ſtupid; that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poplexies,
Palſies, Gout,
Dropſie, and a long Train
of many other Diſeaſes,
are the uſual Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Intemperance. Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Wine is made in the
following manner: Fill a
large Bolt-head, with a
long Neck, half full with
Brandy, and fitting an
Head and Receiver, lute
cloſe the Junctures; ſet
your Bold-head upon a Pot,
fill'd half with Water, to
diſtil in a Vaporous Bath,
the Spirit, which ſeparates
from the Flegm, and riſes
pure; continue this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
af Fire, until nothing
more diſtils: Thus you
will have a Deflegmated
Spirit of Wine at the firſt
Diſtillation. It ſerves for
a Menſtruum to a great
many Things in Chymiſtry.
Half a Spoonful of it is
given to Apoplectical and
Lethargical Perſons, to

are rub'd with it. 'Tis a
good Remedy for Burns,
if applied ſo ſoon as they
happen. And it is good
for Cold Pains, for the
Palſie, Contuſions, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Maladies, wherein it
is requiſite to diſcuſs and
open the Pores. Spirit of
Wine Tartariz'd in made
in the following manner:
Put a Pound of Salt of
Tartar into a long Glaſs-Body,
pour upon it four
Pints of Spirit of Wine
prepar'd as above; place
your Veſſel in Sand, and
cover it with an Head, to
which fit a Receiver; lute
well the Junctures with a
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>et Bladder, and give it a
gradual Fire, which conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
until three parts of the
Spirit of Wine are riſen;
then remove the Fire, and
keep this Spirit in a Viol
well ſtop'd: It has the
ſame Virtues as the other,
but is more ſubtile. The
Liquor that remains in the
Body may be evaporated,
and a Salt of Tartar got,
as good as before. The
Queen of <hi>Hungary</hi>'s Water
is made in the following
manner: Fill a Glaſs or
Earthen Cucurbite half full
with Roſemary-flowers,
gather'd when they are at
beſt, pour upon them a
ſufficient quantity of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Wine to infuſe them;
ſet the Cucurbite in a Bath,
and joyning its Head and
Receiver, lute cloſe the
Junctures, and give it a
digeſting Fire for three
Days; after which, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
them, and pour into
the Cucurbite that which
may have been diſtill'd;
re-fit your Limbeck, and
increaſe the Fire ſo as to
make the Liquor to diſtil
Drop by Drop; when you
have drawn about two
Thirds of it, put out the
Fire, let the Veſſels cool,
and unlute them, and put
the Water ſo diſtill'd into
a Vial well ſtop'd. 'Tis
good in a Palſie, Lethargy,
Apoplexy, and for Hyſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical
Diſeaſes. The Doſe
is, from one Dram to two.
'Tis likewiſe uſed out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly,
for Burns, Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
Cold Pains, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuſions,
Palſie, and in all
other Caſes wherein it is
requiſite to revive the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:59977:178"/>
Ladies uſe to mix
half an Ounce of it with
ſix Ounces of Lilly-water,
or Bean-flower-water, and
waſh their Faces with it.
Wine, like all other Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors
that uſe to ferment,
grows ſowr by the Diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of its Tartar in a
ſecond Fermentation. This
Diſſolution is commonly
made when, upon the
Wine's going to decay,
ſome of the more ſubtile
Spirits are loſt; for the
Tartar taking their Place,
fixes the reſt of the Spirits
which remain in the Wine,
ſo that they can act no
longe. Vinegar is made
by ſetting Wine in ſome
hot place, or by keeping it
too long, or by expoſing it
to the Sun. Vinegar is
frequently uſed in Phyſick,
and Food. Pickle and
Sauces are made of it. It
excites Appetite, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motes
Concoction. 'Tis
uſed in Phyſick to allay
Feveriſh Heats, and to
prevent Putrifaction; to
cut Flegm, and Glutinous
Humours, that they may
be render'd thereby fitter
to be expectorated. Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
uſed, it cures the
Itch, an Herpes, and the
like; but it is injurious to
the Nerves, and Nervous
Parts: It alſo makes the
Body lean. There is a
memorable Story of a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
in the <hi>Belgick</hi> Wars,
who, about the Middle of
his Age, grew ſo very fat,
that he was forc'd to have
Bandage for his Belly;
and finding himſelf grow
more and more unwieldy
every Day, and unfit for
his Buſineſs, he left off
drinking Wine, and drank
Vinegar the reſt of his
Days; by which Means
his Belly aſſwaged, and he
was leſſen'd in weight
Eighty ſeven Pounds. <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtopher
A Vega</hi> ſays, he ſaw
three People that were
hang'd, or ſuffocated ſo
much, that Froth came out
of their Mouths, reſtor'd
to Life by Vinegar, and
the Powder of Pepper, and
Penny-royal. For Cruſty,
Stinking Ulcers of the
Head, which Children are
commonly troubled withal,
and ſometimes grown Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
Take of Ginger three
Ounces, boyl it in ſharp
Vinegar and Butter, of
each half a Pound, till the
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:59977:179"/>
Vinegar is conſum'd; then
beat it into an Ointment,
with Butter, and anoint
the Sores with it Morning
and Evening, and it will
cure them in four or five
Days. In the <hi>London-Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſatory</hi>
are the following
Sorts of Vinegar: Roſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary-Vinegar,
Clove-Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar,
Roſe-Vinegar, El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-flower-Vinegar,
Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
of Squils, and Treacle-Vinegar.
The Vapour of
Vinegar is very proper in
the Plague. Vinegar is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtill'd
in the following
manner: Put ſix Quarts
of ſtrong Vinegar into an
Earthen Pan, evaporate in
a Bath about a Quart,
and pour that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
into a Glaſs or
Earthen Cucurbite, and
diſtil it in a ſtrong Sand-heat,
until there remain at
bottom nothing but a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
like Hony; keep
this Vinegar well ſtop'd:
Many call it Spirit of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar.
Its principal Uſe
is, to diſſolve or precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
Bodies. 'Tis ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
mix'd in Cordial-Potions,
to reſiſt Putrifa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
The Doſe is half a
Spoonful; 'tis mix'd with
Water. And this Oxyo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
is uſed to ſtop Hemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhagies,
taken inwardly;
and to aſſwage Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
applied outwardly.
Tartar is that which is
found ſticking to Casks of
Wine, like a very hard
Stone, ſometimes white,
ſometimes red, according
to the Colour of the Wine
it comes from. White
Tartar is to be preferr'd
before Red, becauſe it is
purer, and contains leſs
Earth. Both one and the
other are had in great
Abundance in <hi>Languedoc</hi>
and <hi>Provence;</hi> but the beſt
White Tartar of all is
brought out of <hi>Germany.</hi>
Cryſtals of Tartar are made
in the following manner:
Boyl in a great deal of
Water what quantity of
White Tartar you pleaſe,
until it be all diſſolv'd;
paſs the Liquor hot through
<hi>Hippocrates</hi>'s Sleeve, into
an Earthen Veſſel, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaporate
about half of it;
ſet the Veſſel in a cool
place two or three Days,
and you will find little
Cryſtals on the Sides,
which you are to ſeparate;
evaporate again half the
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:59977:179"/>
Liquor that remains, and
remit the Veſſel to the
Cellar, as before; there
will ſhoot out new Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtals:
Continue doing thus,
until you have got all the
Tartar: Dry the Cryſtals
in the Sun, and keep them
for uſe. The Cryſtal of
Tartar is Purgative, and
Aperitive: 'Tis good for
Hydropical and Aſthmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Perſons, and for Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
and Quartan-Agues.
The Doſe is, from half a
Dram to three Drams, in
Broth, or ſome other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Liquor. Salt of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar
is made in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
manner: Take four
Pounds of good White-wine-Tartar,
beat it fine,
make it up in Half-pounds,
in ſeveral Sheets of Brown
Paper, dip them in Water,
place them in the midſt
of a Charcoal-Fire, cover
them over therewith, let
the Fire burn out, you
will find at the Bottom
Tartar calcin'd in black
Lumps; take the Tartar
thus calcin'd, beat it groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
put it into a Pipkin, or
Iron Pot, full of Water,
ſet it over the Fire, and
let the Water boyl till half
is conſum'd; then take it
off, and let it ſettle; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
it as clear as you can,
pour on a little more Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
upon the Faeces, and
let it boyl, then decant it
as before; taſte the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
whether it be ſalt,
and proceed as before: Do
ſo as long as you find the
Water taſtes ſalt; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
filter all the Liquor
pour'd off, through Paper,
and boyl it up to a Salt.
Tartar Vitriolated is made
in the following manner:
Put into a Glaſs-Body what
quantity you pleaſe of Oyl
of Tartar made <hi>per Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quium,</hi>
which is nothing
but the expoſing Salt of
Tartar for ſome Days in a
Cellar, in a wide Glaſs-Veſſel,
till it turns to a
Liquor: Pour upon this
Diſſolution of Tartar, by
little and little, Rectified
Spirit of Vitriol; there
will be a great Efferveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency:
Continue to drop
more in, till there is no
farther Ebullition; then
place your Cucurbite in
Sand, and evaporate the
Spirit with a little Fire,
there will remain a very
white Salt, keep it in a
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:59977:180"/>
Vial well ſtop'd. 'Tis a
good Aperitive; and is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
a little purgative. 'Tis
given in Hypochondriacal
Caſes, in Quartan-Agues,
King's-Evil, and in all
other Diſeaſes, wherein it
is neceſſary to open Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions,
and to force U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine.
The Doſe is, from
ten to thirty Grains, in
ſome proper Liquor.</p>
