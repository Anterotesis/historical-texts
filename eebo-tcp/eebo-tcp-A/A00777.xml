            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T will seeme strange to those, that better know my <hi>vnworthinesse</hi> then your <hi>merits,</hi> that I should admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Physicke</hi> to a <hi>Physician.</hi> But my <hi>Apologie</hi> is iust; conuincing rather them of <hi>ignorance,</hi> then my selfe of <hi>presumption.</hi> It is not a <hi>Potion,</hi> I send, but a <hi>Prescript</hi> in paper; which the foolish Patient did eate vp, when he read in it written, <hi>Take this.</hi> Neither do I send it, to direct you, but that you should rectifie it. So the poore <hi>Painter</hi> sent <hi>Appelles</hi> a <hi>Picture,</hi> to mend it, not to commend it. That which tastes of <hi>Philosophie</hi> in it, is but so much of those <hi>axiomes</hi> and <hi>rudiments,</hi> as I gather'd in the <hi>Vniuersitie</hi> in a short time, and haue had much opportunity to lose since. Somewhat is chym'd out of <hi>experience;</hi> wherein I may say, <hi>Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit as</hi> was <hi>ingenii largitor:</hi> as <hi>Plinie</hi> writes of the Rauen; who labouring of thirst, and spying a vessell with
<pb facs="tcp:488:3"/>
some little water in it, but so deepe as she could not reach, filled the vessell with stones; till the heauier matter sinking downewards, raysed vp the lighter to her easie apprehension. My owne ill health forced me to looke into that poore <hi>Cisterne</hi> of <hi>knowledge,</hi> which I had: and finding it almost <hi>drie,</hi> I assayed by some new <hi>contemplations,</hi> to raise it vp to experience; which now, behold, runnes ouer, and (without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution to it selfe) is communicatiuely dispersed to others. Only doe you vse it, as I desire you should my selfe: if it be in health, conserue it: if foule purge it. For my owne part, I am content, that no happie <hi>meditation</hi> of mine should be <hi>vt Curia Martis Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis;</hi> or like some precious <hi>mysterie,</hi> which a Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitioner will get money by, whiles hee liues; but suffer none els to vse, when hee is dead: for hee resolues, it shall die with him. It is more <hi>Morall,</hi> then <hi>Physicall;</hi> and yet the greater part <hi>Theologicall.</hi> wherein I haue most satisfied my owne conscience, in ayming at that punctuall <hi>Center,</hi> and blessed <hi>Scope,</hi> whither all endeuours should looke; the straitening our warped <hi>Affections,</hi> and directing the <hi>Soule</hi> to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. And in this passage, (you must pardon mee) I feare not to say your <hi>memory</hi> at least, if not your <hi>vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,</hi> may hereby be helped. My <hi>Medicines</hi> are not very <hi>bitter;</hi> but nothing at all <hi>sweete</hi> to a <hi>sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall</hi> palate: learning from <hi>Saluian;</hi> that <hi>Quae petu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantium auribus placent, aegrotantium animis non pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunt.</hi> For my <hi>soule,</hi> I prescribe to others that, which I desire euer to take my selfe; such sauing <hi>Recipe's,</hi> as Gods holy <hi>Writ</hi> hath directed mee. For my <hi>Body,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:488:3"/>
though I would not haue it lamed by my owne neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, that it might leane vpon the staffe of <hi>Physicke;</hi> hauing not so much <hi>health</hi> to spare, as might allow some vnthrifty expence of it on surfets: yet when it is <hi>sicke,</hi> I desire no other <hi>Phisician</hi> then your selfe. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps a great number of men are of my mind, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent are the knocks at your <hi>Study-</hi>dore: but I am sure that all those desires are not enflamed with that light of knowledge, which I haue of your sufficiency, through much priuate conference. Rudenesse or prolixitie do ill in an <hi>Epistle,</hi> and worse when both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; and may perhaps please a mans selfe, and none els. I haue done, when I haue (yet once againe) chaleng'd your promised <hi>Iudiciall</hi> of <hi>vrines:</hi> which if you make publike, you shall haue the like addition to my singular thankes. Till a good gale of oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity waft my self ouer to your <hi>Sudbury,</hi> I haue sent you this <hi>Messenger</hi> of that loue and seruice, shall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be ready to attend you; desiring that, as it hath found the way to you, you would giue it your <hi>Passe</hi> to the World; and (if it grow poore with contempt) your <hi>Legacie</hi> of <hi>approbation.</hi> Wingraue <hi>in Buck.

He is vnwise in being so bitter against Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies: for therein hee is palpably against himselfe, himselfe being nothing else but Ceremonie.

                  <head>Signes and Symptomes.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Physicions</hi> say of the <hi>Migram-</hi>affected, that in the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent fit of the passion, they can abide: 1. No noyse or lowd speech: 2. Not cleare light: 3. Not to drinke Wine: 4. Nor almost to moue at all, &amp;c. Our <hi>Braine-sicke</hi> Nouelist is described by such tokens.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Lowd speech hee loues not, except from his owne lippes. All noise is tedious to him, but his owne: and that is most tedious to the companie. Hee loues to heare himselfe talke out of measure. He wonders, that the senses of all his hearers doe not get vp into their eares, to watch and catch his mysteries with attention and silence; when as yet himself is more <hi>Non-resident</hi> from his theme, then a discontinuer is from his charge.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The cleere light he cannot endure, for his braine is too light already. He presumes, that his head containes more knowledge then tenne Bishops; and wonders that the Church was so ouerseene, as to forget him, when of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices were disposing, or places a dealing; and because he can get none, railes at all for Antichristian. He is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wise man, if he might teach all men to iudge him, as he iudgeth himselfe: and no starre should shine in our Orbe, without borrowing some of his light. Hee offers to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:488:8"/>
that man, that would informe him; and presumes of so much light, that if himselfe were set, our world would be left without a Sunne.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Wine he hates, specially when it is powred into his wounds: (as the <hi>Fathers</hi> interpret the <hi>Samaritans wine</hi> to the <hi>wounded man,</hi> to clense and purge him.) Reproofe and hee are vtter enemies; no man is good enough to chide him: wholsome counsell, which is indeed Wine to a weake soule, he accounts Vineger; nothing so pleaseth him as his owne Lees. <hi>Opinion</hi> hath brewed him ill, and he is like water scared out of the wits.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He must not bee moued, nor remoued from what hee holdes: his will is like the Persian law, vnalterable. You may moue him to choler, not to knowledge: his braine is turned, like a Bell rung too deepe, and cannot be fetcht backe againe. His owne affectation is his pully, that can moue him; no engine else stirres him. A man may like him at first, as one that neuer heard musick doth the Tinkers note on his kettle; but after a while, they are both alike tedious. There is no helpe for his auditour, by by any excuses to shift him off; if he haue not the patience to endure an impertinent discourse, hee must venter the censure of his manners, and run away. His discourse is so full of parentheses, as if he were troubled with the rhume, and could not spette. He is euer tying hard knots, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tying them, as if no body had hired him, and therefore he must finde himselfe worke. If hee light on the sacred Writ, he conceitedly allegorizes on the plainest subiect, and makes the Scripture no more like it selfe, then <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chols</hi> Image in the bed vpon a pillow of Goates haire, was like <hi>Dauid.</hi> He carries bread at his backe and feedes vpon stones. Like a full fedde Dogge, he leaues the soft meate to lye gnawing vpon bones: that wee may say of him, this man hath a strong wit, as wee say, that dogge hath good teeth.</p>

                  <p>THe way to cure the <hi>Migram</hi> is diuers, according to the cause; either by cutting a veine, purging, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulsiue or locall remedies. But the sanation of this <hi>Brain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke</hi> malady is very difficult: insomuch, that <hi>Salomon</hi> sayth, <hi>There is more hope of a foole,</hi> then of one <hi>wise in his owne conceit.</hi> For he imagines the whole world to be sick, and himselfe only sound. I might prescribe him the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a veine which feedes this disease, that is, affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: the itching bloud of singularity let out, would much ease him. Or a good purge of humility to take him down a little, because he stands so high in his owne ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination: and full vessels, to preuent their bursting must haue timely vent. Or a little <hi>opium</hi> of sequestring him from businesse, and confining him that hee might take some sleepe; for his braines want rest. Or a little <hi>Euphor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bium</hi> of sound admonition and fit reproofe dropped into his eare warme. Some <hi>Euphrasia</hi> or Eye-bright would do well.

The paralel to it in the <hi>Soule,</hi> is <hi>Inconstancie,</hi> a motion without rule, a various aspect, a diuersifying intention. The <hi>Inconstant</hi> man is like a <hi>Pour contrell;</hi> if hee should change his apparell so fast as his thought, how often in a day would he shift himselfe? He would be a <hi>Proteus</hi> too, and vary kinds. The reflection of euery news melts him, whereof he is as soone glutted. As he is a Noune, hee is only adiectiue, depending on euery nouel perswasion: as a Verbe, he knowes only the Present Tense. To day hee goes to the Key to bee shipped for <hi>Rome,</hi> but before the Tyde come, his tyde is turn'd. One party thinke him theirs, the aduerse theirs: he is with both, with neither, not an howre with himselfe. Because the Birds &amp; Beasts be at controuersie, he will be a Batte, and get him both wings and teeth. He would come to heauen, but for his halting: two opinions (like two Water-men) almost pul him a-pieces, when he resolues to put his iudgement into a Boat, and goe somewhither; presently he steps backe, and goes with neither. It is a wonder, if his affections, being but a little luke-warme water, do not make his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion stomack-sicke. Indifferencie is his ballast, and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion his sayle: he resolues, not to resolue. He knowes not what he should hold; hee knowes not what hee doth hold. He opens his mind to receiue motions, as one opens his palme to take a handful of water; he hath very much, if he could hold it. He is sure to dye, but not what religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to dye in; he demurres like a posed Lawyer, as if delay could remoue some impediments. He is drunk when he riseth, and reeles in a morning fasting. He knowes not whether he should say his <hi>Pater noster</hi> in Latine, or Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish; and so leaues it and his prayers vnsayd. Hee makes himselfe ready for an appointed feast; by the way hee
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:488:9"/>
heares of a <hi>Sermon,</hi> he turnes thitherward, yet betwixt the Church gate, and Church dore, hee thinkes of businesse and retires home againe. In a controuerted point hee holdes with the last reasoner hee either heard or read, the next diuerts him; and his opinion dwels with him, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps so long as the teacher of it is in his sight. He will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther take drosse for gold, then trie it in the fornace. Hee receiues many iudgements, retaines none, embracing so many faiths, that he is little better then an Infidell.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>Causes.</head>
                  <p>THey giue a double cause of this disease in the bodie; either the distemperature and euil affectednesse of the braine; or an offence giuen to it from the mouth of the stomack: vapours, grosse and tough humours, or windy exhalations, either lodging in the braine, or sent thither from the stomack, turning about the animall spirits: hence the braine staggers with giddinesse. This spirituall <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constancie</hi> ariseth from like causes. If it be in religion, it proceeds from cloudy imaginations, fancies, fictions, and forced dreames, which keepe the mind from a sober and peacefull consideratenesse. Multitude of opinions, like foggy vapours, mist the intellectuall faculty, and like re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerberated blastes whirle about the spirits. Hee sees some Ceremoniall deuisions in our Church, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore dares not stedfastly embrace that truth, which both parts without contention teach and obserue. So leaues the blessing of his mother, because hee beholds his brethren quarrelling: whiles he sees the vnreconcileable oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Rome</hi> and vs, which he fondly labours to atone, he forsakes both, and will now be a Church alone. Thus his brest is full of secret combates, contradictions, affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, negatiues, and whiles he refuseth to ioine with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, he is diuided in himselfe: And yet will rather search
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:488:10"/>
excuses for his vnstayednesse, then ground for his rest. He lothes <hi>Manna</hi> after two dayes feeding, and is almost wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Sunne for perpetuall shining. If the Temple pauements be euer worne with his visitant feete, hee will runne farre to a new Teacher: and rather then be bound to his owne parish, he will turne Recusant. He will admire a new Preacher, till a quarter of the sand is out; but if the Church dores bee not locked vp, he cannot stay out the houre: what he promiseth to a Collection to day, he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets, or at least denies the next morning. His best dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling would be his confined chamber, where his irresolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion might trouble nothing, but his pillow. In humane matters, the cause of his variablenesse is not varied, but the object. Hee is transformable to all qualities, a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perd lumpe of waxe to receiue any forme, yet no impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on stickes long vpon him. he holds it the quicknesse of his wit, to be voluble.</p>

He af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects an obiect with dotage, and as superstitiously courts, as an Idolator his guilded block: but it is a wonder, if his passionate loue out-liue the age of a wonder, 9. daies. He

respects in all things noueltie aboue goodnesse; and the childe of his owne braines, within a weeke hee is ready to iudge a Bastard. Hee salutes his wits after some inuented toy, as a Seruing-man kisseth his hand, when instantly on another plots arising, hee kickes the former out of dores. He puls downe this day what hee builded the other, now disliking the site, now the fashion, and sets men on worke to his owne vndoing. Hee is in his owne house, as his thoughts in his owne braine, transient guests: like a Hag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, you know not where to take him. He hunts well for a gird, but is soone at a losse. If hee giues any profession a winters entertainment, yet hee is whether for a penny the next Spring.

               <p>THe next disease I would describe, is <hi>Phrenzy</hi> or <hi>Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi> Now though Physicians do clearly distinguish betwixt these two, <hi>Phrenzy</hi> and <hi>Madnesse;</hi> calling Phrenzy an inflammation of the braine without a Feuer; or an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postumation <note place="margin">Galen.</note> bred and ingendred in the pellicles of the braine, or <hi>pia mater:</hi> and <hi>Mania</hi> or <hi>Madnesse,</hi> an infection of the former cell of the head, without a Feuer: the one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busing the imagination, the other rauishing the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; I list not to dispute or determine. That which serues my intention, is to conferre either of these passions, with a Spirituall disease of like nature, <hi>Anger. Irafuror breuis.</hi> It is a madnesse, I am sure, I am not sure how short. I doe not ask for men passionlesse, this is <hi>hominem de homine tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re.</hi> Giue them leaue to be men, not mad men. <hi>Iraoptimo loco donum Dei: &amp; magna est ars, irasciverbis praemeditatis,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ierem.</note> 
                  <hi>&amp; tempore opportuno.</hi> Anger in the best sense is the gift of God, and it is no small art, to expresse anger with preme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated termes, and on seasonable occasion. God placed <hi>Anger</hi> amongst the affections ingraffed in nature, gaue it a seate, fitted it with instruments, ministred it matter whence it might proceed, prouided humours whereby it is nourished. It is to the <hi>Soule</hi> as a nerue to the body. The Philosopher cals it the <hi>Whetstone to fortitude,</hi> a spurre in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to set forward Vertue. This is simply rather a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion, then a passion.</p>
               <p>But there is a vicious, impetuous, franticke <hi>anger,</hi> ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest for priuate and personall grudges; not like a medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine to cleare the eye, but to put it out. This pernicious disease of the <hi>Soule</hi> hath degrees. 1. It is <hi>inhumane;</hi> Tygers
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:488:11"/>
deuoure not Tygers, this rageth against kind and kindred. 2. <hi>Impious;</hi> it rageth often against God; as that <hi>Pope</hi> vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a field lost against the <hi>Frenchmen: Sic esto nunc Gallicus. So, turne French now, &amp;c. 3. Mad;</hi> for it often rageth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst vnreasonable creatures, as <hi>Balaam</hi> striking his Asse; how much is such a man more irrationall and bestiall, then the Beast he malignes? 4. It is more then <hi>mad,</hi> striking at insensible things: as <hi>Xerxes</hi> wrote a defying letter to <hi>Athos</hi> a <hi>Thracian</hi> mountaine. <hi>Mischieuous</hi> Athos, <hi>lifted vp to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, make thy quarries passable to my trauell, or I will cut thee downe, and cast thee into the sea.</hi> But his reuenge was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnderstood, feared, nor felt. So the <hi>Affricans</hi> being infested with a North winde, that couered their corne fields with sand from a mountaine, leuied an army of men to fight with that wind; but were all buryed vnder the sand. So <hi>Darius,</hi> because a Riuer had drowned him a white Horse, vowed to cut it into so many Channels, that a woman with child might go ouer drie-shoo'd. We haue some so madly impatient with a storme, wind &amp;c. which might answere them, as <hi>Rabshaceh</hi> told the <hi>Iewes: Am I</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Esay 36, 10.</note> 
                  <hi>come hither without the Lord? it is he that sent mee.</hi> This an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is imediatly directed against God: the heart speakes Atheisme, only in other words. 5. It is <hi>vnnaturall,</hi> for it <note place="margin">Insanit: cum aliena nequit, sua pectora rodit.</note> maligneth a mans selfe. It is full of consternation and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement, and neuer vseth violence, without torment to it selfe. It thinks to offer wrong, and indeed suffers it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ipsa sibi est hostis vesania, seque furendo-Interimit.</hi> As the franticke or drunkard doe that, intoxicate, which sober, they would quake to thinke of; so these irefull, direfull men (or rather beastes) dare in their fits play with Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, mingle poysons, act massacres, whereat their awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked soules shudder.</p>
               <p>The higher the person in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this phrenzy raigns, the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Basil.</hi> In potestate nihil nisi pote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statem respi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere.</note> greater the fault. The Master-Bee hath no sting, the rest haue: the greater power, the lesse passion. It is a State<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrannie, in authority to minde nothing but authoritie.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:488:12"/>
                  <hi>Posse &amp; nolle, nobile.</hi> It is noble to may and wil not. When a rayling wretch followed a Heathen Prince with oblo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies all day, and home to his dores at night, he requited him with commaunding his seruant to light him home to his house with a torch. <hi>Damascen</hi> makes three degrees of <hi>anger; Bilem, Iracundiam, Infensionem:</hi> Choler, Wrath, heauy Displeasure. Some haue added a fourth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The first hath a beginning and motion, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently ceaseth; wee call this <hi>Choler.</hi> Like fire in stubble, soone kindled, and soone out. These are like gun-pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to which you no sooner giue fire, but they are in your face. They say, these hot men are the best natur'd; but I say then, the best are naught. These are stung with a net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and allayd with a docke.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The second is not so soone conceiued, but takes deeper holde in the memorie. This fire is neither easily kindled, nor easily put out: like fire in Iron, which hardly taking, long abideth. These men are like greene logges, which once set on combustion, continue burning day and night too.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The third entertaine this fire sodainly, and retaine it perpetually, not desisting without reuenge. These are like fire, which bewrayeth not it selfe without the ruine and waste of that matter wherin it hath caught: this worst.</p>
               <p n="4">4 The fourth is a moderate <hi>Anger,</hi> not soone incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, but quickly appeased: and this is the best, because li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest to the disposition of God, <hi>who is mercifull and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 103. 8.</note>

                  <head>Causes.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>PHrensie</hi> is caused by abundant bloud, or choler occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pying the braines or the filmes therof: the more adust this choler is, the more pernicious the madnes. The cause of <hi>anger,</hi> is the giuing to Passion the dominion ouer Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:488:12"/>
                     <hi>Seneca</hi> sayes, <hi>Causa iracundiae opinio iniuriae est:</hi> the cause of anger is the conceit of iniurie. Such a man gets vp on <note place="margin">De ira lib. 1. cap. 22.</note> the wilde Iade his choler, and spurres him on, hauing no bridle of moderation to hold him backe. His conuersati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is so full of cholericke fits, as a booke of tedious paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theses, that they marre the sense of his life. He is like an egge in rosting, hopefull to be good meate, but it growes too hot on a sodaine, and flyes in your face not without a great noyse. <hi>Anger</hi> is able to turne <hi>Dametas</hi> into <hi>Hercules furens,</hi> teaching him that is strong to fight, him that is not <note place="margin">Ira forti pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducit lacertes, imbelli lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guam.</note> to talke: whilest the lightning of his rage lasts, hee thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders out a challenge, but after a little calme meditation, sounds a retreat. He menaceth the throtes of his enemies, though they be many, and sweares loud hee will be their Priest, hee meanes Executioner. But if you compare his threatnings and his after-actions, you would say of them, as that wise man sheering his hogges: Here is a great deale of crie, but a little wooll. His enemies are worse feared then hurt, if so they be in personall presence, as he is in sober iudgement a little out of the way.</p>

Hee cannot endure to doe any thing by himselfe, that may be done by Attourney. Hee forestalls perswasion inducing him to any worke, by forecasting the vnprofitablenesse: he holds businesse mans cruellest ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, and a monstrous deuourer of time. His body is so swolne with lazy humours, that he moues like a tunne vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on two pottle pots.

will rather trust, then step out to ouersee. Neither summer nor winter scape the blame of his lazinesse: in the one it is too hot, in the other too colde to worke. Summer hath dayes too long, winter nights too cold; hee must needes helpe the one with a nap at noone, the other with a good fire.

The <hi>cause</hi> of <hi>Idlenesse</hi> is indulgence to the flesh, a forgetfulnesse of the end of our creation, a wilfull digression from man: for the lazy wretch is a dormouse in an humane huske. To man motion is naturall, the ioints and eyes are made to moue; and the mind is neuer asleep, as if it were set to watch the body: Sleepe is the image of death, sayth the Poet: and therefore the Church-sleeper is a dead corps, set in his pew like a coffin, as if the Preacher were to make his funerall Sermon.

                  <p>THe <hi>corporal</hi> disease is easily perceiued, by insatiate fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, which yet ministers almost no vertue to the body, but it is rather made lean, and wasted therwith; the skinne is rarefied, the body made fluid and apt to much e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion, &amp;c.

His eares are set to tell the clocke; his whole carkase a meere Anatomie.

Your <hi>Usurer</hi> makes his money truly do al these <note place="margin">Populus me si bulat at mih plaudo ipse do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi. Hor.</note> at once. He drownes the noyse of the peoples curses, with the musicke of his money; as the <hi>Italians</hi> in a great thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ring their bels, and shoote off their Cannons, by an artificiall noyse of their owne, to dead the naturall of bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken cloudes. His practice mockes Philosophy, <hi>Quòdex nihilo nihil fit,</hi> and teaches of nothing to get something. He is a ranke Whore-master with his mistresse <hi>Pecunia,</hi> and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:488:20"/>

with waxe and paper. He sweares damnably to the truth of that he affirms; as fearing otherwise not to be beleeued, because without that othing it, he will credit none himself. The bastardy of swearing lays on him the true fatherhood. Hee will trust neither man nor God without a pawne: not so much as his Taylor with the stuffe to make his clothes: he must be a Broker, or no neighbour. Hee hath no faith; for he beleeues nothing, but what he knowes; and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge nullifies beleefe. If others laugh, he imagines him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe their ridiculous obiect: if there bee any whispering, <hi>conscius ipse sibi, &amp;c.</hi> it must be of him without question. If he goes to law, he is the aduocates sprite, and haunts him worse then his owne <hi>malus genius.</hi> Hee is his owne Cater, his owne Receiuer, his owne Secretary; and takes such paines, as if necessitie forced him, because all seruants hee thinks theeues. He dares not trust his mony aboue ground for feare of men; nor vnder ground for feare of rust. When he throwes his censures at actions, his lucke is still to goe out: and so whiles he playeth with other mens credits, he cousins himselfe of his owne. His opinion lights vpon the worst sense still; as the Fly, that passeth the sound parts to faste<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on a scab; or a Dorre, that ends his flight in a dunghil. Without a <hi>Subpaena</hi> these timorous cowherds dare not to London, for feare lest the citie aire should conspire to poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son them: where they are euer crying, <hi>Lord, haue mercie on vs,</hi> when as <hi>Lord, haue mercie on vs</hi> is the special thing they feared. The ringing of bels tunes their hearts into melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly; and the very sight of a corps is almost enough to turne them into corpses. On the Thames they dare not come, because they haue heard some there drowned: nor neere the Parliament-house, because it was once in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of blowing vp. Home this Embleme of diffidence comes, and there liues with distrust of others, and dies in distrust of himselfe; onely now finding death a certaine thing to trust to.</p>

                  <p>THe <hi>Signes</hi> of the disease are best discerned by the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents words. The <hi>cause</hi> of <hi>Ambition</hi> is a strong opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of honour; how well he could become a high place, or a high place him. It is a proud couetousnesse, a glorious and Court-madnes. The head of his reason caught a bruise on the right side, his vnderstanding; and euer since he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes affection, as his principall guide. Hee professeth a new quality, called the art of climbing: wherin he teacheth others by patterne, not so much to aspire, as to break their neckes. No staire pleaseth him, if there be a higher; and yet ascended to the top, he complaines of lownesse. He is not so soone layd in his bed of honour, but hee dreames of a higher preferment, and would not sit on a seate, long e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to make it warme. His aduancement giues him a fresh prouocation; and he now treades on that with a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainfull foote, which ere-while hee would haue kissed to obtaine. Hee climbes falling towers, and the hope to scale them, swallowes all feare of toppling downe. Hee is him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe an Intelligencer to greatnes, yet not without vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>officers

of the same ranke. You shall see him narrow-eyed with watching, affable and open-brested like <hi>Absolon,</hi> full of insinuation so long as he is at the staire-foote: but when authoritie hath once spoken kindly to him, with <hi>Friend, sit vp higher,</hi> he lookes rougher then <hi>Hercules;</hi> so bigge, as if the riuer of his bloud would not bee banked within his veines. His tongue is <hi>flabellum Diaboli,</hi> and <hi>flagellum iusti:</hi> bent to scourge some, flatter others, infect, infest all. <hi>Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pina, Neros</hi> mother, being told by an Astrologer, that her sonne should be Emperour, but to her sorrow: answered, <hi>Let my sorrow be what it will, so my sonne may get the Empire.</hi> He hath high desires, low deserts. As <hi>Tully</hi> for his <hi>Pindines<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi> he spends much money about a little preferment; and with greater cost then the captaine bought his Burges<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, hee purchaseth incorporeall fame; which passeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, as swift, as time doth follow motion; &amp; whose weight is nothing but in her name, wheras a lower place well ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged, leaues behinde it a deathlesse memory. Like a great winde, he blowes downe all friends that stand in his way to rising. Policy is his post-horse, and he rides all vpon the spurre, till he come to <hi>None-such.</hi> His greatest plague is a Riuall.

there is a higher reckoning to be made of a higher place.

He is in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany holy and demure, but alone demurres of the matter; so shuts out the diuell at the gate, and lets him in at the posterne.</p>
                  <p>His words are precise, his deeds concise; hee prayes so long in the Church, that he may with lesse suspicion prey on the Church: which he doth the more peremptorily, if his power bee answerable. If his place will afford it, his grace will without question.

formall precisenesse, like a Porter to hold the dore, whiles diuels dance within. He giues God nothing but shew, as if he would pay him his reckoning with chalke; which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth the debt. If euer his almes smell of bounty, hee giues them in publicke.

Hee is false in his friendship, hartlesse in his zeale, proud in his humilitie. He railes against enterludes, yet is himselfe neuer off the stage, and condemnes a maske, when his whole life is nothing els. He sends a begger from his gate, bountifully feasted with Scripture sentences; and (though he likes them not) so much of the Statutes, as will serue to saue his money. But if euery house were of his profession, Charities hand would no longer hold vp pouerties head. What his tongue spoke, his hands recant; and he weepes when he talkes of his youth, not that it was wicked, but that it is not. His tongue is his dissimulations lacquay, and runs continually on that errand: hee is the Strangers Saint, his neighbours Sycophant, his owne Polititian: his whole life being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els, but a continuall scribbling after the set Copy of <hi>Hypocrisie.</hi>

The one, <hi>dat non rogatus:</hi> the other, <hi>non dat roga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus.</hi> One hand is his receiuer, but like <hi>Briareus,</hi> he hath an hundred hands to lay out. He would beare <hi>Dissipatoris, non dispensatoris officium.</hi> His father went to the diuel one way, and he will follow him another: and because hath chosen the smoother way, he makes the more haste. Parasites are his Tenterhookes, and they stretch him till he bursts; and then leaue him hanging in the raine. You may put his heart in your pocke; if you talke to him bare-headed, with many <hi>parentheses of your worship:</hi> there is no vpstart buyes his titles at a dearer rate. He loues a well furnished table; so he may haue three <hi>Ps.</hi> to his guests: <hi>Parasites, Panders,</hi> and <hi>Players:</hi> the fourth he cannot abide, <hi>Preachers.</hi> He wil be applauded for a while, though he want (almost) pitie, when he wants. Like an houreglasse turn'd vp, he neuer leaues running, till all be out. He neuer lookes to the bottome of his patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, til it be quite vnrauelled; and then (too late) complains that the stocke of his wealth ranne course at the fag-end. His father had too good an opinion of the world, &amp; he too much disdaines it.

He vyes vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties with the <hi>Slothfull,</hi> and it is hard to say, who wins the game; yet giue him the bucklers: for Idlneesse is the coach to bring a man to <hi>Needome,</hi> Prodigalitie the post-horse.

vnder the yeares of discretion; and if Prouidence doe not take him Ward, his heires shall neuer be sought after. His vessell hath three leakes, a lasciuious eye, a gaming hand, a deified belly; and to content these, hee can neither rule his heart, nor his purse. When the shot comes to be payd, to draw in his company is a quarrel. When he feeles want, (for till then he neuer sees it) he complaines of Greatnes for ingratitude, that hee was not thought of when promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were a dealing. When his last acre lies in his purse, he proiects strange things, and builds houses in the ayre, hauing sold those on the ground he turnes malecontent, and shifts that hee neuer had, Religion.

Whereas a melting heart bleeds at the least blow, he feeles not the sword drinking vp his bloud.

                  <p>THe <hi>Cure</hi> of the <hi>Apoplexie</hi> is almost desperate.

There are fiue bels, that must ring this peale.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>Conscience</hi> is the <hi>Trebble,</hi> and this troubles him a little: when this bell strikes, hee drownes the noyse of it with good fellowship. But it sounds so shrill, that at last it will be heard; especially if God puls it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Preaching</hi> is the <hi>Stint</hi> or the <hi>Certen</hi> to all the rest. This is <hi>Aarons Bell,</hi> and it must be rung loude to wake him: for lightly he begins his nappe with the <hi>Sermon,</hi> and when the parish is gone home, hee is left in his seate fast asleepe: yet this may at last stirre him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, another <hi>Bell</hi> in this ring, is the death of others round about him; whom he accompanyes to the Church with a deader heart then the corps; knowes he is gone to iudgement, yet prouides not for his owne accounts at that <hi>Audite.</hi> It may bee, this spectacle and a mourning cloake may bring him to weepe.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the oppressed <hi>Poore</hi> is a <hi>Counter-tenor,</hi> and rings loude knels of mones, grones, and supplications, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to him for his pitie, or against him for his iniury. If this bell, so heauily tolling, do not waken him, it will wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken God against him. <hi>Their crie is come vp into the eares of the</hi>

                  </p>

the Oppressor: the corne, wine, oyle, against the Epicure.</p>
                  <p>Happily this peale may wake him. If not, there is yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother goade, affliction on himselfe, God cutting short his hornes, that he may not gore his neighbours: and letting him bloud in his riches, lest being too ranke, hee should grow into a surfet: or casting him downe on his bed of sickenesse, and there taking sleepe from his body, because his soule hath had too much.

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:488:35"/>
the bowels, which offring to descend, is turned backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. You shall easily know a <hi>vaine-glorious</hi> man: his own commendation rumbles within him, till he hath bulked it out; &amp; the aire of it is vnsauory. In the field, he is touching heauen with a launce; in the street, his eye is still cast ouer his shoulder. He stands vp so pertly, that you may know he is not laden with fruite. If you would drinke of his wisedome, knocke by a sober question at the barrell, and you shall finde by the sound, his wits are emptie. In al com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, like chaffe he will be vppermost: hee is some surfet in natures stomake, &amp; cannot be kept down. A goodly Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse tree, fertile only of leaues. He drinks to none beneath the salt; and it is his Grammar rule without exception, not to conferre with an infetiour in publike. His impudence will ouer-rule his ignorance to talke of learned principles; which come from him, like a treble part in a base voyce, too bigge for it. Liuing in some vnder-staire office, when he would visite the countrey, he borrowes some Gallants cast sute of his seruant, and therein (Player-like) acts that part among his besotted neighbours. When he rides his masters great horse out of ken, hee vaunts of him as his owne, and brags how much he cost him. He feeds vpon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers curtesie, others meat: and (whether more?) either fats him. At his Inne he cals for chiekens at spring, and such things as cannot be had; whereat angry, he sups according to his purse with a red Herring. Farre enough from know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, he talkes of his castle, (which is either in the aire, or inchanted) of his lands, which are some pastures in the Fairy-ground, inuisible, no where. He offers to purchase Lordships, but wants money for earnest. He makes others praises as introductions to his own, which must transcend; and cals for wine, that hee may make knowne his rare ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of deale at home: not forgetting to you, that a Dutch Marchant sent it him, for some extraordinary desert. He is a wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der euery where; among fooles, for his brauery, among wisemen for his folly. He loues an <hi>Herald</hi> for a new <hi>Coate,</hi>
                     <pb n="62" facs="tcp:488:36"/>
and hires him to lye vpon his Pedigree. All Nobility, that is ancient, is of his allyance; and the Great man is but of the first head, that doth not call him, <hi>Cousin.</hi> When his beames are weakest, like the rising and setting Sunne, hee makes the longest shadowes: whereas bright knowledge, like the Sunne at highest, makes none at all; though then most resultance of heat, and reflection of light. He takes great paines to make himselfe derisory; yet (without su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting it) both his speech and silence cries, Behold mee. He discommends earned worth with a shrugge, and lispes his enforced approbation. Hee loues humility in all men, but himselfe, as if hee did wish well to all soules but his owne.</p>
                  <p>There is no matter of consequence, that Policy begets, but he will be Gossip to, and giue it a name, and knowes the intention of all proiects, before they be full hatched. Hee hath somewhat in him, which would bee better for himselfe, and all men, if he could keepe it in. In his hall, you shal see an old rusty sword hung vp, which he swears killed <hi>Glendower</hi> in the hands of his Grandsire. He fathers vpon himselfe some villanies, because they are in fashion; and so vilifies his credit, to aduance it. If a newe famous <hi>Courteg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hian</hi> be mentioned, he deeply knowes her: whom indeede he neuer saw. He will be ignorant of nothing, though it be a shame to know it. His barrell hath a continual spigot, but no tunnell; and like an vnthrift, he spends more then he gets. His speech of himselfe is euer historicall, histrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall.

He loues no man a moment longer, then either he will tell him, or hears of him newes. If the spirit of his tong be once raised, all the company cannot coniure it downe.

Secondly, sometimes through hote distemper of the mouth. Thirdly, sometimes through corrupt and rotten humours in the mouth of the stomach. Fourthly, and not seldome through the exulceration of the lungs. The maine cause of <hi>Flattery</hi> is a kinde of selfe-loue; for he onely commends others, to mend himselfe. The <hi>communis terminus,</hi> where al his frauds, dissimulations, false phrases and praises, his admirations, and superlatiue title meete, is his purse. His tongue serues two Masters his great-ones eare, his owne auarice.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>Signes and Symptomes.</head>
                  <p>IF the cause of this <hi>Stench</hi> be in the mouth, it is discerned: if in the vicious stomake, or vlcerate lungs, it is allayd by eating; and not so forcible after meates as before. So the <hi>Flatterers</hi> stomake is well layd after dinner; and til he grow hungry againe, his adulatory pipes goe not so hotely. His meanes come by obseruance, and though hee waite not at table, he serues for a foole. He is after the nature of a Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; and first trimmes the head of his masters humour, and then sprinkles it with Court-water. He scrapes out his diet in curtsies; and cringeth to his glorious obiect, as a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Curre to a Mastiff: licking his hand, not with a healing, but poysoning tongue. <hi>Riches make many friends:</hi> truly; they are friends to the <hi>riches,</hi> not to the <hi>rich man.</hi> A great proud man, because hee is admired of a number of hang-byes, thinkes he hath <hi>many friends.</hi> So the Asse, that carryed the goddesse, thought all the knees bowed to her, when they reuerenced her burden. They play like flyes in his beams,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:488:39"/>
whiles his wealth warnes them. Whilst like some great Oke, he stands high and spreads farre in the forrest, innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable beasts shelter themselues vnder him, feeding like hogges on his acornes: but when the axe of distresse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to fell him, there is not one left to hinder the blowe. Like burres, they sticke no longer on his coate, then there is a nappe on it. These Kites would not flocke to him, but that he is a fat carkase. <hi>Seianus,</hi> whom the <hi>Romans</hi> worship in the morning as a <hi>Semi-god,</hi> before night they teare apie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.

                  <p>The <hi>Flatterer</hi> is young Gallants Schoole-master, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters them into booke-learning. Your cheating Trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man can no more bee without such a Factor, then an Vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer without a Broker. The Foxe (in the <hi>Fable)</hi> seeing the Crow highly perch'd, with a good morsell in his mouth, flattered him that he sung well, with no scant co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his voyce: wherof the Crow proud, began to make a noyse, and let the meat fall: the foolish bird seeing now himselfe deceiued, soone left singing, and the Foxe fell to eating. I need not morall it. The Instrument his tongue is tuned to anothers eare; but like a common fidler, he dares not an honest song. He lifts vp his Patrone at the tongues end, and sets him in a superlatiue height; like a Pharos, or the eye of the Countrey, when he's indeede the eye-sore. Hee sweares to him, that his commending any man is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue a Iustice of peaces letter; and that the eyes of the Parish waite vpon him for his grace. Hee insinuates his prayse, most from others report: wherein (very rankely) he wrongs three at once. He belyes the named commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the person to whom this commendation is sent, and most of all himselfe, the messenger. Whilst he supplies a man with the oyle of <hi>flatterie,</hi> hee wounds his heart; like thunder, which breakes the bone, without scratching the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:488:39"/>
skinne. Hee seldome speakes so pompously of his friend, except hee be sure of Porters to carry it him. Hee is the proud mans eare-wig, and hauing once gotten in, impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stumes his head. A continent man will easily find him; as knowing, that it is as euill, <hi>laudari à turpibus,</hi> as <hi>ob turpia.</hi> One being asked, which was the worst of beasts, answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; of wild beasts the <hi>Tyrant,</hi> of tame beasts the <hi>Flatterer.</hi> Like an ill Painter, because hee cannot draw a beautifull picture, he is euer limbing deformities and diuels: so the <hi>Flatterer,</hi> ignorant of goodnesse, layes faire colours vpon foule iniquities. This cunning wrastler stoopes lowe, to giue the greater fall, and wisheth to his obiect, as a whore to her Louer, abundance of all goods, except onely sober wits. Hee studies all the weeke for preuentions, to keepe his Patron on the Sunday from Church: a <hi>Sermon</hi> and hee are antipodes. Lest his Obserued should take him into the light, and looke on him, he keepes him perpetually hood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wink'd with the opinion of his owne knowledge; admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his deeds for sanctimonious, and his words for Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. Sometimes <hi>Conscience</hi> is his riuall-aduocate, and pleades against him in his Patrons heart: but because the Iudge is partiall on his side, and his periurous tale runs so smooth with the graine of his affections, hee giues <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> the check-mate. In short, hee is (at last) one way a <hi>Pandar,</hi> Cosenages Factor, sinnes Magician, and a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing murderer, that with arrident applauses tickles a man to death.</p>
