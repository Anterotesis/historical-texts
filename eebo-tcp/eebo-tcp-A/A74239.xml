            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>¶ A Proclamation of Grace and Pardon to all ſuch as ſhall returne to their Obedience, and ſubmit to, and ſeek His <hi>MAJESTIES</hi> mercy before the end of <hi>May</hi> next.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEREAS this unnaturall Rebellion was begun and fomented upon pretence of maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the true Proteſtant Religion, the Laws, Liberty and Property of the Subject, and the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of Parliament; And was heretofore carryed on in the name of the King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, upon pretence alſo of the preſervation of Our Honour, and the Rights of Our Crowne, and the Safety of Our Perſon, and redeeming it from the hands and power of evill Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors: And under theſe ſpecious pretences very many of Our Subjects have been miſled into it. But that which was at firſt known and foreſeen by ſome, may now be manifeſt to all, even of the meaneſt capacity, that theſe were but pretences to colour the Ambition, malice, and ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice of a few men; ſince it is apparent, that in the proſecution, and for the upholding of the Rebellion, there hath been more prophanation and ſcorne to the Proteſtant Religion here eſtabliſhed, more oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Subject, by depriving them of their Lives, Liberry and Property, without and againſt Law, and more uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation upon the Rights of Our Crowne, and violation of Lawes, and of Acts of Parliament, and of Priviledges of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament publiquely avowed, then can be parallell'd by any former example in this Kingdom. And upon Our ſeverall Meſſages and Invitations for a Treaty for Peace, nothing is propounded to Us, and inſiſted upon, concerning the breach of any Law, or the Liberty, or Property of the Subject, or the Priviledges of Parliament; But changes in the Religion eſtabliſhed, and alterations of the ancient Government of this Kingdome both in Church and State. And touching the defence and ſafety of Our Perſon, notwithſtanding Our earneſt endeavours for Peace, this Rebellion is ſtill proſecuted, and new Armies now moulded, and Forces raiſed under the name of the Parliament and State, with Commiſsion to kill and deſtroy, without exception or regard of Our Perſon: So that (beſide the Tryalls We have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready undergone) We may eaſily diſcerne what ſafety or defence We are to expect hereafter. And it is evident that the deſigne tends to the deſtruction, not onely of Our Perſon and Poſterity, but even of Monarchy it ſelfe: and that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the true Proteſtant Religion eſtabliſhed, of the Lawes, Liberty and Property of the Subject, of the juſt Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of Parliament, and of Our Perſon, and the Rights of Our Crowne, are laid aſide, and can be no longer preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for this Rebellion. And whereas We have reaſon to beleeve that very many of Our Subjects, who were heretofore ſeduced, and miſled, are by this, and their own manifold ſufferings, brought to a ſight of their error, and to a diſlike and deteſtation of this execrable Rebellion, which threatens ſpeedy Ruine and deſtruction to the Nation: but being hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore involved and intangled in the guilt of it, are doubtfull of their owne ſecurity, and cannot eaſily find the way to free themſelves with ſafety. In purſuance therefore of Our conſtant purpoſe, to omit nothing which We ſhall conceive may give ſecurity to thoſe Our Subjects, who ſhall not ſtill wilfully and malitiouſly perſiſt in miſchiefe, and which may conduce to the quenching of this Fire, and reſtoring Peace to Our People in all Our Dominions, We have thought fit once againe to ſet forth this Our Proclamation of Grace and Pardon: And We doe hereby Publiſh and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, That to all ſuch of what eſtate, degree, or condition ſoever they be (without exception) who ſhall before the end of <hi>May</hi> next enſuing, returne to their due Obedience, and ſubmit to, and deſire Our Mercy, We ſhall grant them Our free and gracious Pardon for all offences whatſoever, committed or done, in or by the proſecuring, promoting, aſſiſting, or countenancing of this Rebellion, or which have any relation thereunto. And this in the Word of a King We ſhall effectually make good unto them.</p>
