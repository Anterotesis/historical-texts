            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The tree of sound Religion flourisheth
<pb facs="tcp:5528:9"/>
in your bosome, and beareth (both in the eie of man (out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly) and (inwardly) to God) much, and very much good fruit. You thereby proue your selfe a confirmed Christian: and shall giue further testimonie of your being so, if you incourage o<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thers (that are weake) to feed vpon this milke for babes, by tasting of it your selfe. They (by you) shall be led into the path of goodnes, if you but vouchsafe to walk out before them, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the way. Foure Birds (of <hi>Noahs</hi> Arke) haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken foure seueral flights. The Doue (which is the first) flies to your hand; not by chance,

but vpon good choice, as knowing you to be a Doue your selfe. The badge which a Doue weares, is innocence: and by wearing that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Armor, you defended your selfe, and returned safe out of the Lions denne with <hi>Daniel,</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it was thought you should haue bin deuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Rayer, is the language in which we talk to God: for when we read (the Booke) God speaketh to vs, but when we Pray, wee speake to him: It is therefore a dialogue between him and vs. It is that leader which <hi>Iacob</hi> saw ascending vp to the clouds, for by the staires of it do we climb vp to heauen. Prayer is the key that opens all the gates of heauen. It is the compasse by which we saile thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. It is the badge by which a Christian is knowen that he
<pb facs="tcp:5528:13"/>
serueth God. It is our best friend that speaketh to him in our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe. It is the eloquence that onely ouercommeth him. It is the musicke, that only charmes his anger to sleepe. It is our peace-maker, in the warres be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene God and vs. It is the sword of defence in the combat betweene vs and the diuell. It is the ship, in which if our soule sailes not, we perish. It is the anchor, at which we lie safe in the stormes of death. It is the balme that cureth the wounds of pouertie, of oppression, of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment, of banishment, of despaire, of cares, of sorowes &amp; of all calamities, that like dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases hang vpon our life. Such is Prayer, such armor must we put on if wee meane to winne Heauen.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Doue was the first Bird that being sent out of <hi>Noah</hi> his Arke, brought comfort to <hi>Noah:</hi> So Prayer being sent out of the Arke of our bodyes, is the onely and first bringer of comfort to vs from Heauen. The Doue went out twice ere it could finde an Oliue Branch, (which was the ensigne of

Take away from him (that is, my master) all thoughts of crueltie, that like the children of Israel vnder the subiection of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, I may not be set to a taske aboue my strength: of if I be; stretch thou out my sinewes (O God) that I

Fill my veynes with blood, that that I may goe thorow the hardest labours: sithence it is a law set downe by thy selfe, that I must earne my bread with the sweat of my owne browes. Giue mee courage to beginne: pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to goe forward: and abilitie to finish them. Cleanse my heart (O thou that art the fountaine of purity) from all falsehood, from all swearing, from all abuse of thy sacred Name, from all foule, loose and vnreuerend languages.

Take sloth from my fingers, and drowsinesse from the lids of mine eye; whether I rise early, or lie downe late, so gladly let me doe it, as if my prenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship were to bee consumed in thy seruice. The glasse of my yeares shal thereby run out in pleasure, &amp; I in the end shall be made free of that citie of thine, <hi>The hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Ierusalem</hi>; into whose fellowship, I beseech thee, to enfranchise &amp; enrol me, and that after I haue faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully laboured six dayes of my life here vpon earth, I may vpon the seuenth rest in thy euerlasting Sabbath.

Thou (that art God the sonne) of all those that are of thy fold, art the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liest-minded; but that is to instruct vs (thy children) in obedience.

and in thy wisedome and compassion didst consent that all the health of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind should consist in the death of thy blessed Sonne. Wee were the arch-tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, but hee answered all our treasons at a most dreadfull barre. Wee had transgressed, but hee was the Lamb that was to bee sacraficed. Glorified bee thy Name for being so full of pitie: Glorified be thy Sonnes death, for being so full of charitable pietie. For let vs reckon before thee (O Father) and betweene vs &amp; our soules, how much we are indebted for this thy Sonnes suretie-ship. Wee owed all, and hee payed the vtmost farthing. Let vs

By his death wee are ingrafted into the Tree of life, his blood doeth giue it nourishment. His nailing on the crosse cleft the dores of hell in sunder, and set wide open the gates of heauen: Christ by this meanes is become our way, our guide, our hauen. Would we walke safely? Christ is our path: would we not stumble? Cstrist is our leader: would wee not be cast away? Christ is our Pilot.</p>

Before wee liued in slauerie, but now we dwell within the liberties of the holy citie.

To quit which loue of his (albeit there is nothing in vs of value that can giue him satisfaction) yet rather then to pay no part of the debt, let vs tender downe so much as wee can make.

of his apprehension with bils and staues: It was a deed of darkenesse, and therfore done in the night. When wee doe but stretch foorth our armes, let vs call to mind how hee was rac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked vpon the crosse. The branches of these medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions shall beare this fruit; by turning ouer the leaues of his death and passion, we shall still read the storie of our owne end: and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can more fright a man out of the companie of sinne, then when hee looketh vpon that which he is sure to goe to, and that is his graue: so to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate, is to liue well: so to liue, is to die well; for no pil remaines to make death
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:5528:118"/>
taste bitter afterward, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse it were taken downe before. He that thus fights is sure to conquer: he that thus conquers is sure to be crowned; he that is ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious of that crowne, will desire to bee dissolued and to be with Christ: hee that so desires, doeth not die pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently, but hee liues pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, and dieth ioyfully. Such a death, O Lord, let me die, for in the sepulcher of thy Sonne, death (that once was terrible) is swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed vp: so that now we may triumphantly sing, Where is thy sting, O death?

                  <p>A dreadfull thing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore would it bee to dwell in this land of euerlasting silence and darkenesse, but
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:5528:120"/>
that Christ himselfe hath gone thither before vs. How infinitelie are wee bound to him, that (in this battell of death) wee are not thrust vpon any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but what he hath gone thorow. How aboue mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure doeth hee loue vs, to trie the ice first, before he suffer vs to venture ouer? Hee went into the graue before vs, to shew that we all must follow him. But what riches may we gather out of this his sepulcher? What treasure lieth hid in these coffins of the dead? This cleere gaines we ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; this profitable know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge wee gaine, that as <hi>Adam</hi> was made of a piece

of clay, so all the sonnes of <hi>Adam</hi> must crumble into dust. The wombes of our mothers are the first lodgings that wee lie in, and the womb of the earth is appointed to be the last.

                  <p>Yet suffer vs, O Lord, not to repine, whether in the morning, at noone, or at mid night, that is to say, in our cradle, in our youth, or old age, wee go to take our long sleepe, but let vs make this reckoning of our yeres, that if we can

liue no longer, that is vnto vs our old age; for hee that liueth so long as thou ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointest him (though hee die in the pride of his beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie) dieth an olde man. Sithence then that wormes must bee our last compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, &amp; that the pillowes vpon which wee are to rest for euer, are within but dead mens sculles, whereof should wee bee proud? Why should wee disdaine the poorest begger? when the hand that swayes a Scepter, and the hand that holdes a sheepe-hooke, be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing found together in the earth are both alike. What madnesse is it so to pamper the flesh with curious

meates, and costly wines, when (doe what we can) we do but fatten it for craw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vermine? What folly is it, to cloth our bodie in sumptuous attires, when (let them be neuer so gorgeous) we shall carry with vs but a winding-sheete? Why doe we bathe our limmes in sweete waters, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balme our bodies with rich perfumes, when no carion in the world can smel more noisome, then must our carcases? Blessed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bee the sepulcher that held our Sauiours bodie, sithence it is a booke wherein wee may learne how to contemne this foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish loue of our selues.

Redeemer? For now is he sure, that his body fals not like the body of a beast (for then his estate were more then most wretched) but that the Lord killeth, and maketh aliue againe, and that he bringeth downe to the graue, and fetcheth vp againe. My Redeemer now liueth, and by his life, doe I know that I shall rise out of the earth at the latter day; and that I shall bee clothed againe in my frailtie, as my Sauiour was at his resurrection in his owne flesh.

The cogitation of this his resurrection, and so conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of our owne cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vp from death to life, is a spurre vnto vs whilst we are vpon earth, to runne the race of blessednes.

The resurrection of Christ is our hope, but the ascensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christ is our glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. He ascended into heauen; but how? he shut not the gates of heauen vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon vs, but of purpose went thither to make the way plaine before vs. His bodie is in heauen, but his maiesty abides vpon earth. Here hee was once accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the flesh, and here he is still according to his

Thine eies haue sight too weake to pierce thorow the clouds; his brightnes is too great, and would strik thee blind with dazeling: thy hands are too short to reach vp to the seat where he sits; and thine armes not of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe bigge enough to bee throwne about his bodie. But let thy faith open her eyes, for shee can behold him: let thy faith put out her hand, and with the least finger she can touch him. As our forefathers held him in the flesh, so we must
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:5528:126"/>
hold him in our hearts. By his ascending vp into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen are we sure that he is the very Son of God: for none can ascend thither, but hee that comes from thence. Celebrate therefore this his ascension with faith, and with deuotion, and thou shalt presently be in heauen with him. There he sitteth at the right hand of his father, like an Attur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in our behalf, pleading for mercy; and like a peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner, stil preferring vp our prayers and complaints to his heauenly father. How happy is man to haue such a speaker for him? How mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable were man, if Christ were not his Interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siour? Sithence then that
