            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>What true Chriſtian can reade or hear ſuch things
as theſe without much trouble of ſoul and ſpirituall
indignation? How can the Friends of Chriſt chuſe
but endeavour the ſtopping of this mouth of Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies?
But alas, for ſome years laſt paſt, either
there have been none that could or at leaſt that would
do it; So that the children of <hi>Zion</hi> have only ſpread
the blaſphemies and errours of the time before their
God, who in anſwer to their praiers, we hope, hath
by his Providence aſſembled you, conjoyned, and
united your Powers and Councels, to try if you will
own him as your King, by ſuppreſſing the grand
Traitors and Treaſons againſt his Majeſty. Will
Heathens allow men to blaſpheme their falſe gods?
Oh ye Rulers of theſe Nations, <hi>kiſſe the Son lest he
be angry, and ye periſh in the way;</hi> and if your rule,
power, ſitting, ſhould miſcarry upon this account,
you will come off with more honour and quie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
conſciences then ſhall accompany any Succeſſor
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98248:7"/>
or Succeſſors in his or their taking part with
the enemies of God by a boundleſſe Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>And now we hope your Highneſſe and your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
will conſider, that the Printing and Publiſhing
ſo many thouſands of ſuch Books aforeſaid, argues
that there are many buyers, and the many buyers ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
a great infection by them, which like a Gangrene
ſpreads more and more, and chiefly in <hi>London</hi> and
the North parts of <hi>England,</hi> where there was a meeting
lately of about Two thouſand Quakers. And that
this four leaven threatens the leavening of the whole
lump, and that too ſoon, though it ſhould not be
compleated untill by age or death you be called off the
ſtage, when the Lord ſhall examin how you have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
your Talent: And what a Popiſh, or what a
Paganiſh Parliament ſhall we have then, if any?
Where then will be our Laws, Magiſtrates, Religion,
Miniſtry, Liberties, Strength, when a Papiſt or a <hi>Nero,</hi>
taking the advantage of our confuſion, ſhall get into
the ſaddle, though by the ſtirrup of a pretended Fifth
Monarchy? If you ſhould judge us too preſumptuous
in this addreſſe (as we hope you will not) our apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie
is, that through grace we are Chriſtians, that
judge it no great adventure to appear before the Rulers
of this world in ſo good a cauſe, ſith we are uſed to
frequent admittance into the preſence of the King of
Kings our dear Lord and Maſter. And if it ſhall be
blamed as diſcovering the nakedneſſe and wounds of
our dear Country, to the Churches and Nations round
about; we hope that reaſon will plead for us, that
you cannot cure theſe wounds untill they be diſcover'd
and ſearch'd; and that if ſuch Books and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous

Opinions were not ſuffered to be ſpread all the
Land over, we had not troubled You with the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them.</p>
            <p>The Premiſes conſidered, we humbly renew our
Petition to his Highneſſe the Lord Protector and the
Honourable Parliament, and heartily implore You <hi>by
God and Mans Expectations, your own publique Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsions
and Engagements, and as ever you expect to
appear before God with comfort, who hath put power
into your hands to doe much for his beloved Spouſe
and Cauſe;</hi> That you would ſtir up your ſtrength and
your zeal againſt the Enemies of both the ſouls
and bodies of the people of this Commonwealth; by
ſuppreſſing of Popiſh, Blaſphemous, Antimagiſtratical
and Antiminiſteriall Books, which are the nurſery of
Errour, Idolatry and Rebellion, Putrefaction and
Shame of a Nation, Provocation of Divine vengeance,
and high-way to eternall perdition. And to the end
ſo good a work may be accompliſhed, and effectuall
means may be applied, we ſhall humbly offer our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals
(if commanded) how it may be done, without
any trouble to the State; In the mean time begging
leave, that without offence we may ſay, we humbly
conceive, that we ſhall deſpair of ever ſeeing a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Redreſſe in this caſe, unleſſe the way of Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
Books, by faithfull able men that are ſound in the

Printed and Publiſhed, any Book not Licenſed; and
the ſaid Penalty to be recovered by any that ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute
the Offender at the Common-Law, with good
encouragement to the Proſecuter.</p>
