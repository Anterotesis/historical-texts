            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A true Relation of the Voyage undertaken by me <hi>Robert Fowler,</hi> with my ſmall Veſſel called the <hi>Woodhouſe,</hi> but performed by the Lord, like as he did <hi>Noahs</hi> Ark, wherein he ſhut up a few righteous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and landed them as ſafe, even as at the Hill <hi>Ararat.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>The true Diſcourſe taken as followeth:</p>
            <p>THis Veſſel was appointed for this ſervice from the beginning, as I have often had it manifeſted unto me, that it was ſaid within me ſeveral times, <hi>Thou hath her not for nothing,</hi> and alſo <hi>New-England</hi> preſented before me; alſo when ſhe was finiſhed and fraughted, and made to Sea, contrary to my will, was brought to <hi>London,</hi> where ſpeaking touching this matter to <hi>Gerrard Roberts</hi> and others, who confirmed the matter in behalf of the Lord, that it muſt be ſo; yet entring into reaſoning, and letting in temptations and hardſhips, and the loſs of my life, wife and children, with the enjoyments of all earthly things, it brought me as low as the grave, and laid me as one dead, as to the things of God, but by his Inſtrument <hi>G. F.</hi> was I refreſhed and raiſed up again, which before that it was much contrary to my ſelf, that I could as wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly have died, as have gone, but by the ſtrength of God I was made willing to do his will; yea, the cuſtoms and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions of the Cuſtom-Houſe could not ſtop me: ſtill was I aſſaulted with the Enemy, who preſſed from me my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, ſo that for this long Voyage we were but two men and three boys, beſides my ſelf. Upon the firſt day of the fourth Moneth received I the Lords ſervants aboard, who came with a mighty hand and an out-ſtretched arm with
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:105847:3"/>
them, ſo that with courage we ſet Sayl and came into the <hi>Downs</hi> the ſecond day, where our dearly beloved <hi>W. D.</hi> with <hi>Mich. Tomſon</hi> came aboard, and in them we were much refreſhed, and after recommending us to the grace of God, we lanched forth: Again reaſon entred upon me, and thoughts roſe in me to have gone to the Admiral, and have made my complaint for the want of my ſervants and a Convoy, from which thing was I withholden by that hand which was my helper: Shortly after the South winde blew a little hard, ſo that it cauſed us to put in at <hi>Ports<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> where I was furniſhed with choice of men, according to one of the Captains words to me, <hi>That I might have enough for money,</hi> but he ſaid my Veſſel was ſo ſmall, he would not go the Voyage for her. Certain days we lay there, wherein the Miniſters of Chriſt were not idle, but went forth and gathered ſticks, and kindled a fire, and left it burning; alſo ſeveral friends came aboard and viſited us, in which we were refreſhed: Again we lanched from thence about the eleventh day, and was put back again into <hi>South-Yarmouth,</hi> where we went aſhore, and in ſome meaſure did the like; alſo we met with three pretty large ſhips, which were for the <hi>New-found Land,</hi> who did accompany us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 50 leagues, but might have done 300, if they had not feared the Men of War, but for eſcaping them they took to the Northwards, and left us without hope of help to the outward, which before our parting it was ſhewed to <hi>H. N.</hi> early in the morning, that they were nigh unto us that ſought our lives, and called unto me, and told me, but ſaid he, thus ſaith the Lord, You ſhall be carryed away as in a Miſt, and preſently we eſpied a great Ship making up towards us, and the three great Ships were much afraid, and tacked about with what ſpeed they could for it; in the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:105847:3"/>
very interim the Lord God fulfilled his promiſe, and ſtruck our enemies in the face with a contrary wind, wonderfully to our refreſhment; then upon our parting from theſe three Ships, we were brought to ask counſel at the Lord, and the word was from him, <hi>Cut through, and ſteer your ſtreighteſt courſe, and minde nothing but me,</hi> unto which thing he much provoked us, and cauſed us to meet together every day, and he himſelf met with us, and manifeſted himſelf largely unto us, ſo that by ſtorms we were not prevented above three times in all our Voyage; The Sea was my figure, for if any thing got up within, the Sea without roſe up againſt me, and then the Floods clapt their hands, of which in time I took notice, and told <hi>H. N.</hi> Again in a viſion in the night I ſaw ſome Anchors ſwimming above the water, and ſome thing alſo of a Ship which croſt our way, which in our mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting I ſaw fulfilled, for I my ſelf with others, had loſt ours, ſo that for a little ſeaſon the Veſſels run looſe in a maner, which afterwards by the wiſdom of God was recovered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a better condition then before: Alſo upon the twenty fifth day of the ſame moneth in the morning, we ſaw an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other great Veſſel making up towards us, which did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear a far off to have been a Frigot, and made her ſign for us to come to them, which unto me was a great croſs, we being to windward of them; and it was ſaid, <hi>Go ſpeak him, the croſs is ſure, did I ever fail thee therein?</hi> and unto others there appeared no danger in it, ſo that we did, and it proved a Tradeſman of <hi>London,</hi> by whom we writ back; Alſo it is very remarkable, when we had been five weeks at Sea in a dark ſeaſon, wherein the powers of darkneſs appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the greateſt ſtrength againſt us, having ſayled but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 300 leagues, <hi>H. N.</hi> falling into communion with God, told me that he had received a comfortable Anſwer, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:105847:4"/>
alſo that about ſuch a day we ſhould land in <hi>America,</hi> which was even ſo fulfilled; Alſo thus it was all the Voyage with the faithful, which were carried far above ſtorms and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts, that when the Ship went either to the right or left hand, their lines joyned all as one, and did direct her way, ſo that we have ſeen and ſaid, we ſee the Lord lead our Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, even as it were a man leading a horſe by the head, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding neither latitude nor longitude, but kept to our Line, which was, and is our Leader, Guide and Rule, but they that did, failed. Upon the laſt day of the fifth moneth we made land, it was part of the <hi>Long Iſland,</hi> far contrary to the expectation of the Pylot; Furthermore our drawing had been all the Voyage to keep to the Southwards, until the evening before we made land, and then the word was, <hi>There is a Lion in the way,</hi> unto which Lion we gave obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and ſaid, Let them ſteer Northwards until the day following, and ſoon after the middle of the day, there was drawings to meet together before our uſual time, and it was ſaid, That we may look abroad in the evening, and as we ſate waiting upon the Lord, they diſcovered the land, and our mouthes was opened in Prayer and Thankſgiving; as way was made, we made towards it, and eſpying a Creek, our advice was to enter there, but the will of man reſiſted, but in that eſtate we had learned to be content, and told him both ſides was ſafe, but going that way would be more trouble to him; alſo he ſaw after he had laid by all the night, the thing fulfilled.</p>
            <p>Now to lay before you in ſhort, the largeneſs of the Wiſdom, Will and Power of God, Thus this Creek led us in between the <hi>Dutch Plantation</hi> and <hi>Long Iſland,</hi> where the moving of ſome friends whereunto, which
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:105847:4"/>
otherwiſe had been very difficult for them to have gotten too: Alſo the Lord God that moved them, brought them to the place appointed, and us into our way, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the word which came to <hi>C. H. You are in the road to Road Iſland.</hi> In that Creek came a Shallop to meet us, taking us to be ſtrangers, making our way with our Boat, and they ſpoke Engliſh unto us, and informed us, and alſo guided us along: The power of the Lord fell much upon us, and an unreſiſtable word came unto us, <hi>That the Seed in</hi> America <hi>ſhall be as the ſand of the ſea.</hi> It was publiſhed in the ears of the Brethren, which cauſed tears to break forth with fulneſs of joy, ſo that preſently for theſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces they prepared themſelves, which were <hi>Robert Hog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen, Richard Dowdney, Sarah Gibbins, Mary Witherhead,</hi> and <hi>Dorothy Waugh,</hi> which the next day were put ſafely aſhore: Into the Dutch Plantation called <hi>New Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> we came, and it being the firſt day of the week, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral came aboard on us, and we begun our work: I was cauſed to go to the Governor, and <hi>Robert Hoggen</hi> with me; he was moderate both in words and actions. <hi>Robert</hi> and I had ſeveral days before ſeen in a viſion the Veſſel in great danger; the day following this was fulfilled, there being a paſſage between two Lands, which is called by the name of <hi>Hell-gate,</hi> we happened very conveniently of a Pylot, and into that place we came, and into it were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and over it was carried, which I never heard of any before that was; and the Scripture is fulfilled in our eyes, in the Figure, <hi>Hells gates</hi> cannot prevail againſt you: rocks many on both ſides, ſo that I believe one yards length, would have endangered loſs of both Veſſel and Goods; Alſo there were a ſcull of fiſhes purſued our Veſſel, and followed her ſtrongly, and along cloſe by our Rudder;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:105847:5"/>
and in our meeting it was ſhewed me, Theſe fiſhes is to thee a Figure, Thus doth the Prayers of the Churches proceed to the Lord for thee and the reſt: ſurely in our meeting did the thing run through me as oyl, and did me much rejoyce.</p>
