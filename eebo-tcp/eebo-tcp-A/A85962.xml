         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Firſt, provide a peece of Ground where the Sun lies upon it, and for the better ordering, take a Brick-maker, or a Labourer to doe it: Doe thus,</p>
            <p>Take three Load of <hi>red Morter,</hi> ſuch as you make Bricks with double Loads, half a Chaldron of good <hi>Seacoales</hi> of the ſmalleſt and beſt, three Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulls of the beſt <hi>Smalcoale,</hi> foure buſhels of <hi>Saw-duſt,</hi> foure truſſes of <hi>Straw</hi> chopped; worke all theſe together with water ſtiffe as Bricks, then when it is worked all together very well, take foure ſacks of the duſt of <hi>Smalcoale,</hi> and with that uſed as they do the Sand for caſting of Brick; then caſt the Ingredients as you caſt Brick, but halfe ſo thick, and dry it as Brick is dryed; or you may make it up in round Balls not too big, with Charcoale, or Smalcoale duſt, on the outſide, and ſo laid to dry, when they be thorow d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y, burn them with a little Scotch-coale, or Wood, or any Combuſtible matter to fire it, or with two or three wooden chips to kindle your fire withall, and to keepe in the life of the fire, and theſe caſt a moſt excellent heat, and keepe fire for any uſe, to Roſt, Boile, or Bake, for the richer ſort; but bee ſure you lay them not too cloſe on the fire, but as you ſee your pattern upon this Paper, mingled with a Scotch-coale or two.</p>
            <p>For the Poorer ſort, Cow-dung mingled with Saw-duſt and Smalcoale, made up into Bals, or in a ſquare like a Tile, not too thick, and dryed, make a very good Fewell, but ſomething noiſome. Alſo that which comes out of the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Horſe-dung in Balls with Saw-duſt, or the duſt of Smalcoale, or Charcoale duſt, dryed, is good Fewell, but the ſmell is offenſive.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Greenwich</hi> Heath, or <hi>Hounſlow</hi> Heath Turfe well dryed, is very good fewell, with a little Scotch-coale burnt with it.</p>
            <p>Peate if well dryed, but well fatted with ſeggy or flagge roots from Fenny places, is a very good firing, mingled with Coale when it is burnt.</p>
            <p>Some make an Oven with Kennell durt, with a hole at the top for the heat and ſmoke to aſcend up in the chimny, and with ſix or ſeven bricks raiſe the bottome and make up the ſhed, and then daube up the oven, leaving the hole at top, and before put in a few Scotch-coale, and after it is kindled will keepe fire a weeke, every two dayes putting addition of the kennell durt to keep it whole, and putting Seacoale, or Scocth-coale as the fire declines; this is a fire which caſts a good heat at the mouth and top, but not commendable nor fit to roſt.</p>
            <p>Above all things let mee perſwade all men to ſweepe their Chimneys cleane againſt winter, for with Scotch-coale, or Coale minged with wood, or with any of theſe <hi>Chimneys</hi> grow extraordinary foule; and he that meanes to keepe his houſe from firing, let him bee ſure to keepe his Chimney cleane: Thus if thou makeſt uſe, thou ſhalt ſee thy labour worth thy paines, and bee thankfull to him that hath been the Inſtructer, for this Artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Fire.</p>
