            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Pamphlet on which theſe <hi>Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
are written, hath ſo long ſince re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
its doom (for it was deſigned to
put a ſtop to the many Loyal Addreſſes
which then came in every day: And ſo every one that
ſucceeded it, gave it a moral wound, by declaring to the
World its weakneſs and folly) that it may ſeem a piece
of impertinence in me to drag it into the light again, tho
with an intent to expoſe it the more to the juſt Recent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of all good Subjects; wherefore for my own ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification
I think my ſelf bound to aſſign the Cauſes, why
ſo late, and why at all?</p>
            <p>Know then Reader, that this ſame Libel, entituled,
<hi>A juſt and modeſt Vindication,</hi> &amp;c. was Printed near
Six months before ever I heard there was any ſuch thing
in the World: and it was near Six more before I could
get a ſight of it, tho I uſed all the intereſt I could make,
to borrow or buy it.</p>
            <p>When I had it, and had read it over once or twice, I
then reſolved to make ſome ſhort <hi>Reflections</hi> upon it,
and put them as a Preface to the third Part of the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs
to the Freemen and Freeholders of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
which was then going to the Preſs; but being
<pb facs="tcp:56346:3"/>
preſſed at the ſame time with an earneſt deſire to leave
no material paſſage in the Libel unexamined, and
wanting ſtill to bring a juſt Anſwer to it within the
compaſs of a Preface to that Book, it ſwelled to ſuch a
bulk, that it was totally unfit for that purpoſe; ſo I
thought it was better either to Print it alone, or to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
it.</p>
            <p>To which purpoſe I ſent it up about <hi>Michaelmas</hi> laſt
to <hi>London,</hi> to a Perſon of great worth and judgment
to peruſe it, and paſs a final Sentence on it, but his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
buſineſs prevented him from ſo doing till almoſt ſix
months after.</p>
            <p>And by that time I cannot deny but that (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the favourable opinion my worthy Friend was
pleaſed to paſs upon it) it ſeemed to me almoſt Antiquated,
and upon that account I would certainly have huſhed it up
in everlaſting ſilence, if I had not at the ſame time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,
that the ill Principles this Libel hath ſown in the
minds of men, are like Seeds which lie buried in the Earth
during the Winter, but if the Soil happen to be ſtirred
again, and then the Rain and Sun give their aſſiſtance,
they will certainly ſpring up, and produce a plentiful Crop
of pernicious Weeds to annoy and diſquiet the Nation:
And I am not without all hopes that theſe Reflections may
by Gods bleſſing prevent ſome part of this miſchief; and
although I ſhould be miſtaken in the Event, yet I am ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
the Deſign is good.</p>
            <p>How well or ill I have performed what I undertook

ON A
PAMPHLET,
STILED
A Juſt and Modeſt Vindication of the Proceedings of the
Two laſt PARLIAMENTS:
BEING
A defence of his Majeſties Declaration.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Author, who by his ſtile and the manner
in which he treats all thoſe that have the
misfortune to fall under his Cenſure, appears
to be no mean perſon; ſeems every where
throughout the whole Diſcourſe to be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
with ſo much Anger and Rage; that he was neither
maſter of his own Reaſon, nor able to uſe that Learning
he had to any good purpoſe: From whence we may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
it hapned, that putting the Title of his Book in the
firſt lines of it, he never more thought of the <hi>Juſtice</hi> or
<hi>Modeſty</hi> pretended, but a Vindicative Spirit took ſuch poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
of him, as he never became his own man after.
My Reader therefore, I hope, will pardon me, if his Paſſion
happens to move one in me, in any part of theſe Reflections;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56346:5"/>
becauſe is is difficult to converſe patiently with a man of
this temper.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He begins thus:</hi> The Amazement which ſeized every good
man, upon the unlooked-for diſſolution of two Parliaments
within three Months, was not greater than at the ſight of a
Declaration pretending to juſtifie and give Reaſons for ſuch
extraordinary proceedings.</p>
            <p>Thus my Author comes ſtaring upon the Stage, as one
newly recovered out of one Amazement, and juſt then
taken with another, he fanſies all the good men of the
Nation under the ſame diſtraction of mind. And what
was it that wrought ſo powerfully on him, that every man
that was not ſo affected deſerved not the Title of a <hi>Good
Man?</hi> Nothing in the world but the Diſſolution of the two
laſt Parliaments, and the ſight of the before-mentioned De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration.
A frightful ominous ſight! He tells us after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
there never appeared ſuch a Prodigy before,<note place="margin">Pag. 3.</note> but in
1628. and that was one of the firſt ſad Cauſes (though
he does not prove it to be ſo much as an Occaſion) of the
enſuing <hi>unhappy War;</hi> a ſoft name for a <hi>Rebellion,</hi> which as
good men never had Cauſe, ſo ill men never wanted a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
to ſtir up.</p>
            <p>I can aſſure him that there were many good men who
obſerved all this as well as he, who did not inſtantly fall
into fits upon it. Good men can truſt God and their King,
and reſt quietly and free from <hi>Amazement</hi> in greater Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
than theſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Having a little recovered himſelf out of the Muſe he
was in, thus he proceeds.</hi> It is not to be denied but that our
Kings have in a great meaſure been intruſted with the power of
Calling, and Declaring the Diſſolutions of Parliaments.
Have they ſo? Whoſe Truſtees are they? When did they firſt
obtain this favour?</p>
            <p>I proteſt now I was ſo dull as to think that this right of
Calling and Diſſolving Parliaments was a Natural Right,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56346:5"/>
inherent in the Crown,<note place="margin">Pro. Dom. Rege dicit, quod cum placeat ei, Parliament ſuum tenere pro utilitate Regní ſui, de Regali poteſtate ſuâ facit ſummoneri ubi &amp; quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do, <hi>&amp;c</hi> pro voluntate ſua. <hi>Cok. Juriſdict. p.</hi> 16.</note> and as old as the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh
Monarchy, and that at the granting of the
great Charter, and at all other times before or
ſince, when the Kings of <hi>England</hi> granted
any <hi>new Priviledges to their Subjects</hi> they
ſtill reſerved to the Crown the power of calling
Parliaments when and where they pleaſed, and to continue
them as long as they thought fit, and then to Diſſolve or
Prorogue them. Well, but if I was therein miſtaken, yet
he allows our Kings a great <hi>meaſure</hi> of that truſt, and who
claims the Remainder of it? Not the Petitioners, I hope.
No, the Privy Council, he tells us, are to be adviſed with.
Now that is matter of Expedience only, not of Right; for
whatever His Majeſty can lawfully do with, doubtleſs he
may as lawfully (though not in all caſes and circumſtances
ſo prudently) do without, the Advice of his Privy-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,

So I agree with him that there are two Statutes provided
for the holding of Parliaments Annually, <hi>and more often if
need be,</hi> of which the Kings of <hi>England</hi> have ever ſince
thought themſelves the Judges. But where are the Statutes
to be found that theſe Parliaments ſhould not be prorogued
nor diſſolved till <hi>ALL the Petitions and Bills before them
were anſwered and redreſſed?</hi> Here is not one tittle of this
in either of theſe he quotes, yet that is the main thing in
controverſie, and which only needed proving. But he
goes on. <hi>The Conſtitution had been equally imperfect and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive
of it ſelf, had it been left to the choice of the Prince
whether he would ever Summon a Parliament; or put into his
power to diſmiſs them Arbitrarily at his pleaſure.</hi> Then ſure
it had been worth the while to have proved for what time
they were to ſit, as well as how often. And if this can
be made out that it is an Arbitrary, that is, in the ſenſe
he would be underſtood in, an Illegal Act, for the King
to prorogue or diſſolve a Parliament, till <hi>all the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions
and Bills be anſwered and redreſſed,</hi> then will it be
poſſible for a Parliament to perpetuate it ſelf for ever by
an endleſs ſucceſſion of Petitions and Bills mixed with other
great affairs, which as it is contrary to the practice of all
our Kings ſince theſe Statutes, ſo if it were true, the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy
wuld not then be what it now is; but be much
nearer a Commonwealth. So that be the Conſequence
what it will, this learned Gentleman muſt yield, that it is at
the choice of our Princes to ſummon Parliaments when
they think it needful; and to diſmiſs them when they
pleaſe. As for the word <hi>Arbitrarily,</hi> which he here uſeth,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56346:6"/>
it is needleſs; and was ſuggeſted to him by his Spleen, and
and not by his Reaſon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That Parliaments ſhould thus meet</hi> (Annually) <hi>and thus
ſit,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 2.</note> (till all the Petitions and Bills before them are anſwered
and redreſſed) <hi>is ſecured to us by the ſame ſacred tye by which
the King at his Coronation does oblige himſelf, to let his Judges
ſit to diſtribute Juſtice every Term, and to preſerve inviclably
all other Rights and Liberties of his Subjects.</hi> I thought the
Law had been altered a little in the firſt particular, by a
Statute made in the Seventeenth year of his now Majeſties
Reign. <hi>Cap.</hi> 1. the words of which are as followeth. <hi>And,
becauſe by the Ancient Laws and Statutes of this
Realm, made in the Reign of King</hi> Edward <hi>the
Third, Parliaments are to be held very often, Your
Majeſties humble and loyal Subjects the Lords Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titual
and Temporal, and the Commons in this
preſent Parliament aſſembled, moſt humbly do
beſeech your moſt Excellent Majeſty,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the ſitting and holding of Parliaments ſhall
not be intermitted or diſcontinued above three years
at moſt, but that within three years from and after
the Determination of this preſent Parliament, and
ſo from time to time within three years after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
of any other Parliament or Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
or if there be occaſion more or oftener, your
Majeſty your Heirs and Succeſſors do iſſue out your
Writs for calling, aſſembling, and holding of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
Parliament, to the end there may be a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
calling, aſſembling, and holding of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
once in three years at leaſt.</hi> So that ſurely his
Majeſty may without breach of his Coronation Oath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
the calling of a Parliament three years, if there be no
occaſion for one ſooner.<note place="margin">Pag. 2.</note> of which he is the Judge. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi>
(as he goes on) <hi>abruptly to diſſolve Parliaments at ſuch
a time, when nothing but the Legiſlative Power, and the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56346:7"/>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Wiſdom of the Kingdom could relieve us from our juſt
fears, or ſecure us from our certain dangers, is very unſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the great Truſt repoſed in the Prince, and ſeems to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
but little of that affection which we will always hope his
Majeſty bears towards his People and the Proteſtant Religion.</hi>
That there was then too much need of the Legiſlative
Power and the Wiſdom of the Nation united in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
is not to be denied, and that his Majeſty was very
ſenſible of it appears, by his calling three Parliaments in
twenty ſix Months, as my Author computes it, <hi>page</hi> 46.
and we ſhall have occaſion hereafter to enquire by whoſe
fault it came to paſs that they were all ſo abruptly diſſolved,
and that will lead us to a probable conjecture why none
hath been ſince called; notwithſtanding his Majeſties Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to his People and the Proteſtant Religion is ſuch, that
we have great reaſon to bleſs God for it, and to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
it thankfully to him.</p>
            <p>My Author goes on thus:<note place="margin">Pag. 2.</note> 
               <hi>But it is not only of the Diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
it ſelf that we complain; the manner of doing it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warranted
by the precedents of former times, and full of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
Conſequents. We are taught by the Writ of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
that Parliaments are never called without the advice of
the Council, and the uſage of all Ages has been never to ſend
them away without the ſame advice. To forſake this ſafe
method is to expoſe the King perſonally to the reflections and
Cenſures of the whole Nation for ſo ungrateful an Action.</hi>
We may grant it the moſt uſual, and the beſt and ſafeſt
way to conſult the Council in both theſe Caſes. But yet
that will not preſently make the Act Arbitrary or Illegal, if
it be omitted, and in this Caſe if it were otherwiſe it may
poſſibly in the end appear to have been matter of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
rather than choice.<note place="margin">Colledges <hi>Trial,</hi> p. 37, 57, 73.</note> We may very well remember that
a great number of the Gentlemen of the Lower Houſe
went to <hi>Oxford</hi> with armed men to guard them from the
Papiſts, and ſome of them told the people at parting; <hi>They
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56346:7"/>
did never expect to ſee them again.</hi> The meaning of which
is poſſible to be underſtood. And beſides theſe there were
ſome other zealous men went; ſo that if his Majeſty did
not think it fit, or ſafe to conſult his Council, and ſpend
time in deliberating in the midſt of ſuch dangers, they muſt
bear the blame who gave the occaſion, and made it neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
So that theſe are the men, next ſuch as my Author,
who are to be charged, tho not with adviſing, yet with
neceſſitating the laſt diſſolution to be made, in the manner it
was,<note place="margin">Colledges <hi>Trial,</hi> p. 27, 30.</note> for the ſecurity of his Majeſties Life and Liberty,
which yet I would never have ſaid but to juſtifie his
Majeſty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But yet we muſt know all this Concern for the Council
is not out of kindneſs or reſpect to them,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 2.</note> 
               <hi>he ſaith,</hi> They are
puniſhable for ſuch Orders as are irregular; nor can the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
juſtifie any unlawful Action under colour of the Kings
Commands, ſince all his Commands that are contrary to law,
are void; (which is the true reaſon of that well known Maxim,
that the King can do no wrong) a Maxim juſt in it ſelf, and
alike ſafe for the Prince, and for the Subject; there being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more abſurd than that a Favourite ſhould excuſe his
enormous Actings by a pretended Command, which we may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably
ſuppoſe he firſt procured to be laid upon himſelf. But
we know not whom to charge with adviſing this laſt Diſſolution:
it was a work of darkneſs, and if we are not miſinformed, the
Privy Council was as much ſurprized at it as the Nation.
<hi>The ſorrow was; that in the next Parliament this great
Patriot would be at a loſs in his hunting for ſome body to
blame for an Action ſo ungrateful, as he repreſents it, to the
whole Nation; which in my judgment is a pretty way of
ſpending his Reflections and Cenſures on the King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And this is not all his vexation neither; for in the next
Paragraph he tells us,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 3.</note> Nor will a future Parliament be able
to charge any body as the Author or Adviſer of the late
Printed Paper, which bears the Title of his Majeſties
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56346:8"/>
Declaration, tho every good Subject ought to be careful how
he calls it ſo: for his Majeſty never ſpeaks to his People as a
King, but either perſonally in his Parliament, or at other
times under his Seal, for which the Chancellour or other Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
are reſponſible, if what paſſes them be not warranted by
Law. Nor can the direction of the Privy Council enforce any
thing upon the People unleſs that Royal and legal Stamp give
it an Authority: but this Declaration comes abroad without
any ſuch Sanction, and there is no other ground to aſcribe it
to his Majeſty than the uncertain credit of the Printer, whom
we will eaſily ſuſpect of an impoſture, rather than think the
King would deviate from the approved courſe of his Illuſtrious
Anceſtors, to purſue a new and unſucceſsful method.</p>
            <p>So here is all the Credit of the Declaration gone, and
the poor Printer left in the lurch to anſwer it to the next
Parliament for putting this impoſture on the Nation. But
what comfort is there in ſuch ſmall game? A Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour,
or other great Officer, is a Royal Game, and worth
the purſuit of a Houſe of Commons to pull him down;
but a pitiful Printer, who can find in his heart to imploy his
Oratory againſt ſuch mean Mechanicks? and as for the
Privy Council they can enforce nothing upon the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
without the Seal, ſo that for time to come all Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations,
and other publick Papers, may be ſecurely ſlighted
except they come Sealed with the great Seal, or ſome body
be ſent with them to aſſure us he ſaw it to the Original.
Thus far the Hiſtorian went, but then the Prophet comes
forth, and aſſures us, as this Method is <hi>new,</hi> ſo it will
be <hi>unſucceſsful.</hi> How truly the World is not now to be
told.</p>
            <p>From the Effect of the firſt Declaration of this kind,
which he ſaith was publiſhed in 1628. and filled the whole
Kingdom with Jealouſies, and was one of the firſt Cauſes of
the enſuing unhappy War;<note place="margin">Pag. 3.</note> he proceeds to tell us, <hi>That
Declarations to juſtifie what Princes do, muſt always be either
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56346:8"/>
needleſs or ineffectual: their Actions ought to be ſuch as may
recommend themſelves to the World, and carry their own
Evidence along with them of their uſefulneſs to the publick;
and then no Arts to juſtifie them will be neceſſary.</hi> Were all
Mankind wiſe and honeſt, this Argument would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerable,
but as long as ſome men out of Dulneſs, and
others out of Obſtinacy and Intereſt ſhut their Eyes to the
plaineſt and moſt evident demonſtrations of Reaſon, it
muſt of neceſſity be ſometimes neceſſary and fit for Princes
to Inform their Subjects of the reaſonableneſs of their
Actions; and accordingly the ſame courſe hath ever been
taken, and though it might fail of that end in 1628. yet it
hath often heretofore, and doubtleſs will often again ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
and the Jealouſies which then aroſe were not the
effect of the Declaration, but of thoſe ill Arts by which
ſuch a ſort of men as we have now to deal with, wheedled
the Populace into an ill opinion of the beſt of Princes
for Ends, that are now too well known to be again
imbraced.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>When a Prince deſcends ſo low as to give his Subjects Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
for what he has done,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 3.</note> 
               <hi>he not only makes them Judges whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there be any weight in thoſe reaſons, but by ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual
a ſubmiſſion gives cauſe to ſuſpect, that he is conſcious
to himſelf, that his Actions want an Apology.</hi> I never thought
before that the French Kings Logick was the only Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that became a Prince, <hi>Car tel eſt noſtre plaiſir,</hi> For ſo
our will and pleaſure is. And thoſe Subjects muſt be very
ill natured that grow jealous upon the Condeſcentions of
a Prince, and judge the Reaſons of a King to have the leſs
weight becauſe he graciouſly offers them to the Judgment
of his People; Sure I am ſometimes God Almighty is
pleaſed to do it, who only hath a right to command our
abſolute ſubmiſſion, upon the account of his infinite both
Wiſdom and Soveraignty. So that to ſuſpect the want of
of an Apology on no other grounds than a mans willingneſs
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56346:9"/>
to ſatisfie the World of the juſtice of a mans Cauſe, and
the reaſonableneſs of his Actions, is a perverſeneſs to
which common Knaves do ſeldom arrive; the Heroes of
Villany do not often riſe to that pitch of Brutality without
the help of <hi>Malmsbury</hi> Philoſophy. And I am perſuaded
that our Author would have ſpared this Cavil againſt his
Majeſties Declaration if he had before-hand conſidered
that in natural conſequence he charges not only the King,
but alſo the Three Eſtates with ſo many deliberate Acts of
folly and injuſtice as there are Acts of Parliament contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the reaſons of Enacting ſo or ſo.</p>
            <p>If a Princes Actions are indeed unjuſtifiable,<note place="margin">Pag. 3.</note> if they are
oppoſite to the Inclinations, and apparently deſtructive of the
Intereſts of his Subjects, it will be very difficult for the moſt
eloquent or inſinuating Declaration to make them in love with
ſuch things.</p>
            <p>And if they be none of all theſe, if a Crafty man may
but comment upon them, and by Ifs and Ands inſinuate
into the heads of the Common People that he takes them
for ſuch, it is poſſible all the Eloquence in the World may
not be powerful enough to bring them into their right wits
again, but yet this may fail too ſometimes.<note place="margin">Pag. 3.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore they did certainly undertake no eaſie task in
pretending to perſuade men who ſee themſelves expoſed to the
reſtleſs malice of their Enemies; who obſerve the languiſhing
condition of the Nation, and that nothing but a Parliament
can provide remedies for the great Evils which they feel and
fear; that two ſeveral Parliaments, upon whom they had
placed all their hopes, were ſo ſuddenly broken out of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to them, or with any regard to their advantage.</p>
            <p>No, I ſuppoſe no body was ſo ſilly as to undertake ſuch
an impoſſible task: but there was another ſort of men,
who had looked better into things, and care was to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of them to confirm them, and a third ſort that were
not yet well reſolved what to think of things, and they
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56346:9"/>
were to be directed and aſſiſted, and it was not impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
the Declaration might have a good effect upon them,
as indeed it had; as for thoſe that had placed all their
hopes upon the two laſt Parliaments, and were pleaſed
with all they did; there was neither hopes nor deſign of
working that Miracle upon them, but they were to be left
to time to be cured. And in the interim I would adviſe
them to ſtudy <hi>Colemans</hi> Declaration, of which my Author
ſaith fine things, which I care not to tranſcribe.</p>
            <p>But ſhould this Declaration be ſuffered to go abroad any
longer under the Royal Name;<note place="margin">Pag. 4.</note> yet it will never be thought
to have proceeded from his Majeſties Inclination or Judgment,
but to be gained from him by the Artifices of the ſame ill
men, who not being content to have prevailed with him to
diſſolve two Paliaments, only to protect them from Publick Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
do now hope to excuſe themſelves from being thought the
Authors of that Counſel by making him openly to avow it. But
they have diſcovered themſelves to the Kingdom, and have
told their Names when they number amongſt the great Crimes
of the Houſe of Commons, their having declared divers Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Perſons to be Ememies to the King and Kingdom.</p>
            <p>So his Majeſties Inclination and Judgment being kindly
abſolved from the guilt of this Declaration of purpoſe to
abate the Eſteem it ought to have. And ſeeing it is not
poſſible to keep it within doors, and that ſome may think
the worſe of it becauſe there was a ſham Declaration found
among <hi>Colemans</hi> Papers, as you know there was a ſham
Plot in the Meal-Tub, and yet there may be others that
are real. The next Inquiry, or rather Hue and Cry, is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Authors, and thoſe he thinks he hath found by the
paſſage he cites out of the Declaration, thoſe Eminent
Perſons, or ſome of them, muſt needs out of Revenge and
Fear be the Authors of this Peſtilent Declaration. His
Reaſon is this:<note place="margin">Pag. 4.</note> 
               <hi>None could be offended at the Proceedings of
the Parliaments but they who were obnoxious, none could be
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56346:10"/>
concerned to vindicate the Diſſolution but they who adviſed
it.</hi> But is my Author ſure of that, that never a man in
the Nation was offended at their proceedings but ſuch as
were obnoxious to them? I am of another mind, and ſo is
all the world now. Is it impoſſible for any man to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
to vindicate the Actions of a Prince but they that
adviſe him? What pitiful Sophiſtry this is. But were no men
obnoxious to the proceedings of theſe Parliaments but theſe
eminent men?<note place="margin">Declaration.</note> May not it be ſome of thoſe <hi>Subjects who were
by Arbitrary Orders taken into Cuſtody for matters that
had no relation to Priviledges of Parliament?</hi> They are
mentioned before the Eminent Perſons tho of a Meaner
degree. If I be not miſtaken, ſome Members too were
very diſgracefully Expelled the Houſe. Might not ſome of
them have a hand in it?<note place="margin">Pag. 5.</note> We are aſſured a little lower, that
the Writer was of another Nation from this Galliciſm, <hi>It
was a matter extremely ſenſible to us.</hi> So that this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
is ſuſpitious it is but a Tranſlation of a French Copy,
and the rather becauſe Monſieur <hi>Barillon,</hi> the French Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour,
read it to a Gentleman three days before it was
communicated to the Privy Council, if his intelligence did
not deceive him. So here is fair Scope left to find, or
ſuſpect at leaſt, other Authors beſides the Eminent Perſons,
other Adviſers beſides thoſe that were obnoxious. For I
ſuppoſe Monſieur <hi>Barillon</hi> doth not fear a Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.
And as for this and other Galliciſms that may
occur they are not to be wondred at in an Age that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
underſtands the French Tongue, in a Court where
almoſt all the Great men ſpeak it; in a Prince who hath
lived in <hi>France,</hi> and is deſcended of a French Mother.
And the wonder is not ſo prodigious neither that the
French Embaſſadour ſhould get a tranſcript of a Paper, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to be publiſhed to the whole Nation, two or three
days before it was read in Council. Theſe things make a
great noiſe to ignorant people, whilſt I am perſuaded this
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56346:10"/>
Gentleman ſmiled to think how finely he was deluding
them. But be theſe things as they will, the Eminent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
muſt expect to anſwer it.<note place="margin">Pag. 4.</note> 
               <hi>And our Author thinks they
cannot blame him or his Party for hoping one day to ſee
juſtice done upon ſuch Counſellours.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 5.</note> 
               <hi>And that the Commons
had reaſon for their Vote, when they declared thoſe Eminent
Perſons, who manage things at this rate, Enemies to the King
and Kingdom, and Promoters of the French Intereſt.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 6.</note>
            </p>
            <p>It is not ſtrange at all <hi>(that the Parliament at</hi> Oxford
<hi>ſhould anger the Court more than that at</hi> Weſtminſter) for
the Court did never yet diſſolve a Parliament abruptly, and
in heat, but they found the next Parliament more averſe,
and to inſiſt upon the ſame things with greater eagerneſs than
the former. Engliſh Spirits reſent no affronts ſo highly as thoſe
that are done to their Repreſentatives; and the Court will
be ſure to find the effects of that reſentment in the next
Election.</p>
            <p>The truth of this as matter of Hiſtory is very apparent,
for ſo it came to paſs in the Reign of his Majeſties Father,
upon every Diſſolution, the Commons made choice of the
ſame, or worſe, Members; till in 1640. they had fitted
themſelves with a Parliament to their hearts deſire, who
reſented, not the Affronts done to themſelves as the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
Repreſentatives, but the ſeveral Stops and Rubs that
had been laid in their way, ſo highly, that the Court,
<hi>i, e.</hi> the King, ſoon felt the effects of it. But did the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
eſcape? No, but Bloud and Violence, Anarchy and
Conſuſion took poſſeſſion of them to that height that

Miſery followed the 1640 Parliament, and
twenty years Peace the latter, which I cannot
but eſteem a more Loyal and a more Prudent reflection
than that he hath made; and much more neceſſary both
for the Repreſentatives and Electors. Let them however
now conſider ſeriouſly of it, and the next time ſend up
men zealous to bring the real Incendiaries of the Nation
to Juſtice, and then it is not to be doubted but ſome that
are Country Favourites, will be found to promote the
French and Popiſh Intereſt, as well as the Republick. And
I dare then become their Sponſor (if it might not look too

ſome ſpeedy determination in theſe matters, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by

with us to invert the Method we had propoſed to our

the matters in difference, untill ſuch a Synod may
be called, as may without prejudice or paſſion give
us ſuch further aſſiſtance towards a perfect union of
Affections, as well as ſubmiſſion to Authority, as is
neceſſary: And we are the rather induced to take this
upon us by finding upon the full Conferences we
have had with Learned men of ſeveral Perſuaſions,
that the miſchiefs, under which both Church and
State do at preſent ſuffer, do not reſult from any
formed Doctrine or Concluſion which either Party
maintains or avows, but from the Paſſion, and
Appetite, and Intereſt of particular perſons, who
contract greater prejudices to each other from thoſe
Affections, than would naturally riſe from their
Opinions; and thoſe diſtempers muſt be in
ſome degree allayed before the meeting in a Synod
can be attended with better ſucceſs than their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

They all approve Epiſcopacy; they all approve a

the ſin of Sacriledge, and the Alienation of the
Revenue of the Church; and if upon theſe excellent
foundations, in ſubmiſſion to which there is ſuch a
harmony of affections, any ſuperſtructures ſhould
be raiſed, to the ſhaking thoſe foundations, and to
the contracting and leſſening the bleſſed gift of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
which is a vital part of Religion; we ſhall
think Our Self very unfortunate, and even ſuſpect
that we are defective in that Adminiſtration of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment

and very ſolicitous, and even jealous that there is not
Expedition enough uſed in that Affair; and I thank you
for it, ſince I preſume it proceeds from a good root of
Piety and Devotion, but I muſt tell you, I have the
worſt luck in the world, if, after all the reproaches of
being a Papiſt, whilſt I was abroad, I am ſuſpected of
being a Presbyterian now I am come home: I know you
will not take it unkindly, if I tell you I am as zealous
for the Church of <hi>England</hi> as any of you can be, and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56346:14"/>
am enough acquainted with the Enemies of it, on all
ſides; that I am as much in love with the Book of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer,
as you can wiſh, and have prejudice enough
to thoſe who do not love it; who I hope in time will be
better informed, and change their minds; and you may be
confident, I do as much deſire to ſee a Uniformity ſettled
as any amongſt you. I pray truſt me in that Affair, I
promiſe you to haſten the diſpatch of it with all convenient

Gracious Declaration of your Majeſties Intentions to do
what in you lay, and what a Parliament ſhould adviſe
your Majeſty to do; And no ſuch adviſe was ever given,
or thought fit to be offered, nor could it be otherwiſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood,
becauſe there were Laws of Uniformity then
in being,<note place="margin">☞</note> which could not be diſpenſed with but by Act

that a right to the benefit of this Declaration doth ſtill

the ſame diligence, the ſame earneſt ſolicitations had been
made uſe of in that affair, which have ſince been exerciſed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
contrary to the deſign of it, there is no doubt but every
part of it would have had the deſired ſucceſs, and all his
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56346:16"/>
Majeſties Subjects would have enjoyed the fruits of it, and
have now been extolling a Prince ſo careful to keep ſacred his
Promiſes to his People.</p>
            <p>I ſay on the contrary, could his Majeſty have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
on by the unanſwerable reaſons of that moſt Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
and moſt Loyal Houſe of Commons, to have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced
the execution of the Laws againſt Diſſenters, he had
never ſeen his Affairs reduced to that ill condition they
were not long ſince in. And tho I queſtion not but by
Gods bleſſing his Majeſty will in a ſhort time reſettle things,
yet I will hope for time to come it ſhall be a Maxim in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
That the Strength of the Diſſenters is the Weakneſs of
the Throne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for our Authors jeering reflection on his Majeſties
other Declaration of <hi>April</hi> 20. 1679. concerning the Privy
Council, and ſome perſons then taken into it, his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
hath had but too much reaſon not to ſtick to the
ſame when he ſee there were ſome men whom nothing
could oblige to be faithful to him; but if his Majeſty hath
not adviſed with them; he hath with ſome others, at leaſt
as wiſe, and much honeſter than ſome of thoſe who were
laid aſide, ſo that that Declaration hath been effectually
made good to the Nation. And therefore we have no reaſon
to queſtion his Majeſties Candor in this.</p>
            <p>As for the Declaration read in our Churches the other day,<note place="margin">Pag. 7.</note>
there needs no other Argument to make us doubt of the reality
of the Promiſes which it makes, than to conſider how parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
and with how little ſincerity the things which it pretends
to relate are therein repreſented, it begins with telling us in
his Majeſties Name, <hi>That it was with exceeding great trouble
that he was brought to diſſolve the two laſt Parliaments
without more benefit to the People by the calling of them.</hi>
We ſhould queſtion his Majeſties Wiſdom, did we not believe
him to have underſtood that never Parliament had greater
Opportunites of doing good to Himſelf and his People. He
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56346:16"/>
could not but be ſenſible of the dangers, and of the
neceſſities of his Kingdom, and therefore could not without
exceeding great trouble be prevailed upon for the ſake of a
few deſperate men (whom he thought himſelf concerned to
love now, only becauſe he had loved them too well, and
truſted them too much before;) not only to diſappoint the
Hopes and Expectations of his own People, but of almoſt all
<hi>Europe.</hi> His Majeſty did indeed do his part, ſo far, in
giving opportunities of proving for our good, as the calling of
Parliaments do amount to, and it is to be imputed to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
only that the ſucceſs of them did not anſwer his and our
Expectations.</p>
            <p>Thus far my Author is recited verbatim, that it may
appear I do him no wrong. By which diſcourſe of his
(taking for the preſent no notice of his reflection on his
Majeſty for a perſon whoſe Promiſes were not real) it is
agreed that the two laſt Parliaments had great opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of doing good to his Majeſty and his People, and my
Author goes further, and adds the Hopes and Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of almoſt all <hi>Europe</hi> to them. That his Majeſty called
theſe Parliaments he owns. That one of them ſat a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
time for that purpoſe cannot be denied, <hi>viz.</hi> from
Thurſday <hi>October</hi> 21. 1680. till Monday the tenth day of
<hi>January</hi> following, which deducting the time ſpent in the
Trial of Viſcount <hi>Stafford,</hi> was in ſome mens opinions ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to have diſpatched much more buſineſs than was
then done. And yet it doth not appear that his Majeſty
was enclined to have prorogued them then if he had not
been highly provoked by them.</p>
            <p>What my Author means by thoſe few deſperate men that
prevailed upon his Majeſty ſo much againſt his Will to part
with that Parliament, I cannot gueſs, except they be the
Eminent Perſons which were declared Enemies to the King
and Kingdom: which if they were, they are neither ſo
few, nor ſuch deſperate men as to be laid aſide barely upon
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:56346:17"/>
a Vote of the Houſe of Commons, <hi>without any Order or
Proceſs of Law,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> 
               <hi>any hearing of their Defence, or any proof
ſo much as offered againſt them.</hi> And I believe the meaneſt
of them is equal to this Gentleman, as ſcornfully as he
ſpeaks of them.</p>
            <p>But then in the laſt place, whether or no the diſſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
be to be imputed to the Miniſters, or to the Parliament,
<hi>i. e.</hi> the Houſe of Commons will appear beſt in the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of his diſcourſe, and of the Declaration.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is certain</hi> (ſaith my Author) <hi>it cannot be imputed to
any of the proceedings of either of thoſe Parliaments;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 7.</note> 
               <hi>which
were compoſed of men of as good ſence and quality as any in the
Nation, and proceeded with as great moderation, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged
their debates with as much temper, as ever was known
in any Parliament.</hi> If all this is as certainly true as it is
confidently aſſerted, then is it but a folly to diſpute any
further about it. But becauſe his Majeſty in his Declaration
hath ſaid ſome things that ſeem to look another way, my
Reader may, if he pleaſe, ſuſpend his belief of this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
too; till his Majeſties Allegations and this Gentlemans
defence are examined, and then he will be better able to
paſs his Judgment.</p>
            <p>If they ſeemed to go too far in any thing, his Majeſties
Speeches or Declarations had miſled them, by ſome of which
they had been invited to enter into every one of thoſe debates
to which ſo much exception hath been ſince taken. Did he not
frequently recommend the proſecution of the Plot to them,
with a ſtrict and impartial inquiry? Did he not tell them, That
he neither thought himſelf nor them ſafe,<note place="margin">Speech. <hi>Octob.</hi> 21. 1680.</note> till that matter was
gone through with? <hi>Yes doubtleſs his Majeſty did all this;
but then where is any exception taken againſt any thing of
this Nature they have done?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Did he not in his Speech</hi> April 30,<note place="margin">Pag. 8.</note> 1679. <hi>aſſure them that
it was his conſtant care to ſecure our Religion for the future
in all events; and that in all things which concerned the

But,<note place="margin">Addreſs to the Freemen and Freehol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, <hi>Part</hi> II. <hi>pag.</hi> 22.</note> Sir, did not his Majeſty then alſo let you know that
he excepted one thing, in which he would neither lead, nor
follow their Zeal, which was the altering the deſcent of the
Crown in the right Line, or defeating the Succeſſion, which
his Majeſty commanded to be further explained by the
Lord Chancellour, in ſuch manner that it appeared to the
whole Nation that his Majeſty was reſolved to do any thing
for the freeing his People from their fears of Popery but
what might tend to the diſinheriting the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> or
any other Lawful Succeſſor?

an Act to that purpoſe?</hi> And did not that very Parliament
draw up a long Addreſs to his Majeſty, containing the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
why they could not concur with him in that point?
And is not this one good proof that his Majeſty was not
unmindful of his Declaration at <hi>Breda,</hi> but was kept from

And leaſt the malice of ill men,<note place="margin">Pag. 8.</note> (i. e. <hi>the Diſſenters)</hi> might
object, that theſe gracious inclinations of his continued no
longer than while there was a poſſibility of giving the Papiſts
equal benefit of a Toleration. Has not his Majeſty, ſince the
diſcovery of the Plot, ſince there was no hopes of getting ſo
much as a connivance for them in his Speech of <hi>March</hi> 6.
1678-9. expreſs'd his zeal not only for the Proteſtant Religion in
general, but for an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion amongſt all ſorts of Proteſtants. <hi>His
Majeſties words here are not truly recited, but are theſe:</hi>
I meet you here with the moſt earneſt deſire that man can have
to unite the minds of all my Subjects both to me and to one
another, and I reſolve it ſhall be your faults if the ſucceſs be
not ſuitable to my deſires, <hi>&amp;c. And a little after;</hi> Beſides that
end of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion which I aim at (and which I wiſh could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to Proteſtants abroad as well as at home) I propoſe by
this laſt great ſtep I have made <hi>(the ſending away his Royal
Highneſs the Duke of</hi> York) to diſcern whether Proteſtant
Religion and the peace of the Kingdom be as truly aimed at by
others as they are really intended by me, <hi>&amp;c. By which it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
the Union his Majeſty here meant was not that Union
that was afterwards ſet on foot in Parliament, and I
cannot but ſuſpect theſe words were miſrecited of
purpoſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And did not he comand my Lord Chancellour to tell them,<note place="margin">Pag. 8.</note>
That it was neceſſary to diſtinguiſh between Popiſh and other
Recuſants, between them that would deſtroy the whole flock,
and them that only wander from it. <hi>Theſe words are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
in the Lord Chancellors Speech but with this Preface,</hi>
Neither is there, nor hath been theſe fifteen hundred years, a
purer Church than ours,<note place="margin">Speech. <hi>Mar.</hi> 6 1678-9.</note> ſo 'tis for the ſake of this poor Church
alone that the State hath been ſo much diſturbed. It is her
Truth and Peace, her Decency and Order which they <hi>(the
Plotters and Papiſts)</hi> labour to undermine, and purſue with
ſo reſtleſs a malice; and ſince they do ſo, it will be neceſſary for
us to diſtinguiſh between Popiſh and other Recuſants, between
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:56346:18"/>
them that would deſtroy the whole Flock, and them that only
wander from it. <hi>So that whatever diſtinction his Majeſty
intended to allow between the Popiſh and Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſants,
it muſt be ſuch as was conſiſtent with the Truth,
Peace, Decency, and Order of the Religion by Law eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed,
which I ſuſpect the Project of Union ſet on foot
was not, much leſs the Vote of the tenth of</hi> January <hi>for
the ſuſpending the execution of all Penal Laws made
againſt them,</hi> as a weakening of the Proteſtant Intereſt,
an encouragement to Popery, and dangerous to the Peace of
the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theſe things conſidered,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 8.</note> 
               <hi>we ſhould not think the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
went too far, but rather that they did not follow his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
Zeal with an equal pace.</hi> At this rate of concluding
a man may draw any Concluſion from any premiſes if he
hath a mind to it. His Majeſty would joyn with them in
any courſe that might tend to the ſecurity of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Religion for the future,<note place="margin">Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors Speech, <hi>March</hi> 6. 167<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>ſo as the ſame extend not to
the diminution of his own Prerogative, nor to alter the deſcent
of the Crown in the right Line, nor to defeat the Succeſſion.</hi>
Therefore when they brought in a Bill to diſinherit his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
Brother againſt his expreſly declared reſolution, they
did not go too far, but rather they did not follow his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
Zeal with an equal pace. When his Majeſty thought
it neceſſary to diſtinguiſh betwixt Popiſh Recuſants, and
Proteſtant Diſſenters; that is, to favour the latter more
than the former, they were for taking away all thoſe Laws
at once that have diſtinguiſhed betwixt the Diſſenters and
the Religion eſtabliſhed, and giving up this Pure Church
into the hands of her bitter Enemies, that had but juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
bid fair for her ruine; as if the only care had been,
that the Papiſts might not have had the honour of deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her, and yet we are not to believe they went too far in
this neither.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:56346:19"/>
The truth is,<note place="margin">Pag. 9.</note> if we obſerve the daily provocations of the
Popiſh Faction, whoſe rage and inſolence were only increaſed
by the diſcovery of the Plot, (ſo that they ſeemed to defie
Parliaments, as well as inferiour Courts of Juſtice, under the
Protection of the Duke, their Publickly Avowed Head;) who
ſtill carried on their deſigns by new and more deteſtable me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
than ever, and were continually buſie by Perjuries and
Subornations, to charge the beſt and moſt conſiderable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
in the Kingdom with Treaſons as black as thoſe of
which themſelves were guilty. If we obſerve what vile Arts
were uſed to hinder the further diſcovery, what liberty was
given to reproach the Diſcoverers, what means uſed to deſtroy
or corrupt them; how the very Criminals were incouraged
and allowed to be good Witneſſes againſt their Accuſers: We
ſhould eaſily excuſe an Engliſh Parliament thus beſet, if they
had been carried to ſome little Exceſſes not juſtifiable by the
Laws of Parliament, or unbecoming the wiſdom and gravity
of an Engliſh Senate.</p>
            <p>Now other men may poſſibly be of another mind, and
think that if the ſtate of things had been but half ſo deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
as they are here deſcribed, the leaſt Exceſs had been
then inexcuſable, for there is never more need of gravity
than in great and eminent dangers; but what I ſhall ſay
will, it is like, not be much regarded, hear then what the
Chancellour of <hi>England</hi> ſaid:<note place="margin">Speech <hi>Mar.</hi> 6. 1678-9.</note> 
               <hi>The Conſiderations which are
now to be laid before you are as <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rgent and as Weighty as
were ever yet offered to any Parliament, or indeed ever can
be, ſo great and ſo ſurprizing have been our Dangers at home,
ſo formidable are the appearances of danger from abroad, that
the moſt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Counſels, the moſt Sedate and the calmeſt
Temper, together with the moſt dutiful and zealous affections
that a Parliament can ſhew, are all become abſolutely and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſably
neceſſary for our preſervation.</hi> So that little
exceſſes are great crimes; when men are beſet with
dangers tho they may be excuſed in times of Peace and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56346:19"/>
Security, if I rightly underſtand this wiſe and honourable
perſon.</p>
            <p>But if we come to ſearch into the particulars here enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated,
there may poſſibly ariſe better Arguments to
excuſe their Exceſſes. The Popiſh Faction about that time
having tried all other ways to clear themſelves of the Plot,
without any good ſucceſs, fell at laſt upon another Project,
which was to ſtart a New Plot. They knew there were in
<hi>London</hi> ſome Clubbs, and Coffee-houſe-Sets, of Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,
Old Army Officers, diſcontented Gentlemen, and
Republicans, which had cloſe Cabals, and private Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and that the Court had a jealous eye upon them, as
indeed there was good cauſe for it, and out of theſe mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials
they thought they might eaſily raiſe the ſtructure of a
Presbyterian Plot againſt the State, but all the chief men
of the Popiſh Faction being fled, impriſoned, or executed,
this grand Deſign fell into the hands of people of no great
either parts or reputation, to carry on ſo difficult an Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking,
and it was not likely neither to be eaſily believed
if it had no other Witneſſes but Papiſts to atteſt it. And
it was not poſſible for them to bring over any other, of
any reputation, in the low eſtate their affairs then were,
ſo that the Contrivance miſcarried, and only tended to
make the Papiſts more hated than they were before, and
this is called the Meal-Tub Plot; which I ſhould rather
have aſcribed to the rage and deſperation of the Papiſts, than
to their Inſolence, which was then very well abated by the
Execution of <hi>Coleman, Staley,</hi> the Murtherers of Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mundbury
Godfry,</hi> and the Jeſuits, which had reduced them
to too low a condition to defie the meaneſt Courts of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
in the Nation, and put them upon thoſe mean and
baſe thoughts of Perjuries and Subornations, to avoid that
ruine which they ſaw ready to overwhelm and deſtroy
them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:56346:20"/>
But that which they were never able to effect themſelves
the Diſſenters did for them, for from the moment the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
Plot was diſcovered they entered into a project to
make uſe of it another way againſt the King and Court
on one hand, and againſt the Church and the Loyal Gentry
on the other.</p>
            <p>In order to this they had theſe cloſe Cabals, and private
Meetings, (I laſt mentioned) where they invented and
ſpread abroad a thouſand idle Stories to fright the Common
People out of their little Wits; and alſo raiſed Money,
which they liberally beſtowed amongſt the Informers to
render them more obſequious to them, ſo that in a ſhort
time Informing became a very thriving trade, if it would
have held; and this great familiarity betwixt the diſcoverers
of the Plot and the Whigs was the beſt colour afterwards
for the Meal-Tub Presbyterian Plot.</p>
            <p>By this means the People were eaſily deluded into a
conceit that theſe Gentlemen who took ſuch care of the
Diſcoverers, and their Party, who were always haranguing
againſt Popery, were the only Proteſtants in the Nation
that could ſave them out of the hands of the Papiſts. And
on the other ſide, the Court and all the Loyal Gentry and
Clergy became ſuſpected of want of zeal againſt Popery;
and this was heightned by the Diſcoverers themſelves, who
were for the moſt part men of no very great or good qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
and were ſo puffed up by the flatteries and Libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
of the Whigs, and their own high conceits of the
Service they had done the Nation, that they thought no
recompence, no reſpect which was beſtowed upon them was
great enough, and ſo became inſolent both in their carriage
and diſcourſes, by which means they became leſs reſpected
rhan before, till at laſt they were forced to give themſelves
up intrirely to the Whigs.</p>
            <p>This had two very different effects upon ſeveral ſorts of
men, ſome believed that there was no Popiſh Plot, after
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:56346:20"/>
they ſaw the Diſſenters reap all the advantage by it. And
others thought that all but the Diſſenters were more or leſs
concerned in the guilt of it as well as the Papiſts, or at leaſt
were favourers of the Papiſts and Popery.</p>
            <p>Things being in this ſtate, eſpecially after the diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Long Loyal Parliament, the Diſcoverers loſt
much of their reputation, but that ever any vile Arts were
uſed to hinder any further diſcovery of the Plot by any but
the Papiſts, or that liberty was given to reproach, or any
means uſed to corrupt or deſtroy them that were the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
except it were by Papiſts, doth not appear, and in
all thoſe caſes, all the care in the world was taken of the
Witneſſes too, by the King and his Council. And as to that
which my Author mentions in the laſt place, How the very
Criminals were incouraged and allowed to be good Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
againſt their Accuſers, I cannot imagine what he
means by it; or when, or where it ſhould be done, tho
I have read over all the Printed Trials, and therefore it
is enough to deny this, and put him upon the proof
of it.</p>
            <p>But how did all theſe things tend to the advantage of the
Popiſh Plotters in the end?</p>
            <p>Firſt, As the Zeal of theſe people fired the Rabble, ſo it
put the Long Loyal Parliament too into ſo great a fret, that
it proved mortal; and then going downward, it put the
Country into ſuch diſorder, that tho his Majeſty hath given
us the opportunities of chuſing three Parliaments one after
another, we have not been able to ſend up one, that has
not fallen into thoſe <hi>little Exceſſes</hi> which have occaſioned
their diſſolution before they had done us any conſiderable
good. And at length his Majeſty is forced for ſome time
to keep us without one; to try if Faſting will bring us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our ſenſes again, and in the mean time the noiſe of the
Popiſh Plot is drowned, by new and more ſurprizing at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
of the Whigs, and that Popiſh Party, which whilſt
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:56346:21"/>
it had none but real Papiſts in its Liſt, was the abomination
of all Proteſtants, now the Whigs have joyned all the
Church of <hi>England</hi> men to them by their lies and ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
even that very Popiſh Party begin to be better
thought of for their ſakes who are falſly joyned with them,
and by theſe and many other ways the proſecution of the
Popiſh Plot any further is thought by moſt men impoſſible.
Whereas had not the Diſſenters been thus ſerviceable to
them, there is reaſon to believe they would have ſuffered
much more than they have done, and there would have
been much ſharper Laws made againſt them, than they
need fear now.</p>
            <p>If all this be conſidered, it will eaſily appear, it was not
the Protection of the Duke, whom this Gentleman can
never prove the Publickly avowed Head of the Papiſts, but
the over-doing of the buſineſs, that hath delivered the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
Faction out of that fear and danger which the diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the Plot had caſt them into.</p>
            <p>We muſt own <hi>(ſaith my Author)</hi> that his Majeſty has
opened all his Parliaments at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> with very Gracious
Expreſſions,<note place="margin">Pag. 9.</note> nor have we wanted that Evidence of his readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to ſatisfie the deſires of his Subjects, but that ſort of Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
will ſoon loſe its force if it be never followed by Actions
correſpondent; by which only the World can judge of the ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of Expreſſions or Intentions.</p>
            <p>Had the two ſhort Parliaments at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> been the
only Parliaments his Majeſty had ever called ſince his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
there might have been ſome colour for this undutiful
reflection, but all the World knows there were two there
before them, and that his Majeſty complied with them in
almoſt all they asked in a regular way, and when
at any time he was neceſſitated to deny them any requeſt, he
gave them ſuch reaſon for it, as they ſeemed to be well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
with his denial.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:56346:21"/>
It will appear to any man that his Majeſty hath paſſed
more Acts in twenty years than any one of his Anceſtors
have done in twice the time, that he hath abated more of
his juſt and real Prerogative than any Prince we ever yet
had could be brought to part with. The Court of Wards,
and the Right of Purveyance, were great advantages to
the Crown, and as troubleſom to the Subjects till his
Majeſty generouſly gave them up, and theſe two Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives
were never Conteſted, and I might inſtance in
ſome other if I did not think it ſit to be as ſhort as I
can.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In almoſt twenty years that the Long Loyal Parliament
ſate, I never heard of above one Bill that had paſſed both
Houſes, which was denied his Royal Aſſent, and that
was,</hi> The Bill for preſerving the peace of the Kingdom
by raiſing the Militia, and continuing them in duty for two
and forty days; which Bill was refuſed <hi>November</hi> 30. 1678.
and then alſo his Majeſty gave this reaſon for it: That he
did not refuſe to paſs it for the diſlike of the matter, but
the manner, becauſe it put the Militia for ſo many days out
of his power, and if it had been but for half an hour he
would not have conſented to it, becauſe of the ill conſequences
it might have hereafter, the Militia being wholly in the
Crown, <hi>&amp;c. Now I believe it would be difficult for my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
to make and prove the like inſtance, in any of our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Princes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And in the firſt of the ſhort</hi> Weſtminſter <hi>Parliaments his
Majeſty paſſed the Act for the better ſecuring of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of the Subject, and for preventing impriſonment
beyond Seas,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A ſeaſonable Addreſs to both Houſes of Parliament, pag. 4.</note> 
               <hi>to which an honourable Perſon adds,</hi> The
Act againſt quartering of Souldiers upon the Subject, and
ſaith, his Majeſty might have had many Millions for theſe
Acts if he had inſiſted on a bargain, or known how to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
between his own private Intereſt and that of the Subject,
or the truckling way of Bartering when the good of his People
was concerned.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:56346:22"/>
And in the laſt ſhort-lived <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Parliament his
Majeſty paſſed the Act againſt Importation of Iriſh Cattel,
for no other viſible cauſe, but becauſe both Houſes had
paſſed it, tho it tended to the Diminution of his Revenue.
And now let us ſee how gratefully our Author treats him for
all theſe Royal and Prince-like Favours.</p>
            <p>Therefore the Favorites did little conſult his Majeſties
Honour when they bring him in ſolemnly declaring to his
Subjects,<note place="margin">Pag. 9.</note> that his intentions were as far as would have conſiſted
with the very Being of the Government, to have complied with
any thing that could have been propoſed to him to accompliſh
thoſe Ends he had mentioned, which were the ſatisfying the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
of his Subjects, and ſecuring them againſt all their juſt
fears, when they are not able to produce an inſtance wherein
they ſuffered him to comply in any one thing. Whatever the
Houſe of Commons Addreſſed for, was certainly denied, tho
it was only for that reaſon; and there was no ſurer way of
Intituling ones ſelf to the favour of the Court, than to
receive a Cenſure from the repreſentative body of the
People.</p>
            <p>As to the Addreſſes made by the Houſe of Commons
alone, they were many of them ſuch as his Majeſty could
not comply with without great miſchief to himſelf or them
that had expreſt the greateſt Zeal for his Service, and
when for that caſe only they ſeemed to be perſecuted, it
would have been very impolitick in his Majeſty, tho he
had been his own man, and not under the dominion of the
Favorites (as it ſeems he was) to have yielded to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
againſt them.</p>
            <p>But cannot the Favorites inſtance wherein they ſuffered
his Majeſty to comply in any one thing with the Houſe of
Commons? Did not his Majeſty at their ſingle requeſt Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
a great many Informers againſt the Plotters? Did he
not pardon <hi>B. Harris</hi> too, his 500 <hi>l.</hi> Fine and Impriſonment
which he had incurred by Printing diſloyal and ſeditious
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:56346:22"/>
Pamphlets? Did not his Majeſty upon their Addreſs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
all the Proteſtant Diſſenters who were then under
proſecution upon ſeveral Penal Statutes, without paying
Fees, as far as it could be done according to Law, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
alſo to recommend them to the Judges? There might
many other inſtances be given, of moneys iſſued out, of
perſons taken care for, and the like upon the ſingle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
of the Commons, ſo that I cannot but wonder where
my Authors modeſty was when he preſſed the Favorites to
give one inſtance of his Majeſties compliance with the
Houſe of Commons.</p>
            <p>But his Majeſty and the Court were kind to all that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
any Cenſure from the repreſentative body of the
People. They might thank themſelves for that who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
their Cenſures ſo freely on men that had deſerved
very well of his Majeſty and the Government, and yet I
believe there may be ſome inſtances given of men whom
they Cenſured or impriſoned, that have not been mightily
advanced ſince by the Court, but let us examine thoſe
few particular Examples my Author hath marked out.</p>
            <p>Let it for the preſent be admitted <hi>(ſaith my Author)</hi>
that ſome of the things deſired by that Parliament were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant,<note place="margin">Pag. 10.</note>
and (becauſe we will put the objection as ſtrong as
is poſſible) inconſiſtent with the very being of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
yet at leaſt ſome of their Petitions were more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable.</p>
            <p>Doubtleſs there was ſome ſuch, which therefore were
freely granted by his Majeſty, as I have proved.</p>
            <p>The Government might have ſubſiſted though the Gentlemen
put out of the Commiſſion of the Peace for their zealous acting
againſt the Papiſts had been reſtored.<note place="margin">Pag. 10.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And ſo might the Proteſtant Religion by Law eſtabliſhed
be preſerved without the aſſiſtance of theſe zealous Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and therefore his Majeſty was not to be inſtructed by
theſe Repreſentatives, whom he ſhould imploy as Juſtices

of the Peace, eſpecially after they had diſcovered ſo much
kindneſs for the Diſſenters, who have ſomething an odd
Notion of Papiſts and Popery.</p>
            <p>Nor would a final Diſſolution of all things have enſued,<note place="margin">Pag. 10.</note>
tho Sir <hi>George Jefferies</hi> had been removed out of all Publick
Offices, or my Lord <hi>Hallifax</hi> himſelf from his Majeſties Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
and Councils.</p>
            <p>The firſt of theſe, Sir <hi>George Jefferies</hi> was then
Recorder of <hi>London,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Votes. <hi>Nov.</hi> 13. 1680.</note> and was proſecuted by a part of the
City, for that he by traducing and obſtructing Petitioning
for the ſitting of that Parliament, had betrayed the Rights
of the Subject. Now that Gentleman oppoſed them (as
many others did) in obedience to his Majeſties Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and the Laws of the Land; and it was a little unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
that his Majeſty ſhould joyn with the Commons to
ruine him, though it could be made out that his Majeſties
Proclamation was illegal, and that there were a miſtake alſo
in the point of Law.</p>
            <p>My Lord <hi>Hallifax</hi> was proſecuted only for oppoſing the
Bill for diſinheriting the Duke of <hi>York</hi> in the Houſe of Lords,
and no fault whatſoever laid to his charge. Now he being
a Member of that Houſe, it had been very unreaſonable
for his Majeſty to have puniſhed him for uſing his
own juſt and legal freedom, in a caſe eſpecially where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
his Majeſty had declared his own reſolution ſo very often
before.</p>
            <p>Now, Sir, tho theſe two Perſons are not eſſentially ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to the preſervation of the Government, yet it is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
ſo, that his Majeſty do not give up thoſe that have
faithfully and legally ſerved him in their proper Stations,
either to pleaſe the People or their Repreſentatives, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a legal trial, and a juſt defence. We may all remember
what the Conſequences of his Majeſties Fathers giving up
the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> in the beginning of the late troubles
were; and I hope I ſhall never live to ſee that ſort of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
reacted again.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:56346:24"/>
Had the Statute of 35.<note place="margin">Pag. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Eliz.</hi> (which had juſtly ſlept
for Eighty years, and of late, unreaſonably<note n="*" place="margin">16 Car. 2. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 4.</note> revived) been
repealed, ſurely the Government might ſtill have been ſafe.
And though the Fanaticks perhaps had not deſerved ſo well
as that in favour to them, his Majeſty ſhould have paſſed
that Bill, yet ſince the Repeal might hereafter be of great
uſe to thoſe of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in caſe of a Popiſh
Succeſſor, (which Bleſſing his Majeſty ſeems reſolved to
bequeath to his People) one would have thought he might
have complied with the Parliament in that Propoſal.</p>
            <p>It is very probable his Majeſty would have complied
with them in that particular, tho it is paſt a perhaps the
Fanaticks had not, nor ever will as long as they continue
ſuch, deſerve that favour at his hands: But, modeſt Sir,
how doth it appear that his Majeſty is reſolved to bequeath
his People the Bleſſing of a Popiſh Succeſſor? Hath he
promiſed the Duke to die before him? Hath his Majeſty
obliged him to continue a Papiſt (if he be one) in ſpight
of his Intereſt to the contrary? Is this your Juſtice? Is this
your Modeſty?</p>
            <p>But the Miniſters thought they had not ſufficiently trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phed
over the Parliament by getting the Bill rejected unleſs it
were done in ſuch a manner as that the precedent might be
more pernicious to Poſterity,<note place="margin">Pag. 10.</note> by introducing a new Negative in
the making of Laws, than the loſing the Bill, how uſeful ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
could be to the preſent Age.</p>
            <p>That this Bill was not tendered to his Majeſty for his
Aſſent appears by three Votes of the Commons at <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Houſe then according to their order (the day before)
took into conſideration the matter relating to the Bill which
paſſed both Houſes in tbe laſt Parliament,<note place="margin">Friday, March 25. 1681.</note> entituled, An Act
for the repeal of a Statute made in the 35 year of the Reign of
Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> but was not tendered to his Majeſty for his
Royal Aſſent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:56346:25"/>
Reſolved, that a Meſſage be ſent to the Lords, deſiring a
Conference with their Lordſhips in matters relating to the
conſtitution of Parliaments, in paſſing Bills.</p>
            <p>Ordered that a Committee be appointed to conſider of,
and prepare the ſubject matter to be offered at the ſaid
Conference.</p>
            <p>Thus far that Parliament went in order to the diſcovery
of the cauſe of the not tendering that Bill, and I have heard
the Lords alſo were upon an inquiry what was become of
it, but the diſſolution preventing them, I never heard that
there was any diſcovery made then or ſince of the perſon
or perſons that took it away.</p>
            <p>Now where my Author had his intelligence that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
took it away to introduce a new Negative in the
making of Laws, I ſhall not inquire.</p>
            <p>This we may affirm,<note place="margin">Pag. 10.</note> That if the ſucceſs of this Parliament
did not anſwer expectation, whoever was guilty of it, the
Houſe of Commons did not fail in doing their part. Never did
men husband their time to more advantage. They opened the
Eyes of the Nation, they ſhewed them their danger, with a
freedom becoming Engliſh men.</p>
            <p>It was a Caution given by Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> in the end
of a Parliament held in the 35th year of her Reign:<note place="margin">Hiſtorical Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect. of the four laſt Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Q. <hi>Eliz.</hi> p. 47.</note>

things which were ſaid to the Parliament at <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 11.</note>
His Majeſty ask'd of them the ſupporting the Alliances
he had made for the preſervation of the General Peace in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom.
It is to be wiſhed his Majeſty had added to his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
asking of Money a gracious Communication of thoſe
Alliances, that ſuch blind obedience had not been exacted from
them as to contribute to the ſupport of they knew not what
themſelves, nor before they had conſidered whether thoſe
Alliances which were made, were truly deſigned for that End
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56346:26"/>
which was Pretended <hi>(very dutifully ſaid)</hi> or any way likely
to prove effectual to it, ſince no precedent can be ſhewn, that
ever a Parliament (not even the late Long Parliament, tho
filled with <hi>Danby</hi> his Penſioners) did give money for maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any Leagues till they were firſt made acquainted with the
particulars of them.</p>
            <p>That Leagues have been communicated to Parliaments
heretofore is not to be diſputed, but that they were ever
tendered before they were asked for, is not ſo plain;
Nor doth it appear this was denied. And as to his
Parentheſis I deſire only that it may be obſerved
for my excuſe, in caſe I happen to ſpeak any thing
not reſpective enough of the renowned Parliament at
<hi>Weſtminſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But beſides this,<note place="margin">Pag. 11.</note> this Parliament had reaſon to conſider
well of the general Peace it ſelf, and the influence it might
have, and had, upon our Affairs, before they came to any reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
or ſo much as a debate about preſerving it; ſince ſo wiſe a
Miniſter as my Lord Chancellor <hi>(bleſſed be God
we have one wiſe Miniſter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lord Chancellors Speech.</hi> May 23. 1678. <hi>The words are theſe:</hi> The influence ſuch a Peace will have upon our Affairs are fitter for Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than Diſcourſe.—There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it will import us to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then our ſelves at home and abroad, that it may not be found a cheap or eaſie thing to put an Affront upon us.</note> 
               <hi>they have all along
hitherto in general terms been treated at ſuch
a rare as if none of them had had either Wit
or Honeſty)</hi> had ſo lately told us, that it was
fitter for meditation than diſcourſe. He informed
us in the ſame Speech, that the Peace then was
but the effect of Deſpair in the Confederates,
and we have ſince learnt by whoſe means they
were reduced to that Deſpair, and what price was demanded of
the French King for ſo great a Service.</p>
            <p>It is an old Maxim, That men ſhould neither deliberate
nor debate about thoſe things that are not in their power.
Now, whatever this General Peace was, and whatever
the effects of it might be, the right of Peace and War was
in the King, and the Commons could not alter one tittle of
it: And a ſmall degree of experience in the World will
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56346:26"/>
tell any man, that <hi>England</hi> was not then in a condition to
break alone with that Monarch, which had tired out all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom
with a tedious expenſive War, when they were
united againſt him: And therefore the beſt Expedient that
could then have fallen into the Heads of the Commons had
been to have ſhewn him, and all the Confederates, that
we were reſolved to have ſtood by our King with our Lives
and Fortunes, which would have heartned them on
to a ſtout reſiſtance in caſe of his further encroachments
upon them, and in likelihood have kept him in ſome aw;
whereas the courſe that was taken had a quite contrary
effect, and tended more a thouſand times to the diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
of the Confederates than the fruitleſs attempt he
hints at, made by the Earl of <hi>Danby,</hi> who was then in the
Tower for it. So that I believe all <hi>Europe</hi> will bear me Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
that all the great things the French King hath ſince
done were in a great meaſure owing to the<note n="*" place="margin">Dr. <hi>Nalſon</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, that the like diſorders had the ſame effect in the time of His Majeſties Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who (he ſaith by this means) loſt the opportunity of being able to ſupport his Friends and Allies, as alſo that Honour and Terrour among his Enemies Abroad, which the Union and hearty Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his Parliament, would have rendred great and dreadful, but now he became mean and contemptible; that Prince who hath not power o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

               <hi>Amongſt the great things the French King hath done
ſince the Peace,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 11.</note> 
               <hi>my Author tells us this:</hi> His Penſioners at
our Court have grown inſolent upon it, and preſumed that now
He <hi>(the French King)</hi> may be at leiſure to aſſiſt them <hi>(the
Penſioners)</hi> in ruining <hi>England,</hi> and the Proteſtant Religion
together. (And they) have ſhaken off all dread of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and have prevailed with his Majeſty to uſe them with
as little reſpect, and to diſperſe them with as great contempt,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:56346:27"/>
as if they had been a Conventicle, and not the great Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative
of the Nation, whoſe Power and Wiſdom only could
ſave him and us in our preſent Exigencies.</p>
            <p>Surely the man that talks thus contemptuouſly of his
Majeſty and all the Miniſters, durſt have told us, if he could,
who were theſe French Pentioners, but it was not his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
to point out the men; but to caſt out general Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations
againſt the King, the Miniſters, and the whole Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
thereby to incenſe the People, and to make them
ungovernable, that ſo his Majeſty might be the ſooner
neceſſitated to ſubmit himſelf to that <hi>Power and Wiſdom
that could only ſave him and us,</hi> but might alſo eaſily ruine
both, if things were once put into ſuch a ſtate, as his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
were no longer Maſter of that Power.</p>
            <p>As to the Accuſation, or rather Calumny, that the
Engliſh Miniſters are Penſioners to the French King, it
will eaſily appear falſe to any man that doth but reflect on
<hi>Colemans</hi> Letters, in 1674: when the King was in a much
better condition to oppoſe and ruine the French deſigns and
enterprizes, and the French King had all the Confederates
United, and in an Actual War with him, and there was
nothing to fear or hope for but in <hi>England,</hi> yet he then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
three hundred thouſand Pounds, tho it was pretended
it would have aſſured the Diſſolution of that long Loyal
Parliament, which <hi>France</hi> feared more than threeſcore ſuch
as have followed it; and when at laſt <hi>Coleman</hi> deſcended

                  <hi>Colemans</hi> long Letter.</note> 
               <hi>He was denied it, Monſieur</hi> Rouvigni, <hi>the French
Embaſſadour, uſually telling him, That if he could be ſure of
ſucceeding in that deſign his Maſter would give a much larger
Sum; but that he was not in a condition to throw away money
upon uncertainties,</hi> Nor doth it appear that ever <hi>Coleman</hi> got
one farthing at that time.</p>
            <p>And after the diſcovery of the Plot, and the diſſolution
of the long Loyal Parliament, the general Peace having
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:56346:27"/>
delivered the French King from all Apprehenſions of good
or hurt from <hi>England;</hi> His Majeſty having ſuch ill ſucceſs in
the firſt ſhort <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Parliament, and the Diviſions of
<hi>England</hi> appearing more fully in the Election of the Second,
and the year that paſſed betwixt that and its ſitting, (all
which were as well known in <hi>Paris</hi> as in <hi>London)</hi> it is not
to be doubted but he very well underſtood that there was
then leſs reaſon to maintain Penſioners in <hi>England</hi> than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
So that we may conclude from that time there hath
come but little French Money over into <hi>England</hi> for Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
to any Party, <hi>England</hi> being thought in <hi>France</hi> ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable
by reaſon of her Domeſtick Feuds, Fears, and
incurable Jealouſies; that there is nothing to be feared or
hoped from it; whereas Penſions are to be imployed in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
and United States.</p>
            <p>I do not deſign by this to prove that no French Penſioners
are now maintained in <hi>England,</hi> but that they are few, and
gain but little by it, and therefore it is ridiculous to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that all our Miniſters of State are ſuch, and that they
ſhould be ſuch fools as to conſpire with <hi>France</hi> to ruine
<hi>England</hi> for nothing, or that which is next to it. And it is
as ſilly a ſuppoſition that the Privy Council, and the reſt of
the Miniſters of State, who are not Penſioners, ſhould
not diſcover thoſe that are, as ſoon as this diſcontented
Gentleman.</p>
            <p>There is a lewd and impoſſible conceit ſpread under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
about the Nation that the King himſelf is a Penſioner
to <hi>France:</hi> and all that is pretended to juſtifie it, is only
his being able to ſubſiſt ſo long without Parliamentary Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies.
Now, this I believe is not credited by any men of
underſtanding, but yet there are many ſuch, who for ill
ends ſpeak it in ſome companies, and will ſhake their heads,
and ſhrug their ſhoulders, and look gravely in other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies,
that they may ſeem to fear what they durſt not
ſpeak.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:56346:28"/>
Now, if what I have ſaid before be applied to this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
it will appear more ridiculous; for that Penſion
that may tempt a hungry Courtier, who is to raiſe a Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
would be rejected with ſcorn if it were tendered to a
meaner Prince than ours is. And it is not to be thought
that the French King, who is obſerved to be as ſparing of
his Wealth, as prodigal of his Souldiers, would ever be
at ſuch an Expence as to maintain our Court and his own;
for fear the King ſhould unite with a Parliament that would
be an Enemy to <hi>France;</hi> no, all knowing men underſtand
how little he cares for <hi>England</hi> if it were quiet at home,
but as now things ſtand he ſcorns it, as beneath his Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</p>
            <p>Well, but if neither the Miniſters, nor his Majeſty are
to be ſuſpected, who are? I will tell you that in the words
of a more knowing man than I dare pretend to be.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that roar moſt againſt French Councils and Meaſures;<note place="margin">A ſeaſonable Addreſs to the Parliament.</note>
               <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder-hand-bargains, and Agreements, between both the
Kings,<note place="margin">pag. 6, 7.</note> know they belye their own Conſciences, and that the
French have us in the laſt degree of Contempt. This the
Earl of <hi>Danby</hi> Printed in his own vindication, perhaps not
ignorant that ſome of their Miniſters did in the year 1677,
and 78. before the breaking forth of the Plot, declare, That
Monſieur <hi>L.</hi> had greater intereſt, and more Friends in <hi>England</hi>
than the Duke of <hi>York;</hi> that the King had need be on his
guard, for he was in great danger of running the ſame riſque
with his Father, when it was likewiſe inquired what intereſt
amongſt the People two great Peers had, who have ſince
the Plot been great Pillars of the Proteſtant Religion, tho
neither was ever reputed to have any, were Miniſters and Ad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>viſers
in 1670, and 71. very good Friends to <hi>France</hi> and
Popery, Enemies to the Triple Alliance, and to <hi>Holland,</hi> &amp;c.
It was alſo ſaid, That 300000 l. a year beſtowed in <hi>Scotland</hi>
and <hi>England,</hi> among the Factious and Diſcontented, would bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſerve the Intereſt of <hi>France,</hi> than any Bargain they could
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:56346:28"/>
drive with the Miniſters. <hi>Thus far that noble Pen hath
diſcovered who are the French Penſioners, and Reaſon
ſpeaks the ſame thing: For if it be the Intereſt of</hi> France <hi>to
divide</hi> England, <hi>it is their Intereſt too, to do it as cheap as
they can, and there is no doubt to be made of it but</hi>
10000 l. <hi>a year, divided amongſt the</hi> London <hi>Holders<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth,
and the</hi> Walling fordians, <hi>on no other condition but
that they ſhould declaim ſtoutly againſt the King, the
Court, the Miniſters,</hi> France, <hi>and Popery, (things which
no money could make them forbear ſpeaking againſt)
would more effectually engage them to go on in that courſe,
than all the treaſures of</hi> France <hi>would the King and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
to procure the Ruine of</hi> England, <hi>and the ſettlement
of Popery; things which Nature and Education have
taught them to abhor. And by this means</hi> England <hi>(as
they might eaſily foreſee) would be ſo divided, that if a
Civil War did not follow, yet at leaſt there would be no
fear of its being in a condition to look abroad and ſuccour
its Neighbours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To theſe men is owing all that Contempt that hath fallen
upon our Engliſh Parliaments both at home and beyond
the Seas, who by putting the Houſe of Commons upon
thoſe things that would diſguſt the King, and all the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
in the Nation, have done as much as they could to make
them firſt feared, and then hated by almoſt one half of the
Subjects, and tends as directly to the ruine of that ancient
and excellent Conſtitution as the diſorders of the Tribunes
of the People, did to the ruine of the Liberty of the
<hi>Romans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But alas if we look into the Speech made at the opening of
the Parliament,<note place="margin">Pag. 12.</note> we ſhall find no mention of any new Ally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the Spaniard, whoſe Affairs at that time, through the
defects of their own Government, and the Treachery of our
Miniſters, were reduced to ſo deſperate a ſtate, that he might
well be a burthen to us, but there was little to be hoped from
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:56346:29"/>
a Friendſhip with him; unleſs by the name of a League to
recommend our Miniſters to a New Parliament, and cozen
Country Gentlemen of their Money.</p>
            <p>Before I can anſwer this, I ought to Tranſcribe ſo much
of his Majeſties Speech as concerns this buſineſs; which is
as followeth:</p>
            <q>
               <floatingText xml:lang="unk">
                  <body>
                     <div type="speech">
                        <opener>
                           <salute>My Lords and Gentlemen,</salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p>The ſeveral Prorogations I have made, have been
very advantageous to our Neighbours, and very uſeful
to me; for I have employed that time in making and
perfecting an Alliance with the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to that which I had before with the States of the
United Provinces, and they alſo had with <hi>Spain,</hi> conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of mutual obligations of Succour and Defence.</p>
                        <p>I have all the reaſon in the world to believe, that
what was ſo much deſired by former Parliaments, muſt
needs be very grateful to you now: For tho ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
may wiſh theſe Meaſures had been taken ſooner, yet
no man can with reaſon think it is now too late; for they
who deſire to make theſe Alliances, and they who deſire to
break them, ſhew themſelves of another opinion.</p>
                        <p>And as theſe are the beſt Meaſures that could be taken
for the ſafety of <hi>England,</hi> and repoſe of Chriſtendom,
ſo they cannot fail to attain their End, and to ſpread
and improve themſelves further, if our Diviſions at
home do not render our Friendſhip leſs conſiderable
abroad.</p>
                     </div>
                  </body>
               </floatingText>
            </q>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:56346:29"/>
Now all the Gentlemans Craft lay in the word <hi>New,</hi>
there is no mention of any <hi>New Ally.</hi> No, but there is
mention of an old one, double Confederated both with
<hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>England</hi> to the ſame purpoſe, and theſe three
States being thus United, as his Majeſty truly tells them,
would in a little time draw in more if our Diviſions did not
prevent it. Our Diviſions had that effect, and made the
King a true Prophet againſt his will, and now all the blame
is to be thrown upon the Miniſters, that is in reality upon
the King.</p>
            <p>Nay, our Miniſters (poor unfortunate men) muſt bear
the reproach of Ruining not only <hi>England,</hi> but <hi>Spain</hi> too
by their Treachery: but yet our kind Author doth not
lay all that burthen upon their ſhoulders, but confeſſeth
that their ill Governing had a part in it; but however it
came to paſs, <hi>Spain</hi> was in ſo deſperate a ſtate then that it
might be a burthen to <hi>England,</hi> but no ways beneficial.
And yet before the end of this very Paragraph he is in a
dreadful fear that <hi>Spain</hi> ſhould joyn with his Majeſties
Succeſſor, and for the introduction of Popery make a War
upon the People with all his Forces by Sea and Land. At
this rambling rate does our Gentleman talk.</p>
            <p>It cannot be denied but that the Affairs of <hi>Spain</hi> were
very ill managed at that time, but then that was owing to
the Minority of their King, the Factions in their Court,
the Conteſts betwixt <hi>Don John</hi> and the Queen-Mother
their Regent, and their two Parties, and it is not improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
the French King might have ſome few Penſioners in
<hi>Spain</hi> as well as <hi>England;</hi> but yet that once moſt potent
Kingdom was not ſunk to ſo low an Ebb of Fortune as to
be only a burthen to its Allies, tho it had need of them,
and ought by all the rules of Policy to have been ſo much
the more carefully ſecured and ſupported by them, eſpecially
by <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:56346:30"/>
And therefore our Country Gentlemen, who were too
wiſe to be cozened of their money by the crafty Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
will, I hope, not lay it to their charge too, that the
Affairs of <hi>Spain</hi> have ever ſince viſibly declined, and the
French King hath taken near as much from his Neighbours
during the Peace, upon pretence of Dependencies by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
as he got in all the War by his Sword and potent Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
For this ſeems in great part at leaſt, not ſo much
owing to the <hi>Treachery of our Miniſters,</hi> as to the Tenacity
and thriftineſs of theſe <hi>Country Gentlemen, that were ſo ſhie of
being cozened of their Money.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But upon the peruſal of the League,<note place="margin">Pag. 12.</note> it appears by the
3, 4, and 5. Articles, that it was like to create us troubles
enough, for it engages us indefinitely to enter into all the
quarrels of the Spaniards, tho they hapned in the <hi>Weſt Indies</hi>
or the <hi>Philippine</hi> Iſlands, or were drawn upon himſelf by his
own injuſtice or cauſeleſs provocations.</p>
            <p>Whether my Author have been any more faithful in his
account of this League, than he was of the Kings Speech
I cannot ſay; becauſe it is not in my power to examine
thoſe Articles. But his mentioning our obligation to aſſiſt
<hi>Spain</hi> in the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> and <hi>Philippine</hi> Iſlands, where it is
impoſſible, againſt the Duke of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> and the King
of <hi>Portugal,</hi> where it would be unjuſt, and againſt his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Subjects oppreſt by him, as they were by his
Grandfather <hi>Philip,</hi> are ſuch things would make a man
ſuſpect his ſincerity a little; and the rather, becauſe his
Majeſty tells us, <hi>The League was ſuitable to that which he
had before with the States of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces, and they
alſo had with</hi> Spain, <hi>conſiſting of mutual obligations of Succour
and Defence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, the account my Author gives of it is in part ſo
impoſſible, and in the reſt ſo improbable, that no Mortal in
his right Wits can believe that <hi>Spain</hi> ſhould deſire, or
<hi>England</hi> grant, any ſuch things. And therefore if he had
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:56346:30"/>
at all expected to have been believed, he ought to have
Tranſcribed thoſe three Articles for a proof of what he
had ſaid.<note place="margin">Verbae ſtrictius quam fere proprietas, ſumenda erunt, ſi id neceſſarium erit ad vitandam iniquitatem, vel Abſurdltatem, atſi non talis eſt neceſſitas, ſed manifeſta aequitas vel utilitas in reſtrictione, ſubſiſtendum erit intra arctiſſimos terminos pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietatus niſi Circumſtantia ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ud ſuadeant. <hi>Grot. de jure Belli &amp; Pacis, lib. 2. cap. 16. ſect.</hi> 12.</note> And whereas he tells us, it engages
us indefinitely to enter into all the quarrels of
the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> That, if true, will bear a fair
Conſtruction, and will no more oblige us to
thoſe things he mentions (if they be not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd,
(nay, I think I may ſay, if they be)
in plain terms) than it will to help the King
of <hi>Spain</hi> to deſtroy our ſelves, in caſe he ſhould
happen to have a quarrel with us hereafter.
For no League can bind any further than as it is
juſt and poſſible.</p>
            <p>But that which concerns us yet nearer <hi>(ſaith my Author)</hi>
in this League,<note place="margin">Pag. 13.</note> is, that this obligation of Aſſiſtance was mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
ſo that if a Diſturbance ſhould happen hereafter in
<hi>England</hi> upon any attempt to change our Religion, or our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
tho it was in the time of his Majeſties Succeſſors.
The moſt Catholick King is obliged by this League, (which we
are ſtill to believe was entered into, for the ſecurity of the
Proteſtant Religion, and the good of the Nation) to give aid
to ſo pious a deſign, and to make War upon <hi>(their Majeſties)</hi>
the <hi>People</hi> with all his Forces both by Land and Sea. And
therefore it was no wonder that the Miniſters were not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in ſhewing this League to the Parliament, who would
have ſoon obſerved all theſe inconveniences, and have ſeen
how little ſuch a League could contribute to the preſerving the
General Peace, or to the ſecuring of <hi>Flanders,</hi> ſince the
French King may within one months time poſſeſs himſelf of it,
and we by our League are not obliged to ſend our Succours
till three months after the Invaſion, ſo that they would upon
the whole matter have been inclined to ſuſpect, that the main
end of this League was only to ſerve for a handſom pretence
to raiſe an Army in <hi>England,</hi> and if the <hi>People</hi> here ſhould
grow diſcontented at it, and any little diſorders ſhould enſue;
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:56346:31"/>
The Spaniard is thereby obliged to ſend over Forces to ſuppreſs
them.</p>
            <p>This is fraught with ſuch rare new Politicks, and he has
taken ſuch care to make Rebellion ſafe, whether it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
in his Majeſties time, or in his Succeſſors, eſpecially
if it were in order to the preſervation of our Religion
and Government, (and wo be to the man that begins one
on any other pretence) that I thought ſit to tranſcribe it
intire.</p>
            <p>But Sir, whatever the Spaniard hath promiſed, or the
Miniſters intended againſt the <hi>People</hi> muſt needs come to
nothing; for you know that his Affairs were lately, <hi>through
the defects of his own Government, and the Treachery of our
Miniſters, reduced to ſo deſperate a ſtate, that he might well
be a Burthen to us, but there was little to be hoped for from
a friendſhip with him;</hi> and therefore as little in haſt to be
feared from his Forces too, if he ſhould be ſo Popiſhly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
as to think it a Pious deſign to help the King to
bring in Arbitrary Government, by the handſom pretence
of an Army raiſed for his aſſiſtance: or that and Popery
too in the time of his Majeſties Succeſſor, to which this
Gentleman knows (no man better) the <hi>People</hi> have no
Maw, tho the Miniſters have a filthy inclination, and
therefore cunningly took care by their Treachery to reduce
his Affairs (whoſe help they chiefly relied on) into that
deſperate condition we lately ſee them in.</p>
            <p>Well, but for all that he may recover ſome part of his
ancient Power; yes, who doubts that, to hurt us, but not
to help us. And now, no man can blame the Miniſters
that they were not forward in ſhewing this League to the
Parliament, who would doubtleſs have forthwith Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed
to the King againſt them, and uſhered it in with a
Vote, <hi>that they were all of them Promoters of Popery, and Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
Counſels, and Enemies to the King and Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:56346:31"/>
By this League in ſeems the King was not obliged to
ſend over any Succours till three months after an Invaſion,
(tho it is as plain as the Noſe on a mans face) that the
French King may in one months time poſſeſs himſelf of
<hi>Flanders.</hi> He may however take longer time, if he pleaſe,
for any care was taken here to prevent it, ſo that if his
Majeſty had taken a little too long a time to ſend in his
Aids (which all things conſidered few men will think
he did) yet they that ſhould have backed him in it have
taken a longer time, and therefore ought not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain.</p>
            <p>The next thing <hi>(ſaith my Author)</hi> recommended to them
was the further Examination of the Plot,<note place="margin">Pag. 13.</note> and every one who
have obſerved what has paſſed for more than two years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
cannot doubt but that this was ſincerely deſired by ſuch
as are moſt in credit with his Majeſty. And then ſurely the
Parliament deſerved not to be cenſured upon this account,
ſince the Examination of ſo many new Witneſſes, the Trial of
the Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> the great preparations for the trial of
the reſt of the Lords, and their diligent inquiry into
the Horrid Iriſh Treaſons, ſhew that the Parliament
wanted no diligence to purſue his Majeſties good intentions in
that affair.</p>
            <p>Now Sir, If they had but ſuſpended the Bill for diſinhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riting
the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and their Votes that followed
upon the throwing it out in the Lords Houſe, and could
but have held their hands from ſending for their fellow-Subjects
into Cuſtody, till they had diſpatched this great
Affair, &amp; tried all the other Lords in the Tower; it is thought
by wiſer men than I, they might have had time enough to
have gone through with this buſineſs, but ſome body tells
us the <hi>Plot was to be kept on foot,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Seaſonable Addreſs, p 3.</note> 
               <hi>elſe they would be defeated.</hi>
It was to be uſed like the Holy War, always a doing, never
done withal, till it made way for ſome other deſigns that
would not go merrily without the noiſe of a Plot to drive

            <p>

When his Majeſty deſired from the Parliament their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
and aſſiſtance concerning the Preſervation of <hi>Tangier,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 13.</note>
the Commons did not neglect to give it its due Conſideration,
as appears by their Addreſſes of <hi>November</hi> 29. and <hi>Decemb.</hi>
21. 1680. and they told him, no better could be expected of a
Town for the moſt part under Popiſh Governours; and always
filled with a Popiſh Garriſon.</p>
            <p>Now this Gentleman might have done the World a
Kindneſs to have told us how the Popery of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
or Garriſon contributed any thing to the preſent Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies
of that place, into which it fell, not by any neglect
or Treachery, but by a Siege laid about it by a potent Army
of Moors.</p>
            <p>They promiſed to aſſiſt him in defence of it,<note place="margin">Pag. 13.</note> as ſoon as ever
they could be reaſonably ſecured, that any Supply which
they gave for that purpoſe, ſhould not be uſed to augment the
ſtrength of our Popiſh Adverſaries, and to encreaſe our dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
at home.</p>
            <p>All the reſt is of the ſame kind with this. But Sir, can
you tell what was meant by a <hi>reaſonable ſecurity?</hi> Or
wherein the ſtate of <hi>England</hi> would have been mended if
<hi>Tangier</hi> had been loſt? Or can you give us any reaſon why
this Parliament ſeemed reſolved to run the Riſque of loſing
this Town,<note place="margin">April 7, and 9. 1678.</note> when the former Parliament had Voted ſo
ſtoutly for the Annexing it to the Crown? I might perhaps
go near to anſwer all theſe queſtions from the exact
Collection of Debates which are Printed, but the ſafer
and ſhorter way is to refer my Reader to them for his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.</p>
            <p>My Author owns that his Majeſty offered to concur in any
Remedies that could be propoſed for the ſecurity of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Religion,<note place="margin">Pag. 14.</note> but (ſaith he) he was pleaſed to go no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>(how could he?)</hi> for thoſe Remedies the Commons
offered were rejected, and thoſe which they were preparing
were prevented by a diſſolution.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:56346:32"/>
What was rejected is well enough underſtood, <hi>viz.</hi> the
Bill of Excluſion, and if the Aſſociation was what was
preparing, it is not great wonder it ſhould be prevented by
a Diſſolution. But for this we muſt be contented to remain
in ignorance.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty had complained of Addreſſes in the name
of Remonſtrances rather than Anſwers.<note place="margin">Pag. 14.</note> Now, here my

expreſſing the reaſons of their reſolution. Now, if this be
the meaning of the Word, we muſt own his Majeſty hath
in this particular charged the Commons wrongfully, for
there was ſeldom too much modeſty joyned with their
Reaſons, but they rather to us poor Country Folk, ſeemed
to have altogether loſt that reſpect that was due to the
Crown, as any body elſe would think that ſhould compare
their Addreſſes with thoſe made in the Reign of Queen
<hi>Elizabeth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hiſt. Col. of the four laſt Parliaments of <hi>Q Eliz.</hi>
               </note> particularly that made to thank her for taking
away a part only of the Monopolies that oppreſſed them
in the 44. year of her Reign, when the Speaker and the

rate, and not much unlike thoſe who remonſtrated to his
Majeſties Father till they at laſt fairly brought him to the

               <hi>My Author conſiders in the next place that part of the
Declaration which concerns the Arbitrary Orders for ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
perſons into cuſtody,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 15.</note> 
               <hi>for matters that had no relation
to Priviledges of Parliament,</hi> &amp;c. If <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> they
<hi>(the Miniſters)</hi> intended by theſe general words to reflect
on the Orders made to take thoſe degenerate Wretches into
Cuſtody who publiſhed under their hands Abhorrences of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,
and of thoſe who in humble and lawful manner pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioned
for their ſitting, in a time of ſuch extreme neceſſity.
Surely they are not in good earneſt; they cannot believe
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:56346:33"/>
themſelves, when they ſay, that theſe matters have no relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to Priviledges of Parliament, if the Priviledge of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
be concerned when an injury is done to any particular
Member, how much more when men ſtrike at Parliaments them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and endeavour to wound the Conſtitution?</p>
            <p>But, Sir, I hope it is no breach of Priviledge of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
now to beg a ſmall favour at your Worſhips hands,
and that is to produce but one inſtance of one ſingle man
that ever publiſhed an Abhorrence of Parliaments in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
or of that Parliament in particular before it ſate. It
ſeems mighty probable to me, that theſe Wretches were a
part of them, and the rather, becauſe my Author is fain
to miſrepreſent the whole matter of Fact to make it ſeem
juſt. Now, Sir, all the queſtion was, whether the manner
of Petitioning, then taken up by the Rabble, was lawful
or humble? You ſay it was both, but, Sir, your Sentence
is neither Concluding, nor yet infallible; and therefore we
appeal from it to the next Loyal Parliament, which we
hope ſome at leaſt of thoſe Degenerate Wretches may live
to ſee, and in the mean time there will ever be ſome ready
to abhor a Petition ſigned by 60000 Shop-Keepers, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> humbly pretending to inſtruct the King and
Council, in ſpight of a Proclamation to the contrary, when
its fit a Parliament ſhould ſit; which ſome are ſuch fools
as to imagine may be done again without abhorring
Parliaments; and conſequently without breach of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
of Parliament. And becauſe this was all that
was done then, to the beſt of our remembrance, and as it
is conceived may be made appear by thoſe very ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrences
ſtill extant, therefore it is humbly concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the Impriſonments thereupon were Arbitrary and
illegal.</p>
            <p>As to thoſe two Perſons my Author names, of them that
were taken into Cuſtody by Order of Parliament <hi>Sheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
and <hi>Thompſon,</hi> I will raiſe no Conteſt with
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:56346:33"/>
him, becauſe their caſe will depend upon the general
determination.</p>
            <p>The King's Declaration lays down this as a Rule; that for
the Houſe of Commons to take into Cuſtody any Subject, for
matters that have no relation to priviledges of Parliament is
Arbitrary, <hi>i. e.</hi> Illegal.</p>
            <p>This the Author quarrels at, and by a very few Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
endeavours to prove, <hi>That the Houſe of Commons
may order men to be taken into Cuſtody for matters not relating
to priviledge.</hi> Theſe two are directly contrary each to
other, and I only deſire the liberty to enquire which of theſe
ſeem likelieſt to be in the right.</p>
            <p>The Priviledges of the Houſe of Commons are indeed
our own, and they enjoy and ought to uſe them as our
Truſtees, and for our good, and therefore it is folly in us to
leſſen them when they are ſuch as are neceſſary: and it is
a great injury in them to extend them beyond what they
anciently were to the damage of the Crown; or of the
Liberties of the Subjects, or on the other hand to abuſe
thoſe they really have, and ought to enjoy, to our damage,
or to the Detriment of the Kings Prerogative, which is as
neceſſary for our preſervation as the Priviledges of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
themſelves are.</p>
            <p>The Priviledges of Parliament are many, and relate
either to the whole Body, the Three Eſtates taken Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively,
or to the Lords, or to the Commons.</p>
            <p>Thoſe relating to the Commons reſpect either the
King, or the Lords, or the reſt of the Subjects which
are not Members of their Houſe, or the Members of their
own Houſe.</p>
            <p>Our Enquiry is only in this point concerning thoſe that
relate to thoſe Subjects that are not Members of either
Houſe, whether they may be impriſoned by Vote of the
Commons for matters that have no relation to Priviledge
of Parliament.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:56346:34"/>
In the latter end of the Reign of Queen
<hi>Elizabeth</hi> it was a queſtion whether the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
could impriſon thoſe that were not
Members of their own Houſe for matters that
had a certain and apparent relation to the
known Priviledges of Parliament,<note place="margin">Proceedings of the four laſt Parliaments of Q. <hi>Eliz. p. 254. Anno Regni</hi> 44. It ſeems probable to me that this queſtion was then firſt reſolved, by the Arguments brought for it, which uſe not to be in plain caſes; and one Member oppoſed it, and another ſaid many were ſent for, but none appeared, none were puniſhed.</note> as for
Arreſting them or their Servants in time of
Parliament, which hath been ſince gained,
and is no longer Conteſted by any body, but
is a ſtrong Argument that they had not
then that power the Author claims, and for which he
brings the Precedents, which are indeed of a later date
except one, and that was in the Minority of <hi>Edward</hi> the
Sixth.</p>
            <p>Anciently if any man were impeached in Parliament,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cokes</hi> Inſtit. <hi>part.</hi> 4. of the proceedings in Parliament againſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents. <hi>p.</hi> 38.</note>
there was a Writ directed to the Sheriff to ſummon him
to appear and Anſwer, as my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> acquaints us,
and ſets down the form of the Writ; and upon the return
of this Writ the Attachment it is likely went out of the
Houſe of Lords, but of this Power of the Commons that
great man ſpeaks not one word, which is a good Argument
they had it not, and indeed the latter inſtances are all after
his time.</p>
            <p>It is not conſonant to reaſon that any Subject of <hi>England</hi>
ſhould be impriſoned upon a bare ſuggeſtion without the
Oath of the Accuſer: Now the Commons have no power
to give an Oath in this caſe, and therefore it ſeems rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
that they ſhould not impriſon any man who is not
a Member of their Houſe, much leſs whomſoever they
pleaſe.</p>
            <p>The Houſe of Commons is not a Court of Judicature,
(except in matters of Priviledge and Elections) but all
perſons accuſed in Parliament muſt be tried by the
<note n="*" place="margin">Owned by this Author. <hi>p.</hi> 39.</note> Lords, therefore it is contrary to the Law of <hi>England</hi>
that any man ſhould be impriſoned by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:56346:34"/>
who * (<note place="margin">Cokes <hi>Inſtit.</hi> part. 4. p. 24.</note> as the Grand Jury of the Nation) are his
Accuſers.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid that a man taken into Cuſtody by
Order of the Commons is taken in Execution,<note place="margin">Debates of the Houſe of Commons <hi>pag.</hi> 217. A Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitment of this Houſe is always in nature of a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Party not Bailable.</note>
but it is contrary to the eternal Laws of Nature,
and all Nations, that a man ſhould be taken in
Execution before he have made his Defence,
and a legal Sentence be paſſed upon him by
Legal Proceſs and proof.</p>
            <p>It is deſtructive of the Liberty of the Subject that any
man ſhould be ſo taken by them into Cuſtody,<note place="margin">Addreſs to the Freemen, <hi>&amp;c. Part.</hi> 2. p 38.</note> becauſe he
is without all remedy, and if the thing happen to prove
iujurious and oppreſſive, as it did in the Caſe of <hi>John
Wilſon</hi> and <hi>Roger Beckwith</hi> Eſquires, two <hi>Torkſhire</hi> Juſtices
of the Peace, who were notoriouſly injured by it.</p>
            <p>For theſe reaſons, which I ſubmit to wiſer men than my
ſelf, I am humbly of opinion that no man ought to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
into Cuſtody by the Order or Vote of the Commons,
that is not a Member of their Houſe; except it be for
matters relating to the Priviledges of Parliament, and that
ſuch Priviledges as are commonly known; for if they
may call what they pleaſe a Priviledge of a Parliament, it
will in the Event be the ſame thing as an unlimited
power.</p>
            <p>As to all his Inſtances they do not deſerve any conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
except the firſt,<note place="margin">4 Edw. 6. 18 Jac. 20 Jac. 3 Car.</note> and that no man, as he relates it, can
tell by whom the Commitment was made, without the
Record which I cannot come at, and the latter were the
Acts of Popular Parliaments which laid the foundations
of our late troubles by ſuch proceedings.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Author in the next place comes to juſtifie the Votes
againſt the Miniſters, and lays down this as his foundation.</hi>
The Commons in Parliament have uſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 16.</note> two ways of delivering
their Country from pernicious and powerful Favourites, The
one is in a Parliamentary Courſe of Juſtice by impeaching
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:56346:35"/>
them which is uſed when they judge it needful to make them
publick examples, by Capital, or other high puniſhments, for
the terror of others: The other is by immediate Addreſs to
the King to remove them as unfaithful or unprofitable Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.
Their Lives, their Liberties, or Eſtates are never
endangered, but when they are proceeded againſt in the former
of theſe ways: Then legal evidence of their guilt is neceſſary,
then there muſt be a proper time allowed for their defence.
In the other way the Parliament act as the Kings great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
and when either Houſe obſerves that affairs are ill admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred,
that the Advice of Parliaments is rejected or ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the Courſe of Juſtice perverted, our Councils betrayed,
Grievances multiplied, and the Government weakly and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly
managed, (of all which our Laws have made it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
for the King to be guilty,) they neceſſarily muſt, and
always have charged thoſe who had the Adminiſtration
of affairs, and the Kings Ears, as the Authors of theſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs,
and have from time to time applied themſelves to
him by Addreſſes for their removal from his preſence and
Councils.</p>
            <p>So here are all the Miniſters of State that are, or ever
ſhall be, expoſed to the mercy of the Houſe of Commons,
if proof can be brought againſt them, then have at all, Life,
Liberty, and Eſtate muſt go for it; but if none can be had,
then it is but voting them Enemies to the King and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and Addreſſing to have them removed from his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
Preſence and Councils for ever, and the work is
done without allowing the liberty to anſwer for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
And the reaſon that he gives for it is a pleaſant one;
becauſe the King cannot be guilty, therefore they muſt.
But may not a Houſe of Commons be miſtaken, and
puniſh a man for what he never did? may not one man
give the Advice, and another ſuffer for it at this rate of
proceedings? But this is an old Cuſtom; What then, it is an unjuſt
one.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:56346:35"/>
There may be many things plain and evident beyond the
teſtimony of any Witneſs,<note place="margin">Pag. 17.</note> which yet can never be proved in a
legal way.</p>
            <p>This is true; but I hope he will not infer from hence
that any man ſhall be puniſhed for thoſe things without
teſtimony. I always thought all theſe caſes were reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to the Tribunal of God Almighty. And I believe
this Gentleman would be loth to be tried by his own
rule.</p>
            <p>The Parliament may be buſied in ſuch great Affairs,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> as will
not ſuffer them to parſue every Offender through a long
proceſs.</p>
            <p>Then they may let him alone; or leave him to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Law, but to condemn him unheard, for want of lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
is ſuch a piece of juſtice as no man would be willing
to ſubmit to in his own Caſe.</p>
            <p>There may be many reaſons why a man ſhould be turned out
of Service,<note place="margin">Pag. 17.</note> which perhaps would not extend to ſubject him to
puniſhment.</p>
            <p>That there may be reaſons why a man ſhould be turned
out of Service is undeniable, but then thoſe reaſons ought
to be alledged and proved; for the turning a man out of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
is certainly in many caſes a great puniſhment, tho not
equal to hanging.</p>
            <p>The People themſelves are highly concerned in the great
Miniſters of State,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> who are Servants to the Kingdom as well
as to the King; and the Commons, whoſe buſineſs it is to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
all Grievances, as they are moſt likely to obſerve ſooneſt
the folly and treachery of thoſe publick Servants, (the greateſt
of all Grievances) ſo this repreſentation ought to have no little
weight with the Prince.</p>
            <p>Here is the true reaſon as long as the Miniſters look
upon themſelves as the Kings Servants they will adhere to
the Crown, but if they be taught once that they are Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
to the People too, then becauſe it is difficult to ſerve
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:56346:36"/>
two Maſters, they will be more diſtracted, and act more
timorouſly, eſpecially if according to the modern diſtinction
the <hi>Country-Party</hi> get the Aſcendent of the <hi>Court-Party</hi> in
a Parliament.</p>
            <p>Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> told the Commons by the Lord Keeper,<note place="margin">Proceedings of the four laſt Parl. p. 47.</note>
that ſhe miſliked that ſuch irreverence towards Privy-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors, (who were not to be accounted as Common Knights
and Burgeſſes of the Houſe, that are Counſellors but during
the Parliament) whereas the other are ſtanding Counſellors,
and for their Wiſdom and great Service are called to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of State.</p>
            <p>They were not then thought to be ſuch publick Servants
as might be treated at any rate, ſent to the Tower, or to
carry up a Bill to the Lords, againſt which they had given
their Vote, as if it were to triumph over them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But</hi> Henry IV.<note place="margin">Pag. 17.</note> 
               <hi>(a wiſe and a brave Prince)
in the Fifth year of his Reign turned out four of
his Servants,</hi>
               <note place="margin">In hoc Parliamento conceſſa ſuit Regi taxa inſolita &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colis tricabilis, &amp; valde gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis, Walſ. nec ſervarentur ejus Evidentiae in Theſauria Regia. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>only becauſe the Commons deſired
they might be removed.</hi> But then this Prince had
no Title, and therefore was not in a capacity
to diſpute any thing with them;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Polid. Virgil.</hi> Sunorum crebris conjurationi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus vexatus.</note> and in this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Parliament too; they gave him ſo extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
a Tax, and ſo troubleſom to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
that they would not ſuffer any Record of it to be left
in the Treaſury; and he was obliged to grant them this
extraordinary favour in recompence of it. He had but
newly in Battel conquered one Rebellion, wherein <hi>Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers</hi>
Title was at the bottom, and was ingaged then in a
War with <hi>France.</hi> And he had reaſon to fear a general
Defection of the Nation; King <hi>Richard</hi> being reported to
be alive. And he was then in great want of Money, ſo that
for ſuch a Prince ſo beſet to grant any thing was far from a
wonder, but ought no more to be drawn into Example than
that Tax they then gave him; and leaſt of all now, when
things are in a very different poſture.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:56346:36"/>
But then all theſe Miniſters are cenſured for doing that
which was approved by two of the three Eſtates. The
Reſolve was this.</p>
            <p>That all perſons who adviſed his Majeſty in his laſt Meſſage
to this Houſe,<note place="margin">Jan. 7. 1680.</note> to inſiſt upon an opinion againſt the Bill for
Excluding the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> have given pernicious Counſel
to his Majeſty, and are promoters of Popery, and Enemies to
the King and Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Now this Bill was before this thrown out by the Houſe
of Lords, and therefore there was no reaſon to Vote the
Miniſters Enemies to the King and Kingdom for doing
that which was approved by two of the three Eſtates in
Parliament.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But they ought not to have appealed to the People
againſt their own Repreſentatives.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 18.</note> (Why not?) The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
Reigns of <hi>Henry III.</hi> Edward II. Richard II. and
<hi>Henry VI.</hi> ought to ſerve as Land-marks to warn ſucceeding
Kings; from preſerring ſecret Councils to the wiſdom of their
Parliaments.</p>
            <p>And ſo ought the Example of his Majeſties Father to
warn both his Majeſty and the whole Nation how they
ſuffer the Miniſters of State to be trodden under foot by
Factious men; and the Prerogatives of the Crown to be
ſwallowed up, by pretended Priviledges of Parliament.
for all theſe things have once already made way for the
Ruine of the Monarchy; as that did for the enſlaving of
the People.</p>
            <p>The next thing my Author falls upon is the buſineſs of
the Revenue, but here I cannot imagine what he would
have, he makes a long Harangue againſt Alienation of the
Revenues of the Crown, and about the reaſonableneſs of
Reſumptions of thoſe that had been alienated. And
tells us,<note place="margin">Pag. 19.</note> No Country did ever believe the Prince, how
abſolute ſoever in other things, had power to ſell or give
away the Revenue of the Kingdom, and leave his Succeſſor a
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:56346:37"/>
Beggar. That the haughty French Monarch, as much power
as he pretends to, is not aſhamed to own that he wanted power
to make ſuch Alienations, and that Kings had that happy ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
that they could do nothing contrary to the Laws of their
Country.</p>
            <p>This and much more my Author hath upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
learnedly, but very impertinently, written about theſe
two Votes, believing his Reader could not diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
an Alienation and an Anticipation.</p>
            <p>But the beſt way to have this clearly underſtood is to
inſert the Votes of the Commons, which are as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth:</p>
            <p>Reſolved,<note place="margin">There were two Votes of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture paſſed in 1626 concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tonnage and Poundage. <hi>Nalſons</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to his Collections. <hi>pag.</hi> 60.</note> That whoſoever ſhall hereafter lend, or cauſe
to be lent, by way of Advance, any money upon the Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of the Kings Revenue, ariſing by Cuſtoms, Exciſe, or
Hearth-money, ſhall be adjudged to hinder the ſitting of
Parliaments, and ſhall be reſponſible for the ſame in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
            <p>Reſolved, That whoſoever ſhall accept or buy any Tally of
Anticipation upon any part of the Kings Revenue (or whoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
ſhall pay ſuch Tally hereafter to be ſtruck, ſhall be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged
to hinder the ſitting of Parliaments, and ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſible
therefore in Parliament.</p>
            <p>Now what Advancing money upon the Revenues, and
accepting Tallys of Anticipation have to do with Aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it I cannot deviſe. For certainly it is one thing to
advance a Fine, and take a Farm ſo much the cheaper for
three, four, or ſeven years, and another thing to purchaſe
the ſame to a man and his Heirs for ever. And it is one
thing to receive an Order to take ſuch a Sum of Money
of the Tenant out of the next half years Rent. and a
quite other thing to purchaſe the Feeſimple of an Eſtate,
which is an Alienation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Revenues of the Crown of</hi> England <hi>are in their own
nature appropriated to Publick Service,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 19.</note> 
               <hi>and therefore cannot
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:56346:37"/>
without injuſtice be diverted or Anticipated.</hi> May not an
Anticipation be as well imployed upon the Publick Service
as a growing Revenue when it is become due? Does Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation
ſignifie miſpending or diverting from a Publick to
a private uſe? Is it impoſſible the Publick ſhould at any
time need a greater Sum of money than the Revenue will
afford, and may not a Prince in ſuch a caſe Anticipate,
and afterward get it up again by his good Husbandry:
No, for</p>
            <p>Either the Publick Revenue is ſufficient to anſwer the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
occaſions of the Government,<note place="margin">Pag. 19.</note> and then there is no colour
for Anticipations, or elſe by ſome extraordinary Accident the
King is reduced to want an extraordinary ſupply, and then he
ought to reſort to his Parliament.</p>
            <p>Well, but ſuppoſe (as it may happen) the neceſſity is
ſo urgent, that it cannot be put off till a Parliament can be
called, and meet, and raiſe money. Or if you pleaſe,
ſuppoſe a Parliament dare not truſt the King with money,
or, which is all one, will pretend ſo. Or will not ſupply
him unleſs he will paſs an Act that they ſhall ſit as long as
they pleaſe; or unleſs he will let them turn out what Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
of State, Juſtices of the Peace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they think ſit,
and put in others as they pleaſe. May not a Prince relieve
himſelf in theſe caſes by an Advance or Anticipation, but
muſt ſubmit abſolutely to the Commons? I hope he will not
ſay theſe are impoſſible accidents.</p>
            <p>Our Anceſtors did wiſely provide that the King and his
People ſhould have frequent need of one another,<note place="margin">Pag. 20.</note> and by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
frequent opportunities of mutually relieving one anothers
wants, be ſure ever to preſerve a dutiful affection in the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
and a Fatherly tenderneſs in the Prince. When the King
had occaſion for the liberality of his People he would be well
inclined to hear and redreſs their Grievances, and when they
wanted eaſe from oppreſſions, they would not fail with alacrity
to ſupply the occaſions of the Crown.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:56346:38"/>
All this is certainly true, and was the very reaſon why
the two firſt Parliaments of his Majeſties Reign, of whoſe
Loyalty and hearty affections to the Crown no man ever
doubted, ſetled part of the Revenue on his Majeſty for his
Life only, that his Succeſſor might be obliged by a regrant
of it. And the whole which they gave to this King was
but equal to the conſtant and regular Expences of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
as they deſigned it, tho it is ſaid it falls ſhort of
that too.</p>
            <p>Now, might things be thus carried, as my Author tells
us, they were deſigned to be, <hi>England</hi> would certainly
be the happieſt Nation in the World. The King would be
as rich as his People could make him, and the People as
happy as a tender and good King could make them. But
alas! there is ſprung up a new Generation of men who
have taken ſuch an Averſion for Monarchy, and the juſt
Prerogatives of the Crown, that till theſe Grievances (the
greateſt Grievances that ever can betide a free-born people)
be totally taken away, they can find no guſt in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval
of all thoſe other petty Grievances, of which
our Anceſtors complained ſo often, and as often found
redreſs.</p>
            <p>There is alſo ariſen a ſort of ſober Proteſtants (as the
Diſſenters will needs be called) who can neither agree one
with another, nor with the Religion that is Eſtabliſhed, and
to them it is an intolerable Grievance to ſee Epiſcopacy,
a Liturgy, and a few innocent Ceremonies, which they
call Popery, eſtabliſhed in the Church, and till theſe
are extirpated Root and Branch, and every of their pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Whimſies ſetled ſucceſſively in the place of them,
or tolerated at once, they, good men! cannot be at eaſe
neither.</p>
            <p>Theſe two have twiſted their intereſts together with a
third ſort that have no Religion at all, but have a damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
inclination to the Spoils of the Church, and the Plunder
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:56346:38"/>
of the Nation. And they by Popular Arts have wheedled
and deluded great numbers of the Freemen and Freeholders
of the Nation into a ſtrong belief that Popery is by our
Governours deſigned to be ſet up in the Church, and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary
Government in the State, things which theſe good
men hate mightily, as there is good reaſon for it, but are
very much abuſed by the Information, and much more by
being perſuaded, as they have been, that the chuſing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented
men to be their Repreſentatives in the Houſe of
Commons was the only way to prevent theſe two dreadful
things from falling upon them.</p>
            <p>Theſe men however have ſometimes got to be the major
part of that Houſe, and the Conſequence hath ever been
that the King could get no Supplies, be his neceſſities what
they could be, unleſs he would grant ſuch things as tended
immediately to the ruine of the Church and Monarchy.
And if he were a little averſe to it, then he was preſently
Libelled to the Nation as a favourer of Popery, and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigner
of Arbitrary Government; but if it were not ſafe
to attack him, then (according to the method of the late
Rebels) the cry was raiſed againſt the Evil Counſellors,
or the Corrupt Miniſters, and nothing would do, but
the turning them out of their employments as treacherous
Servants to the Kingdom, for being too faithful to the
King.</p>
            <p>And becauſe they can never effect theſe great things by
other means, they have always turned this excellent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
againſt it ſelf, and that which was intended to
endear the King and his People each to others, their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
want of each others aſſiſtance, hath been made a
Steppal to mount the Throne, and pluck down the Mitre.
So that his Majeſty, who knew how things went in his
Father's days, was not out when he told the Commons in

               <hi>This Parliament underſtood things well, and provided
accordingly, ſo that the nineteenth of</hi> May <hi>following, the
Lord Chancellor, in a Speech made at their Prorogation,
told them,</hi> They had wiſely, very wiſely provided ſuch a
conſtant growing Revenue as may with Gods bleſſing preſerve
the Crown from thoſe ſcandalous wants and neceſſities as have
heretofore expoſed it and the Kingdom to thoſe diſmal miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,<note place="margin">☜</note>
from which they are but even now buoyed up; for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
other humane cauſes may be aſſigned,<note place="margin">☜</note> according to the
ſeveral fancies and imaginations of men, of our late miſerable
diſtractions, they cannot be ſo reaſonably imputed to any one
cauſe, as to the extreme poverty of the Crown: the want of
power could never have appeared, if it had not been for the
want of money.</p>
            <p>But ſince that, the riſing greatneſs of our Neighbours
have mounted the Expences of the Crown above that
growing Revenue that was then ſetled, and the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
Party, as his Majeſty ſtiles them, promiſe themſelves
the happineſs of bringing about another Revolution, by
the ſame means the laſt was, in his Majeſties days, if it be
poſſible, but however at his Death. And therefore if the
Crown thus beſet ſhall at any time make uſe of Anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to relieve it ſelf; they only ought to be reſponſible
for it, who have, or ſhall, make it neceſſary: For ſurely no
Prince would borrow, when he might have it freely given
upon reaſonable terms, unleſs he took a pride in counting the
number of his Creditors.</p>
            <p>And therefore <hi>(ſaith my Author)</hi> it has ever been eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a Crime in Counſellors,<note place="margin">Pag. 20.</note> who perſuaded the King to Antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate
his Revenue, and a Crime in thoſe who furniſh'd money
upon ſuch Anticipations in an extraordinary way, however
extraordinary, the occaſion might be. For this cauſe it was
that the Parliament in the 35 of <hi>Henry VIII.</hi> did not only
diſcharge all theſe Debts which the King had contracted; but
Enacted that thoſe Lenders, who had been before paid again
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:56346:40"/>
by the King, ſhould refund all thoſe Sums into the Exchequer,
as judging it reaſonable puniſhment to make them forfeit the
Money they lent, ſince they have gone about to introduce ſo
dangerous a precedent.</p>
            <p>It is bad Logick that raiſeth general Concluſions from
particular inſtances, and it will appear ſo in this that
we have in hand; which, becauſe I cannot ſo well and

               <p>Now obſerve the Cataſtrophe in the ſame Parliament
of 32 <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. when the great and opulent Priory
of St. <hi>Johns of Jeruſalem</hi> was given to the King, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
and had a Subſidy both of the Clergy and
Laity, and the like he had in 34 <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. and in
37 <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. he had another Subſidy. And ſince the
diſſolution of the ſaid Monaſteries he exacted divers
Loans, and againſt Law received the ſame.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Now let my Reader judge if it be reaſonable to make
what the Parliament did in the 25 of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Rule for all ſucceeding times, when it is morally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
that ever any King of <hi>England</hi> ſhould have ſuch a
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:56346:41"/>
Treaſure and Revenue as they had given this King within
leſs than ſeven years, and a Subſidy but the very year
before beſides. If we had ſuch Parliaments now, and it
were poſſible to give the King ſuch Supplies as they did,
I would freely give my Vote to have the next Lender
Hanged.</p>
            <p>The true way to put the King out of a poſſibility of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
the Government,<note place="margin">Pag. 20.</note> is <hi>to let</hi> him waſte in one year that
money which ought to bear the charge of the Government for
ſeven.</p>
            <p>But, Sir, to put you out of pain for that, this would
neceſſitate the ſitting of Parliaments, and the yielding to
whatſoever they could deſire. So this, tho true, was not
the reaſon of the Vote, but directly contrary to it; but
the King knows the Conſequence of that too well to need
any reſtraint in that particular, for he knows as well as
you; that this is the direct method to deſtroy not only the
Credit of the Crown at home and abroad, but the Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy
it ſelf.</p>
            <p>If the King reſolves never to pay the money that he bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note>
what faith will be given to the Royal Promiſes, and
the honour of the Nation will ſuffer in that of the Prince.
And if it be put upon the People to repay it, this would be a
way to impoſe a neceſſity of giving Taxes without end whether
they would or no.</p>
            <p>Omitting the undutifulneſs of theſe ſuppoſitions, it is
very remarkable, that the great Anticipations upon the
Revenue were made in the time of the laſt Dutch War,
when they who now ſo much clamour againſt them were
Miniſters, and they who now are ſuch, and bear all the
blame, were not in a capacity to hinder it. Whether they
had any ſuch intentions as theſe in it, they beſt know, but
I am ſure one of them made it out powerfully that there
was all the reaſon in the world that the Parliament ſhould
pay off this debt. <hi>But,</hi> ſaith my Author, <hi>as mercenary as
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:56346:41"/>
they were, the Penſioners would never diſcharge the Revenue
of theſe Anticipations to the Bankers.</hi> Which is an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
and convincing Argument that they (how much ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they are ſlandered) were not ſuch mercenary Penſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners,
as the world is now told they were.</p>
            <p>Now, as he tells us, the W. Commons made this
Vote purely to keep people from being again chouſed the
ſame way, and in mere pity to the Cries of many Widows
and Orphans. And truly, if they had taken care to have
had thoſe that wanted this Caution firſt paid off, the
world might have poſſibly thought ſo. And <hi>then a Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
that ſuch ſecurities were void, and that no future Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
could without breach of Truſt repay that Money which
was at firſt borrowed only to prevent the ſitting of Parliaments,</hi>
might have had a better reception in this Kingdom than the
two Votes they made without it. As for his quotation
of 1 <hi>R. 3. Cap.</hi> 2. againſt Loans, that and all the after
Statutes is againſt involuntary and forcible taking of
money.</p>
            <p>But the Commons were very modeſt,<note place="margin">Pag. 21.</note> and reſtrained their
Votes to only three branches of the Revenue, all which
were by ſeveral Acts of Parliament given to his preſent
Majeſty.</p>
            <p>Sir, I think the laſt Vote is general, and extends to the
whole Revenue, tho the firſt doth not, but only to thoſe
three ſmall Branches of Cuſtoms, Exciſe, and Hearth mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.
A modeſt reſtraint indeed.</p>
            <p>The Statute 12 Car.<note place="margin">Pag. 21.</note> 2. Cap. 4. ſays, That the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
repoſing Truſt in his Majeſty, for guarding the Se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s
againſt all perſons intending the diſtarbance of Trade, and
the invading of the Realm to that intent do give him Toanage
and Poundage, and this is as direct an appropriation as word,
can make, and therefore as it is a manifeſt wrong to the Subject
to divert any part thereof to other uſes, ſo for the King to
Anticipate it, is plainly to diſable himſelf to perform the truſt
repoſed in him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:56346:42"/>
Now here are ſeveral ill Conſequences from an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
true Principle. For it is no wrong to the Subject
to divert a part of it to other uſes if the Seas can be
guarded, and the Realm ſecured with leſs than the whole,
ar they have been very well all his Majeſties Reign hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto.
Secondly, An Anticipation may be neceſſary to
attain the ends of the truſt if Parliaments ſhall ſtill go on
to refuſe the King extraordinary Supplies upon extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
occaſions.</p>
            <p>The Statute of 12 Car.<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 2, Cap. 23. which did impower the
King to diſpoſe of the Exciſe did Enact, that ſuch Contracts
ſhall be effectual in Law, ſo as they be not for longer time
than three years. <hi>So that here is care taken before their Vote
that no great Advance or Anticipation ſhall be taken upon
that Branch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Statute of the 13.<note place="margin">Pag. 22.</note> and 14. of Car. 2. Cap. 10. declares
that the Hearth-money was given that the publick Revenue
might be proportioned to the Publick Charge, and it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
that ſhould ever be whilſt it is liable to be preingaged
and Anticipated.</p>
            <p>Is it ſo? Muſt a Prince act to the utmoſt of his power
with leſs prudence and diſcretion than other men? Muſt
I needs Sell or Morgage my Eſtate for as much as it is
worth; becauſe I may do it, and no man can hinder
me?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Parliament took another care in relation to this Branch,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 22.</note>
               <hi>and made it penal for any one ſo much as to accept of any
Penſion or Grant for years, or any other Eſtate, or any Sum of
Money out of the Revenue ariſing by (Hearth-money) by
virtue of that Act, from the King, his Heirs or Succeſſors,</hi>
as my Author takes notice: and now what reaſon was
there for him to make ſuch a Splutter as he did about Alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
and leaving the Succeſſor a beggar, when one of
theſe Branches, the Cuſtoms and half the Exciſe is given
to his Majeſty only for life, and ſuch care is taken to
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:56346:42"/>
keep the third unchargeable by the very Act that gave
it? If theſe things tend to the vindication either of my
Author, or the Votes, I have loſt my Reaſon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Author concludes with this ſmart reflection on the
Declaration,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 22.</note> This we are ſure of, that if the inviolable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of theſe Statutes <hi>(it ſhould have been Votes)</hi>
will reduce his Majeſty to a more helpleſs Condition than the
meaneſt of his Subjects, he will ſtill be left in a better Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
than the richeſt and greateſt of his Anceſtors, none of
which were ever matters of ſuch a Revenue.</p>
            <p>The King complains of the Votes, and the Statutes
are craftily laid in the way to bear the brunt; the intention
of a thing may poſſibly never ſucceed, as I hope it never
will here: But yet the complaint is juſt, if it apparently
tended to ſuch an end, tho it never follow. But how his
Majeſty can be in the moſt helpleſs and moſt wealthy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
at one and the ſame time, <hi>in fact,</hi> my Author muſt
inform us. His Majeſties Expence as well as Revenue is
above all his Royal Anceſtors, and whatever his Revenue
is he was not beholden to theſe Voters for it, who gave him
nothing but paper and trouble. And of the firſt of theſe
his Majeſty had ſuch a quantity; that he is ſaid to have
chid his Tailor for not making his Pockets big enough to
receive it. His Coſſers in the mean time were not ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged.
nor like to ſurfeit.</p>
            <p>The next thing my Author falls upon is the Vote for
ſuſpenſion of the Execution of the Penal Laws againſt the
Diſſenters; which he firſt recites, and then juſtiſieth, and
I will follow him.</p>
            <p>The Houſe of Commons are in the next place accuſed of a
very high Crime,<note place="margin">Pag. 22.</note> the aſſuming to themſelves a power of
ſuſpending Acts of Parliament, becauſe they declared it was
their Opinion. <hi>That the proſecutier of Proteſtant Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
upon the Penal Laws, is at this time grievous to the
Subject, a weakning of the Proteſtant Intereſt, an incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:56346:43"/>
to Popery, and dangerous to the Peace of the
Nation.</hi> The Miniſters remembred that not many years ago,
the whole Nation was juſtly Alarm'd upon the aſſuming an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary
power of ſuſpending Penal Laws, and therefore they
thought it would be very popular to accuſe the Commons of ſuch
an Attempt.</p>
            <p>Did the Miniſters remember how the Nation was
Alarm'd, and had the Commons forgot it? Well. let us
follow the Gentleman, and ſee how he will clear his
Commons from the guilt of this high Crime which he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth
was ſo juſtly blamed in the Miniſters.</p>
            <p>But how they (the Miniſters) could poſſibly miſinterpret
a Vote at that rate,<note place="margin">Pag. 22.</note> how they could ſay the Commons pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to a power of repealing Laws, when they only declare their
opinion of the inconveniency of them, will never be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
till the Authors of this are pleaſed to ſhew their Cauſes
and Reaſons in a ſecond Declaration.</p>
            <p>The charge in the Declaration is that by this Vote, <hi>They
aſſumed to themſelves a power of ſuſpending Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
without any regard to the Laws eſtabliſhed.</hi> This
the Author could not deny, nor defend; and therefore he
changeth the terms into a power of Repealing Laws, with
which the Commons were never charged. Now, a power
of Suſpending and a power of Recpealing are vaſtly diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.
Every Pardon is a ſuſpenſion of the Execution of the
Law in relation to the Party pardoned, and ſo is every
Diſpenſation; and when the King put forth the Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for Liberty of Conſcience, there was no deſign of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing,
but only of ſuſpending the Execution of the Penal
Laws <hi>pro tempore;</hi> ſo that if the Commons deſigned this
Vote or Declaration of theirs ſhould have any other effect
than to ſhew their good will to the Diſſenters, it muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
tho not to a Repeal, yet to a ſuſpenſion of the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Penal Laws againſt them, which is all the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
charged the Commons with; and ſo the Diſſenters
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:56346:43"/>
underſtood it, and have ſince pleaded this Vote in Bar to
the Execution of thoſe Laws againſt them, tho they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
they are not Repealed thereby.</p>
            <p>Every impartial man will own that the Commons had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
for this opinion of theirs.<note place="margin">Pag. 22.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Suppoſe they had reaſon for it, this will not give them a
legal Power. The King hath good reaſon to do many
things which yet if he ſhould offer at, they would clamour
againſt him as an Uſurper of an Arbtrary Power; for rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
gives no man any Author; to act, except he hath a
lawful power to back his reaſon with. There may be
great reaſon to repeat an Act of Parliament, and yet in all
the Judges in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> ſhould thereupon declare it to be
either ſuſpended or repealed, I know what we ſhould hear
of it quickly. Well, but let us hear their Reaſons.<note place="margin">Pag. 22.</note>
            </p>
            <p>They had with great anxiety obſerved that the preſent
deſign of the Papiſts was not againſt any one ſort of Prete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,
but <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap> extirpating the Reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>That this might be the ultimate deſign of the Plot, is
not much to be doubted, but it was immediately bent only
againſt the Religion eſtabliſhed, and accodingly ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were
Succeſſors appointed to all the Biſhops and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
Clergy, but none to Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> and the reſt
of that Fry that ever I heard of. So that this reaſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
not in favour of the Diſſenters, but of the Regular
Clergy, who as they were in moſt danger ought to
have been moſt taken care of. But this Vote left them in
the ſame danger it found them of being deſtroyed by the
Papiſts, and let looſe the Diſſenters upon them too, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
that danger.</p>
            <p>2.<note place="margin">Pag. 23.</note> They ſaw what advantages theſe Enemies made of our
Diviſions, and how cunningly they diverted us from perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them by fomenting our Jealouſies of one another.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:56346:44"/>
Did they not, Sir obſerve too how the Diſſenters took
the occaſion of the Plot, and of the general hatred againſt
Popery to ruine the Loyal and Conformable Clergy? How
they preſently engroſſed the Title of Proteſtant, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to make the Rabble believe that all but the
Bobtail Holders forth and their Followers were Papiſts in
Maſquerade, Tories, Tantivimen, &amp;c. If they did not
obſerve theſe things, others did. And alſo that all of a
ſudden all the Jeſuits aſſumed the ſhapes of Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts,
and railed ſtoutly againſt Biſhops, Ceremonies,
Humane Impoſitions, and Arbitrary Government. They
knew there was no Poſſibility of eſcaping the vengeance
of the Church of <hi>England</hi> men but by ſetting the Diſſenters
upon them, and they needed no Spur. So this was a good
Argument to have taught the Diſſenters more modeſty;
but ſince they had not that, it was a ſtrong Argument to
have ſuppreſs'd them vigorouſly as the only Auxiliaries of
the Papiſts againſt the Church; and the great hinderers of
the proſecution of the Plot.</p>
            <p>3. They ſaw the ſtrength and nearneſs of the King of <hi>France,</hi>
and judged of his inclinations by his uſage of his own Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Subjects.</p>
            <p>4. They conſidered the number, and the bloudy Principles
of the Iriſh. And</p>
            <p>5. That <hi>Scotland</hi> was already delivered into the hands of
a Prince, the known head of the Papiſts in theſe Kingdoms, and
the occaſion of their Plots and Inſolencies, as more than one
Parliament had declared. <hi>(It ſhould have been worded
thus) as they had declared in more than one Parliament, for
theſe were the ſame men in ſeveral Parliaments, who made
theſe ſeveral Declarations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I cannot conceive wherein the force of theſe three
Arguments lies, the French King was powerful, and hated
Proteſtants, therefore the Church of <hi>England</hi> muſt be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for ruine by giving as many as pleaſed a free liberty
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:56346:44"/>
to ſeparate from her, and procure her deſtruction. The Iriſh
Papiſts had ill deſigns juſt ripe for execution, therefore the
Engliſh Nonconformiſts were to be tolerated that they
might get ſtrength, and be able to riſe at the ſame time, to
aſcertain the deſtruction of the Church.</p>
            <p>But the fifth Reaſon is much better; <hi>Scotland</hi> was in
the hands of the Duke, How came he by it? What, did
he invade it by force and violence againſt his Majeſties Will?
If he did, then let us make a mighty Combination againſt
him: But if it were delivered to him by the proper Owner,
who may govern it by whom he pleaſe, what occaſion is
there for the Diſſenters ſervice here?</p>
            <p>6.<note place="margin">Pag. 23.</note> They could not but take notice into what hands the moſt
conſiderable Truſts both Civil and Military were put.</p>
            <p>7. And that notwithſtanding all Addreſſes, and all Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
for a ſtrict execution of the Penal Laws againſt
Papiſts, yet their Faction ſo far prevailed that they were
eluded, and only the Diſſenting Proteſtants ſmarted under the
rage of them.</p>
            <p>That they took very good notice who were imployed
in Civil and Military Truſts appears by the Addreſs of
<hi>December</hi> 21. 1680. not many days before this Vote,
where they tell the King, <hi>That ſeveral Deputy Lieutenants
and Juſtices of the Peace, fitly qualified for thoſe imployments,
have been of late diſplaced, and others put in their room, who
are men of Arbitrary Principles, and Countenancers of Papiſts
and Popery.</hi> Theſe they would have had turned out, and
others put in; who are men of <hi>Integrity and known affection
to the Proteſtant Religion;</hi> and may be moreover <hi>men of
Ability, of Eſtates and Intereſt in their Country.</hi> His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
knew what they meant, but did not think fit to
change his choice; and the truth is they gave him no great
encouragement by their own carriage to have any more to
do with theſe able, wealthy, popular men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:56346:45"/>
And therefore it ſeems this was one reaſon that moved
them to Vote the Proteſtant Diſſenters free from Penal
Laws, either to keep them out of the hands of theſe
evil Truſtees both Civil and Military; or elſe to make a
Party out of them not only againſt the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> but
alſo againſt theſe Countenancers of Papiſts and Popery;
that is, againſt his Majeſties Officers both Civil and
Military. As if becauſe the French King, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his great Power and Averſion to the Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
could not hurt the Church of <hi>England,</hi> therefore the
Diſſenters were to be careſſed and cheriſhed, that they in
a ſmall time might be in a capacity to do it. And now if
theſe were not good reaſons for the Vote, let any impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
man (that is, any but a Church of <hi>England</hi> man)
judge.<note place="margin">Pag. 23.</note>
            </p>
            <p>In the midſt of ſuch Circumſtances was there not cauſe to
think an <hi>Union</hi> of all Proteſtants neceſſary, and could they
have any juſt grounds to believe that the Diſſenters, whilſt they
lay under the preſſures of ſevere Laws, ſhould with ſuch Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity
and Courage as was requiſite, undertake the defence of a
Country where they were ſo ill treated?</p>
            <p>Whether this queſtion relates to the French King and the
Papiſts, or the Duke and the Civil and Military Officers
may be a queſtion, and therefore it muſt be ſo anſwered.
As to the firſt, there was all the reaſon in the world that
they ſhould joyn heartily with the Government againſt
the Papiſts and French, for they could not hope to mend
their condition by falling into their hands, who they knew
would treat them with other manner of ſeverities than
thoſe they met with from the Laws; if they did not know
this, any of the French Proteſtants that fled over <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap>
               <hi>England</hi> might have informed them ſufficiently. N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>w,
of evils the leaſt is to be choſen, and tho their con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
had not been equal to their deſires, yet it had been
a madneſs to have made it worſe by delivering up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:56346:45"/>
and their Country into the hands of the French and
Papiſts.</p>
            <p>But if it relates to the Duke, and the Civil and Military
Officers, then I hope he will excuſe me if I do not think
it fit to have another Union of Proteſtants of that ſort
again.</p>
            <p>A long and ſad Experience had ſhewed,<note place="margin">Pag. 23.</note> how vain the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
of former Parliaments had been to force us to be all
of one<note n="*" place="margin">Suppoſe that the Church of <hi>England</hi> were diſarmed of all thoſe Laws by which ſhe is guarded; and would not this turn a National Church into nothing elſe but a Tolerated Sect or Party? Would it not take away all appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Eſtabliſhment from it? <hi>Lord Chancellors Speech, April</hi> 13. 75. Would this Unite us in one Affection?</note> 
               <hi>Opinion,</hi> and therefore the Houſe of Commons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to take a ſure way to make us all of one <hi>Affection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was the very reaſon of the Declaration of Liberty
of Conſcience: But how unlike that courſe was to prevail,
the Nation had ſufficient experience in a few years. And,
Sir, I can aſſure you, it is above the power of a Houſe of
Commons to unite thoſe men in Affection, who differ not
only in Opinion, but Practice too, in matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>For theſe reaſons my Author ſaith this Vote was made
in order to a repeal of them by a Bill to be brought in, and
preſently he grows Pettiſh,<note place="margin">Pag. 24.</note> and tells us, <hi>None but a French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
could have the confidence to declaim againſt a proceeding
ſo regular and Parliamentary as this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Your humble Servant Sir, I pray be a little pacified,
you may poſſibly be miſtaken as well as another man, but
would, I believe, take it a little unkindly to be called Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
preſently. They very firſt Vote they made that day
was this:</hi> Reſolved, That whoſoever adviſed his Majeſty to
Prorogue this Parliament, to any other purpoſe than in order to
the paſſing of a Bill for the Excluſion of <hi>James</hi> Duke of <hi>York,</hi>
is a betrayer of the King, the Proteſtant Religion, and of the
Kingdom of <hi>England;</hi> a promoter of the French intereſt,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:56346:46"/>
               <hi>and a Penſioner to</hi> France. So they knew they were to be
Prorogued that very day, and as the Story goes, made
more than ordinary haſte to paſs theſe Votes. Now, it
was impoſſible that a Bill ſhould be brought in, much leſs
paſſed in that Seſſion which was to end before night, and
therefore this was not, nor could not be the cauſe of that
Vote, and all your little Queries, founded upon this ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſition,
are ſilly and impertinent.<note place="margin">Pag. 24.</note>
            </p>
            <p>There was not the leaſt direction or ſignification to the
judges which might give any occaſion for the reflection which
follows in the Declaration. The due and impartial execution
of the Laws, is the unqueſtionable duty of the Judges, and we
hope they will always remember that duty ſo well, as not to
neceſſitate a Houſe of Commons to do theirs, by calling them
to account for making private inſtructions the Rule of their
judgments, and acting as men who have more regard to their
Places than their Oaths.</p>
            <p>So the Diſſenters may ſee they are miſtaken when they
think the Judges or Juſtices may forbear executing the
Laws againſt them upon the ſcore of this Vote.<note place="margin">Ibid.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But tho the Judges are ſworn to execute all Laws, yet there
is no obligation upon any man to inform againſt another.</p>
            <p>No Sir, Is not every Grand-Jury man, every Conſtable,
and Churchwarden ſworn to Preſent the breakers of our
Laws as well as the Judges are to puniſh them? And as for
the next Conundrams of yours, the comparing a parcel of
Laws made within twenty years, to thoſe Antiquated
ones about Caps, and Bows and Arrows, and killing of
Lambs and Calves, and your buſineſs of <hi>Empſon</hi> and
<hi>Dudley,</hi> they are ſuch ſtuff as a man of half your under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
would have been aſhamed to have menſioned in a
good cauſe.</p>
            <p>In the next place my Author acquaints us what are the
cauſes uſually of diſuſing Laws,<note place="margin">Pag. 25.</note> alterations of the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
whereupon a Law was made; or if it be againſt
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:56346:46"/>
the genious of a People, or have effects contrary to the
intents of the Maker, none of which can be ſaid in this
caſe. Nor is that true which follows, that the quiet,
ſafety, or trade of our Nation hath been promoted by the
not executing of theſe Laws, as any man may know that
can remember but ten years backward. <hi>And therefore
notwithſtanding the Vote of the Commons, the Judges may
act wiſely and honeſtly if they ſhould encourage Informers, or
quicken Juries by ſtrict and ſevere Charges. For the due and
impartial execution of the Laws is the unqueſtionable duty
of the Judges,</hi> according to my Author, and therefore I will
hope they ſhall not be accounted Knaves or Fools for doing
their unqueſtionable duty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But then my Author hath another quarrel with the
Miniſters, and that was for numbring this Vote amongſt
the cauſes of</hi> the Diſſolution of that Parliament when the
Black Rod was at the door of the Houſe,<note place="margin">Pag. 25.</note> to require them
to attend his Majeſty at the very time when it was
made.</p>
            <p>Well, ſuppoſe we ſhould grant that this was not one of
thoſe Votes that occaſioned the Prerogation, it not being
then made when that was reſolved on, yet it might occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
their Diſſolution, which hapned ſome time after.
And was not this an excellent time to make Votes for
the bringing in of Bills for the Repeal of Laws when the
Black Rod was at the door to call the Houſe to a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation?</p>
            <p>After a little anger againſt the Miniſters for arraigning
one of the Three Eſtates, in the face of the World, for
uſurping power over the Laws, impriſoning their fellow
Subjects, Arbitrarily expoſing the Kingdom to the greateſt
dangers, and indeavouring to deprive the King of all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of ſupporting the Government,<note place="margin">Pag. 11, 20.</note> (the man hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
how often he hath arraigned the Long Loyal Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
for a parcel of Mercenary Penſioners) he in the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:56346:47"/>
next place falls foul upon the Clergy for publiſhing this
Declaration like an Excommunication in all Churches.<note place="margin">Pag. 26.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But if they <hi>(the Miniſters)</hi> erred in the things they
judged rightly in the choice of the perſons who were to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
it. Blind Obedience was requiſite, where ſuch unju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifiable
things were impoſed, and that could be no where ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
as amongſt thoſe Clergy-men whoſe preferment depended
upon it.</p>
            <p>Yes, without doubt, ten thouſand Clergy-men did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
to be preferred preſently for this piece of blind Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.
Yet he is at it again in the next page, a Set of
Presbyterian Clergy would not have been ſo tame. Well,
but this would not have done tho, <hi>If the Paper, which was
to be read in the Desk, had not been ſo ſuitable to the Doctrine
which ſome of them had often declared in the Pulpit.</hi> Then
it did not go againſt their Conſciences.</p>
            <p>It did not become them to inquire whether they had ſufficient
Authority for what they did, ſince the Printer calls it the
Kings Declaration.</p>
            <p>No; Where, or of whom ſhould they have enquired?
And it being Printed by the Kings Printer, with his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
Royal Arms before it, and ſent them by their Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries
the Biſhops, they had no reaſon to queſtion whether
it were the Kings or no. And there was as little reaſon
that they ſhould concern themſelves, <hi>Whether they might
not one day be called to an account for publiſhing it.</hi> They
had reaſon to truſt that his Majeſty, who commanded
them to do it, would protect them in their blind Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
<hi>And as for his Law-Quirks, whether what his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
ſingly Ordered when he ſate in Council, and came forth
without the Stamp of the Great Seal, gave them a ſufficient
warrant to read in publickly.</hi> Theſe things never entered
into their heads.</p>
            <p>Well, but Sir, tho thoſe <hi>ſame Clergy-men, driven on by
Ambition, might act in this without fear or ſhame, and think
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:56346:47"/>
as little of a Parliament, as the Court Favourites, who took
care to diſſolve that at</hi> Oxford, <hi>before they durſt tell us the
faults of that at</hi> Weſtminiſter. Tho it might be ſo as you
ſay, yet the Shoal of Addreſſors that came in to thank his
Majeſty for that Declaration, they had more light; and,
Sir, if you be reſolved to call all theſe Miniſters, all theſe
Clergy-men, all theſe Addreſſors to an account in the
next Parliament, pray for cold weather, and long days, and
another Parliament, that may ſit for ever if it pleaſe, or
you may happen to want time to go through with ſo pious
and good a work.</p>
            <p>But Sir, tho the Miniſters durſt not diſcover the faults
of the <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Parliament till they had taken care to
diſſolve that <hi>Oxford,</hi> his Majeſty in his Speech there, did.
Which he began thus:</p>
            <p>The unwarrantable proceedings of the laſt
Houſe of Commons were the occaſion of my
parting with the laſt Parliament:<note place="margin">The gracious Speech there made, and the gracious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration that followed, are ſo much of a piece that we may juſtly conclude the ſame perſons to have been the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of both. <hi>Pag. 27. of this Book.</hi>
               </note> For I, who
will never uſe Arbitrary Government my ſelf,
am reſolved not to ſuffer it in others. I am
unwilling to mention particulars, becauſe I am deſirous
to forget faults, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that you may ſee if you pleaſe that the <hi>Oxford</hi> Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was told in general the faults of that which preceded
in order to their avoiding them, if they could have made
that good uſe of his Majeſties Advice, which will render
them the leſs excuſable to all the world.</p>
            <p>So now we come to that Parliament at <hi>Oxford,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 27.</note> which ſaith
the Declaration was aſſembled as ſoon as that was diſſolved;
and <hi>(ſaith my Author)</hi> might have added, Diſſolved as
ſoon as Aſſembled, the Miniſters having imployed the People
forty days in chuſing Knights and Burgeſſes to be ſent home in
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:56346:48"/>
Right, with a Declaration after them, as if they had been
called together only to be affronted.</p>
            <p>As to the People, if their Knights and Burgeſſes came
back ſooner than they expected, they had reaſon to thank
themſelves,<note place="margin">Pag. 6.</note> who had twice before ſent up the ſame men;
and as you obſerved before, the people do not change ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly,
ſo neither doth the Court, but doth as certainly
ſend back a Parliament, that will not be governed, as the
People ſend them. And the People were overjoyed too,
to ſee them again, for when they went out they had told
them, they never expected to come back again. So that
ſo ſpeedy and ſafe a return was as welcome to them that
ſent them, as could be imagined.</p>
            <p>As for the Knights and Burgeſſes themſelves they had
fair warning given them by his Majeſty before-hand, and
if they would affront either Him, or the Upper Houſe,
they did it at their apperil; and it was well they ſcaped
ſo well, as to be ſent home with a Declaration after
them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Author acknowledgeth that his Majeſty failed not to
give good Advice unto them,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 27.</note> 
               <hi>who were called together to Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe
him.</hi> And ſo many; I might ſay, all our former
Princes have done before his Majeſty; and commanded
them too, not to meddle with ſuch and ſuch things; yea,
and puniſhed private Members ſometimes for doing other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.
The Lord Keeper in the 35 year of Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi>
Reign ſpoke thus to the Commons.</p>
            <q>It is her Majeſties pleaſure,<note place="margin">Proceedings of the four laſt Parl.</note> the time be not ſpent in

things of ſubſtance, the time that is precious would not

be thus ſpent.</q> And in the ſame Parliament, the Lord
Keeper upon the uſual demands by the New Speaker, ſaid
thus:</p>
            <q>

priviledge you have, not to ſpeak every one what he
liſteth, or what cometh in his brain to utter, but your
priviledge is to ſay Yea, or No. Wherefore Mr. Speaker, her
Majeſties pleaſure is, that if you perceive any Idle Heads,
which will not ſtick to hazard their own Eſtates, which
will meddle with Reforming of the Church, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
of the Commonwealth; and do exhibit any
Bills to that purpoſe, that you receive them not,<note place="margin">☜</note> until
they be viewed and conſidered of by thoſe whom it is
fitter ſhould conſider of ſuch things, and can better judge
of them.</p>
               <p>To your perſons all priviledge is granted, with this
Caveat, that under colour of this Priviledge, no mans

deſerved any commendation from my Author, for their
having ſo much reſpect to the King,</hi>

complain of the great invaſion that was made upon their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty

In that very Parliament I have mentioned,<note place="margin">Feb. 24. 1592. 35 Eliz.</note> Mr. <hi>Peter
Wentworth</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry Bromley</hi> delivered a Petition
unto the Lord Keeper, therein deſiring the Lords of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pper
Houſe to be ſuppliants with them of the Lower Houſe unto
her Majeſty, for entailing the Succeſſion to the Crown; whereof
a Bill was already drawn.</p>
            <p>Her Majeſty was highly diſpleaſed therewith, after ſhe
knew it, as a matter contrary to her former ſtreight Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and charged the Council to call the Parties before them.
Sir <hi>Thomas Henage</hi> preſently ſent for them, and after ſpeech
with them, commanded them to forbear coming to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and not to go out from their Lodgings,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The next day,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prerogative of Parliaments, <hi>Pag.</hi> 56.</note> 
               <hi>being Sunday, Mr.</hi> Peter Wentworth <hi>was

Stephens, <hi>and Mr.</hi> Welch, <hi>the other Knight for</hi> Worce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterſhire,
<hi>were ſent to the Fleet.</hi> And Sir <hi>Walter Rauleigh</hi> tells
us, <hi>Wentworth</hi> died in the Tower, tho this Motion was but
ſuppoſed dangerous to the Queens Eſtate.</p>
            <p>Yet here was no expreſs Command againſt it, but only
a general Command which I have recited; neither doth it
appear that any diſheriſon of any right Heir to the Crown
was intended. And in this very Parliament one Mr. <hi>Morris.</hi>
Attourney of the Court of Wards, bringing in a Bill againſt
the abuſes of the Biſhops, as he pretended, <hi>in Lawleſs In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitions,
injurious Subſcriptions, and binding Abſolution;
he was the next day ſent for to Court,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Feb. 28. 1592.</note> 
               <hi>and committed unto
Sir</hi> John Forteſcues <hi>Keeping. And upon both theſe the Queen

            </p>
            <q>It is in me, and my power, to call Parliaments, and
it is in my power to end and determine the ſame; it
is in my power to Aſſent or Diſſent to any thing done in
Parliament.</q>
            <p>The Calling of this Parliament was only that the Majeſty
of God might be more religiouſly ſerved, and thoſe that
neglected this Service might be compelled by ſome ſharper
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:56346:49"/>
means to a more due Obedience,<note place="margin">And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly in this Seſſion of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament was the ſharp Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute made againſt the Diſſenters, which was deſigned to have been repealed, when the Bill of Repeal was loſt in the Houſe of Lords.</note> and a more true ſervice of
God than there hath been hitherto uſed. And further, that
the ſafety of her Majeſties Perſon and of this Realm might be
by all means provided for againſt our great Enemies, the Pope
and the King of <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Her Majeſties moſt excellent pleaſure being then delivered
unto us by the Lord Keeper, it was not meant we ſhould med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
with <hi>Matters of State,</hi> or in Cauſes Eccleſiaſtical; (for
ſo her Majeſty termed them) ſhe wondered that any would be of
ſo high Commandment to attempt (I uſe her own words) a
thing contrary to that which ſhe had ſo expreſly forbidden,
wherefore with this ſhe was highly diſpleaſed.</p>
            <p>And in all her Reign after durſt no man attempt to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
with either of theſe things. Now I have taken the
pains to tranſcribe all this out of the tranſactions of her
Reign rather than of any other, becauſe ſhe was never
accuſed of affecting Arbitrary Government, or Popery,
but was beloved of all her Subjects whilſt ſhe lived, and
her Memory is, and ever will be had in honour by
all Engliſh men, and ſhe ought to be a pattern for all her
Succeſſors.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And now let us hear our modeſt Vindicator.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 27.</note> But every
man muſt be moved to hear it charged upon them as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable
diſobedience, that they did not obſequiouſly ſub mit
to that irregular command of not touching on the buſineſs of the
Succeſſion. Shall two or three unknown Minions take upon
them, like the Lords of the Articles of <hi>Scotland</hi> to preſcribe
unto an Engliſh Parliament what things they ſhall treat
of? Do they intend to have Parliaments, <hi>inter inſtrumenta
ſervitutis,</hi> as the Romans had Kings in our Country? This
would quickly be if what was then attempted had ſucceeded,
and ſhould be ſo purſued hereafter, that Parliaments ſhould
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:56346:50"/>
be directed what they are to meddle with, and threatned if
they do any other thing: For the loſs of Liberty of freedom
of Debate in Parliament, will ſoon and certainly be followed by
a general loſs of Liberty.</p>
            <p>This is the right temper and Spirit of a good Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
man, thus did your Fathers talk in the days of his
Majeſties Father, till Priviledge of Parliament had eat up
all the Prerogatives of the Crown, and the Liberties of the
Subjects, and delivered us over to ſlavery, poverty, and
confuſion, ſo that the Tyrannical, Arbitrary, bloudy Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of <hi>Oliver Cromwel</hi> was thought a bleſſing to the
Nation, in compariſon of theſe Parliamentary Inſtruments
of ſlavery, and their Legions, which I hope this Generation
will ſo well remember as never to ſet it up, or ſuffer it to be
ſet up more in my days.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Author having told us in the next place,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 28.</note> That the
King ought to diveſt himſelf of all private inclinations, and
force his own affections to yield unto the Publick Concernments,
and therefore his Parliaments ought to inform him impartially
of that which tends to the good of thoſe they repreſent, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
regard of perſonal paſſions, and might worthily be blamed
if they did not believe that he would forgo them all for the
ſafety of his People; <hi>Concludes,</hi> That therefore if in it
ſelf it was lawful to propoſe a Bill for Excluding the Duke
of <hi>York</hi> from the Crown, the doing it after ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable
ſignification of his pleaſure would not make it
otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>To which I reply, that Parliaments as Subjects are
more bound to comply with the natural and reaſonable
Affections and Paſſions of their Princes, than Princes are
in the ſame Circumſtances with thoſe of their Subjects.
And that in this caſe his Majeſties own Perſonal ſafety and
intereſt was wrapt up in that of his Brother; for if he
might be Excluded, another might be Depoſed on the ſame
pretence, as <hi>Coleman</hi> ſaid truly enough. And tho it
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:56346:50"/>
ſhould be granted that Parliaments ought to inform
Princes, yet it is certain, they ought not to force them;
they had informed the King in the two former Parliaments
what they thought of this Affair, and his Majeſty had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
their Advice, and in the beginning of this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
at <hi>Oxford</hi> had told them, <hi>That what he had formerly, and
ſo often declared touching the Succeſſion he could not depart
from.</hi> And after all this for them to enter again upon it in
the very firſt place, looked like an intended force: And
then tho the thing were lawful in it ſelf, it may be thought
unreaſonable thus to purſue it; and Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>
would have made them have felt the Effects of her reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for preſuming to be of ſo <hi>high Commandment,</hi> if ſhe
had been in his Majeſties place.</p>
            <p>In the next place we are told his Majeſties unuſual ſtiffneſs
upon this occaſion,<note place="margin">Pag. 28.</note> begins to be ſuſpected not to proceed from
fondneſs to his Brother, much leſs from any thoughts of
danger to the Engliſh Monarchy, by ſuch a Law, but from
the influence of ſome few ill men upon his Royal mind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now let all the World judge betwixt the King and this
Party; they grant the King has been heretofore compliant
enough to their deſires; and then in the rudeſt Language
that ſpight and ſcorn could dictate, conclude, againſt ſenſe
and reaſon, that it was not fondneſs to his Brother, nor
kindneſs to the Monarchy, but the ill influence of a few
men that had thus diſpoſed him. A likely thing, that he
which could give up a Brother, and be ſo unconcerned
for his Crown, ſhould be ſo ſtupid rather than ſtiff as
to venture all for a few ill men.<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>Creatures to the Duke,
and Penſioners to</hi> France, <hi>wicked Wretches who have infected
him with the fatal Notion, that the Intereſts of his People
are not only diſtinct, but oppoſite to his.</hi> No words I can
write are ſharp enough to reprove this Miſcreant, that thus
rails againſt his and my Sovereign the Lords Anointed, and
therefore to God Almighty I leave it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:56346:51"/>
He tells us in the next place, his Majeſty doth not ſeem to
doubt of his Power in Conjunction with his Parliament to
Exclude his Brother. He very well knows this Power hath
been often Exerted in the time of his Predeceſſors.</p>
            <p>Yes, doubtleſs his Majeſty hath read the Engliſh Story,
and obſerved at the ſame time, that more Princes have
been depoſed by Pretended power of Parliament than Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded;
and he very well knows that if he ſhall yield that
an Argument drawn from Example is valid, he will then
ſtand upon ſlippery ground. He alſo knows that the right
Heir was never put by but a good plenty of Miſeries,
Wars, and Calamities followed upon it; and he is able to
foreſee, that if the ſame ſhould happen again, the French
King may eaſily poſſeſs himſelf of theſe miſerable King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
and therefore it is fairly probable love to his People
as well as his Brother hath kept him from conſenting.</p>
            <p>The reaſons he ſaith that his Majeſty hath aliedged are
becauſe it concerned him ſo near in Honour,<note place="margin">Pag. 28.</note> Juſtice, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, not to do it.</p>
            <p>And are not theſe three powerful Arguments? But my
Author can ridicule them, and turn them all againſt the
King. <hi>It is not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>honourable for a Prince to be true
and faithful to his Word and Oath? To keep and maintain
the Religion and Laws Eſtabliſhed?</hi> Yes, who doth queſtion
it, but all this, and all that he hath ſaid beſides, may be
done without Excluding his Brother, who would have
juſt as much right (ſuppoſing the King dies without law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Iſſue) to the Reverſion, as his Majeſty hath to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Poſſeſſion. And can his Majeſty wrong him of that
Right without a blemiſh to his Honour, Juſtice, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience?
Who will ever after dare to relie upon his Majeſty
if they once ſee him deſert his own Brother?</p>
            <p>But that which follows is amazing.<note place="margin">Pag. 29.</note> All Obligations of
Honour, Juſtice, and Conſcience, are comprehended in a grateful

the kindneſs they ſhewed him, when they recalled him from a
miſerable helpleſs Baniſhment, and with ſo much dutiful affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
placed him in the Throne, enlarged his Revenue above what
any of his Predeceſſors had enjoyed, and gave him vaſter Sums
of Money in twenty years, than had been beſtowed upon all the
Kings ſince <hi>William</hi> the Firſt? Should he after all this deliver
them up to be ruined by his Brother?</p>
            <p>It ſhould have been, Should he after all this deliver them

            <p>
               <hi>In the next Paragraph my Author is very Politick, and
tells us,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 30.</note> Our Anceſtors have been always more careful to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the Government inviolable, than to favour any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal
pretences, and have therein conformed themſelves
to the practice of all other Nations, whoſe examples deſeve
to be followed.</p>
            <p>That is, they have been more careful to preſerve the
Mornarchy it ſelf, and the Liberties of the Subject, than
the due and legal Deſcent in the Succeſſion. This is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
true. And they have paid well for neglecting the
other; as is apparent to any body that has read the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
of <hi>England.</hi> I will inſtance only in the Wars betwixt
the Houſes of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> and <hi>York. Richard</hi> II. being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed

Chriſtians, and moſt of them of this Nation. Is it
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:56346:52"/>
fit to run the Riſque of ſuffering all this over
again?</p>
            <p>As to his Examples of Princes that have been Excluded
upon the account of Religion, or for other ſmaller matters,
they prove nothing, but that ill things have been done, but
ought they therefore to be reacted? As for his railing
Accuſations brought againſt his Royal Highneſs, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
ſo much the leſs conſideration becauſe he treats the
King at that abominable rate he doth; of whoſe Clemency,
Juſtice, and Compaſſion all <hi>Europe</hi> are Witneſſes.</p>
            <p>

               <note place="margin">Pag. 31.</note> 
               <hi>he ſaith,</hi> Let it
be under the Authority of Law, let it be againſt a Baniſhed
Excluded Pretender. There is no fear of the Conſequence of
ſuch a War. No true Engliſhman can joyn with him, or counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation; after this Act, and for his Popiſh and
Forein Adherents, they will neither be more provoked, nor more
powerful by the paſſing of it.</p>
            <p>This man all along ſuppoſeth that neither the Duke nor
the King have any natural Hereditary Right to the Crown;
but talketh as if it were meerly at the pleaſure of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
and their Repreſentatives to make what man they
pleaſe King of <hi>England,</hi> ſuppoſing that a Son of an Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
of <hi>Germany,</hi> or of a King of <hi>Poland,</hi> were paſſed by
or Excluded, and ſhould enter a War for the gaining of that
Crown, to which for want of an Election he had never any
legal right, he might be ſtiled a Pretender or an Uſurper;
but in an Hereditary Kingdom it can never be ſo, if according
to the before cited opinion of K. <hi>James,</hi> no Act of Parliament
can extinguiſh the Dukes Right, which God and Nature
hath given him, in caſe the King ſhould die before his Royal
Highneſs without lawful Iſſue, tho it may prevent his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
it. So that he can never be an Uſurper or Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
till the <hi>Monarchy</hi> of <hi>England</hi> is declared to be Elective.
And this may be thought to be one reaſon why his Majeſty
ſhould never yield the point. And as for my Authors
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:56346:53"/>
confidence in the ſucceſs of ſuch a War, it ſpeaks nothing
but his earneſt deſire of one, rather than not to have his
Will, and I hope the Nation will have no occaſion to prove
him a falſe Prophet.<note place="margin">Pag. 31.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Nor will his Excluſion make it at all neceſſary to maintain
a ſtanding Force, for preſerving the Government, and the
peace of the Kingdom. The whole People will be an Army for
that purpoſe, and every heart and hand will be prepared to
maintain that ſo neceſſary, ſo much deſired Law.</p>
            <p>If all this were true, there would be no need of an Army
indeed, but then there would alſo be as little need of an
<hi>Aſſociation</hi> too, for I never heard of a Prince that was
able to compel three whole Nations to ſubmit to him
againſt all their Wills, and without Forein Aids. But, Sir,
the Houſe of Commons thought the latter neceſſary, or elſe
they would never have deſired that his Majeſty would be
likewiſe <hi>Graciouſly pleaſed to Aſſent to an Act whereby his

            <p>As to his Recrimination upon the Miniſters for the two
Armies and the Guards; let him ſet his heart at reſt, for the
World is very well ſatisfied, the one were never intended
to be kept up, and it is hoped the other (the Guards) will
be ever formidable to ſuch Gentlemen, as my Author, who
in kindneſs to the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> Title, and the Bill of

that Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was a Baſtard, though born in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony.

               <hi>In the next Paragraph my Author endeavours to face
his Majeſty down,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 32.</note> That nothing was intended by thoſe other
ways which were darkly and dubiouſly intimated in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
Speech unto the Parliament at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the Declaration; and he ſaith, that his Majeſty in his
wiſdom could not but know that they ſignified nothing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now this is a ſtrange way of proceeding with Princes, and
would anger a private man.</hi> The Regency ſignified nothing,
the diſtinction betwixt the Kings Perſonal and Politick Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
was unfeaſible; the Pope might abſolve him from all
Oaths,<note place="margin">Pag. 33.</note> as he did King <hi>John,</hi> and <hi>Henry III.</hi> and it would be more fatal to us when Religion is concerned, which was not
then in queſtion. His Confeſſor would excite him againſt us,
and he who has made uſe of all the Power he has been intruſted
with hitherto for our deſtruction, <hi>(witneſs his Naval Wars
againſt the Dutch)</hi> would certainly Elude all Methods but
the Bill of Excluſion, and if it were otherwiſe, there was no
hopes of having any fruit of any Expedient without a War;
and to be obliged to ſwear Allegiance to a Popiſh Prince, to own
his Title, to acknowledge him ſupreme Head of the Church,
and Defender of the Faith, ſeems <hi>(ſays my Author)</hi> a ſtrange
way of entitling our ſelves to fight with him.</p>
            <p>It doth ſo; and therefore all thoſe that are reſolved on a
War will I ſuppoſe never do it. But are all theſe Titles
annexed to the Crown as Proteſtant, or as imperial and
ſubject to none but God? Did they belong to <hi>Henry</hi> VIII.
or did they not? And ſuppoſing no Expedient ſhould be
uſed, would not the Number, Conſtancy, and Reſolution
of the Engliſh Nation, and Proteſtants in it, preſerve the
Religion in one Prince's Reign, tho of a different Religion,
without a War?</p>
            <p>The Expedient propounded by his Majeſty. that if
means could be found, <hi>That in caſe of a Popiſh Succeſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:56346:54"/>
his Majeſty to ſubmit to any thing but what will ruine
both him and his Brother, as the Bill of Excluſion, backed
with ſuch an Aſſociation, as was lately found, certainly
will. In ſhort, this Caſe is beſet with ſo many and great
difficulties that it baffles all humane wit and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to provide ſuch an Expedient for it, as may be ſecure
and ſatisfie; and therefore when all is done that can be
done, it muſt be left to God Almighty, who only can, and
will determine it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Having denied the charge in the Declaration,</hi> That there
was reaſon to believe that the Parliament would have paſſed
further to attempt ſome other great and important changes
even at preſent, <hi>and according to his wont, ſchooled the
King; and told the Miniſters,</hi> That they hate Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
becauſe their Crimes are ſuch that they have reaſon to
fear them. <hi>He relents a little, and tells us, if they</hi> (the
Miniſters) <hi>by that expreſſion meant,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 34.</note> That the Parliament
would have beſought the King that the Duke might no longer
have the Government in his hands. <hi>This is a little hard to
be underſtood, the Duke not being then in</hi> England. 2. That
his Dependants <hi>(thoſe that had voted againſt the Bill)</hi>
ſhould no longer preſide in His Councils, no longer poſſeſs all
the great Truſts and Offices in the Kingdom. 3. That our
Ports, our Garriſons, and our Fleets ſhould be no longer go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
by ſuch as are at his devotion. 4. That Characters of
Honour and Favour ſhould be no longer placed on men that the
Wiſdom of the Nation <hi>(the Houſe of Commons without
the Lords, for they have it ſeems lately got a Patent to
Monopolize all the Wiſdom of the Nation)</hi> hath judged
to be favourers of Popery, or Penſioners of <hi>France.</hi> Theſe
are great and important Changes, but ſuch as it becomes
Engliſhmen to believe were deſigned by that Parliament, and
ſuch as will be deſigned and preſt by every Parliament, and ſuch
as the People will ever pray may find ſucceſs with the King;
without theſe Changes <hi>(and the Aſſociation forgotten by my
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:56346:54"/>
Author)</hi> the Bill of Excluſion would only provoke, not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm
our Enemies. Nay, the very money which we muſt have
paid for it, would have been made uſe of to ſecure and haſten
the Duke's return upon us.</p>
            <p>Now this was all perhaps was meant by that
paſſage in the Declaration,<note place="margin">In plain Engliſh there muſt be a <hi>Change,</hi> we muſt neither have Popiſh Wife, nor Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Favourite, nor Popiſh Miſtris, nor Popiſh Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor at Court, nor any new Convert.

               </note> and the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
of theſe things are ſuch that no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching will ever obtain them, till his Majeſty
is weary of all he hath, and therefore it well
becomes all Engliſh men, that do not deſign
another Rebellion, for time to come to deſign,
and pray: and our Parliaments to preſs for ſome
other things that may be fitter for them to ask,
and his Majeſty to grant. I conclude with the Wiſemans
Advice, <hi>My Son fear thou the Lord and the King: and
meddle not with them that are given to change. Eſpecially to
ſuch important changes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are now come to the conſideration of that only fault
which was peculiar to the Parliament at <hi>Oxford,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 35.</note> and that
was their behaviour in relation to the buſineſs of <hi>Fitz-Harris,</hi>
the Declaration ſays, He was impeached of High Treaſon by
the Commons, and they had cauſe to think his Treaſons to be
of ſuch an extraordinary nature, that they well deſerved an
examination in Parliament.</p>
            <p>We ſhall by and by come to examine the reaſons that
made them think ſo, and in the interim it is worth the
while to recite the very words of the Declaration which
are theſe:</p>
            <q>The buſineſs of <hi>Fitz-Harris,</hi> who was impeached by
the Houſe of Commons of High Treaſon, and by the
Houſe of Lords referred to the ordinary courſe of Law,
was on the ſudden carried on to that extremity, by the
Votes which the Commons paſſed on <hi>March</hi> 26. laſt, that
there was no poſſibility left of a Reconciliation.</q>
            <p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:56346:55"/>
The Votes are theſe:</p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Roſolved,</hi> That it is the undoubted Right of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
in Parliament aſſembled, to impeach before the
Lords in Parliament, any Peer or Commoner, for Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
or any other Crime or Miſdemeanor: And that the
refuſal to proceed in Parliament upon ſuch impeachment,
is a denial of Juſtice, and a Violation of the Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Parliaments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſolved,</hi> That in the caſe of <hi>Edward Fitz-Harris,</hi> who
by the Commons hath been impeached of High Treaſon
before the Lords, with a Declaration, that in convenient
time they would bring up the Articles againſt him for the
Lords to Reſolve, that the ſaid <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> ſhould be
proceeded with according to the courſe of Common Law,
and not by way of impeachment at this time, is a denial
of Juſtice, and a violation of the Conſtitutions of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,
and an Obſtruction to the further diſcovery of
the Popiſh Plot, and of great danger to his Majeſties Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and the Proteſtant Religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſolved,</hi> That for any inferiour Court to proceed
againſt <hi>Edward Fitz-Harris,</hi> or any other perſon lying
under an impeachment in Parliament, for the ſame Crimes
he or they ſtand impeached, is a high breach of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
of Parliament.</p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>And now let us follow my Authors account of</hi> Fitz-Harris
<hi>his buſineſs,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 35.</note> who, he ſays truly, was a known Iriſh
Papiſt, and it appeared by the Informations given in the
Houſe, he was made uſe of by ſome very great perſons to ſet
up a Counterfeit Proteſtant Conſpiracy,<note place="margin">Oatos tells us, theſe were the Proteſting Lords, and the Leading men in the Houſe of Commons. <hi>Trial,</hi> pag. 28.</note> and thereby not only to
drown the noiſe of the Popiſh Plot, but to take off the Heads
of the moſt eminent of thoſe who refuſed to bow their knees to
<hi>Baal,</hi> &amp;c. That this might look as unlike a Popiſh Deſign
<hi>(and be the better received by the people)</hi> as was poſſible,
they framed a libel full of the moſt bitter invectives againſt
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:56346:55"/>
Popery and the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> it carried as much ſeeming
zeal for the Proteſtant Religion as <hi>Colemans</hi> Declaration,
and as much care and concern for our Laws, as the pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of this Declaration would ſeem to have: But it
was alſo filled with the moſt ſubtile inſinuations, and the
ſharpeſt expreſſions againſt his Majeſty that could be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented,
and with direct and paſſionate incitements to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion.</p>
            <p>This Paper,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Trial,</hi> pag. 21.</note> as it appears by the account of it which was
given at <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> his Trial, was penn'd in the ſtile, and
juſt like the Libels the ſober Proteſtants daily Print, and
perhaps not much unlike our modeſt Vindicator, in the
main, but had ſome things in it which they whiſper for
the preſent, becauſe it is dangerous Printing of them. And
ſome other things plainly ſpoken, which the other Party
have a way to inſinuate craftily, ſo that it may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,
and yet not hazard their ſweet lives.</p>
            <p>This,<note place="margin">Pag. 35.</note> 
               <hi>ſaith my Author,</hi> was to be conveyed by unknown
Meſſengers (Oates <hi>ſays by the Penny Poſt)</hi> to their hands
who were to be betrayed, and then they were to be ſeized upon,
and thoſe Libels ſound about them, were to be a Confirmation
of the truth of a Rebellion, which they had provided Witneſſes
to ſwear was deſigned by the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and had before
prepared men to believe by Private Whiſpers. And the credit
of this Plot ſhould no doubt have been ſoon confirmed by ſpeedy
Juſtice done upon the pretended Criminals.</p>
            <p>And now it is time to give a little better account of this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,
than perhaps the Author has given, it was penned by one
Mr. <hi>Everard,</hi> by the direction of <hi>Fitz-Harris,</hi> he fearing he
might be ſhamm'd, and that it was deſigned ſo, called in
one Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> and <hi>Sir William Waller</hi> into the buſineſs,
that ſo he might clear himſelf of it, and trappan <hi>Fitz-Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris.</hi>
Theſe two Gentlemen heard <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> dictate the
heads of it to <hi>Everard.</hi> and one of them heard him ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
of it, when it was delivered to him. Mr. <hi>Everard</hi>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:56346:56"/>
was promiſed his reward for all this by the French Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour,<note place="margin">Pag. 24.</note>
as Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> ſwears in the Trial he heard
<hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> ſay; and upon Sir <hi>William Wallers</hi> giving the
King an account of it, <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> was taken with the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel
about him.</p>
            <p>Being taken and committed to <hi>Newgate,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Feb. 27.</note> he was exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the tenth day of <hi>March</hi> by Sir <hi>Robert Clayton,</hi> and
Sir <hi>George Treby,</hi> There he ſpeaks not one word of the
Author of the Libel.<note place="margin">Said <hi>Colledge,</hi> If you do not joyn with <hi>Fitz-Harris,</hi> and charge the King home, you are the baſeſt fellow in the world, <hi>&amp;c. Colledge</hi> Trial. pag. 30.</note> But being thus impriſoned, he found
there was no way to ſave his life, but to curry favour with
thoſe eminent men that had never bowed the knee to <hi>Baal.</hi>
So that Story was ſet up, which he was not able to prove
one Syllable of at his Trial, but however it was eaſily
enough believed by them, who love to make the King
and Court as odious as they can, as well as the Papiſts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Author goes on.</hi> The heinous nature of the Crime,
and the greatneſs of the Perſons ſuppoſed to be concerned,<note place="margin">Pag. 36.</note> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
an extraordinary Examination, which a Jury, who
were only to enquire whether <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> was guilty of framing
that Libel, could never make; and the Commons believed
none but the Parliament was big enough to go through with
it.</p>
            <p>The Trial of this Perſon being extant, I muſt for brevity
refer my Reader to it; and I ſee not how it had been poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for the Parliament to have ſifted that buſineſs of <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi>
his being put upon this by the Court, to ruine the
eminent men, more narrowly than it was at the Trial, and
there was not one ſyllable proved by any of the Witneſſes
he produced, which were many, and perſons of great
worth, only Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> ſaid, he heard <hi>Everard</hi> ſay ſome ſuch
thing, which <hi>Everard</hi> again denied upon his Oath. And
Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> owned he had heard the King was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented
at his troubling him with this buſineſs; but
Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Everard</hi> proved it
poſitively upon him that he had ordered the drawing of
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:56346:56"/>
that Libel, had approved of it when it was drawn, and
amended ſome words in it with his own hands. And now
after all this to lay the Crime upon the Court, upon the
ſuggeſtion of the Malefactor, was ſuch a piece of Juſtice as
never was attempted.</p>
            <p>Nor did they <hi>(the Commons)</hi> only fear the perverſion of
Juſtice,<note place="margin">Pag. 36.</note> but the miſapplication of Mercy too, &amp;c. becauſe when
<hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> was inclined to Repentance, and had begun a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
to the ſurprize of the whole Nation, without any viſible
cauſe, he was taken out of the lawful cuſtody of the Sheriffs, and
ſhut up a cloſe priſoner in the Tower.</p>
            <p>That he had not only begun, but gone through with a
Confeſſion appears by a Printed Narrative, taken by two,
which I think were both of the Houſe of Commons, one I am
ſure was. And when notwithſtanding this, ſome eminent
men began to tamper with him to turn all this upon the
Court; then, and not before, was he taken out of the cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of the Sheriffs, and put into the Tower, that they might
not make an ill uſe of him to the Damage of the King and
the Government.</p>
            <p>The Commons had therefore no other way to be ſecure that
the proſecution ſhould be effectual,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> the Judgment indifferent,
and the Criminal out of all hopes of Pardon, (unleſs by
an ingenuous Confeſſion be could engage both Houſes in a
powerful mediation to his Majeſty in his behalf.) But by
impeaching him they were ſure no pardon could ſtop their
ſuit, tho the King might releaſe his own Proſecution by his
Pardon.</p>
            <p>What need there was here of any further or more inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous
Confeſſion that he ſhould make, than what he had
made I cannot imagine; but we may gueſs it was meant,
that if <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> ſhould lay the blame of this Libel on
the Court, and ſay it was deſigned to Trappan the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
men, then they would try to get him pardoned, but if
he did not do this, then he ſhould have been hanged without
mercy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:56346:57"/>
Well, But what if the King would not have conſented to
the Pardon, which was to have been purchaſed with his
diſhonour? Then the Commons would not have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
with their impeachment, and the Conſequence would
have been (if the Lords had not rejected the Impeachment)
that then no inferiour Court could have tried him, and ſo he
ſhould never have been tried.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>So that it is plain, that if the Lords had not rejected this
Impeachment,</hi> it would, <hi>as the King ſaith in the Declaration,</hi>
have been made uſe of to delay a Trial that We had directed
againſt a profeſs'd Papiſt charged with Treaſons againſt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s
of an extraordinary nature: And certainly the Houſe of
Peers did themſelves Right in refuſing to give countenance to
ſuch a proceeding.</p>
            <p>Part of the 36,<note place="margin">Pag. 36, 37, 38, 39.</note> and all the 37, 38, 39, Pages are ſpent by
my Author to prove that a Commoner may be tried by the
Peers in Parliament upon an Impeachment of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons;
in which matter I will have no Controverſie with
him becauſe he may be in the right for ought I know. And
I have as little to ſay to him,<note place="margin">Pag. 40.</note> whether ſuch Commoners as
are tried there ought to have any Juries, or whether the
Lords rejecting the Impeachment was, or only looked, like
a denial of Juſtice. For it is plain, that as good juſtice
might be had, and in this caſe was had, in the Kings Bench
as could have been had before the Lords, and if <hi>Fitz-Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi>
had been acquitted there, then the Commons might
afterwards have impeached him of any branch of Treaſon
that was not; or could not have been tried in the Kings
Bench; ſo that the pretence he makes that part of his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
were thought ſuch as could only be adjudged in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
is impertinent, for the remainder were apparently ſuch
as he ought to be hanged for, in an inferiour Court, and he
could ſuffer but once, and the taking notice of the reſt would
have been impertinent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:56346:57"/>
I think I may modeſtly ſay this, that the impeachment
of Commoners before the Lords is ſo extraordinary a way,
that it would be uſed as little as is poſſible; but theſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
were for nothing elſe, and <hi>Thompſon, Sheridon, Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
and the Lord knows how many more, were to have been
thus proceeded againſt, tho they were not perſons of ſuch
extraordinary degree or quality, but they might full as well
have been tried in any other Court, and the Conſequence
of this would have been, that neither the Lords nor Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
would have had any leiſure for any thing elſe but this.</p>
            <p>Might it not be well retorted by the People,<note place="margin">Pag. 41.</note> that it had been
long a matter extremely ſenſible to them, that ſo many Proro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,
ſo many Diſſolutions, ſo many other Arts had been uſed
to delay the Trials, which his Majeſty had often deſired and
the Parliament prepared for, againſt the five profeſſed Popiſh
Lords charged with Treaſons of an extraordinary nature.</p>
            <p>The King might if he had pleaſed have charged this up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Commons too, that notwithſtanding the long time
they had been impriſoned, yet the Commons would not go
on with their Trials, that they might legally and regularly
be diſcharged. The Impeachment of the Earl of <hi>Danby</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they had tried theſe five Lords occaſioned the diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Long Loyal Parliament. A Controverſie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Lords and the Commons about the Trial of the
ſaid Earl of <hi>Danby</hi> broke the next Parliament. Then
comes the ſecond ſhort <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Parliament, and having
tried only one of them, the Earl of <hi>Stafford,</hi> when all the
World were in expectation they would have gone on, and
have tried the other four, they fell upon the Excluſion Bill,
and that being rejected by the Lords, they fell upon the
Revenue, and ſeemingly Voted the King a<note n="*" place="margin">

ſeveral eminent men of the Privy Counſellors were favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers

comes that at <hi>Oxford,</hi> with the Votes I have recited, for
which, and for inſiſting upon the Bill for Excluding the
Duke of <hi>York</hi> they were diſſolved. Could none of theſe
Parliaments have tried the Popiſh Lords without theſe
things? Yes, doubtleſs they might, but they would not,
but kept theſe Lords in the Tower, that whatever provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
they ſhould give the King to Diſſolve or Prorogue
them, ſtill the clamour might be that it was to prevent
their Trials. And I am fully perſuaded there are ſome

            <p>But yet however if their Impeachment had not been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,

            <p>But this Trial occaſioned ſtrange talk in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>
Hall, and Queſtions were raiſed of a ſtrange nature that
will never have a determination in any inferiour Court, but
will <hi>aſſuredly at one time or other have a further Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 41.</note>
Theſe queſtions were moved then by <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> his
Counſel, and need never be determined.</p>
            <p>By the Term in the Declaration of the Lords having
done themſelves right by refuſing to admit the Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">Pag. 42.</note>
he hath diſcovered the Penman of the Declaration,
and ſays, he has done himſelf and the Nation Right, and
diſcovered himſelf by uſing his ordinary Phraſe upon this
occaſion. Now I thought verily the next word would have
been his Name; no, but ſtay you there. <hi>The Perſon is well
known without naming him, who always tells men they have
done themſelves no right, when he is reſolved to do them none.</hi>
Now cannot I tell any more whom he means, by this private
token than the man in the Moon, and if he had graciouſly
vouchſafed to have whiſpered his name in my Ear, and I
had known that he had uſually thus expreſſed himſelf,
yet I ſhould ſtill be a little jealous ſome Frenchman or
other might be the Author of it, becauſe my Author
hath given full as good evidence, Page 5. to prove it was
ſo.</p>
            <p>As for the Commons nothing <hi>(ſays my Author)</hi> was
carried on to extremity by them,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> nothing done but what was
Parliamentary, they could not deſire a Conference till they had
firſt ſtated their own Caſe, and aſſerted by Votes the matter
which they were to maintain at a Conference.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This was done effectually in the firſt part of the firſt and
ſecond Vote, without adding,</hi> That the refuſal of the Lords
to proceed in Parliament upon ſuch Impeachment, is a denial
of Juſtice, and a violation of the Conſtitution of Parliaments,
and in the ſecond Vote, and an obſtruction to the further
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:56346:59"/>
diſcovery of the Popiſh Plot, and of great danger to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
Perſon, and the Proteſtant Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Here the Declaration lays the ſtreſs of the buſineſs, and
ſays,</hi> That when either of the Houſes are ſo far tranſported
as to paſs ſuch Votes concerning the proceedings of the other,
without Conferences firſt had to examine upon what grounds
ſuch proceedings are made, and how far they might be juſtified;
this puts the Two Houſes out of a Capacity of Tranſacting
buſineſs together, and conſequently is the greateſt violation
of the Conſtitution of Parliaments. <hi>Now ſurely the Houſe
of Commons might have aſſerted their Right without theſe
Expreſſions, which muſt needs inſenſe the Lords, eſpecially
when they were Printed, and ſpread over the whole
Nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Houſe of Commons was ſo far from thinking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to be out of a Capacity of Tranſacting with the Lords
any further that they were preparing to ſend a Meſſage for a
Conference to Accommodate this difference,<note place="margin">Pag. 42.</note> at the very inſtant
when the Black Rod called them to their diſſolution.</p>
            <p>But this it is very probable was not known to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,
ſo that it came too late to ſave them.</p>
            <p>If every difference in Opinion and Vote ſhould put the Two
Houſes out of a Capacity of tranſacting buſineſs together, every
Parliament muſt be diſſolved as ſoon as called.</p>
            <p>Now, Sir, I could never have thought that it is ſo uſual
a thing for the Two Houſes to make ſuch Votes as theſe
againſt each other; I am perſuaded the Lords would never
have treated with the Commons if a Conference had been
demanded till the Concluſions of the firſt and ſecond Vote
had been recanted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the Miniſters promoted this difference between the Two
Houſes,</hi> (what, did any of them dictate theſe Votes?) <hi>and
then broke the Parliament leſt it ſhould be compoſed.</hi> And
for this my Author gives you his own honeſt word over
again in the next Page, and hopes no man will be ſo hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted
as not to believe him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:56346:59"/>
               <hi>But my Author hath another quarrel againſt the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
becauſe they cenſure theſe Votes of the Commons as
the greateſt violation of the Conſtitution of Parliaments;</hi>
They ought certainly <hi>(ſays my Author)</hi> to have excepted
the power which is here aſſumed of giving ſuch a Judgment,<note place="margin">Pag. 43.</note> and
Publiſhing ſuch a charge, as being not only the higheſt violati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Conſtitution, but directly tending to the deſtruction
of it.</p>
            <p>Well then, I for my part will never undertake to defend
them in it. Aut I have obſerved one thing in theſe debates,
that the Priviledges of the Houſe of Commons are not
much unlike the Power claimed by the Pope, which is to
judge all men, and to be judged by no man. So that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they are pleaſed to call Priviledge of Parliament I am
bound to believe is ſo, with an implicit faith: For theſe
Priviledges of Parliament are known to none but thoſe
that ſit in St. <hi>Stephens</hi> Chappel, and if a man ſit there
twenty years, yet he ſhall be allowed to know no more
of them the day after he is turned out than I do.</p>
            <p>The Declaration mentions one ſort of men who are fond of
their old beloved Commonwealth Principles,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> and others are
aangry at being diſappointed in deſigns they had to accompliſh
their own ambition and greatneſs. Surely <hi>(ſays my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor)</hi>
if they know any ſuch perſons, the only way to have
prevented the miſchiefs which they pretend to fear from them,
had been to have diſcovered them, and ſuffered the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to ſit to provide againſt the evils they would bring upon
the Nation, by proſecuting them.</p>
            <p>I cannot but fancy my Author ſmiled to himſelf when he
made this pleaſant Propoſition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the next place my Author gives us a deſcription of
men of Commonwealth Principles; he tells us,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> They are
men Paſſionately devoted to the publick good, and to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
ſervice of their Country, who believe that Kings were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted
for the good of the People, and Government ordained
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:56346:60"/>
for the ſake of thoſe that are to be governed, and therefore
complain or grieve when it is uſed to contrary ends, and that
wiſe and honeſt men will be proud to be ranked in this
number.</p>
            <p>Now, as favourably as he hath drawn it, I aſſure him, I
for my part am none of the number; for tho I know that
if there were no People, there could hardly have been
Kings, and that one main end of Government was the good
of thoſe that are to be governed; yet I believe that God
Almighty had ſome reſpect for Princes and Governours, and
did not deſign only the good of the People, but their good
too; and tho I can grieve, yet I am not apt to complain when
things go amiſs.</p>
            <p>My Author in the next place ſpends a great deal of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to prove, <hi>That the word Commonwealth ſignifies the
common good, in which ſenſe it hath been uſed by all good
Authors,</hi> &amp;c. Now, this I will yield him, with all my
hearts, that till one thouſand ſix hundred and forty all the
World thought that a good Commonwealth man and a good
Subject were terms that might be promiſcuouſly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently
uſed; but the Author cannot be ignorant, that
not long after the word <hi>Commonwealth</hi> was ſo wholly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated
to an odious <hi>Democracy</hi> by the Rebels of the
late times, whoſe uſurped Seal and Coyn bore the Image
and Superſcription of the Beaſt, that it is no ways likely it
ſhould ever recover its Primitive ſignification.</p>
            <p>And I dare aſſure him, that many of the Engliſh Nation
will never be pleaſed to find in Parliament ſuch men as
have ſo great a kindneſs for the word, as implies a han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kering
after the thing it has obtained to ſignifie.</p>
            <p>But if the Declaration <hi>(ſays my Vindicator)</hi> would inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
that there had been any deſign of ſetting up a Democrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Government,<note place="margin">Pag. 44.</note> in oppoſition to our Legal Monarchy, it is a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny
juſt of a piece with the other thing which the Penners
of the Declaration have vented, in order to the laying upon
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:56346:60"/>
others the blame of a deſign to overthrow the Government,
which only belongs to themſelves.</p>
            <p>Now,<note place="margin">There hath not been a Week (ſince <hi>Venners</hi> riſing) in which there have not been Combinations and Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies formed againſt his Majeſties Perſon, and againſt the Peace of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, <hi>&amp;c. Lord Chancellors Speech,</hi> May 8. 1661.</note> Sir, This is not the firſt time that his
Majeſty hath complained of a parcel of men
who had ſuch a deſign; and if you pleaſe we
will inquire a little into the reaſon of it. That
there was in the Nation a great number of men
that had imbibed a Notion, that all other kinds
of Governments but what had ſomething of the
Democratical form in them without a ſingle
Perſon, were Arbitrary and Tyrannical, I ſuppoſe will
not be denied, that theſe men did not all of them expire
when his Majeſty landed from <hi>Breda</hi> is very probable, but
his Majeſty being ſetled, and all things running quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to their Intereſt, as you have told us, may appear
by comparing the Parliaments that were ſent up in 1640.<note place="margin">Pag. 6.</note>
and 1660. theſe men were forced to ſeem more loyal
than they were, that they might one day appear what they
were.</p>
            <p>Now, Sir, it is not to be expected they ſhould openly
declare for the Commonwealth of <hi>England,</hi> and deſire
<hi>Charles Stuart</hi> to march off, and give them their right, when
bleſſed be God they have neither Men nor Money to back
ſuch an inſolence with, but yet we may be allowed to
gueſs at their Deſigns by their Actions, and if that may be
allowed, the Penners of the Declaration were not the only
men that thought there was then, and is now, ſome De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocratical
or Commonwealth deſigns againſt the very
Monarchy driving on, and you muſt excuſe me if I ſay
the Calumny lies at your doors, get rid of it as well as you
can.</p>
            <p>It is ſtrange how this word ſhould ſo change its ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
with us in twenty years.<note place="margin">Pag. 44.</note> 
               <hi>All Monarchies in the
world that are not purely Barbarous and Tyrannical have ever
been called Commonwealths,</hi> &amp;c. Sir, I will grant more than
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:56346:61"/>
that, that all without exception have by ſome men been
ſo ſtiled, and produced good Authors for it. But yet we
that had ſo lately like to have been ruined by the word,
and men that were fond of it, ſhall ever have reaſon to hate
them and it,<note place="margin">Tacitus <hi>in the end of the Reign of</hi> Auguſtus <hi>ſaith,</hi> Senes plerique inter Bella Civium na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti, quotuſquiſque reliqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſuch as paſſed betwixt 40. and 60. might be

ſtrict propriety ſignifies the <hi>Publick Affairs of a
People managed by many with equal Authority.</hi>
I could eaſily anſwer all you have brought to
defend the word, but the caſe being plain, I will
not trouble my ſelf or my Reader; and therefore
<hi>if you have no other Argument to prove men
guilty of a fondneſs to Arbitrary Power than
their averſion for this word, I ſhall never go about to contend
with you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No man can have a greater Veneration for Parliaments
than I have, but then who are they that have diſordered
things to that height they lately were? You ſay the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
are the men, whom you repreſent as you uſe to do,
with bitter reflections on his Majeſty, and not the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
others ſay, it was ſuch men as your ſelf; and the caſe
hath been by both Parties referred to the People, and they
have by thouſands given their Verdicts againſt thoſe their
Repreſentatives, which to me is a ſtrong Argument the caſe
is not ſo difficult as you pretend, for I do not conceive it
poſſible to delude <hi>(ſo great a part of the)</hi> People into an
abhorrence of their own Repreſentatives,<note place="margin">Pag. 45.</note> without their
having given them juſt cauſe.</p>
            <p>And if we look about us, we ſhall find theſe who deſign a
change, on either hand fomenting a miſunderſtanding between
the King his Parliament and People, whilſt perſons who love
the Legal Monarchy both out of Choice and Conſcience, are they
who deſire the frequent and ſucceſsful meetings of the great
Council of the Nation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:56346:61"/>
Sir, if you durſt have ſpoken your mind plainly, I might
poſſibly have thought this the only honeſt paſſage in this
whole Book; but as it now ſtands it is to me apparent that
you would not let your Conſcience in this paſſage give your
Paſſion in all the reſt the lie.</p>
            <p>Now, if I might interpret your meaning I ſhould gueſs
it to be this, They that on the one hand pretend to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the Legal Monarchy, but do really intend to advance
it into an abſolute form, without any dependence upon
Parliaments, and they who pretend the ſame thing, but
deſign to throw off the Monarchy, and put the whole
Power into the hands of the People, <hi>i. e. the Commonwealth
Party,</hi> are the men that have brought things into the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
they are now in. <hi>Whilſt they who love the Legal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy
both out of Choice and Conſcience,</hi> (amongſt which
perſons I will ſubſcribe my name when occaſion requires,)
<hi>are they who deſire the frequent and ſucceſsful meetings of the
Great Coucil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, Sir, here ſeems to be a little Juſtice in this, for as
it were a high and flagrant piece of injuſtice to ſay that all
that made up the Houſe of Commons in the two laſt Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
deſigned to ruine the Monarchy, and ſet up another
Parliamentary Commonwealth of <hi>England:</hi> So it is the
ſame notorious and baſe injuſtice in you to traduce the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
in general, as you do throughout the whole Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet,
when as it is apparent enough, firſt, That his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
never did intend to ſet up one Dram of Arbitrary Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
Secondly,<note place="margin">See the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to the firſt part of the Addre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s to the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> That it is not poſſible for the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
to do it without his conſent. Thirdly, That it is
ſcarce poſſible for him and them to do it, if they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
to do it, till there hath been another War. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
That never any conſiderable perſon, or number of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
amongſt the Miniſters, did ever yet make one ſtep to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
it. For all thoſe Acts that have been ſo baſely tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
are fairly defenſible. Thoſe that look worſt, the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:56346:62"/>
Tranſactions about 1671. and 72. not excepted, one of
which you your ſelf have excuſed,<note place="margin">Pag. 19.</note> 
               <hi>viz.</hi> the Poſtponing of
all Payments to the Bankers out of the Exchequer: And
the Declaration for Liberty of Conſcience, though you
ſtile it <hi>an Arbitrary Power aſſumed to ſuſpend Penal Laws,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 22.</note>
               <hi>and ſay the whole Nation was juſtly alarmed upon it;</hi> yet I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
ſhould his Majeſty do the ſame thing over again, thoſe
that now make the greateſt noiſe againſt Arbitrary Power
without cauſe, would willingly enough accept of it. And
yet there is no reaſon that the preſent Miniſters ſhould bear
the blame of theſe things, when they that promoted them
are now, Sir, in your Intereſts.</p>
            <p>And, Sir, that the meetings of the Great Council may
be ſucceſsful as well as frequent, one of theſe things muſt be,
that either the People change the Members of the Lower
Houſe; or that thoſe Members change their Methods of
Proceeding; and till this be done theſe meetings, how fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
ſoever, can never be ſucceſsful. For if things be
carried in the next Convention as they were in the late
Parliaments, neither can the King, neither will the Nation
endure it; and for all our Threats you will find, when you
come to bring it into Act, ſuch difficulties as I car not to
foretel, tho I can foreſee them.</p>
            <p>As for the other ſort of Peeviſh men,<note place="margin">Pag. 45.</note> of whom the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
gives us warning, who are angry at the diſappointment
of their Ambitious Deſigns. If theſe words are intended to
reflect on thoſe men of Honour and Conſcience, who being qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified
for the higheſt imployments of State, have either left,
or refuſed, or be removed from them becauſe they would not
accept ro retain them at the Price of ſelling their Country,
and inſlaving Poſterity: and who are content to ſacrifice their
Safety as well as their Intereſt for the Publick; and expoſe
themſelves to the malice of the men in power, and to the daily
Plots, Perjuries, and Subornations of the Papiſts. I ſay,
if theſe are the Ambitious Men ſpoken of, the People will have
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:56346:62"/>
conſideration for what they ſay, and therefore it will be wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to give ſuch men as theſe no occaſion to ſay they intend to
<hi>lay aſide the uſe of Parliaments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This your Appeal to the People hath ſpoiled all the fine
things you had ſaid before, for ſuppoſing all the reſt had
been true (as it is notoriouſly falſe) yet this making the
People the Judges is a kind of attempt to ſeparate them
from their Governours, and exaſperate them againſt the
Government, from whence muſt ſpring as great inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences
as thoſe you pretend to avoid; and therefore had I
been one of theſe men, I would never have appealed to
them; but to God and my own Conſcience, and have ſate
ſtill till he had pronounced the Sentence in this World, or
that which is to come. You know, Sir, the People are
not able to examine any thing, but being once put into a
rage by ſuch ſpecious Harangues as theſe are, ruſh into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
and confuſion, and take all that endeavour to quiet
them for Enemies and Papiſts, and ſo the guilty eſcape, and
then innocent are cut in pieces. And beſides all this, never
was any diſorder in a Government rectified by the People,
but by a greater and more fatal diſorder, as we had experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in the late times, and very often before.</p>
            <p>But let the Event be what it will, you are reſolved to
ſtir up the People to the utmoſt to revenge your caſe upon
the Government; and to that purpoſe inſinuate there is a
deſign to lay aſide the uſe of Parliaments: as if you ſhould
have ſaid, Stand to your Arms, Gentlemen, againſt theſe
Miniſters, for as they have laid us aſide, <hi>men of Honour
and Conſcience, becauſe we would not ſell our Country, and
enſlave Poſterity;</hi> ſo the next thing to be done is the laying
aſide Parliaments, and you are the men that muſt by your
conſideration of us prevent this great miſchief.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This was pretty well,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 46.</note> 
               <hi>but the next is excellent.</hi> In good
earneſt, the behaviour of the Miniſters of late gives but too
juſt occaſions to ſay, that the uſe of Parliaments is already laid
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:56346:63"/>
aſide; for tho the King has own'd in ſo many of his Speeches
and Declarations the great Danger of the Kingdom, and the
neceſſity of the aid and counſel of Parliaments, he hath never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
been prevailed upon to diſſolve four in the ſpace of twenty
ſix months without making proviſion by their Advice ſuitable
to our dangers or wants.</p>
            <p>My Author was ſenſible that the People might think
that the former hint proceeded from Paſſion, or was not
ſerious, or at leaſt the danger was not eminent; and he comes
now nearer to them, and tells them in <hi>good earneſt</hi> they
had but too juſt occaſions to ſay that Parliaments were
already laid aſide as to any uſe of them; and he proved it
too: Four had been diſſolved in twenty ſix months; but
three of them were called in that time. And this is an odd
ſort of laying them aſide to call as many in twenty ſix
months as heretofore have been called in ſo many years<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Well, but there was <hi>no proviſion made by their Advice ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to our Dangers or Wants.</hi> The fault, ſays the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
was in them,<note place="margin">Declaration.</note> 
               <hi>The King was willing to have done any
thing which would have conſiſted with the very being of the
Government.</hi> He paſſed every Bill that was tendred; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nived
ſo long at the proceedings of the laſt Parliament of
<hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> that many men wondred, and ſome (that were
neither Papiſts, nor Malefactors) murmured. And a grave
man told the very Parliament, that he ſuſpected they were
<hi>permitted to ſit there,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Debates, p. 19 1.</note> 
               <hi>rather to deſtroy themſelves than to
ſave their Country.</hi> And now after all this is his Majeſty
to bear the blame that <hi>no proviſion was made by their Advice
ſuitable to our wants and dangers.</hi> Well, but the People,
to whom my Gentleman is appealing, they will never un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtand
nor conſider theſe things, nor any thing elſe, and
therefore my Gentleman did wiſely to make them the
Judges, but for the honeſty of it, or the truth of any of
this I have nothing to ſay.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:56346:63"/>
Nor can we hope the Court will ever love any Parliament
better than the firſt of thoſe four,<note place="margin">Pag. 46.</note> wherein they had ſo dearly
purchaſed ſuch a number of faſt friends, men who having firſt
ſold themſelves, would not ſtick to ſell any thing after. And
we may well ſuſpect they mean very ill at Court, when their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns

one of theſe things muſt be falſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that there was ſuch a

had ſold themſelves, why did they not go on with the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain?
If the Court had ſuch an intereſt in them, and ſuch
deſigns upon them and us, why did it part with them?
<hi>Eſpecially when the Miniſters knew they loſt thereby a conſtant

and what was doing.</hi> And therefore they were pack'd away.
Well, the matter was not great, they were a company of
<hi>Penſioners, men that had ſold themſelves, and would not ſtick
to ſell any thing after.</hi> And, Sir, if it were ſo, the Nation
has no reaſon to complain of the Court for that, and I hope
I too ſhall be excuſed if I have dropt a few leſs reſpective
words of the three Parliaments that have ſince followed;
for they are not better, nor more ſacred than this, of which
many of the Lord Chancellors have given high Encomiums,

            <p>Now let my Reader reflect on all this ſeriouſly, and tell
me if any perſon, even <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> himſelf, could poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
write <hi>any thing worſe than this; and which tended more

rightly ſtiles them, for none but ſuch would ever
deſire to ſee their Country imbroyled, and to that end ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
to the People. And ſuppoſing the People to be well
diſpoſed that way,<note place="margin">Pag<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6.</note> 
               <hi>it would be no wonder that the Miniſters
dare not ſuffer a Parliament now to ſit,</hi> till the People
are in a better temper to chuſe one; but then, Sir, this is
owing to ſuch men as you, and ſuch Books as yours, and
you muſt anſwer for it.</p>
            <p>But we have gained at leaſt this one point by the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note>
that it is own'd to us, That Parliaments are the beſt Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
for healding the diſtempers of the Kingdom, and the only
means to preſerve the Monarchy in Credit both at home and
abroad. Own'd by theſe very men who have ſo maliciouſly ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
many former Parliaments ineffectual, and by this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
have done their utmoſt to make thoſe which are to
come as fruitleſs, and thereby have confeſſed that they have
no concern for <hi>healing the diſtempers of the Kingdom, and
preſerving the credit of the Monarchy,</hi> which is in effect to
acknowledge themſelves to be what the Commons called them,
<hi>Enemies to the King and Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Juſt before, Sir, you had been proving them deſigning to
lay all uſe of Parliaments aſide, and now you bring them
in owning what will certainly ruine that deſign; not long
before that you had been convicting them of a deſign of
making the Monarchy Arbitrary and abſolute, and now
they are unconcerned for the very Credit of the Monarchy.
Are you in your right Wits? Do you think thus to prove
them Enemies to the King and Kingdom? Why muſt thoſe
Parliaments that are to come be as fruitleſs as thoſe that
are paſt? The Miniſters may be changed, or the People
may change, or the very Parliament men may change; and
time may be Gods grace have ſtrange effects. And in the
mean time his Majeſty is not in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

               </gap> than a bad one,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:56346:64"/>
a Rending inſtead of a Healing Parliament. And in the
interim his Majeſties good Subjects can rely as ſocurely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Royal Declaration that he intends not to lay aſide the
uſe of Parliaments, as if there were one now actually ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
at <hi>Weſtminiſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However we rejoyce,<note place="margin">Pag. 47.</note> that his Majeſty ſeems reſolved to
have frequent Parliaments, and hope he will be juſt to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
and us, by continuing conſtant to this Reſolution. Yet we
cannot but doubt in ſome degree when we remember the Speech
made <hi>January</hi> 26. 1679. to both Houſes, wherein he told
them, that he was <hi>unalterably of an Opinion, that long in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals
of Parliaments were abſolutely neceſſary for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
and quieting the minds of the People.</hi> Therefore
which we ought rather to believe the Speech or the Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or which is likely to laſt longeſt, a <hi>Reſolution,</hi> or an <hi>unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable
Opinion,</hi> is a matter too nice for any but Court Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
to decide. The effectual performance of the laſt part of
the promiſe will give us aſſurance of the firſt.</p>
            <p>When, or where this Speech was ſpoken by his Majeſty
I cannot deviſe, for at the time aſſigned there could be
none. The firſt ſhort Parliament was Prorogued <hi>May</hi> 27.
1679. And the ſecond met not till <hi>October</hi> 21. 1680. and
was Prorogued the tenth of <hi>January</hi> following. I have read
over all his Majeſties Speeches too about that time, and I
find not one tittle in them to this purpoſe.</p>
            <p>But if there ever were any ſuch Speech ſpoken (for I will
not be poſitive there was not) it is fairly reconcileable
with the very words of the Declaration, for the Statute
made in his Majeſties Reign calls Triennial Parliaments,<note place="margin">17 Car. 2. C. 1.</note> 
               <hi>A
frequent calling, aſſembling and holding of Parliaments,</hi> which
yet is a very long Interval in compariſon of the time his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty

            <p>When we ſee the real fruits of theſe utmoſt endeavours to
extirpate Popery out of Parliament;<note place="margin">Pag. 47.</note> when we ſee the Duke of

Laws is no longer a Crime at Court, no longer a fore-runner of
being diſgraced and removed from all Offices and Imployments
in their Power.</p>
            <p>That is, when the Duke of <hi>York</hi> is ruined, and not only
his Popiſh, but his Church of <hi>England</hi> Creatures, who

            <p>That is, when men may ſafely pretend ſo much reſpect
to the Laws, that they may affront his Majeſty who is the
Fountain of all Laws, and the Protector of them, and us

            <p>But whilſt there are ſo many little Emiſſaries imployed to
ſow and encreaſe diviſions in the Nation,<note place="margin">Pag. 48.</note> as if the Miniſters
had a mind to make his Majeſty head of a Faction, and joyn
himſelf to one Party in the Kingdom, who has a juſt right of
Governing all, (which <hi>Thuanus lib.</hi> 28. ſays was the notorious
Folly, and occaſioned the deſtruction of his great-Grandmother
<hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>Scots)</hi> whilſt we ſee the ſame differences
Promoted induſtriouſly by the Court, which gave the Riſe and
Progreſs to the late troubles, and which were once thought fit to
be buried in an Act of Oblivion.</p>
            <p>What is meant by the little Emiſſaries here I know not,
nor will I gueſs. Nor did I ever obſerve the Miniſters had
a mind to make his Majeſty the Head of a Faction, which
your Author much blames in <hi>Henry</hi> III. of <hi>France</hi> too,
when he ſuffered the Holy League, the Prototype of the
Aſſociation, to be ſet afoot, and propagated ſo far before
he took notice of it, that he was forced at laſt to attempt to
make himſelf the Head of it, which was properly a Faction
combined by an Oath againſt the Right Heir to the
Crown, and a part of the Natural Subjects of <hi>France;</hi> on
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:56346:66"/>
pretence of Religion for the Excluſion of the firſt, and
deſtruction of the latter, without, and againſt the conſent
of the King; which cauſed a Rebellion in <hi>France,</hi> the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of the King, a ſooner Succeſſion of <hi>Henry</hi> IV. the
right Heir, (upon changing his Religion) and if God had
not prevented it, had betrayed <hi>France</hi> into the hands of the
Spaniards, or Cantoned it into ſmall Principalities. Now,
this is properly to make a Prince the head of a Faction
without conſideration of the Riſe of our late Troubles;
which ſprung from ſuch another League, but to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
a Loyal Party more than a Rebellious one is not ſo,
and whatever effect it had in the Reign of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> his
Majeſties Grandmother, ſeems the only way now to ſave
<hi>England,</hi> and prevent the need of another Act of Oblivion
and Indemnity for all thoſe Crimes that were pardoned
by his Majeſty, but never repented of by them that acted
them.</p>
            <p>Whilſt we ſee then the Popiſh Intereſt ſo plainly countenanced,<note place="margin">Pag. 48.</note>
which was then done with caution, when every pretence of
Prerogative is ſtrained to the utmoſt height, when Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are uſed with contempt and indignity, and their Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature,
and all their higheſt Priviledges brought in queſtion
in inferious Courts, we have but too good reaſon to believe tho
every Loyal and good man does, yet the Miniſters and Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites
do but <hi>little conſider the Riſe and Progreſs of the late
troubles, and have little deſire or care to preſerve their
Country from a relapſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All this is Party-per-pale a juſtification of the laſt,
and an Exhortation to another Rebellion, upon the ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame
falſe pretences only a little aggravated, becauſe the
People are more ſlow to a new Rebellion than they were to
the laſt.</p>
            <p>And who <hi>(the Miniſters)</hi> as they never yet ſhewed regard

yet ſafe to attack the Maſter, he takes care to
repreſent all his Servants as Knaves and Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
French Penſioners, and Popiſhly affected,
for he knows that if the People can once gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
be brought to think the Court a Den of
Thieves, the Maſter of the Family, that chuſeth and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployeth
them, muſt anſwer for their miſdemeanors, as well

            <p>Next the Miniſters,<note place="margin">Judges and Magiſtrates.</note> his great care is to inſtil into the
People a great averſion for the Loyal Judges and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates,
but if they warp a little, then he admires them for
men, and lovers of the Liberty of the People.</p>
            <p>But that which,<note place="margin">Gentry.</note> next Hanging, is moſt dreadful to him
are the Loyal Gentry and their dependents; Theſe he
knows can neither be wheedled nor frighted generally, and
therefore all the Forces he provideth are only againſt theſe
Canaanites, who keep the good People out of the Land of
Promiſe; or make their lives uneaſie in it, by denying
them liberty of Conſcience to be of any Religion, or none,
as occaſion ſerveth; beſides, they have great Eſtates, good
meat and drink, and ſome Authority, all which belong to
the Godly.</p>
            <p>After Liberty of Conſcience he places a Lawleſs Licence
to do what he liſt,<note place="margin">Liberty and Property.</note> and take what he pleaſe; which he calls
Property; for he would fain have the Hedge broken down,
that all mens Eſtates, Wives, and Daughters might be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to him, which is the moſt beloved Notion he has <hi>Rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicae,</hi>
of a Commonwealth.</p>

His Study is well ſtuffed with ſeditious Pamphlets and
intelligences,<note place="margin">Books.</note> but his Staple Author is the Loviathan, which
he hath read ten times oftener than the Bible, and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſeth
a thouſand times more, yet he hath a good Parcel of
other Commonwealth Authors too, and admires nothing in
the Greeks and Romans but their hatred to Monarchy, and
love of Liberty and Popular Governments, and were it not
for this, would be contented all their Books were burnt.</p>
            <p>When all things are well he frights the little Folk with
Predictions of what may be,<note place="margin">Fears and Jealouſies.</note> or is intended ſhall be, and
the leſs probable the thing is, the more eaſily it is ſometimes
believed. Only the wonder is, men ſhould court Fear,
and fall in love with Jealouſie: which are uneaſie Paſſions
to them, but profitable to our Gentleman, who to create
them in his Followers, pretends himſelf horribly over run
with them; when indeed his only fear is, he ſhould not
(after ſo many Cheats put upon the People) be believed.</p>
