         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

may be a diligent and very ſufficient Teacher, and yet
not faithfull in his Miniſtery. This is faithfulneſſe,
when we are carefull to deliver the whole counſell of
God to his people, not concealing any part of it for fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,

<hi>1 Tim. 4. 12. Let no man deſpiſe thy youth, but be

Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>I prove the Propoſition by 4 reaſons:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, God hath placed us in this calling,<note place="margin">See M. <hi>Hilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham</hi> on Iohn, 4. <hi>pag.</hi> 289.</note> and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

given to every man to profit withall,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 7.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, every man ſhould count it his miſery to
be unprofitable, it is noted for a great part of the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of our eſtate by nature, <hi>that we are altogether unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable,</hi>
Rom. 3. 12. How much more a Miniſter?
<hi>Matth. 21. 30. Caſt yee the unprofitable ſervant into
utter darkneſſe, there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of
teeth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Nothing will yeeld us that comfort in
life or death, as this; not all the wealth wee have ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered,
nor the credit and applauſe we have had,
<hi>1 Theſs. 2. 19. They whom he had won to God were his hope,
and joy, and crown of rejoycing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, this is the chiefe thing that will aſſure us,
that God hath indeed called us to be Miniſters of his
Goſpell, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

hearts of the people, <hi>John</hi> 10. 3. as we know he did
to <hi>Pauls</hi> Miniſtery in the heart of <hi>Lydia, Acts</hi> 16. 14
We have heard all the Miniſters of the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
are called Reapers. The ſervants to whom God
committed his talents, if they were good and faithfull
ſervants, gained ſomewhat to their Maſter, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 23
Thus <hi>Paul</hi> approveth himſelfe to be an able Miniſter
of the Goſpell, the <hi>Corinthians</hi> that were converted
by his Miniſtery, were his letters of commendation
written in his heart (yeelding him much inward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort

                        <hi>Non-Reſidents</hi> labour not to be fruitfull and profitable in their Miniſtry, proved by ſix Reaſons.</note> that <hi>Non-Reſidents</hi> do not
labour to be fruitfull and profitable in their Miniſtery,
I thus prove:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe they are not diligent and painefull,
both in ſtudy and in preaching. <hi>Give attendance to
Reading, to Exhortation, to Doctrine; neglect not the gift
that is in thee, but both by diligence in Study and in
Preaching, labour to ſtirre it up, and increaſe it,</hi> ſaith the

Counſell of the Apoſtle they diſreſpect, as is manifeſt
to all men, <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, when they do teach (which is but ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
they teach that wherein they themſelves may
ſhew moſt learning or eloquence) not which may be
moſt profitable, and of uſe to them that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to their charge. Contrary to <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 1. and
3. 8.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:55826:19"/>
Thirdly, they do not apply their Doctrines to the
preſent eſtate and condition of their hearers, as they
are commanded, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 2.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, they do not take heed to their lives, as
they are required, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 16. for they ſwell with
pride, and are unſatiably addicted to outward things,
reaping moſt greedily, where they ſow ſparingly.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, they are not earneſt with God in Prayer,
that he would make their Miniſtery fruitfull, as <hi>Paul</hi>
was, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3. 14. they were never acquainted with
fervency in Prayer, and therefore in ſtead of praying,
they ſay, <hi>Let us pray for,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Finally, they do not enquire for fruit, and deale
with their people in private, to ſee how they profit by
their labours, as did our Saviour with his hearers,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 51. And the Apoſtle, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 20. who
did not only teach publikely, but from houſe to houſe.
And indeed how can they do thus, ſince they viſite
their Congregations but once or twice in the yeare,
and then having gathered up the profits of their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings,
they ſpeedily returne to their Dennes of idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
