            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>And when it pleased the Lord God everlasting to raise us up to be a People in the North parts, (and through <hi>great Tribulations</hi> and <hi>extream distresses</hi> within and without, which we passed through, were we raised up of the Lord to be a <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>chosen People</hi>) This same Person was one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the first of us whose heart the Lord touched with the sence of his <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Kingdom</hi>; and amongst us he had the mighty operation of the Power of God experienced in his heart; Great afflictions and tribulations for many weeks was he exercised in, through the dispensation of the Grace and Spirit of Christ Jesus; he was in that state, and while therein exercised for many dayes, a wonder to all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held him, as one passing out of the body, as one under the deep sence of the hand of the Lord, under the <hi>operation</hi> of his Power; thus it was with many of us, and particularly

His answer was, <hi>That there was no need to dispute matters, for he knew the ground of his Salvation, and was satisfied for ever in his peace with the Lord God, and we know</hi> (said he) <hi>one another wel, and what each of us can say about those things,</hi> and spoke no further: And the 17<hi>th.</hi> day of the 6th Month he departed this life, and was gathered up to his Fathers, the Generation of the just; and though he be gone in that bodily appearence, and his person removed from us, yet is his new-Name writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten among us, and his Memory can never die, for his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit still lives to praise the Lord, and the life which breathed

               <hi>RIchard Hubberthornes</hi> Love was very Great to all the Flock of God, and in the time of his health, he was a faithful Labourer in the worke of the Lord, and that you well know, and in the time of his sickness he did Express much Love to Friends, and was greatly refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in them; indeed he was a Vessel filled with a mighty Waighty Spirit, and all those who by that spirit were drawn near him, might see, know and feel him, and many there are that have a witness saying in them, Even so it was; indeed he was hid from many, and to them unknown, and therefore not prized, and now the Lord hath taken him into his own bosome, and many were not worthy of him; my whole family misseth him; for in the time of his health and sickness, he was a precious Example, and in his sickness he minded not one person more than another, but often smileing, minded neither life, nor death Visible, but was filled, with the
<pb facs="tcp:61974:9"/>
Invisible. So that his mind was redeemed out of visible things, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall times would say, The word of the Lord, is with me, and sayed that Faith which hath wrought my salvation, I well know, and have groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded satisfaction in it; but Faith as touching visible things, it was not much matter for minding of it, and said, I have more in me then I am free to Declare: as concerning Living or dying he had not many words, all the time of his sickness, but his minde was kept feeding in the retyred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness within, so that one might feel his strength in the still spirit which kept him so that I do not remember that ever I heard him groane all the time of his sickness; the seventh day in the morning, he asked for me, and when I came to him, he said This night or to morrow night I shall depart hence; &amp; the next day in the morning understanding that he asked for me, I arose &amp; went to him, &amp; after a while Sitting by him, he put his Arme about mee, and said Do not seek to hold me, for it is too strait for me; and out of this straitness I must go, for I am wound into largeness, and am to be lifted up on high, far above all; so in the Evening being the first day of the weeke, and the 17th of the 6 month he l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Minister of Jesus Christ; for no man knows the Son but the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and he to whom he is revealed: And thou that deniest im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate revelation, thou hast denied the Son of God, and hast shewed that thou hast not life; for he that hath not the Son of God, hath not life: And therefore we deny such Schools as <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> and <hi>Cambridge,</hi> where the rudiments of the world are invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: And abundance of filthy words are in the Answer to this Query, that are not worth mentioning.</p>

Here thou hast shewed thou dost not believe; For how can you believe, that receive honor one of another? and shewest that thou lovest it, as the Scribes and Pharisees did, and would not part with it, and art in thy pride and vain-glory, as the Scribes and Pharisees were, who say that is a civil honor and respect which Christ cryed wo against.

                  <hi>Rep.</hi> There was a time that they received Tythes, &amp; they might not neglect them, as denying their Tythes to the first Priesthood. There was a time after Christ, when he was sacrificed up, that he was preached the unchangeable Priesthood, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. then the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood which received tythes, was denyed; therefore the wo is come

They that preached the Gospel, who lived on the Gospel, denied the changeable Priesthood who received Tythes; but for shame you Ministers of <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Cambridge,</hi> stop your mouths, for they must be stopt; do not you sue men at the Law, and imprison men for Tythes? And here you shew you do not preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, for it will not maintain you; for them that preached the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, lived on the Gospel: There thou thief art taken, who hath gotten the Apostles words, who art for judgement.</p>

                  <hi>Pr.</hi> And in thy Answer to this Query thou art confused: First, thou sayest there is no Scripture for the word Sacrament; and yet thou sayest Christ commands it, and yet thou sayest there is not such a word in Scripture.</p>

               <p>In thy answer to this query thou bringest the Apostles words, (which said, <hi>pray alwayes</hi>) to justifie standing praying in the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, and having the chiefest place in the Assemblies, which Christ cryed wo against: And here I charge thee to be a false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, who puts no difference betwixt the Apostle and the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees; though he said, the Temple which <hi>Solomon</hi> built him, it was a <hi>house of prayer,</hi> Christ said there should not be one stone of it left upon another; when Christ Jesus was witnessed, <hi>Stephen</hi> for witnessing him, was stoned to death. And here thou hast shewed thou hast no judgement, and errs, not knowing the Scripture. And as for Christ's whipping them out of the Temple, read thy self; to the Light in thy Conscience I speak; and so all thy praying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thy Sermon, and after, as thou callest it, in the Synagogues, in the chiefest place of the Assemblies, the wo which Christ pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced against thy Fathers, hath light upon the son, thou who art found in the same place, let <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. judge thee; the life which gave forth these words, the life of these words is upon thee, and so all thy prayers are abomination to the Lord God, in the state thou art in; and the praying of the Saints who were mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the spirit, thou hast cleared thy self from; for thou deniest immediate Revelation from Heaven, and how canst thou pray and

Therefore it is not the knowing of it by Hebrew and Greek, but by the spirit that gave it forth; therefore all people take warning, and cease from such deceivers, and take heed to the light in your conscience, which is the light of Christ, to guide your minds up to God the Father of light, and be not deceived, nor wander not up and down after such, who know not the truth, but put Hebrew and Greek for the original, which <hi>Pilate</hi> had, which crucified Christ Jesus, as you may read in <hi>Luke</hi> 23.

            <p>
               <hi>WHereas I am committed to Prison by a Mittimus; under the pretence of the breach of the Law in these things therein ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed and laid to my charge: As first, Openly to declare before all the people, That he that preached, viz. Mr.</hi> John Mony <hi>was a deluder of the people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I answer, This accusation was false, for that word was not so spoken; but to the Light of Christ in all your consciences I speak, &amp; declare openly to all people, that he that acts those things which Christ declared against, is no Minister of Christ; all who are hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, as Christ saith, <hi>John</hi> 10. who seek for their gain from their quarters, as <hi>Isaiah</hi> saith, <hi>Isa.</hi> 56.11. who bear rule by their means, as <hi>Jeremiah</hi> saith, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.31. and who preach for hire, as <hi>Micah</hi> saith, <hi>Mic.</hi> 3.11. and all who are called of men Master, stand praying in the Synagogues, and have the chiefest places in the Assembly, and lay heavy burthens upon the people, which Christ cryed wo against, <hi>Matt.</hi> 23. such are no Ministers of Christ who act such things; for they who are the Ministers of Christ, do abide in the Doctrine of Christ; to the Light of Christ I speak, that with it <hi>John Mony</hi> may see himself to be out of the Doctrine of Christ, holding up those things that Christ cryed wo against.</p>
            <p>Another thing charged against me, is, <hi>That the people in a great number gathered together about me, which might have proved of evil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, they being the under-sort of people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I answer, Where-ever the gospel was preached, there were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therings together, and uproars and tumults, as you may read in the Scriptures <hi>Acts</hi> 19. and the same gospel worketh the same ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects now as in did then; and those whom thou callest the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort of people, were all quiet, and were willing to hear the word
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:61974:29"/>
of the Lord, and did not offer any persecution or violence; but you who profess your selves to be Saints, have proved your selves to be the undersort of people, as by your consequence, have made it appear by your persecution, by taking me out of the multitude who were willing to hear the Word of Truth, &amp; sent me to Bridewell, and then to prison, for declaring the Word of the Lord freely, as I have received it, and so are persecutors, and not Saints; for the Saints were ever persecuted, but never did persecute any.</p>
            <p>Another thing charged against me, is, That being often asked my Name and Countrey, would give no account.</p>
            <p>I answer, The Lord hath called me out of my own countrey, and from my Fathers House, to declare his Word as I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it; and I was freely declaring the Word of the Lord, when opposingly thou camest and asked my Name and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, which when I ceased speaking, I declared it unto thee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I went out of the yard; and so there is no ground for this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation but enmity.</p>
            <p>Another thing charged against me: <hi>That being brought before me, he in contempt of Magistracy (as I apprehended) would not once move his hat off his head.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I answer, O! for shame never profess to be a Magistrate, and make such apprehendings the ground of thy Law, as to call this contempt of Magistracy not to put off the hat! Where was ever such a thing mentioned in all the Scriptures, by any who were set to rule over the people, to execute the Law of God upon of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendors? When did <hi>Moses</hi> (who was a Law-giver and a Judge over all <hi>Israel</hi>) command any such thing of any that came before him, to put off his hat? or ever in all his Writings make menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of such a thing as contempt of Magistracy, or imprison any that did not? But it was the transgression of the Law of God to respect persons; for he that respects persons, commits sin; but by your Law, those who cannot respect persons, and so fulfil the Law of God, you say they contemn Magistracy, and are not to subject to Authority. Oh! for shame never make Laws upon such outward traditions; for here you go from the life of God, and from the law of God, and from the practice of all the holy men of God which the Scripture speaks of: When did ever <hi>Joshua</hi> or <hi>Japhat</hi> (when the people came before them) command any such thing,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:61974:29"/>
or mention it, to put off their hats, and prison them if they would not, or tell them they contemned Magistracy? When did ever <hi>Solomon</hi> (who was in the large Wisdom) command any such thing of the people whom he was over, to put off their hats; or imprison them if they would not? Shew me one example amongst all the Heathenish Emperors, Kings, Princes, Dukes, Rulers, or other Officers which the Scripture speaks of, that ever command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any of their people to put off their hats, and imprison them if they would not? Did ever <hi>Pharoah</hi> King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> whom <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> went before, command any such thing, and imprison them if they would not? Did ever <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> or <hi>Darius</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand any such thing of any? Did ever <hi>Herod</hi> command any such thing, or imprison them that would not? Did ever <hi>Agrippa</hi> or <hi>Festus</hi> command <hi>Paul</hi> to put off his hat vvhen he came before them? Here you outscrip all the Heathenish Kings &amp; Rulers that the Scripture speaks off. He contemns Authority vvho is a fighter or quarreller, or drunkard, or lyar, or swearer, and they vvho abuse themselves vvith mankind, but not they vvho declare the Word of the Lord to such, to lead them from all such practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; but such you account disturbers and contemners of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, who stand patiently before you, because they will not put off their hats; for it is your pride that is disturbed, and not Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice; for the Law of Justice is vvithout respect of persons, and doth judge thee vvho doth respect persons.</p>
            <p>Another thing charged against me, is, <hi>That I said I dwelt in God, and where the Lord called me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ansvver, Let shame and terror take hold upon you both Priests &amp; Magistrats, who make a Law in your wils to imprison those vvho come to vvitness they dvvel in God, as the Saints did: <hi>Paul</hi> said, <hi>In him we live, move, and have our being</hi>; and said he had no certain dvvelling-place; and by this Lavv he vvould be imprisoned, and he vvas persecuted and reviled, and suffered it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. and <hi>John</hi> said, <hi>He that dwells in love, dwells in God, and God in him,</hi> 1 Joh. 4.16. <hi>and he that keeps his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him: And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit that he hath given us,</hi> 1 John 3.24. and by this Lavv <hi>John</hi> should be imprisoned, because he said he dvvelt in God; and all the Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles did go vvhere the Lord called them. O blush and be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med before the Lord to profess Christ and Justice, and make a Lavv to imprison those vvho are obedient to the commands of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:61974:30"/>
God, and dwell in God; that ever such a thing should be acted, or once named in your Courts or Sessions, who profess your selves Christians.

            <p>A Brief and true testimony to all the people of the unjust and unlawful proceedings of those called Justices in <hi>Oxford,</hi> against two Northern women, who in obedience to the Lord, came to <hi>Oxford</hi> upon the 20 of the fourth Moneth, who se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral days as they were moved of the Lord, passed through the Streets, Colledges, and Steeple-houses, declaring the word of the Lord freely. And upon the 15 day being the first day of the week, were moved to go to a Steeple-house, and when the Priest had done, one of the women began to speak in answer to what was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, and in exhortation to the people. Then two of the justices cried out, <hi>Take her away, carry her to prison</hi>; and they took them away, and carried them to prison called <hi>Buckerdo</hi> where onely fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons and persons are committed for murther, and other hainous offences, are and secured. And on the morrow being the second day of the week, some of the Justices asked the Major, whether <hi>there was no meeting appointed</hi>; the Major said, <hi>No, he knew no business they had that there should be a meeting</hi>: the Justice answered, <hi>There is two Quakers committed to prison</hi>: the Major answered, <hi>Let those Justices that committed them, if they have any Law against them, let
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:61974:31"/>
them act it upon them; if not set them free:</hi> and the said Major said further, <hi>That he had nothing to say against them</hi>; but he said, <hi>that if they wanted food, money, or raiment, he would take care that they should be supplied.</hi> so the Major left them and went about his publick im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, and would have no more to do in the matter, nor act any thing against them; but did rather think it convenient to leave it to them, to act according to their wills, and he free from it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. But upon further consideration, and for the more satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Major went up where the Justices were to examine the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; and that their cruelty might the more be made manifest, the Vice-chancellour of the University was sent for to come up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, and then they proceeded to examination: and the first Question propounded, was, <hi>What her name was, and the place of her abode?</hi> and answer was made to both; then they asked, <hi>What their business was to</hi> Oxford? they answered, <hi>They were commanded of the Lord to come thither</hi>; they asked, <hi>What to do?</hi> they answered, <hi>To declare against sin and ungodliness, which they lived in; as pride, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness, lust, and all uncleanness, self-righteousness and all false worship, which both Priest and people lived in, contrary to the commands of God.</hi> Then they asked them, <hi>How they knew they were called of God?</hi> they said, <hi>They knew the voice of God, and that they were called of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this is to be observed as a true testimony of these two ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the Lord; that they did neither beg nor steal, neither did they wrong nor violence to any man; they coveted no mans sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, gold, nor apparel; but because they obeyed the word of the Lord, and did his work faithfully, speaking the word of the Lord in boldness against the deceits of the Priests and people, in the Streets, in the Market-place, in the Synagogues, and in the Colledges, clearing and discharging their consciences in the Lords work and service, freely administring that which they had freely recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the Lord, of whom they do receive their reward; for their reward is with them, and the presence of the Lord God doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company them; and for their obedience to the Lord they receive the shame of the world, as ever the servants of the Lord did; who were mocked, buff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tted, and shamefully used, being tied together at <hi>Johns</hi> Colledge and pumped, and kicked and buffetted, and thrust into a pool called <hi>Giles's</hi> pool, so that they went into a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote place to wash the dirt off their cloathes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:61974:31"/>And here both Magistrates and Schollers, and they who pretend to be Ministers of the Gospel, are the chiefest actors in this persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and so do make themselves manifest to be in the same generation of the Scribes and Pharisees, and Hypocrites, who were ever perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors of the righteous seed, whomever it hath brought forth: and so they fill up the measure of their fathers iniquities.</p>
            <p>Again, as concerning the Justices being assembled, the Vice-chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor being the chief actor in this persecution, said, <hi>That they blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed the name of God, and did abuse the Spirit of God, and dishonour the grace of Christ</hi>; and asked the women, <hi>Whether they did read the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures</hi>; they answered, <hi>Yea, they did</hi>; then they asked them, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were not to be obedient to the power of the Magistrate</hi>; they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, <hi>They were obedient to the power of God, and to the power as it was of God, their souls were subject unto it for cons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Well,</hi> said the Vice-chancellor, <hi>you prophane the word of God, and I fear you know not God though you so much speak of him.</hi> And then they concluded, that there was matter enough for their commitment and punishment, and wished the women to withdraw, consenting that a paper should be drawn up for their being whipped out of the City. And when the paper was drawn up, it was presented to the Major to set his hand to it; but the said Major refused, and said; <hi>He was not willing to do it</hi>; but one of the Justices said, <hi>That it was the privil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And the next morning their wills was performed, though with much unwillingness in the executioner. Many other particulars might be mentioned of their sufferings, afflictions, and patience under reproachings, revilings, slanders, and false accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions cast upon them, which is the portion of the righteous in the world, as Christ said, <hi>Blessed are you when men shall revile you, and persecute and speak all manner of evil against you falsly for my names sake: rejoyce and be exceeding glad, for great is your reward in heaven, for so persecuted they the Prophets that were before you,</hi> Mat. 5.11, 12.

            <p>And herein is made manifest your tyranny and persecution, the chief Priest being the chief actor in it; yet there was many in the City, that have so much of the light of Christ made manifest in them, as to acknowledge them to be servants of the living God, and to own them in their sufferings, and to confess the appearance of Christ in them before men, and in love did accompany them out of the City, and did own them in their persecution.</p>
            <p>And this testimony is true to testifie to all people, and to all the world, the cruelty of unreasonable men, and that the Major had no hand in any of this cruel usage and persecution.</p>

               <p>TO all my dear friends whom the Lord by his eternal spirit is gathering out of the World into the covenant of Life, to be of one heart and mind, and soul. Wait all in that which is pure and invisible, that the pure teachings of Christ you may know every one in particular which is without form and beauty to the visible, that nothing you may receive but that which speaks from the eternal moving of the living God; have salt in your selves to savour with all words; you may discern which is without life and power, and standing single in that which is pure of God, all such deny to be your teachers which have the words of truth, but live not in the life and power of what they say; so in the power of the living God wait in silence of all flesh, and here comes that which hath been fed to be famisht; and that which hungers after God, comes to receive living nurture and nourishment from God. So in the invisible comes to feed upon the bread of life which comes from heaven, and the tender plants will come to grow up unto eternal life, and fruit will be brought forth unto God, dwelling in that which is invisible; and all untimely fruit will wither and fade away; but keeping low in the light, that in it your minds may be kept, discerning will grow as the light doth arise and spring up in you; you will discern all airy spirits, who through great swelling words would allure and draw all the minds of those who have escaped the common pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the world, through the knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ: so all dear friends, in that which is pure wait, and in it watch against the nature which would keep you in bondage to corruption, and out of the glorious liberty of the sons of God, and from the glory of the first body, and out of the order and course of nature, and out of the Covenant where all things are blessed: now in that which hath convinced you wait, that in it you may see that which is gone

            <head>The innocency of the righteous seen of God, cleared from all slanderous tongues and false accusers.</head>
            <p>IN answer to a printed paper set forth by <hi>Frederick Woodall,</hi> wherein he goes about to render the truth of God odious, and by a cloak of maliciousness to cover those lies which he hath formerly published; but in the light of God, I do him see and comprehend, and in it he is made manifest to all the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of light to be no Minister of Christ; and to the light of Christ in all consciences I speak, that in it they may read these things which from the light is declared, that so occasion may be cut off from all who seek occasion against the truth; that so peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples minds may not be incensed against the truth of God by his refuge of lyes set forth in his paper, called <hi>Natural and Spiritual light distinguished.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in the light of Christ, which is but one, which is not natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral but spiritual, is he seen to be natural, and his distinction to be natural; and so in the light the natural man with his natural do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and natural distinction is denied; and Christ Jesus we do wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, who is the true light which lighteth every one that cometh into the world, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.9.</p>
            <p>I am come a light into the world that whosoever believeth in me should not abide in darkness, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.46. and this is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of the world, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather then light, because their deeds were evil, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.19, 20, 21.</p>
            <p>Now all you who are enlightned by Christ Jesus and can read in the light, and with understanding, to you there is no occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of stumbling; but all stumbling and the occasion of it, is in them who hates the light and calls it natural, which light is Christ: for him a witness I am against all such who deny Christ to be the true light, which lighteth every one that cometh into the world; who is of the World called <hi>Richard Hubberthorn.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>I answ.</hi> This accusation is returned back again upon thy own head; for the poison of asps is found under thy tongue, and forth of the venome doth proceed, as all who hath understanding may see and discern, and those whom thou callest thy dear brother and sister are made able in the light to testifie against thee and thy lie, and to witness that they are brought out of the Prosylites conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and out of the leaven of the false Prophets and false teachers, which they were in so long as they followed thy doctrine; but now that doctrine they do see which doth leaven and draw peoples minds to the light of Christ within them, and so makes Prosylites and children of the Devil; but in the light of Christ art thou and all that uphold that doctrine, seen and denied.</p>
            <p>In the first page of thy paper thou wouldst make people believe that thou makest no defence against my reply to thy answers, and yet in the second page thou repliest against mine, concerning the tenth Querie, and chargest me in reputing thee the author or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

            <p>I answer, Let every one that hath a desire to know whether this be so, read thy own words in thy printed Paper in thy answer to the tenth Querie, in the twelfth page, whether these be not thy own words; the tenth is intolerable and the rest of thy words which are in answer to that Querie are full of confusion, and all wdo reads them may see it; so I leave thee to be judged of all, and condemned of all, who in the light of Christ do see thy confusion which proceeds out of thy own mouth.</p>

And again thou art bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing scriptures to prove the letter to be the word of God: which Scriptures will witness against thee; for the Scripture saith that God is the Word, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.1. and thou art diminishing from some, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to others, and perverting the Scriptures to thy own ends; thou bringst that scripture in <hi>Titus</hi> 2.10, 11, 12, 13. and these words thou speakest from them, this is the grace of God bringing salvation; when the Apostle saith, For the grace of God that bringeth salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath appeared to all men, teaching us that denying un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godliness and worldly lusts we should live soberly, righteously and godly in this present world: and here though thou bringest this scrip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Pr. <hi>This Word for the manner of delivery unto us, is called Scripture,

and we are commanded to search it,</hi> Joh. 4.39. <hi>and laid under the promise of blessing in that way,</hi> Psal. 1.2.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Here thou hast numbred thy self amongst those whom Christ commanded to search the Scriptures, and amongst them shalt thou be numbred, and in that scripture thou mayest read thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and the rest of the Priests with thee, as <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.37.38.39 40. ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape, and ye have not his word abiding in you; for whom he hath sent ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him not, search the scriptures, for in them ye think to have eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life, and they are they which testifie of me, and ye will not come to me that ye might have life: now all you who are in the same con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, the same command is unto you. But there is no promise of blessing promised unto you in that way, no more then was to them which was so commanded, but never prove your selves Ministers of Christ, for they were no Ministers of Christ that this was spoken unto, nor Saints, but such as received honour one of another as you do who are in that generation. And they were such as did not believe that which they did profess, <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets; but Christ tells them plainly they did not believe <hi>Moses</hi> nor his writings; &amp; al you no wthat profess Christ, you cannot believe Christs words, who saith, He is the true light which doth enlighten every one that cometh into the world. Therefore out of the doctrine of Christ you are shut, and out of the Scriptures which you do profess; for the Sons life which witnesseth the Scriptures, you deny, and are strangers unto; <hi>He that hath an ear to hear, let him hear.</hi>

commandements of God will be of none effect through reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; Here I charge thee to be a blasphemer, and dost speak that thou hast no scripture for, and contrary to the scriptures, and contrary to the Apostles doctrine; for <hi>Paul</hi> did witness Christs second coming, which was in the spirit, as in <hi>Gallatians</hi> 2. and 2. and saith, I went up by revelation and communicated unto them that Gospel which I preached amongst the Gentiles; and he did witness the Son of God revealed in him, and all the Apostles, who did witness him to be come again to them the second time, to reveal the will of the Father unto them; this did not make the commandements of God to be of none effect, and the same Christ we do witness to be come, and hath revealed the Fathers will unto us; for no man knows the Father but the Son, and he to whom the Son reveals him; this we do witness, eternal living praises to him for evermore; and by his revealing his Son in us, his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements are fulfilled; and so all such we do deny, that say by the revelation at the second coming of Christ they shall be made of none effect.</p>

and made manifest, and did never tell of Christ's second com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in person, nor of his personal reign; and thou that tells of such a deceit, that except ye live out of the Gospel, ye cannot live in the Spirit; here thy deceit is indeed made manifest, and thy life, who would separate the Gospel from the Spirit: But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst that life and deceit we bear witness, who by this Spirit do, and according to the Gospel.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Here thou hast professed thy self long to be a Teacher and preached against Popery, and hast not been ashamed to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse others of it, who stand clear in the truth of God, witnessing against all such wayes of da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Priest. <hi>If they will establish implicite faith, thus it may be done,</hi> Job 1.14. <hi>The Oxen were plowing, and the Asses feeding besides them</hi>; (i. e. <hi>the Priests were preaching, and the people believing, this is to cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Word of God.</hi>)</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:61974:39"/>Here thou art proved and made manifest to be a false Teacher, who art teaching people how to establish implicite faith; and to blind the eyes of people, thou bringest that Scripture <hi>Job</hi> 1.14. when as there is no such word as implicite faith spoken of there; nor in the Scripture thou finds no such word; nor did ever any of the Ministers of God teach people how to establish any such thing; and those priests who preach that, and that people which believe it, do make the Word of God of none effect through tradition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Priest.</hi> Thou art charging and accusing some to hold forth the mysterie of iniquity in principles, and to affirm a community of persons and things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> The mysterie of iniquity we know, and them in whom it worketh in all deceivableness of unrighteousness; and from it and its workings we are separated by Christ Jesus, and in his Light do see and comprehend its workings in the children of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience; and all vile and unclean persons, who are in the lusts of uncleanness, and in the mystery of iniquity, and all things which are separated from the light, we have no union nor fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship with; and all these practices we do deny, which are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, which is acted contrary to the light, which is pure, in which we are called (not unto uncleanness, but) unto holiness: And to this God is our Witness, and our Consciences also bears us witness against all false accusers. So I charge thee who hath put forth this accusation, to turn thy mind to the light of Christ in thy conscience, &amp; with it thou may see in thy self the ground where this mysterie of iniquity worketh; and thou may see in thy self that which hath unity, with that which is unclean, the lusts of uncleanness, inordinate affections, and evil concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scence; the ground which the mysterie of iniquity worketh in, is yet standing in thee; and so of the same things of which thou accuses others, art thou found guilty, which is for condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the light.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Here thou hast perverted <hi>Paul</hi>'s words, and speaks thy own invention contrary to the Scripture; for <hi>Paul</hi> did not say, 'tis pity Christ should be the foundation, but said, other foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons can no man lay, than what is laid, which is Jesus Christ, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> In the Light of Christ we dwel, which comprehends thy Wisdom, which is earthly, sensual and devillish, and from that Wisdom these things published forth in thy paper do proceed, which is full of lyes and confusion; but in the Light of Christ made manifest in those thou calls <hi>Quakers,</hi> art thou seen to be in that Wisdom which is not perfect; and so thee and thy Word we do deny, which is for condemation with the Light, which is contrary to thy earthly Wisdom.</p>

               <hi>Priest.</hi> Thou Priest <hi>Woodall</hi> art accusing me for numbering thee amongst those who are guilty of preaching for carnal things, who reap carnal things; and this thou makes thy defence, saying, <hi>This is my case, More then seven years I have served in the Gospel, where I am receiving what a people freely give for my Family, reproach in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things, refusing a considerable setled maintenance elsewhere.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Such as thou sowest, such shalt thou reap; and all they who have given thee money for preaching such things as thou hast here published forth in print, they have given thee money for that which is not bread, and so bought the carnal with the carnal; but their souls are yet made merchandize of; and that unjust gain which thou hast received this seven yeers from that people, will rise up in judgement against thee, who hast not only used it for thy necessity and support in outward things which were needful for the use of the body, but hast spent it upon thy lust and pride in thy family, spending more in lust and pride, and gay apparel, than those whom thou receivest the gift from: And thou who hast professed thy self to be a servant to that people, and they having given thee Wages so long for that which did not profit them, thou after the manner of the Gentiles hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised Authority and Lordship over them; and whereas thou

shouldest be their hired servant, they call thee Master; thou which should be the least of all amongst them, art greatest of all, exceeding them all in pride and high-mindedness, in ease, in pleasures, in idleness and fulness of bread; but as the Lord doth open the eyes of those whom thou hast kept in blindnesse and ignorance, they wil come to see thee and thy doctrine to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary unto the Gospel of Christ, as they may plainly see and read in those things which thou hast published forth in print, which is serviceable unto all who hath understanding, that thy confusion and folly, and lyes against the Truth, against Christ, against the Saints, and against the Scriptures they may see, which hath been long hid, but now is made manifest in the Light unto all who are come to know the free teachings of God, who will no more give thee money for speaking a divination of thy own brain, and not from the mouth of the Lord.</p>
            <p>Priest. <hi>Who knows not that Tythes and Glebes were under that dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation by Divine Law ordained for the maintenance of the Priests?</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Here thou wouldst make people believe that thou denies tythes, which was for the maintenance of the Priests under the Law: But as for the glebes which thou speaks of, there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any such thing ordained in the Law; here thou hast made it appear that thou art ignorant of that which was ordained for the Priests maintenance under that dispensation; for they had no inheritance nor glebe lands to maintain them, as some of the priests of <hi>England</hi> have; and yet those priests in <hi>England</hi> which do receive tythes, and so upholds that which thou seems to deny, yet thou owns them as thy brethren, and to be Ministers of the gospel: And here your deceit is so plainly made manifest, that you accuse one another, and condemn one another, all your hearts being exercised with covetous practices, preaching for fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy lucre, all being agreed together to persecute, revile and slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the pure truth of God where it is made manifest in his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to declare against all your deceits, that out of your snares the righteous seed of God may be delivered, to testifie against you and your Ministry, under which the Seed of God is kept in bondage.</p>
            <p>Priest. <hi>Reader, I have done; our Heavenly Father taketh sleeping Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples at the best,</hi> Matth. 26.40.</p>

               <hi>Ans.</hi> Here thou hast uttered forth a lye, that all may plainly see; who saith thou hast done, and in the next words saith, <hi>Our Heavenly Father taketh sleeping Disciples at the best</hi>: Now from this Scripture in <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.40. thy words are proved to be false; for in that condition the Disciples were then in, they were not at the best, who could not watch with Christ one hour; and the Comforter was not then come, which afterwards they did wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, by travel, and labour, and fasting, and prayer, and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing day and night they did witness; and we who do witness the same condition now, do testifie against thee, and all who make lyes of the Apostles, who did witness Jesus Christ in truth and uprightness of heart; and the same Christ do we witness, and do freely preach him to every Nation, being made manifest to that of God in every ones conscience to be witnessed.</p>
            <p>Now as my first Query is printed in thy paper, the latter part of it I deny, which was not given forth, nor spoken so by me· In thine it is written thus: <hi>How can that be said to be a natural Light, which witnesseth unto God, &amp; against the things of the Spirit of God</hi>?

And thou calls the image in which <hi>Adam</hi> was created, the essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial image, and the image of Christ thou calls a personal image; and hereby them who dwell in the Light, thou art seen out of the substance, in the images, making to thy self images and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses from thy imaginations; but in them thou canst not know God and Christ, nor the image of God in which <hi>Adam</hi> was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in innocency; and there is no such word in Scripture as <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential image</hi>; and here thou goest about to make three images, and so amongst the image-makers thou art, who art out of Gods commands, and there thou may read thy self.</p>
            <p>But now the Lord God is gathering his own seed by his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal light, out of all images and likenesses, to be conformed to the image of the Son, &amp; to bear his image who is invisible, which all the imaginers cannot enter into, who stumble at the Light; but all such are seen by the children of the Light, and denyed; for now do they witness from the Lord the day of Redemption, yea plenteous Redemption is now witnessed by them who dwell in the Light which comprehends the World, &amp; out of the World, and out of the Worlds teachings, and out of the Worlds wayes,

            <p>The second Accusation is, <hi>That we deny Baptism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> The Baptism of Christ we own, which all the Saints were
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:61974:42"/>
baptized into, which was by one spirit into one body, as in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13. and by this baptism we do witness the washing away of sin, not onely the washing avvay the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience towards God: But sprinkling of Infants vve deny, which there is no Scripture for. And all you who from your imagination do imitate <hi>Johns</hi> Baptism, and so go into the vvater, and say you are believers, and have right to the Ordinances of Christ; but you to be believers we deny, vvho are not yet come to repentance; and your Water-baptism, vvhich is but an imitation from the letter; for the Lord never sent you forth, nor commanded you either to preach or baptize, as they did vvhom you go about to imitate, vvho are not yet come to repentance, nor to the first principle of the doctrine of Christ, nor to ovvn the light of Christ in your consciences, which should exercise them, and lead you to vvait upon God, and lead you to repentance: And the Faith of believers you know not; for the mysterie of Faith is held in a pure conscience, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.9. vvhich you cannot vvitness, which hates the Light of Christ, vvhich should exercise your consciences; and so your minds and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences are defiled, and vvith that mind you talk of faith, and of the Ordinances of Christ, and of Water-baptism, vvhich serveth unto us for a figure, as the Apostle saith, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3 21. And Jesus Christ was baptized by <hi>John</hi> by water, <hi>that he might fulfil all righteousness,</hi> Mat. 3.15. And <hi>John</hi> was a Prophet, and Christ is the end of the Prophets; and <hi>Johns</hi> baptism was but a figure; for he said he did but baptize with water; but Christ is the end of all figures, types and shadows, and did fulfil them; for he fulfilled all righteousness, and <hi>Johns</hi> Ministry, and <hi>Johns</hi> baptism; and he that fulfilled all righteousness, the same baptizeth, which <hi>John</hi> did bear witness unto, <hi>and all men came unto him,</hi> Joh. 3 16, but he bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized none with water. But this is a mysterie to thy dark mind, which knows not the baptism of Christ, nor <hi>Johns</hi> doctrine, nor <hi>Jesus Christ the true Light, which enlighteneth every one that cometh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world,</hi> vvhich <hi>John</hi> bore witness unto, <hi>John</hi> 1.9. but goes to hold up the types and figures which Christ came to fulfil, and so deniest Christ to be come in the flesh to fulfil all righteousness, and so thou art an Antichrist, who holds up the figures which Christ came to fulfil; and so thou denies the Scriptures and Christ, who said he came to fulfil all righteousness; and the Saints baptism thou art ignorant of, which is, <hi>by one Spirit into

one body,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.13. And <hi>Paul</hi> who was a Minister of Christ, and preached the Gospel, did bring many into this baptism, and he was not sent to baptize with water, but to preach the Gospel; and all the Churches which he preached unto, came to witness Christs baptism with the Holy Ghost and with fire, by one Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit into one body, and were baptized into Christ who was the head of the body, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3. and by this baptism we are thus washed from all filthiness of flesh and Spirit; but your imitated baptism of water we deny, who live in your filthiness of flesh and spirit, whose minds and consciences are defiled; but the baptism of Christ we own, which purifies our consciences from dead Works, and keeps our minds undefiled by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3 5.</p>
            <p>The third accusation is, <hi>That we deny the Sacrament, which is an Ordinance of Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> For the word <hi>Sacrament,</hi> there is no such Scripture which speaks of a Sacrament; therefore we do deny you and your Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and your Bread and Wine, which is carnal, and feed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And the bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ? for we being many, are one bread, for we are all parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of that one bread,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.16, 17, 21, 22. <hi>And this is the bread which came down from Heaven; he that eateth thereof, shall never dye</hi>: And this Bread we all eat of, and this cup we all drink of, and this is that which is practised and commanded in the Church of Christ; and so we sit at the Table of Christ, and cannot sit nor have fellowship with the Table of Devils: And they who sit at your Table, and your Sacrament, and eat of your Bread, and drink of your Wine, they dye, for it is not the bread of life;
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:61974:43"/>
and you who eat and drink it, do not discern the Lord's body; for it is spiritual, and your Sacrament is carnal; <hi>and so you eat and drink damnation to your selves, not discerning the Lords body,</hi> feeding the carnal with the carnal; and so we deny your Sacrament to be any Ordinance of Christ, or the Supper of Christ, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.29.</p>
            <p>The fourth Accusation is, <hi>That we deny the resurrection of the Body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> And that is false; <hi>for at the sound of the last Trumpet the dead shall be raised; they that have done good shall arise to the resurrection of life; they that have done evil, to the resurrection of condemnation. And we preach Christ risen from the dead; and if the dead rise not, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also in vain, and you are yet in your sins, who know not this resurrection, Christ risen from the dead in you,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.14, 15, 16, 17. <hi>But some man will say, How are the dead raised? and with what bodies do they come</hi>? 1. Cor. 15.35. <hi>Thou fool, that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other grain, but God giveth it a body as it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth him, and to every seed his own body. There is also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial; and the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another; there is one glory of the Sun, another glory of the Moon, and another glory of the Stars, for one star differs from another star in glory. So also is the resurrection of the dead; it is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption; it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power; it is sown a natural body, it is rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed a spiritual body,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.35.36, 37, 38. <hi>Now this I say unto you all, That flesh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But this is to you all a mystery, who are in the first nature, whose understandings are not enlightned by the light of Christ, who live in your forms, notions, and professions of these things in the Letter, feeding your carnal minds with the Letter, which is death, and killeth, and so your minds are drawn from the Light of Christ within you, into outward observances of meats and drinks, bread and wine, <hi>divers washings &amp; carnal Ordinances, which were figures of the time then present, Heb.</hi> 9.9, 10. and you deny Jesus Christ the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, who is the true Light that enlighteneth every one that cometh into the World. Now to the Light in you all I speak, which Christ Jesus hath enlightened you withall; and if you love this Light, it will lead you out of all your carnal Ordinances,

            <p>The fifth Accusation is, <hi>That we do not honor Magistrates, nor are subject unto Authority, but are disturbers and breakers of the peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Justice we own, and righteousness; and all who love the Light of Christ which he hath enlightened them withall, it will lead them to act Justice. And all Magistrates, I charge you in the presence of the living God, to act according to that which is pure of God in the conscience: And all Magistrates who act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of God in the conscience, are honored by those who fear the Lord, and walk in obedience to that in the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and those who act justice according to that in the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, they do not bear the sword in vain, for that in the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is according to the law of God; and all you Magistrates who are set over the people to do Justice, and execute the lavv upon offendors, this is the Word of the Lord to you, To mind the Light of Christ in your consciences, and it vvill cause you to act according to the place of a Magistrate: But if you suffer Svvearers, and Drunkards, or Lyars, or Oppressors, or false Weights, or Strikers, or Quarrellers, or Fighters, and do not punish them, or Whoremongers, or Idolaters, or idle persons, vvithout a calling; &amp; thou that passeth by these things, &amp; dost not act justice according to the lavv, then thou acts not according to that light in the conscience, and thou bears the svvord in vain, and that in the conscience vvill take hold upon thee, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn thee, and vvil execute the righteous lavv of God upon thee vvho refuseth to act according to that in the conscience; but those vvhom you call <hi>Quakers,</hi> act according to that in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,

and they are no fighters, no strikers, no drunkards, no swearers, no oppressors, no whoremongers, no idolators, no for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicators, no lyars, no scorners, no revilers, no false accusers, not proud, not high-minded, not thieves, not murtherers; for they give obedience to that in the conscience which crucifies them to all these things, and so the Law cannot take hold upon them; and from the Lord do they declare against all these things where they are yet standing, which the Law of God takes hold upon. And you who are called Magistrates and Justices, as you pass through the streets in the Cities and in the Markets, you may hear men swear and lye, and be drunk in the Ale-houses, &amp; you pass by them: And when any of the servants of the Lord, who are sent of the Lord into the Markets or Cities, and declare the Word of the Lord against drunkards, swearers and lyars, who are cheating one another, and cozening one another, and bid them repent, and declare to them the just judgement of God which is to fall upon them, and all such whom thou who art a Magistrate, hath neglected to act Justice upon, and to punish ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the law, then they who are drunkards, fall a fighting and striking, and hales them to thee vvho art a Magistrate, who shouldst punish the drunkards and swearers, fighters &amp; strikers; and thou saist, <hi>they have disturbed the people, and broken the peace,</hi> when they have declared the Word of the Lord against sin &amp; ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and all the unrighteousness of men, which thou should have punished by the Law: And thou art called a Justice of peace, and this is thy peace which is kept with drunkards, swearers, strikers and fighters, and is disturbed by the Word of the Lord declared from the mouth of the Lord by his servants against all these things, who art not guilty of any of those things: And here thou art no Minister of God, but an encourager of evil doers, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courager of those that do well, vvho declare justice from God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst those whom thou should act justice upon; and when they are brought before thee, thou wouldst have them to honor thee, who art a vile person, and no Minister of God, and no honor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs unto thee, but he who ministers justice from that which is pure of God in the conscience, is worthy of double honor; &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they wil not honor thee, vvho acts no justice, but according to thy <hi>corrupt wil</hi> &amp; is not obedient to that of <hi>God</hi> in the <hi>conscience,</hi> thou sends them to prison, or out of the City or Markets, or <hi>stocks</hi> or <hi>whips</hi> them; &amp; if a <hi>drunkard</hi> or <hi>swearer</hi> wil put off his hat to thee
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:61974:45"/>
and bow to thee, and call thee Master, thou dost not imprison such an one, nor punish him neither with Stocks nor Whips, nor counts him any breaker of the peace: And here they who break the peace, and act contrary to the Law of God, are spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and are at liberty; and they who keep the peace, and do vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to no man, they are punished by those who should act Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice in the Land. And here iniquity is set in the place of Justice, and is at liberty, and Truth is imprisoned by the Rulers of the Nation.</p>
            <p>And to all Rulers I speak from the Lord to that in your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences; minding it wil let you see who it is that is not subject to Authority; Whether they that are drunk, or they who declare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst drunkenness; Whether thty that swear, or they who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare against swearing, and deny to swear at all; Whether they that fight, and strike, and beat one another, or they who never lift up a hand against any man, but declare the Word of the Lord against such things.</p>
            <p>And them whom you call <hi>Quakers</hi> are no drunkards, nor no swearers; for Jesus Christ saith, <hi>Swear not at all, but let your yea b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And you are the same generation now: for any vvho are sent of the Lord novv to preach repentance, to turn you from your iniquities, that your minds might be turned to the Light of Christ vvithin you, vvhich vvill check you for sin and evil; then your cities are on an uproar against them, to persecute them, and so you fill up the measures of your fathers iniquity.</p>

            <p>1.

               <hi>Ans.</hi> But in contradiction to that, in page 11. he saith, that Christ ascended far above all Heavens, that he might fill all things, to wit, with his Light, Eph. 4.11. So here he hath answerd himself; for if Christ that is ascended, doth fill all things with his Light, then he doth not make mens hearts void of Light. In page 17. he saith, <hi>That Christ enlightens the world with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, as the Prophet of the Church</hi>; and if so, then men want not Light to guide them in the knowledge of their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the way to salvation; so herein he hath answered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, to his own confusion.</p>
            <p>Again in page 43. he saith, <hi>That none of the Gentiles not barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous people, who had not the Scripture, nor such other teachings as God's People were taught by, had the Light within them; which might be a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>mpleat and safe rule or guide to them for the pleasing of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:61974:48"/>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> In contradiction unto which, he saith in page 60. that Christ as the Mediator, enlightens with spiritual Light every man that cometh into the World; and pag 62. That he enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens Gentiles as well as Jews, with a spiritual Light. And page 63. that Christ as the Sun of Righteousness was to enlighten all Nations. So then, if those latter be true, then the former is false; for if all that come into the World, both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> be enlightened with a spiritual Light by Christ as their Mediator, and as he is the Sun of Righteousness, then they do not want a Light within them, which is a compleat and safe Rule or Guide to them for the pleasing of God; and so by this the <hi>Quakers</hi> Doctrine is approved and made good, instead of being disproved.</p>
            <p>Again, that <hi>John Tombs</hi> may appear to be wise above what is written, he goes about to prove many Lights under several names and distinctions; as page 12. he saith, <hi>There are Lights that like</hi> ignis fatuus, <hi>foolish fire, lead men into dark places, lakes and bogs, wherein they that follow them, perish.</hi> Secondly, <hi>There are lights that for a while lead men in the way, and then soon go out, and so leave men in darkness and perplexity.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>That there is an amazing light, that doth by its brightness strike dead, and cast down to the Earth,</hi> Rev. 1.16, 17. Acts 22.6.11. Act; 9.9. Fourthly, <hi>Christ is an excelling light, not striking dead, nor casting down; nor blinding,</hi> Fifthly; <hi>That there was a light in the law, but it was imperfect.</hi> Sixth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>That there is a bodily light in animate bodies.</hi> Seventhly, <hi>That there is a natural light of Creatures.</hi> Eighthly, <hi>There is a rational light of men,</hi> pag. 16. Ninthly, <hi>That there is a Scripture-light; and</hi> (saith he) <hi>the Word which is written in my Bible, shall be my light,</hi> page 80.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> In that which is above-mentioned, he appeareth to be puffed up by vain conceits, imaginations and distinctions, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove what is written in the Scriptures of Truth, till he mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fests himself to be wholly in darkness, not knowing what he saith, nor whereof he affirmeth: For where doth the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture speak of any Lights like false fire that leads men into dark places, Lakes and Bogs? but we read in the Scriptures, that <hi>he that walks in darkness, knows not whether he goes</hi>; and there is the perishing in the Lakes: And where doth the Scriptures
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61974:48"/>
speak of such Lights as for a while lead <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>n in the way, and then go out when men are in the way, and so leave them in darkness? And where do the Scriptures speak of a natural Light, and a bodily Light, and a rational-Light, and a Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Light? And whereas thou speakest of an amazing light, that by its brightness doth strike down dead, and cast down to the Earth, and brings <hi>Rev.</hi> 1 16, 17. <hi>Acts</hi> 22.6, 11. <hi>Acts</hi> 9.9. whereas it saith, <hi>That the light of Christ's countenance was as the Sun shining in his strength, which when John saw him, fell at his feet dead</hi>; and <hi>Paul</hi> with the light was struck down; which Light ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing to <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> was Christ; yet in the next words contrary to the Scriptures and thy own assertions, saith, <hi>That Christ is an excelling light, not striking dead, nor casting down, nor blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>: And so thy words is but as a heap of confusion and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction one unto another, and to the Scriptur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>; and so in a few words thou maist be answered, even with thy own dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; for if thou knew the Light of Christ in the least measure, it would keep thee out of the line of this confusion; and then thou would justifie those whom now thou condemns and falsly accuseth to be guilty of thy own devisings.</p>
            <p>Again, Another contradiction concerning the Light, from page 33. thou saist, <hi>That light from Christ as Creator, is conferred upon all men without exception of any person</hi>: And to contradict it, in p. 37. he saith, <hi>that the Gentiles are without light.</hi> And p. 66. <hi>that Christ enlightens Gentiles as well as Jews, with his spiritual light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> So to what end is all thy preaching and printing, but to utter forth thy own confusion? And dost thou think that all people are blind as thy self, that cannot see plain contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Nay, for the light is risen in which thou art seen, if thou hadst more subtilty, craft and guile to cover thy self withall, than thou hast; but thou hast appeared naked, that every one may see thy shame.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>John Tombs</hi> in the 26. page saith, <hi>that in this life they that are born of the Spirit, are flesh</hi>; whereas Christ saith, <hi>He that is born of the spirit, is spirit.</hi>

               </gap> which we are raised up, is witnessed in this life, whereby the Apostle said they were made members of Christ, and were joined unto the Lord by that one Spirit of which they were born: And is this the Faith which thou begets people into, that they cannot be born again in this life, of the Spirit? So they have believed and followed thee long enough; for they were but in the fleshly birth before thou came amongst them, and are so yet, and must not be born of the Spirit by thy do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, while in this life, until the resurrection; and so that they may believed thee, and not Christ, thou strivest to keep them from minding of his Light within them, whereby they should be led to believe in him, which saith, <hi>They that are born of the spirit, is spirit; and that they must first be born, before they ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Again, pag. 29. saith, <hi>That of such corruption as</hi> David <hi>was guilty of in the matter of</hi> Uriah, <hi>want of Light to guide in the way of happiness, is a chief part.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans. David</hi> did not want Light as the cause or chief part of his sin, but was disobedient unto the Light which he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and that was the cause why he did the thing that was sin against the Lord; but in this, as in the rest of thy Book, thou wouldst charge all iniquity upon the want or insufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Light, and not upon the creatures disobedience to it; and so contrary to the Scriptures, would make mans de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction not to be of himself, or his separation from God not to be by his sins, but the insufficiency of the Lights and so accuseth the Light, and not the darkness; and accuseth God,

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> it the greatest curse to leave a man to the Light in him; which Light before thou hast confessed to be spiritual, and to be the Light of the knowledge of God; and now thou saist, To leave man to the Light, is to leave man to his lusts and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations: What, is now Light become lust and imaginations? Why then doth thy Brother <hi>Baxter</hi> in his Epistle tell us, that it is to be hearkened to, and obeyed? What are you now agreed to call the Light darkness or lust? and when you have done so, that men may hearken unto it, and obey it? Here is break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the command, and teaching others to do so. In page 68. of thy Book thou tells us, That the Teachers of the Law did teach many things right about God's Being, Works &amp; Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and yet thou saist, that in other things they were as blind as Molds: But in this hast thou not much more condemned
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61974:50"/>
thy self to be more blind then they are? for they taught Christ aright about God's Being, Works and Worship; but thou hast taught things false about these things; for the Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of the Law did never say, That to leave men to the Light was the greatest curse; but said, <hi>That Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart,</hi> Psal. 97.11. And said also, <hi>that the path of the just is as the shining Light.</hi> Neither did they ever call the Light lust nor imagination, as thou hast done; but when thou art sober, and seest thy confusion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider whether it be not rather the greatest curse and judgment from God, to leave a man to his own darkness and ignorance, (as thou art) because he hates and despiseth the Light which should lead him to knowledge and understanding of God, and of his ways; and is it not Justice in God to give you up to the darkness of your own hearts and lust, which thou falsly calls Light, seeing it is your daily exercise to study, p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>each &amp; print against the sufficiency of Christ's Light, which people should believe in, and obey, and which is the path of the just, and way to God, out of that darkness which hath blinded your eyes even so far, that you cannot see your own words, much less the Truth of God, as it is manifest unto them that walk in his Light.</p>
            <p>And in thy next Argument thou sayest, <hi>That because the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie of God was hid, and Life and Immortality not brought to light to the Gentiles, therefore they had not a light within them as a sufficient guide to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Thou mightest as well have said in plain words, That Christ who was given a Light to the Gentiles, was not able to reveal the mysterie of God, nor bring life and immortality to light, because some were ignorant of it; but contrary to thy false Argument, Christ was given a Light to the Gentiles, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ich light did reveal the mysterie of God, life and immortality to them who did receive him; and those that did not receive him, though he was given for a Light unto them, because they did not receive him, therefore was those things hid, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Light was not sufficient.</p>
            <p>1. Argument, Rom. 8.9. <hi>Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, the same is none of his</hi>: Whence thou argues, <hi>They have
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61974:50"/>
not light within them sufficient to guide them to God who have not the Spirit of God: but every man hath not the Spirit of God</hi>; Ergo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withall, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7. Which manifestation being obeyed is able to lead man to God, so that there is no insufficiency in the Spirit or Light, in which God hath mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested something to every man, and therefor if every man be not guided by it unto God, it is because he doth not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently obey and follow it.</p>
            <p>12. Argument, From Matthew 11.27. John 14.16. Where thou Argues, <hi>they had not a light within them sufficient to guide them to God, to whom the Son did not reveal the Father, who did not go by the Son as the way to the Father, but the Son did not reveal the Father to every man, nor did every man come to Christ,</hi> John 1.5.10. Ergo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> The cause why they had not life, and did not come to the Father, was because they would not come unto him that they might have Life, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.40. and not because his light in them was not sufficient; for these Jewes did for a season rejoyce in the Light; which if they had continued in, would have led them to the knowledge of the Father, and of the Son, as those of understanding sees in those Scriptures which thou hast asserted; and so thus in all thy Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to manifest thy Ignorance of the Scripture and of the Light, instead of charging mens guilt of disobedience, thou charges the light of Christ to be insufficient; for they that did love and receive the light which Christ had enlightned them withall, to them it was given to know the Mysteries of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven; but to those which did hate, reject and count it insufficient, those things from them was hid, and their rejection was the cause of hiding those things and not the light; and this may answer the most of thy Arguments, and let thee see how thou stumbles because thou hates the light which should discover unto thee both the cause of knowledge, and of ignorance, and the ground from whence they both arise.</p>
            <p>In many other of thy Arguments, thou proves nothing thou intendest, but accusing falsly the <hi>Quakers,</hi> as in the 15, 16, 17.21, 22. Arguments: where thou saist, <hi>That they forbid

            <p>And whereas several other Arguments is made upon false grounds, as that the supposed light in a man may lead him into a way whose end is death, this only belongs to thy selfe, thou art guilty of it; for the true Light would have led thee to have spoken Truth, and to have accused no man falsly, and would not have suffered thee to have opposed by plain contradiction Christs Words, nor to have perverted the Scriptures in making them a ground for thy false Arguments; and so that Argument against thy selfe <hi>stands,</hi> and that thy supposed light leads into a way whose end is Death. Again thou saist in some of thy Arguments, <hi>If e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man have a light sufficient to guide him, then there needs no trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming nor renewing, nor putting off the Old Man, nor should be no foolishness, nor need of a Rod of correction, nor need any train up a Child in the way he should go, nor need not learne Childrens Literature or good manners, and other things of the like Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> This is as if thou shouldst say, that Christ is come into th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Again <hi>John Tombes</hi> in page 5. pretending to answer the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> Objections (which was never by them Objected) goeth about to pervert the Scripture, <hi>Luke</hi> 17.21. <hi>Behold the Kingdom of God is wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Here thou wouldst make people believe strange things, or Preach a new Doctrine which hath not been heard or read of before: thou hast said, That the Word written in the Bible is thy light, but there is not such a Word written in that Bible, that saith that the Kingdom of God was not before Christs appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in the flesh, but thou may finde it written in the Bible, <hi>that his Kingdom is an everlasting Kingdom, Dan.</hi> 7. Was not the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God before the World was? was not the Kingdom of God in the time of <hi>Enoch, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob, Abraham, Moses</hi> and the <hi>Prophets</hi>? And when the Apostles did Preach the Kingdom of God was come nigh unto them, and was at hand, did they not Preach that which was in the beginning? But herein it is manifest, that thou neither own Scripture Light, nor Scripture Words, but this Doctrine few will believe, that the Kingdom of God was not before Christs appearance in the flesh; And therefore it is retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned back upon thee, that thou mayest see and be ashamed of what thou hast declared from thy darkness,</p>

            <p>And in the same page 55. thou sayest, <hi>It is a meer fantastick de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion, to imagine a Christ in themselves different from that Jesus Christ born of</hi> Mary, <hi>who is the Saviour of the world.</hi>

            <p>Again page 41. thou hast accused <hi>Paul</hi> falsly, saying, <hi>that Paul followed the light within him, and yet he accounted this his great sin,</hi> Act. 26.9. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ. Paul</hi> in these Scriptures doth not say that he followed the light within him, but he followed his thoughts which led him to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus; and what he did it was ignorantly in unbelief, and that was his sin, and not following the light within, but if it be sin to follow the light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, why doth <hi>Baxter</hi> and thou say, <hi>that a man should hearken to it, follow it, and obey it.</hi> And <hi>Baxter</hi> saith, <hi>that he is no Christian that denies it</hi>; and so here thy reverend brother hath proved thee to be no Christian.</p>
            <p>Again page 50. thou sayest, <hi>If</hi> David <hi>had had a light within him of it self a sufficient and safe guide to God, he should not have been jealous of his own heart and thoughts, so as to need God to search, know and try him; but it is otherwise with</hi> David, <hi>and therefore he knew that he had not a light within him, as a sufficient safe guide to lead him into the way everlasting.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> In this thou hast said more of the light within each per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son then thou hast heard the Quakers say of it; for thou hast here affirmed, <hi>that the light in each person is an inward work of the Spirit,</hi> and thou hast made it to be more inward, spiritual, and effectual then thou hast made the Gospel to be; for the Gospel thou sayest, <hi>is but the word brought to your ears without you, and by m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But where didst thou learn those revilings against the Light, or from what sort of thy diverse Truths doth those words proceed from, seeing thou sayest there is two sorts of Truth? <hi>Metaphysick</hi> Truth, and <hi>Logick</hi> and <hi>Moral</hi> Truth, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is Christ another Truth then those, seeing the Scripture mentioneth no such name as <hi>Metaphysick, Logick</hi> and <hi>Moral</hi> Tru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Answ.</hi> The light of the day comprehends thee, and sees all thy works and words; and seest thou hast lost thy wisdom and understanding of the light which the day brings forth, and so though thou light thy candles in foolishness, yet thou cannot burn the day light, although thou strive to do it; but thou mayest read in the Scripture, <hi>that a fool when he holdeth his peace, is count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wise, and he that shutteth his lips, is esteemed a man of understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Prov.</hi> 17.28. So if thou hadst learned to be wise thou wouldest have been silent from that which thou hast preached in thy nine Sermons, which is but sparks of thy own kindling, or candles of thy own lighting, the end whereof is to burn day-light which is arisen, and hath shined forth and cannot be quenched by all thy candles, doctrines, nor arguments; for it is as impossible for thee to quench or hinder the shining of that light which is now risen, as for thee to light a candle, and thereby quench the light of the Sun in the natural day; and so that Scripture is true unto thee before cited, for if thou hadst been silent, people would have esteemed thee a man of more understanding, although inwardly thou hadst been the same, but not outwardly so made manifest as thou art.</p>
            <p>Again, thou tellest us of thy <hi>enjoyments,</hi> page 32. saying, <hi>that the best enjoyments or best habitation here, is no better then lying upon a bed of Thorns, or on the Mast of a Ship, where winds, storms, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual tossings take away all rest.</hi>

He was sent to turn them from dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to Light, and from the power of Satan unto God; so that although there was a Light which was sufficient, and the power of God was sufficient, yet they must be turned to it, and obey it, or else they were not saved by it; but Christ was a sufficient Light given of the Father for a light &amp; a guide to the Jews and Gentiles, before the Apostles preached him; but thy questions are as if thou shouldest say, If Christ or his Light be sufficient, and if he did come into the World both to <hi>Jews</hi> and Gentiles, why need any preaching, or bid others to obey and follow him, seeing he is sufficient? the Apostles did not preach another Light than that which had already ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared before they preached, and that which had enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every man come into the World; and they said that all the Nations of them that are saved, must walk in his Light; and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61974:55"/>
so though the Light was come, and also preached, yet none by it was saved, but they which did receive, believe and walk in it, and for that end was it preached in the World.</p>
               <p>Qu. 6. <hi>Why do the</hi> Quakers <hi>ge up and down teaching man their own Doctrines, if all men have sufficient light already?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans,</hi> The ground of the Query is false; for the <hi>Quakers</hi> do not go up and down teaching men their own doctrines, but do teach men the Way of God plainly, and do instruct the ignorant, and him that is out of the Way, and do turn men to that Light which is sufficient to lead them to God, and which will lead them from all Hirelings who make merchandize of souls, bodies and estates of men for their dishonest gain; and this Light of Christ (by which men are enlightened) doth justifie us in our going up and down in teaching men to deny all ungodliness, and all the Worlds lusts with which many are defiled, and in which many are kept by those who deny the Light, and speak evil of it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> You are in darkness, because you hate the Light; and while you do so, your deeds are evil, and we cannot but cry against you, as Christ and his Ministers did against those who were haters of the light; and what thougst the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Qu. 8. <hi>Will they pray for more Light and Grace, or not? if not, they are impiously proud; if yea, thin it seems they have not yet Light and Grace sufficient.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The Lord said unto <hi>Paul, My Grace is sufficient for thee</hi>; and yet <hi>Paul</hi> prayed for more grace, and was not impiously proud, as thou hast charged us; and the Apostle said, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.8. God is able to make all grace abound towards you, that ye al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways having all sufficiency, may abound, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that these <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> had sufficiency of grace, and yet were to abound, and they were not impiously proud in praying for more. And though this to thee be a Mysterie, yet to us it is plain truth; and vve are no more guilty in this then the Saints vvere.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The light is sufficient, and hath sufficient power in it to make men obedient if received and obeyed, yet by the power of self no man either receives or obeys it, but the command is of it, &amp; the power from it by which men do believe and obey; so that though this be a Mysterie and Parable to the Ignorant, yet it is plain to him that understands the leadings and power which is in the Light.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The ground of this Query is ignorance, to ask how can any Light be sufficient to reveal that which is not manifested by it; to manifest is to reveal; but for thee to say, how can it reveal that which is not revealed by it, is non-sence: And whoever hath affi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And whereas thou thinkest its past controversie, that no man hath sufficient Grace for Salvation till his last breath; by
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61974:56"/>
this thou wilt make it without controversie that the Scripture is false, and not to be believed; which Scripture if thou want, what hast thou more then the Heathens in <hi>America,</hi> but rather a great deal less: Had not the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> sufficient Grace when the Lord said, <hi>My Grace is sufficient for thee,</hi> 2 Cor. 12.9. And had not the <hi>Corinthians</hi> sufficiency of Grace, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. whose sufficiency was in God, and from God to them made manifest; and had not they sufficiency in all things, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.8. And was <hi>Paul</hi> with those <hi>Corinthians</hi> at the last breath, when those things were spoken; but thy thoughts have deceived thee, in thinking such a thing to be past controversie; for thou must be both controverted and contradicted, while thou thus in thy extreams and floods of fury, sets thy self against the Truth, as it is made manifest in us, and also in the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>Again thou saist, <hi>Thou thinks it is time for men that have any sence of the common interest of Christianity</hi> &amp; <hi>Reformation, to lay by these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions that hav brought you so low, &amp; almost made you a prey to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> Romish <hi>Adversaries,</hi> (saying) <hi>the Lord grant it be not too late.</hi>

And although thou confessest, that you are brought low by contention, and by too eager dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, yet again thou exalts thy self and thy Brethren, as if you were above Christ or his Apostles in the Work of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry; for thou saist, How few did Christ convert, that spake as never man spake? And how many places did the Apostles preach in, where they converted not one for a hundred that some of you see converted in one Parish.

which ever thou hast preached, hath not converted one in thy Parish into the State of a new creature, where all old things are done away, and all things are become new, and so thy boasting thereby may be ended.</p>
               <p>Again thou saist, That you do not fear that quaking should become the Nations Religion, we know those squibs will soon be out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> If it were but a squib that would so soon be out, what need you make so much a do about it, and bring forth so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny floods, and draw dry so many wells to quench it? And what is the cause of such jealousies in your hearts as sometime to fear that it's too late to strive against it?

Not those who have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned his Light, and reproached the children of it; not those who preach for filthy lucre, who serve not the Lord Jesus Christ, but their own bellies, who make merchandize of souls for dishonest gain; but he that walketh righteously, and speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth uprightly, he that despiseth the gain of oppression, that shaketh his hands from holding of bribes, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil, such a one loveth the appearance of him who is come a Light into the World, and loveth the children that walk in his Light; for he that loveth him that doth beget, loveth also those that are begotten of him, who walk in his Light; but the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed shall become silent in darkness; and many who have used their tongues, and said, <hi>Come Lord Jesus, come quickly,</hi> shall not be able to stand when he appears, nor to abide the day of his coming, which to them that hate him, is destruction; but to them that love him, is everlasting salvation.

He preached to the World with Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, that every man in him might believe; and they that believe might not perish, but have everlasting life in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; and they that believed not in him who had enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, was condemned already; and here was authority in his doctrine, which the Pharisees had not in their doctrine, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.18. for they knew not the Light which Christ had enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every one withal, which they that believed not in it, were already condemned with it; and so their doctrine stood not in that which did save and condemn, and so it was not in the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Spirit, as the doctrine of the Teachers of the World is now, out of the authority, not turning people from darkness to light, which if they do not believe, is condemned already.

                  </gap>lf than us, and more confuted himself than us, as will appear in that which followeth.</p>
               <p>As first, in his Epistle directed to the Protector, the honor which God will not give to another than Christ, hath he given to another from Christ, and so denied the Power and Work of the Son of God as Mediator, saying; <hi>That the Magistrate is an Officer of Jesus Christ as Mediator, in his Political Kingdom.</hi> And he saith also in the same Epistle, <hi>That the Magistrate must not be an Officer in the spiritual Kingdom of his Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which I answer, Christ hath not a Political and a Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Kingdom; for the Kingdom of Christ the Heir of God, is but one, which stands in righteousness; <hi>My Kingdom is not of this World,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>John</hi> 18 36. Now <hi>Clapham</hi> confesseth, That the Magistrate is no Officer of Christ's spiritual Kingdom, of his Church. Now to say that Christ hath a spiritual Kingdom, and a Kingdom of Policy, or Political Kingdom, is blasphemy against the Son of God, and wil be taken notice of by the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Powers. And to say, That the Magistrate is an Officer of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ as Mediator, is blasphemy also; for what Magistrate in this Nation, or what Priest or people (besides thee) dare own any to be joined with Christ as Mediator? Was there ever any such a thing heard from any that professe to know the Scripture, to tell of Christ having a Political Kingdom, in which the Magistrate must be an Officer, but not in the spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Kingdom of his Church? Then why dost thou so often in thy Book press the Magistrate to exercise his Power to defend the Church, as thou callest it? This thy confusion I lay open for the peoples sake, that they may be wiser than their Teachers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:61974:60"/>Again, the Priest saith, <hi>That Christ is the eternal Son of God, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct from the Father eternally, &amp;c.</hi> And, <hi>that the Spirit was distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished from the Father and Son from eternity</hi>; as in page 17. of his Book; and <hi>that there is three Substances, and but one Divine Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Here thou hast shewed thy self to be brutish in thy knowledge, and to have no more understanding than a Beast which perisheth. Therefore let all People take notice, that Priest <hi>Clapham</hi> hath exhorted to try mens doctrines by the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture; therefore by the Scriptures he is charged to prove any such thing, as that the Son of God is distinct from the Father eternally, or that the Spirit was distinguished eternally from both the Father and the Son. Now this I also affirm, that the Devil which did not abide in the Truth, he is separated and distinguished from the Father eternally; but so is not the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Son of God, for he is in him, <hi>John</hi> 17.11. <hi>John</hi> 17.21, 22. And again I say, False Prophets and Hirelings are from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and from Eternity distinguished from the Father and the Son; but so is not the Spirit of Truth: So I leave it to that of God in all people, that with it they may see and know which to believe; for Christ saith, <hi>I and my Father are one</hi>; and he is not Christ without God. Therefore that damnable doctrine is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, which saith, That Christ the Eternal Son of God is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished from the Father eternally. For few in this Nation are so blind (besides Priest <hi>Clapham)</hi> as either to affirm or believe such a thing; or that there is three Subsistences, and but one being: Is not a Subsistence a Being? Therefore if any other of the Priesthood in <hi>Norfolk</hi> have joined with <hi>Clapham</hi> in his Book, or do own him in these things, cover your faces toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and be ashamed that your impudency and blindnesse do not lead you any more to blaspheme.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>Clapham</hi> saith concerning the soul, in pag. 21<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>That the soul came indeed from God, but was not of the Being of God; and that the soul is humane</hi>: And when I asked him, <hi>Whether the soul was not immortal?</hi> He said, <hi>Yea, Humane and Immortal were both one.</hi> To this I answer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Wo is unto that people whose Leader is a fool, blind and ignorant of God, of the Son of God, and of the soul of man, &amp; of the <hi>Scriptures</hi> what they speak concerning these things
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61974:61"/>
Now if humane and immortal be both one, then every man that is come into the World, hath a humane body, then the bodies of all men that are come into the World, are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal as well as the soul. But for your sakes who are led by such, I say, The first <hi>Adam</hi> was made a living soul, the second <hi>Adam</hi> was made a quickening spirit, 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 15.45. And you all have a Light from the second <hi>Adam,</hi> with it to see what the soul is, which was made living, and how again by Christ the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening Spirit, it comes to be restored into the same Life; and with the Light of Christ you will see the soul, and see the Life which from Christ is manifest to quicken it up to the living God; and so then you will know the Scriptures, and the power of God, and that the Scriptures speak not of a humane soul.</p>
               <p>Now the Ministers of Christ which are sent to turn people from darkness to l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ght, and from the power of a Satan unto God, they are to watch over the souls of those who are turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Light; therefore you all in the Light wait to knovv the soul, and know the power of God which raiseth it up out of the death, and then you will be wiser than your Teachers, as <hi>David</hi> was; and then you wil not come short of the promises which the Father hath promised, even the sure mercies of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid.</hi> So in the Light all who wait upon God, come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Son of God, and of the Soul, which is to be watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over, and then you come to that which is sure, even to the knowledge as <hi>David</hi> did, over all your Teachers; and so you wil come to know the key of <hi>David,</hi> which will open unto you that which is sealed up from your Teachers, and so come to know the one shepherd, and the one sheepfold, and the green pastures as <hi>David</hi> fed in; and then you wil not need the Priests meanings, being wiser then they, you having the key of knowledg, which they and the Lawyers have lost, as Christ hath said, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23 13. shutting up the Kingdom of Heaven against men, and from men now, as the Pharisees did then; so that you need not say, there were such then; but where are there now any such? I shall shew you one; as <hi>John Clapham</hi> in the 37. page of his Book saith, That Heaven is not to be enjoyed vvhile vve be in the flesh here. Novv see vvhether he hath not shut it up from all men vvhile they are here: But Christ vvho vvas annointed of the Father to preach the Gospel to the poor, said not so; for
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:61974:61"/>
he said unto his Disciples, Blessed are ye poor in spirit, for yours is the Kingdom of Heaven, <hi>Luke</hi> 6.20 <hi>Mat.</hi> 5 3. it was theirs, and they did enjoy it; neither did Christ shut it from the Pharises, but said unto them, <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven is within you,</hi> Luke 17.21. And if they had believed his words, they might have enjoyed and been Heirs of it, as the believers were. And the Ministers of Christ were to preach as they went, saying, <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand</hi>; and so they were not to shut it up from men, as the Hypocrites did and false Teachers, which say, It cannot be enjoyed while men are here. And here it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that they shut up the Kingdom against men, and neither enter in themselves, nor suffer others, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.13. for if they entered in themselves, then they could not deny but that it might be enjoyed. And here is the Scripture fulfilled, <hi>Matt.</hi> 13.19. they shut up the Kingdom of Heaven against men, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, None can enjoy it here; but Heaven is God's Throne, and the Kingdom of Heaven is within you; and so here as God hath said, <hi>I will dwell in them, and walk in them, and they shall be my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and I will be their God.</hi> And the Seed of the Kingdom was sown, and was reaped amongst the Churches, and it was in them (that would not enter in it themselves, nor suffer others) as a grain of Mustard-seed, and in others it was as Leaven hid in three measures of Meal. And so the Kingdom was preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Gospel in every creature, and there were parables of the Kingdom, and the World had it in the Parables in them; but they that did believe, had it in them, in the power, in the power, out of the parable: He that hath an ear, let him hear what the power speaks, then shall be witnessed that vvhich is written both of the Povver and of the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Again, the said <hi>Clapham</hi> hath charged God and Christ falsly in his Book, as that Christ dwells in his people tvvo vvays; first by his special spiritual presence. Secondly, By mystical union, and that is more than the former; bringing this comparison, <hi>That one may dwell in a House, and have no union with it</hi>; and saith, That God dvvells in the Heavens, but hath no union vvith them; and that the union betvven God and believers cannot be comprehended by the Saints here as in the 24<hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:61974:62"/>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Now let all take notice, and with the measure that God hath given you, to judge whether Christ can dwell in his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by his special presence, and have no unity with them, as he hath affirmed. And again, judge whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>her a mystical union be more then his special presence, as he hath affi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>med. And again, consider that Heaven is God's Throne and the place of his rest. And whether God can dwell in the Heavens, and have no uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with them, with his own Throne, and with the place of his rest. And consider whether there was ever such a doctrine preached or believed among the sons of men from <hi>Abel</hi> unto this day; there is no record of such a Doctrine, neither in the Scriptures, Histories, Heathens, Pagans, nor others; therefore it is now fit to be recorded or put in Chronicle, that all may see what a doctrine is crept into the World, and that all may see that Night is come upon all such Prophets, that they have no vision nor knowledge of God nor his wayes. And this is the man that hath set himself to oppose and gainsay the truth, and is a daily reproacher of those that walk in it, yet professeth himself to be a Minister of Christ; and those whose hearts are upright towards God, is he reviling, comparing them to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, Hereticks, Scribes and Pharises, Indians, and such like; but to none of those in these things before-mentioned, neither to Scribe, Pharisee, Pope, Turk, Indian, or Alcaron, can he be compared; for they have been all restrained by something of God in them, from writing so blasphemously against God, and Christ, and the Holy Ghost, the Soul, Heaven and Union, and the Saints, as he hath done: And so this is another Gospel than that which was preached by Christ and his Apostles, and so by the Spirit of God to be accursed for ever.</p>
               <p>And whereas he saith, That the union between God and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, cannot be comprehended by the Saints here, he char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges a lye upon the Saints, and speaks contrary to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.7. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.15. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.20. for the Saints did wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse union with God here; for he that sanctified, and they that are sanctified, were one; they said they were of God, and the whole World lyeth in wickedness; &amp; as he is, so are we in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent World; &amp; they comprehend with all <hi>Saints</hi> the heighth, and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61974:62"/>
length and the breadth of the love of God, while they are in the world. Now whoever would have believed it, that the teachers in <hi>England</hi> had been so blind, or durst have spoken so contrary to the Scriptures? they professing them so much to be their rule, and learning so long, and studying so much to get the Letter of them, but now is found both out of the Letter and Life; but now the day of God is risen in his peoples hearts, and they are seen to be such before their books come forth: and now that which they were judged to be before they published them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in print, comes forth; that all the world may see that the judgment of God is true from his servants, upon them, and that all the Rulers of the Nation may see that such are not fit to be held up, but be cried against; and if any should by a Law give such the tenth parts of mens estates, they may expect that by the righteous Law of God ten parts of theirs may be taken away and given to strangers; so if any people maintain this doctrine, they maintain that which the curse of God comes upon, and if they come not out from it, will be partakers of the plague.</p>
               <p>And again, as concerning Hell, <hi>Clapham</hi> saith, <hi>that men are not in Hell while they are upon earth.</hi> And here is another lye.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The Prophet said while he was upon earth, <hi>thou hast redeemed my soul out of hell</hi>; and <hi>Jonah</hi> said, <hi>Out of the belly of hell cryed I unto thee,</hi> and so the believers doctrine was contrary to <hi>Claphams</hi>; for they knew both heaven and hell while they were upon earth, and a redeeming out of the one into the other by Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>Again, he accuseth <hi>Peter,</hi> saying, <hi>that he speaks of the divine Nature being communicated to the Saints, but understands divine graces.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The Apostle doth not speak one thing and understand another as the Priests do, for he speaks with the Spirit, and with understanding, and knows how to divide the word of God aright, who spoke unto them that had escaped the corruption, which is in the world through lust, and knew what it was to be partakers of the divine nature; but herein the wickedness of this Priest is manifest, who would keep people from being made partakers of the divine Nature, and would shut up the kingdom of heaven from men while they are upon earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:61974:63"/>Again, he accuseth the <hi>Corinthians</hi> in the 33. page of his book, to be the ancient Hereticks who were baptized for the dead.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Those who were baptized for the dead was no Hereticks, neither did they deny the resurrection of the dead, though <hi>Paul</hi> said, <hi>How say some among you, that there is no Resurrection of the dead?</hi> yet he did not call those that were baptised for the dead, Hereticks; for those that were baptised for the dead and stood in jeopardy every hour, did believe the resurrection of the dead, and did wait for it, and did not deny it as <hi>Clapham</hi> saith, who hath proceeded on in his book, with many of the like false accusations against us also: but it is a small matter for us to be judged by such a one, for herein is but Christs words fulfilled, <hi>As they have done unto me, so shall they do unto you</hi>: for neither Christ nor the Apostles, nor the Church of God hath escaped his accusation; for (Luk. 6.26.) <hi>Wo unto you,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>when all men speak well of you, for so did they of the false Prophets; but blessed are you when men shall speak all manner of evil against you, falsly for my names sake, for great shall your reward be in heaven</hi>: now though against us all manner of evil be spoken falsly in the Book before mentioned, yet in truth do we stand out of it all, and over it all, and our accuser is found in the evil, and vve clear.</p>
               <p>And as for the 13. Sect. wherein he hath wearied himself for very vanity, hath he proved nothing against us, but against him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; in which he hath said that we are enemies to the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and deny Christ come in the flesh, also his death and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, and that we have said that Christs flesh perished, and that we own not the man Christ in the Heavens, as <hi>pag.</hi> 11. and chargeth us to say, that he did not ascend into heaven, is not at the right hand of God, shall not come to judge the world. <hi>pag.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>Whereas</hi> Clapham <hi>saith we deny prayer, the Lords Supper, and Water-baptism, and giving of thanks at meals, and singing of Psalms.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> This is false, as his own writing and confession will witness against him, which in a former Letter said, that I prayed three times at one Meeting, and now in this book saith we deny prayer. Here confusion is grown into impudency, and lyes are made his proofs. Again, he saith we deny the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:61974:63"/>
my flesh, and drink my blood, ye have no life in you.</hi> And this is his Supper, in eating of which the creature hath life in himself. Therefore fly from idolatry; I speak unto wise men, judge what I say; the cup of blessing which we bless, is the Communion of the blood of Christ; and the bread which we break, is the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the body of Christ: <hi>For we being many are one bread and one body, for we are all partakers of that one bread,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.14, 15, 16, 17. <hi>For the bread of God is he that came down from Heaven, and giveth life unto the World,</hi> John 6.33. <hi>Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread; and Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life, he that cometh to me shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hunger, and he that believeth on me shall never thirst,</hi> John 6.34, 35. <hi>I am the living bread which came down from heaven, if any man eat of this bread he shall live for ever; and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world</hi> v. 51. <hi>But the Jews could not belive this,</hi> neither can this Priest, but saith we own fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And many such are in this generation; and are as <hi>Job</hi> did see that such have light though they walk not in the paths of it; nor known at the ways of it, because they hate it, but to the light in such are we made manifest, and it shall witness us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, And such as were fools, and scorners, and vvithout understanding, the Lord bids them return at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, them vvho did hate knovvledge, and said, I vvill pour out my spirit upon you, and make knovvn my vvords unto you; but they hated knovvledge, and did not chuse the fear of the Lord, they vvould none of Gods counsels, but despised all his reproof, therefore saith God, they shall eat of the fruit of their

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Faith hath but one foundation; and all who are belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, their foundation is established upon Christ, who is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of Faith, before any Scripture was written; <hi>Jacob, Enoch, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, Isaac,</hi> had no Scriptures written to establish their faith upon; and when <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets had known, seen and believed, and from that wrote of him who was the true light, enlightning every one, that in him very one might believe; so every one, whether they have the writings of the Prophets and Apostles or not, yet they have that in which they are to believe, which if they believe not is condemned, and believing in the light, they come to be the children of the light; and here the first prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple comes to be known of faith; and so the first principle of the doctrine of Christ must be known, before the doctrine be profest, and so all who know not the first principle of faith,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:61974:68"/>
are far from the saith; and who knows not the first principle of the doctrine, is far from a doctrine; and so the principle of a thing must be known before the thing; but the Scripture speaks of nothing that the Christian faith is to be established upon, but upon Christ who was glorified with the Father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world was; by whom all things which now are, were made, who hath given us of his spirit: and to us it is given to believe and suffer for his names sake, as it was given those who were his true witnesses before us, and they did believe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was given them to believe by the spirit; so faith is the gift of God, and many have the Scriptures which have not faith, which is the gi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thus having laid before the people some of those things with which his book is filled, and for this end do I lay them open, that those for whom Christ died, and unto whom his love is reached forth to bring them to the Father, should not be corrupted with the unsound form of doctrine delivered unto them by their Priest: And again as followeth, I shall lay down some particulars which he hath held forth as affirmed principles in his book, which if you receive his testimony, you must believe as your principles also; but if you come to try them with the measure of the light that Christ hath enlightned them withal, then you will deny both him and them: therefore mark them as followeth,</p>

               <p>IN thy former Book thou hast been proved to deny the Father, Son, and Spirit; and denied that there is any thing in thee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove nature: And in this book also thou hast made it manifest to be guided only by the naturall senses, and so to be sensuall, having not the Spirit: and so in this thy sensual wisdom without the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, thou goest about to prove us to be the Harlot, and to be upon two dangerous designs; the first by our Doctrine, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond by the Sword.

                     <desc>•</desc>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>; but their design in their Doctrine was, to exalt Christ, which is the true light, and lighteneth every one that cometh into the World, and our design is the same, against which no inchantments, lyes, nor fals accusations from Priest or Atheists can prevail.</p>
               <p>The second particular wherein thou would prove us to be the Harlot, and our design to be dangerous, is, because we say, That <hi>Christ lighteneth every one that cometh into the world.</hi> And to this thou thy self in the fifth page of thy Book confessest to be a truth cleere from Scripture; and that this light discovers to every one (that will) both good and evill: and in the fourth page thou callest this particular, <hi>That Christ hath lightened every one that comes into the World,</hi> a pure truth; and yet thou would make the people believe that we were the Harlot for holding forth the pure truth; and so thy own breath as fire shall devou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s doctrine cannot make the people so blind as to believe that holding forth the pure truth of God, will make us to be an Harlot, or our design dangerous,: and here thou hast manifested <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hy spirit, that all may see what we are accused for, and by whom, being accused to be harlots, hereticks, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers and deluders, blasphemous and dangerous, because we hold forth the pure truth of God according to the Scriptures; ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, so far hath God turned the wise backwards, and made their wisdom foolishnesse, that even our enemies and accusers are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to confesse, that it is holden forth to the pure truth according to the Scripture, for which we are accused, as <hi>T. Winterton</hi> hath done, to his owne shame and confusion.</p>
               <p>The third particular from which thou would prove us to be the harlot, and our designs dangerous, are in these words, which thou sayest thou gathered from our Doctrine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That whatsoever believers in this light, it is as a fire and a hammer to break and consume all carnall lust, and fleshly and selfish desires whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that now they cannot sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Here thou hast gathered that which we have not strewen,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:61974:72"/>
and in thy imaginations thou hast gathered thy evill thoughts, conceiving of that which never was spoken from us as thou speakest it, <hi>and now they cannot sin.</hi> But this I say, that he that believeth in the light, and follows Christ who is the light, shall have the light of life, and shall never come into condemnation, if he abide in the light which comes from Christ, the Word which is as a fire and a hammer, which where it dwels consumes all carnall and fleshly lusts. And hereby it is easily known who have the word, from them who have but the letter. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as thou sayest that light is but to discover, and not active at all; here thou hast shewed thy self to be ignorant, both of the light and of the Scripture, which saith the light of Israel shall be for a fire, and it shall burn up and devour his thorns and bryers in one day. And this light was witnessed to burn and consume that which is contrary to it: and whereas thou sayest, that if we will be purged, we must seek somthing else, for light will not doe it. I answer, God is light, as in 1 <hi>John,</hi> 1.5. and Christ is the light, <hi>John</hi> 8.12. and if God and Christ who is the light, will not do it, then what else must people seeke unto to be purged? And again thou sayst, thou deniest that light or any thing within man or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out man, doth or ever did so cleanse, purifie and make perfect the souls of men: and then thou addest, to make up thy darke saying, as that it were safe and convenient to allow them no other guide or director but the dictates of their own light &amp; spirit within them: As for the latter thou mayst take it to thine own, for we deny all those which walks after their owne, whether thou call it light or dictates, for that which is their own is darknesse, and not light; but those that follow the light of Christ, and deny that which is their owne for his sake we owne. And as for thy former, to deny that light, or any thing within or without man, doth or ever did cleanse or purifie and make perfect the sons of men; let all here take notice of thy Atheisme, who hath denied Christ and his light either either within or without men to do it.</p>
               <p>The fourth particular by which thou would prove us to be the Harlot, and our designes dangerous, is in these words, <hi>That now the Scripture is no more a guide for us to walk by, nor nothing without them, but the light within them, and that seeks after any other guide but that within him, is in the flesh still.</hi> Which words are thy one, and was not so spoken by any of us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:61974:72"/>But to thee I say, that the Scripture which did foresee that which we now do see, we owne to be one with the light which was before the letter, and to be our guide in the way of truth: and this guide is within us; but by the Scripture letter without thee, thou nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sees nor foresees the things which belong to eternal life, which if ever any come to see, it must be by the light of Christ within them; and all who own this light, and with it is guided, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny the Scriptures which was spoken forth from the light within.</p>
               <p>Again thou wouldest accuse <hi>E. B.</hi> to be changing in his doctrine from one thing to another, because he said, that all strife and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and revenge, was of the flesh, and of the Divel, and to be condemned with the light: which testimony is also true, and this testimony can we never deny nor change from. And whereas thou bringest his salutation to contradict that, where he saith, <hi>Make war in righteousnesse against Gog and Magog, and prepare for the Lord.</hi> Herein thou hast manifested thy blindness, which cannot see the war which stands in righteousnesse, from that which proceeds from the lust: but as thou hast imagined carnally of all the things of God which was spoken from the same spirit: and so as well may thou make lyes, and pervert our words, as thou dost the Scriptures: and now having published many lyes against us, thou makest a professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thy own condition, that all people may see fro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> what thou judgest us to be in delusion; thy words are these: <hi>Now forasmuch as I have not an infall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Thy now leaving of us to better judgments, or to them that have the spirit of truth, will not excuse thee for what thou hast done already, that hath had nothing to judge us by all this while, (that thou hast spoken and written against us) but evill conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences out of thy imaginary faculty. How art thou fallen from what thou seemedst to pretend against us in thy books! as if thou hadst known that we had held forth false Doctrine, or inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a carnall war, because we spake of a war <hi>in righteousnesse.</hi> But now thou speakest plainly, that thou hast not the spirit of Truth, truly to interpret what we intend in our expressions; but
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:61974:73"/>
leeves it to better judgments: Here thou hast manifested thy self a foolish builder; it had been lesse shame for thee if thou hadst not begun, then having begun in thy imaginary faculties and bad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences, and now confessest thou wantest the spirit of Truth; here thou hast proved thy selfe to be the Harlot, and fit to be cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed out of the Citie, who doth raise strife, accusations and lyes against the truth of God from thy imaginary faculties and bad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, being without the spirit of truth. Again, in thy answer to <hi>E. B.</hi> salutation, thou boasts from thy imaginary faculty, and sayst in thy 11. page, <hi>O thou proud presumptuous, ambitious Quaker, whence is thy originall? thou art not yet seven yeares old, and art thou the only people of the whole creation, in the favour of the Almighty! therefore woe be to them that live to see thee prosperous to a manly age.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Our original is before all ages, or the number of years, and before any imaginary faculties (which is thy rule) was, and this in time being brought forth, which before all times was, they who are found in their imaginary faculties, as thou art, the woe comes upon them; and thy woe and torment will increase, as the truth increaseth; as it was from Christ to the Jewes, Scribes and Pharises, in the dayes of his flesh, who questioned the truth of his word from the youngnesse of his yeares, as thou dost his truth now, having nothing to judg with but thy imaginary fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, having nothing of infallible spirit, and yet thou goes on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusing us, that we deny all matter and form of worship. <hi>I</hi> say, where the spirit of truth is, which thou sayst thou hast not, there is both the matter and form of the true worship owned, and not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied; which spirit we have, and know both the matter and form: but in thy imaginary faculties there is neither. And whereas thou sayest, that we deny actuall obedience, and the authority of the Scriptures; that is false: for by that authority that gave forth the Scriptures, are we daily in actuall obedience to the Lord. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, thou bringest several particulars, which thou callest the markes of the Harlot by which she may be known: as first, in her language, which is to speak the word <hi>Thou</hi> to a particular person in stead of <hi>You,</hi> thou wouldest make the language of the Harlot; then all the Prophets, Christ and the Apostles, did speak the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the Harlot; and then the Scripture is translated in the language of the Harlot, which doth not use the word <hi>You</hi> to any
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:61974:73"/>
particular person. But here thou hast made it more manifest to be without the spirit, and to speak from thy imaginary fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties.</p>
               <p>The second mark is her weapons, which is, saying that people is carnall, and in the flesh, and that they know not the light of Christ, but stumble at the stumbling-stone, and are in the cursed ground, and that they cannot believe though the truth be declared unto them, they having not the spirit, but are in their sins. And this thou sayest is the weapon of the Harlot.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Now these words were all used by the Ministers of the most high God against the Harlot, as thou art manifest to be, who stumbles at the stumbling-stone as it is written, <hi>Romans</hi> 9.32. <hi>John,</hi> 11.9, 10. Here thou may see they which were no harlots told them they stumble at the stumbling-stone, and told some that they were carnall, 1 <hi>Corinthians.</hi> 3.3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Prophets told them they had eyes and could not see, eares and could not hear, and hearts and could not understand, <hi>Isaiah,</hi> 44.18. and this was no marke of a Harlot in the Prophet; but they whom he said was so, was Harlotted from the Lord, and Christ told them, that they were yet in their sins, and told them they should die in their sins, <hi>John</hi> 8.24. if they bel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eved not, and told them they were of their father the Divell, and had not known God, but was from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, <hi>John,</hi> 8. And these thing in Christ was no marke of a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot, but they were harlots whom he so Judged, and so thy marks discover thee.</p>
               <p>The third mark, Her presumption, attempting to share with the Almighty. And this which thou calls presumption, is to be guided by God; and hereby thou doth accuse all the Saints of God, for they all did so far presume as to be guided by God and by his spirit, and to say that all the children of the Lord should be taught of the Lord, and this was no presumption, nor no mark of the harlot, and they said, as he, is so are wee in this present World: and this was no presumption, nor the marke of the harlot, but humility; if thou were not blind thou would see it.</p>
               <p>The fourth mark is, pretending to own the Scriptures, and speak much of Religion, and yet have nothing in matter, form, or essence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> This hath marked out thy condition, that pretends to owne the Scriptures, and professeth them, and hath not that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:61974:74"/>
which gave them forth, being guided by the imaginary facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and so without the power and effect of that which thou pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth: but we by that spirit which gave them forth, do them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, and have the form, power, and effect, of what we doe profess; and so the mark of the harlot returns upon thy self, which is to presume without the spirit.</p>
               <p>The first mark, her attendance; the ignorant and the lewd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> If this be the mark of the Harlot, try thy selfe; for who is more ignorant than he that wants the infallible spirit, as thou confesseth thou dost? For this marke of the harlot thou cleares us from in the sixth page of thy book, who there accuseth us of subtilty: and in the 16 page, of ignorance; and so thou multiplies thy confusion and ignorance. And for lewdnesse, thou may own the guilt of that thine self: for if thou were not both lewd and mad in thy divinations thou would not have so false accused those that have the spirit of God, confessing thy self not to have it; but that it is that thy folly may more speedily be made manifest unto all men, that the Scripture upon thee may be fulfilled.</p>
               <p>The sixth mark, her kinred, and thats the Ranters, which thou sayest is the mark of the Harlot.</p>
               <p>Herein thou hast numbred thy self, thy own testimony being a witnesse to it, and thy guide which is thy naturall senses, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt reason, knowing neither light nor spirit of Christ within, and therefore no restraint thou knows from thy divers lusts, but both the Ranters and thou in your sensuall liberty is found, and by us you are both denyed; for from that kinred we are redeemed, and from all harlots marks.</p>
               <p>The seventh mark is, she is the youngest of all Harlots, little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove five yeares old.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> If thou would prove us to be the Harlot from the young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of years, as little above five, then thou must deny that which thou hast asserted against us in the 13. page; for there thou would prove us to be false Prophets from those fruits that Christ spoke of <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.15. And if thou prove any thing against us from that in <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. then it is not from the yongnesse of years; for that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove five yeares since: so these confusions I return unto thee again, that thou may see that blindnesse and confusion is the signe of the Harlot.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> To determine any thing before the Lord, argues dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in the understanding: But what he reveals in the Spirit of Faith, and leads unto by his light, and not by the sensual under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing; and for want of this consideration have many been possessed with a strong confidence of a certainty; and not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving found their ends therein, have turned back again into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, ready to conclude there is no God, because he would not answer their imagination, who determined things in their own wills, before the guidings of his Spirit; and see if hereof thou be not guilty.</p>

to</hi> Damascus? <hi>And whether</hi> Sauls <hi>conversion to a Christian, and</hi> John Lilburns <hi>resolving to a Quaker, be upon one and the same ground</hi>?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> That <hi>John Lilburn</hi> was confident in his Religion, is plain; else had he not so long been deceived; and that God owned him in opposing many of the unjust Powers of the Nation, is as plain; else had not he lived to have been converted; and that the ground thereof is the same wherewith <hi>Paul</hi> was converted, is as evident as the rest, to them that are in the Light, and out of the imaginations; and your envy to him since he owned the truth, is no small Testimony of it; and so all things testifying toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Tree will be known by its fruits to them that are not blind.</p>
               <p n="10">10. <hi>Whethee God did not convey this new Light or Dispensation to</hi> Sauls <hi>understanding through his sences, in that it is said he heard and saw, as a sure ground to build his faith upon?

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Here thou hast manifested that thou art blind and in confusion; for the ground of faith is but one in <hi>Paul</hi> and those that were converted; and this ground of faith is not of man, nor conveyed from one man to another, but it is the gift of God, and Christ is the Author of it. In thy Query thou art speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Light in which he heard and saw, being the ground of <hi>Pauls</hi> Faith, and the signs and wonders wrought by <hi>Paul,</hi> being a sure ground to convey faith to the people: If thou were not blind, thou wouldest see, that in <hi>Paul</hi> and the people the ground of Faith is but one; and they that believed because of the Miracles, their Faith as thine, doth stand in that which is changeable, and is not from the true ground; but those whom <hi>Paul</hi> preached unto, he told them, that the Word of Faith was within them: The Word which he preached, and the Light was in them, and so he was to turn them to the Light and to the Word which was within them. And whereas thou asks, Whether it was not conveyed through the senses to the understanding: First learn to know where it is, and what it doth enlighten in thee, and then thou wilt know what is convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

through; for as yet in thee thy senses are ignorant of it, though it shine in darkness.</p>
               <p n="11">11. <hi>Whether if</hi> John Lilburn <hi>have received the same ground of faith so conveyed to his understanding immediately from God, as</hi> Saul <hi>had, or by some other whom God hath endued with Power and Authority to convey a ground of Faith, as</hi> Paul <hi>did, then far be it from me for blaming of</hi> J. Lilburn <hi>for being a</hi> Quaker: <hi>Otherwise, whether if he have not received the ground of faith aforesaid, whether it be not easie to discern, that</hi> John Lilburn's <hi>Resurrection is but a meer imagination or Quaking Delusion</hi>?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Faith is the gift of God, and not the gift of <hi>Paul</hi>; and herein thou art blind: And Christ saith, Believe in the Light while ye have the Light; but he did not bid them believe in that which was of man, nor conveyed by men to one another: Yet thou confessest that it was conveyed to <hi>Paul</hi> immediately from God. Therefore seeing thou makest a difference, shew who did ever receive Faith, or the ground of it, and not from God, and what was the ground of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith, and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noch</hi>'s, before the Scripture-Letter was written: But the ground of <hi>John Lilburn</hi>'s Faith is immediately from God as <hi>Paul</hi>'s was; and therefore thou mayest cease blaming of him for his being turned to the Faith.</p>
               <p n="12">12. <hi>Whether it be not easie to find out whether the Quakers doctrine be a dispensation of God, or a dispensation of man's will? Whether if it be of God, he will not take the same care for the divulging of it, as he did of his former dispensation? that is, by such evidences as no false Minister could procure; as when he commanded his Apostles to preach to the world, and to baptize them that believed, and to teach them to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve all things, &amp;c.</hi>

now, as ever he did, is manifest even by such evidences as no false Minister can produce; for never any of the false Ministers which the Lord did not send, did turn any from their iniquity, nor from darkness to the light, nor from the power of Satan unto God, which now many do witness from the Ministry which God hath now raised up in this age, which is the torment o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then he seems to hint at the Cruelty and Outcry of many, for crying Club-law against the men called <hi>Quakers</hi>; but whether with approve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or otherwise of it, his mind is not uttered; however by the Lyes and Slanders ensuing out of his owne mouth, it is easily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that he is of that very generation of persecutors; though he so well do not approve of Persecuting with the hand, yet he allows, and himself is guilty of persenting with the tongue, which is one in nature; so that hereby the great hypocrisie, of this man appears, in condemning others secretly of what himself is guilty of openly; then he is pleased (though the Lord be vexed) to cast forth his peevish smite against the light of Jesus Christ, wherewith every man in the world is lighted, in words thus venomously uttered, that perverse Principle of their <hi>(viz Quakers</hi>) self-adoring light: Will the Protector and Council believe this, or will they promote him to honour or magnifie him, because of his opprobious speeches against the light of the Son of God? let them answer and testifie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, for blasphemy, who hath in his hastinesse uttered his envie and wickedness, and no less then denied the Lord that bought him, in calling, and shamelesly stiling the pure light of Christ, the Way, the Truth, and the Life, <hi>Perverse Principle,</hi> and <hi>Selfe adoring light</hi>: and thus it is manifest the Press is abused by such an Anti-scriptural, and Antichristian error, proceeding out of <hi>John Stel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> old heart, and manifested from his Pen; then with his lying Message he follows after his flattering titles, and sayes ere long the Lord himself will rebuke them (<hi>viz Quakers</hi>) to silence, that they shall neither write, nor speak so presumptuously &amp;c.

            <p>And further, <hi>J.

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:61974:80"/>
seemes to be the greatest burthen upon his evil heart, because truth is among them, &amp; if truth go on, his deceit wil be more made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, wither, and perish; and so as subtilly as may be he would defend himself in the sight of his Church that his shame may not appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them (it may be least his Hire should be abated) and he seems to cast a cloak upon them; but whether out of pure love to their Soules, or for his owne Gain, &amp; such a sum of Money, God knowes; how e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the least Child in the truth dwelling in the light, sees his length, and can measure his state, &amp; knows that good cannot come from an old lying heart, &amp; he speaks something of wondering after the beast and false Prophet, but hath not described what the Beast is, and the false Prophet: And I refer the Reader to a Book called <hi>The Measure of the Times:</hi> wherein the Priests of <hi>England,</hi> such as <hi>J. S.</hi> is reproved according to the Scripture, to be the very branches of the same Root of false Prophets which all the World wondered after in <hi>Johns</hi> time; &amp; though he speak much to his Church of Christ without, and of his birth, blood, and his righteousness, and justification thereby, &amp;c. but to all that, I say, All are Reprobates but such in whom Christ is within them, and none are justified but such, nor hath any part in the inheritance of God, though they may profess never so much of Christ without; and what he hath done for others, yet except he be within them too, to change and renew them, and give them power over all their sins, their profession of him is vain.</p>
            <p>I am no picker of Quarrels; else many of his words might be searched, which I run over hastily, knowing his voice to be the voice of a stranger, and not of Christ, who never made use of an old sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful heart to pen Epistles to Churches.</p>
            <p>But into this lets search; he saith, Christ blesseth Infants-Baptism: Where, or when, I aske proof of this, and till then I say <hi>J.S.</hi> hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyed Christ, and the generation of the just; Wel may he bely us, when he hath bely'd Christ, who could not ble<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>He speakes of a well ordered Conversation; Inded this seems Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie, to exhort others (their Churches) to that which many of the <hi>Independent</hi> Teachers have not thmselves, who are Hirelings, and takes Guifts, and Rewards for Preaching, and is in the way
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:61974:81"/>
of all the Deceivers of old; and they that do these things have not a wel ordered Conversation, but a Conversing with the generation of ungodly; &amp; when we read the plain words of Christ, <hi>Luke</hi> 17. <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven is within you,</hi> he saith, we madly wrest the reading of the words, when we neither add nor diminish; now he seems to say, It is the Kingdom of Heaven among you, and not the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven within you; and so blames the Scripture, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the doctrine of many of the <hi>Independents,</hi> who say, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is believers Rule; but he seems to charge ths Scripture with false translations, and therefore is subject to alteration, and so can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the Rule of Believers according to his own account; &amp; thus by wicked men are we blam'd when we do not speak according to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture language, and now as wickedly charged by <hi>I. S.</hi> for speaking just in the Scripture-expressions, with madly wresting the words; but thus it was before; &amp; whatsoever we do now, by enemies must be reviled, and our words abused, contrary to our innocent intents.</p>
            <p>Then in the end of his Epistle, he desires the Prayers of his Church, that his Reply may be accompanyed with power according to the truth of it.</p>
            <p>Indeed so it shall, and no more; according to the truth of it, which is very falshoods and deceits; so shall the power of the Lord confound it, and turne it into folly and confusion, as may he seen by a sober man, who this following doth with patience read, and weigh.</p>
            <p>Then many things is uttered by him in his Epistle to the Reader; he seems to shew, he saith, how <hi>R. F.</hi> and his Associates have made up <hi>A Litter and Fardel of Erroneous Divinity</hi>: and secretly charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us with making up of what we professe from some Writers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us.</p>
            <p>But to this I answer, His reproachfull words <hi>Litter,</hi> and <hi>Fardel,</hi> and <hi>Erroneous,</hi> we beare with patience, rather rejoycing that we are accounted worthy of the reproach for the truth sake from an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious man, then to be angry with our reproaches: But however, let him and all our enemies know, what we professe and bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of, we receive not from man, but from God; even the Gospel which we testify of, by the revelation of Jesus Christ in us we recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it; &amp; informs others to the same door, which is, by our Ministry, that they may receive the same: and this is but his poor shift, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalue the power and truth of Jesus, in the sight of men, who
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:61974:81"/>
would falsly make men believe, That our Doctrines are but the spawn of many ancient Errors, as he saith, brooded by some Modern Writers, when as the Doctrine of Christ &amp; the Apostles we bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to by the same spirit, &amp; not to any other Authors who were without the Spirit of Jesus: &amp; all these shifts saves not the Priests of <hi>England</hi> from being discovered, &amp; their deceits &amp; abominations to be made manifest by our Light and Doctrine, which is the Light of Christ, and the Doctrine of the holy men of God before us.</p>
            <p>And further, his wickedness appears by reproaching and reviling dead men, such as <hi>H.N. Jacob B.W.E.</hi> with others, whom I confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe were men in their Generation more honest than himself, and more upright with God, and sincere in what was made known to them, then this same reviler who is set to revile both living and dead, if they do but crosse his fancy: Let all men take notice of these things, and of his rebukes, with an evil heart, whom the Lord doth and will rebuke by the Spirit of his mouth, in the day of his just judgmens, who art a reviler of the just both living and dead: and all alonge in that Epistle, as in the rest of his Book, which is the Rebukes of a Reviler, he bends his very tongue, as the poyson of Aspes being under it, against the Quakers, reckoning them with the Papists, and such others; but this is but as the Pharises his fore-fathers did, who numbered the Son of God, and condem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And in the end, he desiers his Reader to receive in love, what in his Book <hi>is found agreeable to the Spirit of God in Scripture truth,</hi> agreed; so let it be, and therefore many things in his Book, which is not given forth by the Spirit of God, nor according to the Scripture truth, which the honest Reader may find upon a serious reading and search with the Spirit of God, &amp; according to the Scripture, is to be judged and condemned, &amp; not reeeived; what shall the honest Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er receive this for truth, That the Light of Christ Jesus is <hi>A Perverse Principle</hi>? and that Christ bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

with such like; the very transcribing of his words shewes his wicked spirit by his unsavoury words; which things we do deny in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the Lord, and are cleare in his sight from these devilish ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusations, though <hi>J.

words; for then no question but he will judge out of his preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial mind, false judgement, and pervert the innocent words into contradiction of Scripture, and of our selves; but to the single mind and Witness of God in every man we appeal for judgement, and do in the sight of God commend our selves to every mans conscience, and beg not belief of any, but know all that be in the Light of the Son of God, witness to us, and feel our Doctrine to be the Doctrine of godliness, reaching to the Witness of God in every one, whereby we are a good savour to God in all: And though <hi>J.

            <p>FOrasmuch as many of the Servants of the Lord have been moved of the Lord to set forth in order several Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of those things which the Light of the glorious Gospel shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in their hearts, hath given them the knowledge of, and for this end are they published, that others also may know the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty and truth of those things which are believed, known and enjoyed amongst us; not that they can be known by reading the Letter in which they are declared; but through their diligence and obedience to the Light wherewith Christ hath enlightened them (though not for it) which is the same Light which shined in our hearts, and gave us the Light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ; by which Light of the glorious Gospel, who are faithful in it to the Lord, their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings come to be opened, that they stumble not at those things which are testified in the Truth, neither at that which is declared in other Scriptures, but it being that in this our day it hath pleased the Father to bring forth in life and power, that mercy and truth (which the Scripture speaks of) by which ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity is purged out; and as it is become a savour of life unto life in those that receive and believe in it; so it is also become a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of death unto that death which remains in both Priests and people in this age, who hate the Light, who can scarce hear it named, or that people should be turned unto it (as the Apostle did turn them from darkness to the Light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they might receive the rem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And the Epistle which <hi>Paul</hi> wrote to the <hi>Laodiceans,</hi> which he charged the <hi>Colossians</hi> to read amongst them, (and that theirs should be read in the Church of the <hi>Laodiceans</hi>) wherein his thanks &amp; prayers to God was for their stedfastnesse in the truth, wherein he made manifest the unprofitable talkers, who went about to draw them from the truth of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and from their diligence in good works of eternall life, as many vain and unprofitable talkers are in the world now doing the same work.</p>

in writing, in counsel, and knowledge, &amp; for this end did the Apostles both preach and write, that the Faith of those which heard them, &amp; read their writings, might not stand in the wisdom of words, nor in the letter, as its ground, but in Christ the power of God, and Christ who preached the true doctrine, that in it every one might believe, said to the World, &amp; the Pharisees, While ye have the light, believe in the light, that ye may be the Children of light, and these had the letter, but did not believe in the light, which light is Christ, and which light is the foundation of Faith, and is the foundation of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny generations, in which many did believe; before this letter which declares of it was written; And that Faith which stands in the light, and in the power of God, is the ground of the Scripture letter, from whence it did proceed; after they believed they spoke and wrote that which now is declared, in Chapters. And every one which coms to the true ground of Faith, must come co the light to believe in it, that they may be the Children of it, and then the Scriptures will be profitable unto them, they with the light having the understanding opened to see for what end they were given forth, and how they come to be fulfilled, and witnessed in that which gave them forth; for the ground of Faith to believers is but one both before and since the Scripture was written, which is Christ, in whom whosoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth shall be saved, let Christ be in what he will, for he was the ground of Faith, when the letter was not; and he is the ground of Faith when it is, and no other foundation for Faith can any man lay, than that which is laid, Jesus Christ who is the true light, and enlighteneth every man that cometh into the Word, that all men in him might believe; and they that believe not that he is so, shall die in their sins, as Christ saith, <hi>John</hi> 8.24.</p>
               <p>But <hi>J.S.</hi> going on in his own devised Fables, would pervert the words of truth, both in our writings, and in the Apostles, as it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, in his writings, of this reviling Rebuke concerning, <hi>R.F.</hi> and <hi>J.N.

               <p>Now let all them of understanding, read, and compare his words, &amp; the Apostles, and they may well conclude with his confession, that he hath an old lying heart, and flesh, in which dwells no truth, but the root of errour and gainsaying of the truth; and as for many others of his devised fables, and false meanings, though I let them passe here unanswered, yet they may be seen with the mind in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in the truth; and all who are of God, and of the truth, may know that it is a small matter for us to be rebuked, or judged to be in confusion, who so evidently hath confounded both our words, and the Apostles, into his owne false meanings, and so contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts them both; but that remaineth sure which gaves forth the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and abideth in us, and we know that they cannot be broken, but must be fulfilled, as they were given forth by the Word, which they were given forth from, by taking heed unto which the young mans way is cleansed, &amp; by which the old lying heart, is reproved; that which was given forth from that Spirit, cannot be by it denyed; but that which would darken words without knowledg is denyed; that which would set up devised fables above Christ, the Spirit, and Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that by the Spirit is denyed without contradiction, and as we shall by the Spirit, and by the Scriptures trye <hi>John Stelhams</hi> Doctrin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

turned wise men backward, and made their Wisdom foolishness, and that they may see how those stumble and fall, and are sna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and taken, whose light is turned into darkness, and hovv great that darkness is; and novv is the Scripture not denied, but fulfilled; for now is the Light and Truth come into the World, by which they are found to be blind, who said they saw, and in which they see, that vvere blind: And now the depths are seen vvhich are covered vvith darkness, and <hi>Babylon</hi> is seen, the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Harlots, which bring forth in confusion, and bind up in ignorance. Other confusions and lyes I shall also mention, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven forth by <hi>J.S.</hi> in his Book.</p>
               <p>As p. 68. he saith, that God was and is the Word, according to <hi>John</hi> 1.1. and in p. 69. he saith, The Father is not the Word, nor never so called; (which is a contradiction.) And in p. 70. saith, Christ is more in the Scriptures, than in his Saints, (vvhich is false) for greater vvas that vvhich the vvords came from, than the vvords, vvhich did but declare of the fulness from vvhence they came, as all that know Christ wil bear witness unto, and against all such that say Christ is more in the words, than in them who spake the words.</p>
               <p>Again in p. 73. he saith, Christ the Author of salvation to them that obey him, speaking in the Scripture, saveth by the Scripture; which is false, and contrary to the testimony of the Scriptures, and the witness of them who witnessed his salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who said, By his Life are we saved, and by Grace through faith, which was the gift of God, and not by the Letter, and their Witness was true for God and his Works, and against all such who are of a lying heart, and spirit of error, who would make the Letter to be the Light; yea more, even that vvhich makes light to be light, and so greater; for that vvhich makes a thing, is greater than a thing that is made; and would have the Letter to be the Word, when as the Letter saith, God is the Word; and would make the Scriptures to be that by which peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are saved, as in p. 73. saying, Christ saveth by the Scriptures; but the Scriptures speak no such thing of themselves; for they say, there is no other name under Heaven by which men can be saved, but by the name of Jesus; neither is there such a word written in the Bible, that saith, men are saved by the scriptures, nor that the Light of the God-head is natural, as <hi>I. S.</hi> saith, that he may set up a light of scriptures, as he calleth it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:61974:91"/>And he speaks in p. 82. of having our minds darkned with the light of Scriptures: Mark, doth that light which he hath in all his Book been exalting above the God head-light, &amp; above that Light which Christ hath enlightned every man withal, darken mens minds? What is it then that must enlighten them? Here is his te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of the Light brought up to the ful, that all who can receiv it, may believ it, for he saith to us, if our minds were not darkned with the light of the Scriptures, the two texts in <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.18. and <hi>Col.</hi> 1.23. might resolve us how the Gospel is preached to every creature, &amp; not to the principle of Light in the Conscience; how can the Scripture resolve us of the Light, if it darken our minds? But by these things this is made manifest, that darkness hath blinded his eyes, that he neither knows the Light, nor the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures which were given forth from it.</p>
               <p>Again, Another of his contradictions concerning the Light, in pag. 23, 24. compared with pag. 75. is this, saying, the Light that shined in <hi>Pauls</hi> heart, and the Light that shineth in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is the same Light; and God who shineth in the heart by Gospel-light, according to the Apostles words, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary unto which in his 75. page, he saith, That the Gospel-light about matters of salvation, of which the Apostle speaks, never entered, never shined into mens hearts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> To this let all take notice, and consider, whether of these two Contraries they are to believe; The one saying, God shineth in their hearts by Gospel-light; and the other saith, It never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered nor shined into mens hearts: But if the Scriptures or the Apostle is to believed, he saith, <hi>For God who-commanded the Light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ; but we have this Treasure in Earthen Vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6, 7. Here was the light of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel shining in their hearts in matters of salvation, giving them the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ; and they were the Vessels in which the light did shine, and from which they spoke the hidden Wisdom of God in a mystery; and so that which they spoke of the Light, and of the Gospel, is yet a mysterie unto such whose eye is blinded with the god of this world, and the wayes of unrighteousness, knowing neither the light nor the Gospel of salvation, but filling up their iine of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:61974:91"/>
as hath been already manifest, and may further be made manifest.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>John Stelham</hi> in his sixth Head of Scripture-contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, speaks concerning the Law, and goes about to distinguish between the two Covenants which the Scriptures speak of, but knows not what he speaketh, nor of what he affirmeth, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Scriptures, speaking of a Moral and Ceremonial law, which the Scriptures speak of no such words, nor no such distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, as of a Moral law to be the Covenant of Works, and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t the Ceremonial law is not a Covenant of Works, but of Grace.</p>
               <p>And whereas he tells of a Covenant of Nature, which is one with the Covenant of Works; and so here is several Covenants which J.<hi>S.</hi> hath made, and several Names here given to the Covenants, which God never gave, nor they which spoke of the Covenants never gave such names to the law in the words of Scripture, as Moral, Legal, Natural, Ceremonial; so that is all without, and contrary to the Scripture language.</p>
               <p>And whereas he goeth about to prove <hi>Adam</hi> to be under a moral law, wdich he calls a law of Works, but hath no Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to prove it from, but from his suppositions; as thus: <hi>If it was not of Grace, it was a Covenant of works</hi>: And again, <hi>if the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of works was not made with</hi> Adam <hi>in innocency, God could not in justice require satisfaction of his posterity under the fall; &amp;c.</hi> A third supposition to prove <hi>Adam</hi> under a Covenant of Works, is this: <hi>Either he stood under a Covenant of Works, or was under the Covenant of Grace, or he was under no Covenant, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Unto which I answer; All such Priests and Teachers who be out of innocency themselves, cannot tell what Covenant those are in with God, who are innocent, and in the Image of God, in holiness and righteousness; and therefore from such have we so much perverting of the Scriptures, and violating of the law of God, to make it according to their imaginations: But unto such God saith, <hi>What hast thou to do to declare my Statutes, or that thou shouldest take my Covenant into thy mouth, seeing thou hatest instruction, and castest my words behind thee?</hi> Psal. 50.16. <hi>Thou givest thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue frameth deceit</hi>: But I say, That Covenant in which <hi>Adam</hi> was with God in his innocency, and in his image, he stood in that, and by that by which he was made a living soul, and in that was in unity and covenant with God, for the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:61974:92"/>
disobedience of which, he was driven out from God into the earth; and none were under the Law of Works, neither was that Law added, uhtil there was transgression, which it was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded because of it; but that which is innocent, and without sin, unreproveable in God's sight, is under no Law, but that which endureth for ever, which doth free from sin and death those that be in it, which is made manifest unto some since the fallihg from it, and which the Isles are to wait for, till it be made manifest, where it is not al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eady revealed; and all who come to have right to speak of God's precepts, and to take his covenant into their mouths, they see and comprehend all such darkness, which doth not speak according to words of Scripture, but speaks of three Covenants, contrary to Scripture, saying, that the first Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant promiseth nothing of salvation, nor mentioneth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of a Saviour; and yet saith, that, that Covenant is a part of God's Word, and his Will and pure Law, (and yet mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nothing of a Saviour) and again saith, that the Moral Law he calls of Works, which promiseth no salvation, mentioneth nothing of a Saviour) that this which mentioneth nothing of a Saviour, is to be a directory and rule to true believers, for the ordering of their sanctification (as it is also in Christ's hand, guiding them by his Spirit) so this cannot build nor join toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and so time to cease building any more in confusion; but in denial of that false doctrine, I say, That there is but two Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants spoken of in the Scriptures, which is a plain testimony of them, without any such confusion or contradiction, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> saying, <hi>In that he saith a new Covenant, he hath made the first old, &amp;c.</hi> And in the first Covenant, as you may read <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. In all these things there was Christ held out and menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in the shadows and figures; and so that Covenant which promiseth no salvation, nor mentioneth any thing of a Saviour, that we deny; for there is no such Covenant in the Scripture<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>; —For that which said, <hi>Do this, and live,</hi> promised life, and men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Christ who is the life; and by Christ who is the Life and Light of men, is that Covenant fulfilled; and by his Power both the obedience and life is brought forth, of which that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant speaketh; and the new Covenant being come that God hath promised, wherein he hath put his Law in their hearts, and his Spirit in their inward parts, and all such need not to come to
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:61974:92"/>
such Priests to be taught, who tel of a Covenant which promiseth no salvation, nor mentioneth any thing of a Saviour; for we who be in the second, know the first fulfilled, which Christ was held forth in, under Ordinances of Divine service, and a Worldly Sanctuary, and divers washings, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Ordinances, which never made the comers thereunto per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect as pertaining to the Conscience. But now is Christ the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of God, and Covenant of Light, come and preached, and with his Light shineth in mens Consciences, that he may make perfect as pertaining to the Conscience; which Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is now witnessed among thousands, and such denyed who speak of a Covenant that mentions nothing of a Saviour, and that to be the Rule of true believers.</p>
               <p>Again, in <hi>John Stelham's</hi> fifth head of Scripture-contradiction, he speaks concerning sin, saying, <hi>That the more a soul is sanctified. the more he sees his moats to be beams; and that</hi> Paul <hi>was groaning and sighing all his life-time under the body of sin and death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Both these are false; for the more a soul is sanctified, he is not the more taught to lye, or to see falsly; but the more he is taught to see clearly, and discern a moat to be a moat, and a beam to be a beam, and knows the difference. And <hi>Paul</hi> thanks God who had given him the victory over sin and death, which he had not while he groaned under the body of it; and so both the Saints and the Work of sanctification, is falsly accused by such, and such are to be denied as Enemies to God, and to his Work.</p>
               <p>In the reading of this, let all people take notice, that in the several and particular heads of <hi>J. S.</hi> Book, where he saith, he hath contradicted us, he is proved himself to contradict the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and so far as he contradicts the Scriptures in those parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, so far he may say he contradicts us, our testimony being one with the Scriptures in those things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pr.</hi> For in his sixth head, as concerning Justification, he saith, <hi>He that is justified, is justified by God, not under the aspect or notion of a Saint, and as such, but of a sinner, and as a sinner believing in Jesus, not as he loveth God, or overcometh the world by Faith, &amp;c. but as believing on Christ dying, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:61974:93"/>Now this testimony of <hi>J. S.</hi> is contrary to the Scripture; for God never justified any as hating of him, nor as a sinner, but as made obedient through faith, according to the Scriptures, as the Apostle witnesseth, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.16. <hi>Even by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, &amp;c.</hi> so they believed, that they might be justified; and the ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they were first called out of their ungodliness; and whom he called, them he also justified; and they whom he justified, them he also glorified; and by him all that believe are justified from all things from which they could not be justified by the Law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, Acts</hi> 13.39. And so all who are justified by the Lord, are justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied from their sins, and not in them, as all shall witness who come to be justified by Christ from their iniquity.</p>
               <p>And whereas <hi>J.S.</hi> vvould set the Law and Justice of God at a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with the Gospel, and as contrary, in saying, The Law and Justice finds and leaves us sinners, Gospel and Mercy declareth and pronounceth us righteous: Now the one pronouncing a man to be righ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eous, and the other pronouncing the same to be a sinner, these two are contrary: But the Scripture hath another testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, saying, <hi>Mercy and Truth are met together; Righteousness and Peace have kissed each other,</hi> Psal. 85.10 Now here is unity; here is not Righteousness pronounc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ng one thing, and Mercy another; for the righteousnesse of God is revealed from Heaven against the disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient; and this vvill not leave them disobedient nor sinners, if ever they come to mercy; for it doth not leave them as it finds them: And so that Doctrine is accurst from God, which saith, That Justice finds them sinners, and leaves them so; and to say that Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice pronounceth them sinners, and Mercy pronounceth them righteous: But to satisfie all people, a few vvords may serve to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer the volume of that darknesse and blindnesse given forth by him before-mentioned; should a man full of vvords be justified? <hi>Job</hi> 11.2.</p>
               <p>Again, concerning <hi>J.S.</hi> in his seventh head concerning Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he saith, <hi>That the Word of God that is preached, was never without, or besides Scripture, &amp;c.</hi> And as in other places he hath said, <hi>That the Spirit is given by the Letter,</hi> so here he vvould make Regeneration to proceed from it; which this being denied, he concludes it had been better the Scripture had not been known nor written.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:61974:93"/>
                  <hi>An.</hi> The Word and Gospel were preached unto <hi>Abraham</hi> without Scriptures, and before the Scriptures were written; and they who are regenerated and born again, it is by the immortal Word which is able to save their souls; which Word was before the Letter was written; and who be begotten again, and born by that Word, it is profitable for such that the Scriptures were written &amp; given forth, and the Scripture by such is honored; but such who call the Letter the Light and the Word, and that which begets again into the new birth, by such both the Work of God is despised, and the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures perverted and denied.</p>
               <p>Again <hi>J. S.</hi> in his 8. Head of Contradiction, speaking of perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, uttereth forth more confusion and contradiction to himself, in his speaking of the Communion of the Saints in Heaven, and doth lye concerning the Saints on earth, saying, <hi>the Saints in Heaven hoped for the perfection of their bodies at the Resurrection, &amp;c.</hi> And again contradicts that, in saying, <hi>that at death they have a final perfection, and a full harvest, and reward of peace, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Now this is the issue, that all people may take notice he hath so envied perfection and Christ's Doctrine, which saith, <hi>Be ye per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect as your Father which is in Heaven is perfect</hi>: And them who now preach that Doctrine, that he hath set out a Volume to declare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Saints being perfect here; yea, and his envy hath reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Heaven, to prove that the Saints in Heaven are not perfect, but wait for the redemption of their bodies; which now if people mind the Scripture, there is no such doctrine in it as the Saints in Heaven have not received the Redemption of their bodies; for they who had received the first fruits of the Spirit upon earth, did wait for the adoption; and for the redemption of the body, till the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it self be delivered into the glorious liberty of the sons of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. And this was witnessed, and is witnessed; and this is the Work of the Worlds Teachers, instead of presenting them perfect in Christ Jesus, as the Apostles did, they would make people believe that the Saints in Heaven their bodies are unredeemed; if so, where is that redemption wrought?</p>
               <p>And whereas <hi>I. S.</hi> vvould make people believe, that there are none clean; novv Christ said concerning those that follovved him, <hi>Now are ye clean through the Word which I have spoken unto you,</hi> John 15.3. And <hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>that the Lord is good unto such as are of a clean heart,</hi> Psal. 73.1. And the Lord said concerning his people, that he
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:61974:94"/>
would pour clean water upon them, and they should be clean from all their filthiness, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.25. and this Prophesie was to be fulfilled: And the Lord said also by his Prophet <hi>Zephaniah,</hi> That his Remnant should do no iniquity, nor speak lyes, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther should a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.1·3. And <hi>Paul</hi> preached Wisdom among them that were perfect; and as many as were perfect, should be so minded; and Christ preached to the pure in heart, that they should see God, <hi>Matt.</hi> 5. Now if there were none perfect, Christ preached unto such as there was not.</p>
               <p>Now this is the chief ground of J. <hi>S.</hi> and the rest of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies of truth and of perfection, to declare against it, because some fall from it; as his instance of <hi>C. A.</hi> or others in the like, To which I answer, Their falling into that which is not perfect, doth not make that which they fall from, imperfect; for the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels that kept not their first state, which was perfect, did fall from that which was perfect. A Virgin state is perfect; but if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny go out of that state, and become foolish, yet that which they depart from, is perfect: And if any do fall from the Truth, and do not abide in Christs Doctrine, that doth not make his Doctrine to be imperfect; for Christ saith, Except they abide in him who is perfect, they cannot bring forth fruit: Is not he that is in Christ perfect, though some do not abide in him? And is not the Truth Truth, because some deny it? Was not Christs Doctrine and the Apostles true, because <hi>Demas</hi> did forsake it, and love the present World? And was not that part of the Ministry which <hi>Judas</hi> had committed unto him, perfect? And was not he the true Christ that <hi>Judas</hi> preached, though afterwards he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed him? Now if people do but truly consider all those that now do turn from the way of Truth, which is now preached, and lived in by us, it may be an evident token to justifie us in the Way of Truth, seeing what they go into when they go from the Light which Christ hath enlightened them withall, which while they abide in it, are kept out of all filthiness of flesh and spirit, and so long they may speak of perfection, and of the gift of God which is perfect: But if any go from the Light, then they are let at liberty to act all uncleanness with greediness, and so are cast out from us, and from perfection: And if any such deny the Truth, and forsake it, yet there remains in them a
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:61974:94"/>
witness for the truth, and against their own uncleanness, as in <hi>C. A.</hi> who from the Witness of God in him was made to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, that if he had continued in the Light of Christ, he could not have so sinned against the Lord, and so by his transgression fel from the way of Life, and could not continue in Christs Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine any longer; &amp; so such things may satisfie people concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the way of Truth; for while they are of us, all such things is denyed by them; but when they go out from us, then they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Drunkards, Swearers, Prophane, Adulterers, Fornicators, and so every evil Work is committed, and then they turn to the Priests Doctrine, there all such things are, and are excused; and then the Priests rejoice and give thanks if any turn from the Light of Christ, and the obedience of the Gospel, into drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenness and prophaneness again, where they were before; and if they wil but swear and respect mens persons, and use the rod of violence, and pers<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>cute and shed the blood of the innocent, and be conformable to the World, that is the Priests rejoicing; and if any turn from the truth into any act of uncleanness, then they take that as a proof against those that abide in the truth; and such a thing is a better proof to them then all the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and those are they that rejoice in iniquity, and watch for evil, and so they rejoice in that which we have cast out as abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; and these are they that plead for a life in sin while they are here, and that say that the saints glorified in Heaven do yet hope for the resurrection of their bodies, and so not come to the end of their hope though in Heaven; when as the Saints up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth witnessed the end of their hope, the salvation of their souls. Now these may wel deny perfection on earth, who deny it in heaven, which the Saints, we, and the Scriptures do witness it in both, and against all such who are not fit to speak of the things of God.</p>
               <p>Again, in his ninth Head of contradiction, he speaks of a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare (which yet himself never came unto) and in it he wrests <hi>Pauls</hi> words, and so would turn the truth into a lye, saying as if <hi>Paul</hi> should say thus: If sin that wars and sights in me, hath no power to condemn me, then there is no condemnation to me: Which words <hi>Paul</hi> never spake, and it is a lye in the ground; for it is not sin that is the condemnation, but the Light which lets

               <p>Again in his tenth Head of contradictions speaking of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as if he would prove that we denyed or disclaimed god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sorrow; and his proof is this; <hi>If we disclaim in-dwelling sin in the godly, we disclaim godly sorrow.</hi> Let all people take notice of this, If we deny in-dwelling sin, we deny godly sorrow; this is contradiction in the highest degree; but against it, this I shall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that none comes unto godly sorrow, but they deny in dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling sin; and they that do not deny in-dwelling sin, denies god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sorrow.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>John Stelham</hi> in his eleventh Head of contradictions to the Scripture, in his speaking of the Word and means of Grace, he is setting up that which before he hath been pulling down, in p. 123. where he saith, <hi>That they are justified from all Legal obligations and conditions of their own workings both within them &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them.</hi> And in page 174. he is setting up obligations and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of Reading, Hearing, Prayer, Preaching, to which he saith Life and Salvation is promised; and so would have salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion come by Works, which he hath so much declared against before, and so makes prayer, reading, preaching, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the means through which salvation comes, but the cause for which they are saved, saying, <hi>To Prayer is promised salvation.</hi> Now to the informing of the minds of people, I say, That all promises are to the Seed, and the fulfilling of the promises is witnessed through its obedience to Christs command, and through the Works of righteousness; but none can pray so as to be heard of God, and accepted, but who have first known, heard and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him whom they call upon, which none do but who own th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And in the general I answer, Much by us hath been written and spoken to this purpose; so our judgements in this charge is fully known, of which we are not ashamed before men, as being fully justified herein in the sight of the Lord.

And this is a full answer in general as to the thing, though I pursue him not in every particular word and argument, to lay open his folly; but our judgement in this is known; he that can receive it, let him; and the belief of the wicked we shall not beg: In these things we are approved of God, and in the denial of all false imitations; and who is he that shall condemn?</p>

S. judge by consequence what he will.</p>
               <p>And further he would plead for the Title of Master, from the Example of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Servant; but this is nothing to prove the lawfulnesse of a Minister of Christ, that they may be called Master: for Christ saith to his Ministers, <hi>Be ye not called Masters</hi>; and the Spirit of Christ being our rule, that leads us in the fulfilling of Christs words, let J. S. shuffle as he will: Also he lyes of J.N. to say, he denyes and grants the same thing to be in the letter: for though he say, He that believes hath the witnesse in himself, which is truth; yet he doth not say, The Letter is the Belivers witnesse, which he seems falsly to be charged withall; and he saith, the Spirit of God must give the spiritual understanding of the Scriptures; But this he doth in another way, than that whereby he inspired the Pen-men of the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>Now this is false Doctrine: For Christ the way, the same to us, as to them, and not another way of understanding Scriptures, nor by another Spirit than that which gave them forth; and he saith, Christ directed to himself, <hi>John</hi> 5.39. as revealed in the Scriptures, and more than that, as conveyed by the Scriptures to a Soul: Now let the Reader take notice and search that Scripture, Whether he hath not added to it, yea or nay? or where any ever had any Christ conveyed to them by Scriptures: It doth say, the Scriptures testifie of him; but it doth not say, that he is revealed in the Scriptures, nor conveyed by them to a Soul; and this is his additional gloss to corrupt the Text, to undervalue the eternal Spirit of the Father, by which Christ is only revealed, and received, and not by the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>And for <hi>E. B.</hi> to say, That he came not to them with enticing words, neither what he had gathered from the Scripture without him, but to declare the Word of the Lord, and not to speak his own conceivings and imaginations, this is true, and no contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction

B.</hi> compiled a Book out of Scripture <hi>Collections,</hi> is false; for having the same Spirit which gave forth the Scripture, which brings the Scripture to remembrance, is not compiling a Book out of Scriptures: and <hi>J.

               <p>But he that speaks the imagination of his own heart from the Saints conditions, he is heard and owned; and this is neither Scripture contradiction, nor self contradiction, let <hi>J.

S. and all his fellows; and so he must revoke, who saith, <hi>the Spirit is in the letter,</hi> and the spirit gives life, but the letter kills: In his proof he saith, <hi>The written Word, viz.</hi> the Letter <hi>is of greater authority then the writer</hi>: Mark here, Christ was one of them which gave forth Scripture,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:61974:104"/>
and he was a greater authority than what was written: and I say, as it is plain to all honest men who can believe truth, that the holy men of God, who had the spirit, were of greater authority than the Scriptures since have been which they left behinde them. But J. S. hath set Christ, and all them that gave forth scripture to be lesse in authority than the scriptures: Let wise men judg of this matter; he saith, <hi>They were imperfectly holy that wrote forth the Scriptures,</hi> and this is an absolute lye; for the scr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:61974:107"/>
be quiet of him, their wills being stifled by drinking his blood as it were: but that wicked men must add to their own wickedness till it be fulfilled, that they may receive their reward; and <hi>I. P.</hi> was bold, as is the children of God; and though <hi>J. S.</hi> would clear him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self and his company from what was done to <hi>I. P.</hi> yet by the effect it appeared that there was enough envy in them towards him and the truth; and though his body be in the ground, yet the Spirit of the Lord which guided him stands alive, a sufficient witness against them, and all their cruell and wicked dealing; and let <hi>J. S.</hi> judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be what it will, neither concerning growth of Grace, nor forms of Religion, nor fruits of the Spirit do we at all contradict the Spirit of God: neither doth he prove us in these things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he accuseth us in strife and debate, (except against such as <hi>J.S.</hi> and the Devils Kingdom,) neither in emulation, hatred, scoffs, or any of these things which the Lord hath redeemed us from, though we be falsly accused in these things, as in many other by him; and whereas he would prove their preaching in their method, &amp; Points, and Reasons, and Uses from the example of the Saints in former ages, he falls far short in effecting his extent, for he cannot prove that they studied for what they spake, nor that in such a way they delivered what they said an hour by a glass, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as the Priests of this age do; also if it were they preached in the like manner as the Apostles did, yet not by the same spirit, but by the spirit of error, and for a wrong end; that is the thing which makes their manner abominable, when as they are not guided with the same Spirit of the Apostles, and their preaching in their method of points, and particulars is rather an art of preaching by humane policy, and not the gift of preaching by the Spirit of God; neither do we concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing humility and love contradict our selves, but are in humility &amp; love towards all men; even such as wrongs us we seek no revenge against, and herein doth our humility and love appear, yet cannot we respect any mans person with hat or knee, and that is it which <hi>J.

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:61974:107"/>
own praying in the Spirit of God, bur do deny it without the Spirit, and this is no contradiction; he may as well say it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction in Christ to cry against the prayers of the Pharisees, and yet to teach his Disciples to pray, and to pray himself; this is the same cause of ours which he foolishly charges with contradiction, and as I have said the prayers of the Wicked we deny, and yet doth own prayer in the Spirit, and who are moved by the Spirit morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or evening, or at meals, or otherwise, and this is truth, let <hi>J.S.</hi> gather what he can from it.</p>
               <p>Further, he saith, <hi>If we teach one another, why do we condemn them for teaching</hi>? But to this I have answered; Preaching or Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the Spirit we own, and without the Spirit we deny; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we say we own all that which is Gods, as Baptisme, the Lords Supper, and Sabbath, &amp;c. yet doth disown in practice their Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Baptisme, and their form of breaking of Bread and Wine, and their forms of Church fellowship, and their form of keeping a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath; this he charges to be contradiction, but it is not so in the sight of the Lord, though <hi>I.S.</hi> falsely so judge it; for their Baptism and breaking of Bread and Wine, and their Church-fellowship, and keeping of a day, I say their exercise in these things we do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to be of God, as in measure is proved, and may be further if need require; and I say we own that which is Gods, and which is led unto by his Spirit, and practised in his fear, and counsel, &amp; yet we do deny all their Imaginations of any thing which God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, doth own the command of God, and yet doth not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict our selves, though <hi>I. S.</hi> falsely so judge of us.</p>
               <p>Further, he charges us with self-contradiction concerning speech, and silence, because we check some for speaking, and yet speaks or writes our selves; but this is the same with the former, and the same answer will serve, that speaking that which is not in the Spirit we check, which is not the voice of Christ but of the stranger, and yet doth own that which is spoken by the Spirit of God, and herein doth not contradict our selves.</p>
               <p>Further, he saith, We contradict our selves concerning Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science and Laws, because we say there must be no Law concerning Religion, viz, to bind any man to worship in this or the other way, and to bind him from this or that way of Worship, and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:61974:108"/>
yet in exhorting the Rulers, that their Laws be according to that in the Conscience; but in these words there is no contradiction; for the Laws being according to the light in every mans Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that Law will not binde or limit the conscience from this or that way of worship in Religion; for that Law is unjust, which binds or limits the pure conscience of any man: but that Law which is contrary to the light in every mans conscience, is oppression, and we bear witnesse against it: and though we do say no Law must be laid upon Religion, that is to say, to binde any mans Conscience to or from such a form of Religion: and though we further say, that all just Law is, and should be according to every mans Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science; yet in this there is no contradiction.</p>
               <p>And whereas <hi>J.S.</hi> speaks of such Laws, who persecuted, prisoned, and crucified for the testimony of a good Conscience, <hi>God hath hewen down in all ages,</hi> saith he: Let the Rulers of <hi>England</hi> take notice of this from the mouth of one of their Teachers. And further I adde, so will God hew down in this Age all those Lawes by which many are persecuted and prisoned, as he hath done in other Ages: therefore let it be considered by them.</p>
               <p>And he saith, <hi>The Magistrate is not to level his Law with every mans conscience and light</hi>: and this he speaks in opposition to us, but he needs not; for we say the same, that some mens Consciences are defiled, and we do not desire the Laws to be made according to mens several Opinions, and defiled Consciences, but according to the light of Christ Jesus in every mans Conscience, which is but one in all, and is according to the Law of God, and every just Law will be according to it; and though J.S. by his own meaning would make it appear Contradiction in our saying no Law must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Religion, and yet saying, all Laws should be according to the light of Christ in the Conscience: Now by these words we do not mean that we would have a Law according to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but no Law to limit to or from this or that manner of Religion: And this doth very well agree with our saying, Let all your Laws be according to the Light of Christ: so by his misinterpretation of the first, he makes it appear to be contradiction to the second; but it is not in the light of the Spirit of God.</p>
               <p>And further, <hi>R. F.</hi> saying, the Law of God answers his Justice, and the Light of Christ in the conscience answers
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:61974:108"/>
the Law of God, which is perfect according to that in the Conscience: these words J. S. charges with two Errors: but let the Reader try where the Error lies, and not believe J. S false deduction from <hi>R.F.</hi> plain words, which are simply uttered, though subtily wrested.</p>
               <p>And J. S. speaks as if some would have Magistrates to make Laws to binde themselves from striking at Offenders, Blasphemers, Gospel, and Church disturbers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In answer to this, We are not they that would have any Magistrates to bind themselves from striking at offenders, who are truly able to judge of Offences: we own that such should be punished according to the offence; but the Magistrates Law reache<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And as for Blasphemy, and Gospel and Church disturbing, we find many Magistrates not able to judge thereof; but many on the other side calling <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

S. speaks of, where the strong man armed keeps the house, and these are rather a terror to well-doers then to evil; and such Magistrates, and such Laws by which the just are oppressed, and the hands of the wicked strengthened will the Lord confound in a day, to the glory of his name, and to the refreshing of all his People who are now every way oppressed by evil men, both by Teachers and People.</p>
               <p>And as for the rest of his Book, its but of the same nature with the former, and not worth answering to; onely his lyes I do deny; and his first following is, that all our doctrines are raised upon the ruines of the Scriptures excellency and authority: this is false, neither doth his proof at all make it good. His second lye is, that our corrupt Tenents are built upon false and novel Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations, and this is two lyes together; our Tenents are not corrupt, neither do we build any thing which we hold upon false Interpretation<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

His fourth lye is, that unbelief begets and procreates all our er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and our love of error with our derisions of the truth; here is many lyes folded up in one, which are all denied with the life of God, and the author of them proved to be of the Devil, and we proved to be of God, who are spoken all manner of evil against falsly for the name of Jesus.

Alas, alas man, how art thou fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into the pit which thou hast digged for another! and how doth the shame overtake thee, which thou hast thought should have fallen upon us! Let thy wickedness correct thee, and know thou, that the Lord will not forsake his people, who cannot be offended in Christ, though thou cast stumbling blocks of iniquity in the way, and would cause them to sin; but even so much the more as thou speakest evil against the way of the Lord, are they the more upright therein, and the more loving and delighting in the path of righteousness, and thou hast but the more fully discovered in many things from thy own pen, the wickedness and wrath that hath secretly lodged in thy heart: and it appears that thy wisdom is devilish, and from below, decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and being deceived, and thy path is in craft and subtilty, and not in innocencie and plain simplicity: and in this manner, and by this means chiefly is thy work managed unto an evil end,

And this is the Testimony which we have born, and shall bear to the end; and who believes it, and who believes it not, this is the hand of the Lord according to his pleasure, and to him we leave it, and so we do and must clear our consciences from time to time, while the Lord gives us a being.

I am sure he might have made better use of his time in another exercise, than to have writ against the servants of the Lord: It had been more honest for him to have set his pen to paper, and studyed to have given his testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony against the Prid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I say, it had been more honest, and liker a Saint, to have sought the reforming of prophaneness and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness that greatly abounds in this City, than to have studyed two years to bring forth his invented stuff against a harmless and innocent people, which he, nor any can justly charge with evil, but as he hath digged deep by his imaginations, in recollecting a seeming-contradiction out of our writings, which is no contradiction, no more then Christs words are, who saith, <hi>Except ye eat my flesh, and drink my blood, ye have no life in you:</hi> And yet in the same discourse saith, <hi>The flesh profits nothing:</hi> And for <hi>Isaiah</hi> to go with the Word of the Lord to <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> to tell him he should dye and not live; yet in the same instant of time, told him he should live and not dye: Would not <hi>John Jackson</hi> have counted these contradictions? But what he hath done in this, in sending forth a Book against the <hi>Quakers,</hi> he hath been so far from beating down sin, drunkards, and rude scorners, and abusive

So his work is counted of us, and cast by as our spoiled prey of <hi>Babylons</hi> treasure; onely this is sent abroad after it in the pursuit of it, which is not done with multitudes of words of mans wisdom, but in the plain nakedness of innocent truth, which is more strength than all his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of guile whereby he would deceive the people; but he can deceive none but such as are deceived already; for all that are in the Light, and in the Truth, sees beyond all that he can say, and are established where his words can never reach them, to take away their peace, or disquiet them; for as I said, we are established upon a sure foundation, and are tryed and proved, and cannot be blown away with any windy Doctrines of men, which begets into strife, and not into true sincerity of heart, but wo unto that man that works offence, and doth cast stumbling-blocks in the way of the simple.

And as concerning this thing which was looked upon as a breach among us by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, yet it's over, and Truth stands a top of it, and the beauty of Truth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears through it all, and Truth is more lovely when it is proved and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: What if the Lord suffer his to be led and tempted for a season, let not the wicked boast of this; for though the righteous fall, he shall rise again; but the wicked fall into mischief. But yet we learn something by this, what a great use the Devil hath made hereof, and how many Books and lying Scribblers hath been sent forth about it concerning us, which are all counted by us no better than the most corrupted Treasure that ever grew in <hi>Babylon;</hi> and the best of it is but baubles to please vain minds; for
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:61974:113"/>
men of sound understandings can take no pleasure therein. And we see how by all means the Devil and his people seeks occasion against the ways and people of Gods and how glad are the wicked when they get an occasion against the Lords people! And how do they glory in it, and boast in it for a time, thinking that their hands are strengthened in a greater boldness to do mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief! And <hi>John Jackson</hi> is one of those that takes pleasure in these things, and he hath managed his business with a great deal of craft, but there are none that will praise him for it, except such whose wicked hands he strengthens, and such as he must have stumblings, after the way of the Lord hath been so fully manifested, and they receive it not, and they must fall and be broken. And seeing that the wicked doth take occasion, and seeks occasion against the innocent, this will make many more watchful and more circumspect, and more to walk in God's wisdom, and to deny their own wayes, lest offences come by them: And let him put off his Armor, and lay down his Weapons, and I wish he may spend the next two years to come better than he hath done these last, aod that the little fire in the Embers may kindle to the burning of his corruption, rather than into a blind zeal against the innocent people. And what in this Book is written, is not to contend or strive for mastery, but to clear the Truth, and to remove all cause of stumblings from before the face of all the upright in heart.</p>

               <p>Now the testimony which this Author gives to that which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a long travel is come forth, is this, That it hath been in his breast two years and upwards, while it at length is come forth as an untimely birth, or as that which is born out of due time, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring under the burden of being both unnecessary and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonable.</p>
               <p>Such a Testimony as this, seems to beget a Wonder in the airy Spirits of men, as if a Monster were to be seen, (What, two yeares travel, and yet an untimely birth!) And many such false cryes are in this City, which enters into the sensual part of men, and gets into the affections; but there is a Seed risen which hath received from the Father the spirit of

judgement and understanding, and it doth not own things accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the report, nor judge of things according to their names in outward appearance, but hath a measuring line given unto it, and a true ballance whereby voices, ways, worships, and testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies is tried before they be approved; and therewith shall this spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit be tried, and voice which is come forth crying <hi>Hosanna to the Son of David,</hi> or a testimony to the Lords Christ; which being truly weighed and searched, may prove a testimony against the Lords Christ, which hath enlightned every man that cometh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, in setting up mans spirit to be the light instead of the Lords Christ. But first let us consider the burden under which this man hath laboured; which is, as he saith, that which is both unnecessary and unseasonable. First unnecessary, because the same hath been before by better hands; so it is not to be admired as a Monster, because it hath already been, and effected nothing. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, unseasonable, because those are already resolved, that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ is the true light which hath enlightned every man that cometh into the world, which he would resolve, that the spirit in every man is that light; and so according to this, every man must follow his own spirit instead of following the light which Christ hath enlightned him withal. Now this burden thus considered, which is both unnecessary and unseasonable, having been in his brest above two years, all that have received the spirit of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and knows the workings of the mysterie of iniquity, and can truly read the state of those which are filled with unrighteousness, knows that this birth is cursed before ever it came forth, and it had been better that it had never been born nor brought forth into the world; for it will be to the great aggravation of his sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and misery which did conceive it, and so long travel in it, and at last brought it forth; but among the untimely births shall we reckon it, which never saw the Sun, nor never received blessing from the Father; and happy shall he be that rewardeth thee as thou hast rewarded us, and happy shall he be that takes and dasheth thy untimely birth against the stones, <hi>Psal.</hi> 137.8, 9.

as this: And so from experience he may say, that it is both unnecessary and unseasonable either to conceive, or bring forth any such thing against the seed which the Lord hath blessed; for there was never any as yet which did strive against the Lord or his anointed ones which did prosper, neither shall to the ends of the earth.</p>
               <p>So the burden of this man is searched and judged, and f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But if the fire of the Lord had been kindled in him, it would have consumed this birth in the womb, before ever it had been brought forth.</p>
               <p>But the hour is coming and now is, in which the Lord is fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his promise according to the Scriptures, which saith, that he will make <hi>Jerusalem</hi> a burthensome stone for all people; all that burthen themselves with it shall be cut in piece<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="163" facs="tcp:61974:115"/>
the burthen of the Lord, the fire of the Lord within them. But saith the Lord to such, I will destroy that man and his house, and the burthen of the Lord shall ye mention no more, for every mans word shall be his burthen: for ye have perverted the words of the living God, of the Lord of hosts our God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.36. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is the measuring-line gone forth to measure the false burthens whereby they pervert the words of the living God, with their own words and imaginations; and unto those which ever were reproachers of the way and people of God, the Lord saith, I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you, and a perpetual shame which shall not be forgotten, <hi>Ier.</hi> 13.40. So this is written that no man should any more burthen themselves with the burthensom stone, whereby they will be broken to pieces if they fall upon it: But that every one may come to it, that with it they may see their false burthens, and the sin which doth so easily beset them, and may cease grieving of the spirit of the Lord while his spirit striveth with them; and may come to know every man his own word, which will become his burthen when it returns again unto him. But the word of the Lord goeth forth and returns not empty, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth it burthen him which it goes forth from, when it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns again unto him. Although the true burthen of the word of the Lord be known in many before it go forth from them.</p>
               <p>Therefore then seeing that it is an untimely birth, and not that which is born of the spirit, which is come forth from him to whom I now am to speak.

                  <hi>That it doth not lead into all truth such as love it and obey it,</hi> p. 54.</p>

Hath God sent his Son a light into the world to drive the souls from God, and keep them in the fall: Now let all consider and judge that ever knew the light, whether it be darkness, or it be light which drives the soul from God, and keeps it in the fall.

If so, then it is not the work of the light which lightneth every man that cometh into the world; is not this to call light darkness, to say that the light is so far from leading up to God, that it drives the soul from God, and keeps him in the Fall: What is that which leads man out of the fall, if the light keep man in it? As this is contrary to Scripture, and to truth, so it is contrary to his own words, as in <hi>pag.</hi> 7. there saying, <hi>That by the Light is the will and mind of the Creator made known unto man, and he sufficiently qualified to see it, and understand it.</hi>

               <p>Another false Testimony concerning the light is this, <hi>That at first it moved upward, and man could look God in the face, and serve him; but now since the fall the Thief is got into the Candle, and now the Spirit burns downward, and discovers the things beneath.</hi>

And that light which is the condemnation of the world, who love the darknes rather then Christ, the same is the Saviour of all them that believe; and one man loves it, &amp; another hates it; yet it is the same light, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.19. but the Scripture bears no such testimony as that there is two lights in man, the one spiritual, the other natural; and for any man to say that the light of Christ is natural, is blasphemy against the Son of God, and is a sin not easily forgiven; and it is hard for such to find the place of repentance; for every one that comes to repentance, must first come to the light which Christ hath enlightned them withall, and must know it to be spiritual, and confess it so, and with this light come to discern the two births, the one from the other, and their several natures; and how that the one birth is guided by the light, it being as the eye, giving them to see what to speak, before they speak and so keeps them out of the worlds line, which is confusion; and as a Te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Another testimony concerning the light, relating to the two Covenants is this, <hi>That as there was a new Covenant diverse from the former, the old, so there must of necessity be another light to accompany it, diverse from the former, that is, as then mans spirit, so now the spirit of the Lord, &amp;c. page</hi> 35.</p>

Now all people is to know that there was a ministration different from the administration of the Gospel, the new Covenant a different administration from the old; but there is no necessity that it be ministred from another spirit, nor from another Lord, nor from another Light; therefore to say, that because the Covenants or Administrations are diverse one from another, that therefore it must not be the same spirit, but the one by the spirit of man, the other the spirit of God, and that the lights is to be diverse the one from the other, this is a false Testimony; for the same spirit in which the Law was admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred (the first Covenant) in the same was the second admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred, which doth make perfect according to the conscience.

As <hi>Stephen,</hi> a man full of the holy Ghost, did bear witness, saying unto <hi>Saul</hi> and the rest, <hi>Ye stiff necked and uncircumcised in hearts and ears, ye do always resist the holy Ghost, as your fathers did, so do ye; which of the Prophets have not your fathers persecuted, and they have slain them which shewed before of the coming of the just One, of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murtherers, who have received the Law by the disposition of Angels, and have not kept it.</hi> When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart. So here is little ground in those for any to say they follow the light within them, and to say that they was not enlightned, which had received the Law, which is light, by the disposition of Angels, and d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Here they disobeyed that which they had received, which was the light, and did always resist the holy Ghost which was able to have led them from their disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and stiffneckedness; and if they did persecute to death for lack of knowledge, and so did it ignorantly, it was because they rejected knowledge, and forgot the law of their God which they had received, as the Priests did in <hi>Hos.</hi> 4.6. and because they did forget the Lord, as those did in <hi>Jer.</hi> 18. so it was not because they were never convinced nor reproved, but because they would have none of his reproofs, for they would not walk in his ways, neither were obedient to his law.

when he was fallen from Gods image into transgression; that which made manifest his transgression was the light which he was fallen from, &amp; God did never write his law in mans heart but there was a measure of Christ: But men in ignorance and blindness pretend to be Ministers of distinctions between their Law &amp; Christ, when as they neither know what they say, nor wherof they affirm, not seeing how it was added because of transgression, till the seed should come, ordained by Angels in the hands of a Mediator; <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.19. &amp; as well ministred forth in the light of the Mediator: For though there was, and is diversity of administrations, and of ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, yet the same Lord, and the same Light, that Light in which the Prophets saw Christ, and prophesied before-hand of the coming of the Just, was the same in which the Apostles witnessed him come; and the same light which lets men see their sins, is that which lets them see their Saviour, and leads them from their sins to Christ, as they are obedient to it. But to say there is the disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of sin and iniquity where the sound of Christ as a door, the light, the way hath not been, this remains to be proved, seeing the Apostle saith, That <hi>the sound is gone into all the earth, and the words to the end of the world</hi>: Have they not at all heard? Yes verily: That which makes manifest is light; Is there light making sin ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, and is there nothing of Christ, seeing that his life is the light of men, and that men have no light but what proceeds from his life; When was ever Christ and the light which discovers sin, separated? and where is that Scripture which saith that the sound of Christ, as a light, hath never been heard, where sin and iniquity is discovered, but that which hath brought forth these things may well be called an untimely birth, which ntver saw the Sun, not never knew the light which Christ hath enlightned every man withall which cometh into the world? for a little of this fruit doth manifest that tree from whence it springs, &amp; so we shall judge the tree by it's fruits: Another fruit from this tree is to give his testimony of the Law of Faith, which is this.</p>

Here it doth appear Faith is a mysterie to thee, and thy eye hath not seen it, nor the ear heard, neither hath it entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy heart to conceive Faith in the working and operation of it. And in that thou sayest well, that it was not given thee to understand how it is written upon every man's heart; and thou had done well if thou had not stretched thy self beyond the line of thy knowledge and understanding; for thou thy self confessest, that unto those first believers, <hi>Abel, Enoch, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, David, Daniel,</hi> and the rest, there was communicated unto them a Spirit of Faith, and a Light sutable and proportionable, whereby they were enabled to behold Christ, who was the object of their Faith: Then if it did arise from the Spirit of Faith within them, &amp; the Light of Christ, who was the Author of their Faith, it did not arise from the Declaration of God in the promise without; so that the mysterie of Faith vvhich is held in a pure conscience, is yet to be learned, vvhich vvas vvitnessed amongst the Saints: So vvhen thou vvrites again of the Lavv of Works, or the Lavv of Faith, or the discovery vvhich the Lord maketh to his creature under the diversity of these administrations, keep back to the measure of the gift of God, and then vvil thy testimony be no larger then thy knowledge, vvhich is a guilt hath spread o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver many in these days; but this I say, Blessed is the man which doth not condemn himself in the thing vvhich he allovveth, and vvhich doth not destroy himself vvith the breath of his ovvn mouth; but there is a generation which their own breath as fire shall devour them.</p>

Testimony which the children of Light give of it, is also de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised and contended against, as if it were not to be owned for a Doctrine of Truth, vvhich Doctrine of Truth hath been laid often before people, and is yet once more, that they may consider, prove and try, and so believe, and so be able to give a testimony from the Witness of God in themselves.</p>
               <p>First, We say that Christ is the Light of the World, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his ovvn vvords, <hi>John</hi> 8.12. And again we say, That he hath enlightened every man that cometh into the World, according to his vvords vvho vvas sent a Messenger before his face to bear vvitness to the truth, and his vvitness is true, <hi>John</hi> 2.9. And as Christ hath enlightned every man that cometh into the World, so we say to every man, vvarning both small and great to believe in the Light, that they may be the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Light, vvhich vvas Christ's Doctrine to the World, <hi>John</hi> 12.36: And now what Christ doth and effecteth by it in those that believe in his Light, and followeth it, which effects and operations by the World is denyed, and by us is affirmed; some of the effects of it I shall mention, which is opposed; as first, That it wil not let those that are guided by it, take Gods Name in vain, but vvil draw them out of the Worships of the World, and keep them in the fear of God, and to stand stil in it, is the first step to peace. That it discovers things that are contrary to it. That it is their Teacher that love it, and their condemnation that hate it, according to Christs words, <hi>John</hi> 3.19. That waiting in it, wil guide them to God, and shew them the way to the Father, as Christ saith, <hi>No man cometh unto the Father, but by me,</hi> John 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6. And no man cometh unto the Father by Christ, but as they are led and guided by his Light within them. That it opens all the Scriptures, and leads man out of the fall, up to God; for him hath the Father given to be a Leader and Commander unto the people, and he lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them by his Light. Another effect is, That it convinceth of all ungodliness and worldly lusts, and is a Teacher and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector, teaching and directing in righteousness, purity and holiness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that the Light is but one in him that loves it, and in him that hates it, leading the one to God from whence it comes, to receive eternal life, and condemning the other from God, because he obeyeth not the truth, that
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:61974:124"/>
he might be saved. And this is the Testimony of Truth which is now held forth, never to be denyed. But who hath believed our report? even they to whom the Arm of the Lord is revealed: And this is the way by which people may come to know the truth of this Testimony, by obeying the Light which Christ hath enlightened them withal, thereby shall they know whether this Doctrine be of God, or whether we speak of our selves, and whether all those effects are not brought forth by the working of Christ's Light in them; and then they shall not believe one<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And this was his witness, and his Messengers witness, <hi>that he was the Light of the world</hi>; and, <hi>that this is the true Light which hath enlightened every man that cometh into the world, John</hi> 8.12. <hi>John</hi> 1.9. And this contrary testimony which is brought forth, is this, <hi>That it is the spirit of man that is the Light which hath enlightened every man</hi>; and so going about to prove the spirit of man not to be sufficient, under this would destroy the sufficiency of the Light of Christ. But the Scriptures never did give testimony that the spirit of man was the Light of the World; neither did we ever say, that this Light was the spirit of every man, nor a natural Light; and therefore this man who hath writ a volume in proving a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Light, or man's reason insufficient, let all people take notice what he contradicts or disproves by it; he doth not by it contradict nor disprove any thing that we have said; for we never did affirm that man's reason was the Light, but he hath laboured to contradict himself: He hath set up an Image, and then glories in breaking of it down, and from our words draws a false inference, and glories in confounding it; &amp; this is the general course of our opposers, to raise a false pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position or conclusion from their own imaginations, &amp; then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict

Therefore in vain is the Net spread in the sight of any bird, and in vain do they exercise their strength against the Lord's Annointed; for this which they have brought forth, is but as setting of bryars and thorns in battel against the Lord; or as if the untimely birth should strive against that birth which is brought forth without deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to slay it, as those in former ages, who were wiser in their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration then the children of Light, sought to slay the Heir, that the Inheritance might be theirs. In like manner do men now also rise up against the life of the same Seed which is risen in the hearts of the children of men, to slay it; that so they may profess the Scriptures in their high swelling words of vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, having mens persons in admiration because of advantage; for if this Seed doth live, which the Lord hath not only brought to the birth, but also brought forth, it will stop that profession which stands in the hypocrisie, and will quench that violence of fire in which that zeal flames out, which is not according to knowledge: But the Seed is risen which inherits the strength of the Almighty, which can bear all things, and suffer all things, and will come to reign over all gain-sayers; for all the high swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling words of vanity shall come to nought, and truth shall be exalted over all, in the power of the eternal Spirit, when black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of darkness wil cover all those spirits which have spent their strength against the appearance and manifestation of Truth; and those that now boast themselves in their presumption against the servants of the Lord, and testimony of truth, shall come to be a servant of servants, even to the least in the Kingdom of God, before they have right unto that which they now profess, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

               <p>
                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:61974:126"/>Another Accusation is against these two Writers, <hi>Richard Farns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth,</hi> &amp; <hi>Francis Howgil,</hi> as if they <hi>should be in an unreconciled differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; because the one hath affirmed, That the Light of Christ is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to open all the Scriptures: And the other saith, Thou that tells of opening Chapters or Verses by meanings, thou never heard a word of Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> These are no differences; for the Light of Christ and mans meanings are contrary: So for the one to say the Light doth open; and the other to say mans meanings doth not open, this is not contrary; So the confusion is turned again to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuser, and doth not belong to these two Writers. So the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of this Accuser is to be taken notice of, which would make people believe things that are not; for if he write his Book for those that can neither read, see, nor hear, his labour is in vain; and if he write it to those that can read, see, hear and understand, they will account it foolishness, especially in this day when the Light of life is broken forth among the children of men, to give them an understanding according to truth, for in this day he that keepeth silence is reputed wise; and better is he that keepeth silence, then he that speaks, unless the spirit of the Lord give him utterance.</p>
               <p>Another Accusation is against <hi>W.D.</hi> he speaking to such a one as is guided by the Lamb, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> saying, <hi>The Light in thy Conscience, the righteous Law, cryes through thy earthly heart, and brings it into judgement, &amp;c. And then speaking of the parable of the little leaven hid in three measures of meal, that it changeth the whole lump into the nature of it self: So the little light that shines in thy dark heart, is the powerful Word of Faith, and that the Light is the sure Word of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, whereunto ye do well to take heed, until the day dawn, and the day-star arise in your hearts. And for these things he is accused.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Those that are guided by the Lamb, do witness that the Light, the righteous Law, cryes through the earthly heart, and brings it into judgement, and will not accuse one for say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so. And as for speaking of the little light, as Christ spoke of the little Leaven, was it no offence in the dayes of the son of man to preach that the Kingdom of Heaven was like unto a grain of Mustard-seed, or like unto a little leaven? And is it an offence
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:61974:126"/>
now to preach the word of Faith to be as a little light, or to preach the annointing to be as a little light, in those in whom the light is little, doth this also offend you? What then if we should say, That Christ is the light of life, the son of righteousness, &amp; the glory and express figure of the Fathers substance in some, and but as a little light, or day-star in others, or in others as a light before the day-star arise in their hearts? Is not the light great in some, &amp; little in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? And is not Christ the same? May that only be called Christ which takes away the sins? And may not that also be called Christ which pierceth through the soul, &amp; revealeth the thoughts of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hearts? <hi>Luke</hi> 2.35. May he only be called Christ unto whom the Father hath given the Heathen for his inheritance, and the utmost parts of the earth, for his possession? who reigneth, and hath, all his enemies under his feets, &amp; is not he the same as he is descended into the lower parts of the earth, &amp; which took upon him the form of a servant? So therefore that none may err in their judgments con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the testimony which is given of Christ, &amp; of his light, his light is more or less according to his manifestation in every one, there being given to every one a manifestation of the spirit to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit withal, &amp; every one is to be turned to the measure of their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation, to know &amp; witness Christ in it; though in many it be but as a little light, yet they are to be turned unto it, while it is so, which as it doth encrease, &amp; is enlarged, it may be called, or decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red under another name than little, as the Kingdom of Heaven is not alwayes like unto a grain of mustard-seed, nor as a little leaven but comes to rule in the children of men: And whereas the Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser replieth against the light, and against Christ to be the word of Faith; saying, Christ is called the Word of God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.13. but not the Word of Faith; and yet saith in <hi>page</hi> 45. That Christ <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> If Christ be the Word of God, and faith come by Hearing, and Hearing by the Word of God, then how is it that he is not the word of Faith, being that word by which Faith comes when it is heard? and he being the Author of it, may he not then as well be called the Word of it, as the Author of it, seeing he is the Word by which it comes? but that all may understand what this word of faith was which the Apostle preached. This was Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. and they preached no other Word to be the Word of faith but Christ, That whosoever believed on him should not be ashamed: So that if the

ignorance of Christ and of the Apostles words, were blotted out of the hearts of our Accusers, they would be silent, and the daily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach would cease.</p>
               <p>And whereas it is affirmed by us, That the Light, or a measure of Christ within, is a sure word of prophesie, or a more sure word of prophesie, as <hi>Peter</hi> saith, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1, 19. And whereas many are offended at this, and labours to make people believe that this is the Writings of the Prophets which is the more sure Word of Prophesie the Apostle speaks of because he saith, <hi>Knowing this first, that no prophesie of the Scriptures is of any private interpretation; for the prophesie came not in old time by the will of man, but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Ghost, &amp;c.</hi>

This was a sure Word when it was spoken, and when it was written, it was a sure testimony, as sure as any of the Prophets Writings; for the Prophets did see that he was to come, and he that was to come was the well belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Son of the Father, and they wrote this down, and it was a sure testimony of Christ; and <hi>Peter</hi> and the rest saw that he was come, and did hear the voice from the excellent glory proclaiming him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

But although the Apostles words and writings were confirmed with more power and witness of the Spirit then the Prophets, and both true, yet the Apostles Ministry unto those which did not see those things which

It was more sure for them to take heed unto that which was as a light shining in a dark place, till the day-star did arise, and the day dawn in their hearts; then the declaration from others without them, declared in words and writings; as thus for example, by experience; to su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So this may inform your understandings who may have more desire to know the truth, then to oppose it, and may put to silence the vain disputings by men of corrupt minds, who are destitute of the truth, always corrupting the words of truth to oppose the life of it, as many such there are in these days, which the Lord hath, and will rebuke sharply, that they may be ashamed; but all vvho are led and guided by the light of Christ shall knovv the anointing in them, and the vvord of faith, yea the Son of God: He that can receive it vvithout offence, let him.</p>

So that if words had been that which would have finished the work, the Land had been cleansed before this time of that abomination; but the Lord hath brought a tryal upon such spirits, whether they will own their testimony through the spoiling of their Goods, and imprisonment of their bodys; and therefore hath God suffered an earthly power, &amp; a Law to try them, and now they do rather deny their Testimony, then suffer by that Law which gives the Priests tithes; as for Witnesses, most of the baptized people in England have betrayed their testimony and profession in that thing: And how are you worthy to be called Saints which bear such a testimony? can this equally be compared with the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Saints of old? Did they cry down false worships and
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:61974:132"/>
false teachers in words? and did they uphold them by giving them wages? Have you not herein sinned against light? Did you not once see that they were never sent of God? And will you now uphold them because you cannot suffer for your testimony? Is not your paying them wages, &amp; giving them tithes, a greater witness for them then your preaching them down in words is against them? and may they not herein rejoyce over you? Christ is not herein your exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which for this end was born, and for this end came into the world, to bear witness to the truth, and did finish the work which the Father had given him to do, and was made perfect through sufferings; but such never need suffer who preach down deceit in words, and hold it up in workes. And the Apostles is not your example; for they were in workes that which they declared in words: therefore hath God cast you by, as not fit to be La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers in his Vineyard: But a people is the Lord raising up, whom he is giving his holy spirit unto, whose witness to him must stand as well in works as in words, who love the truth more then their lives or liberties, goods or estates, and are valiant for it upon the earth, which cannot be subject to the powers of darkness, nor the Rulers of the darkness of this world, but believeth that whatsoever they deny for Christ in this life, they shall receive a hundred fold, and in the world to come life everlasting. And these are they whom the Father will exercise with his holy spirit, in the gathering his seed from the ends of the earth, and for the turning of many to righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness; and such shall shine as the stars in the firmament of Heaven, when as the false and deceitfull witnesses shall be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into darknesse because their testimony is not able to endure the tryal; for the Lords house must be built with tried stones, that the winds of persecutions cannot blow it down: and upon such will his light arise, who when they are tried, are found faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and who are counted worthy to bear a testimony in this work though it be through sufferings in this day, when the powers of the Earth have set themselves to wear out the Saints of the most High God by changing times and Laws, whereby to restrain the liberty of the Lords people whose worship stands in the spirit, and in the truth.

               <p>IT being of the Lord so ordered, that a publike Dispute was appointed betwixt <hi>Thomas Dance</hi> Priest in <hi>Sandwich</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> and those called <hi>Quakers,</hi> which was upon the twelfth and thirteenth days of the second Month, in which many weighty things concerning Religion was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scoursed of; in which it was first proved by us according to the Scripture, That Christ Jesus the true Light, hath enlightened every one that cometh into the world, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.9. and <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. And another weighty matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Religion discoursed upon, was the righteousness by which man is justified before God, which by us was witnessed and proved to be only by the righteousness that was in Christ Jesus, being also made manifest in us, the everlasting righteousness being brought in, according to <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.24. Again upon the tenth day the discourse was, Whether the Scriptures were the Word of God: The answer was, That the Scriptures were Writings, and the Writings was not the Word, but the thing written of was the Word of God: Unto which the Priests also consented. Another thing was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Call to the Ministry, whether theirs or ours was according to the Apostles, and according to the Scriptures; the heads of both which Calls are declared as followeth, that all people may judge according to their measure of the gift of Christ, whether of them is according to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Testimony.</p>

               <p>THat by which the Apostles were called into the Work of the Ministry, having gifts differing according to the measure of the manifestation of Christ, by the same am I called, which is also according to the Scriptures, as <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Then the Apostles spake non-sence when they witnessed forth their call to the Ministry; for to every one of them was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Grace, according to the measure of the gift of Christ, from which Grace they did minister, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Then he pretends to nothing of the Spirit of God, much less to be a Minister of the Spirit, as <hi>Paul</hi> was, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6.

                  </gap> that which is fallible is deceivable; and whosoever is taught by that Spirit, is deceived; and <hi>Thomas Dance</hi> pretends to have no other Spirit but that which is deceivable and fallible; so that it is time to turn away from such.</p>
               <p>Again, he chargeth <hi>Timothy</hi> that he was not infallible; which is a false charge: For wherein was he fallible or deceivable? but he was so infallible, that he not neglecting the gift of God that was in him, he by it was able to save himself and those that heard him, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4 16. And he ministred from the gift of God in him, which he had received by prophesie, and so not from a fallible spirit, but from the infallible; and so he is accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed falsly by <hi>T.

apparel? and in that apparel which thou art already cloathed with, wilt thou be condemned when thou comes to know any measure of the gift of the true Ministry to be thy guide.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> All the people that were in place, and some more, may seal it to be fallible and deceivable, as thou hast confessed it to be; but there is not one that can set to their seal that it hath brought them to a perfect man, nor to the knolwedge of the Son of <hi>God,</hi> nor to the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ; and so it hath not effected any of the Work of the true Ministry; but when thou comes to be searched narrowly, filthy lucre wil be found to be the end for which thou Ministrest, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which thou wouldst be silent.</p>
               <p>And now further to manifest that, that he pretends not to any thing of the infallible Spirit in his Ministry, these his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples or doctrines declare as followeth, with the answer of truth to them.</p>
               <p>Pr. <hi>That every individual man was not enlightened by Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Which doctrine is contrary to <hi>John</hi> 1.9. which saith, <hi>that was the true Light which enlighteneth every one that cometh into the world</hi>; and to pervert the Scripture, he gave two meanings, that the people might take whether they would, so that they would but deny the form of sound words, and the plain Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: The first was this, That <hi>Christ enlightened every man that is enlightened.</hi> Or else, Secondly, That <hi>he enlighteneth some in every Nation.</hi> Now let people consider how that this can be the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Holy Ghost, as he said it was, seeing that here is two meanings, and it is either the one or the other, but he knows not which; which doth plainly manifest that he hath not the mind of the Spirit, which is but one, and speaks as it means; but the Scriptures cannot be broken by such meanings, which saith, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Pr. <hi>That the whole body of the Gentiles was not enlightened.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Then by what shall those Gentiles be condemned who are not enlightened, seeing that Christ was given for a Light to the Gentiles, as the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> saith? But he doth not say, to some of the Gentiles, and not to the whole body; and
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:61974:137"/>
though the Gentiles were once darkness, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. yet the Light shined in the darkness; and the Apostle turned them unto that Light which shined in the darkness, that the eye which was blinded, might be opened: He did not come to give them eyes, but to open the blind eyes; not to give them light, but to turn them to the Light that was in them, as <hi>Acts</hi> 26.10.</p>
               <p>Pr. <hi>That the Gospel is an external Light, and not invisible; and that it is not th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Which is contrary to the Apostles doctrine, which saith the gospel is the power of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. which is not external nor visible, but invisible, and shined in their hearts, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. and it was hid unto those that were lost; but that which was vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, they could see and hear with the visible eyes and ears; but both the Gospel which is the power of God, and the eye that sees, are invisible.</p>
               <p>Pr. <hi>That Christ being the propitiation for the sins of the whole world, as</hi> John <hi>said,</hi> 1 John 2.2. <hi>is meant onely the world of believers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> In this he would break the Scriptures, and contradict the Apostle, which saith, <hi>He is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours onely</hi> (who were the believers) <hi>but for the sins of the whole world</hi>; Which whole World, <hi>John</hi> said lies in wickedness; but the whole World of believers lies not in wickednesse, but is of God</p>
               <p>Pr. <hi>That they must reconcile the Scriptures.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The Scriptures cannot be broken, <hi>John</hi> 10.35. but is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled and at unity in themselves, and in all those that know them; but he that gives two contrary meanings to one Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he doth not go about to reconcile, but rather to pervert them, and to take away the plain testimony of truth (which they give) from peoples understandings; but the key of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is found again, which opens the Scriptures <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

               <p>Pr. <hi>That the Law of the Spirit of Life in Christ, was not the Law of the Spirit in the Saints, but that they were two Laws, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <pb n="210" facs="tcp:61974:138"/>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> This is a false distinction; for God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ath said that <hi>he wil write his Law in their hearts, and put his Spirit in their inward parts</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And the same Law of the Spirit of Life in Christ Jesus, being in the Apostle's heart, had set him free from the Law of sin and death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.2. So it was not two Laws, but one Law.</p>
               <p>Pr. <hi>That there are two righteousnesses of Christ, the one without the Saints, to justifie thom; and the other within the Saints, that did san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Christ's righteousness is but one, and that by which they were both sanctified and justified, was but one thing, even the Spirit of our God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. and Christ in them was Gods righteousness, and the hope of glory, who was made unto them righteousness, and if Christ was in them, then his righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness was in them; or else he and his righteousness is divided, as this Priests doctrine would make them.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> If they were not justified by that Christ that was in them, then by another Christ, which is no less than to preach two Christ's; and so he hath preached another Gospel than the Apostles preached, which whosoever doth, is accursed.</p>
               <p>Pr. <hi>That</hi> David <hi>when he was guilty of adultery and murther, was not in a condemned state, but in a justified state.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Here he would make God a justifier of the wicked in his wickedness; but in that state <hi>David</hi> was condemned of the Lord, and suffered his anger and terrors, when his iniquities went over his head, and were too heavy for him to bear; and he was not justified until that through judgement he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Thus by his false meanings he hath often perverted the Scriptures, calling his false meanings the meanings of the Holy Ghost; but these mentioned in <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. were them the Apostle wrote unto upon earth; for he did not write to men after they were deceased; and these that he wrote unto, were come unto the <hi>innumerable company of Angels, and to the City of the living God, and to the spirits of just men made perfect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Pr. <hi>That any creature that holds that principle of being justified by a righteousness within, living and dying in that principle, cannot come to Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Christ is the justifier of them that believe in him, and his Doctrine is, <hi>I in them, and they in me</hi>: So Christ and his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness is in the Saints, and God hath brought in the everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing righteousness, which justifieth, which is not at a distance, separate from the Saints, as these false Teachers have imagined. And the Apostles Doctrine and Principle is <hi>Christ in you,</hi> which whosoever liveth and dyeth in this, comes to Heaven; but on the contrary, whosoever hath not Christ and his righteousness in them, to justifie them, cannot come to Heaven.</p>
               <p>Pr. <hi>That, that which fitted men for the Inheritance (among the Saints) did not entitle to the inheritance, or not give them a part in the inheritance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> This is contrary to the Apostles Doctrine; for he thanks God the Father, who made them meet to be partakers of the inheritance with the Saints in Light, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.12. for he both fitted them for the Inheritance, and did entitle and give them a part in the Inheritance, <hi>translating them into the Kingdom of his dear Son,</hi> ver. 13.</p>
               <p>Pr. <hi>That we cannot contain an infinite righteousness in us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Then you cannot contain the righteousness of God, for it is infinite and everlasting, as in <hi>Daniel</hi> 9.24. and then you cannot contain Christ in you, who is God's righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and who is infinite; and so by this Doctrine he makes
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:61974:139"/>
all reprobates, as all are who know not Christ in them; for they who did not retain God in their knowledge, were given up to a reprobate sence.</p>
               <p>Pr. <hi>That it was false doctrine to say a man must first partake of the righteousness which justifies, before it can be imputed to him as his.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> He hath here counted that false doctrine which the Saints witnessed fulfilled in them; for the righteousness of God was imputed to the Saints in the true belief, whereby they did partake of Gods righteousness through Faith, before it could be accounted theirs; except that this Priest in his false mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings would count that to be a mans vvhich he hath no right to, nor part in; for the faith wherein <hi>Abraham</hi> did partake of Gods righteousness, vvas reckoned to him for righteousness; and he unto vvhom God imputeth righteousness, in his spirit there is no guile; though these Priests vvould impute righteousnesse to the vvicked, as theirs, vvho are full of guile and sin, having no life, nor right in God's righteousness, vvhile they live quite out of it.</p>
               <p>Pr. <hi>That God offers salvation to all men, but he intends it but to a few.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> There he vvould frustrate the grace of God, and his salvation, vvhich is free for all; and so he vvould make the offers of God's salvation to many thousands, to no purpose, as if God profered that to many vvhich he never intended to give them: Was there ever such a belying of God as this? For vvhat is it less than to make God a respecter of persons? If all men by nature be in wickedness, and liable to condemnation, as this priest confessed, and yet salvation is intended but for a fevv, (though offered to all) how is God no respecter of persons? and how is Christ given <hi>to be his salvation to the ends of the earth, and a Light unto the world, that all men through him might believe?</hi> and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever believeth in Christ, shall not perish, but have everlasting life; so that all may freely come and be saved, according to the Love and Will of God, vvho doth not intend that any shall perish except they reject his vvay, and the offers of his grace, which hath appeared to all men.</p>
               <p>Pr. <hi>That a Minister of the gospel doth not know who are elected.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> There he hath belyed the Ministers of the gospel; for they could discern the elect from the World, as it is written, <hi>Ye shall discern between him that serveth God, and him that serveth him
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:61974:139"/>
not</hi>; and <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> vvrote to the Elect: So these Teachers vvho knovv not the Elect, and yet exhort all their hearers to believe and lay hold on Christ, their preaching is in vain; for if God hath but intended a certain number to be saved, and the rest to be condemned, then they set their Hearers on work in vain, and many to expect that vvhich they are never like to have: So these people are in a miserable state. And note, that these Priests though they take sums of money and tythes of their Hearers in many parishes in the Nation, yet they know not vvho are elected among them, according to this mans words.</p>
               <p>Pr. <hi>That the Sword of the Spirit is ineffectual without the Letter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The Svvord of the Spirit is the Word of God, vvhich vvas effectual before the Letter vvas, to <hi>Enoch,</hi> to <hi>Isaac,</hi> to <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and others; and from the Word vvas the Letter given forth, and the Letter is not effectual without it.</p>

               <p>Pr. <hi>That there was no Scripture <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Those Scriptures which are not bound up in the Bible, were given forth from the same spirit, and by the motion of the Holy Ghost, and so for the same ends and uses that the other Scripture was given forth for; and as he appointed the one, so the other.</p>
               <p>Pr. <hi>That the Letter doth antecede and go before the spirit in all that walk in the spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> This is false, for the spirit did antecede the Letter in all that walked in the spirit, who gave forth the Letter from the spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:61974:140"/>Pr. <hi>That the works of Christ in some respect are not perfect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> That is false, for <hi>every gift of God is perfect</hi>; and every work of Christ is perfect in all his children; but that spirit in thee which is fallible, makes nothing perfect, and therefore judgeth all things, yea Christ and his Works to be fallible and deceivable, like it self.</p>
               <p>Pr. <hi>That the Law requires more strict and exact obedience than the Gospel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Nay; The Law saith, <hi>Thou shalt not commit adultery</hi>; but the Gospel saith, <hi>Thou shalt not lust</hi>: The Law saith, <hi>Thou shalt not kill</hi>; but the Gospel saith, <hi>Thou shalt not be angry.</hi> The Law saith; <hi>Thou shalt not forswear thy self</hi>; but the Gospel saith, <hi>Swear not at all,</hi> Matth. 5. And so the Gospel requires more exact obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience then the Law, contrary to this affirmation.</p>
               <p>Pr. <hi>That God chose a Devil to be one of his Ministers, in chusing</hi> Judas; and his proof for it is this, <hi>That the Divine Natu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> This is a charging of Christ with ignorance, contrary unto <hi>John</hi> 2.24.25. which saith, <hi>That Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all men, and needed not that any should testifie of man, for he knew what was in man</hi>: And though <hi>Judas</hi> by transgression became a Devil, and the Devil abode not in the Truth, doth it therefore follow that he was never in the truth? But Christ speaks of him, and to him, as well as to the rest, that they had power to cast out unclean spirits, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.1. and that the Spirit of the Father spoke in them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.20. So that there was no difference while the Spirit of the Father led him and taught, till the Devil entered into his heart to betray that Lord of Life. So that is a false charge to say, That Christ sent out a Devil to minister the Gospel.</p>
               <p>Pr. <hi>That the Spirit of God may accompany a Ministry, and the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister not have the Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> This is another Doctrine than ever the Prophets or Apostles preached; for I never read in the Scripture, that ever any did minister for God, which had not the Spirit, or that ever any was converted unto God by such a Minister as had not the Spirit: Therefore prove this assertion to the
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:61974:140"/>
people, where, or when the Spirit of God did accompany that Ministry, when the Minister had not the Spirit; so that thou m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Pr. <hi>That the power that went forth in the Apostles Ministry, was in God, and not in them; but as they have it communicated to them by the exercise of Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Here thou hast confounded thy self; for if they had it communicated to them by their exercise of Faith, then it was in them; for the exercise of Faith is within, in the pure Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science; and so the power was in them, from which they mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred, and they did not abuse their power, but from the power ministred forth their gift as they had received it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thomas Ramsay</hi> said, That we preach a Doctrine of Devils, in saying that men may be free from sin in this life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Then the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> preached a Doctrine of Devils: For he said, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6 2. <hi>How shall we that are dead to sin, live any longer therein</hi>? And in the 7<hi>th.</hi> verse saith, <hi>He that is dead, is free from sin.</hi> And in the 18<hi>th</hi> verse he saith to the Believers, being then made free from sin, <hi>Ye became the servants of righteousness</hi>; &amp; in ver. 22. he again tells them, That <hi>now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, you have your fruits unto holiness, and the end everlasting life</hi>: And this was spoken to the <hi>Romans</hi> while they were in this life, and it was not a Doctrine of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, but the Doctrine of the Gospel; and Christ preached the Doctrine of perfection in this life, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.48. saying, <hi>Be ye per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect as your Father which is in Heaven is perfect</hi>; and also it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, <hi>Be ye holy, for I am holy,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.16. And this is not a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Devils, but of Christ the Son of God; and <hi>Paul</hi> preached Wisdom among those that were perfect; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2 6. and <hi>David</hi> preached the Doctrine of perfection in this life, saying, <hi>Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright, for the end of that man is peace,</hi> Psal. 37.37. Now <hi>David</hi> did not bid them mark such a man as there was not: So the Doctrine of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is that Doctrine which both the Prophets, Christ and
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:61974:141"/>
Apostles preached, and so not the Doctrine of Devils, if we preach the same; but all those that preach up sin, and that men must live in it, and that they cannot be free from it while upon earth, these are Messengers of Satan, and preach the Doctrine of Devils, and people need not that doctrine; for they are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling enough to live in sin, without having it preached up, and being strengthened in it; and that makes them so willing to pay the Priests such Wages, for calling the proud happy; and those that work wickedness, Saints and justified persons; for without such Wages not a priest in <hi>England</hi> would preach peace to them in their sins, but they would all be silent; for if people come once to know Christ their Teacher, and he in them the hope of glory, who saves his people from their sins, then no man wil buy their merchandize any more, but wil come all to hear and learn of the Father, and come to witness his Covenant and his Teachings, and shall not need that one teach another, saying, <hi>Know the Lord, for all shall know him from the least to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, Heb.</hi> 8.11. And this shall all come to witness that come to be translated into the Kingdom of the dear Son of God; and then shall they come to witness his Words who is the Lord from Heaven, who saith, <hi>Be ye perfect as your Father which is in Heaven is perfect; and be ye holy, for I am holy.</hi> And this is the voice from Heaven.</p>

            <p>That every one that will minister, must do it freely, and as of the ability which God giveth him, and as the Oracle of God, and that no profession of people may maintain anothers Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster; but that there may be a free preaching, and a free hearing among all people, that so it may be a free Nation; and they that will have Teachers according to their own lusts and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they to maintain them; and that there may never any such iniquity be established by a Law, as for one sort of people to maintain anothers Minister; for this hath caused heart-burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, envy and strife, insomuch that little Justice could be done for the Nation, by reason of the cry of complainers and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressors, as at every Parliament, every high Court, every Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes and Sessions, and petty Courts, there hath some (pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) Minister or other been presenting Addresses, Petitions or

So let every form and profession of Religion maintain their own Minister, and maintain their poor which are crying at their Meeting-house doors, and in the Streets, in the Name of their God, for some relief; that so there may not be a beggar in <hi>England</hi>; for herein the Christians in name, are become even a reproach among the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, to see their own flesh stand naked and uncovered in the streets and Steeple-house doors, and at their doors, and they turn their ears from the poor, and forget God, and loses the bowels of compassion, and are not merciful as the Father which is in Heaven is merci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So let no more the cry of the Priests nor of the poor be heard in our Land, the one crying for Laws to persecute and receive money of those who they preach not unto, which receives no teaching from them; which cry is intolerable to be heard or suffered in a free Common-wealth: And the other for want of the creatures of God, when as others spend the creatures of God upon their lusts excessively; and so the Creation is out of order. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

freely, <hi>which was added upon all transgression</hi>: So in those days there were no Priests that troubled the Courts, Judges nor Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors with Addresses, Petitions or Complaints for maintenance; no suing at the Law, no imprisoning mens persons for Wages, nor no spoiling of mens goods, and there was not such delays in executing judgment upon transgressors, as is now; for the Judges sate in the gate, and executed judgement speedily up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the offendors, and cleansed the Land of evil-doers, and so eve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now see that sin and covetousness is a reproach to any people, as <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, Prov. 14.22. and it is that which brings them into bondage from being a free peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Now if none may minister the Law, but those that do it freely as unto the Lord, and as his Ministers, then that covetous self-seeking spirit will be purged out in Judges, Counsellors, Lawyers, Attorneys and Solicitors, which would devour the Creation to spend upon their ovvn lusts, that seek for great places to enrich themselves, and destroy others; so that Equity, Law and Justice is lost, and the free ministration of it in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; so that in many cases a man had better suffer himself to be defrauded, then to seek to the Law for Justice, the administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it is become so corrupt; and the Law is so perverted by them, that a man is not suffered to plead his own cause, but is forced to hire a Lawyer or an Attorney, and men are not suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to bear a true and faithful witness, nor to have the truth and

               <p>Now whereas in your late proceedings it is ordered &amp; granted, <hi>that every one shall have their free liberty, first as an English man; second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as a Christian</hi>: Which liberty hitherto we have not enjoyed; for as English men we have not had our just liberty in the Nation; first, as concerning the Law; secondly, as concerning the worship of God; for in this our own Nation, &amp; in our own Counties, where we have been wel known (&amp; also just and true, &amp; of good report, and no evil justly laid to our charge) have we been shamefully abused, whipped, stoned, prisoned, and both our bodies &amp; goods spoiled, accounted as vagrants, and not permitted as English men, to have the liberty of the Law, because we as Christians, could not transgress the commandment of Christ, which saith, <hi>Swear not at all</hi>: So that if we may have our liberty as English men, then not to be persecuted in our own country as vagrants, where we are known to be no such persons: And from hence let a true testimony in yea or nay, be taken in our Law without an oath; for he that can take liberty to swear, &amp; so to break Christ's command, wil take liberty to lye also.

            </p>
            <p>Unto the first of which you say, <hi>Though we cannot answer in justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of every individual person that is of our profession in matters of Religion, yet we can say this, and prove it to all the world, that it hath been our profession, and is our real practise to be obedient to Magistracy in all things Civil, and willing to live peaceably under whatever Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is, or shall be established in this Nation: For we do believe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare Magistracy to be an Ordinance of God, and ought to be obeyed in all lawful things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> For you to give up your selves willingly and peaceably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whatsoever Government is, or shall be established in this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without any limitation, and to submit unto any Power or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracy that doth or shall rule, as the Ordinance of God, without
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:61974:146"/>
any limitation or qualification, is far below that Spirit which was once in some of you in that profession; for you have told of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Laws regulated according to the Scriptures, and of having Judges as at the first, and Counsellors as at the beginning; and then not to submit to what Government soever, but that which is according to Equity and Justice. And what do you bear Arms, or fight for, if not for a Government according to truth, and that Righteousness may establish the Nation? Some have judged this to be the very Design and End of the War and Controversie against many that were Governors and Magistrates, and were by some called <hi>the Ordinance of God,</hi> and the <hi>higher Power</hi>: And if now you resolve to live peaceably, and submit to whatever Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment shall be establish<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d, then your Fighting is at end. And if any shall come in, and establish Popery, and govern by tyranny, you have begged pardon by promising willingly to submit and live peaceably under it as the Ordinance of God. And if <hi>Jerobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi> come to reign, and set up Calves to worship, and cause the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to sin, yet you will submit and live peaceably and quietly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, accounting it the Ordinance of God. And if a <hi>Pharoah</hi> come to rule, he that bears rule must be counted a Magistrate, and a Magistracy must be accounted the Ordinance of God by you, and peaceably submitted unto; and whatsoever Government they set up by their Act, wil be accounted lawful things, and you must submit to them, else you have proved your selves all lyars; but some did judge that ye had been of another spirit.</p>
            <p>To the second you say, <hi>As for the publick Ministry of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who differ from us in the matter of baptizing Infants, and some things in Church-Government, we are so far from endeavouring to destroy them, that we judge they ought to have the liberty of their consciences therein; and that it is our duty to stand by them and preserve them (so much as in us lies) from all injury and violence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> It seems then that there is not so much difference betwixt them and you, as will make them Antichristian, and you Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an; and there is a near compliance, when as it is your duty to stand by them and preserve them while they are baptizing Infants: But can you stand by them and preserve them, and not tell them that it is Antichristian, or contrary to the Scriptures? And do you think that they will do as much for you, as to stand by you while you are plunging your Members in the water? And although you
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:61974:146"/>
do so as you say; is not this contradiction to your selves in what you say in the same Paper? For do you not say, That <hi>you will not tolerate any miscarriages in things Civil or Religious</hi>? And whether is not this a miscarriage in things religious, to baptize Infants? And whether do you not tolerate this miscarr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>age in them, while you stand by to preserve them in it (as you say) from injury and violence? But who doth offer any violence to them which are their guard against? but the Priests will hardly believe you; and if they ever have power, that will not pardon you for so saying; and therefore you had better have been silent, than have shewed pour weakness and ignorance for nothing.</p>
            <p>To the third you say, <hi>Concerning the people called</hi> Quakers, <hi>it is well known unto all (that are not wilfully ignorant) there are none more opposite to their irregular practices than we are; nor are there any that they have exprest more contradiction to in matters of Religion, than against us, though their provocation therein, hath not put us in the least on a desire of depriving them of their just liberty, while they live morally honest and peaceable in the Nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Is not this secret smiting without a cause? What irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular practice is that which you accuse them of, and wil not mention? is this honestly done? What, are they worse than the Episcopal Priests you mention to them, wherein they differ from you? and why not to the <hi>Quakers</hi>? Is it enough for any man to believe that they are irregular, because you say so without any proof? Or dare you not mention wherein you judge it so, lest they should disprove you? But you say, there is not any they have expressed more contradiction to, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, than against you. <hi>Answ.</hi> That is false; for they have more contradicted the common Priests of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as their Books and sufferings will witness, although they have according to truth contradicted you, and also have more of your contradictions and confusions to declare concerning you, which are not yet published: But what do you account their irregular practice? Is it because their yea is yea, and their nay is nay in all their communications (and yours not so?) Or is it because they cannot swear at all? Or is it because they cannot have any mans person in admiration because of advantage, or because they cannot respect the person of the
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:61974:147"/>
rich, nor honor the person of the mighty? Is it because they do unto others as they would have others to do unto them? Or because they speak the truth every one to his Neighbour, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out partiality or hypocrisie? Or is it any thing relating to these things above-named? If not, in your next mention in what, or else the wise in heart wil judge you to sprak onely from your imaginary conceit. But what is your end in so secret smiting them? Do you think to excuse your selves by accusing them? And who is it that doth charge you in countenancing the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> in their practices either regular or irregular? I know none that hath any ground so to charge you: But to men of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing who can see beyond words, you rather appear to be begging a pardon of the <hi>Episcopal</hi> and <hi>Presbyter,</hi> and the vvild Boys and Apprentices of <hi>London,</hi> by accusing the <hi>Quakers,</hi> as hereafter will appear; and that fearfulness and unbelieving is entred into your hearts, and so your spirits are betrayed into a slavish fear; but if ever you be accepted or owned of God; you must own that for your strength which the <hi>Quakers</hi> live in; and if ever any rule for God in this Nation, they must own that Light, Life and Spirit which they are guided by, and then they will not despise, but have unity with the <hi>Quakers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the fourth you say, <hi>Whereas we are further charged with endeavouring an universal Toleration of all miscarriages both in things Religious and Civil, under pretence of Liberty of Conscience; it is in both respects notoriously false. And we do before the Lord that shall judge both quick and dead, yea before Angels and Men, declare our utter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation of such a Toleration; for in matters Civil we desire there may not be the least toleration of miscarriage in any, much less in our selves. Nor do we desire in matters of Religion, that Popery should be tolerated, the blood of many thousands of the People of God having been barbarous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shed by the Professors thereof; or any person tolerated that worship a false God, nor any that speak contemptuously and reproachfully of our Lord Jesus Christ, nor any that deny the holy Scriptures contained in the Books of the Old and New-Testament, to be the Word of God; and yet we are not against tolerating of Episcopacy, Presbyter, or any stinted form, provided they do not compel any others to a compliance therewith, or a conformity thereunto. For whatever Composers of any form of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, may possibly err, it is derogating from God and his holy Word,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:61974:147"/>
and injurious to men to compel any to the practice thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> What confusion is here, and contradiction both to your selves, and to the ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mple of Christ? As to Religion, you wil not tolerate Popery, because the blood of many of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God have been barbarously shed by the professors thereof; neither wil you have any persons tolerated that worship a false God; nor any that speak contemp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uously and reproachfully of the Lord Jesus Christ; nor any that deny the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures contained in the Books of the Old &amp; New-Testament, to be the Word of God. And yet you are not against tolerating of Episcopacy, Presbytery, or any stinted form: Why wil you not tolerate Popery as well as Episcopacy? Have not the professors of Episcopacy murthered and slain, and do labour to murther and slay the people of God, as well as the Papists? And why will you tolerate the Common-Prayer among the Episcopacy, and not the Mass-Book among the Papists, seeing that the Mass was the substance out of which the Common-prayer was extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted? Here is nothing but partiality, to tolerate one thing and not another of the same kind: And why will you not tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the persons of those that worship a false God, nor the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of those that deny the Scriptures to be the Word of God, nor the persons of those that speak contemptuously and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfully of the Lord Jesus Christ?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> If you will not tolerate their persons, then you will murther or destroy their persons; and herein you have proved the accusation against you to be true, that you have a design to murther and destroy those that differ from you in matters of Religion: As for instance, those that worship a false God, they differ from you in matters of Religion, and you will not have any of their persons tolerated, and their persons must be destroyed for differing from you in matters of Religion. And they that deny the Scriptures (that is, the Writings) to be the Word of God, (that is, to be Christ, whose Name is called the Word of God) you will not tolerate their persons, then you will destroy them, because they differ from you in matters of Religion. And those that speak reproachfully of Jesus Christ, you wil not tolerate their persons, then you wil destroy their persons because they differ from you in matters of Religion.
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:61974:148"/>
and thus having contradicted your selves, you have also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted the example of Christ; for he came among those that worshipped false Gods, even stocks and stones, and graven Images, the Works of mens hands; and he was not against to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerating their persons, neither came he to destroy mens lives because of such things, but had a Gospel to preach unto them, whereby they might learn to know the living God, and turn from dumb Idols, and those that speak reproachfully against him, and said he had a Devil; yet he was not against tolerating their persons, but preached the Kingdom of God to them, and did bid them seek it, and the righteousness thereof; and told them that the Kingdom of God was within them; and he w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s among such as denied that there was a God, or Christ, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, Angel or Spirit; and this is more than to deny the Scriptures to be the Word of God, which indeed is words, and not the Word. And Christ was not against tolerating of any of the persons, as you have expressed your selves to be, and so shewed forth a murthering Spirit: But seeing that you wil not have any person tolerated that worships a false God, what must be done vvith their persons? But what difference is there (in the ground or cause of toleration) between those that vvorship a false god, or they vvhich vvorship the true God in a false vvay? And if the persons of neither of those should be tolerated, then the toleration vvould but reach a little compass But vvho must be Judge of that blasphemy, contempt or reproach spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken against the Lord Jesus Christ? Was it not blasphemy in the Apostles days for one to say he was a <hi>Jew,</hi> and was not? <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 9 And is it not as great blasphemy now to say that he is a Christian or a Believer, that is not? And must not any person be tolerated that speak such vvords? And must not such a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son be tolerated that denies the Scriptures to be the Word of God? Then it appears they must not be tolerated that say, <hi>In the beginning was the Word,</hi> as <hi>John</hi> 1.4. Nor that say that Christ is the Word, and that the Scriptures are they which testifie of him, as <hi>John</hi> 5.

and New-Testament to be the Word of God, but do confesse them to be a Testimony of the Word, and of him who is the beginning and end of the words, in whom, and by whom they all come to be fulfilled to the Saints: What must their persons be done with, seeing they must not be tolerated?

            <p>To the last you say, <hi>Forasmuch as we are charged to murder and destroy those that differ from us in matters of Religion, We do not only abhor and detest it as a cursed practice, but we hope we have approved our selves both in this City and the Nation, to the contrary; notwithstanding the great provocation of some who have endeavoured our ruine. For that we desire is, just liberty to men as men; that every man may be preserved in his own just rights; and that Christians may be preserved as Christians, though of different apprehensions in some things of Religion; in the prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution whereof, our lives shall not be dear unto us, when we are thereunto lawfully called.

And as for some of them whom ye would accuse as irregular, many by experience can witness, that neither Weapon nor Tongue form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed against them, can prosper; and the time may come when you may be glad to be upholden with a little of their strength, and not to reject those whom God hath, doth, and will own for his people in the midst of their Enemies; for God hath made them
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:61974:149"/>
even as eyes to behold the spirits of men, and the changings of their ways, and to give them a reproof in due season, when they darken Wisdom, and confound their matter by words without knowledge, in false fears and haste, when they are out of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and out of Faith in God, as the <hi>Baptists</hi> here have done; and the fearful and unbelieving cannot accomplish the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of God, neither will he bring forth his intended Work by them; but such as are of a true Spirit, that look only at the glory of God, and setting up of his Truth, who are come to the spiritual Weapons, and do not wrestle with flesh and blood, but with the powers of darkness, and with spiritual wickedness, and such as are not false accusers of others, but seek the good of all men, such will the Lord honor and exalt in his Work, and they shall perfect his praise.</p>
            <p>So Friends, you have been hasty to utter words before the Lord, for which his reproof justly comes upon you: Therefore let your words be few, &amp; mind the fear of the Lord God, which is the beginning of wisdom, and that will slay your false fears, from which unsavoury and unsound words hath proceeded; for your Religion is vain while your tongue is not bridled; for it is better to be still and keep silence, then to utter words from the line of confusion (that is stretched over you) thereby to get a name in the Earth; which Line all people walk in, but those who are led by the Spirit of God to speak words that cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned; for it is the Spirit of the Lord God and his Power, which must slay the enmity in you, which is the ground of your prejudice and hard speeches against the Lambs of Christ; which when that is slain within, then those evil fruits of the lips will cease without, and then the fountain of Life will open in you, which brings forth fruits of another nature; and when the fruits of your lips is truth, righteousness and peace, then wil you have fellowship with the Father and the Son, and with us who walk in his Light.</p>

            <head>A word of Wisdom and Counsel to the Officers and Souldiers of the Army in <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c. To weigh and consider before the light and power of their day be shut up in darkness when they cannot Act for God.</head>
            <p>THe people of this Commonwealth hath by deep and sad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences not onely seen the falseness and deceivableness of many fair words and pretences, whereby they have been betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of their liberties and freedom, and nothing yet but bondage and slavery is left upon them, but they also through their deep sufferings have learned to know the spirits of men. And though every appearance of a Power that ariseth gets new words and fair pretences, but still in the old spirit: Yet we do perfectly know, that it is the new Spirit of the Lord put in the inward parts, from which men must act for the Lord and for the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his people, before they be established in righteousness, or enjoy the liberty of their Consciences. And we see that God hath given time and days, which should have been days of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and of plenteous redemption: But through mens departing from the leadings of God, and suffering their own wisdom to pervert them, they became days of persecution and cruelty, which for the Elects sake (which suffered in them) was short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; as for instance;</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Oliver Cromwel</hi> in his days made many Vows, Promises, Engagements and Professions for the liberty of tender Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, as the honest people of this Nation are not ignorant; and how that at <hi>Dunbar,</hi> he confest unto God in his prayer, <hi>That if the Lord would but deliver him that time, he would take away that great oppression of Tithes</hi>; which when he was delivered, both at that and many other times, and had a prize put into his hand,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:61974:151"/>
yet had no heart to improve it; but contrary to all his prayers, promises and engagements, suffered and tolerated the wicked spirit of persecution, in the murthering Priests and Magistrates to Rule in the Land over tender Consciences, even until violence and blood covered the earth and filled the whole Nation, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Laws to be made for <hi>Tythes,</hi> and for persecuting of tender Consciences, and so building again that which he had destroyed, and so made himself a Transgressor; but for the elects sake his dayes were shortened.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In the dayes of <hi>R. Cromwell</hi> many of that succeeding Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament began to declare their sensibleness, how that <hi>O. Cromwel</hi> had betrayed the Nation and its Liberty, and left them in great bondage, debt, persecution and slavery; But how soon they were perverted, and became more bloody and cruel against all that fear God, (the upright in heart are sensible) setting up in themselves that which they declared against in him, and instead of giving liberty and freedom to the Army and to the people of God, they voted down that liberty and freedom which they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready had <hi>(viz.)</hi> of meeting together one with another in the fear and worship of God, &amp; so they became cruel as the Ostrich in the Wildernesse, and as evening Wolves; but for the Elects sake was their dayes shortened.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The long and late Parl. they came up with greater pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of liberty and freedom, then all that was before them and the people generally applauding of them, by telling them that they were the beginners of setling the Nation in the way of a Common wealth; and did expect they should perfect the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Liberty and Freedom outwardly (which by the other Powers they had suffered under) expecting that they should remove those burthens which was laid upon tender Consciences by impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions and cruel sufferings, and in their beginning they seemed to be given up to do the work expected from them, and did publish it in their weekly news to the Nation several times, that it was their real intent to make the Nation a Free Common-wealth, not in name but in Nature, and this was often expressed by them; and indeed they did something more then those that went before them, in setting at Liberty those that were imprisoned because they could not pay <hi>Tythes</hi> to the Priests; and because they could not swear, and because they could not put off their hats to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

Cromwell,</hi> if alive, would witnesse, or those that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live may witnesse for him, that he had never been such a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-breaker and betrayer of the Nations Liberties, but by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in that wicked interest, which made him a reproach, a by-word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a hissing among the people. And the two late Parliaments, it was their joyning to that betraying interest of the Priests, and neglecting of the Nations businesse that brought darkenesse and confusion, and consequently a dissolution upon them: And the last as I said, did something more then the former; But when they began to revive the Committee for plundred Ministers, and did not take notice, nor call any Committee to subdue or punish the plundering Ministers, of which they were informed from divers parts of the Nation, which had feloniously taken away the goods of many an honest innocent man; then did Gods Indignation grow hot against them, and then was it time for them to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved; for they had finished their day, and they had done all that ever they would have done for the Lord; for bonds and violence was in their hearts, but for the Elects sake, which hath alwayes borne a true Testimony against the oppression and cruelty under which the Innocent suffers, was their days shortened.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>All those before mentioned had their day from the Lord given them to try and to prove them, and they have been tried and proved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now you the Army have your day from the Lord, wherein you will be tried and proved; and you will be more inexcusable if you do not the things pretended, then any that hath been before you; for you see what hath been the cause of the fall; and you see how that through Pride and Ambition, flatteries and fair preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the Cause of God, and the Peoples Liberties have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed by those that have fought honour one of another, and not the honour which belongs unto God onely; Therefore if you would have the Lord to honour you, and keep you in renown in the Nation, seek not your selves, but deny your own Lordships

honours and Excellencies, let none cleave unto you by flatteries, in giving you titles in seeming respect and honors, for that will betray you, and lead you from that Innocency by which you should act for the Lord; and as now you have Power, exercise it, in chusing men fearing God, and hating covetousnesse, ambition, pride and honor, that so the Nation may enjoy that Liberty and Feedom which they have long waited for, and suffer none to act that persecution in your names which hath already covered the Nation with blackness and darknesse, and hath brought Gods curse upon their proceedings.</p>
            <p>One thing is upon me to acquaint you with, which many of you it may be doth not know, which is this; One of the little horns which pushed and persecuted the Lambs of Christ, is springing up again, and begins to be as fierce as ever; For yester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day in the Exchequor at <hi>Westminster</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Judge <hi>Parker</hi> and Judge <hi>Wilde</hi> would not receive a true answer from an honest man (who is well known for his uprightnesse) against a false Bill exhibited against him by a Priest, unlesse he would give it in upon Oath; and therefore because he could not swear for Conscience sake, but did testifie the Truth from his heart, he was committed Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner to the <hi>Fleet,</hi> and several others True and Just men, and Friends to the Common-wealth, was denied the Law, and their answers rejected, because they could not swear; but in whose names and by whose authority they act those things is not yet declared to the Nation: If those Judges act those things in the name and by the authority of the Army, or their late chosen Counsel, let it be openly manifest; and if not, but they did it in their own names, let the Nation know it; For this is worse then the last Parliament, who did set many free who where so impriso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and did give Commissions and receive Testimony without swearing; &amp; Judge <hi>Parker</hi> seems to have forgotten that knowledge and fidelity which he had of that people when he went his last cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit in the North, and his so favouring the Priests now, shews that he hath forgotten since he confest that he was Sermon-sick at <hi>Carlisle</hi> this last Summer, when he wished that a <hi>Quaker</hi> had been there, and saw that they had reason to declare against them, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But to us it is no strange thing to see men so apt to change and to betray their own knowledge for filthy lucre sake, while the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the Laws through bribery and deceit is upheld, which

            <p>Is it not a grievous thing, and intolerable to be born, that innocent and faithful men (who see and deny the Priests deceit) should be forced, whether by Law or Violence, to give them the tenth part of all their labours and increase, and they with that money to buy horse and arms to raise a Rebellion, to murther and destroy those men who deny to give them that which your Law hath caused to be taken from them, and so both the Law and Priesthood is joyned together in oppression of the people!</p>

               <p>IS it not a shame for thee, who art called a <hi>Baptist,</hi> thus to manifest thy self, and divide thy self from thy own people?

And why dost thou bring the Scripture that was spoken to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and apply it to the Christians? And why dost thou bring the Scripture where the Angel sware, but brings not the Scripture which saith, All Angels must worship the Son who saith, <hi>Swear not at all</hi>? So is not this like Antichrist, and Anti Apostle, that preaches up that which Christ and the Apostles denied, as in <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. <hi>James</hi> 5. And whereas thou saist in thy Epistle, that thy writing is short and indigested; in that thou hast said truly, for how can they that fear God digest it, seeing it is so contrary unto Christ and the

               <head>But on the contrary, from the Scripture it is proved, that the Believers and Christians are not to swear at all; Therefore to them that are in Christ Jesus no Oath is lawful.</head>
               <p>WE read in the Scriptures of truth, <hi>Matt.</hi> 5.19. That <hi>who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever breaketh the least commandment, and teacheth men so,</hi> he <hi>shall be least</hi> (or not at all) <hi>in the Kingdom of God.</hi>

               <p>But we do find some men, especially <hi>John Tombs</hi> breaking the commands of Christ, and teaching men so, therefore he is guilty of that judgment: but to the first proposition which is this:</p>

               <p>His proofs are these:</p>
               <p>That which is not <hi>de toto genere,</hi> in its whole kind evil, may be lawful; but swearing is not <hi>de toto genere,</hi> or in its whole kind e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil therefore some swearing may be lawful.</p>

                  <p>To break any of Christs commands, or to deny the Apostles Doctrine, is <hi>de toto genere,</hi> in its whole kind evil; but to swear at all by any Oath is to break the command of Christ, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Apostles doctrine, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.35, 36, 37. and <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.12.

                  <head>2 Argument.</head>
                  <p>That which is approved by God is lawful; but some swearing is approved by God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 63.11. Every one that sweareth by God shall glory; <hi>ergo.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> That Scripture <hi>Psal.</hi> 63.11. saith thus, but the King shall rejoyce in God; every one that sweareth by him shall glory; but the mouth of them that speak lyes shall be stopped. This was spoken of <hi>David</hi> the Anointed of God, who was in that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of the Law, wherein he might swear in truth and righteousness, that oath, As the Lord liveth, and as my soul liveth; but there was some in that time, which if they used that Oath, the Lord liveth, surely they swear falsly, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.2.</p>
                  <p>But what is that to the Christians under the new Covenant who are under Christs command, who saith, <hi>Swear not at all,</hi> neither by that oath which <hi>David</hi> and the Jews swore by, nor any other oath? but if upon any occasion they were required to testifie their obedience whether they would be subject to
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:61974:155"/>
such or such things, their answer was to be yea or nay, and to keep their words; which is more then the hypocrites and hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Priests in these times hath done by their oaths; for this we have good experience of, that such as do now plead to swear for a thing, hath sworn against the same thing, and do now preach against that which they have preached for, so that they will preach, pray, or swear any thing for their belly, and for filthy lucre; and the oath which <hi>David</hi> was to swear in truth and righteousness who called Christ Lord, he that was <hi>Davids</hi> Lord and glory saith, <hi>Swear not at all,</hi> who hath all power and glory.</p>
                  <p>Again, whereas <hi>John Tombs</hi> instanceth <hi>Abraham, Isaac, David, Solomon, Elijah, Micah, Elisha,</hi> the women of <hi>Shunem,</hi> and <hi>Itai, Uriah,</hi> and <hi>Samuel, &amp;c.</hi> their swearing and entring into covenant to be examples for swearing.</p>

                  <p>Again, To prove swearing lawful <hi>John Tombs</hi> saith that <hi>Paul</hi> put an oath on the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5.27. which words are these, <hi>I charge you by the Lord that this Epistle be read unto all the holy bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi>: Now saith <hi>Tombs</hi> the Greek word transl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> This is the long and thick mist of darkness which hath been long kept over the understandings of people, that when the plain Scripture will not prove their ends and intents, then they tell people it is otherwise in the Greek, or Hebrew; did not the Translator of the Bible understand Greek as well as <hi>John Tombs?</hi> or are we not to believe the Scripture as it speaks,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:61974:156"/>
till again it be translated by him? but lest he should be wise in his own eys, as it is in the Greek it is here set down, that all that can read and understand it, may judge whether <hi>Paul</hi> did put an Oath upon them, or did swear them to read that Epistle to the brethren.</p>
                  <p>As 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5.27. <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, that is, I oblige or charge you in the presence of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Not, I put the Lords oath upon you, or swear you, as <hi>John Tombs</hi> saith; for if they did read the Epistle among the brethren, then his obligation or charge to them was fulfilled; but seeing <hi>John Tombs</hi> saith he swore them, he might have declared in what manner they were sworn, seeing <hi>Paul</hi> was at <hi>Athens</hi> when he wrote to <hi>Thessalonica.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again he saith the like charge is in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.13. which accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Greek he would make an oath; the words are these, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that is, <hi>I enjoyn or command thee before God,</hi> not a putting an oath upon them, or causing them to swear, as <hi>John Tombs</hi> saith.</p>
                  <p>Again, he saith there is the like charge (or oath) put upon them in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1. which in the Greek is thus, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; that is, <hi>I charge thee in the presence of God,</hi> &amp;c. Not that he took him sworn, or put an oath upon him, that the should preach the word but did charge him to be instant in season<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and out of season in his Ministery.</p>
                  <p>Again <hi>John Tombs</hi> saith in the times of the Gospel <hi>Paul</hi> used this Oath 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.8. But as God is true, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Now those that mind this Scripture may see that <hi>Paul</hi> doth onely justifie Christs words in keeping to yea and nay, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that with him it was not yea and nay; for saith he, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. but as God is true, our word toward you was not yea and nay, and <hi>ver.</hi> 19. for the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, even by me and <hi>Sylvanus</hi> and <hi>Timotheus,</hi> was not yea and nay for all the promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen.</p>
                  <p>So that; this Scripture is so far from bringing people to Oaths and swearing that he labours to bring them all to yea and nay in all things, and so to Christ the substance, in whom all the promises of God are yea; so that the Apostle might well use these vvords, That as God vvas true, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> so also vvere they true to their yea and nay, the end of all oaths; other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

Now the things that I write unto you, behold before God <hi>I</hi> lye not, is this an oath to testifie the truth of his writings against lyes? indeed this we desire that <hi>John Tombs</hi> and the rest of the Priests in this Nation would write nothing but what God would witness unto the truth of, and that they would speak truth before God and not lye; then they would not thus abuse the Apostles words, and plead for swearing from them, when as the Apostles intend no such thing in their words here asserted: and whereas it is again said that the Apostle took and oath. <hi>Ph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now let all honest and sober-hearted men consider whether the truth of God and the Apostles that speak it forth be not abused, that from a novice that is lifted up in pride, and that would do or say any thing for his hire, he should bring those Scripture to plead for swearing and that lawfulnesse of oathes, in all which the Apostle took God to witnesse his love to the Saints and labour in the work of his ministry, signifying to all that understand how that he spoke the truth and did not lye, and kept to his yea and nay according to Christs doctrine (and did not swear at all.)</p>

And this good Confession we can witnesse before the King, or any in Authority, and say that God is our witnesse, and our Conscience also bears us witnesse in the sight of God, as the Apostle did, and we can say also that we speak the Truth before God, and lye not; for our eyes is not blinded with gifts and rewards, neither have we taken Oath, Covenants, nor Protestations for Parties, Powers, or Religions, but since we knew the way of Christ, we have walked in it, and kept to his Commandement &amp; Oath, which is yea &amp; nay in all things, &amp; so have not entred in condemnation with those that are given to change; but the unchangeable Priest, the unchangeable Covenant, and unchangeable Law hath been
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:61974:158"/>
our Rule, and of this we need not be ashamed, but in Gods power and Authoritie can we hold up our heads, when others do bow down their backs alwayes (crouching under every power and change of Government) as <hi>Davids</hi> enemies did, <hi>Psal.</hi> 69.23. for that is their place &amp; condition, as the Apostle doth witness, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.10</p>
                  <p>Again <hi>Jo. Tombs</hi> saith, that <hi>Paul</hi> a Saint was subject to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Cesar</hi> and appealed to him; then he acknowledged him supream, <hi>&amp;c, ergo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ. Paul</hi> was a Prisoner for the word of God and testimony of Jesus, and appealed to <hi>Cesar</hi> for justice, because he was unjust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accused, and had not done any thing worthy of bonds or of death; therefore according to their Law he ought to be set free; but <hi>Paul</hi> did not call <hi>Cesar</hi> the supream head of the Church, and chief Ruler in Ecclesiastical things; for if <hi>Cesar</hi> had been the supream head of the Church of which <hi>Paul</hi> was a member, he would have needed but little appealing unto for setting of him at liberty; but in such Arguments as <hi>Tombs</hi> hath used, is manifest the ignorance of foolish men, wherein their folly appears to all men, as the Scripture saith, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.9.</p>
                  <p>And whereas thou sayest that there is holy and harmlesse Christians, and many upright soules whose Consciences are very tender, and many godly persons that have excepted against that Oath, and the lawfulness of taking of it, as fearing it may take away the liberty of their Consciences, which is dearer to them then their lives?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> These that are so, are in a better condition then thy self, and to such thy ministery if received, would beget them from their holy and harmlesse state, into trangression of Christs command, and from the tendernesse of Conscience into hardnesse of heart; and now to answer their objections thou tells them that it was imposed for excluding of the Popes jurisdiction, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if so, why doft thou preach it up to be imposed upon the holy, harmlesse, godly Christians, who are redeemed from the Popes power and jurisdiction, and is come into the doctrine of Christ and into the life of Christ, which is out of all such Oaths.</p>
                  <p>Thou art a miserable Comforter to tender Consciences; but thy end is seen, &amp; therefore thou canst not deceive many; but for those that thou hast before mentioned, who are holy, harmless upright,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:61974:158"/>
and godly, which are tender of an Oath; they ought to be thy Teachers, who thy self art far from righteousness or tenderness of Conscience; therefore for thee it is a shame to be an imposer of Oaths upon tender Consciences, who professest thy self a Minister of Christ, who did forbid all swearing; and his Ministers did preach against it, and said, <hi>Above all things swear not at all, lest they fall into condemnatien,</hi> and not into the obedience to Christ's command; therefore they that fear God, will turn away from such. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5.</p>
                  <p>Now saith <hi>John Tombs,</hi> the grand objection against swearing is our Saviour words, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.34, 35, 36, 37. and <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.12. which words (saith he) doth seem expresly and fully to forbid any swearing at all, excluding some sorts of Oaths by name, and the rest by general terms, that our communication should be yea, yea, nay, nay, and what is more, cometh of evil, or of the evil one; yet saith he, We must of necessity find out a limitation of the speeches, as we do; and the limitation is this, that is, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, vain, light, prophane, unnecessary, customary, passionate swearing, or in secular matters of no importance, in these Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are forbidden.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> Indeed it doth plainly app<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ar that thou must of necessity either disprove Chris<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>'s words, or else deny thy own, seeing they are contrary the one to the other; so therefore thou saist that it was those oaths abovementioned that was forbidden by Christ and the Apostles. And I shall shew it plainly that thou hast no necessity to limit Christs words to vain and prophane swearing, (but only that thou wouldst have thy words true, and his false) for Christs words in <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. doth not intend such Oaths; for he speaks of the true Oaths which was used among the Jews, and such Oaths as Christ told them they were to perform; for it was not said in old time, that they should perform vain, light, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, unnecessary, customary and passionate oaths, but such as they were to perform betwixt the Lord and them, &amp; the solemn vows &amp; covenants which they made in old time to their Kings, and one unto another, the Christians now by the command of Christ was not to swear these Oaths, neither any Oath true nor false; so that Christ is not to be limited to intend vain Oaths; when as for instance, Christ mentions the Jews swearing, who was in the Commandment, who did deny all vain, customary, false, and passionate swearing; so that <hi>Jo. Tomb's</hi> limitation is
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:61974:159"/>
taken away, and Christs meaning must be as large as his words, which is not to swear at all by any Oath, but to keep to yea and nay in all promises, professions and engagements upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and so to keep out of the condemnation, whereby all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples consciences may be kept clean to the Lord in all things, and they brought to the exercise of a good Conscience; for the Lord is now teaching his people himself, and bringing them to obey the doctrine of his Son, in which they may find peace for their souls, and not to be in bondage unto such Teachers as are given to change with every Government, who preach as the false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets did, for handfuls of barley, and pieces of bread, &amp; such are they who preach the lawfulness of swearing (or sinning) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Christs command; but the Lord hath made them manifest, and is redeeming his Elect and Chosen from amongst such who have made a prey upon people, and fed upon their sins, but not upon the life which the Saints was in.</p>

            <p>WHatsoever is written or acted against the Truth, and those that walk in it, is but a fulfilling of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Truth, which saith, <hi>The way of the wicked is darkness, and they know not at what they stumble,</hi> Prov. 4.19. although the stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling-stone be the Light, the Foundation of many generations, in rejection of which many go about to build, and would be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved; one of which I shall here mention.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John Gaskin,</hi> who would defend and vindicate the Priests, their Preaching, Practice and Maintenance, though contrary unto Christ, his Apostles, his Light, and his Words declared in Scripture, as will appear.</p>
            <p>And first, That his Testimony may be received, he begins in an appearance of feigned humility, and begging of Pardon for his sl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ps and impertinencies, and rudeness of stile used against the Quakers, saying, <hi>his work is not with Eloquence nor Humane Arts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the examination of which, we do find that he hath often slipped, and used much impertinency of speech, and rudeness of stile, and neither Eloquence, Spirituality, or true Humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in his Works; many of which being so plainly seen to all, is accounted not worth printing again: But something here is mentioned, by which all the other may be compared and judged.</p>
            <p>Again, divers Reasons are alledged as a cause of printing <hi>J.G.</hi> his defence of the Priests: First he saith, <hi>The great malice and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy against the Ministers, and the many Letters and printed Books sent by</hi> Quakers, <hi>and the great growth and encrease in Errors; and because many of his old Friends and Acquaintance are</hi> (as he saith) <hi>seduced from the Church; and to strengthen such as are wavering through igne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:61974:160"/>
and weakness, and to clear himself, &amp;c. and that it might be seen, and come into many hands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> He that would accomplish those things before-named, to wit, subdue malice, envy and error, and instruct the ignorant and him that is out of the way, and strengthen the weak, he must be such a one as is led by the Spirit, and walks in the Light of Christ, which is so much hated and contemned by Priests &amp; their defenders, that first those things may be subdued in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and then minister against them in others; but none of those things can be done by that spirit which hath ruled in <hi>J.G.</hi> but that his latter reasons which he saith moved him to print, may be fulfilled, that is, <hi>that it may be seen, and come into many hands,</hi> &amp; that to thy own shame, when they read and consider thy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned Logick, wherein thou goest to prove, that it is not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to bring us to Heaven, to be freed from sin; for thou saist, <hi>a Horse hath no sin</hi>; and so by thy comparison, a man without sin is but as a Horse; so that thou hast truly said, <hi>thy work is without Eloquence or Humane Art</hi>: But seeing thou hast taken in hand to put things to publike view, in thy next prove who those men are upon the Earth that are without sin, and are not sufficient for the Kingdom of Heaven; and whether was it any thing that did separate man from God, but sin? And was not <hi>Christ</hi> only <hi>made manifest to take away sin?</hi> And is not man perfectly righteous when his sin is t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ken away, &amp; made the righteousness of God in him, which takes it away, to wit, the Lamb of God, which all the Nations of them that are saved, must walk in his Light? and it is those that hate the <hi>Light,</hi> &amp; i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> against freedom from sin, that have no understanding of the <hi>mysteries</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which is like the <hi>horse</hi> or <hi>mule,</hi> whose mouth must be held with bit &amp; bridle, and are like the beast that perish; but they that are freed from sin, are not so, neither is the <hi>horse</hi> their comparison; but herein thou hast sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med thy self &amp; thy <hi>Ministers,</hi> that they should be so ignorant, as neither to teach thee better doctrine before thou didst <hi>write,</hi> nor correct thee when thou hadst <hi>written</hi>; but to suffer such a thing to appear in this <hi>Nation</hi> where Light is broken forth, that the state of freedom from sin is no better then the state of a <hi>horse</hi>; but as the Scripture saith, <hi>Your folly shall be made manifest unto all men</hi>; Which Scripture is daily fulfilling, and we are satisfied in it.</p>
            <p>Again, to vindicate the Priests of <hi>England</hi> to be Ministers of the gospel, thou bringst many <hi>Scriptures,</hi> whereby thou wouldst prove
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:61974:160"/>
them to be lawfully called, though they be out of the power of God, and want the power of that which they teach, p. 7.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As the sons of Eli</hi> (thou saist) <hi>were lawful Priests, though they were wicked men</hi>; and this is a fit comparison, as thou may read in the first of <hi>Samuel</hi> 2.12. Now the sons of <hi>Eli</hi> were sons of <hi>Belial,</hi> they knew not the Lord; and so according to this thou hast rightly compared the Priests; for though they have the name of being called, yet know they the <hi>Lord</hi> no more then the <hi>sons of Belial,</hi> did.</p>
            <p>Again in the same page thou saist, <hi>The Scribes and Pharisees were called to teach, and</hi> Judas <hi>was a true Apostle</hi>; from which thou wouldst prove the <hi>call</hi> of the <hi>Priests</hi> to be a true <hi>call</hi> to the <hi>ministry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> If the Priests did minister as truly as the Scribes and Pharisees did, that is, read or speak the Scriptures truly; then thou mightest exhort the people to do as the Priests say, but not to do as they do; but seeing that they do not truly speak the Scripture, but by consequences pervert it, as thou hast done in thy book, it is not therefore a good doctrine to bid the people either do as they say, or as they do, because they both say falsly and do falsly. And as for thy comparing of them to <hi>Judas,</hi> as for his being called, and receiving part of the Ministry; that they are not like unto him in, because as yet they have no part nor lot in that matter; but for his treachery and covetousness, bearing the bag, and betraying the Lord of Life for pieces of money, in that they may be compared to him.</p>
            <p>But thou saist, The wickedness of the person doth not disan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nul his Office, being lawfully called thereunto; until he be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded from that Office: And to prove it, thou bringst several Scriptures, as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34.3. where the Shepherds eat the fat, and cloath with the wool, and did not feed the Flock, <hi>Isa</hi> 56.10, 11. <hi>They are dumb dogs, that cannot bark, sleeping, lying down, loving to slumber, they all look to their own way, every one for his gain from his Quarter; Come ye, say they, I w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll fetch Wine, and we will fill our selves with strong drink, and to morrow shall be as this day, and much more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant.</hi> And these saist thou, were truly called. From which example your <hi>Ministers,</hi> as thou thus provest, are lawfully called to the work of the <hi>Ministry</hi>; but when these <hi>Ministers</hi> and people read thy book, they wil not much commend thee for such a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence for them; but how dost thou prove that those before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned were <hi>lawfully called</hi> unto the <hi>work of the Ministry,</hi> being <hi>wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked persons</hi>? but when thou read'st the Scripture over again, thou
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:61974:161"/>
maist see that those are such as the Lord said did run, &amp; he sent them not; and said the Lord saith, when he had not spoken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 14.14. Now in this Vindication thou hast not done any thing of that pretended confuting <hi>E.B.</hi> his Book, called, <hi>A jusl and lawful Tryal of the Ministers and Teachers of this age</hi>; but hast rather confirmed it; for he truly compared them unto those spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of before-mentioned; and thou hast compared them as to the sons of <hi>Eli,</hi> which were sons of <hi>Belial,</hi> &amp; knew not God; and so his Book yet stands in force (for a tryal to such) unanswered.</p>
            <p>And again, as for thy pleading for tythes for such as are like the sons of <hi>Belial,</hi> thou hast no precept, practice nor example in Scripture to plead for such a thing, neither as such, nor as the Ministers of Christ. And whereas thou mention'st <hi>Acts</hi> 4. and <hi>Acts</hi> 5. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.4.5, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These Scriptures speak nothing of tythes, nor of any Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance to the Ministry, but only how that when they had plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a Vinyard, they might eat of the fruit; and when they had gathered a Flock, might eat of the Milk; &amp; when they had sown spiritual things (amongst a people) they had power to eat, and power to drink; and so it was ordained that they who preached the Gospel, should live of the Gospel; but it was not ordained that those who preached the Gospel, should live by <hi>forced mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,</hi> or by making <hi>merchandize</hi> of mens <hi>Goods</hi> &amp; <hi>Estates</hi>; of which the <hi>Priests</hi> in <hi>England</hi> for which thou writest this <hi>defence,</hi> are guilty.</p>
            <p>Again, thou goest about to defend the Priests sprinkling of Infants, saying, It is a sign or seal of salvation, page 64.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> If this be true, that all children thus sprinkled with water, have the seal of salvation by the resurrection of Jesus Christ, and are by this baptism made partakers of Grace, and united into the Church as Members of the Church, why do you say both Priests &amp; Professors, that there is no falling f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>om grace? Have not many been so engrafted into the Church, &amp; received that seal, whom you now call Hereticks and Deceivers? Why do you so confound one principle with another? For we have been already so engrafted into the visible Church, and made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of that Grace which you say it's impossible to fall from.</p>
            <p>And thou bring'st <hi>Calvins</hi> words, which saith, <hi>That although there be but a little water cast upon our heads, yet notwithstanding it is not a vain figure; for the Heavens are opened upon us, and God speaks in
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:61974:161"/>
it, as it were from Heaven, and Christ is there present with his blood, as Witnesses of the usage and operation of the Sacrament</hi>; and saith, <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism is a token and proof of our cleansing, or a seal and character where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God confirmeth unto us that all our sins are cancelled and abolished, and that they may never be rehearsed nor imputed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So then by this, he that hath a little water cast on his head, he hears God speak in it, &amp; Christ being present with his blood, washes away all sin, and this is a proof of his cleansing. So why dost thou and the Priests speak and write against us as being fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len from Grace, and departed from the Truth, seeing we have received as wel as you, the seal of the Covenant, and proof of cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l from it; if your doctrine be true? But as for sprinkling Infants, thou hast not brought one Scripture to prove it; but saist, <hi>Baxter</hi> against <hi>Tombs</hi> hath proved it; and quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> as if their words were plainer proof for thy purpose than any Scripture; for there is no Scripture (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out invented consequences) that is a precept for it; and when thou hast wearied thy self, &amp; canst not prove it, thou saist, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever may be proved from the Scripture by consequence, to be the scope and meaning of the Scripture, is sufficient proof, p. 73.</p>
            <p>Again, thou askest us a question, <hi>To shew thee one command or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in the Scripture for the baptizing of those that are grown up<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whose Parents one or both were Christians by professing the Gospel of Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> If thou knew the Scriptures, or didst weigh thy own words, it would stop thee from asking such foolish and unlearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Questions; for thou self thy confessest, that those which were grown up, were baptized, and that they had also received the holy Ghost before they were baptized; and as for them or their Parents being called Christians by their profession, many belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers were baptized and followed Christ, before the Name <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi> was given to them, as thou maist read <hi>Acts</hi> 11.26. that after much people was gathered, and so became Churches, they were first called <hi>Christians</hi> at <hi>Antioch</hi>; so whatsoever their Parents were called by profession, that is nothing to that which thou art a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to prove, (sprinkling of Infants.) But to conclude thy proof for Infants Baptism, thou quotest <hi>Rob. Brook,</hi> who (thou saist) hath read more Ecclesiastical Histories to find out the rise and beginning of the baptism of Infants in the Church of <hi>Christ,</hi> then all the <hi>Quakers</hi>; and yet he could never find the beginning of it. So here all this while thou hast pleaded for that which
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:61974:162"/>
thou knowest not who was the first Author of; and so thou hast run out thy self into meer ignorance; but that thou maist be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed and made wiser then thy Teachers, and thy learned Readers of Ecclesiastical Histories, I shall shew thee the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of that Baptism, and who first invented holy Water: In the reign of Pope <hi>Alexander,</hi> was holy Water first invented, Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter mixed with Salt; and by the saying of these words, <hi>We bless water mixed with Salt among the People, that all men sprinkled there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with may be sanctified and purified; and this we command all Priests to do,</hi> as <hi>Pliny</hi> writeth.</p>
            <p>And herby thou mayest know the first Father or Inventer of this your practice, the Pope, and not the Apostles; so when thou writes again, do not so undervalue all the <hi>Quakers,</hi> as thou hast done in this thy Book, as to say that they dare not read <hi>Latine</hi> Books, nor have read Histories; and thou saist we count it a sin for Ministers to learn <hi>Latine</hi>; but these are but false aspersions; for we do not account it sin to learn <hi>Latine, Greek</hi> or <hi>Hebrew</hi>; neither are we afraid to read them; but we do so far read and know them, that we have found out the Priests deceit, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending that of the Tongues which they had not; and though you preach and practice that which you know not where it had its beginning, yet vve knovv hovv deceit came in, and how it hath overspread you with darkness and ignorance; and because you see not, therefore you judge us to be blind; but the Light of knowledge is arisen, in which we see before the Pope his holy Water mingled with Salt, or sprinkling Infants was; and see the beginning and end of those dark inventions; and our Doctrine and Principles tend to the bringing of people to know a true living Foundation for all their practices; and that the darkness of Popery and traditions of men may not always keep people in blindness, to practice the Popes inventions instead of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles and Christ's Doctrine, who by the bright shining of his Light is leading people to his <hi>baptism,</hi> which is <hi>by one spirit into one body, by fire and by the holy Ghost</hi>; &amp; such can no longer be kept in that which doth not so much as wash away the filth of the flesh; but comes to the <hi>answer of a good conscience,</hi> &amp; witnesseth the <hi>bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism</hi> which saveth, as the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> saith, 1 Pet. 3.21. &amp; such are come to the <hi>washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, to fill up thy <hi>book,</hi> thou hast <hi>charged many false things upon us,</hi> &amp; so findst thy self work, by <hi>enlarging thy lyes one after another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="259" facs="tcp:61974:162"/>As first thou sayest some of us have affirmed that Christ did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver arise from the grave, and that his body is rotted within the grave, and that some of us have made a mock of his Doctrine of Justification, by the imputation and the intercession of Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> These things are thy own, and were never affirmed by any of us; but on the contrary, that Christ is arisen from the dead, and is become our first fruits, and by the imputation and intercession are we justified, and of God is he made unto us Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and life.</p>
            <p>Again thou sayst, we neither know nor understand what your Ministers preach.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Yes, we both know and understand that they preach lyes in the name of the Lord, and we know and understand that thou art going about to make a defence and vindication for them in so doing.</p>
            <p>Again thou sayst the Quakers say, it matters not whether a man do any good works, seeing they make him not good, pag. 41.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> This is false, for none of the Quakers ever said so; for our goodness is of the Lord, and not of works; and because we have received goodness and mercy from him, therefore do we those things that please him, and are obedient to his will and commands.</p>
            <p>Again, pag. 43. that we say a man is saved by hearkning to the light within him and obeying the same.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> We never said that by hearkning or obeying, that man is saved; but by him which they are to hear and obey are they saved; and without hearkning to his voyce, and obeying of him to whom he is preached, there is no salvation.</p>
            <p>Again, pag. 47. Thou sayest the Quakers in stead of blessing and praying for their Enemies, curse them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This is false, for we bless, and curse not; but all cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed practises, words and actions we testifie against, and for this cause are we accounted thy enemies, because we tell thee the truth.</p>
            <p>Again, pag. 48. Thou sayst instead of abhorring our selves, we justifie our selves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This is of the number of the rest, a false accusation; for self is that which we bear witness against in all, justifying nothing

but what God justifieth, and cond<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>mning nothing but what God condemneth.</p>
            <p>Again pag. 49. Thou saist the Quakers are so proud to think and say they are more perfect then the Apostle <hi>Paul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> When did any of the Quakers say, they were more perfect then the Apostle? but it seems thy tongue is at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to make a refuge for the Priests, and fill a volume of paper with lyes.</p>
            <p>Again pag. 51. thou saist, that many of the Quakers go up and down naked to manifest that they are as perfect as <hi>Adam</hi> was in Innocency.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Their going naked is as a sign unto thee and the Priests, whom the Lord is stripping of the sheeps cloat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing, that all may see your shame and nakedness, and that which you have been co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with is but as leaves, and a formal National profession of God, without his life, power, or spirit, and you must be as naked from this covering, before you be innocent, as ever any Quaker hath been from their cloathes.</p>
            <p>Again pag. 56, 57. thou saist that we do condemn not onely the Churches now in being, but all that ever have been; the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of <hi>Asia, Corinth, Galatia,</hi> and <hi>Thessalonica, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> This is but an addition to thy former lyes, for those Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches we do own, and all such as do walk in their life, and are gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by their spirit; for the Church of the <hi>Thessalonians</hi> was in God, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1. but thou hast appeared to be of another spirit, and hast manifested thy self to be a condemner of those Churches, as well as of us, as in page 55. thou saist in the Church at <hi>Corinth</hi> that there was such corrupt members among them, as you can scarce find in the worst of your Congregations.</p>
            <p>So of that which thou falsly chargest us, thou art truly guilty thy self, and so hast condemned those Churches, and justified your selves: But what corruption was it that was so bad in those Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, that is not in the worst of your Congregations?</p>
            <p>Again, as a proof for thy condemning your own Churches, thou brings <hi>Brightmans</hi> words, saying, <hi>Behold whatsoever is first, that is true; and whatsoever is later, that is false,</hi> ch. 3. p. 113. So that hereby, by thy old Author and Logick, thou hast proved all your Churches in <hi>England</hi> to be false; for the Churches of <hi>Asia, Corinth, Galatia,</hi> and <hi>Thessalonica,</hi> these were the first; but the
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:61974:163"/>
Churches in <hi>England,</hi> Episcopal and Presbytery, these are later, therefore false.</p>
            <p>Again pag. 60. Thou saist, the Quakers say they are so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect that they cannot grow in knowledge nor grace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The Quaker<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> never said so, but on the contrary, we do grow in knowledge and in grace, whereby we see, and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, how thou and the Priests do grow in rage, enmity, and false accusations against us; and we know also, that you must fulfil your measure of iniquity, and that all manner of evil must be spoken against us falsly, and so we are satisfied, because we suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer not for evil doing, but for well doing.</p>
            <p>Again, p. 61. Thou chargest us not to obey the commands of Christ, but dost teach men to break his commands, twice in one page, and again in the next page.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> All which doth but prove and manifest thy unbridled tongue, under which is the poyson of Asps; but if thou, or any other could in meekness or simplicity prove that we have eith<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r broken any of his commands, or taught others to break them; then we would be convinced, and thou shouldst be counted a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prover and Instructer in righteousness; but on the contrary, we see that bitterness and a lying spirit hath possessed thee, and that thou onely invents and imagines false things to fill up thy book, which we were never guilty of, which never any sober man, that had but the parts of a man, would never lay to our charge, seeing that both our principles and practices witnesseth to the contrary.</p>
            <p>Again, to make thy Volume large, in p. 82. thou bringst the same lyes over again, charging us to say, That we are more fuller of the Spirit then the Apostles, and of more knowledge, and stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in faith then the Apostles.</p>
            <p>Which affirmation is thy own, and not ours; and therefore is returned back to be condemned where it did arise.</p>
            <p>In <hi>p.</hi> 83. thou saist, the Quakers will have no Order; and <hi>p.</hi> 84. thou saist, We are wise in our own conceit, and that we think our selves wiser then Christ or his Apostles, or Churches.</p>
            <p>All which is but multiplying lyes, and so not worth much speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto, but onely that people may see, how thou hast run out thy self till thou hast no order over thy tongue nor over thy pen, which hast been so long time, as above <hi>half a year,</hi> in adding <hi>lye</hi> unto
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:61974:164"/>
               <hi>lye,</hi> to make a defence for the Priests; and so it appears that Truth will not defend them; and thy defence of lyes will not long defend them; for God will sweep away the refuge of lyes; and he that loveth and telleth a lye (as thou hast done) hath no part in the Kingdom of God.</p>
            <p>In pag. 94. thou accusest <hi>Sarah Blackborow</hi> as concerning a woman speaking in the Church, as if she had said that the flesh was the woman; from which thou concludest, that then the flesh must be married to Christ, and so wouldst make up absurdities from thy own words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This is thy ordinary way of proving Errour; first to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm a lye of thy own making, charging it upon another, and then draw a conclusion, answering this lye: but <hi>Sarah Blackborow</hi> nor any other of the Quakers have ever said that the flesh was the woman: but that which <hi>Sarah Blackborow</hi> said, was, that the flesh was to be silent; and that which spoke in thee was that which was silly, and was ever learning; but when any doth pray or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie, whether man or woman, and speak forth that which God hath made manifest; that is the spirit of the Father in both, and is not to be quenched; for there is neither male nor female, but all is one in Christ and in the Spirit, from which preaching and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesying proceeds; and the promise is that daughters as well as sons shall prophesie: and in the Church at <hi>Corinth</hi> they might all prophesie one by one, that all might hear, and all might be edified; but thou saist, those women that did prophesie, it was not in the Church; where then did they prophesie, if not in the Church? or what was the Church? for it is written, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1.1. <hi>that the Church is in God.</hi> And where must a woman be when she prays or prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, if not in the Church which is in God? And where was it that <hi>Philips</hi> four daughters prophesied, whether in the Church or out of it? and where was it that <hi>Priscilla</hi> did minister, whether in the Church or out of it? and <hi>Pheba</hi> a servant of the Church, whether she might not pray nor prophesie in it? and <hi>Priscilla,</hi> who was a helper of <hi>Paul</hi> in Christ, and laboured with him in the Gospel, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. might not pray or prophesie in the Church?</p>
            <p>But now to speak the truth in plainness to thee, that which thou cavell'st against, it is not the woman nor the man, simply considered, but it is the Spirit speaking in either, which thou canst not bear; for where the Spirit of the Father speaks in man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, thou setst thy self against it to oppose it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="263" facs="tcp:61974:164"/>And thou saist <hi>Susan Bond</hi> said, Christ was the husband, and of him they were to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Who could like it ill? was not that a good answer? And thou thy self must own Christ to be thy Teacher, and learn of him before ever God will make use of thee in his service or work, though the Priests may make use of thee for their defender.</p>
            <p>Again pag. 99. thou saist, we deny that any should either rule in the Church, or have any honour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> No, We do not deny the Head of the Church, which is Christ, to rule and to have all the honour; but we deny any Priest to bear rule by his means, or to receive the honour due unto Christ; for we see they are such as seek honour of one another, and not the honour which belongs to God onely.</p>
            <p>Now whereas-thou goes about to vindicate that wicked men may sing Psalms, and to prove it makes this argument, <hi>If any be merry, let him sing Psalms</hi>; now wicked men are merry as well as godly, though they have no true cause, <hi>Ergo, pag.</hi> 87</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> This <hi>Logick</hi> doth but prove thy own ignorance and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and not the thing intended by thee, as we shall shew; but first to answer thee with thy own contradiction; Dost thou not say in the next words before this argument, that the chief ground (or cause) is the moral duty lying upon all men by the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God? now if wicked men do sing Psalms by the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, do they do it without a true cause? Is not the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of God a true cause of any action to them which are commanded by him?

            <p>Again, in the same page thou saist, to hear, read, pray, sing Psalms and giving of thanks, they are works morally good being Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Lord: but the person doing them, being not justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they are not good to him: for whatsoever is not of Faith, is sin.</p>
            <p>Answ. This is another piece of confusion, and charging of God foolishly and fasly, to say that the Lord commands those things to be done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and those he commands to doe them, in doing of which it is not good to them but sin. Where hast thou learned? or where dost thou read of such a doctrine, that wicked men are commanded of God, to do such things, which in doing is not good to them but sin? Is God or Christ then the Minister of sin, or commands a man to commit sin? Is not this Blasphemy and Error in the highest degree? And how darest thou speak of God, or of his Commands, or of his obedience, seeing thou thus Blasphems him in his Worship? but this shall remain as a Testimony against thee; many other lyes and abominations hast thou spoken against us, and against God and his Truth; a few of which is sufficient to make thee manifest.</p>

enchanted? it may be thou meanest enchanting Ribbans; but if so, where didst thou ever know such a thing? &amp; for proofe, thou names <hi>Gilpin</hi> and <hi>Toldervyes</hi> books, which neither of them doth relate such a thing; so that it is thy enmity and wickednesse; for there was never any such thing among the Quakers, as giving Ribbans and drink after; but that charge thou mightst have laid upon the Priests and their Defenders, for there are the most ribbans used, and justified, till in pride they are become the Servants of the Devill, and there is the giving of drink one to another untill they be enflamed, and made unsensible of God and of his fear, by which they are enchanted, and bewitched, that they doe not obey the Gospell, but are given up to their own hearts Lusts, and thereby are become the Servants of sin and so free from righteousnesse.</p>
            <p>Lastly, not onely we have been falsly accused in these and many other things by thee; but even the spirit of God, which is the Fountain of cleanness, is by thee charged and accused to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, and defiled page 33. by passing through mans corrupt natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re (thou saidst) it becomes defiled.</p>
            <p>Answ. Is not this a sin against the holy Ghost which shall never be forgiven, to charge the spirit to be corrupt and defiled? And in this thou also chargest both the Father and the Son to be corrupt and defiled, for they are one; so that if one of them be corrupt, the other is corrupt also; and as the spirit is in the Saints, so is the Father in them, and the Son the hope of their glory, and none of them are defiled by mans corrupt nature. But there is that in man, by which that which corrupteth his nature is wrought out, so that man is made clean and undefiled by the spirit, and that spirit is not made corrupt and defiled by Man; for that is contrary to the Scriptu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

true) and falsely accused with all manner of evil, according to our Masters words, and these things we should bear in patience and silence, as to our selves, but as in respect unto others we are constrained, by the uncorrupted and undefiled Spirit of the Lords, to testifie to the world, that their deeds are evil, and to manifest the workings of Satan in the Mystery of Iniquity, which now already worketh in many, justifying the wicked, and condemning the just, which is abomination to the Lord, which his Spirit will not bear unreproved; and not only the just men are condemned and falsly accused, but also the just, undefiled, eternal and unerring Spirit is accused by him, who makes a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence for the Priests in their unrighteous practices and Wages; so by the plain evidence and demonstration of Truth, he being made manifest to be an Enemy to God, &amp; by his wicked Works and Words I do judge him not worthy of much more answer to his Book; &amp; also I do judge him not able to prove any of the false accusations charged in it against us, some of which is herein re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned unto him again; vvhich vvhen he doth but really weigh it, and consider, it may be he will sit down in silence, and wait, if there may be hope of his forgiveness for this (not only igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, but) wilfulness, charging us, the Spirit of God, and his people, vvith that of vvhich they vvere never guilty; for vve are in the Truth, unto vvhich every tongue shall confess, and by vvhich every Opposer shall become silent before the Lord; &amp; in the Spirit of this Truth do vve desire not the destruction, but the repentance and forgiveness of our Enemies: And those that do abuse us &amp; wrong us ignorantly, their sins vvil be sooner blotted out, than those who wilfully have set their hearts and tongues to vvork vvickedness; for they shall receive the <hi>greater condemnation.</hi>

            <head>
               <hi>R. H.</hi> His Answer to <hi>John Horn.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <hi>J. H.</hi> IN thy Answer to my Queries, thou seemest to be resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to say something, although it be absolutely contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the truth, and to that which thou knowest to be Truth, as will appear in what follows.</p>
            <p>In answer to my first, thou sayest, <hi>Christ in his Spirit ascended up to Heaven, when his Body was upon Earth</hi>: Is this an answer to the Question? Is the mind or Spirit called the Son of man, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>John</hi> 3.13. which came down from Heaven? And no man doth ascend up to Heaven, but the Son of man which was then in Heaven. So by this thy Answer it appears then, that the Spirit is the Son of man, and that there is no other Son of man that ascends into Heaven, but the Spirit; then what becomes of that body thou speaks of, if the Spirit only be that Son of man?</p>
            <p>In thy Answer to the second and third Queries, thou provest in thy way, <hi>that Mary did that which was forbidden by Christ, when she held him by the feet, and worshipped him</hi>; but in <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.9. there is no forbidding of her to touch him; but this is plainly manifest, that thou art in a snare, and cannot tel how to get out; and yet thou wilt be saying something, though thereby thou more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>snares thy self; but this Scripture thou wilt once know fulfilled, The Wicked shall be silent in darkness.</p>
            <p>When thou shouldst answer to the fourth, thou tellest of its being a secret, and of prying into things above what is vvrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; although the ground of my Query is grounded upon that vvhich is vvritten in <hi>Luke</hi> 24.4.</p>
            <p>To the fifth thou saist, That the Women did distinguish which was Christ, vvas certain; but hovv they did so, is a foolish, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Question: What certainty is there that they did knovv, vvhen thou knovvest not hovv? but this is like the rest of the Priests doctrine, beating the air, and leaving all people in uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:61974:170"/>
and yet would be paid for so doing; but the Lord hath made thee manifest with the rest, that you cannot deceive much longer.</p>
            <p>To the sixth thou sayest, <hi>the two Angels were seen visibly, but were not Bodies nor Persons of men</hi>; but in thy answer to the fourth, saist, <hi>that they both saw them as men and heard them speak, and had two individual Forms</hi>: Now if thou wert but simple, and not wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blind, thou mightest be the more excused.</p>
            <p>In thy answer to the seventh, thou art more lost and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed then in all the rest; for when thou shouldst answer who were the eleven Disciples that were met together, mentioned <hi>Luk</hi> 24.33. thou saist that <hi>Thomas might occasionally be gone out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> If he was gone out, then the eleven was not together, as <hi>Luke</hi> 24. Again thou saist, that <hi>Matthias was chosen before the Evangelist wrote his Book</hi>: What darkness and ignorance is this! Thou art not questioned when the Book was written, nor when <hi>Matthias</hi> was chosen, but who was the eleven that was together? and whether was <hi>Matthias</hi> one of the eleven, seeing he was not then chosen when Christ did arise from the dead? But there needs not much be said to thee, only to let thee see thy ovvn folly, lest thou should say thou art wise.</p>
            <p>To the eighth thou seemest to affirm, <hi>that the Scriptures are to be taken as they speak, and not otherwise a Mysterie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Then why dost thou and the Priests give meanings to the Scriptures, and do not let people take them as they speak, but makes them such a Mysterie without your meanings, and so plain with them? but this is thy practice and doctrine to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn thy self in the thing that thou allowest, and builds again that which thou hast destroyed, and so makes thy self a trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressor.</p>
            <p>Lastly, In thy conclusion thou falsly chargest me, <hi>That I do not believe that any of these things mentioned in these Scriptures, be really done.</hi> Which is not my Faith; for I do believe that those things mentioned, were really done and fulfilled, as the Scripture speaks; but it is no new thing vvith thee to accuse falsly, and to make lyes thy refuge; but vvhat in all those things thou hast done against me, I do forgive thee, and do vvarn thee for the time to come, that thou go not on to commit the unpardonable sin against God and his Spirit, never to be forgiven.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="275" facs="tcp:61974:170"/>Again in thy last paper thou declarest thy ignorance of the two Seeds, and askest, <hi>what be those two seeds?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> These two the Scripture speaks of, the seed of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and the seed of the Serpent.</p>
            <p>2 <hi>Who did or doth sow them seeds?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> God doth sow the one, and the wicked one the other.</p>
            <p>3 <hi>Where be they sown?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> In man.</p>
            <p>4 <hi>When be they sown?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> When man had a being, and a body to receive them.</p>
            <p>5 <hi>What be the bodies they shall rise with?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Their own bodies according to their own natures, the one pure, and the other defiled.</p>
            <p>6 <hi>Whether be these two seeds, and two bodies in all the world, or two seeds in every man, and the two bodies to or in every man?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> The seeds are but two in the whole world, having each seed its own body, and in every one, until the one be cast out.</p>
            <p>7 <hi>When shall those seeds arise, or be raised, whether after the bodily death, or after the spiritual death?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Every one in its own order, after the death of that which is born of the flesh, and also after the death of the spiritual wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness, which is yet alive in all hirelings and deceivers (such as thou art) where the seed of God is yet in its grave.</p>
            <p>8 <hi>What are the graves these are in, and out of which they shall arise?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These of which the Scripture speaks, which when thou comest to understand it, thou wilt understand both the seeds and graves of which we speak; Christ the seed made his grave in the wicked, and in the rich in his death, and out of that grave shall rise with his body into everlasting life; if thou canst receive it thou maist be satisfied.</p>
            <p>And as to the 9. Query, <hi>Why I say, that the one shall rise unto everlasting life, and the other unto condemnation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Because it is so, therefore I say so, and if thou say to the contrary make it manifest; but in this as in other things thy folly and ignorance is manifest, to ask why I speak the truth which thou thy self darest not deny to be truth.</p>

               <hi>A</hi> short Relation of the twelve changes of Government that hath been in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> within these 8 years, under all of which we have suffered Persecution.</head>
            <p>SInce by the Lord we were called, chosen, and separated to be his people, and had unto us committed the word of Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, and since his eternal power broke forth and was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest amongst us, hath he done great things in the Earth; for he hath prepared his way, and made it plain before the face of all people, by the appearance and testimony of his eternal light in their hearts: which hath not onely there shined, but is broken forth into a life of Righteousness in many whom the Lord hath accounted worthy to be his servants in his Work, to raise up a seed unto <hi>Jacob,</hi> and to gather the dispersed of <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> (both Jews and Gentiles) into the Covenant of Light and Life with the Father, from whence they are erred by transgression: and for the accomplishing of this work and service hath the Lord furnished us with spiritual Weapons to war even against spiritual wickedness in high places, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4.5. and against the Rulers of the darkness of this World, <hi>Eph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Yea many Heads or Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments hath been raised up and cast down again by one Hand and Power: and have all from the Lord (through his Servants) had a word of Wisdom and Counsel administred unto them, what they should do that they might be established: which if they did not, the Lord would break them to pieces: which word of the Lord was fulfilled upon them all. And every divers Head had a

Horn in it, to push at the Lambs of Christ withal, and at every appearance of his Spirit and Power in his people; but for his Elect sake was their days shortned, and his breakings and destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction came upon them according to his word spoken to them by his servants at divers times.</p>
            <p>And it is to be observed as the Lords doing and ordering by his mighty power, that within this eight years, si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ce we have been persecuted and cruelly used for the Name and Testimony of Jesus, and the Answer of a pure Conscience, there hath been twelve Changes of Government in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which have all of them more or less been guilty of our Sufferings, either in acting against us, or in suffering o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to act cruelly, and not endeavouring to restrain them, when they had power in their hands to do it, and the suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings laid before them, who suffered for righteousness sake; so that they could not plead ignorance, but was left with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out excuse, which now in the day of their misery and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation some of them do consider it when their time is no more.</p>
            <p n="1">I. As first in the time of the long Parliament, in the Year One thousand six hundred fifty two, although many pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, some prayed, and some fought for Liberty of Conscience in matters of Religion, yet at that time were we imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, beat, and persecuted, for obeying and worshipping our God in Spirit and Truth, according to his teaching; and at that time the Priests rage begun to burn like fire: and they run one unto another, and kindled the wrath in one another against the Truth, even to petition against the spreading of it (and those that walked in it) as a dangerous thing; and they gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally with one consent called the Truth Heresie, Delusion and Blasphemy: and those that ministred it abroad they called Ring-leaders of Sects, as in the Apostles days there was the like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>
            <p>But these was warned in their day, not to persecute the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, nor to uphold those that preached for filthy lucre, who served not the Lord Jesus Christ but their own Bellies, But they hearkned not to the Counsel of the Lord, but shut
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:61974:172"/>
their ears against his Instructions: therefore was their day taken from them, and their Power given to another, that they also might be tryed.</p>
            <p n="2">2 In the year (1653) a Council of State was called, by (<hi>O C.</hi>) but they did nothing to take off the weight of oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in the Nation, neither in Spiritual nor Civil things; for Pride and the deceitfulnesse of Riches entred into their hearts, that they did not regard nor set themselves wholly to do that which the Lord did require them although they were warned of God in their time, yet the Yoke of the oppressor was not taken away, but under it the Nation groaned and they wrought no deliverance in the earth.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Then the Little Parliament sat in the same year, and there was a plant of Righteousnesse (tending towards some e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and freedom) springing up in them, but the strength of deceipt and subtilty in others, did quench it before it brought forth any thing to perfection, and in that time the Priests fierce persecuting Zeal was so inflamed, that many Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions from several parts of the Nation was presented (against the Quakers) to the Parliament, and their continual clamor, Petitions and Addresses (and they being not regarded and hark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto) was one cause of the continuance of the Nations bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage and oppression, and God never prospered such as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them into their Councils, or gave heed to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, but a Curse and Destruction alwaies followed them in their undertakeings, whose ear was open unto such things. And in the time of his Power and Government, was persecution continued about Religion, though much was pretended to the contrary; they also were warned, and wisely counselled in their day, and so was left without excuse.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Again in the same year was (<hi>O C.</hi>) made Protector who had his day, and power in his hand to have done good; and to have done that which he and others pretended; but he joyning with the covetous Priests and their Interests; to make his arm strong, thereby betrayed the Lord and his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:61974:172"/>
into the hands of, sinners. And instead of removing Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, he caused new Acts to be made to Persecute by, and so brought a Curse upon himselfe and Family, and Tribulation upon those that trusted in him: And the Lord did often visit him with reproofs and instructions, untill he hardened his heart ag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>inst all reproof, and then was he given up of the Lord, and of his People, to his appointed end, as an Example to all Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites and Treacherous ones.</p>
            <p n="5">V. Again his second Parliament was called, and fat in the year 1654. In their daies was not the Land eased, not freed from its bondage, and when they had let in the Priests Spirits, and was incensed against the Truth, and intending to make Laws to Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute, then were they broken, and their power taken from them, who in their day was warned, but did not the thing which the Lord required of them.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. <hi>Oliver's</hi> 3d. Parliament, which consisted of two Houses, sat in the year 1657. they more than any of the rest, did draw back into that which they had declared against, and they let in the Priests Persecuting Spirit, and made Laws for Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and many were Imprisoned in the time of their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, because for Conscience sake they could not pay Tithes to the Hireling Priests, and because they could not Swear, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Christs command, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. And they had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny warnings and admonitions from the Lord, which they rejected, and so the Lord rejected them, as from doing his work.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. Then <hi>Richard Cromwell</hi> in the year 1658. was made Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector, whom the Priests flockt to as their Rock of defence, that he as their <hi>Joshua</hi> might lead them into their promised Land, which was but a Benefice of Tithes or Augmentation, their prayed for Inheritance, and they told him that the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel was bound up in him, and so did cleave unto him by Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, as they did unto all the rest before him for their own ends; but the suffering seed of God, which could not Flatter him; was not set free: who freely declared unto him the word
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:61974:173"/>
of the Lord, and instructions from the Almighty before his day was over.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. And again his Parliament sate in the year One thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand six hundred fifty nine, they continued and did not free the Sufferers, and imprisoned ones, who suffered onely for the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of their God, and for the exercise of a good Conscience; but they went on swiftly in the way of their destruction, to impose Worships upon people, and to decree unrighteous De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees: and upon that Rock of Religion they were broken as others had been before them, though they were exhorted to righteousness, and told of the evill that did come upon them.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. The ninth Government was again the Long-Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who came in with great pretences and resolutions, and protestations to make this Nation a Free-Common-wealth, not onely in Name but in Nature; And they begun well, and to call the prisoners up to <hi>London</hi> who suffered for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science sake, and freed some of them: and many of them intended to take away that great Oppression of Tithes, whereby much deceit, and many d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ceivers are held up in the Nation: and then the Priests rage was kindled against them, and they cursed them in their pulpits, and preached up War against them, and themselves get Horses, Pistols and Swords to fight for their Tithes and Maintenance: and when they were routed, then they again petitioned the Parliament, some begging pardon, and some pleading not-Guilty: and the Parliament was so blind, that upon their Dissimulation they let in the Priests again; and begun to gratifie the Priests, and establish Tithes, and then the wrath of God broke forth against them, and their Destruction was prophesied of, and told them that it should shortly come upon them, as it came to pass: because they would not receive the Lords Counsel in their day.</p>
            <p n="10">X. Then the Army and Committee of Safety (so called) had the Power and Government in their hands, which they
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:61974:173"/>
did not improve as they might have done for the liberty of the Subjects: neither did they receive that counsel from the Lord which would have opened their understandings how to have ruled for him, but with corrupt reasonings among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves perverted one another, and confounded their own work, reasoning out the good and honest intentions of some that was amongst them, until they all became as a heap of Confusion, and their work broken to pieces. A just reward of their own devices, and following the counsels of their own hearts; neglecting the Advice of that Spirit of righteousness which should have led and also established them in the work of the Lord in the Nation: so as unworthy and disobedient were they cast out.</p>
            <p n="11">XI. Then again the Long-Parliament had another day of Tryal given them into their hands; but a mad zeal and fury attended them, against the honest and upright-hearted people; and the Fury of the Oppressour was highly exalted amongst them, burning like fire, in which they could not contain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, nor possess their own Spirits in quietness; in which fury was folly: the effects of which did betray and destroy both them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and others. They being diverted from their first inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and desire after righteousness, a just recompence of reward for their disobedience came upon them, according to many true Testimonies from the Lords servants unto them; which if in time their ears had been open to the Lords instructions, and their hearts inclined to righteousness, that swift and sudden des<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

            <p>First, That you are not come in by your own Sword or Power, but by a remarkable hand of God in such a way as neither your selves, nor any other could have expected.</p>

            <head>An Epistle to Friends.</head>
            <p>OH my dear and truly beloved Friends, by the holy Spirit of my Father is my heart freely opened and enlarged unto you, even in the love which is as a Fountain of Life which plentifully flows forth in the virtue of the Father in the hearts of the beloved children of God, which many Waters cannot quench, amongst such who have known the Lord in the outgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of his Power, to be as the Morning to your souls; the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of whose Grace and Love hath been as a dew remaining upon your branches, and whose Doctrine hath even dropped as the rain upon your tender-Plants, that you thereby might be refreshed and nourished up unto eternal life; the Lord God hath honored you with his presence, and hath often fed you with his living appearances and manifestations, and you have known what it is to drink of the pure Waters of Life, even from that living Fountain which doth always flow in the Spirit, by which there is pure and spiritual refreshment ministred unto the soul; and the Waters of Strife have ye refused, which doth corrupt those that drink them; and so as it hath been, so let it always continue, that you may be kept clean by the Word which you have heard from the beginning, and by which you have been gathered out of the World by the Word of his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, and fed together as sheep of his pasture, and lambs of his Fold. So let not the feeling-sence of the loving-kindness of the Lord be forgotten, neither let the purity of your first love de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease; but let the dear love of the Father in the freeness of liffe, flow forth plentifully one towards another, which is the bond of perfection among the children of Light, by which you will come to be established in the free Spirit of the Lord, in the unity of Life, and in the fellowship of the Gospel, not being subject to change, or be moved from that Word and Spirit by which you have been taught and led in the vvay of Life, and by
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:61974:175"/>
which you have known the mind of Christ; and by his gift of Righteousness vvhich you have received, are you able to try every spirit (as you abide in it) whether it be of God, both as to Doctrines without, and as to motions vvithin. So therefore let nothing move you nor unsettle your minds from that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of Life which in all things is a perfect Instructor, which will keep you in a pure Dominion over all feignedness and forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, even to dwell in the substance, which is the holy life of the Son of God, where the true love, the heavenly voice, and pure joy is felt and known as in the beginning, always remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring how the Gospel in power came unto you, and how in fear and much trembling it was both preached unto you, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by you, with the many blessed effects of its operation, vvorking your conversation out of the earthly nature, &amp; from the earthly body, into the heavenly body, in which you are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to take up his Cross (if it be daily) to follow him in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation and newness of life, even from the true knowledge of him in whom ye have believed, and by whose povver you stand: For when we consider the infinite deepness and large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of that love with which we have been cloathed (and have even covered others withal) and likewise the many experiences of the Father's dealings with us, in working all our Works both in us, and for us, this cannot but deeply engage our hearts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, how that ever since we have known him to be our Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, he hath always gone before us, preparing our vvay, that we might serve him; he hath for his seeds sake even reproved Kings, and hath quenched the violence of fire that was kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in many hearts against us; he hath by his Wisdom put to silence the ignorance of foolish men, that he may clear us from all their reproach: He hath not only kept us alive in our suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the Wrath of our Enemies, but in the power of his spirit made us to reign over them; and not only over our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and open enemies, but also over the secret smitings of the wicked one, which would privily slay the righteous: He hath had a tender regard to his innocent ones, to keep them out of the snares of the betrayers, and to keep them in the unity of his power and love, in the which I speak unto you that know these things, whose ears the Lord hath so opened, that you can
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:61974:176"/>
try Words; and whose eyes also he hath unclosed, that you can see that which causeth divisions and offences, contrary to the Doctrine of Christ, and avoid it; for hitherto, even until this day, have you learned by good experience, and some through sufferings, that whatsoever hath risen up to oppose the Lord in his Way, to quench the strength of his Love, or to break the unity of his people, whether it hath been by spirit or letter, under never so innocent pretences, the Lord hath brought it down, and confounded it, and made it to be as dust under the feet of his Saints; so that we may together say, to the praise of our God, that we knovv the depths of Satan, and are not ignorant of his devices. Therefore in the sence of this experience, put on strenth, O ye Arm of the Lord, by vvhich he will do great things, and through whom he will make his power known to the Nations, in setting up his Kingdom and Government, and his Peace, of which there shall be no end; Let nothing hinder the setting up of his Scepter of Truth and Righteousness amongst you; and let the Life of Jesus in his Love and Power, reign over all the earthly spirits, and over the spirit of Jealousie, which is strong as death, and cruel as the grave; which being not received, it can hurt nothing but its own habitation in which it lodgeth. So keep your selves pure in the love of God, and be not partakers of other mens sins, walking worthy of the holy and blessed calling in which the Lord hath given you an inheritance among the living. And dwel in the spirit of meekness, in which the Wisdom and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God you will feel, to the refreshing of your souls; for as you therein abide, you are our joy in the Lord, and a strength unto us in his Work.</p>

            <head>Reasons why no Imposition ought to be upon mens Consciences by any but the Lord.</head>
            <p n="1">1. BEcause no man can perswade the conscience of another ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what God is, or how to worship him, but onely the Spirit which God hath given to instruct man.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Because to impose any thing upon another mans conscience either to do or practice, is not to do unto another as he would have another do unto him, and therefore is contrary to Christs doctrine.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Because all obedience or service that is thereby obtained, is for fear of wrath, and not from love, nor for conscience sake, and will but continue so long as that fear or force abides upon them.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Because thereby no man can make an Hypocrite a Believer; but it is possible that thereby he may make many Hypocrites.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Because that in all forced impositions upon mens conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces there is of the wrath of man exercised, which work<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="6">6 Because that men are not made thereby loving Subjects, but forced Slaves.</p>
            <p n="7">7 Because that by the force of imposing any thing upon men many are thereby hardned in their hearts, and resolved to resist, when as by love and leaving them free, they m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
