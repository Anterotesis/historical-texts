            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Actions</hi> to Posterity: And whilst the World lasts, this will be the most spatious and delightful. <hi>Theme,</hi> and will give the loftiest, and divinest Grace to <hi>Poetry;</hi> this made <hi>Homer</hi> sing, he that was <hi>blind,</hi> had ev'n that Inspiration; and BEAUTY from the Beginning has never faild to have more <hi>Adorers</hi> than the Gods: Nay it has still had such Power, that it has bin the Author of as strange <hi>Miracles;</hi> It has oft times made the Miser a Prodigal; the Old, Young; and the Coward, Valiant: what has it not done when joyn'd with VIRTUE? And what are You not able to inspire, in whom <hi>both</hi> excel; that Your Poet cou'd never be said to run on too lavish in Your <hi>Encomium?</hi> For Your <hi>Fame</hi> wou'd put a <hi>Blush</hi> upon all (as too mean) that can be said of You; and not accuse me of <hi>Flattery,</hi> if I cou'd describe You with as much Art as that rare Painter, who pictur'd his <hi>Venus</hi> with all the <hi>Smiles,</hi> and <hi>Graces</hi> of Woman-kind put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. How justly then have I heard the World ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire at the infinite <hi>Happiness</hi> of Your LORD—But (pardon me, <hi>Madam)</hi> this is a <hi>Stream</hi> wou'd glide me insensibly away, and if I do not check my self, I shall like inspir'd Prophets, say <hi>Wonders</hi> not to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd, in such a <hi>Style</hi> as our best Poets have fail'd in. Therefore as one that is more a <hi>Plain Dealer</hi> than a <hi>Courtier,</hi> I will leave my self severely to be censur'd by all that know You, for not revealing Your Ladiships <hi>Character</hi> as I ought, rather then put angry <hi>Blushes</hi> on your Cheeks by an unexpected Assault of so many rude Phrases: for <hi>Virtue</hi> so delicate, and tender as Yours, is sooner touch'd, and offended at the hearing of its just <hi>Praises,</hi> than at the <hi>Calumny</hi> of the Envious, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacters; and I protest to Your Ladiship, I had rather

owe my Bread to Charity, then be thought to earn it at so vile a Rate; only grant me leave to Sail a little into the Relation of the <hi>Iustness,</hi> and <hi>Gratitude</hi> of Your Ladiships Fortune. 'Tis known that You are descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the most <hi>Noble</hi> House of the <hi>NOELS,</hi> and joyn'd to that <hi>Incomparable,</hi> and <hi>Princely</hi> Family of the <hi>MANNORS;</hi> but let me say, by such a Miracle, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Day appear'd more beneficial to the benighted Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellour, then you o're its clouded Mansion, nor did the Rain-Bow (the Token of the Almighty in the Heavens, after the general Deluge by the Flood) to <hi>Noah</hi>'s poor remaining Progeny shew it self more welcome, and propitious, than Your Ladiship to the despairing and almost distracted <hi>Family</hi> of the RUTLANDS, which after an unfortunate <hi>Marriage,</hi> when it had long wander'd upon the Face of barren Waters, You were at last dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cov'rd as a blest, and fruitful Land to rest its weary <hi>Ark</hi> upon, and it may for ever hereafter call. You its <hi>Good Angel</hi> that in its Flight from Heav'n first pitch'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the lofty, and most graceful Seat of <hi>Belvoire,</hi> whose Antiquity (which I hope may ever last) will pay you more Respect, and Adoration as to its <hi>Preserver,</hi> than it has done to its <hi>Founder:</hi> For by Your means, and your Illustrious Offspring, <hi>England</hi> shall never want a <hi>Branch</hi> that shall spread it self from so Noble an <hi>Original</hi> as Your kind LORD, nor be the least of its <hi>Glories</hi> that it can boast thereof. How much is to be admir'd the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of the Divine Power which made so Excellent a Choice as Your Ladiship, of whom it shall be said, that <hi>Atlas</hi> has not supported the Heav'ns with more Fame then Your Ladiship the tottering Greatness of <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voire:</hi> And the History of Heroick Women shall hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth

own you to be the <hi>Greatest,</hi> and <hi>Noblest</hi> Pattern of 'em all—Pardon me, <hi>Madam,</hi> I begin to fall into a Relaps. I wou'd not give the VVorld an Occasion to suspect that what I have said is but the <hi>Prelude</hi> of a <hi>Request</hi> I intend to beg of your Ladiship, which is, that you wou'd vouchsafe to accept of this poor <hi>Poem,</hi> and be pleas'd to let me set your <hi>Name</hi> in the <hi>Front</hi> of it, as Princes put their Arms over the Dores of Places they wou'd have <hi>Reverenc</hi>'d, and <hi>Esteem'd.</hi> I will not then fear the <hi>Wise</hi> Criticks, nor the <hi>conceited</hi> Fops that are as curious in passing their <hi>Censures</hi> on a young Poet, as your stanch'd Beauties are to one that is newly cry'd up in the Town; yet I doubt not but what You please to condescend to own, they will allow of. I am the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther embolden'd to petition this of Your Ladiship, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause You are an Incourager of POETRY, and I have been inform'd that not long since in the Person of the famous Earl of <hi>Rutland</hi> it has met with the most <hi>conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable</hi> Patron that ever was; and all know that your gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Father, the present Vicount <hi>Cambden,</hi> is the best, and greatest <hi>Protector</hi> of VVit, and Learning in this Age. How can I fail then, in my Address to Your Ladiship, of either an <hi>Acknowledgment</hi> beyond my Desert, or at least a <hi>Pardon</hi> for my Faults, which I humbly implore you wou'd not deny, and is the greatest <hi>Favour</hi> that can be hop'd by, MADAM,</p>

               <l>If they shou'd chance to ask, why <hi>Helen</hi> lives?</l>
