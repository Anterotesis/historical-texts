            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Ere is a Pſalme fully made up of praiſe: and it being a day of praiſe, I frame my meditations onely to praiſe this day. It is not long ſince I knew of it, and then being asked by theſe godly young men for this Oration, I had no power to deny them. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, I conceive that it is matter of great prayſe to ſee ſo many yong ones to deſire a day of praiſe, and to ſet it apart to God alone. This mercy doth deſerve a day of prayſe. And beſides, I would not be willing to quench the leaſt ſparke that is kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64035:3"/>
in any one that is here. And beſides this, I do heare they are very well given, and that they doe much frequent the Faſts and our Humiliations, and doe not give themſelves to prophaneneſſe, as others. And theſe were the reaſons that I could not deny their requeſts, and the reaſons that made me chuſe this Text.</p>
            <p>Well then, this Pſalme is a ſong of praiſe. From hence learne this choice point:</p>
            <div n="1" type="doctrine">
               <head>
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> 1.</head>
               <p>That in the conſorts of all Creatures prayſing God, young men praiſing him doe make ſweet melody in his eares, and God taketh moſt delight in it.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="1" type="reason">
               <head>
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1.</head>
               <p>The firſt reaſon of this point is this: The pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the young ones are joyned to the joyes of heaven: for out of the mouthes of babes and ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings God hath ordained praiſe. See <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. 15. 16. that place is very remarkable. For firſt ſee there how the children cryed <hi>Hoſannah,</hi> when Chriſt came to whip out the buyers and ſellers out of the Temple. Marke, ſo it was with us. For wee had buyers and ſellers in our Temples, that bought and ſold mens conſciences at their will. They were earthly buyers, but they are whipped out: and now the children are crying <hi>Hoſannah;</hi> and I verily beleeve that this day was partly kept for the whipping out of thoſe our buyers. Many
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64035:3"/>
worthy Divines have obſerved that it was a great miracle that Chriſt did to whip out thoſe ſellers, ſeeing they knew him to be a poore man ſon, the ſonne of <hi>Ioſeph.</hi> But you may ſee there they were ſore diſpleaſed, even as our Scribes are at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="reason">
               <head>
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 2.</head>
               <p>The ſecond reaſon is this, God hath purchaſed their praiſe. When the young men ſhall praiſe God, what a ſhame will it be to our old men? but no marvell, for God hath purchaſed their praiſe. There was a young man that came to Chriſt, and he loved him: and that may encourage you to come to Chriſt. For I ſay, all you that are here this day with an upright heart, Chriſt doth come and looke on you, and love you dearly. Oh he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth your firſt fruits. And that you may ſee hee loveth your firſt fruits, ſee in the 7. of <hi>Micah,</hi> verſ. 1. that place doth allude to our purpoſe. God doth love the firſt fruits of young men, even as our Ladies doe love the firſt fruit of the earth, as Cherries, and ſuch like. God is much delighted in your firſt fruits. See <hi>Hoſea</hi> 9. 10. God doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in budding fruits. See for proofe in <hi>Levit.</hi> 2. 15. and in <hi>Deut.</hi> 26. 6, 7. and in <hi>Deut.</hi> 19. 14. and in <hi>Nehemiah</hi> 10. 35. and in <hi>Exod.</hi> 15. 13. and in <hi>Deut.</hi> 8. 4. and <hi>Levit.</hi> 2. 4. Theſe are the ſeverall places that may be ſeene, that God will have the firſt fruits. God will not have young men to ſtay
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64035:4"/>
and ſay they are not able to ſerve him: no he will be are with them and theire weakneſſes: you muſt come in: God will not have you ſtay, till you be full ripe: but will have you come in, in green care. But ſome may ſay what ſhould yong men goe to God yet for; let them ſtay till they haue more wit: but I ſay, God he doth call them, and not only that, but he ſtands much upon it, becauſe it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him well: and beſides, God doth not only call for our firſt fruits, but for the firſt of our firſt fruits, as in 23 of <hi>Exod.</hi> and 19. Some may ſay God ſhall have yong dayes, and I will ſerve him: but it ſhal be when I am out of my time or when I am free: but I ſay it muſt be whilſt thou art a pren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, whilſt thou art 78 or 10 years old: do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferte it: Againe as you muſt come to God in your young years; ſee then how you muſt come. You muſt come ſoberly, be ſure of that: as in the 13 of <hi>Exod.</hi> and ſoe in the 18 of <hi>Numb.</hi> and 26: and againe, there muſt be a day ſet apart to doe it in as in the laſt place you may ſee it plaine. It is not a thing to be ſlighted, but to be much regarded.</p>
               <p>You muſt ſet a time apart to meete the Lord: as this day you haue a great time and opportunitie: and when you goe home, goe to God and ſay as in the 26. of <hi>Deut.</hi> and 4. goe and tell God that you haue beene ſeeking his promiſes that he made to your forefathers and that you have found that they are fulfilled, and you have beene prayſing
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64035:4"/>
his name this day: and goe and tell God thou haſt a poore father and mother in the country that is in the Egyptian darkneſſe, and in blindneſſe, and bleſſe God that thou art otherwiſe this day: but let this be by thy ſelfe all alone: againe, when you doe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer up your firſt fruits, do it cheerfully, willingly and reverently.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="3" type="reason">
               <head>
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 3.</head>
               <p>The third reaſon is this, that when grace doth fully meet with a ſweet nature; when the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of grace doth meet with the ſweetneſſe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, then doth ariſe a deale of glory to God: for grace is moſt ſweet to a ſoule that is not full of bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe; truely there is a great deale of pitty to bee had of one that hath a ſweet nature and no grace added to it, but I have greater hopes of you.</p>

            <div n="4" type="reason">
               <head>
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 4.</head>
               <p>But for the fourth reaſon, and that is this, that the time of youth is the fitteſt and moſt choiſeſt time for to give God your hearts in; and to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, ſee <hi>Eccl.</hi> 12. 1. Chriſt doth come a wooing to you this day to come to him, becauſe it is the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt time for him, for now you are ſtrong and quick and full fed: remember thy Creator in the daies of thy youth.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="5" type="reason">
               <head>
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 5.</head>
               <p>There doth a great deale of honour riſe to God by the truth of grace in them: grace manifeſted fully: a cloth can never be ſo well died in the cloth
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64035:5"/>
as it is in the wooll, juſt ſoe with us. I remember a ſtory of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> who was a mightie enemy of Rome, and why was it but becauſe his father made him ſweare when he was nine yeares old that hee ſhould be her utter enemy, and he remembring that his young oath, made him to keep it ſo ſtrictly: So let us doe in this caſe in this our day, and ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme them all our daies.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="6" type="reason">
               <head>
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 6.</head>
               <p>But a ſixt reaſon, God doth ſee them very emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in their youth, it is like to be the better harveſt when the ſeed is ſowen betimes: there was never no notorious men for God in all the Scriptures, but thoſe that did begin betimes, as <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Daniel:</hi> an old man may come to heaven but not bee eminent for Gods glory as you young men may be: Iuſt like a young tree in the ſetting; a yong plant may meet with many rubs and many a ſhake, but if it bee not pulled up it will grow ſtill: So you young men may have the divell come and ſhake and trouble you, but not pull you up: If ſo, then thou maiſt come to be a flouriſhing tree.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="7" type="reason">
               <head>
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 7.</head>
               <p>But a ſeventh reaſon why God doth take delight in young men is this: that by the working of grace in you, it doth incourage old men: it may bee thou haſt a father or mother or maſter that is in blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, it may make them looke about them to ſee thee ſo gratious, it may make them ſay, Lord my
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64035:5"/>
ſon or daughter can diſcourſe of heaven and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that that I never knew in all my life, and I am thus old and am yet blind and in ignorance, and this may be another reaſon.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="8" type="reason">
               <head>
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 8.</head>
               <p>But another reaſon why God would have you come to him, becauſe thereby there will be a world of ſinne prevented: which if that we ſhould goe on in ſinning, we might juſtly bee called young boyes and children, and old and antient ſinners: but if we ſerve God while wee are young, then all drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe, and ſwearing, and Sabbath breaking, and lying, is all prevented: but if we goe on in ſinne then we may at length beare the reproach of our youth, as it was with <hi>Ephraim.</hi> A naturall aged mans bones is filled with ſinne, ſo that if you would come and aske an old man what he would have, I will warrant you he will cry out to be delivered from the ſinnes of his youth, of his prentiſhip: oh then a world to have them away!</p>

               <p>But an other reaſon, there will bee a great hope of a ſucceſſion of godly ones for after ages; God taketh delight, that you ſhould come in becauſe thereby there might bee a continuance of his name from one Generation to another: ſee in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72. 11. 17: The Lord doth love a land when he ſeeth a many Towers up: even as a gardner loyeth to ſee his garden furniſhed with dainty flowers: I am

               <p>But for another reaſon and that is this, that in a young mans comming to God, there is the great power of God ſeen in their ſelfedeniall, for there is a world of ſelfedeniall in it: if wee conſider how all manner of pleaſure doth invite them, and they to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it: it is a great kindneſſe they offer to God to deny all for him, ſee <hi>Ieremiah</hi> 2. 2. for any man to leave all to goe to God it is ſuch a thing as God will thanke thee for, and it is a great ſelfe deniall: ſo in the firſt Epiſtle of <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. 14. having ſhewed you the reaſons of the point why God taketh ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in young ones; now let me give you ſome incouragements to this worke at this time.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:64035:7"/>
Againe, let us praiſe God, becauſe God is going to make Jeruſalem a praiſe on the earth, and be ſure you yong men praiſe God, becauſe you may ſee it in your daies: you may ſee Chriſt raigne: nay you may bee great inſtruments of bringing the ſame glory, ſee <hi>Iſal.</hi> 8. 2. and there you may ſee that out of the mouthes of babes, God will ſtill the enemies and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venger: and wee by experience may ſo ſpeake this day: for our enemies mouthes are ſtopped this day, at this our day of praiſe.</p>
               <p>Againe, praiſe God that you are here this day, and not amongſt the Idols or Maſſe, to the which wee were very neere crept: wee were under hard taskmaſters, but now bleſſe God they are under us.</p>
               <p>But now for ſome directions to you all, and ſo to end.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt then be truly humbled for this your duty this day, and doe not reſt in it, as to thinke you did better then many a one did, not ſo I pray you, but be humble.</p>

3. Againe, be ſure you doe not neglect your calling. I would not have the men of the world to have that claw againſt you, but I would have you all ſo behave your ſelves after this day, as your Fathers, or Maſters ſhould ſay, you were mended in all your actions and words and behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our wonderfully, and that they ſhould ſay you have beene the better ſince you came amongſt theſe Puritans, and that they will never hinder you from going among them more: I would have them ſay that from this very day you have beene gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Againe, bee ſure thou art freed from the luſts of the fleſh, for that will bee ſtealing on thee do what thou canſt; it may be this very night if thou takeſt not heed.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Againe, doe all that you doe orderly, not tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuouſly, as I here in ſome meaſure you doe.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Looke in the firſt Epiſtle of <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 21. there <hi>Iohn</hi> bids you keepe from Idols: ſo doe I perſwade you all, for wee are inclining to that ſinne.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Laſtly, you young men that are here this day, have much ingaged your ſelves to God, and if any of you ſhould now turne away from God and walke ſtubbornly and ſcornfully, I tell you whoſoever you bee, the curſe of God will follow you; and if you ſee any that doe fall away, bee ſure you labour to get them in againe: but if there

bee any ſuch here as will not bee wrought upon by faire meanes, nor foule; I tell thee, it were better for thee that thou wert daſhed in peeces in this place, before ever thou doeſt goe out from hence, to ſcandalize this holy profeſſion, and way of godlineſſe.</p>
