            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I ſhall begin with that barbarous and inhumane act committed by the Cavalliers at Leiceſter, where after they had gotten entrance into the Towne, and falling on plundering and pillaging thereof and when there was no man oppoſed them they ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med as fierce as Lions, and ſwore damme me and ſinke me if we doe not kill all the Puritans and Round-heads in the towne. There was a good Religious honeſt wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man named <hi>Iane White,</hi> that hearing them ſo notoriouſly to ſweare and blaſpheame began to reprove them for it, offering no manner of reſiſtance unto them: whereupon one of this wicked rabble ſhot her with a brace of bullets thorough the back and bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, upon which ſhe immediatly dyed; ſhe being great with child<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

with hard and cruell uſage: And in Leiceſter-ſhire and Stafford-ſhire they
ſpoyled his Majeſties good ſubjects, and many were murthered and barbarouſly
uſed, raviſhing of women, and bloudily killing others, not ſparing thoſe that were
great with child, nor pittying poore little infants: nay ſuch was their inhumanity
that at the late Battell fought neere Kynton, when they ſaw they were not able to
revenge their malice upon the Parliaments Army: they left fighting with Souldiers
and fled about the Country, killing of men women and children that were altogether
unable to defend themſelves, killing any living creature that they met with; for
they ſlew the very Doggs and all, and as if the moſt cruell and mercileſſe of this
Nation could not invent cruelties anſwerable to their bloudy minds: they doe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine
into their Army a great number of the Iriſh Rebells, whereof are great
ſtore of Iriſh women, which pillage and rob in the Countries where they come
worſe than the Souldiers, and are more cruell and mercileſſe than they: and at
the Battell at Kynton did not onely get the beſt pillage of the dead Corpes at the
time when the battell was a fighting; but thoſe that they found wounded or may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
that they were not able to get off from the place (although otherwiſe might
have recovered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they moſt cruelly cut their throates with great Knives which
they carry for that purpoſe, or elſe knocked out their braines with their
Pole-axes.</p>
            <p>When the Cavalliers were at Shrewsbury they plundred moſt of the honeſt mens
houſes both in that Towne and Country adjacent, and tooke their Cattell, and
did drive them to their quarters, and what they could not eate they drove to ſome
other places and there ſold them, and when they had made a prey of all that they
could meete with about Shrewsbury, they played the like prankes at Bridg-north,
and other places thereabouts, and at their going away out of that Country, beſides
what hurt they did at Kittermaſter and Bewdly, which bought their freedome at a
very deare rate; they carried away with them all the Butter, Cheeſe, Bacon and
other proviſions they could find, which hath bred a great ſcarcity thereof.</p>
            <p>From thence they went to a Town called Burmegam in Warwickſhire, where
without any reſpect of perſons they fell to plunder the whole Town, and took all the
money, plate, and other things that were of any value that they could finde, and not

wealth of that Town, and ſpoiled their <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

               </gap>ble con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: and yet their wicked deſires to do miſchief not being ſatisfied<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they made an attempt to fire the whole Towne; but by reaſon that they were ſuddanely put to fight through feare of the Parliaments Forces which were marching after them, they
went away unſatisfied in that particular.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:40116:4"/>
In York when they had continued long in that City, and exceedingly impoveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
the inhabitants taking all the proviſion that was in the City, and drinking out
both beere and wine without giving any ſatisfaction for the ſame, at laſt they fel to
plundering and pillaging the City, and plundered a great part thereof, and impriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
thoſe that withſtood them, threatning to kill divers of the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eſt Miniſters. When they came to Banbury, although his Majeſtie himſelfe gave his hand and Seale to the Major that no injury nor violence ſhould be offered to that Town to any of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
yet ſuch was the barbarous carriage of the Cavalliers at that Town, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
charity or reſpect of the Kings honour, having engaged his word to the contrary,
they plunered the whole Towne, taking from thence not only money, plate, jewels,
and other things of good value which they found in their houſes, but took their Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell,
horſe, ſheepe, &amp;c. and carryed them away, and alſo tooke away the cloath and
other commodities that were in Tradeſ-mens ſhops, to the ruine and deſtruction of
the Inhabitants, ſaying that the King doth not know the condition and ſtate of War;
and likewſe have plundered the Lord <hi>Say</hi> his houſe there, leaving nothing but the
walls, drove away his Cattell, deſtroyed his Deere, and ſuch as they could not kill,
they plucked downe the pales to let them out: At Abington it was not ſufficient to
plunder the Towne, after they had gotten a great ſum of contribution money, and to
leave the Inhabitants in as naked a condition as they did thoſe at Banbury, but there
being an honeſt man of good repute, <hi>William Wright</hi> in the ſaid Towne, that before
the Cavalliers came thither, gave counſell and advice to the reſt of the Inhabitants to
ſtand up on their guard, and oppoſe them, and thereby to keepe the ſaid Towne from
violence and oppreſſion: And that the Ammunition that was in that Towne might
be ſecured out of their hands, that ſo it might not be employed againſt the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
By the ſpeciall command of Prince <hi>Robert</hi> this perſon was condemned by
martiall Law, and banged up at his own doore: ſuch is the bloody mind of Prince
<hi>Robert,</hi> that it would make any Chriſtian mans heart to ake, to think of it, for as he
was begot in the heate of a bloody war, ſo he lives and hopes to thrive by his bloody
practiſes: But the neerer their approach is towards London, the more ſad demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations
we ſhall finde concerning this ſubject. Then they began to burne houſes,
the pillaging of goods will not ſuffice, nor the like enormities which <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Two Gentlemen of good repute being travelling from London into the Countrey,
were taken in their way at Hounſloe at the ſigne of the Kathern-wheel by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valliers,
who had been forraging up and down the Countrey to ſee what booty and
pillage they could get, who violently broke into the chamber where they were, and
when they had taken them priſoners they haſted into the ſtable and ſeized on their
horſes and forced theſe Gentle-men to ride behind two of them to Eggham, and
there they found Prince <hi>Robert,</hi> who had made a Vow, never to vndreſſe nor ſhift
himſelfe till he had brought King <hi>Charles</hi> to white-hall; and being examined by him
it was laid to one of theſe Gentle-mens charge that his wife was a Round-head, and
if they had her there preſent, they did ſweare they would hang her, and it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged

againſt the other that he was a Preacher in a tub, but nothing being proved
they were carried to the Court of Guard, and a Captaine that was a French man
had the charge over them, who ſet them in ſuch a ſmoky chimney, that they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
quite choaked, yet they durſt not ſtir for a ſtrong guard was ſet over them
which threatned, and ſwore <hi>God damme them,</hi> they would piſtoll them.</p>
            <p>And that night Prince <hi>Robert</hi> being to march to Hounſloe, theſe Gentlemen (ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
out of their cruelty, or to make them merry then otherwiſe) were made their
conducts, and following them with piſtols, they ſwore that if they led them but a
yard out of the way they immediately would ſhoos them. And they were not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to eate or drinke one drop, though they offered to pay for it, and were ready to
ſtarve for cold &amp; hunger, but were purſued with reproachfull words, as lead on lead

and ſuch other Round-headed raſcalls we will piſtoll you, &amp;c. and were driven on
with many other priſoners, being coupled with cords two and two together,</p>
            <p>The 28. day of this month was apprehended a Gentleman clothed in very
good habit, and hanged in a with upon a Tree, for ſaying he was for the King
and Parliament, and for ſpeaking in honour of the Parliament; and no man
ſuffered to cutt him downe or cover his face untill he had been made a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
ſpectacle to the whole Army. At a towne called Iſtle-worth the Cavalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
tooke an other honeſt Religious man called good man <hi>Bray,</hi> who becauſe
he ſaid he was for the King and Parliament, they moſt inhumanly d<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d cart of his Eares and gave him beſides thirty woundes in his body, and not being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with this Butchery they threw him after wards on the Dunghill; with
this moſt unchriſtian ſcoffe, <hi>Let the doggs licke him whole.</hi> They tooke another
in the ſame towne who flying from their fury got into a houſe, and having bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
faſt the gate, his wife comming he was enforced to open it for her; and the
Cavalliers ruſhing violently in after her faſtned a coard upon his feet and drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
him about the ſtreetes, and being weary of their owne cruelty: they ſaid
why ſhould we weary our ſelves any longer with this Parliament dog; and ſo
diſcharged three piſtolls at him, and ſo eaſed him of his torments, and his life
together.</p>
            <p>When the Cavalliers came to Brainford about five thouſand of them, with
many peeces of Ord<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ance fell upon Collonell <hi>Hollis</hi> his Regiment, being all that were quartred at that towne, who fought very couragiouſly before they
would yeeld to their mercileſſe cruelty, inſomuch that the Cavalliers ſaid
that they were either Saints or D<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>vills: for if they could have done execution upon any thing <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

               </gap>able the great vollies of ſhotte they beſtowed upon they had quickly killed every man of them in the place, but after many houres
fight having taken many of them priſoners they put them in a pound and pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nioned
them together being ſtript to their ſhirts and without stockings or
ſhooes and the next day drove them like ſheep<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whipping them like dogs to
Hounſloe over furrs and buſhes, which was more torment than of death it
ſelfe. And ſome of Collonell Hollis his Souldiers fl<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> into the Thames for ſafety, where the Cavalliers ſhot at them till they were drowned, amongſt
which was one Captaine <hi>Lacy</hi> a ſtout and Valliant man, they tooke five of the
Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> his Souldiers priſoners, and tyed their hands and forced them
<pb facs="tcp:40116:5"/>
into the River, and a Trooper rod into the water after them and forced them
into the depth, where they were drowned.</p>
            <p>And when the fight began at Brainford they placed ten of the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi>
his Souldiers whom they had formerly taken priſoners at Kynton pinioned
in the front of their men at a breaſt-worke to receive the bullets that came
from Collonell <hi>Hollis</hi> his Regiment: but ſuch was the providence of God,
that none of them were hurt though ſhot through the cloathes in many places;
when they had poſſeſſed themſelves of the towne, firſt they dranke and waſted
the Beere and wine in the ſeverall Innes and other places, and that which they
could not drinke they let it out upon the ground.</p>
            <p>They likewiſe piſtolled to death one <hi>Francis</hi> who lived at Vxbridge, becauſe
he ſaid he was for the King and Parliament, juſt as he came out of his Inne ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
home to his wife and children.</p>
            <p>But one of the moſt inhumane actions that they did at Brainford was the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laging
of one Mr. <hi>Pierce</hi> a Brewer, who not only tooke away all his beere and
his cheife brewer, but ten or twelve ſtout horſes, and not being contented
therewith they came into his houſe, and drove his wife forth thereof into
the high way, ſhe being in her ſmock with her child in her armes, though ſhe
had laine in but a week, who ſuddenly dyed after it; and had like to have
fired his houſe; ſuch was their crueltie and inhumane actions at this poore
Towne.</p>
            <p>Alſo his next neighbour one Maſter <hi>Smith</hi> a ſervant to the King, being one
of his guard, and well knowne to ſome of them, had much a doe to preſerve
his houſe from pillaging, his life and his wives from piſtolling, and his houſe
from firing; for they ſhot divers times at it, but yet miſt it, thanks be given
to God; And at their flying away from thence they tooke from the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
their money, Linnen, wollen, bedding, wearing apparrell, horſes, cowes,
ſwine, henns, &amp;c. and all manner of victualls<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> alſo Pewter, braſſe; Iron-pots and
kettells, and all manner of grocery, chanlery, and appothecary ware, and
many of the feather beds which they could not beare away, they cut the tikes
into peeces and ſcattered the feathers in the fields and ſtreets. And to be ſhort,
they made ſpoile and hovocke of all things that were worth any thing in
the towne: ſparing neither rich not poore, but either ſpoiled or carried
with them, all things from the coſtlieſt jewells, apparrell and hangings of
many Gentlemen of great quallity, even to the poore almſ-women, and the poor
beggars, that begs at the townes end. And when they had uſed the towne in
this manner, they defaced the houſes and ſet one of fire, of purpoſe to have
burnt downe the ſaid towne, though afterwards it was happily quenched by
an inhabitant.</p>
            <p>Nay their inſolency and cruelty appeared yet greater for they ſet drawne
ſwords and Piſtolls cockt to men and womens breaſts; threatning them with
death, if they brought not out all their money, and that they would cut of
their noſes; and pluck out their eyes, calling them Parliament dogs, Round-headed
Rogues, beatting, laming, and wounding them, tying others with ropes
and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

               </gap> and being ſtript to the ſhirts, were carried away priſoners; and as

               </gap>tland being very thrifty, he ſtooped to take a litle water in his hat to drinke, they moſt cruelly beate him and bruiſed him, for
offering to doe it. When they came to Kingſton, they uſed the like violence to
that towne, as they did to Brainford, except to ſome few that were of the
Malignant party, and therein they ſhewed more humanity at this town<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

and one Mr. <hi>Thomas</hi> a Book-ſeller of Briſtoll, they tooke from the firſt all his
money and his ſword, from the other his watch, his mony, and his ſword, be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing
threatned with their lives, and looked every hour when they would kill
them, but they eſaped with their lives, th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Yet ſuch is the heatheniſh barbarouſneſſe of this accurſed generation, that I cannot

little Infants, &amp;c. but that the generation to come, might have every way cauſe
to curſe them, they endeavour to uſher into this Kingdome the miſerable calamity of
famine, for they now begin daily to burne houſes, fire Towns and Villages, deſtroy
the Corne, both in the field and in the barne, cut downe and deſtroy the woods,
and plants which the earth is bringing forth, drive away all manner of Cattell both
of Horſe, Oxen, Sheep, and other Cattell making no diſtinction of fat or leane bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren,
or thoſe that are great with young but drive them all away that they light on,
both out of Bucking-ſhire Bark-ſhire and a great part of Oxford-ſhire, and other
