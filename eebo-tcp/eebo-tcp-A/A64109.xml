            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have lived to see Religion painted upon Banners, and thrust out of Churches, and the Temple turned into a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, and that Tabernacle made am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulatory, and covered with skins of Beasts and torn Curtains, and God to be worshipped not as he is the <hi>Father of our Lord Iesus</hi> (an afflicted Prince, the King of sufferings) nor, as <hi>the God of peace</hi> (which two appellatives God newly took upon him in the New Testament, and glories in for ever:) but he is owned now rather as the <hi>Lord of Hosts,</hi> which title he was pleased to lay aside when the Kingdom of the Gospel was preached by the Prince of peace But when Religion puts on Armor, and God is not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by his New Testament titles, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion may have in it the power of the Sword, but not the power of Godliness;
<pb facs="tcp:115792:5"/>
and we may complain of this to God, and amongst them that are afflicted, but we have no remedy, but what we must expect from the fellowship of Christs sufferings; and the returns of the God of peace. In the mean time, and now that Religion pretends to stranger actions upon new principles; and men are apt to prefer a prosperous errour before an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted truth; and some will think they are religious enough if their worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings have in them the prevailing ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; and the Ministers of Religion are so scattered that they cannot unite to stop the inundation, and from Chaires or Pulpits, from their Synods or Tribunals, chastise the iniquity of the errour and the ambition of evil Guides, and the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity of the willingly seduced multitude; and that those few good people who have no other plot in their religion but to serve God and save their soules, do want such assistances of ghostly counsel as may serve their emergent needs, and assist their endeavours in the acquist of vertues, and relieve their dangers when they are tempted to sinne and death, I thought I had reasons enough inviting me to draw into one body those advices
<pb facs="tcp:115792:5"/>
which the severall necessities of many men must use at some time or other, and many of them, daily: that by a collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of holy precepts they might lesse feel the want of personall and attending Guides, and that the rules for conduct of soules might be committed to a Book which they might alwayes have; since they could not alwayes have a Prophet at their needs, nor be suffered to go up to the house of the Lord to inquire of the appointed Oracles.</p>
            <p>I know, my Lord, that there are some interested persons who adde scorn to the afflictions of the Church of <hi>ENGLAND,</hi> and because she is afflicted by Men, call her <hi>forsaken of the Lord,</hi> and because her solemn assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies are scattered, think that the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is lost, and the Church divorc'd from God, supposing CHRIST (who was a Man of sorrows) to be angry with his Spouse when she is like him, [for that's the true state of the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour] and that he who promised his Spirit to assist his servants in their troubles, will, because they are in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble take away the <hi>Comforter</hi> from them,
<pb facs="tcp:115792:6"/>
who cannot be a comforter, but while he cures our sadnesses, and relieves our sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, and turnes our persecutions into joyes, and Crowns, &amp; Scepters. But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the present state of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> I consider, that because we now want the blessings of external com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in many degrees, and the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of a prosperous and unafflicted people, we are to take estimate of our selves with single judgements, and every Man is to give sentence concerning the state of his own soul by the precepts and rules of our <hi>Lawgiver,</hi> not by the after decrees and usages of the Church; that is, by the essential parts of Religion rather then by the uncertain significations of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny exteriour adherencies: for though it be uncertain, when a Man is the Member of a Church, whether he be a Member of Christ or no, because in the Churches Net there are fishes good and bad; yet we may be sure that if we be Members of Christ, we are of a Church to all purposes of spiritual religion and salvation: and in order to this give me leave to speak this great truth.</p>
            <p>That Man does certainly belong to God, who <hi rend="sup">1</hi> Believes and is baptized into all
<pb facs="tcp:115792:6"/>
the Articles of the Christian faith, and studies to improve his knowledge in the matters of God, so as may best make him to live a holy life. <hi rend="sup">2</hi> He that in obedience to Christ worships God diligently, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, and constantly with natural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that is, of prayer, praises, and thanksgiving. <hi rend="sup">3</hi> He that takes all oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities to remember Christs death by a frequent Sacrament (as it can be had) or else by inward acts of understanding, will, and memory (which is the spiritual communion) supplies the want of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal rite. <hi rend="sup">4</hi> He that lives chastly. <hi rend="sup">5</hi> And is merciful. <hi rend="sup">6</hi> And despises the World, using it as a Man, but never suffering it to rif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e a duty. <hi rend="sup">7</hi> And is just in his dealing, and diligent in his calling. <hi rend="sup">8</hi> He that is humble in his spirit. <hi rend="sup">9</hi> And obedient to Government. <hi rend="sup">10</hi> And content in his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune and imployment. <hi rend="sup">11</hi> He that does his duty because he loves God. <hi rend="sup">12</hi> And e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially if after all this he be afflicted, &amp; patient, or prepared to suffer affliction for the cause of God. The Man that hath these twelve signes of grace &amp; predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation does as certainly belong to <hi>God,</hi> &amp; is his Son, as surely as he is his creature.</p>
            <p>And if my brethren in persecution, and
<pb facs="tcp:115792:7"/>
               <hi>in the bands of the Lord Iesus</hi> can truly shew these markes, they shall not need be troubled that others can shew a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous outside, great revenues, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick assemblies, uninterrupted successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Bishops, prevailing Armies, or any arme of flesh, or lesse certain circumstance. These are the markes of the Lord Jesus, and the characters of a Christian: This is a good Religion: and these things Gods grace hath put into our powers, and Gods Lawes have made to be our duty, and the nature of Men, and the needs of Common-wealths have made to be necessary: the other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents &amp; pomps of a Church are things without our power, and are not in our choice; they are good to be used when they may be had, and they help to illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate or advantage it: but if any of them constitute a Church in the being of a society and a Government, yet they are not of its constitution as it is Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and hopes to be saved.</p>
            <p>And now the case is so with us that we are reduced to that Religion which no Man can forbid; which we can keep in the midst of a persecution; by which the Martyrs in the dayes of our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb facs="tcp:115792:7"/>
went to Heaven; that by which we can be servants of God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Spirit of Christ, and make use of his comforts, and live in his love, and in charity with all men; and they that do so cannot perish.</p>
            <p>My Lord, I have now described some general lines and features of that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion which I have more particularly set down in the following pages: in which I have neither served nor dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served the interest of any party of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians as they are divided by unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table names from the rest of their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; and no Man will have reason to be angry with me for refusing to min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle in his unnecessary or vitious quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels: especially while I study to doe him good by conducting him in the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row way to Heaven, without intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating him in the Labyrinths and wilde turnings of Questions, and uncertaine talkings. I have told what Men ought to do; and by what means they may be assisted; and in most cases I have also told them why; and yet with as much quicknesse as I could thinke ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to establish a Rule, and not to ingage in Homily or Discourse. In the
<pb facs="tcp:115792:8"/>
use of which Rules (although they are plain, useful, and fitted for the best, and for the worst understandings, and for the needs of all men, yet) I shall desire the Reader to proceed with the following advices.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They that will with profit make use of the proper instruments of vertue, must so live, as if they were alwayes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Physicians hand. For the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels of Religion are not to be applyed to the distempers of the soul, as men use to take Hellebore; but they must dwell together with the Spirit of a man, and be twisted about his understanding for ever: They must be used like nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; that is, by a daily care and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; not like a single medicine, and upon the actual pressure of a present ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity. For counsels and wise discourses applyed to an actual distemper, at the best are but like strong smels to an Epileptick person, sometimes they may raise him, but they never cure him. The following rules if they be made familiar to our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and the thoughts of every day, may make Vertue and Religion become easy and habitual: but when the temptation is present, and hath already seized upon
<pb facs="tcp:115792:8"/>
some portions of our consent, we are not so apt to be counsel'd, and we finde no gust or relish in the Precept: the les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons are the same, but the instrument is unstrung, or out of tune.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In using the instruments of vertue we must be curious to distinguish instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from duties; and prudent advices from necessary injunctions; and if by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other means the duty can be secured, let there be no scruples stirred concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any other helps; onely, if they can in that case strengthen and secure the duty, or help towards perseverance, let let them serve in that station in which they can be placed. For there are some persons in whom the Spirit of God hath breathed so bright a flame of love, that they do all their acts of vertue by perfect choice, and without objection; and their zeal is warmer then that it will be allayed by temptation: and to such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons mortification by Philosophical in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments, as fasting, sackcloth, and other rudenesses to the body is wholly useless: It is alwayes a more uncertain means to acquire any vertue, or secure any duty; &amp; if love hath filled all the corners of our soul, it alone is able to do all the work of God.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb facs="tcp:115792:9"/>3. Be not nice in stating the obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Religion; but where the duty is necessary, and the means very reasonable in it self, dispute not too busily whether in all Circumstances it can fit thy particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; but <hi>super totam materiam,</hi> upon the whole, make use of it. For it is a good signe of a great Religion, and no impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence when we have sufficiently consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the substance of affairs, then to be easy, humble, obedient, apt and credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in the circumstances which are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to us in particular by our spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Guides, or in general, by all wise men in cases not unlike. He that gives Almes, does best, not alwayes to consider the minutes and strict measures of his ability, but to give freely, incuriously and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly. A man must not weigh grains in the accounts of his repentance; but for a great sinne have a great sorrow, and a great severity; and in this take the ordinary advices; though it may be, a lesse rigour might not be insuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient: <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, or Arithmeticall measures, especially of our own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioning, are but arguments of want of Love, and of forwardnesse in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;

or else are instruments of scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and then become dangerous. Use the rule heartily and enough, and there will be no harme in thy errour, if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny should happen.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If thou intendest heartily to serve God, and avoid sinne in any one instance, refuse not the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest and most severe advice that is prescribed in order to it, though possibly it be a stranger to thee; for whatsoever it be, custome will make it easy.</p>
            <p n="5">5. When many instruments for the obtaining any vertue or restraining any vice are propounded, observe which of them fits thy person, or the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of thy need, and use it rather then the other: that by this means thou may'st be engaged to watch and use spiritual arts and observation about thy soul. Concerning the managing of which as the interest is greater, so the necessities are more, and the cases more intricate, and the accidents and dangers greater and more importunate; and there is greater skill required then in the securing an estate, or restoring health to an infirme

body. I wish all men in the world did heartily believe so much of this as is true; it would very much help to do the work of God.</p>
            <p>Thus (My Lord) I have made bold by your hand to reach out this little scroll of cautions to all those who by seeing your honour'd name set before my Book, shall by the fairnes of such a Frontispiece be invited to look into it. I must confess it cannot but look like a designe in me, to borrow your name and beg your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage to my book, that if there be no other worth in it, yet at least it may have the splendour and warmth of a burning glasse, which borrowing a flame from the Eye of Heaven, shines and burns by the rayes of the Sun its patron. I will not quit my self from the suspicion: for I cannot pretend it to be a present either of it self fit to be offered to such a Perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, or any part of a just return, (but I humbly desire you would own it for an acknowledgement) of those great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearments, and noblest usages you have past upon me: But so, men in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, give a piece of Gum, or the fat of a cheap Lamb in Sacrifice to him that gives them all that they have or need:
<pb facs="tcp:115792:10"/>
and unlesse He who was pleased to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy your Lordship as a great Minister of his Providence in making a Promise of his good to me, the meanest of his servants [<hi>that he would never leave me nor forsake me</hi>] shall enable me by greater services of Religion to pay my great Debt to your Honour, I must still in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease my score; since I shall now spend as much in my needs of pardon for this boldnesse, as in the reception of those favours by which I stand accountable to your Lordship in all the bands of service and gratitude; though I am in the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est sense of duty and affection</p>

               <head>CHAP. I. Consideration of the general instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and means serving to a holy Life: by way of Introduction.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is necessary that every Man should consider, that since God hath given him an excellent na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, wisdom and choice, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding soul, and an immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal spirit, having made him Lord over the Beasts, and but a little lower then the Angels; he hath also appointed for him a work and a service great enough to imploy those a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities, and hath also designed him to a state of life after this, to which he can onely arrive by that service and obedience. And therefore as every man is wholly Gods own portion by the title of creation: so all our labours and care, all our powers and faculties must be wholly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the service of God, even all the dayes of our life, that this life being ended, we may live with him for ever.</p>
               <p>Neither is it sufficient that we think of the service of God as a work of the least necessity,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:115792:14"/>
or of small imployment, but that it be done by us as God intended it; that it be done with great earnestnesse and passion, with much zeal and desire: that we refuse no labour, that we bestow upon it much time, that we use the best guides, and arrive at the end of glory by all the wayes of grace, of prudence and religion.</p>
               <p>And indeed if we consider how much of our lives is taken up by the needs of nature, how many years are wholly spent before we come to any use of reason, how many years more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that reason is useful to us to any great pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses, how imperfect our discourse is made by our evil education, false principles, ill company, bad examples, and want of experience; how many parts of our wisest and best years are spent in eating and sleeping, in necessary busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, and unnecessary vanities, in worldly ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilities, and lesse useful circumstances, in the learning arts and sciences, languages or trades; that little portion of hours that is left for the practises of piety, and religious walking with God, is so short and trifling, that were not the goodnesse of God infinitely great, it might seem unreasonable or impossible for us to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of him eternal joyes in heaven, even af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the well spending those few minutes which are left for God, and Gods service, after we have served our selves, and our own occasions.</p>
               <p>And yet it is considerable, that the fruit which comes from the many dayes of recreation and vanity is very little, and although we scatter much, yet we gather but little profit: but from the few hours we spend in prayer and the exercises of a pious life, the return is great and profitable; and what we sowe in the minutes and spare portions of a few years, grows up
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:115792:14"/>
to crowns and scepters in a happy and a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous eternity.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Therefore, Although it cannot be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd, that the greatest part of our time be spent in the direct actions of devotion and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, yet it will become, not onely a duty, but also a great providence to lay aside for the services of God, and the businesses of the Spirit as much as we can: because God rewards our minutes with long and eternal happinesse; and the greater portion of our time we give to God, the more we treasure up for our selves; and <hi>No man is a better Merchant than he that layes out his time upon God, and his money upon the Poor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Onely it becomes us to remember and to adore Gods goodnesse for it, that God hath not onely permitted us to serve the necessities of our nature, but hath made them to become parts of our duty; that if we by directing these actions to the glory of God intend them as instruments to continue our persons in his service, he by adopting them into religion may turn our nature into grace, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept our natural actions,<note place="margin">

               <p n="3">3. To which if we adde, that in these and all
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:115792:15"/>
other actions of our lives we alwayes stand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, acting, and speaking and thinking in his presence, and that it matters not that our conscience is seal'd with secresie, since it lies open to God, it will concern us to behave our selves carefully, as in the presence of our Judge.</p>
               <p>These three considerations rightly manag'd, and applyed to the several parts and instances of our lives, will be like <hi>Elisha</hi> stretched upon the childe, apt to put life and quicknesse into every part of it, and to make us live the life of grace, and do the work of God.</p>
               <p>I shall therefore by way of introduction re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce these three to practise, and shew how eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Christian may improve all and each of these to the advantage of piety, in the whole course of his life: that if he please to bear but one of them upon his spirit, he may feel the benefit, like an universal instrument, helpful in all spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and temporal actions.</p>

                  <p>God hath given to man a short time here upon earth, and yet upon this short time eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity depends: but so, that for every hour of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:115792:15"/>
our life (after we are persons capable of laws, &amp; know good from evil) we must give account to the great Judge of Men and Angels. And this is it which our blessed Saviour told us, that we must account for <hi>every idle word</hi>; not meaning, that every word which is not designd to edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, or is lesse prudent, shall be reckoned for a sin, but that the time which we spend in our idle talking and unprofitable discoursings, that time which might and ought to have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to spiritual and useful purposes, that is to be accounted for.</p>
                  <p>For we must remember, that we have a great work to do, many enemies to conquer, many evils to prevent, much danger to run through, many difficulties to be master'd, many necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to serve, and much good to do, many chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to provide for, or many friends to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, or many poor to relieve, or many diseases to cure, besides the needs of nature, and of relation, our private and our publick cares, and duties of the world, which necessity and the Providence of God hath adopted into the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of <hi>Religion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And that we need not fear this instrument to be a snare to us, or that the duty must end in scruple, vexation, and eternal fears, we must remember, that the life of every man may be so ordered (and indeed must,) that it may be a perpetual serving of God: The greatest trouble and most busy trade, and wordly incombrances, when they are necessary or charitable, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable in order to any of those ends, which we are bound to serve whether publick or private, being a doing Gods work. For God provides the good things of the world to serve the needs of nature, by the labours of the Plowman, the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:115792:16"/>
skill and pains of the Artisan, and the dangers and traffick of the Merchant: These men are in their callings the Ministers of the Divine providence, and the stewards of the creation, and servants of the great family of God, <hi>the World,</hi> in the imployment of procuring neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries for food and clothing, ornament and Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick. In their proportions also, a King and a Priest, and a Prophet, a Judge and an Advocate, doing the works of their imployment accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their proper rules, are doing the work of God, because they serve those necessities which God hath made, and yet made no provisions for them but by their Ministery. So that no man can complain, that his calling takes him off from religion, his calling it self and his very worldly imployment, in honest trades and offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces is a serving of God, and if it be moderately pursued, and according to the rules of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an prudence, will leave void spaces enough for prayers and retirements of a more spiritual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
                  <p>God hath given every man work enough to do, that there shall be no room for idlenesse, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nd yet hath so ordered the world, that there shall be space for devotion. He that hath the fewest businesses of the world, is called upon to spend more time in the dressing of his soul, and he that hath the most affairs, may so order them, that they shall be a service of God; whilst at certain periods they are blessed with prayers and actions of religion, and all day long are hallowed by a holy intention.</p>
                  <p>However, so long as Idlenesse is quite shut out from our lives, all the sins of wantonnesse, softnesse and effeminacy are prevented, and there is but little room left for temptation:
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:115792:16"/>
and therefore to a busie man temptation is fain to climbe up together with his businesses, and sins creep upon him onely by accidents and occasions; whereas to an idle person they come in a full body, and with open violence, and the impudence of a restlesse importunity.</p>
                  <p>Idlenesse is called <hi>the sin of Sodom and her daughters,</hi>

                  <p>Idlenesse is the greatest prodigality in the world: it throwes away that, which is invalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in respect of its present use, and irrepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble when it is past, being to be recovered by no power of art or nature.

                     <p n="8">8. Let your imployment be such as may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a reasonable person; and not be a busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse fit for children or distracted people; but fit <hi>for your age and understanding.</hi> For a man may be very idlely busy, and take great pains to so little purpose, that in his labors and expence of time he shall serve no end but of folly, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.

Thus <hi>Nero</hi> went up and down <hi>Greece,</hi> and challenged the Fidlers at their trade. <hi>Aeropus</hi> a Macedonian King made Lanterns. <hi>Harcatius</hi> the King of <hi>Parthia</hi> was a Mole-catcher: and <hi>Biantes</hi> the Lydian filed needles. He that is appointed to minister in holy things, must not suffer secular affairs and sordid arts to eat up great portions of his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment: a Clergy man must not keep a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, nor a Judge be an Inne-keeper; and it was a great idlenesse in <hi>Theophylact</hi> the Patriarch of <hi>C.

Such im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments are the diseases of labour, and the rust of time which it contracts, not by lying still, but by dirty imployment.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. Let your imployment be such <hi>as becomes a Christian,</hi> that is, in no sence mingled with sin; for he that takes pains to serve the ends of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousnesse, or ministers to anothers lust, or keeps a shop of impurities or intemperance, is idle in the worst sence; for every hour so spent runs him backward, and must be spent again in the remaining and shorter part of his life, and spent better.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. Persons of <hi>great quality, and of no trade,</hi> are to be most prudent and curious in their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment and traffick of time.

skill to spend their time: but most miserable are they, if such misgovernment and unskilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse make them fall into vitious and baser company, and drive on their time by the sad minutes and periods of sin and death. * They that are <hi>learned</hi> know the worth of time, and the manner how well to improve a day; and they are to prepare themselves for such pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses, in which they may be most useful in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to arts of arms: to counsel in publick, or government in their Countrey: But for others of them that are <hi>unlearn'd,</hi> let them choose good company, such as may not tempt them to a vice, or joyn with them in any; but that may supply their defects by counsel and discourse, by way of conduct or conversation. Let them learn easy and useful things, read history, and the laws of the Land, learn the customs of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, the condition of their own estate, profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and charitable contrivances of it: let them study prudently to govern their families, learn the burdens of their Tenants, the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of their neighbours, and in their propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion supply them, and reconcile their enmities, and prevent their Law-suits, or quickly end them, and in this glut of leisure and disimploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, let them set apart greater portions of their time for religion, and the necessities of their Souls.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. Let the <hi>women of noble birth</hi> and great fortunes do the same things in their propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and capacities, nurse their children, look to the affairs of the house, visit poor cottages, and relieve their necessities, be curteous to the neighbourhood, learn in silence of their hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, or their spiritual Guides, read good books, pray often, and speak little, and <hi>learn to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:115792:19"/>
do good works for necessary uses,</hi> for by that phrase S. <hi>Paul</hi> expresses the obligation of Christian women to good houswifery, and charitable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions for their family and neighbourhood.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. Let all persons of <hi>all conditions</hi> avoid all delicacy and nicenesse in their <hi>clothing</hi> or <hi>diet,</hi> because such softnesse engages them upon great mispendings of their time, while they dresse and combe out all their opportunities of their morning devotion, and half the dayes severity, and sleep out the care and provision for their Souls.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. Let every one of every condition avoid <hi>curiosity,</hi> and all enquiry into things that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern them not. For all businesse in things that concerns us not, is an imploying our time to no good of ours, and therefore not in order to a happy Eternity. In this account our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours necessities are not to be reckoned; for they concern us as one member is concern'd in the grief of another; but going from house to house, tatlers, and busie-bodies, which are the canker and rust of idlenesse, as id<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As much as may be cut off all <hi>impertinent and uselesse imployments</hi> of your life, unnecessary and phantastick visits, long waitings upon great personages, where neither dutie nor necessity, nor charity obliges us, all vain meetings, all laborious trifles, and whatsoever spends much time to no real, civil, religious, or charitable purpose.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. Let not your <hi>recreations</hi> be lavish spend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of your time, but choose such which are healthful, short, transient, recreative, and apt

                  <p>THat we should intend and designe Gods glory in every action we do, whether it be natural or chosen, is expressed by S. <hi>Paul, Whether ye eat or drink, do all to the glory of God</hi>:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Blessed be that goodnesse and grace of God, which out of infinite desire to glorifie and save mankinde, would make the very works of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture capable of becoming acts of vertue, that all our life time we may do him service.</p>
                  <p>This grace is so excellent, that it sanctifies the most <hi>common action</hi> of our life, and yet so necessary, that without it the very best actions of our devotion are imperfect and vitious. For he that prayes out of custome, or gives almes for praise, or fasts to be accounted religious, is but a Pharisee in his devotion, and a beggar in his alms, and an hypocrite in his fasts. But a
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:115792:22"/>
holy end sanctifies all these, and all other acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which can be made holy, and gives distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to them and procures acceptance.</p>
                  <p>For, as to know the end, distinguishes a Man from a Beast: so to chuse a good end, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishes him from an evil man. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> repeated his good deeds upon his sick bed, and obtained favour of God; but the Pharisee was accounted insolent for doing the same thing; because this man did it to upbraid his brother, the other to obtain a mercy of God. <hi>Zecharias</hi> questioned with the Angel about his message, and was made speechlesse for his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulity; but the blessed Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned too, and was blamelesse; for she did it to enquire after the <hi>manner</hi> of the thing; but he did not believe the <hi>thing it self</hi>: He doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of Gods power, or the truth of the Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <div type="subsection">
                     <head>Rules for our intentions.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. In every action reflect upon <hi>the end</hi>; and in your undertaking it, consider <hi>why</hi> you do it, and what you propound <hi>to your self for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> and <hi>to your action as its end.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Begin every action in the Name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: the meaning of which is, that we be careful, that we do not the action without the permis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion or warrant of God. 2. That we designe it to the glory of God, if not in the direct acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet at least in its consequence; if not in the particular, yet at least in the whole order of things and accidents. 3. That it may be so blessed, that what you intend for innocent and holy purposes, may not by any chance or abuse, or misunderstanding of men be turned into e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, or made the occasion of sin.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Let every action of concernment be <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun with prayer,</hi> that God would not onely blesse the action, but sanctifie your purpose; and make an oblation of the action to God: holy and well intended actions being the best
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:115792:23"/>
oblations and presents we can make to God; and when God is entitled to them, he will the rather keep the fire upon the Altar bright and shining.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. In the prosecution of the action, renew and re-inkindle your purpose by <hi>short ejacula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> to these purposes. [<hi>Not unto us O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy Name let all praise be given:</hi>] and consider, [<hi>Now I am working the work of God: I am his servant, I am in a happy imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I am doing my Masters businesse; I am not at my own dispose, I am using his talents, and all the gain must be his:</hi>] for then be sure, as the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is his, so the reward shall be thine. If thou bringest his goods home with increase, he will make thee ruler over Cities.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Have a care that while the Altar thus sends up a holy fume, thou doest not suffer the birds to come &amp; carry away the Sacrifice: that is, let not that which began well, and was intended for Gods glory, <hi>decline</hi> and end in thy owne praise, or temporal satisfaction, or a sin. A sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry told to represent the vilenesse of unchastity is well begun; but if thy female auditor be pleased with thy language, and begins rather to like thy person for thy story, then to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the crime:<note place="margin">

                     <p n="6">6. If any <hi>accidental event</hi> which was not first intended by thee can come to passe, let it not be taken into thy purposes, nor at all be made use of; as if by telling a true story you can do an ill turn to your enemy, by no means do it; but when the temptation is found out, turn all thine enmity upon that.</p>
                     <p n="7">
                        <pb n="21" facs="tcp:115792:23"/>7 In every more solemne action of Religion, joyn together <hi>many good ends,</hi> that the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of them may entertain all your affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and that when any one ceases, the purity of your intention may be supported by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther supply. He that fasts onely to tame a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious body, when he is provided of a reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy either in Grace or Nature, may be tempted to leave off his fasting. But he that in his fast intends the mortification of every unruly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, an accustoming himself to bear the yoke of the Lord, a contempt of the pleasures of meat and drink, humiliation of all wilder thoughts, obedience, and humility, austerity and charity, and the convenience and assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to devotion, and to do an act of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; whatever happens, will have reason enough to make him to continue his purpose, and to sanctifie it. And certain it is, the more good ends are designed in an action, the more degrees of excellency the man obtains.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. If any temptation to spoil your purpose happens in a religious duty, do not presently <hi>omit the action,</hi> but rather strive to rectifie your intention and to mortifie the temptation. S. <hi>Bernard</hi> taught us this rule. For when the Devil observing him to preach excellently, and to do much benefit to his hearers, tempted him to vain glory, hoping that the good man to avoid that, would cease preaching, he gave this answer onely, <hi>I neither began for thee, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for thee will I make an end.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="9">9. In all actions which are of <hi>long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,</hi> deliberation and abode, let your holy and pious intention be <hi>actual,</hi> that is, that it be by a special prayer, or action, by a peculiar act of resignation or oblation be given to God:
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:115792:24"/>
but in smaller actions, and little things, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, fail not to secure a pious <hi>habitual</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, that is, that it be included within your general care, that no action have an ill end; and that it be comprehended in your general prayers, whereby you offer your self and all you do to Gods glory.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. Call not <hi>every temporal end,</hi> a defiling of thy intention, but onely, 1. When it contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts any of the ends of God, or 2. When it is principally intended in an action of religion. For sometimes a temporal end is part of our duty: and such are all the actions of our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, whether our imployment be religious or civil. We are commanded to provide for our family: but if the Minister of Divine offices shall take upon him that holy calling for cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous or ambitious ends, or shall not designe the glory of God principally and especially, he hath polluted his hands and his heart; and the fire of the Altar is quenched, or it sends forth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the smoak of mushromes, or unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant gums. And it is a great unworthinesse to prefer the interest of a creature before the ends of God the Almighty Creator.</p>
                     <p>But because many cases may happen in which a mans <hi>heart may deceive him,</hi> and he may not well know what is in his own spirit; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by these following signes we shall best make a judgement <hi>whether our intentions be pure, and our purposes holy.</hi>

                     <head>Signes of purity of intention.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. It is probable our hearts are right with God,<note place="margin">See Sect. 1. of this Chapt. Rule 18.</note> and our intentions innocent and pious, if we set upon actions of religion or civil life with an <hi>affection proportioned</hi> to the quality of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:115792:24"/>
the work; that we act our temporal affairs with a desire no greater then our necessity; and that in actions of religion we be zealous, active, and operative, so far as prudence will permit; but in all cases, that we value a religious designe before a temporal; when otherwise they are in equal order to their several ends: that is, that whatsoever is necessary in order to our souls health be higher esteemed than what is for bodily; and the necessities, the indispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble necessities of the spirit be served before the needs of nature, when they are required in their several circumstances: Or plainer yet; when we choose any temporal inconvenience, rather than commit a sin, and when we choose to do a duty rather than to get gain. But he that does his recreation, or his merchandise cheerfully, promptly, readily and busily, and the works of religion slowly, flatly, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out appetite, and the spirit moves like <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raohs</hi> chariots when the wheels were off, it is a signe that his heart is not right with God, but it cleaves too much to the world.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is likely our hearts are pure, and our intentions spotlesse, when we are <hi>not solicitous</hi> of the <hi>opinion</hi> and censures of men; but onely that we do our duty, and be accepted of God. For our eyes will certainly be fixed there from whence we expect our reward: and if we desire that God should approve us, it is a signe we do his work, and expect him our pay-Master.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. He that does as well <hi>in private</hi> between God and his own soul <hi>as in publick,</hi> in Pulpits, in Theatres, and Market-places, hath given himself a good testimony that his purposes are full of honesty, noblenesse and integrity. For

what <hi>Helkanah</hi> said to the Mother of <hi>Samuel,</hi> Am not I better to thee then ten sons?

S. <hi>Iames</hi> converted but eight persons, when he preacht in <hi>Spain</hi>; and our blessed Saviour converted fewer, then his own Disciples did: And if thy labours prove unprosperous, if thou beest much troubled at that, it is certain thou didst not think thy self secure of a reward for your inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which you might have done if it had been pure and just.</p>

It was a great ingenuity in <hi>Moses,</hi> that wished <hi>all the people</hi> might be <hi>prophets</hi>; but if he had designed his own honour, he would have prophecyed alone. But he that desires onely that the work of God and religion shall go on, is pleased with it, who ever is the instrument.</p>

When we are <hi>not sollicitous</hi> concerning the <hi>instruments</hi> and <hi>means</hi> of our actions, but use those means which God hath laid before us, with resignation, indifferency and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse, it is a good signe that we are rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent upon the end of Gods glory, than our own conveniency or temporal satisfaction. He that is indifferent whether he serve God in riches or in poverty is rather a seeker of God, than of himself; and he that will throw away a good book, because it is not curiously guilded, is more desirous to please his eye, than to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his understanding.</p>

                     <p>When our <hi>intentions</hi> are thus <hi>ballanced,</hi> regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated and discerned, we may consider, 1.

Thus <hi>almes</hi> are for <hi>charity: fasting</hi> for <hi>temperance: prayer</hi> is for <hi>religion: humiliation</hi> is for <hi>humility: austerity</hi> or <hi>sufferance</hi> is in order to the vertue of <hi>patience</hi>; and when these actions fail of their several ends, or are not directed to their own purposes, <hi>alms</hi> are mispent; <hi>fasting</hi> is an impertinent trouble; <hi>prayer</hi> is but lip-labour; <hi>humiliation</hi> is but hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie; <hi>sufferance</hi> is but vexation; for such were the <hi>alms</hi> of the Pharisee, the <hi>fast</hi> of <hi>Ieza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,</hi> the <hi>prayer</hi> of <hi>Iudah</hi> reproved by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Isaiah,</hi> the <hi>humiliation</hi> of <hi>Ahab,</hi> the <hi>martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> of <hi>Hereticks</hi>; in which nothing is given to God but the body, or <hi>the forms of religion,</hi> but the soul, and <hi>the power of godlinesse</hi> is wholly wanting.</p>

                     <head>Several manners of the divine presence.</head>
                     <p>The presence of God is understood by us in several manners and to several purposes.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. God is present <hi>by his essence,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is infinite cannot be contained within the limits of any place: and because he is of an essential purity, and spiritual nature, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be undervalued by being supposed present in the places of unnatural uncleannesse: because as the sun reflecting upon the mud of strands and shores is unpolluted in its beams: so is
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:115792:28"/>
God not dishonoured when we suppose him in every of his Creaturer, and in every part of every one of them, and is still as unmixt with any unhandfome adherence, as is the soul in the bowels of the body.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. God is every where present <hi>by his power.</hi> He roules the Orbs of Heaven with his hand, he fixes the Earth with his Foot, he guides all the Creatures with his Eye, and refreshes them with his influence: He makes the powers of Hell to shake with his terrours, and binds the Devils with his Word, and throws them out with his command; and sends the Angels on Emba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ies with his decrees: He hardens the joynts of Infants, and confirms the bones when they are fashioned beneath secretly in the earth: He it is that assists at the numerous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of fishes, and there is not one hollow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in the bottom of the sea, but he shows himself to be Lord of it, by sustaining these the Creatures that come to dwell in it: And in the wildernesse, the Bittern and the Stork, the Dragon and the Satyr, the Unicorn and the Elk live upon his provisions, and revere his power, and feel the force of his Almightinesse.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. God is <hi>more specially present</hi> in some places by the several and more special manifestations of himself to extraordinary purposes. 1. <hi>By glory</hi>: Thus his fear is in Heaven; because there he fits incircled with all the outward demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations of his glory, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> he is pleased to show to all the inhabitants of those his inward and secret Courts. And thus <hi>they that die in the Lord</hi> may be properly said to be <hi>gone to God</hi>; with whom although they were before, yet now they enter into his Courts, into the secret of his Tabernacle, into the retinue and splendor of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:115792:29"/>
his glory. <hi>That</hi> is called <hi>walking</hi> with God, but <hi>this</hi> is dwelling or being with him. <hi>I desire to be dissolved and to be with Christ,</hi> so said <hi>Paul.</hi> But this manner of the Divine presence is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served for the elect people of God, and for their portion in their countrey.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. God is <hi>by grace and benediction</hi> specially present <hi>in holy places,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 18.20. Heb. 10.25.</note> and in the solemn assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of his servants. If holy people meet in grots and dens of the earth, when persecution or a publick necessity disturbs the publick or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, circumstance, and convenience, God fails not to come thither to them: but God is also by the same or a greater reason present there where they meet <hi>ordinarily, by order, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick authority</hi>: There God is present ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that is, at every such meeting. God will go out of his way to meet his Saints, when them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves are forced out of their way of order by a sad necessity:<note place="margin">1 King. 5 9. Psal. 138 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>.2.</note> but else, Gods <hi>usual way</hi> is to be present in those places where his servants are appointed <hi>ordinarily</hi> to meet. But his presence there signifies nothing but his <hi>readinesse</hi> to hear their prayers, to blesse their persons, to accept their offices, and to like even the circumstance of orderly and publick meeting. For thither, the prayers of consecration, the publick au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority separating it, and Gods love of order, and the reasonable customes of Religion, have in ordinary, and in a certain degree fixed this manner of his presence; and he loves to have it so.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. God is <hi>especially present</hi> in the hearts of his people <hi>by his holy Spirit:</hi> and indeed the hearts of holy men are Temples in the truth of things, and in type and shadow they are of Heaven it self. For God <hi>reigns</hi> in the hearts of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:115792:29"/>
his servants. <hi>There is his Kingdom.</hi> The power of grace hath <hi>subdued</hi> all his enemies. There is, <hi>his power.</hi> They <hi>serve</hi> him night and day and give him thanks and praise; that is, <hi>his glory:</hi> This is the religion and worship of God in the Temple. The temple it self is the heart of man; Christ is the High Priest, who from thence sends up the incense of prayers and joyns them to his own intercession, and presents all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to his Father; and the Holy Ghost by his dwelling there, hath also consecrated it into a Temple;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3 16. 2 Cor. 6 16.</note> and God dwels in our hearts by faith, and Christ by his Spirit, and the Spirit by his purities; so that we are also Cabinets of the Mysterious Trinity; and what is this short of Heaven it self, but as infancy is short of manhood, and letters of words? The same state of life it is, but not the same age. It is <hi>Heaven in a Looking-glasse,</hi> (dark, but yet true) representing the beauties of the soul, and the graces of God, and the images of his eternal glory by the reality of a special presence.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. God is especially present in the <hi>conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> of all persons <hi>good and bad, by way of testimony</hi> and <hi>judgement</hi>: that is, he is there a remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brancer to call our actions to minde, a witnesse to bring them to judgement, and a Judge to acquit or to condemne. And although this manner of presence is in this life after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of this life, that is, imperfect, and we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get many actions of our lives; yet the greatest changes of our state of grace or sin, our most considerable actions are alwayes present, like Capital Letters to an aged and dim eye: and at the day of judgement God shall draw aside the cloud and manifest this manner of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence more notoriously, and make it appear,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:115792:30"/>
that he was an observer of our very thoughts; and that he onely laid those things by which because we covered with dust and negligence they were not then discerned. But when we are risen from our dust and imperfection, they all appear plain and legible.</p>
                     <p>Now the consideration of this great truth is of a very universal use in the whole course of the life of a Christian. All the consequents and effects of it are universal. * He that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members that God stands a <hi>witnesse</hi> and a <hi>judge,</hi> beholding every secrecy; besides his impiety, must have put on impudence if he be not much restrained in his temptation to sin.
<q>For the greatest part of sinnes is taken away, if a man have a witnesse of his conversation: And he is a great despiser of God who sends a Boy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way when he is going to commit fornication, and yet will dare to do it, though he knows God is present, and cannot be sent o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Temperance consists in the actions of the soul principally: for it is a grace that chooses natural means in order to proper and natural and holy ends: It is exercised about eating &amp; drinking, because they are necessary: but
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:115792:49"/>
therefore it permits the use of them onely as they minister to lawful ends: It does not eate and drink for pleasure but for need, and for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshment, which is a part or a degree of need. I deny not but eating and drinking <hi>may be,</hi> and in healthful bodies <hi>alwayes is</hi> with pleasure: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is in nature no greater pleasure, than that all the appetites which God hath made should be satisfied: and a man may choose a morsel that is pleasant, the lesse plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant being rejected as being lesse useful, lesse apt to nourish, or more agreeing with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm stomach, or when the day is festival, by order, or by a private joy. In all these cases it is permitted to receive a more free delight, and to designe it too, as the lesse principal: that is, that the chief reason why we choose the more delicious, be the serving that end for which such refreshments and choices are permitted. But when delight is the only end and rests in it self, and dwells there long, then, eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is not a serving of God, but an inordinate action; because it is not in the way to that end whether God directed it. But the choosing of a delicate before a more ordinary dish is to be done as other humane actions are, in which there are no degrees and precise natural limits descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, but a latitude is indulged: it must be done moderately, prudently, and according to the accounts of wise, religious, and sober men; and then God who gave us such variety of creatures, and our choice to use which we will, may receive glorie from our tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate use, and thanksgiving, and we may use them indifferently without scruple, and a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them to become snares to us, either by too licentious and studied use of them,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:115792:49"/>
or too restrained and scrupulous fear of using them at all, but in such certain circumstances in which no man can be sure he is not mistaken.</p>
                  <p>But temperance in meat and drink is to be estimated by the following measures.</p>
                  <div type="subsection">

                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Eat not hastily and impatiently,</hi> but with such decent and timely action, that your eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be a humane act, subject to delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and choice, and that you may consider in the eating: whereas he that eats hastily, cannot consider particularly of the circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, degrees, and little accidents and chances that happen in his meale; but may contract many little undecencies, and be suddenly sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Eat not delicately, or nicely,</hi> that is, be not troublesome to thy self or others in the choice of thy meats, or the delicacy of thy sauces.

indiscreet curiosity: they would not have the flesh boiled, but raw that they might <hi>rost it with fire.</hi> Not that it was a sin to eat it, or desire meat rosted; but that when it was appointed to be boil'd, they refused it; which declared an intemperate and a nice palate. It is lawful in all senses to comply with a weak and a nice stomach: but not with a nice and curious pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late.

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:115792:53"/>
manner to be judged as sicknesse. As every illnesse or violence done to health in every part of its continuance is a part or degree of sicknesse: so is every going off from our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and common temper and our usual severity of behaviour, a degree of drunkennesse. He is not onely drunk that can drink no more; for few are so; but he hath sinned in a degree of drunkennesse who hath done any thing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it beyond his proper measure. But its parts and periods are usually thus reckoned. 1. Apish gestures. 2. Much talking. 3. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate laughing. 4. Dulnesse of sence. 5. Scurrility, that is, wanton, or jeering, or abusive language. 6. An uselesse understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. 7. Stupid sleep. 8. Epilepsies, or fallings, and reelings and beastly vomitings. The least of these, even when the tongue begins to be untyed, is a degree of drunkennesse.</p>
                     <p>But that we may avoyd the sin of intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in meats and drinks, besides the former rules of measures, these counsels also may be useful.</p>

Be not often present at feasts, nor at all in dissolute company, when it may be avoyded; for variety of pleasing objects steals away the heart of man: and company is either violent or enticing; and we are weak or complying, or perhaps desirous enough to be abused. But if you be unavoidably or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discreetly ingaged, let not mistaken civilitie or good nature engage thee, either to the temptation of staying (if thou understandest thy weaknesse) or the sin of drinking inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinately.</p>

For a man is surprized by parts; and while he thinks one glass more will not make him drunk, that one glasse hath disabled him from well discerning his present condition and neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour danger: <hi>while men think themselves wise they become fools</hi>: they think they shall tast the aconite and not dye, or crown their heads with juice of poppy and not be drowsie; and if they drink off the whole vintage, still they think they can swallow another gobler. <note place="margin">Senec. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>But besides these general acts of Chastity which are common to all states of men and women, there are some few things proper to the severals.</p>

                     <head>Acts of virginal Chastity.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. Virgins must remember that the virgini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the body is onely excellent in order to the puritie of the soul: who therefore must consider that since they are in some measure in a condition like that of angels, it is their duty
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:115792:60"/>
to spend much of their time in Angelical im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment: for in the same degree that Virgins live more spiritually then other persons, in the same degree is their virginity a more excellent state: But else it is no better then that of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary or constrained Eunuchs; a misery and a trouble, or else a mere privation, as much without excellency as without mixture.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Virgins must contend for a singular mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty; whose first part must be an ignorance in the distinction of sexes, or their proper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments: or if they accidentally be instructed in that, it must be supplied with an inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency or neglect of all thoughts and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrances of such difference: and the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing parts of it, must be pious and chast thoughts, holy language, and modest carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Virgins must be retired and unpublick: for all freedom and loosenesse of society is a violence done to virginity; not in its natural, but in its moral capacity: that is, it looses part of its severity, strictnesse and opportunity of advantages by publishing that person, whose work is religion, whose company is Angels, whose thoughts must dwell in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and separate from all mixtures of the world.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Virgins have a peculiar obligation to charity: for this is the virginity of the soul; as puritie, integrity, and separation is of the body, which doctrine we are taught by Saint <hi>Peter. Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth thorough the spirit unto unfaigned love of the brethren:</hi>

                     <p n="5">5. These rules are necessary for Virgins that offer that state to God, and mean not to enter into the state of marriage: for they that onely wait the opportunity of a convenient change, are to steer themselves by the general rules of Chastity.</p>

                     <p>For Widows, the fontinel of whose desires hath been opened by the former permissions of the marriage-bed, they must remember.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That God hath now restrain'd the former license, bound up their eyes, and shut up their heart into a narrower compasse, and hath given them sorrow to be a bridle to their desires. A Widow must be a mourner; and she that is not, cannot so well secure the chastity of her proper state.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is against publick honesty to marry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother man so long as she is with childe by her former Husband: and of the same fame it is in a lesser proportion, to marry within the year of mourning: but anciently it was infamous for her to marry, till by common account the body was dissolved into its first principle of earth.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. A Widow must restrain her memory and her fancy: not recalling or recounting her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer permissions and freer licenses with any present delight: for then she opens that sluce which her Husbands death and her own sorrow have shut up.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. A Widow that desires her widowhood should be a state pleasing to God, must spend
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:115792:61"/>
her time as devoted Virgins should, in fastings and prayers, and charity.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. A Widow must forbid her self to use those temporal solaces, which in her former estate were innocent, but now are dangerous.</p>

                  <p>HUmility is the great Ornament and Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el of Christian Religion; that whereby it is distinguished from all the wisdome of the world; it not having been taught by the wise men of the Gentiles; but first put into a discipline, and made part of a religion by our Lord Jesus Christ, who propounded himselfe imitable by his Disciples so signal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in nothing, as in the twinne sisters of Meeknesse and Humility. <hi>Learne of me for I am meek and humble, and ye shall finde rest unto your souls.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For all the World, all that we are, and all that we have; our bodies and our souls, our actions and our sufferings, our conditions at home, our accidents abroad, our many sinnes, and our seldome vertues are as so many argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to make our souls dwell low in the deep valleys of Humility.</p>

                     <head>Arguments against Pride by way of Consideration.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Our Body</hi> is weak and impure, sending out more uncleannesses from its several sinkes then could be endured if they were not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary and natural: and we are forced to passe that through our mouthes, which as soon as we see upon the ground, we loathe like rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tennesse and vomiting.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Our strength</hi> is inferiour to that of many Beasts, and our infirmities so many that we
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:115792:65"/>
are forced to dresse and tend Horses and Asses, that they may help our needs, and relieve our wants.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Our beauty</hi> is in colour inferiour to many flowers, and in proportion of parts it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then nothing. For even a Dog hath parts as well proportion'd and fitted to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses, and the designes of his nature, as we have: and when it is most florid and gay, three fits of an ague can change it into yellownesse and leanness, and the hollowness and wrinkles of deformity.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Our learning</hi> is then best when it teaches most humility: but to be proud of Learning is the greatest ignorance in the World. For our learning is so long in getting, and so very imperfect, that the greatest Clerke knowes not the thousand part of what hee is ignorant; and knowes so uncertainly what he seemes to know, and knowes no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then a Fool, or a Childe, even wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Hee that is proud of riches is a Foole.</hi> For if he be exalted above his Neighbours because hee hath more gold, how much inferiour is hee to a Gold Mine? How

much is he to give place to a chain of Pearl, or a knot of Diamonds? For certainly that hath the greatest excellence from whence he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives all his gallantry and preheminence over his Neighbours.</p>

                     <p n="7">7. <hi>He that is proud of his birth</hi> is proud of the blessings of others, not of himself: for if his parents were more eminent in any cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance then their Neighbours, he is to thank God, and to rejoyce in them; but still he may be a Fool, or unfortunate, or deform'd; and when himself was born, it was indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to him whether his Father were a King or a Peasant; for he knew not any thing, nor chose any thing: and most commonly it is true, that he that boasts of his Ancestors, who were the founders and raisers of a Noble Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, doth confesse that he hath in himself a lesse vertue and a lesse honour, and therefore that he is degenerated.</p>

His death is certain, alwayes ready at the door, but never far off *.

                     <p>The grace of humility is exercised by these following rules.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Think not thy self better for any thing that happens to thee from without. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though thou mayest by gifts bestowed upon thee be better then another, as one horse is better then another, that is, of more use to others; yet as thou art a man, thou hast no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to commend thee to thy self, but that

onely by which thou art a man; that is, by what thou choosest and refusest.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Humility consists not in railing against thy self, or wearing mean clothes, or going softly and submissely; but in a hearty and real evil or mean opinion of thy self. Believe thy self an unworthy person, heartily, as thou believest thy self to be hungry, or poor, or sick, when thou art so.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Whatsoever evil thou sayest of thy self be content that others should think to be true: and if thou callest thy self <hi>fool,</hi> be not angry if another say so of thee: For if thou thinkest so truely, all men in the world desire other men to be of their opinion; and he is an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite that accuses himself before others, with an intent not to be believed. But he that calls himself intemperate, foolish, lustful, and is angry when his neighbours call him so, is both a false and a proud person<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

If other ends be mingled with thy honour, as if the glory of God, or charity, or necessity, or any thing of prudence be thy end, you are not tyed to omit your discourse, or your designe that you may avoid praise, but pursue your end, though praise come along in the Company. Onely let not praise be the designe.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. When thou hast said or done any thing for which thou receivest praise or estimation, take it indifferently, and return it to God, reflecting upon him as the Giver of the gift, or the blesser of the action, or the aid of the designe: and give God thanks for making thee an instrument of his glory, or the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of others.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Secure a good name to thy self by li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving vertuously and humbly: but let this good name be nursed abroad, and never be brought home to look upon it: let others use it for their own advantage: let them speak of it if they please, but do not thou at all use it, but as an instrument to do God glory, and thy neighbour more advantage. Let thy face like <hi>Moses</hi> shine to others, but make no looking glasses for thy self.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Take no content in praise when it is offered thee: but let thy rejoycing in Gods gift be allayed with feare, lest this good bring thee to evill. Use the praise as

Look not upon them as scattered in the course of a long life: now, an intemperate anger, then, too full a meal: now, idle talking, and another time impatience: but unite them into one continued representation, and remember, that he whose life seems fair, by reason that his faults are scattered at large distances, in the severall parts of his life, yet if all his errours and follies were articled against him; the man would seem vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and miserable: and possibly this exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise, really applyed upon thy Spirit, may be usefull.</p>

For since GOD oftentimes hides from his Saints and Servants the sight of those excellent things by which they shine to others (though the darke side of the Lanterne be towards themselves) that hee may secure the grace of humility; it is good that thou doe so thy self: and if thou beholdest a grace of GOD in thee, remember to give him thanks for it, that you may not boast in that which is none of thy own: and consider how thou hast sullyed it, by handling it with dirty fingers, with thy own imperfections, and with mixture of unhandsome circumstances. Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual pride is very dangerous, not onely by reason, it spoiles so many graces by which wee drew nigh to the Kingdome of GOD, but also because it so frequently creeps up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the spirit of holy persons.

to observe his own danger, and to discern his own infirmities, and make discovery of his bad adherencies, is as hard as for a Prince to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit himself to be guided by Tutors, and make himself subject to discipline like the meanest of his servants.</p>

                     <p>Every man hath in his own life sins enough, in his own minde trouble enough, in his own fortune evils enough, and in performance of his offices failings more then enough to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his own enquiry: so that curiositie after the affairs of others, cannot be without envy and an evil minde. What is it to me if my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours Grandfather were a Syrian, or his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother illegitimate, or that another is indebted five thousand pounds, or whether his wife be expensive? But commonly curious persons, (or as the Apostles phrase is) <hi>busie-bodies</hi> are not sollicitous, or inquisitive into the beauty and order of a well governed family, or after the vertues of an excellent person; but if there be any thing for which men keep locks and bars and porters, things that blush to see the light, and either are shameful in manners,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:115792:75"/>
or private in nature, these things are their care and their businesse. * But if great things will satisfie our enquiry, the course of the Sun and Moon, the spots in their faces, the Firmament of Heaven, and the supposed Orbs, the ebbing and flowing of the Sea, are work enough for us: or if this be not, let him tell me, whether the number of the stars be even or odde, and when they began to be so? since some ages have discovered new stars which the former knew not, but might have seen, if they had bin where now they are fix'd. * If these be too trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, search lower, and tell me, why this turfe this year brings forth a Daisie, and the next year a Plantane: why the apple bears his seed in his heart, and wheat bears it in his head: let him tell, why a graft taking nourishment from a crab-stock shall have a fruit more noble then its nurse and parent: let him say, why the best of oyl is at the the top, the best of wine in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and the best of hony at the bottom, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then it is in some liquors that are thinner, and in some that are thicker? But these things are not such as please busie bodies. They must feed upon Tragedies, and stories of misfortunes &amp; crimes; &amp; yet tell them ancient stories of the ravishment of chast maidens, or the debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of nations, or the extream poverty of learned persons, or the persecutions of the old Saints, or the changes of government, and sad accidents hapning in Royal families amongst the <hi>Arsacidae,</hi> the <hi>Caesars,</hi> the <hi>Ptolomies,</hi> these were enough to scratch the itch of knowing sad stories. But unlesse you tell them something <hi>sad and new,</hi> something that is done within the bounds of their own knowledge or rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it seems tedious and unsatisfying; which
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:115792:76"/>
showes plainly it is an evil spirit: envie and idlenesse married together, and begot cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity. Therfore <hi>Plutarch</hi> rarely well compares, curious and inquisitive ears to the execrable gates of cities, out of which onely Malefactors, and hangmen and tragedies passe, nothing that is chast or holy. * If a Physitian should go from house to house unsent for and enquire what wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man hath a Cancer in her bowels, or what man hath a fistula in his colick gut, though he could pretend to cure it, he would be almost as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcome as the disease it self: and therefore it is inhumane to enquire after crimes and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asters without pretence of amending them, but onely to discover them. We are not angry with Searchers and Publicans when they look onely on publick merchandise; but when they break open trunks, and pierce vessels, and unrip packs, and open sealed letters.</p>
                     <p>Curiosity is the direct incontinency of the spirit: and adultery it self in its principle is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times nothing but a curious inquisition af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and envying of another mans inclosed plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures: and there have been many who refused fairer objects that they might ravish an inclosed woman, from her retirement and single posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sour.

When any thing happens to our displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, let us endeavour to take off its trouble by turning it into spiritual or artificial advantage, and handle it on that side, in which it may be useful to the defignes of reason. For there is nothing but hath a double handle, or at least we have two hands to apprehend it. When an enemy reproaches us, let us look on him as an impartial relator of our faults, for he will tell thee truer then thy fondest friend will, and thou mayest call them <hi>precious balms,</hi> though <hi>they break thy head,</hi> and forgive his anger while thou makest use of the plainnesse of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation. <hi>The Ox when he is weary treads surest,</hi> and if there be nothing else in the disgrace but that it makes us to walk warily, and tread sure for fear of our enemies, that is better then to be flattered into pride and carelessenesse. This is the charity of Christian Philosophy, which expounds the sence of the divine providence fairly, and reconciles us to it by a charitable construction: and we may as well refuse all physick if we consider it onely as unpleasant in the tast, and we may finde fault with the rich valleys of Thasus, because they are circled with sharp mountains: but so also we may be in cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity with every unpleasant accident, because though it tast bitter it is intended for health and medicine.</p>
                     <p>If therefore thou fallest from thy imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in publick, take sanctuary in an honest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement,

being indifferent to thy gain abroad, or thy safety at home: If thou art out of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with thy Prince, secure the favour of the KING of Kings, and then there is no harm come to thee: and when <hi>Zeno Citiensis</hi> lost all his goods in a storm, he retired to the studies of Philosophy, to his short cloak, and a severe life, and gave thanks to fortune for his prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous mischance. When the North-winde blows hard, and it rains sadly, none but fools sit down in it and cry,: wise people defend themselves against it with a warm garment, or a good fire, and a dry roof: when a storm of a sad mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance beats upon our spirits, turn it into some advantage by observing where it can serve an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other end, either of religion or prudence, of more safety or lesse envy: it will turn into something that is good, if we list to make it so: at least it may make us weary of the worlds vanity, and take off our confidence from uncertain riches, and make our spirits to dwell in those regions, where content dwells essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially: if it does any good to our souls, it hath made more then sufficient recompence for all the temporal affliction. He that threw a stone at a dog, and hit his cruel stepmother, said, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he intended it otherwise, yet the stone was not quite lost: and if we fail in the first designe, if we bring it home to another equally to content us, or more to profit us, then we have put our conditions past the power of chance; and this was called in the old Greek Comedy <hi>a being reveng'd on fortune by becoming Philosophers</hi> and turning the chance into reason or religion: for so a wise man shall overrule his stars, and have a greater influence upon his own content, then all the constellations and planets of the firmament.</p>

Never compare thy condition with those above thee; but to secure thy content look upon those thousands with whom thou would<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est not for any interest change thy fortune and condition. A souldier must not think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self unprosperous, if he be not successeful as the son of <hi>Philip,</hi> or cannot grasp a fortune as big as the Roman Empire: Be content that thou art not lessened as was <hi>Pyrrhus</hi>: or if thou beest, that thou art not routed like <hi>Crassus</hi>: and when that comes to thee, it is a great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity, that thou art not cag'd and made a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctale like <hi>Bajazet</hi>: or thy eyes were not pull'd out like <hi>Zedekiahs</hi>: or that thou wert not flead alive like <hi>Valentinian.</hi> If thou admirest the greatnesse of <hi>Xerxes,</hi> look also on those that digged the mountain <hi>Atho,</hi> or whose ears and noses were cut off, because the Hellespont car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away the bridge. It is a fine thing (thou thinkest) to be carried on mens shoulders: but give God thanks that thou art not forced to carry a rich fool upon thy shoulders: as those poor men do whom thou beholdest. There are but a few Kings in mankinde, but many thousands who are very miserable, if compared to thee. However it is a huge folly rather to grieve for the good of others, then to rejoyce for that good which God hath given us of our own.</p>
                     <p>And yet there is no wise or good man that would change persons or conditions intirely with any man in the world. It may be he would have one mans wealth added to himself, or the power of a second, or the learning of a third, but still he would receive these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his own person, because he loves that best, and therefore esteems it best, and therefore
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:115792:83"/>
overvalues all that which he is, before all that which any other man in the world can be. Would any man be <hi>Dives</hi> to have his wealth, or <hi>Iudas</hi> for his office, or <hi>Saul</hi> for his kingdom, or <hi>Absalom</hi> for his beauty, <hi>or Achitophel</hi> for his policy? It is likely he would wish all these, and yet he would be the same person still. For every man hath desires of his own, and objects just fitted to them, without which he cannot be, unlesse he were not himself. And let every man that loves himself so well as to love himself before all the world, consider, if he have not something for which, in the whole he values himself far more then he can value any man else. There is therefore no reason to take the finest feathers from all the winged nation to deck that bird, that thinks already she is more valuable then any the inhabitants of the ayre. Either change all or none. Cease to love your self best, or be content with that portion of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and blessing for which you love your self so well.</p>

It conduces much to our content, if we passe by those things which happen to our trouble, and <hi>consider that which is pleasing and prosperous,</hi> that by the represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the better the worse may be blotted out: and at the worst you have enough to keep you alive, and to keep up, and to improve your hopes of Heaven. If I be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown in my suit at Law, yet my house is left me still and my land: or I have a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous wife, or hopeful children, or kinde friends, or good hopes: If I have lost one childe, It may be I have two or three still left me; <hi>or else reckon the blessings which

Now then, when a sadnesse lies heavy upon thee, remember that thou art a Christian designed to the inheritance of Jesus: and what dost thou think concerning thy great fortune, thy lot and portion of eternity?

Indeed if thou thinkest thou shalt perish, I cannot blame thee to be sad, sad till thy heart-strings crack: but then why art thou troubled at the losse of thy money? what should a damned man do with money, which in so great a sadnes it is impossible for him to enjoy?

But if it chance to be ill to day do not increase it by the care of to morrow.

He therefore that enjoyes the present, if it be good, enjoyes as much as is possible: and if onely that dayes trouble leans upon him, it is singular and finite. <hi>Sufficient to the day</hi> (said Christ) <hi>is the evil thereof. Sufficient,</hi> but <hi>not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable</hi>: but if we look abroad and bring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one dayes thoughts the evil of many, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and uncertain, what will be, and what will never be, our load will be as intolerable as it is unreasonable. To reprove this instrument of discontent, the Ancients fained that in Hell stood a man twisting a rope of Hay, and still he twisted on suffering an Asse to eat up all that was finished: so miserable is he who thrusts his passions forward towards future e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents, and suffers all that he may enjoy to be lost and devour d by folly and inconsideration, thinking nothing fit to be enjoyed but that which is not, or cannot be had. Just so, many young persons are loath to dye, and therefore desire to live to old age, and when they are come thither, are troubled that they are come to that state of life to which before they were come, they were hugely afraid they should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Let us prepare our mindes against chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, alwayes expecting them, that we be not surprized when they come: For nothing is so great an enemy to tranquillity and a contented spirit, as the amazement and confusions of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readinesse and inconsideration: and when our fortunes are violently chang'd, our spirits are unchang'd, if they alwayes stood, in the Suburbs and expectation of sorrowes. <hi>O Death, how bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter art thou to a man that is at rest in his possessions:</hi> and to the Rich Man who had promised to himself ease and fulnesse for many years, it was
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:115792:86"/>
a sad arrest that his soul was surprized the first night: but the Apostles who every day knockt at the gate of death, and looked upon it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, went to their Martyrdom in peace and evennesse.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Let us often frame to our selves &amp; repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to our considerations the images of those blessings we have, just as we usually under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand them when we want them. Consider how desirable health is to a sick man, or liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to a prisoner; and if but a fit of the tooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach seizes us with violence, all those troubles which in our health afflicted us, disband in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly and seem inconsiderable. He that in his health is troubled that he is in debt, and spends sleeplesse nights, and refuses meat because of his infelicity, let him fall into a fit of the Stone or a high Feaver, despises the arrest of all his first troubles, and is as a man unconcerned. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member then that God hath given thee a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, the want of which is infinitely more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble then thy present debt, or poverty or losse; and therefore is now more to be valued in the possession, and ought to out-weigh thy trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The very privative blessings, the blessings of immunity, safeguard, liberty and integrity which we commonly enjoy, deserve the thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving of a whole life. If God should send a Cancer upon thy face, or a Wolfe into thy side, if he should spread a crust of Leprosie upon thy skin, what wouldst thou give to be but as now thou art? Wouldest thou not on that condition be as poor as I am? or as the meanest of thy brethren? Would you not choose your present losse or affliction as a thing extremely eligible, and a redemption to thee if thou mightest exchange the other for this?
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:115792:87"/>
Thou art quit from a thousand calamities, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of which if it were upon thee would make thee insensible of thy present sorrow: and therefore let thy joy (which should be as great for thy freedom from them, as is thy sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse when thou feelest any of them) do the same cure upon thy discontent. For if we be not extremely foolish or vain, thanklesse or sencelesse, a great joy is more apt to cure sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and discontent, then a great trouble is. I have known an affectionate wife when she hath been in fear of parting with her beloved Husband, heartily desire of God his life or so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety upon any conditions that were not sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; and choose to beg with him, rather then to feast without him: and the same person hath upon that consideration born poverty nobly, when God hath heard her prayer in the other matter: What wise man in the world is there who does not prefer a small fortune with peace before a great one with contention, and war and violence? and then he is no longer wise if he alters his opinion when he hath his wish.</p>

                        <hi>Sempronius</hi> complained of want of clothes, and was much troubled for a new suit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ashamed to appear in the Theatre with his Gown a little thread-bare: but when he got it and gave his old clothes to <hi>Codrus,</hi> the poor man was ravisht with joy, and went and gave God thanks for his new purchase:
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:115792:88"/>
and <hi>Codrus</hi> was made richly fine and cheerfully warm by that which <hi>Sempronius</hi> was asham'd to wear; and yet their natural needs were both alike, the difference onely was, that <hi>Sempronius</hi> had some artificial and phantastical necessities superinduced, which <hi>Codrus</hi> had not; and was harder to be reliev'd, and could not have joy at so cheap a rate; because the one liv'd ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Nature, the other by Pride and ill customes, and measures taken by other mens eyes and tongues, and artificial needs. He that propounds to his fancy things greater then himself, or his needs, and is discontent and troubled when he fails of such purchases, ought not to accuse Providence, or blame his fortune but his folly. God and Nature made no more needs then they mean to satisfie: and he that will make more must look for satisfaction where he can.</p>

Almost all the ages of the world have noted that their most eminent Scholers were most eminently poor, some by choice, but most by chance, and an inevitable decree of providence: And in the whole sex of women God hath decreed the sharpest pains of childebirth, to show that there is no state exempt from sorrow, and yet that the weakest, persons have strengths more then enough to bear the greatest evil: and the greatest Queens and the Mothers of Saints and Apostles, have no charter of exemption from this sad sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. But the Lord of men and Angels was also the King of sufferings; and if thy course robe trouble thee, remember the swadling clothes of Jesus: if thy bed be uneasy, yet it is not worse than his Manger; and it is no sadnesse to have a thin table, if thou callest to minde that the King of heaven and earth was fed with a little breast milk; and yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides this he suffered all the sorrows which we deserved. We therefore have great reason to sit down upon our own hearths, and warme our selves at our own fires, and feed upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent at home: for it were a strange pride to expect to be more gently treated by the Divine providence then the best and wisest men, then Apostles and Saints, nay, then the son of the Eternal God, the heir of both the worlds.</p>

                     <p n="4">4. Consider that sad accidents and a state of affliction is a School of vertue: it reduces our spirits to sobernesse, and our counsels to moderation; it corrects levity, and interrupts the confidence of sinning. <hi>It is good for me</hi> (said <hi>David) that I have been afflicted,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">119. <hi>Psalm.</hi> 10. <hi>part. v.</hi> 3.</note> 
                        <hi>for thereby I have learned thy Law.</hi> And <hi>I know (O Lord) that thou of very faithfulnesse hast caused me to be troubled.</hi> For God, who in mercy and wisdom governs the world, would never have suffered so many sadnesses, and have sent them especially to the most vertuous and the wisest men, but that he intends they should be the seminary of comfort, the nursery of vertue, the exercise of wisdom, the tryal of patience, the venturing for a crown, and the gate of glory.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Consider that afflictions are oftentimes the occasions of great temporal advantages: and we must not look upon them as they sit down heavily upon us, but as they serve some of Gods ends, and the purposes of universal Providence: And when a Prince fights justly, and yet unprosperously, if he could see all those reasons for which God hath so ordered it, he would think it the most rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable thing in the world, and that it would be very ill to have it otherwise. If a man could
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:115792:92"/>
have opened one of the pages of the Divine counsel, and could have seen the event of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephs</hi> being sold to the Merchants of Amalek, he might with much reason have dried up the young mans tears: and when Gods purposes are opened in the events of things, as it was in the case of <hi>Ioseph,</hi> when he sustained his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers family and became Lord of Egypt, then we see what ill judgement we made of things, and that we were passionate as chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and transported with sence and mistaken interest. The case of <hi>Themistocles</hi> was almost like that of <hi>Ioseph,</hi> for being banished into Egypt, he also grew in favour with the King, and told his wife, <hi>He had been undone, unlesse he had been undone.</hi> For God esteems it one of his glories that he brings good out of evil, and therfore it were but reason we should trust God to govern his own world as he pleases: and that we should patiently <hi>wait till the change cometh,</hi> or the reason be discovered.</p>
                     <p>And this consideration is also of great use to them who envy at the prosperity of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and the successe of Persecutors, and the baits of fishes, and the bread of dogs. God fails not to sow blessings in the long furrows which the plowers plow upon the back of the Church: and this successe which troubles us will be a great glory to God, and a great bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to his Saints and servants, and a great ruine to the Persecutors, who shall have but the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of <hi>Theramenes</hi> one of the thirty Tyrants of Athens, who scap'd when his house fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and was shortly after put to death with torments by his Collegues in the Tyranny.</p>
                     <p>To which also may be added that the great evils w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> happen to the best and wisest men are
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:115792:92"/>
one of the great arguments, upon the strength of which we can expect felicity to our souls, and the joyes of another world. And certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they are then very tolerable and eligible, when with so great advantages they minister to the faith and hope of a Christian. But if we consider what unspeakable tortures are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for the wicked to all eternity, we should not be troubled to see them prosperous here, but rather wonder that their portion in this life is not bigger, and that ever they should be sick, or crossed, or affronted, or troubled with the contradiction and disease of their own vices, since if they were fortunate beyond their own ambition it could not make them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence for one houres torment in Hell, which yet they shall have for their eternall portion.</p>
                     <p>After all these considerations deriving from sence and experience, grace and reason, there are two remedies still remaining, and they are <hi>Necessity</hi> and <hi>Time.</hi>
                     </p>

                     <p>Now besides what hath been already noted, in the state of poverty there is nothing to be accounted for, but <hi>the fear of wanting neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries,</hi> of which if a man could be secured, that he might live free from care, all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of it might be reckoned amongst the advantages of wise and sober persons, rather then objections against that state of fortune.</p>
                     <p>But concerning this I consider, that there must needs be great security to all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, since CHRIST not onely made ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse promises that we should have suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for this life; but also took great pains and used many arguments to create confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in us: and such they were which by their own strength were sufficient, though you abate the authority of the Speaker. The Sonne of GOD told us, his Father takes care of us: Hee that knew all his Fathers counsels and his whole kindnesse towards mankinde, told us so. How great is that truth, how certain, how necessary, which CHRIST himself proved by arguments. The excellent words and most comfortable sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences which are our Bills of Exchange, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the credit of which we lay our cares down, and receive provisions for our need, are these.

                     <p>But some men are highly tempted, and are brought to a strait, that without a miracle they cannot be relieved, what shall they do? It may be their pride or vanity hath brought the necessity upon them, and it is not a need of Gods making; and if it be not they must cure it themselves by lessening their desires, and moderating their appetites; and yet if it be innocent though unnecessary, God does usually relieve such necessities; and he does not onely upon our prayers grant us more then he promised of temporal things: but also he gives many times more then we ask. This is no object for our faith, but ground enough for a temporal and prudent hope: and if we fail in the particular, God will turn it to a big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger mercy, if we submit to his dispensation, and adore him in the denyal. But if it be a matter of necessity, let not any man by way of impatience cry out, that God will not work a miracle; for God by miracle did give meat and drink to his people in the wilderness, of which he had made no particular promise in any Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant: and if all natural means fail, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:115792:97"/>
that God will rather work a miracle then break his word: He can do that, He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do this. Onely we must remember that our portion of temporal things is but <hi>food and raiment</hi>: God hath not promised us coaches and horses, rich houses and jewels, Tyrian silks and Persian carpets; neither hath he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to minister to our needs in such circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances as we shall appoint, but such as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self shall choose. God will enable either thee to pay thy debt (if thou beggest it of him) or else he will pay it for thee, that is, take thy desire as a discharge of thy duty, and pay it to thy Creditor in blessings, or in some secret of his providence. It may be he hath laid up the corn that shall feed thee, in the granary of thy Brother; or will clothe thee with his wool; he enabled Saint <hi>Peter</hi> to pay his Gabel, by the ministery of a fish; and <hi>Elias</hi> to be waited on by a crow, who was both his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister, and his steward for provisions: and his Holy Son rode in triumph upon an asse that grazed in another mans pastures. And if God gives to him the dominion and reserves the use to thee, thou hast the better half of the two; but the charitable man serves God and serves thy need; and both joyn to provide for thee, and God blesses both. But if he takes away the flesh-pots from thee, he can also alter the appetite, and he hath given thee power and commandment to restrain it: and if he lessens the revenue, he will also shrink the necessity; or if he gives but a very little, he will make it go a great way: or if he sends thee but course diet, he will blesse it and make it healthful, and can cure all the anguish of thy povertie by giving

thee patience, and the grace of contented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.

                     <p n="1">1. We must obey all humane laws appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and constituted by lawful Authority, that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                     <p n="2">2. In obedience to humane laws we must ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the letter of the Law where we can with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doing violence to the reason of the Law, and the intention of the Law-giver: but where they crosse each other, the charity of the Law is to be preferred before its discipline, and the reason of it before the letter.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. If the general reason of the Law ceases in our particular, and a contrary reason rises upon us, we are to procure dispensation, or leave to omit the observation of it in such cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances; if there be any persons or office appointed for granting it: but if there be none, or if it is not easily to be had, or not without an inconvenience greater then the good of the observation of the Law in our particular, we are dispensed withall in the nature of the thing, without further processe or trouble.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. As long as the Law is obligatory, so long our obedience is due; and he that begins a contrary c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>stom without reason, sins: but he that breaks the law when the custom is entred and fixed, is excused, because it is suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, the legislative power consents, when by not punishing, it suffers disobedience to grow up to a custome.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Obedience to humane laws must be <hi>for conscience sake</hi>: that is, because in such obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence publick order, and charity, and benefit is concerned: and because the Law of God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:115792:107"/>
us, therefore we must make a consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in keeping the just Laws of Superiors: and although the matter before the making of the Law was indifferent,<note place="margin">
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist. eth.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 7.</note> yet now the obedience is not indifferent, but next to the Laws of God, we are to obey the Laws of all our Superiours, who the more publick they are, the first they are to be in the order of obedience.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Submit to the punishment and censure of the Laws, and seek not to reverse their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by opposing, but by submitting, or flying, or silence to passe thorow it, or by it as we can: and although from inferiour Jugdes we may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal where the Law permits us, yet we must sit down and rest in the judgement of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme: and if we be wronged, let us com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain to God of the injury, not of the persons, and he will deliver thy soul from unrighteous Judges.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Do not believe thou hast kept the Law, when thou hast suffered the punishment. For although patiently to submit to the power of the sword, be a part of obedience, yet this is such a part as supposes another lest undone: and the Law punishes, not because she is as well pleased in taking vengeance, as in being obeyed, but because she is displeased, she uses punishment as a means to secure obedience for the future, or in others. Therefore although in such cases the Law is satisfied, and the injury, and the injustice is paid for, yet the sins of ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religion, and scandal, and disobedience to God must still be so accounted sor, as to crave par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and be washed off by repentance.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Humane Laws are not to be broken with scandal, nor at all without reason; for he that
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:115792:107"/>
does it causelesly is a despiser of the Law, and undervalues the Authority. For humane Laws differ from divine Laws principally in this: 1. That the <hi>positive commands of a man</hi> may be broken upon smaller, and more reasons then <hi>the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                           </gap>ands of God</hi>: we may upon a smaller reason omit to keep any of the fasting dayes of the Church, then omit to give alms to the poor: onely this, the reason must bear weight according to the gravity and concernment of the Law; a Law in a small matter may be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted for a small reason, in a great matter not without a greater reason. And 2. <hi>The negative precepts</hi> of men may cease by many instruments, by contrary customs, by publick disrelish, by long omission: but <hi>the negative precepts</hi> of God never can cease, but when they are expressely abrogated by the same Authority. But what those reasons are that can dispence with the command of a man, a man may be his own Judge, and sometimes take his proportions from his own reason and necessity, sometimes from publick fame, and the practise of pious and severe persons, and from popular customs, in which a man shall walk most safely, when he does not walk alone, but a spiritual man takes him by the hand.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. We must not be too forward in procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring dispensations: nor use them any longer then the reason continues for which we first procured them: for to be dispensed withall is an argument of natural infirmity, if it be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary; but if be not, it signifies an indiscipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and unmortified spirit.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. We must not be too busie in examining the prudence and unreasonablenesse of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Laws: for although we are not bound

to believe them all to be the wisest, yet if by enquiring into the lawfulne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="11">11. Pay that reverence to the person of thy Prince, of his Ministers, of thy Parents and spiritual Guides, which by the customs of the place thou livest in are usually paid to such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in their several degrees: that is, that the highest reverence be paid to the highest per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and so still in proportion: and that this reverence be expressed in all the circumstances and manners of the city and nation.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. Lift not up thy hand against thy Prince or Parent upon what pretence soever: but bear all personal affronts and inconveniences at their hands, and seek no remedy but by patience, and piety, yielding and praying, or absenting thy self.</p>
                     <p n="13">13 <hi>Speak not evil of the Ruler of thy people,</hi> neither <hi>Curse thy Father or Mother,</hi> nor revile thy spiritual Guides, nor discover and lay na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked their infirmities: but treat them with reverence and religion, and preserve their Authority sacred by esteeming their persons venerable.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. Pay tribute and customes to Princes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Laws: and maintenance to thy Parents according to their necessity: and honourable support to the Clergy according to the dignity of the work, and the customs of the place.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. Remember alwayes that duty to our Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:115792:108"/>
is not an act of commutative justice, but of distributive: That is, although Kings and Parents and spiritual Guides are to pay a great duty to their Inferiours, the duty of their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral charges and government: yet the good go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vovernment of a King and of Parents are acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Religion</hi> as they relate to God, &amp; of <hi>Piety</hi> as they relate to their people and families. And although we usually call them <hi>just Princes</hi> who administer their Laws exactly to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, because the actions are in the matter of <hi>justice,</hi> yet in propriety of speech, they are rather to be called <hi>Pious,</hi> and <hi>Religious.</hi> For as he is not called a <hi>just Father</hi> that educates his children well, but <hi>pious</hi>; so that Prince who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends and well rules his people, is <hi>Religious,</hi> and does that duty for which alone he is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to God. The consequence of which is this, so far as concerns our duty: If the Prince or Parent fail of their duty, we must not fail of ours: for we are answerable to them and to God too; as being accountable to all our Superiours, and so are they to theirs: they are above us, and God is above them.</p>

                     <head>Remedies against disobedience: and means to endear our obedience, by way of consideration.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. Consider that all authority descends from God, and our Superiours bear the image of the Divine Power, which God imprints on them as on an image of clay, or a coin upon a lesse perfect mettal, which who so defaces, shall not be answerable for the losse or spoil of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials, but the effacing the Kings Image, and in the same measure will God require it at our hands, if we despise his authority upon whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:115792:109"/>
he hath imprinted it. <hi>He that despiseth you, despiseth me.</hi> And <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> were said to be <hi>gathered together against the Lord.</hi> And this was <hi>S. Pauls</hi> argument for our obedience. [<hi>The powers that be, are ordained of God.</hi>]</p>
                     <p n="2">2. There is very great peace and immunity from sin in resigning our wils up to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of others: for provided that our duty to God be secured, their commands are warrants to us in all things else; and the case of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science is determined, if the command be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and pressing: and it is certain, the action that is but indifferent, and without reward, if done onely upon our own choice, is an act of duty and of religion, and rewardable by the grace and favour of God, if done in obedience to the command of our Superiours. For since naturally we desire what is forbidden us, and (sometimes there is no other evil in the thing, but that it is forbidden us) God hath in grace enjoyned and proportionably accepts obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence as being directly opposed to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer irregularity, and it is acceptable, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there be no other good in the thing that is commanded us, but that it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. By obedience we are made a society and a republick, and distinguished from herds of Beasts, and heaps of Flyes, who do what they list, and are incapable of Laws, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey none, and therefore are killed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, though never punished, and they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver can have a reward.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. By obedience we are rendred capable of all the blessings of government, signified by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in these words [<hi>He is the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of God to thee for good,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">

in these [<hi>Governours are sent by him for the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of evill doers,</hi>

                        <hi>and for the praise of them that do well.</hi>] And he that ever felt, or saw, or can understand the miseries of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion in publick affaires, or amazement in a heap of sad, tumultuous, and indefinite thoughts, may from thence judge of the admirable effects of order, and the beauty of Government. What health is to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and peace is to the Spirit, that is Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the societies of Men, the greatest bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing which they can receive in that temporal capacity.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. No Man shall ever be fit to govern others that knows not first how to obey. For if the spirit of a Subject be rebellious, in a Prince it will be tyrannical and intolerable, and of so ill example, that as it will encourage the disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of others, so it will render it unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable for him to exact of others, what in the like case he refused to pay.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. There is no sin in the World which God hath punisht with so great severity and high detestation as this of disobedience. For the crime of Idolatry God sent the Sword amongst his people, but it was never heard that the Earth opened and swallowed up any but Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels against their Prince<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <p n="7">7.

                     <head>Degrees of Obedience.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. The first is <hi>the obedience of the outward work</hi>: and this is all that Humane Lawes of themselves regard; for because Man cannot judge the heart, therefore it prescribes nothing to it: the publick end is served not by good wishes, but by real and actual performances; and if a Man obeyes against his will he is not punishable by the Laws.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 <hi>The obedience of the will,</hi> and this is also necessary in our obedience to Humane Lawes, not because man requires it for himself, but because God commands it towards Man; and of it (although Man cannot, yet) God will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand account. For we are to do it <hi>as to the Lord and not to men</hi>; and therefore we must do it wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly. But by this means our obedience in private is secur'd against secret arts and subter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuges; and when we can avoid the punishment, yet we shall not decline our duty, but serve Man for Gods sake, that is, <hi>cheerfully, promptly, vigorously,</hi> for these are the proper parts of wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingnesse and choice.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The <hi>understanding must yeeld obedience in general,</hi> though not in the particular instance; that is, we must be firmly perswaded of the excellency of the obedience, though we be not bound in all cases to think the particular Law to be most prudent. But in this, our rule is plain enough. Our understanding ought to be
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:115792:111"/>
inquisitive whether the civil constitution agree with our duty to God; but we are bound to inquire no further; And therefore beyond this, although he, who having no obligation to it (as Counsellours have) inquires not at all into the wisdome or reasonablenesse of the Law, be not alwayes the wisest Man, yet he is ever the best Subject. For when he hath given up his understanding to his Prince and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, provided that his duty to God be secured by a precedent search, hath also with the best, and with all the instruments in the World se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured his obedience to Man.</p>

Princes of the people and all that have Legislative power must provide useful and good Lawes for the defence of propriety, for the encouragement of labour, for the safeguard of their persons, for determining controversies, for reward of noble actions, and excellent arts and rare inventions, for promoting trade, and enriching their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>

In the making Lawes Princes must have regard to the publick dispositions, to the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and disaffections of the people; and must not introduce a Law with publick scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal and displeasure: but consider the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick benefit, and the present capacity of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs and general inclinations of mens mindes. For he that enforces a Law upon a people against their first and publick apprehensions tempts them to disobedience, and makes Lawes to become snares and hooks to catch the people, and to enrich the treasury with the spoil and tears and curses of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munalty, and to multiply their mutiny and their sin.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Princes must provide that the Lawes be duely executed: for a good Law without execution is like an unperformed promise: and therefore they must be severe exactors

of accounts from their Delegates and Ministers of Justice.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The severity of Lawes must be temper'd with dispensations, pardons, and remissions ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the case shall alter, and new necessities be introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,<note place="margin">

                     <p n="5">5. Princes must be Fathers of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and provide such instances of gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, ease, wealth, and advantages, as may make mutuall confidence betweene them; and must fix their security under GOD in the love of the people, which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they must with all arts of sweetnesse, remission, popularity, noblenesse and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity endeavour to secure to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>

                     <p n="12">12. All Princes must esteem themselves as <hi>much bound</hi> by their word, by their grants, &amp; by their promises, as the meanest of their Subjects are by the restraint and penalty of Laws: and although they are superiour to the people, yet they are not superiour to their own voluntary concessions; and ingagements, their promises and Oathes, when once they are passed from them.</p>

of the poor. For although the poor must fare no worse for his poverty, yet in ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice he must fare no better for it: And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the rich must be no more regarded, yet he must not be lesse. And to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the Tutor of <hi>Cyrus</hi> instructed him, when in a controversie where a great Boy would have taken a large coat from a little Boy because his own was too little for him, and the others was too big, hee adjudged the great coat to the great Boy: his Tutor an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, Sir, If you were made a Judge of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency or fitnesse, you had judged well in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the biggest to the biggest: but when you were appointed Judge, not whom the coat did fit, but whose it was, you should have considered the title, and the possession, who did the violence, and who made it, or who bought it?

                     <p n="2">2.

In prices of bargaining concerning un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain Merchandizes you may buy as cheap ordinarily as you can, and sell as dear as you can, so it be 1. without violence, and 2. when you contract on equal terms, with persons in all senses (as to the matter and skill of bargain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) equal to your self, that is, Merchants with Merchants, wise men with wise men, rich with rich: and 3. when there is no deceit, and no necessity, and no Monopoly: For in these cases, <hi>viz.</hi> when the Contractors are equal, and no advantage on either side, both parties are voluntary, and therefore there can be no injustice or wrong to either. But then adde also this consideration, that the publick bee not oppressed by unreasonable and unjust rates: for which the following rules are the best measure.</p>

this case is, because he that intreats or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swades to a sin is as guilty as he that acts it: and if without his perswasion the sin and the injury would not be acted, he is in his kinde the intire cause, and therefore obliged to repair the injury as much as the person that does the wrong immediately.</p>

                     </note> but humbly to submit, ever remembring that there are some things which our understanding cannot fathom nor search out their depth.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To believe nothing concerning God but what is honourable and excellent, as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that belief to be no honoring of God which entertains of him any dishonourable thoughts. Faith is the parent of Charity, and whatsoever Faith entertains must be apt to produce love to God: but he that believes God to be cruel or unmerciful, or a rejoycer in the una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable damnation of the greatest part of mankinde, or that he speaks one thing and privately means another; thinks evil thoughts concerning God, and such, as for which we should hate a man, and therefore are great enemies of Faith, being apt to destroy charity. Our Faith concerning God must be as himself hath revealed and described his own excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies: and in our discourses we must remove from him all imperfection, and attribute to him all excellency.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To give our selves wholly up to Christ in heart and desire to become Disciples of his
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:115792:130"/>
doctrine with choice (besides conviction) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the presence of God, but as Ideots, that is, without any principles of our own to hinder the truth of God; but sucking in greedily all that God hath taught us, believing it infinitely, and loving to believe it. For this is an act of Love reflected upon Faith, or an act of Faith leaning upon Love.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. To believe all Gods promises, and that whatsoever is promised in Scripture shall on Gods part be as surely performed as if we had it in possession. This act makes us to rely upon God with the same confidence as we did on our Parents when we were children, when we made no doubt, but whatsoever we needed we should have it if it were in their power.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. To believe also the conditions of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, or that part of the revelation which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns our duty. Many are apt to believe the Article of remission of sins, but they believe it without the condition of repentance, or the fruits of holy life: and that is to believe the Article otherwise then God intended it. For the Covenant of the Gospel is the great object of Faith, and that supposes our duty to answer his grace; that God will be our God, so long, as we are his people; The other is not Faith but Flattery.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. To professe publickly the doctrine of Jesus Christ, openly owning whatsoever he hath revealed and commanded, not being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed of the word of God, or of any practises enjoyned by it; and this, without complying with any mans interest, not regarding favor, nor being moved with good words, not fearing dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, or losse, or inconvenience, or death it self.</p>

                     <pb n="231" facs="tcp:115792:130"/>7.

                  <p>These acts of Faith are in several degrees in the servants of Jesus: some have it but as a grain of mustard-seed, some grow up to a plant, some have the fulnesse of faith: but the least faith that is must be a perswasion so strong as to make us undertake the doing of all that duty which Christ built upon the foundation of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving: but we shall best discern the truth of our faith by these following signes.<note place="margin">

But he that rejoyces in gain, and his heart dwells in the world, and is espoused to a fair estate, and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with a light momentany joy, and is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with losses, and amazed with temporal persecutions, and esteems disgrace, or poverty in a good cause to be intolerable, this man either hath no inheritance in Heaven, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves none; and believes not that he is adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be the Son of God, the Heir of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Glory.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. S. <hi>Iames</hi>'s signe is the best: [<hi>Shew me thy faith by thy works</hi>] Faith makes the Merchant di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent and venturous, and that makes him rich. <hi>Ferdinando</hi> of Arragon believed the story told him by <hi>Columbus,</hi> and therefore he furnished him with ships, and got the west Indies by his Faith in the undertaker. But <hi>Henry</hi> the seventh of <hi>England</hi> believed him not, and therefore trusted him not with shipping, and lost all the purchase of that Faith. It is told us by Christ [<hi>He that forgives shall be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given</hi>] if we believe this, it is certain we shall forgive our enemies; for none of us all but need and desire to be forgiven. No man can possibly despise or refuse to desire such
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:115792:131"/>
excellent glories as are revealed to them that that are servants of Christ: and yet we do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is commanded us as a condition to obtain them. No man could work a dayes labor without faith: but because he believes he shall have his wages at the dayes or weeks end, he does his duty. But he onely believes who does that thing which other men in the like cases do, when they do believe. He that believes, money gotten with danger is better then po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty with safety, will venture for it in unknown lands or seas: and so will he that believes it better to get Heaven with labour, then to go to Hell with pleasure.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. <hi>He that believes does not make haste,</hi> but waits patiently till the times of refreshment come, and dares trust God for the morrow, and is no more sollicitous for next year, then he is for that which is past: and it is certain, that man wants faith who dares be more confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of being supplied when he hath money in his purse, then when he hath it onely in bills of exchange from God: or that relyes more upon his own industry then upon Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, when his own industry fails him. If you dare trust to God when the case to humane reason seems impossible, and trust to God then also out of choice, not because you have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else to trust to, but because he is the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly support of a just confidence, then you give a good testimony of your faith.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. True Faith is confident, and will ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture all the world upon the strength of its persuasion. Will you lay your life on it, your estate, your reputation, that the doctrine of JESUS CHRIST is true in every Article? Then you have true Faith. But he that fears men
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:115792:132"/>
more then God, believes men more then he believes in God.</p>
                     <p n="8">8.

                     </note>FAith differs from Hope in the extension of its object, and in the intension of degree. Saint <hi>Austin</hi> thus accounts their differences. Faith is of all things revealed, good and bad, rewards and punishments, of things past, present, and to come, of things that concern us, and of things that concern us not: But Hope hath for its Object things onely that are good and fit to be hoped for, future, and concerning our selves: and because these things are offered to us upon conditions of which we may so fail as we may change our will; therefore our certainty is lesse then the adherences of faith; which (because Faith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyes onely upon one proposition, that is, the truth of the Word of God) cannot be made uncertain in themselves, though the object of our Hope may become uncertain to us, and to our possession: for it is infallibly certain,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:115792:133"/>
that there is Heaven for all the godly, and for me amongst them all, if I do my duty. But that I shall enter into Heaven is the object of my Hope, not of my Faith, and is so sure, as it is certain I shall persevere in the wayes of God.</p>
                  <div type="subsection">
                     <head>The Acts of Hope, are</head>
                     <p n="1">1. To relye upon God with a confident ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of his promises; ever esteeming that every promise of God is a magazine of all that grace and relief which we can need in that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance for which the promise is made. <hi>Every degree of hope is a degree of confidence.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. To esteem all the danger of an action and the possibilities of miscarriage, and every crosse accident that can intervene, to be no defect on Gods part, but either a mercy on his part, or a fault on ours: for then we shall be sure to trust in God when we see him to be our confidence, and our selves the cause of all mischances. <hi>The hope of a Christian is prudent and religious.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. To rejoyce in the midst of a misfortune or seeming sadnesse, knowing that this may work for good, and will, if we be not wanting to our souls. This is a direct act of Hope to look through the cloud, and look for a beam of light from God, and this is called in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Rejoycing in tribulation,</hi> when <hi>the God of hope fils us with all joy in believing. Every degree of hope brings a degree of joy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. To desire, to pray, and to long for the great object of our hope, the mighty price of our high calling; and to desire the other things of this life, as they are promised, that is, so far as they are made necessary and useful to us
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:115792:134"/>
in order to Gods glory, and the great end of fouls. <hi>Hope</hi> and <hi>Fasting</hi> are said to be the two wings of <hi>Prayer.</hi> Fasting is but as the wing of a Bird, but Hope is like the wing of an Angel soaring up to Heaven, and bears our prayers to the throne of Grace. Without Hope it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to pray; but Hope makes our prayers reasonable, passionate, and religious; for it relyes upon Gods promise, or experience, or providence, and story. <hi>Prayer is alwayes in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to our Hope, zealous and affectionate.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. Perseverance is the perfection of the duty of hope, and its last act: and so long as our hope continues, so long we go on in duty and diligence: but he that is to raise a Castle in an hour, sits down &amp; does nothing towards it: and <hi>Herod</hi> the Sophister left off to teach his son, when he saw that 24 Pages appointed to wait on him, and called by the several Letters of the Alphabet could never make him to understand his letters perfectly.</p>

                     <head>Rules to govern our Hope.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Let your Hope be moderate,</hi> proportioned to your state, person and condition, whether it be for gifts or graces, or temporal favours. It is an ambitious hope for a person whose dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence is like them that are least in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven, to believe themselves endea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="239" facs="tcp:115792:134"/>
Hope that God will crown your endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours with equal measures of that reward which he indeed freely gives, but yet gives accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our proportions. Hope for good successe according to, or not much beyond the effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the causes and the instrument, and let the Husbandman hope for a good Harvest, not for a rich Kingdom, or a victorious Army.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Let your hope be well founded,</hi> relying upon just confidences, that is, upon God according to his revelations and promises. For it is possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for a Man to have a vain hope upon God: and in matters of Religion it is presumption to hope that Gods mercies will be powred forth upon lazy persons that do nothing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards holy and strict walking, nothing (I say) but trust, and long for an event besides and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all disposition of the means. Every false principle in Religion is a Reed of <hi>Egypt,</hi> false and dangerous. * Relye not in temporal things upon uncertain prophecies, and Astrology, not upon our own wit or industry, not upon gold or friends, not upon Armies and Princes, expect not health from Physicians that cannot cure their own breath, much lesse their mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality: use all lawful instruments, but expect nothing from them above their natural or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary efficacy, and in the use of them from God expect a blessing.

                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Let your hope be without vanity,</hi> or garish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of spirit, but sober, grave and silent, fixed in the heart, not born upon the lip, apt to support our spirits within, but not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke envy abroad.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Let your hope be of things possible, safe

                     <p n="2">2. Despise the things of the World, and be indifferent to all changes and events of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence; and for the things of God the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses are certain to be performed in kinde; &amp; where there is lesse variety of chance, there
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:115792:135"/>
is lesse possibility of being mocked: but he that creates to himself thousands of little hopes, uncertain in the promise, fallible in the event, and depending upon ten thousand circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces (as are all the things of this World) shall often fail in his expectations, and be used to arguments of distrust in such hopes.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. So long as your hopes are regular and reasonable, though in temporal affairs, such as are deliverance from enemies, escaping a storm or shipwrack, recovery from a sicknesse, ability to pay your debts, &amp;c. remember that there are some things ordinary, and some things extraordinary to prevent despair. <hi>In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary,</hi> Remember that the very hoping in God is an endearment of him, and a means to obtain the blessing [<hi>I will deliv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There are in God all those glorious Attributes and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies which in the nature of things can pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly create or confirm Hope. God is 1. Strong, 2. Wise. 3. True. 4. Loving. There cannot be added another capacity to create a confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; for upon these premises we cannot fail of receiving what is fit for us. 3. God hath oblig'd himself by promise that we shall have the good of every thing we desire: for even losses and denials shall <hi>work for the good of them that fear God.</hi> And if we will trust the truth of God for performance of the general, we may well trust his wisdome to choose for us the particular. * But <hi>the extraordinaries</hi> of God are apt to supply the defect of all natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and humane possibilities. 1. God hath in many instances given extraordinary vertue to the active causes and instruments: to a jaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone to kill a multitude: to 300 Men to destroy
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:115792:136"/>
a great Army, to <hi>Ionathan</hi> and his Armour-bearer to rout a whole Garrison. 2. He hath given excellent sufferance and vigorousnesse to the sufferers, arming them with strange cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, heroical fortitude, invincible resolution, and glorious patience: and thus, he layes no more upon us then we are able to bear: for when he increases our sufferings, he lessens them by increasing our patience. 3. His pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence is extraregular and produces strange things beyond common rules: and he that lead Israel through a Sea, and made a Rock powre forth waters, and the Heavens to give them bread and flesh, and whole Armies to be destroyed with phantastick noises, and the fortune of all <hi>France</hi> to be recovered and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely revolv'd by the arms and conduct of a Girle against the torrent of the <hi>English</hi> fortune and Chivalry; can do what he please, and still retains the same affections to his people, and the same providence over mankinde as ever:<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.18.</note> and it is impossible for that Man to despair, who remembers that <hi>his Helper is Omnipotent,</hi> and can do what he please: let us rest there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while; he can if he please: And he is <hi>infinitely loving</hi>: willing enough; and he is <hi>infinitely wise,</hi> choosing better for us then we can do for our selves. This in all ages and chances hath supported the afflicted people of God and carried them on dry ground through a red Sea. God invites and cherishes the hopes of Men by all the variety of his providence.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. If your case be brought to the last extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and that you are at the pits brink, even the very Margent of the Grave, yet then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair not; at least put it off a little longer: and remember that whatsoever final accident takes
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:115792:136"/>
away all hope from you, if you stay a little longer, and in the mean while bear it sweetly, it will also take away all despair too. For when you enter into the Regions of death, you rest from all your labours and your fears.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Let them who are tempted to despair of their salvation, consider how much Christ suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to redeem<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> us from sin and its eternal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment: and he that considers this, must needs believe, that the desires w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> God had to save us were not lesse then infinite, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not easily to be satisfied without it.</p>

GOD hath preserved mee from many sinnes; his mercies are infinite, I hope he will still preserve me from more, and for ever *. 2. I have sinned and GOD smote me not: his mercies are still over the penitent, I hope he will deliver me from all the evils I have deserved He hath forgiven me many sins of malice, and therefore surely he will pity my

infirmities. * 3. God visited my heart, and chang'd it: he loves the work of his own hands, and so my heart is now become: I hope he will love this too. * 4. When I repented he receiv'd me graciously; and therefore I hope if I do my endeavour he will totally forgive me. 5. He help'd my slow and beginning endeavours, and therefore I hope he will lead me to perfection. * 6. When he had given me something first, then he gave me more. I hope therefore he will keep me from falling, and give me the grace of perseverance. * 7. He hath chosen me to be a Disciple of Christs institution; he hath elected me to his Kingdom of grace, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I hope also, to the Kingdom of his glory. * 8. He died for me when I was his enemy, and therefore I hope he will save me when he hath reconcil'd me to him, &amp; is become my friend. * 9. <hi>God hath given us his Son, how should not he with him give us all things else?</hi> All these S. <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> reduces to these three Heads, as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments of all our hopes. 1.

                  <p>LOve is the greatest thing that God can give us, for himself is love, and it is the greatest thing we can give to God, for it will also give our selves, and carry with it all that is ours. The Apostle cals it the band of perfection; it is <hi>the Old,</hi> and it is <hi>the New,</hi> and it is <hi>the great Commandement,</hi> and it is all the Commandements, for it <hi>is the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Law.</hi> It does the work of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther graces without any instrument but its own immediate vertue. For as the love to sinne makes a Man sinne against all his own
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:115792:138"/>
reason, and all the discourses of wisdom, and all the advices of his friends, and without tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, and without opportunity: so does the love of God, it makes a man chast without the laborious arts of fasting and exteriour disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plines, temperate in the midst of feasts, and is active enough to choose it without any inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medial appetites, and reaches at Glory tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the very heart of Grace, without any other arms but those of Love. It is a grace that loves God for himself, and our Neighbours for God. The consideration of Gods goodnesse and bounty, the experience of those profitable and excellent emanations from him, may be, and most commonly are the first motive of our love: but when we are once entred, and have tasted the goodnesse of God, we love the spring for its own excellency, passing from passion to reason, from thanking to adoring, from sence to spirit, from considering our selves, to an u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God: and this is the image and little representation of Heaven; it is beatitude in picture, or rather the infancy and beginnings of glory.</p>
                  <p>We need no incentives by way of special enumeration to move us to the love of God, for we cannot love any thing for any reason real or imaginary, but that excellency is infinitely more eminent in God. There can but two things create love, <hi>Perfection</hi> and <hi>Vsefulnesse</hi>: to which answer on our part, first <hi>admiration,</hi> and 2. <hi>Desire:</hi> and both these are centred in love. <hi>For the entertainment of the first,</hi> there is in God an infinite nature, immensity or vastnesse with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out extension or limit, Immutability, Eternity, Omnipotence, Omniscience, Holinesse, Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, Providence, Bounty, Mercy, Justice,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:115792:139"/>
Perfection in himself, and the end to which all things and all actions must be directed, and will at last arrive. The consideration of which may be heightened, if we consider our distance from all these glories: Our smallnesse and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited nature, our nothing, our inconstancy, our age like a span, our weaknesse and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, our poverty, our inadvertency, and inconsideration, our disabilities and disaffections to do good, our harsh na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and unmerciful inclinations, our univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal iniquitie, and our necessities dependen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, not onely on God originally, and essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, but even our need of the meanest of Gods creatures, and our being obnoxious to the weakest and the most contemptible. But <hi>for the entertainment of the second</hi> we may consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that in him is a torrent of pleasure for the voluptuous, he is the fountain of honour for the ambitious, an inexhaustible treasure for the covetous: our vices are in love with phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick pleasures and images of perfection, which are truely and really to be found no where but in God. And therefore our vertues have such proper objects, that it is but reasonable they should all turn into love: for certain it is that this love will turn all into vertue.<note place="margin">

                     <p>But because this passion is pure as the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est and smoothest mirrour, and therefore is apt to be sullyed with every impurer breath, we must be careful that our love to God be gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by these measures.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That our love be sweet, even and full of tranquility, having in it no violences or trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portations, but going on in a course of holy acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and duties which are proportionable to our condition, and present state; not to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie all the desire, but all the probabilities and measures of our strength. A new beginner in religion hath passionate and violent desires, but they must not be the measure of his actions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But he must consider his strength, his late sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and state of death, the proper tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his condition, and stand at first upon his defence, not go to storm a strong Fort, or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taque a potent enemy, or do heroical actions and fitter for gyants in Religion. Indiscreet vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:115792:141"/>
and untimely forwardnesse are the rocks of religion against which tender spirits often suffer shipwrack.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Let our love be prudent and without il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion: that is, that it expresse it self in such instances which God hath chosen, or which we choose our selves by proportion to his rules and measures. Love turns into doting when religion turns into Superstition. No degree of love can be imprudent, but the expressions may: we cannot love God too much, but we may proclaim it in undecent manners.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Let our love be firm, constant and insepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, not coming and returning like the tide, but descending like a never failing river, ever running into the Ocean of Divine excellency, passing on in the chanels of duty and a constant obedience, and never ceasing to be what it is, till it comes to be what it desires to be; still being a river till it be turned into sea and vastnesse, even the immensitie of a blessed Eternity.</p>
                     <p>Although the consideration of the Divine excellencies and mercies be infinitely sufficient to produce in us love to God (who is invisible and yet not distant from us, but we feel him in his blessings, he dwells in our hearts by faith, we feed on him in the Sacrament, and are made all one with him in the incarnation and glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of Jesus) yet that we may the better enkindle and encrease our love to God, the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing advices are not uselesse.</p>

they pollute and unhallow the pure &amp; Spiritual love. Every degree of inordinate affection to the things of this world, and every act of love to a sin is a perfect enemy to the love of God: and it is a great shame to take any part of our affection from the eternal God to bestow it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his creature in defiance of the Creator, or to give it to the Devil, our open enemy, in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement of him who is the fountain of all excellencies and Coelestial amities.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Lay fetters and restraints upon the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginative and phantastick part: because our fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie being an imperfect and higher facultie is usually pleased with the entertainment of sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes and gauds; and because the things of the world fill it with such beauties and phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick imagery, the fancy presents such objects as amiable to the affections, and elective powers. Persons of fancy, such as are women and children have alwayes the most violent loves; but therefore if we be careful with what representments we fill our fancy, we may the sooner rectifie our loves. To this purpose, it is good that we transplant the instruments of fancy into religion: and sor this reason musick was brought into Churches, and ornaments, and persumes, and comely garments, and solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and decent ceremonies, that the busie and lesse discerning fancy being bribed with its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per objects may be instrumental to a more coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial and spiritual love.</p>

Remove solicitude or worldly cares, and multitudes of secular businesses; for if these take up the intention and actual ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of our thoughts and our imployments, they will also possesse our passions; which if they be filled with one object though ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:115792:142"/>
cannot attend another though more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent. We alwayes contract a friendship and relation with those with whom we converse: our very Countrey is dear to us for our being in it: and the Neighbours of the same Village, and those that buy and sell with us have seized upon some portions of our love, and therefore if we dwell in the affairs of the World, we shall also grow in love with them; and all our love, or all our hatred, all our hopes, or all our fears, which the eternal God would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly secure to himself, and esteem amongst his treasures and precious things, shall be spent upon trifles and vanities.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Do not onely choose the things of God, but secure your inclinations and aptnesses for God and for Religion. For it will be a hard thing for a Man to do such a personal violence to his first desires, as to choose whatsoever he hath no minde to. A Man will many times sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the importunity and daily solicitations of his first longings: and therefore there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can secure our loves to God, but stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the natural Fountains, and making Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to grow neer the first desires of the soul.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Converse with God by frequent prayer. In particular, desire that your desires may be right, and love to have your affections regular and holy: To which purpose make very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent addresses to God by ejaculations and communions, and an assiduous daily devotion: Discover to him all your wants, complain to him of all your affronts, do as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did, lay your misfortunes and your ill news before him, <hi>spread them before the Lord,</hi> call to him for health, run to him for counsel, beg of him for pardon; and it is as natural to love him to
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:115792:142"/>
whom we make such addresses, and of whom we have such dependancies, as it is for children to love their parents.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Consider the immensity and vastnesse of the Divine love to us, expressed in all the ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of his providence. 1. <hi>In his Creation.</hi> 2. <hi>In his conservation of us.</hi> For it is not my Prince or my Patron, or my Friend that sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports me, or relieves my needs, but God, who made the Corn that my friend sends me, who created the Grapes and supported him, who hath as many dependances, and as many natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral necessities, and as perfect disabilities as my self. God indeed made him the instrument of his providence to me, as he hath made his own Land or his own Cattel to him: with this onely difference, that God by his ministration to me intends to do him a favour and a reward, which to natural instruments he does nor. 3. In giving his Son. 4. In forgiving our sins. 5. In adopting us to glory: and ten thousand times ten thousand little accidents and instances hapning in the doing every of these; and it is not possible but for so great love we should give love again, for <hi>God</hi> we should give <hi>Man,</hi> for felicity we should part with our misery. Nay, so great is the love of the holy Jesus,<note place="margin">

<pb n="256" facs="tcp:115792:143"/>
of love, and those are <hi>Labour of love,</hi> and the <hi>zeal of love</hi>: the first is duty, the second is perfection.</p>

                  <div type="subsection">
                     <head>The two states of love to God.</head>
                     <p>The least love that is, must be <hi>obedient, pure, simple, and communicative</hi>: that is, it must ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all affection to sin, and all inordinate affection to the World; and must be expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive according to our power, in the instances of duty, and must be love for loves sake; and of this love Martyrdom is the highest instance; that is, a readinesse of minde rather to <hi>suffer</hi> any evil then <hi>to do</hi> any. Of this our blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour affirmed, <hi>That no man had greater love then this:</hi> that is, this is the highest point of duty, the greatest love that God requires of Man. And yet he that is the most imperfect must have this love also in preparation of minde, and must differ from another in nothing, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in the degrees of promptnesse and alacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And in this sense, he that loves God truly (though but with a beginning and tender love) yet he loves God with all his heart, that is, with that degree of love which is the highest point of duty, and of Gods charge upon us; and he that loves God with all his heart, may yet increase <hi>with the increase of God,</hi> just as there are degrees of love to God among the Saints, and yet each of them love him with all their powers and capacities.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But the greater state of love is the <hi>zeal of love,</hi> which runs out into excrescencies, and suckers like a fruitful and pleasant tree, or burst<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into gums, and producing fruits, not of a monstrous, but of an extraordinary and heroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal greatnesse. Concerning which, these cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are to be observed.</p>

                     <head>Cautions and rules concerning zeal.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. If zeal be in the beginnings of our spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual birth, or be short <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                           <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.18.</note>, sudden and transient, or be a consequent of a mans natural temper, or come upon any cause, but after a long growth of a temperate and well regulated love, it is to be suspected for passion, and forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, rather then the vertical point of love.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That zeal onely is good which in a fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent love hath temperate expressions. For let the affection boyl as high as it can, yet if it boyl over into irregular and strange actions, it will <hi>have but few,</hi> but <hi>will need many excuses. Elijah</hi> was zealous for the Lord of Hosts, and yet he was so transported with it, that he could not receive answer from God, till by Musick he was recompos d and tam'd: and <hi>Moses</hi> broke both the Tables of the Law by being passionately zealous against them that brake the first.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Zeal must spend its greatest heat princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally in those things that concern our selves; but with great care and restraint in those that concern others.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Remember that zeal being an excres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of Divine love, must in no sense contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict any action of love: Love to God includes love to our Neighbour, and therefore no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of zeal for Gods <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.6.</note> glory must make us uncharitable to our brother, for that is just so pleasing to God, as hatred is an act of love.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. That zeal that concernes others, can spend it self in nothing but arts, and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and charitable instruments for their good: and when it concernes the good of many that one should suffer, it must bee done by persons of a competent authority,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:115792:144"/>
and in great necessity, in seldom instances, according to the Law of God or Man; but never by private right, or for trifling acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, or in mistaken propositions. The Zealots in the Old Law had authority to transfix and stab some certain persons; but GOD gave them warrant; it was in the case of Idolatry, or such notorious huge crimes; the danger of which was insuport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and the cognizance of which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible: And yet that warrant expired with the Synagogue.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Zeal in the instances of our own duty, and personal deportment is more safe then in matters of counsel, and actions besides our just duty, and tending towards perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Though in these instances there is not a direct sin, even where the zeal is lesse wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, yet there is much trouble and some dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: (as, if it be spent in the too forward vowes of Chastity, and restraints of natural and innocent liberties.)</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Zeal may be let loose in the instances of internal, personal, and spiritual actions, that are matters of direct duty: as in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and acts of adoration, and thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and frequent addresses: provided that no indirect act passe upon them to defile them; such as complacency, and opinions of sanctity, censuring others, scruples and opinions of necessity, unnecessary fears, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious numbrings of times and houres; but let the zeal be as forward as it will, as devout as it will, as Seraphicall as it will in the direct addresse and entercourse with God, there is no danger, no transgression.

                     <p n="8">8. Let zeal be seated in the will and choice, and regulated with prudence and a sober un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, not in the fancies and affections;<note place="margin">

                     <p>The summe is this: That, zeal is not a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect duty, no where commanded for it self,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Titus</hi> 2.14. <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.19.</note> and is nothing but a forwardnesse and circumstance of another duty, and therfore is then onely acceptable when it advances the love of God and our Neighbours, whose circumstance it is: That zeal is onely safe, onely acceptable which increases charity directly; and because love to our Neighbour, and obedience to God are the two great portions of charity, we must never account our zeal to be good, but as it advances both these, if it be in a matter that relates to both; or severally, if it relates severally. <hi>S. Pauls</hi> zeal was expressed in preaching with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any offerings or stipend, in travelling, in spending and being spent for his flock, in suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, in being willing to be accursed for love of the people of God, and his Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: Let our zeal be as great as his was, so it be in affections to others, but not at all in angers against them: In the first then is no danger; in the second there is no safety. In brief; let your zeal (if it must be expressed in anger) be alwayes more severe against thy <note n="*" place="margin">2 <hi>Cor</hi> 7.11.</note> self, then against others.</p>

                  <p>REading and Hearing the word of God are but the several circumstances of the same duty; instrumental especially to faith, but consequently to all other graces of the
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:115792:145"/>
Spirit. It is all one to us whether by the eye or by the eare the Spirit conveyes his precepts to us. If we hear S. <hi>Paul</hi> saying to us, that [<hi>Whoremongers and Adulterers God will judge</hi>:] or read it in one of his Epistles; in either of them we are equally and sufficiently instructed. The Scriptures read are the same thing to us, which the same doctrine was, when it was preached by the Disciples of our blessed Lord; and we are to learn of either with the same dispositions. There are many that cannot reade the word, and they must take it in by the ear; and they that can reade, finde the same word of God by the eye. It is necessary that all men learn it some way or other, and it is sufficient in order to their practise that they learn it any way. <hi>The word of God</hi> is all those Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Revelations, those promises and threatnings, the stories and sermons recorded in the Bible: nothing else is <hi>the word of God,</hi> that we know of, by any certain instrument. The good books and spiritual discourses, the sermons or homilies written or spoken by men are but <hi>the word of men,</hi> or rather explications of, and exhortations according to the <hi>Word of God</hi>: but of themselves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they are not the <hi>Word of God.</hi> In a Sermon, the Text onely is in a proper sence to be called <hi>Gods Word</hi>: and yet good Sermons are of great use and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience for the advantages of Religion. He that preaches an hour together against drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse with the tongue of men or Angels, hath spoke no other word of God but this [<hi>Be not drunk with wine wherein there is excesse</hi>:] and he that writes that Sermon in a book, and publishes that book, hath preached to all that reade it, a louder Sermon then
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:115792:146"/>
could be spoken in a Church. This I say to this purpose that we may separate truth from error, popular opinions from substantial Truths. For God preaches to us in the Scripture, and by his secret assistances and spiritual thoughts and holy motions: Good men preach to us when they by popular arguments, and humane arts and complyances expound and presse any of those doctrines which God hath preached unto us in his holy Word. But</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Holy Ghost is certainly the best Preacher in the world, and the words of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture the best sermons.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. All the doctrine of salvation is plainly set down there, that the most unlearned person by hearing it read, may understand all his duty. What can be plainer spoken then this, [<hi>Thou shalt not kill. Be not drunk with wine: Husbands love your wives: whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye so to them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>] The wit of man cannot more plainly tell us our duty, or more fully, then the Holy Ghost hath done already.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Good sermons, and good books are of excellent use: but yet they can serve no other end but that we practise the plain do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of Scripture.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. What <hi>Abraham</hi> in the parable said con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the brethren of the rich man, is here very proper: <hi>They have Moses and the Prophets le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Set apart some portion of thy time according to the opportunities of thy calling and necessary imployment, for the reading of holy Scripture; and if it be possible, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day reade or hear some of it read: you are sure that book teaches all truth, commands all holinesse, and promises all happinesse.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. When it is in your power to choose, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>custome your self to such portions which are most plain and certain duty, and which contain the story of the Life and Death of our blessed Saviour.

                     <p n="3">3. Fail not, diligently to attend to the reading of holy Scriptures upon those dayes wherein it is most publickly and solemnly read in Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es: for at such times, besides the learning our duty, we obtain a blessing along with it, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming to us upon those dayes apart of the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Divine worship.</p>

                     <p n="5">5.

                  <p>FAsting, if it be considered in it self without relation to Spiritual ends, is a duty no where enjoyned, or counselled. But Christianity hath to do with it, as it may be made an instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Spirit by subduing the lusts of the flesh, or removing any hindrances of religion; And it hath been practised by all ages of the Church, and advised in order to three mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries. 1. To Prayer. 2. To Mortification of bodily lusts. 3. To Repentance: and is to be practised according to the following measures.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. Fasting in order to prayer is to be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured by the proportions of the times of prayer: that is, it ought to be a total faft from all things during the solemnity (unlesse a probable ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity intervene.) Thus the Jews eate nothing upon the Sabbath-dayes till their great offices were performed, that is, about the sixth hour: and S. <hi>Peter</hi> used it as an argument, that the Apostles in Pente<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ost were not drunk, because it was but the third hour of the day, of such a day, in which it was not lawful to eat or drink til the sixth hour: and the Jews were offended at the Disciples for plucking the ears of corn upon the
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:115792:148"/>
Sabbath early in the morning, because it was before the time in which by their customs they esteemed it lawful to break their fast. In imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of this custom, and in prosecution of the reason of it, the Christian Church hath religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously observed fasting before the Holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion: and the more devout persons (though without any obligation at all) refused to eat or drink till they had finished their morning devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: and further yet upon dayes of publick humiliation, which are designed to be spent wholly in Devotion, and for the averting Gods judgements (if they were imminent) fasting is commanded together with prayer, commanded (I say) by the Church to this end, that the Spirit might be clearer and more Angelical when it is quitted in some proportions from the loads of flesh.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Fasting, when it is <hi>in order to Prayer,</hi> must be a total abstinence from all meat, or else an abatement of the quantity: for the help which fasting does to prayer cannot be served by changing flesh into fish, or milk-meats into dry diet, but by turning much into little, or little into none at all during the time of solemn and extraordinary prayer.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Fasting <hi>as it is instrumental to Prayer,</hi> must be attended with other aids of the like vertue and efficacy, such as are, removing for the time all worldly cares and secular businesses; and therefore our blessed Saviour enfolds these parts within the same caution.

When <hi>Fasting is intended to serve the duty of Repentance,</hi> it is then best chosen when it is short, sharp and afflictive; that is, <hi>either a total abstinence</hi> from all nourishment (according as we shall appoint, or be appointed) during such a time as is separate for the solemnity and attendance upon the imployment: or if we shall extend our severity beyond the solemn dayes, and keep our anger against our sin, as we are to keep our sorrow, that is, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in a readinesse, and often to be called upon; <hi>then, to refuse a pleasant morsel,</hi> to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine from the bread of our desires, and onely to take wholsome and lesse pleasing nourishment, vexing our appetite by the refusing a lawful satisfaction, since in its pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulancie and luxurie it preyed upon an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Fasting designed for repentance</hi> must be ever joyned with an extream care that we fast from sin: for there is no greater folly or undecency in the world, then to commit that for which I am now judging and condemning my self. This is the best fast: and the other may serve to promote the interest of this, by increasing the disaffection to it, and multiplying argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments against it.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. He that <hi>fasts for repentance,</hi> must, during that solemnity, abstain from all bodily delights, and the sensuality of all his senses, and his appetites; for a man must not when he mourns in his fast be merry in his sport; weep at din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and laugh all day after; have a silence in his kitchen, and musick in his chamber; judge the stomack, and feast the other se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If a man have offended in his palate, he may choose to fast onely; if he have sinned in softnesse and in his touch, he may choose to lye hard, or work hard, and use sharp inflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: but although this Discipline be proper and particular, yet because the sorrow is of the whole man, no sense must rejoyce, or be with any study or purpose feasted and entertained softly. This rule is intended to relate to the solemn dayes appointed for repentance pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly or privately: besides which in the whole course of our life, even in the midst of our most festival and freer joyes we may sprinkle some single instances, and acts of self condemning, or punishing: as to refuse a pleasant morsel, or a delicious draught with a t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It may be one day of Humiliation will not obtain the blessing, or alone kill the lust, yet it must not be despis'd, if it can do any thing towards it. An act of Fasting is an act of self-denial, and though it do not produce the habit, yet it is a good act.</p>

When the principal end why a Fast is publickly prescribed, is obtained by some other instrument in a particular person; as if the spirit of Fornication be cur'd by the rite of Marriage, or by a gift of chastity, yet that person so eased, is not freed from the Fasts of the Church by that alone, if those fasts can prudently serve any other end of Religion, as that of prayer, or repentance, or mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of some other appetite: for when it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumental to any end of the Spirit, it is freed from superstition, and then we must have some other reason to quit us from the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or that alone will not do it.</p>

When the Fast publickly command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by reason of some indisposition in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular person cannot operate to the end of the Commandment, yet the avoiding offence, and the complying with publick order is reason e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to make the obedience to be necessary.

                  <p>TRue naturall Religion, that which was common to all Nations and Ages did principally relye upon four great propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. 1. That there is one God. 2. That God is nothing of those things which wee see. 3. That God takes care of all things below and governs all the World. 4. That hee is the Great Creator of all things without himself: and according to these were fram'd the four first precepts of the Decalogue. In the first, the Unity of the Godhead is expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirmed. In the second, his invisibility
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:115792:152"/>
and immateriality. In the third is affirmed Gods government and providence, by aveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them that swear falsly by his Name, by which also his Omniscience is declared. In the fourth Commandement, hee proclaims himself the Maker of Heaven and Earth: for in memory of Gods rest from the work of six dayes the seventh was hallowed into a Sabbath: and the keeping it was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing GOD to bee the great Maker of Heaven and Earth; and consequently to this, it also was a confession of his goodnesse, his Omnipotence and his Wisdom, all which were written with a Sun beam in the great book of the Creature.</p>
                  <p>So long as the Law of the Sabbath was bound upon Gods people, so long GOD would have that to be the folemn manner of confessing these attributes; but when <hi>the Priesthood being changed there was a change also of the Law,</hi> the great duty remain'd unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in changed circumstances. We are eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally bound to confesse God Almighty to be the Maker of Heaven and Earth; but the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of confessing it, is chang'd from a rest or a doing nothing, to a speaking something, from a day to a symbol, from a ceremony to a substance, from a Jewish rite to a Christian duty: we professe it in our Creed, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse it in our lives, we describe it by every line of our life, by every action of duty, by faith, and trust, and obedience: and we do also upon great reason comply with the Jewish manner of confessing the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, so far as it is instrumental to a real duty. We keepe one day in seven, and so confesse the manner and circumstance of the
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:115792:152"/>
Creation: and we rest also that we may tend holy duties: so imitating Gods rest better then the Jew in <hi>Synesius</hi> who lay upon his face from evening to evening, and could not by stripes or wounds be raised up to steer the ship in a great storm: Gods rest was not a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural cessation: hee who could not labour could not be said to rest; but Gods rest is to be understood to be a beholding and a rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing in his work finished: and therefore we tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly represent Gods rest, when we confesse and rejoyce in Gods works and Gods glory.</p>
                  <p>This the Christian Church does upon every day, but especially upon the Lords day, which she hath set apart for this and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And now, upon the Lords day we are not tyed to the rest of the Sabbath, but to all the work of the Sabbath: and we are to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain from bodily labour, not because it is a direct duty to us as it was to the Jews, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is necessary in order to our duty, that we attend to the Offices of Religion.</p>
                  <p>The observation of the Lords day differs nothing from the observation of the Sabbath <hi>in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="276" facs="tcp:115792:153"/>
had a Divine Commandement for their day, which we have not for ours: but we have many Commandements to do all that honour to GOD which was intended in the fourth Commandement: and the Apostles appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the first day of the week, for doing it in solemne Assemblies; and the manner of worshipping God and doing him solemn ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and service upon this day we may best ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve in the following measures.</p>
                  <div type="subsection">
                     <head>Rules for keeping the Lords day and other Christian Festivals.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. When you go about to distinguish Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stival dayes from common, do it not by lesse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the devotions of ordinary dayes, that the common devotion may seem bigger upon Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stivals, but on every day keep your ordinary devotions intire, and enlarge upon the Holy day.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Upon <hi>the Lords day</hi> wee must abstaine from all servile and laborious workes, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept such which are <hi>matters of necessity, of common life, or of great charity:</hi> for these are permitted by that authority which hath separated the day for holy uses. The Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath of the Jewes though consisting princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally in rest, and established by God, did yeeld to these. <hi>The labour of Love</hi> and the labours of Religion were not against the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and the spirit of the Commandement, for which the Letter was decreed, and to which it ought to minister: And therefore much more is it so on the Lords day, where the Letter is wholly turned into Spirit, and there is no Commandement of God, but of spiritual
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:115792:153"/>
and holy actions. The Priests might kill their beasts and dresse them for sacrifice; and Christ though born under the law, might heal a sick man, and the sick man might carry h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And therefore this is to be enlarged in the Gospel, whose Sabbath or rest is but a circumstance, and accessory to the principal and spiritual du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: Upon the Christian Sabbath, necessity is to be served first, then charity, and then religion; for this is to give place to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity <hi>in great instances</hi>; and the second to the first <hi>in all</hi>; and in all cases <hi>God is to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped in spirit and in truth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Lords day being the remembrance of a great blessing, must be a day of joy, festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, spiritual rejoycing and thanksgiving, and therefore it is a proper work of the day to let your devotions spend themselves in singing or reading Psalms, in recounting the great works of God, in remembring his mercies, in worshipping his excellencies, in celebrating his attributes, in admiring his person, in sending portions of pleasant meat to them for whom nothing is provided, &amp; in all the arts and instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of advancing Gods glory, &amp; the reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of religion: in which it were a great decency
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:115792:154"/>
that a memorial of the resurrection should be inserted, that the particular religion of the day be not swallowed up in the general: And of this we may the more easily serve our selves by rising seasonably in the morning to private de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, and by retiring at the leisures and spaces of the day not imployed in publick offices.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Fail not to be present at the publick hours and places of prayer, entring early and cheerfully, attending reverently and devoutly, abiding patiently during the whole office, pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously assisting at the prayers, and gladly also hearing the Sermon, and at no hand omitting to receive the Holy Communion when it is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered (unlesse some great reason excuse it) this being the great solemnity of thanksgiving, and a proper work of the day.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. After the solemnities are past, and in the intervalls between the morning and even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing devotion (as you shall finde op portunity) visit sick persons, reconcile differences, do offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Neighbourhood, inquire into the needs of the poor, especially house-keepers, relieve them as they shall need, and as you are able: for then we truely rejoyce in God, when we make our neighbours, the poor members of Christ, rejoyce together with us.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Whatsoever you are to do your self as necessary, you are to take care that others also, who are under your charge, do in their station &amp; manner. Let your servants be called to Church, and all your family that can be spared from ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary &amp; great houshold ministeries: those that cannot, let them go by turns, and be supplyed otherwise as well as they may: and provide on these dayes especially that they be instructed in the articles of faith, and necessary parts of their duty.</p>
                     <p n="7">
                        <pb n="279" facs="tcp:115792:154"/>7. Those who labour hard in the week, must be eased upon the Lords day; such ease being a great charity and alms: but at no hand must they be permitted to use any unlawful games, any thing forbidden by the laws, any thing that is scandalous, or any thing that is dangerous, and apt to mingle sin with it; no games prompting to wantonnesse, to drunkennesse, to quarrelling, to ridiculous and superstitious customs, but let their refreshments be innocent, and charitable, and of good report, and not exclusive of the duties of religion.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Beyond these bounds because neither God nor man hath passed any obligation upon us, we must preserve our <hi>Christian liberty and not suffer our selves to be intangled with a yoke of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage</hi>: for even a good action may become a snare to us, if we make it an occasion of scruple by a pretence of necessity, binding loads upon the conscience not with the bands of God, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>f men, and of fancy, or of opinion, or of tyranny. Whatsoever is laid upon us by the hands of man, must be acted and accounted of by the measures of a man; but our best measure is this: He keeps the Lords day best that keeps it with most religion, and with most charity.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. What the Church hath done in the article of the resurrection, she hath in some measure done in the other articles of the Nativity, of the Ascension, and of the Descent of the Holy Ghost at Pentecost: And so great blessings de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve an anniversary solemnity, since he is a very unthankful person that does not often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord them in the whole year, and esteem them the ground of his hopes, the object of his faith, the comfort of his troubles, and the great ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxes
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:115792:155"/>
of the divine mercy greater then all the victories over our temporal enemies, for which all glad persons usually give thanks. And if with great reason the memory of the resurrection does return solemnly every week, it is but rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son the other should return once a year. * To which I adde, that the commemoration of the articles of our Creed in solemn dayes and offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces is a very excellent instrument to convey and imprint the sense and memory of it upon the spirits of the most ignorant person. For as a picture may with more fancy convey a story to a man, then a plain narrative either in word or writing: so a real representment, and an office of remembrance, and a day to declare it, is f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>r more impressive then a picture, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther art of making and fixing imagery.</p>

But the Holy day is best kept by giving God thanks for the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent persons, Apostles or Martyrs we then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, and by imitating their lives: this all may do: and they that can also keep the solemnity, must do that too, when it is publickly enjoyned.</p>

<pb n="282" facs="tcp:115792:156"/>
people to pray often. But we may consider: That first it is a duty commanded by God and his holy Son: 2. It is an act of grace and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est honour that we dust and ashes are admitted to speak to the Eternal God, to run to him as to a Father, to lay open our wants to complain of our burdens, to explicate our scruples, to beg remedy and ease, support and counsel, health and safety, deliverance and salvation: and 3. God hath invited us to it by many gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious promises of hearing us. 4. He hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed his most glorious Son to be the presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of prayer, and to make continual inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession for us to the throne of grace. 5. He hath appointed an Angel to present the prayers of his servants: and 6. Christ unites them to his own, and sanctifies them, and makes them ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective and prevalent: and 7. Hath put it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of men to rescind or alter all the decrees of God which are of one kinde, (that is, conditional, and concerning our selves and our final estate, and many instances of our inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medial or temporal) by the power of prayers. 8. And the prayers of men have saved cities and kingdoms from ruine; prayer hath raised dead men to life, hath stopped the violence of fire, shut the mouths of wilde beasts, hath altered the course of nature, caused rain in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, and drowth in the sea, it made the Sun to go from West to East, and the Moon to stand still, and rocks and mountains to walk, and it cures di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="283" facs="tcp:115792:156"/>
God, a desiring things fit to be desired, and an expression of this desire to God as we can, and as becomes us: And our unwillingnesse to pray, is nothing else but a not desiring what we ought passionately to long for; or if we do desire it, it is a choosing rather to misse our sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction and felicity, then to ask for it.</p>
                     <p>There is no more to be said in this affair, but that we reduce it to practise according to the following Rules.</p>

                  <div type="subsection">
                     <head>Rules for the practise of Prayer.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. We must be careful that we never ask any thing of God that is sinful, or that directly ministers to sin: for that is to ask of God to dishonour himself, and to undoe us: we had need consider what we pray; for before it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns in blessing it must be joyn'd with Christs intercession, and presented to God: Let us principally ask of God power and assistances to do our duty, to glorifie God, to do good works; to live a good life, to dye in the fear and favour of God, and eternal life: these things God delights to give, and commands that we shall ask, and we may with confidence expect to be answered graciously; for these things are promised without any reservation of a secret condition: if we ask them, and do our duty towards the obtaining them, we are sure never to misse them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. We may lawfully pray to God for the gifts of the Spirit that minister to holy ends, such as are the gift of preaching, the spirit of prayer, good expression, a ready and unloosed tongue, good understanding, learning, oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities to publish them, &amp;c. with these onely restraints. 1. That we cannot be so confident
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:115792:157"/>
of the event of those prayers, as of the former. 2. That we must be curious to secure our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention in these desires, that we may not ask them to serve our own ends, but only for Gods glory, and then we shall have them, or a blessing for desiring them: In order to such purposes our intentions in the first desires can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be amisse; because they are able to san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie other things, and therefore cannot be unhallowed themselves. 3. We must submit to Gods will, desiring him to choose our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, and to furnish out our persons as he shall see expedient.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Whatsoever we may lawfully desire of temporall things, wee may lawfully ask of God in prayer, and we may expect them as they are promised. 1. Whatsoever is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to our life and being is promised to us; and therefore we may with certainty expect food and raiment; food to keep us alive; clothing to keepe us from nakednesse and shame; so long as our life is permitted to us, so long all things necessary to our life shall be ministred: we may be secure of mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, but not secure of our life, for that is promised, not this: onely concerning food and raiment we are not to make accounts by the measure of our desires, but by the measure of our needs. 2. Whatsoever is convenient for us, pleasant, and modestly delectable, we may pray for; so we do it 1. with submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Gods will. 2. Without impatient de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires. 3. That it be not a trifle and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable, but a matter so grave and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as to be a fit matter to be treated on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and our souls. 4. That we ask it not to spend upon our lusts, but for ends of
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:115792:157"/>
justice, or charity, or religion, and that they be imployed with sobriety.</p>

                     <p n="16">16. A vow to God is an act of prayer, and a great degree and instance of opportunity, &amp; an increase of duty by some new uncomman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded instance, or some more eminent degree of duty, or frequency of action, or earnestnesse of spirit in the same. And because it hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed God in all Ages of the World to admit of entercourse with his servants in the matter of vows, it is not ill advice, that we make vows to God in such cases in which we have great need, or great danger. But let it be done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to these rules, and by these cautions.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That the matter of the vow be lawful. 2. That it be useful in order to Religion or
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:115792:161"/>
charity. 3. That it be grave, not trifling and impertinent, but great in our proportion of duty towards the blessing. 4. That it be in an uncommanded instance, that is, that it be <hi>of something,</hi> or <hi>in some manner,</hi> or <hi>in some degree</hi> to which formerly wee were not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged, or which wee might have omitted without sinne. 5. That it bee done with prudence, that is, that it be safe in all the circumstances of person, lest we beg a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and fall into a snare. 6. That every vow of a new action bee also accompanied with a new degree and enforcement of our essential and unalterable duty: such as was <hi>Iacobs</hi> vow; that (besides the payment of a tithe) <hi>God should be his God</hi>: that so hee might strengthen his duty to him first in es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentials and precepts; and then in additio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals and accidentals. For it is but an ill Tree that spends more in leaves and suck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and gummes, then in fruit: and that thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse and Religion is best, that first se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures duty, and then enlarges in counsels. Therefore let every great prayer and great need, and great danger draw us to GOD, neerer by the approach of a pious purpose to live more strictly, and let every mercy of GOD answering that prayer produce a real performance of it. 7. Let not young begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in Religion enlarge their hearts and streighten their liberty by vowes of long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance: nor (indeed) any one else with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a great experience of himself, and of all accidental dangers.

                     <p>If we feel our spirits apt to wander in our prayers, and to retire into the World, or to things unprofitable, or vain and impertinent.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Use prayer to bee assisted in prayer: pray for the spirit of supplication, for a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, fixed, and recollected spirit: and when to this you adde a moral industry to be stea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in your thoughts, whatsoever wandrings after this do return irremediably, are a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery of Nature, and an imperfection, but no sinne while it is not cherished and indulged too.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In private it is not amisse to attempt the
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:115792:162"/>
cure by reducing your prayers into Collects, and short forms of prayer, making voluntary interruptions and beginning again, that the want of spirit and breath may be supplied by the short stages and periods.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. When you have observed any conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable wandring of your thoughts, binde your self to repeat that prayer again with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual attention, or else revolve the full sense of it in your spirit, and repeat it in all the effect and desires of it: and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly the tempter may be driven away with his own art, and may cease to interpose his trifles, when hee perceives they doe but vex the person into carefulnesse, and piety: and yet hee loses nothing of his devotion, but doubles the earnestnesse of his care.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. If this bee not seasonable, or oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, or apt to any Mans circumstances, yet be sure with actual attention to say a hearty Amen to the whole prayer, with one uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted desire, earnestly begging the graces men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the prayer: for that desire does the great work of the prayer and secures the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, if the wandring thoughts were against our will, and disclaimed by contending a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Avoid multiplicity of businesses of the World; and in those that are unavoidable, labour for an evennesse and tranquillity of spirit, that you may be untroubled and smooth in all tempests of fortune: for so we shall better tend Religion, when we are not torn in pieces with the cares of the World, and seiz'd upon with low affections, passions and interest.</p>
                     <p n="6">
                        <pb n="295" facs="tcp:115792:162"/>6. It helps much to attention and actual ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertisement in our prayers, if we say our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers silently, without the voice, onely by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="7">7. To incite you to the use of these or any other counsels you shall meet with, remember that it is a great undecency to desire of God to hear those prayers, a great part whereof we do not hear our selves.

                     <p>The second temptation in our prayer is a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diousnesse of spirit, or a wearinesse of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment: like that of the Jews, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained that they were weary of the new moons, and their souls loathed the frequent return of their Sabbaths: so do very many Christians, who first pray without fervour and earnestnesse of spirit: and secondly meditate but seldom, and that without fruit, or sence or affection: or thirdly who seldom examine their consciences, and when they do it, they do it but sleepily, slightly, without compunction, or hearty purpose, or fruits of amendment. 4. They enlarge themselves in the thoughts and fruition of temporal things, running for comfort to them onely in any sadnesse and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune. 5. They love not to frequent the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, nor any the instruments of religion, as sermons, confessions, prayers in publick,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:115792:163"/>
fastings, but love ease, and a loose undisciplin'd life. 6. They obey not their superiours, but follow their own judgement, when their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment follows their affections, and their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons follow sense and worldly pleasures. 7. They neglect, or dissemble, or defer, or do not attend to the motions and inclinations to vertue which the spirit of God puts into their soul. 8. They repent them of their vows and holy pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses, not because they discover any indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scretion in them, or intolerable inconvenience, but because they have within them labour, and (as the case now stands to them) displeasure. 9. They content themselves with the first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and necessary parts of vertue, and when they are arrived thither, they sit down, as if they were come to the mountain of the Lord, and care not to proceed on toward perfection. 10. They enquire into all cases in which it may be lawful to omit a duty, and though they will not do lesse then they are bound to, yet they will do no more then needs must; for they do out of fear, and self love, not out of the love of God, or the spirit of holinesse and zeal. The event of which will be this. He that will do no more then needs must, will soon be brought to omit something of his duty, and will be apt to believe lesse to be necessary then is.</p>

                     <p>The Remedies against this temptation are these.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Order your private devotions so, that they become not arguments and causes of tedious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse by their indiscreet length; but reduce
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:115792:163"/>
your words into a narrower compasse, still keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the matter, and what is cut off in the length of your prayers, supply in the earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e of your spirit; for so nothing is lost while the words are changed into matter, and length of time into fervency of devotion. The forms are made not the lesse perfect, and the spirit is more, and the scruple is removed.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is not imprudent if we provide variety of forms of Prayer to the same purposes; that the change by consulting with the appetites of fancy, may better entertain the Spirit: and possibly we may be pleased to re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ite a hymn, when a collect seems flat to us and unpleasant, and we are willing to sing rather then to say, or to sing this rather then that: we are certain that variety is delightful, and whether that be natural to us, or an imperfection, yet if it be complyed with, it may remove some part of the temptation.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Break your office and devotion into frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and make frequent returnings by ejacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and abrupt entercourses with God; for so, no length can oppresse your tenderness and sicklinesse of spirit; and by often praying in such manner and in all circumstances, we shall habituate our souls to prayer, by making it the businesse of many lesser por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our time: and by thrusting in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween all our other imployments, it will make every thing relish of religion, and by degrees turn all into its nature.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Learn to abstract your thoughts and desires from pleasures and things of the world. For nothing is a direct cure to this evill, but cutting off all other loves and
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:115792:164"/>
adherences. Order your affairs so, that religion may be propounded to you as a reward, and prayer as your defence, and holy actions as your security, and charity and good works as your treasure: Consider that all things else are satisfactions but to the brutish part of a man, and that these are the refreshments and relishes of that noble part of us by which we are better then beasts: and whatsoever other instrument, exercise or consideration is of use to take our loves from the world, the same is apt to place them upon God.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Do not seek for deliciousnesse and sensible consolations in the actions of religion, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly regard the duty and the conscience of it. For although in the beginning of religion most frequently, and at some other times irregularly, God complyes with our infirmity, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages our duty with little overflowings of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual joy, and sensible pleasure, and delicacies in prayer, so as we seem to feel some little beam of Heaven and great refreshments from the spirit of consolation; yet this is not alwayes safe for us to have, neither safe for us to expect and look for: and when we do, it is apt to make us cool in our enquiries and waitings upon Christ when we want them: It is a running af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, not for the miracles, but for the loaves; not for the wonderful things of God, and the desires of pleasing him, but for the pleasures of pleasing our selves. And as we must not judge our devotion to be barren or unfruitful when we want the overflowings of joy running over: so neither must we cease for want of them; If our spirits can serve God choosingly and gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily out of pure conscience of our duty, it is better in it self, and more safe to us.</p>
                     <p n="6">
                        <pb n="299" facs="tcp:115792:164"/>6. Let him use to soften his spirit with fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent meditation upon sad and dolorous ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, as of death, the terrours of the day of judgement; fearful judgements upon sinners, strange horrid accidents, fear of Gods wrath, the pains of Hell, the unspeakable amazements of the damned, the intolerable load of a sad Eternity. For whatsoever creates fear, or makes the spirit to dwell in a religious sadnesse, is apt to entender the spirit, and make it devout and plyant to any part of duty. For a great fear, when it is ill managed, is the parent of super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition; but a discreet and well guided fear produces religion.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Pray often and you shall pray oftner, and when you are accustomed to a frequent devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it will so insensibly unite to your nature and affections, that it will become trouble to omit your usual or appointed prayers: and what you obtain at first by doing violence to your inclinations, at last will not be left with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out as great unwillingnesse as that by which at first it entred. This rule relyes not onely upon reason derived from the nature of habits, which turn into a second nature, and make their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons easy, frequent &amp; an delightful: but it relyes upon a reason depending upon the nature and constitution of grace, whose productions are of the same nature with the parent, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creases it self, naturally growing from granes to huge trees, from minutes to vast proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and from moments to Eternity. But be sure not to omit your usual prayers without great reason, though without sin it may be done; because after you have omitted some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, in a little while you will be passed the scruple of that, and begin to be tempted to
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:115792:165"/>
leave out more: keep your self up to your usual forms; you may enlarge when you will; but do not contract or lessen them without a very probable reason.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Let a man frequently and seriously by imagination place himself upon his death-bed, and consider what great joyes he shall have for the remembrance of every day well spent; and what then he would give that he had so spent all his dayes: He may guesse at it by propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: for it is certain he shall have a joyful and prosperous night, who hath spent his day holily; and he resignes his soul with peace into the hands of God, who hath lived in the peace of God, and the works of religion in his life time. This consideration is of a real event, it is of a thing that will certainly come to passe. <hi>It is appointed for all men once to die, and after death comes judgement</hi>; the apprehension of which is dreadful, and the presence of it is intolerable, unlesse by religion and sanctity we are dispos'd for so venerable an appearance.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. To this may be useful that we consider the easinesse of Christs yoke, the excellences and sweetnesses that are in religion, the peace of conscience,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>See the Great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplar, Part.</hi> 3. <hi>Disc.</hi> 14. <hi>of the easiness of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion.</hi>
                        </note> the joy of the Holy Ghost, the rejoycing in God, the simplicity and pleasure of vertue, the intricacy, trouble and businesse of sin; the blessings and health and reward <hi>of that,</hi> the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, the sicknesses and sad consequences <hi>of this</hi>; and that, if we are weary of the labours of religion, we must eternally sit still and do nothing: for whatsoever we do, contrary to it, is infinitely more full of labour, care, difficulty, and vexation.</p>
                     <p n="10">
                        <pb n="301" facs="tcp:115792:165"/>10. Consider this also, that tediousnesse of spirit, is the beginning of the most dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous condition &amp; estate in the whole World. For it is a great disposition to the sinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the holy Ghost; it is apt to bring a Man to backsliding, and the state of unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, to make him return to his vomit and his sink, and either to make the Man impatient, or his condition scrupulous, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfied, irksome and desperate: and <hi>it is better that he had never known the way of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, then after the knowledge of it, that he should fall away.</hi> There is not in the World a greater signe that the spirit of Reprobation is beginning upon a Man, then when hee is habitually and constantly, or very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, weary, and slights, or loaths holy Offices.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. The last remedy that preserves the hope of such a Man, and can reduce him to the state of zeal and the love of God, is a pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, sad, and a heavy affliction; not despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, but recreated with some intervals of kindenesse, and little comforts, or entertained with hopes of deliverance: which condition, if a Man shall fall into, by the grace of God he is likely to recover: but if this help him not, it is infinite oddes but he will <hi>quench the Spirit.</hi>

                  <p>LOve is as communicative as fire, as busie, and as active, and it hath four twin Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, extreme like each other; and but that the Doctors of the School have done as <hi>Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mars</hi> Midwife did, who bound a Scarlet threed, something to distinguish them, it would be very hard to call them asunder. Their names are: 1. <hi>Mercy.</hi> 2. <hi>Beneficence,</hi> or well-doing. 3. <hi>Liberality.</hi> And 4. <hi>Almes</hi>; which by a special priviledge hath obtained to be called after the Mothers name, and is commonly called, <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi> The first or eldest is seated in the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and it is that, which all the other must at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend. For Mercy without Almes is acceptable, when the person is disabled to expresse out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, what he heartily desires. But Almes without Mercy, are like prayers without devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Religion without Humility. 2. <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence,</hi> or well doing, is a promptnesse and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse of minde, making us to do offices of curtesie, and humanity to all sorts of persons in their need, or out of their need. 3. <hi>Liberality</hi> is a disposition of minde opposite to covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and consists in the despite and neglect of money upon just occasions, and relates to our friends, children, kinred, servants and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther relatives. 4. But <hi>Almes</hi> is a relieving the poor and needy. The first and the last onely
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:115792:166"/>
are duties of Christianity. The second and third are circumstances and adjuncts of these duties: for <hi>Liberality</hi> increases the degree of <hi>Almes,</hi> making our gift greater; and <hi>Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence</hi> extends it to more persons and orders of Men, spreading it wider. The former makes us sometimes to give more then we are able; and the latter gives to more then need by the necessity of Beggars, and serves the needs and conveniencies of persons, and supplies circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances: wheraes properly, <hi>Almes</hi> are doles and largesses to the necessitous and calamitous peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; supplying the necessities of Nature, and giving remedies to their miseries.</p>
                  <p>Mercy and Almes are the body and soul of that charity which we must pay to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours need: and it is a precept which God therefore enjoyn'd to the World, that the great inequality which he was pleased to suffer in the possessions and accidents of Men, might be reduced to some temper and evennesse; and the most miserable person might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to some sense and participation of felicity.</p>

Whatsoever is superfluous in thy estate is to be dispensed in alms. <hi>He that hath two coats must give to him that hath none</hi>; that is, he that hath beyond his need must give that which is beyond it: Only among needs we are to reckon not onely what will support our life, but also what will maintain the decency of our estate and person; not onely in present needs, but in all future necessities, and very probable contingencies, but no further: we are not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged beyond this, unlesse we see very great, publick and calamitous necessities: but yet, if we do extend beyond our measures, and give
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:115792:170"/>
more then we are able, we have the <hi>Philippians</hi> and many holy persons for our precedent, we have S. <hi>Paul</hi> for our encouragement, we have Christ for our Counseller, we have God for our rewarder, and a great treasure in Heaven for our recompence and restitution. But I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound it to the consideration of all Christian people, that they be not nice and curious, fond and indulgent to themselves in taking accounts of their personal conveniences, and that they make their proportions moderate and easy, according to the order and manner of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity; and the consequent will be this, that the poor will more plentifully be relieved, themselves will be more able to do it, and the duty will be lesse chargeable, and the owners of estates charged with fewer accounts in the spending them. It cannot be denied, but in the expences of all liberal and great personages many things might be spared: some superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous servants, some idle meetings, some unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary and imprudent feasts, some garments too costly, some unnecessary Law-suits, some vain journeyes: and when we are tempted to such needlesse expences, if we shall descend to moderation, and lay aside the surplusage, we shall finde it with more profit to be laid out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the poor members of Christ, then upon our own with vanity. But this is onely intended to be an advice in the manner of doing almes: for I am not ignorant that great variety of clothes alwayes have been permitted to Princes and Nobility, and others in their proportion; and they usually give those clothes as rewards to servants, and other persons needful enough, and then they may serve their own fancy and their duty too: but it is but reason and religion
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:115792:170"/>
to be careful, that they be given to such onely where duty, or prudent liberality, or almes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine them: but in no sence let them do it so as to minister to vanity, to luxury, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digality. The like also is to be observed in other instances. And if we once give our mindes to the study and arts of almes, we shall finde wayes enough to make this duty easy, profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and useful.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. He that playes at any game must resolve before hand to be indifferent to win or lose: but if he gives to the poor all that he wins, it is better then to keep it to himself: but it were better yet, that he lay by so much as he is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to lose, and let the game alone, and by giving so much almes, traffick for eternity. That is one way.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Another is, keeping the fasting dayes of the Church; which if our condition be such as to be able to cast our accounts, and make abatements for our wanting so many meals in the whole year, (which by the old appointment did amount to 153, and since most of them are fallen into desuetude, we may make up as many of them as we please by voluntary fasts) we may from hence finde a considerable reliefe for the poor. But if we be not willing sometimes to fast that our brother may ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>, we should ill dye for him. <hi>S. Martin</hi> had given all that he had in the world to the poor, save one coat, and that also he divided between two beggers. A Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the mount of <hi>Nitria</hi> was reduced at last to the Inventary of one Testament, and that book also was tempted from him by the needs of one whom he thought poorer then himself. Greater yet. S. <hi>Paulinus</hi> sold himself to slavery to redeem a young man, for whose captivity his
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:115792:171"/>
Mother wept sadly; and it is said that <hi>S. Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therine</hi> suck't the envenomd wounds of a villain who had injured her most impudently: And I shall tell you of a greater charity then all these put together: Christ gave himself to shame and death to redeem his enemies from bondage, and death, and Hell.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Learn of the frugal man, and onely avoid sordid actions and turn good husband and change your arts of getting into providence for the poor, and we shall soon become rich in good works; and why should we not do as much for charity, as for covetousnesse, for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as for the fading world, for God and the Holy Jesus, as for the needlesse supersluities of back and belly?</p>
                     <p n="14">14. In giving almes to beggers and persons of that low ranck, it is better to give little to each that we may give to the more, so extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our alms to many persons: but in charities of religion, as building Hospitals, Colledges, and houses for devotion, and in supplying the accidental wants of decayed persons, fallen from great plenty to great necessity, it is better to unite our almes then to disperse them, to make a noble relief or maintenance to one, and to restore him to comfort, then to support only his natural needs, and keep him alive only, unrescued from sad discomforts.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. The Precept of almes or charity bindes not indefinitely to all the instances and kindes of charity: for he that delights to feed the poor, and spends all his proportion that way, is not bound to enter into prisons and redeem captives: but we are obliged by the presence of circumstances, and the special disposition of providence, and the pityablenesse of an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>object,
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:115792:171"/>
to this or that particular act of charity. The eye is the sense of mercy, and the bowels are its organ, and that enkindles pity, and pity produces almes: <hi>when the eye sees what it never saw, the heart will think what it never thought</hi>: but when we have an object present to our eye, then we must pity, for there the providence of God hath fitted our charity with circumstances. He that is in thy sight or in thy Neighbourhood is fallen into the lot of thy charity.</p>

This duty is that alone wherby the future day of judgment shall be transacted. For nothing but charity &amp; almes is that whereby Christ shall declare the justice and mercy of the eternal sentence. Martyrdom it self is not there expressed, and no otherwise involved, but as it is the greatest charity. 3. Christ made himself the greatest and daily example of almes or charity.

It is nothing but a direct resolution never to enter into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the way of noble pleasure taken in the good of others. 3. It is most contrary to God. 4. And a just contrary state to the felicities and actions of Heaven, where every star encreases the light of the other, and the multitude of guests at the supper of the Lamb makes the eternal meal more festival. 5.

                           </note> for like fire when it wants vent, it will suppresse it self. It is good <hi>in a fever</hi> to have a tender and a smooth tongue; but it is better that it be so <hi>in anger</hi>; for if it be rough and distempered, <hi>there</hi> it is an ill signe, but <hi>here</hi> it is an ill cause. Angry passion is a fire, and angry words are like breath to fan them; together they are like steel and flint sending out fire by mutual collision: some men will discourse themselves into passion, and if their neighbour be enkindled too, together they flame with rage and violence.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Humility is the most excellent natural cure for anger in the world: for he that by daily considering his own infirmities and failings makes the errour of his neighbour or servant to be his own case, and remembers that he daily needs Gods pardon, and his brothers charity, will not be apt to rage at the levities or mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, or indiscretions of another; greater then which he considers that he is very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, and more inexcusably guilty of.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Consider the example of the ever blessed Jesus, who suffered all the contradictions of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and received all affronts and reproaches of malicious, rash and foolish persons, and yet in all them was as dispassionate and gentle as the morning sun in Autumn: and in this also he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded himself imitable by us. For if inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence it self did suffer so great injuries and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graces, it is no great matter for us quietly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:115792:174"/>
al the calamities of fortune &amp; indiscretion of servants, and mistakes of friends, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindnesses of kinred, and rudenesses of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, since we have deserved these and worse, even Hell it self.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. If we be tempted to anger in the actions of Government and Discipline to our inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours (in which case anger is permitted so far as it is prudently instrumental to Government, and onely is a sin when it is excessive and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable, and apt to disturbe our own dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, or to expresse it self in imprudent words or violent actions) let us propound to our selves the example of God the Father, who at the same time, and with the same tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity decreed Heaven and Hell, the joyes of blessed Angels and souls, and the torments of Devils and accursed spirits: and at the day of judgement when all the World shall burn under his feet, God shall not be at all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flam'd, or shaken in his essential seat and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre of tranquillity and joy. And if at first the cause seems reasonable, yet defer to execute thy anger till thou mayest better judge. For as <hi>Phocion</hi> told the <hi>Athenians,</hi> who upon the first news of the death of <hi>Alexander</hi> were ready to revolt, stay awhile, for if the King be not dead, your haste will ruine you. But if he be dead, your stay cannot prejudice your affairs, for he will be dead to morrow as well as to day: so if thy servant or inferiour deserve pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, staying till to morrow will not make him innocent, but it may possibly preserve thee so, by preventing thy striking a guiltlesse person, or being furious for a trifle.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Remove from thy self all provocations and incentives to anger; especially 1. Games

Do not entertain nor suffer talebearers: for they abuse our ears first, and then our credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and then steal our patience, and it may be for a lye; and if it be true, the matter is not considerable; or if it be, yet it is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable: and we may alwayes escape with patience at one of these out-lets: either <hi rend="sup">1</hi> By not hearing slanders, or <hi rend="sup">2</hi> By not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving them, or <hi rend="sup">3</hi> By not regarding the thing, or <hi rend="sup">4</hi> By forgiving the person. 4.

Nature rests and sits still when she hath her portion; but what which exceeds it, is a trouble and a burden: and therefore in true Philosophy, No man is rich but he that is poor according to the common account: for when God hath satisfied those needs which he made; that is, all that is natural, whatsoever is beyond it, is thirst and a disease, and unlesse it be sent back again in charity or religion, can serve no end but vice or vanity, it can encrease the appetite to represent the man poorer, and full of a new and artificial, unnatural need; but it never satisfies the need it makes, or makes the man richer. <hi>No wealth can satisfie the covetous desire of wealth.</hi>

But I consider that those who drink on still when their thirst is quenched, or eat even after they well dined are sorced to vomit, not onely their superfluity, but even that which at first was necessary: so those that covet more then they can temperately use, are oftentimes forced to part even with that patrimony which would have supported their persons in freedom and honour, and have satisfied all their reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able desires.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Contentednesse is therefore health be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause covetousnesse is a direct sicknesse: and it was well said of <hi>Aristippus</hi> (as <hi>Plutarch</hi> reports him) if any man after much eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be still unsatisfied, he hath no need of more meat or more drink, but of a Physician; he more needs to be purged then to be filled; and therefore since covetousnesse cannot be satisfied, it must be cured by emptinesse, and evacuation; The man is without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, unlesse he be reduced to the scant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of nature, and the measures of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:115792:179"/>
necessity. Give to a poor man a house, and a few cowes, pay his little debt, and set him on work, and he is provided for and quiet; but when a man enlarges beyond a fair posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion &amp; desires another Lordship, you spite him if you let him have it; for by that he is one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree the further off from rest in his desires and satisfaction: and now he sees himself in a bigger capacity to a larger fortune; and he shall never finde his period, till you begin to take away something of what he hath: for then he wil be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to be glad to keep that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is left; but reduce him to natures measures, &amp; there he shall be sure to finde rest: for there no man can desire beyond his belly full, and when he wants that, any one friend or charitable man can cure his poverty; but all the world cannot satisfy his covetousnes.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Covetousnesse is the most phantastical &amp; contradictory disease in the whole world, and it must therefore be incurable, because it strives against its own cure. No man therefore abstains from meat because he is hungry, nor from wine because he loves it and needs it: but the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous man does so: for he desires it passionately because he sayes he needs it, and when he hath it, he will need it still, because he dares not use it. He gets cloaths because he cannot be without them; but when he hath them, then he can: as if he needed c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>rn for his granary, &amp; cloaths for his wardrope, more then for his back and belly. For covetousness pretends to heap much toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for fear of want, and yet after all his pains and purchase, he suffers that really which at first he feared vainly; and by not using what he gets, he makes that suffering to be actual, present, and necessary, which in his lowest condition was but future, contingent &amp; possible. It stirs up the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:115792:179"/>
and takes away the pleasure of being satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. It increases the appetite and will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent it, it swells the <hi>principal</hi> to no purpose, and lessens the <hi>use</hi> to all purposes; disturbing the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of nature, and the designes of God; making <hi>money</hi> not to be the instrument of exchange or charity, nor corn to feed himself or the poor, nor wool to cloath himself or his brother, nor wine to refresh the sadnesse of the afflicted, nor his oyl to make his own countenance cheerful: but all these to look upon, and to tell over, and to take accounts by and make himself consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and wondered at by fools, that while he lives he may be called Rich, and when he dyes may be accounted Miserable, and like the Dish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers of <hi>China,</hi> may leave a greater heap of dirt for his Nephews, while he himself hath a new lot fallen to him in the portion of <hi>Dives</hi>: But thus the Asse carried wood and sweet herbs to the Baths, but was never washed or perfum'd himself: he heaped up sweets for others, while himself was filthy with smoak &amp; ashes. And yet it is considerable; If the man can be content to feed hardly, and labour extreamly, and watch carefully, and suffer affronts and disgrace that he may get money more then he uses in his tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and just needs, with how much ease might this man be happy? And with how great unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse and trouble does he make himself mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable? For he takes pains to get content, and when he might have it, he lets it go. He might better be content with a vertuous and quiet po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty then w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> an artificial troublesom &amp; vitious: The same diet &amp; a less labor would at first make him happy, and for ever after rewardable.</p>

descending to our weak understandings, to say, that he changes also upon Mans repentance, that he alters his decrees, revokes his sentence, cancels the Bils of accusation, throws the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of shame and sorrow from the Court of Heaven, and lifts up the sinner from the grave to life, from his prison to a throne, from Hell and the guilt of eternal torture, to Heaven and to a title to never ceasing felicities. If we be <hi>bound on earth</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we shall <hi>be bound in heaven</hi>; if we be absolved here, we shall be loosed there; if we repent, God will repent, and not send the evil upon us which we had deserved.</p>
                  <p>But repentance is a conjugation and society of many duties; and it containes in it all the parts of a holy life, from the time of return to the day of our death inclusively; and it hath in it somethings specially relating to the sins of our former dayes which are now to be abolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by special arts, and have obliged us to special labours, and brought in many new ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities, and put us into a very great deal of danger; and because it is a duty consisting of so many parts &amp; so much imployment, it also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires much time, and leaves a Man in the same degree of hope of pardon, as is his restitution to the state of righteousness and holy living, for which we covenanted in Baptism.</p>
                  <p>For wee must know that there is but one repentance in a Mans whole life, if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance be taken in the proper, and strict Evangelicall Covenant-sense, and not after the ordinary understanding of the word: That is, wee are but once to change our whole state of life, from the power of the Devil and his intire possession, from the state of sin and death, from the body of corruption, to the
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:115792:182"/>
life of grace, to the possession of Jesus, to the kingdom of the Gospel; and this is done in the baptism of water, or in the baptism of the Spirit, when the first rite comes to be verified by Gods grace coming upon us, and by our obedience to the heavenly calling, we work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together with God. After this change, if ever we fall into the contrary state, and be wholly estranged from God and Religion, and professe our selves servants of unrighteousnesse, God hath made no more covenant of restituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to us, there is no place left for any more repentance, or intire change of condition, or new birth: a Man can be regenerated but once: and such are voluntary, malicious A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postates, Witches, obstinate impenitent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and the like: But if we be overtaken by infirmity, or enter into the marches or borders of this estate, and commit a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous sin, or ten, or twenty, so we be not in the intire possession of the Devil, we are for the present in a damnable condition if we dye; but if we live we are in a recoverable condition; for so we may repent often: we repent or rise from death but once, but from sicknesse many times; and by the grace of God we shall be pardoned if so we repent. But our hopes of pardon are just as is the repentance, which if it be timely, hearty, industrious and effective, God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts: not by weighing granes or scruples, but by estimating the great proportions of our life; a hearty endeavour and an effectual ge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="1">1. He that repents truely is greatly sorrowful for his past sins; not with a superficial sigh or tear, but a pungent afflictive sorrow; such a sorrow as hates the sin so much, that the man would choose to dye rather then act it any more: This sorrow is called in Scripture [<hi>a weeping sorely, a weeping with bitternesse of heart, a weeping day and night, a sorrow of heart, a break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the spirit, mourning like a dove, and chattering like a swallow</hi>:] and we may read the degree and manner of it by the lamentations and sad accents of the Prophet <hi>Ieremy,</hi> when he wept for the sins of the nation; by the heart break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>David,</hi> when he mourned for his murder and adultery: and the bitter weeping of S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> after the shameful denying of his Master. <note place="margin">

Some peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple can shed tears for nothing, some for any thing; but the proper and true effects of a godly sorrow are; fear of the divine judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,

apprehension of Gods displeasure, watchings and strivings against sin, patiently enduring the crosse of sorrow (which God sends as their punishment) in accusation of our selves, in perpetually begging pardon, in mean and base opinion of our selves, and in all the natural productions from these according to our temper and constitution: for if we be apt to weep in other accidents, it is ill if we weep not also in the sorrows of repentance: not, that weeping is of it self a duty, but that the sorrow, if it be as great, will be still expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in as great a manner.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Our sorrow for sins must retain the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion</hi> of our sins, though <hi>not the equality</hi>; we have no particular measures of sins: we know not which is greater of Sacriledge or Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Idolatry or Covetousnesse, Rebellion or Witchcraft; and therefore God ties us not to nice measures of sorrow, but onely that we keep the general Rules of proportion; that is, that a great sin have a great grief; a smaller crime being to be washed off with a lesser shower.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Our sorrow for sins is then best accounted of for its degree,<note place="margin">Hugo de S. victor.</note> when it together with all the penal and afflictive duties of repentance, shall have equalled or exceeded the pleasure we had in commission of the sin.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. True repentance is a punishing duty, and acts its sorrow, and judges and condemns the sin by voluntary submitting to such sadnesses as God sends on us, or (to prevent the judgement of God) by judging our selves, and punishing our bodies and our spirits by such instruments of piety as are troublesome to the body: such as are, fasting, watching, long prayers, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:115792:184"/>
postures in our prayers, expensive alms, and all outward acts of humiliation. For he that must judge himself, must condemn him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self if he be guilty; and if he be condemned he must be punished; and if he be so judged, it will help to prevent the judgement of the Lord. <hi>S.

                        </note> But I before intimated that the <hi>punishing acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of repentance are onely actions of sorrow, and therefore are to make up the proportions of it. For our grief may be so full of trouble as to outweigh all the burdens of fasts and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily afflictions, and then the other are the lesse necessary; and when they are used, the benefit of them is to obtain of God a remission or a lessening of such temporal judgements which God hath decreed against the sins, as it was in the case of <hi>Ahab</hi>: but the sinner is not by any thing of this reconciled to the eternal favour of God; for as yet, this is but the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction to Repentance.</p>

No Man is to reckon his pardon im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately upon his returnes from sin to the beginnings of good life, but is to begin his hopes and degrees of confidence according as sin dyes in him, and grace lives; as the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits of sin lessen, and righteousnesse growes, according as sin returnes but seldom in smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler instances and without choice, and by sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize without deliberation, and is highly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relished and presently dash'd against the Rock Christ Jesus by a holy sorrow and renewed care, and more strict watchfulnesse. For a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life being the condition of the Covenant on our part, as we return to God, so God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to us, and our state returns to the proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities of pardon.</p>

because every new sin, and every great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining from the wayes of God is still a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of new danger, and hath increased Gods anger, and hath made him more uneasie to grant pardon: and when he does grant it, it is upon harder terms both for doing and suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; that is, we must do more for pardon, and it may be, suffer much more. For we must know that God pardons our sins by parts: as our duty increases, and our care is more prudent and active, so Gods anger decreases: and yet it may be the last sin you committed, made God unalterably resolv'd to send upon you some sad judgement. Of the particulars in all cases wee are uncertain; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee have reason alwayes to mourn for our sinnes that have so provoked GOD, and made our condition so full of danger, that it may be, no prayers, or tears or du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty can alter his sentence concerning some sad judgement upon us.

But this he did for us, he paid the score of our sins, only that we might be admitted to repent, and that this repentance might be effectual to the great purposes of felicity and salvation.</p>

This is the joy of our Lord himself directly, not of the Angels, save onely by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion: The joy (said our blessed Saviour) shall be <hi>in the presence</hi> of the Angels; they shall see the glory of the Lord, the answering of his prayers, the satisfaction of his desires, and the reward of his sufferings, in the repentance and consequent pardon of a sinner. For therefore he once suffered, and for that reason he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyces for ever: and therefore when a penitent sinner comes to receive the effect and full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summation of his pardon, it is called [<hi>an entring into the joy of our Lord</hi>] that is, a partaking of that joy which Christ received at our coversion and enjoyed ever since.</p>

It cost the heart blood of the Son of God to obtain Heaven for us upon that condition; and who shall dye again to get Heaven for us upon easier terms?

                  <p>THe celebration of the holy Sacrament is the great mysteriousnesse of the Christian religion, and succeeds to the most solemn rite of natural and Judaical religion, the Law of sacrificing. For God spared mankinde, and took the sacrifie of beasts together with our solemn prayers for an instrument of expiation. But these could not purifie the soul from sin, but were typical of the sacrifice of something that could. But nothing could do this, but either the offering of all that sinned, that every man should be the <hi>anathema</hi> or <hi>devo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="4">4. As Christ is pleased to represent to his Father that great Sacrifice as a means of atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and expiation for all mankinde, and with special purposes and intendment for all the elect, all that serve him in holinesse: so he hath appointed that the same ministery shall be done upon earth too, in our manner, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our proportion; and therefore hath constituted and separated an order of men, who by <hi>shewing forth the Lords death</hi> by Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental representation may pray unto God after the same manner that our Lord and high <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="5">5. As the Ministers of the Sacrament do in a Sacramental manner present to God the sacrifice of the crosse, by being imitators of Christs intercession; so the people are sacrificers too in their manner; for besides that, by saying <hi>Amen,</hi> they joyn in the act of him that ministers,

and make it also to be their own: so when they eat and drink the consecrated and blessed Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements worthily, they receive Christ within them, and therefore may also offer him to God, while in their sacrifice of obedience &amp; thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving they present themselves to God with Christ whom they have spiritually received, that is, themselves with that which will make them gracious and acceptable.

                  <p n="6">6. This is the sum of the greatest mystery of our Religion: it is the copy of the passion, and the ministration of the great mystery of our Redemption; and therefore whatsoever intitles us to the general priviledges of Christs passion, all that is necessary by way of disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the celebration of the Sacrament of his passion: because this celebration is our man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of applying or using it.

                  <p n="5">5. When we have this general and indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensably necessary preparation, we are to make our souls more adorn'd and trimm'd up with circumstances of pious actions, and special de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions, setting apart some portion of our time immediately before the day of solemnity according as our great occasions will permit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and this time is specially to be spent in actions of repentance, confession of our sins, renewing our purposes of holy living, praying for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of our failings, and for those graces which may prevent the like sadnesses for the time to come; meditation upon the passion, upon
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:115792:192"/>
the infinite love of God expressed in so great mysterious manners of redemption; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitely in all acts of vertue which may build our soules up into a Temple fit for the recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christ himself and the inhabitation of the holy Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The celebration of the holy Sacrament being the most solemne prayer, joyned with the most effectual instrument of its accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, must suppose us in the love of God, and in charity with all the World: and therefore we must before every Communion especially, remember what differences or jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies are between us and any one else; and recompose all disunions, and cause right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings betweene each other; offering to satisfie whom we have injur'd, and to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give them who have injur'd us, without thoughts of resuming the quarrel when the solemnity is over; for that is but to rake the embers in light and phantastick ashes: it must be quenched, and a holy flame en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindled: no fires must be at all, but the fires of love and zeal; and the altar of incense will send up a sweet perfume, and make atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for us.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. When the day of the feast is come, lay aside all cares and impertinencies of the World, and remember that this is thy <hi>Souls day</hi>; a day of traffique and entercourse with Heaven. Arise early in the morning. 1. Give God thanks for the approach of so great a blessing. 2. Confesse thy own unworthinesse to admit so Divine a Guest. 3. Then remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and deplore thy sinnes which have made thee so unworthy. 4. Then confesse Gods goodnesse and take sanctuary there, and upon

Make oblation of thy self wholly to be disposed by him, to the obedience of him, to his providence and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session, and pray him to enter, and dwell there for ever: And after this, with joy and holy fear, and the forwardness of love, addresse thy self to the receiving of <hi>him,</hi> to whom and by whom, and for whom, all faith, and all hope, and all love in the whole Catholick Church, both in Heaven &amp; Earth is design'd; <hi>him,</hi> whom Kings and Queens, and whole Kingdoms are in love with, and count it the greatest honour in the World, that their Crowns and Scepters are laid at his holy feet.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. When the holy Man stands at <hi>the Table of blessing</hi> and ministers the rite of consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then do as the Angels do, who behold, &amp; love, and wonder; that the Son of <hi>God</hi> should become food to the souls of his servants; that he who cannot suffer any change or <hi>lessening</hi> should be broken into pieces and enter into the body to support and nourish the spirit, and yet at the same time remain in Heaven while he descends to thee upon Earth; that he who hath essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial felicity should become miserable and dye sor thee, and then give himself to thee for ever to redeem thee from sin and misery; that by his wounds he should procure health to thee, by his affronts he should intitle thee to glory, by his death he should bring thee to life, and by becoming a Man he should make thee <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of the Divine nature.</hi> These are such glories that although they are made so obvious that each eye may behold them, yet they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so so deep, that no thought can fathome them:
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:115792:193"/>
But so it hath pleased him to make these my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries to be <hi>sensible,</hi> because the excellency and depth of the mercy is <hi>not intelligible</hi>; that while wee are ravished and comprehended within the infinitenesse of so vast &amp; mysterious a mercy, yet we may be as sure of it, as of that thing we see and feel, and smell and taste; but yet is so great, that we cannot understand it.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. These holy mysteries are offered to our senses, but not to bee placed under our feet; they are sensible, but not common: and therefore as the weaknesse of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments addes wonder to the excellency of the Sacrament: so let our reverence and venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble usages of them adde honour to the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and acknowledge the glory of the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, and the Divinity of the mercy. Let us receive the consecrated Elements with all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, and humility of body and spirit; and do this honour to it, that it be the first food we eat, and the first beverage we drink that day, unlesse it he in case of sicknesse, or other great necessity: and that your body and soul both be prepared to its reception with absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence from secular pleasures, that you may better have attended fastings and preparato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry prayers.

O teach me so to walk, that I may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver disrepute the honour of my Religion, nor stain the holy Robe which thou hast now put upon my soul, nor break my holy Vows, which <hi>I have made,</hi> and <hi>thou hast sealed,</hi> nor lose my right of inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, my priviledge of being coheir with Jesus, into the hope of which I have now further entred: but be thou pleased to love me with the love of a Father, and a Brother, and a Husband, and a Lord, and make me to serve thee in the communion of Saints, in receiving the Sacrament, in the practise of all holy vertues, in the imitation of thy life,

and conformity to thy sufferings; that I having now put on the Lord Jesus, may marry his loves and his enmities, may desire his glory, may obey his laws, and be united to his Spirit; and in the day of the LORD I may be found having on the Wedding Garment, and bearing in my body and soul the marks of the LORD JESUS, that I may enter into the joy of my LORD, and partake of his glories for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

                        <p>Lord, if I had lived innocently, I could not have deserved to receive the crumbs that fall from thy Table: How great is thy mercy who hast feasted me with the Bread of Virgins, with the Wine of Angels, with Manna from Heaven!</p>
                        <p>O when shall I passe from this dark glasse, from this vail of Sacraments, to the vision of thy eternal clarity, from eating thy Body, to beholding thy face in thy eternal Kingdom!</p>
