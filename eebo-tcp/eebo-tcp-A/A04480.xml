         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

our Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uior
Ieſus Chriſt,
The people of the
citie of Corinth, to
whome S. <hi>Paule</hi>
wrote this Epiſtle
or letter, were at great ſtrife, conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and variance among themſelues,
as touching the Preachers of Chriſts
<pb facs="tcp:3344:5"/>
Goſpell, and Miniſters dwelling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them. For, whereas God had
ſent them ſtore of Preachers, as <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
Paul, Apollo, Cephas,</hi> and ſuch
other, which were notable in the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie
of God; they of theſe great gifts
and benefits of God, tooke occaſion of
ſtrife, tooke (I ſay) occaſion of great
contention and debate among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.
For whoſoeuer liked <hi>Peter</hi> beſt,
would ſay, I hold of <hi>Peter;</hi> whoſoeuer
thought <hi>Pauls</hi> Doctrine better than
<hi>Peters,</hi> would ſay, I ſtand of <hi>Pauls</hi>
ſide; whoſoeuer againe thought that
<hi>Apollo</hi> excelled the reſt, would ſay,
I hold with <hi>Apollo.</hi> And thus of their
owne fancies, they tooke occaſion of
ſtrife, &amp; found fault with the preaching
of Chriſts Goſpell. As for <hi>Peter,</hi> as for
<hi>Paul,</hi> as for <hi>Apollo,</hi> they all preached
one thing, they taught one Doctrine,
there was no ſtrife, no debate, no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſention
among them. Yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
though the Schoolemaſters
agréed, the Diſciples and Schoolers
could not bée at one: though they all
preached one and the ſame Doctrine,
<pb facs="tcp:3344:5"/>
yet could not the people fancie their
Preachers alike. And therefore <hi>Paul</hi>
concluded before, and ſaid; <hi>Let no
man reioyce in men, for all is yours,
whether it bee Paule, or Apollo, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it bee Cephas or the world,
all is yours.</hi> And hereupon followed
theſe words of his, that you heard
read vnto you. <hi>As for vs</hi> (ſaith
Saint <hi>Paule) eſteeme vs as the
Miniſters of Chriſt:</hi> whatſoeuer
they bee that Preach vnto you the
Goſpell of GOD, regard them
as <hi>the Stewards of the ſecrets of
God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So it happeneth oftentimes that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the people iudge too much of the
Preachers of Gods word, or elſe they
iudge too little: Sometime they attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
vnto them too much honour, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
againe they giue them too little
honour: Sometime they credit them
too much, ſometime they beléeue them
nothing at all. So are the people
alwaies inconſtant, ſo are they moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
on either ſide. When <hi>Paule</hi>
and <hi>Barnabas</hi> at Liſtra began to<note place="margin">Act. 14.</note>
               <pb facs="tcp:3344:6"/>
preach, by and by the whole multitude
of the people thought them to be Gods
and no men, forthwith they erected Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars,
they brought their Sacrifices,
their oxen, their calues, their ſhéepe,
minding to haue ſacrificed vnto them,
and <hi>Paule</hi> they called <hi>Mercurius; Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas,
Iupiter.</hi> This was too great an
honour. And therefore when <hi>Paule</hi> and
<hi>Barnabas</hi> vnderſtood the ſame, they
rent their clothes, tore their owne
garments, run in among the people,
cried out and ſaid: <hi>Yee men and bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
why doe yee this?</hi> So likewiſe
<hi>Peter</hi> being appointed by God to goe
to <hi>Cornelius</hi> the Captaine,<note place="margin">Act. 10.</note> ſo ſoone
as he came in vnto him, by and by
<hi>Cornelius</hi> met him, fell downe at
his féete, and worſhipped him, hee
thought him a God and no Man. And
thus, as yée ſée, ſometimes the people
offended too much on that hand, and
gaue more honour and reuerence vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Gods Miniſters than God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
required, or they looked for:
Sometimes againe on the other hand,
they gaue them no reuerence, they
<pb facs="tcp:3344:6"/>
attributed no honour vnto them, they
did ſet too little by the Preachers of
Gods word; and this was a fault on
the other ſide.</p>
            <p>When Chriſt in our nature began
firſt to preach, and ſet abroad his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
will, and the glad tydings of
the Goſpell, the people forthwith
found fault with him; he is, ſaid they,
but a Carpenters ſon,<note place="margin">Iohn. 6.</note> wée know his
Father, wée know his Mother, he
was neuer ſet to Schoole, how can
this man haue learning? Afterward,
when the Diſciples and Apoſtles of
Chriſt preached and taught the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and beganne to ſpeake with
ſtrange tongues,<note place="margin">Act. 2.</note> in ſo much that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
man maruailed to heare his
owne ſpeach and language, both
<hi>Medes, Perſians,</hi> and they of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopotamia;</hi>
yet ſaid the people, theſe
men are full of new wine. And this
was too little honour. Therefore if
the Preacher bée too much honoured,
then is God diſhonoured: if hee bee
deſpiſed and nothing ſet by, then is
Chriſt himſelfe deſpiſed, and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded.

They that ſaid Chriſt was
a Carpenters ſonne, a man vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and ſuch a one as neuer went
to ſchoole: they that ſaid the Apoſtles
of Chriſt were full of new wine,
ſpake not this of any priuate ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
or hatered that they bare either
vnto Chriſt, or his Apoſtles, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to bring Gods word to ſhame, only
to bring Chriſts holy Goſpell out of
credit with the people: this was
their entent and purpoſe, and nothing
els. Therefore Saint <hi>Paule</hi> in this
place ſheweth the Corinthians how
they ſhould eſtéem the teachers of gods
holy word, how they ſhould thinke
and iudge of them. For the people
ſometime eſtéeme moſt a policicke
man, ſuch a man as by his great
wit is able to conclude Peace and
Leagues betwéene Princes, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
him that is of ſtout courage and
learned in the Lawes, they ſet moſt
by him that is eloquent and able to
perſwade; yea and they regard him
not that is not excellently learned,
and ſéene in all Sciences: but heere
<pb facs="tcp:3344:7"/>
Saint <hi>Paule</hi> ſheweth them, that
they ſhould not eſtéeme the Preachers
of Gods Goſpell as men politicke,
as men of great wit, as men of
ſtout courage, and learned in the
Law as men eloquent, and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
well ſéene in ſciences: but as
the Miniſters of Chriſt, and Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
of the ſecrets of God. Thus
ſhould the Miniſters of Chriſt bee
eſtéemed, and thus ought the teachers
of Gods word ſhew themſelues, as
Miniſters of Chriſt, and diſpenſers
of Gods ſecrets. And therefore ſaint
<hi>Paule</hi> in another place ſaith; <hi>We come
not to preach our ſelues,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Cor. 4.</note> all our
preaching, all our teaching, all our
Doctrine, is that you know Ieſus
Chriſt; as for our ſelues, wée are but
your ſeruants. So Chriſt himſelfe;
<hi>Qui de ſe loquitur, gloriam propriam
quaerit,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 7.</note> 
               <hi>Hee that ſpeaketh of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
ſeeketh his owne glorie,</hi> ſaith
Chriſt.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 3.</note> So <hi>Paule</hi> likewiſe, <hi>Quid Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trus,
quid Paulus, quid Apollo, niſi Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtri?</hi>
What is Peter, what is <hi>Paule, what
is Apollo?</hi> thinke you them any other
<pb facs="tcp:3344:8"/>
than the ſeruants and miniſters of
God? <hi>Paule hath planted, Apollo
watered, but God hath giuen the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe.</hi>
The encreaſe came not from
<hi>Peter,</hi> not from <hi>Paule,</hi> not from
<hi>Apollo,</hi> but from God alone. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo,
Paule,</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
els but the miniſters and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
of God; God is he that giueth
the encreaſe, God alone is hee that
giueth the encreaſe. When the great
Citie of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> vnderſtood of <hi>Iohn</hi>
the Baptiſt, and began to ſéeke
vnto him, they aſked him, <hi>What
art thou?</hi> Hee anſwered them, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go
vox clamantis in deſerto, Parate vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am
Domini.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn 1.</note> 
               <hi>I am.</hi> ſaid hee, <hi>a man not
worthy to be eſteemed, I am but a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger
ſent vnto you, I am nothing
els but a voice to cry, Prepare you the
way of the Lord.</hi> So <hi>Moſes</hi> and
<hi>Aaron</hi> that had the conducting of
the people of God, when the whole
Campe was in a tumult and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rore,
and the people ran in rage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them, like to haue ſlaine
them, they ſtretched out their hands
<pb facs="tcp:3344:8"/>
and ſaid,<note place="margin">Exod. 16.</note> 
               <hi>Non contra nos, ſed contra
Dominum, nam nos qui ſumus? This ſtir,
this hurly burly, this tumult, that you
make is not,</hi> ſaid they, <hi>againſt vs, but
againſt God; for alas, what are we?</hi> we
are but Gods ſeruants, Gods meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
appointed to lead and guid you.
Thus therefore ought euery man e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtéeme
the Preachers of Gods goſpell,
as meſſengers, as ſeruants as Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of Chriſt, thus ought euery man
thinke, and iudge of them.</p>
            <p>But what kind of ſeruant is this
Preacher, what manner of Miniſter
is he? Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>He is the Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
and Diſpenſer of Gods ſecrets,</hi> he
ſetteth foorth, and ſheweth abroad the
myſteries of his holy Goſpel. And theſe
myſteries that S. <hi>Paul</hi> here meaneth,
(to conclude in one word) are none
other than the Articles of our Faith:
That Chriſt is the Sonne of God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
by the holy Ghoſt, borne of the
virgine Marie; that he was crucified,
dead, buried, deſcended into Hell, roſe
againe, and ſitteth at the right hand of
his Father; that by his blood, our ſinnes
<pb facs="tcp:3344:9"/>
were waſhed away; that our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
ſhall at the laſt day ariſe, and we
poſſeſſe eternall life. Theſe be the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets,
theſe be the myſteries, that the
Miniſters of Chriſt, the ſeruants and
Stewards of God, do vtter and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
to Gods people: no wiſdome of
man is able to compaſſe this, no lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of this world able of it ſelfe to
expound theſe hidden ſecrets. For
ſaith Saint <hi>Paul, <hi>Animalis homo non
percipit ea quae ſunt ex Deo.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 2.</note> The natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
man perceiueth nothing of the
ſpirit of God,</hi> he vnderſtandeth not
ſuch things as are of God. It is foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhneſſe
vnto him, and he can not
perceiue it, for it muſt be ſpiritually
diſcerned.<note place="margin">Ioh. 1.</note> Chriſt himſelfe alſo, <hi>Non
ex hominibus, nequè ex voluntate carnis,
ſed ex voluntate Dei,</hi> they which are
Gods children, and able to vnderſtand
his myſteries, <hi>are ſuch which are not
borne of blood, nor of the will of the
fleſh, nor of the will of man, but of
God.</hi> When Chriſt had aſked of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
what he thought of him, and <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
had ſaid,<note place="margin">Math. 16.</note> 
               <hi>Tues Chriſtus, filius Dei
<pb facs="tcp:3344:9"/>
                  <hi>viui,</hi> Thou art Chriſt the Sonne of the
lyuing God:</hi> He anſwered, <hi>O hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie
art thou Simon the Sonne of Ionas,
for fleſh and blood hath not opened
that vnto thee, but my Father that is
in Heauen.</hi> Theſe myſteries there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
are onely opened by the ſpirit of
God, by Gods only working, not by
any wiſdome of man, not by any cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and great learning of this world.
Now therefore, ſaith Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>
thinke thus of vs, iudge vs to be the
Miniſters and ſeruants of God, and
marke well whether we reueal vnto
you Gods myſteries, and his holie
Goſpell; Conſider with your ſelues,
and ſée whether wée open vnto you
Gods hidden Secrets: By this ſhall
you know, whether wée be the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
and diſpenſers of Gods myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
            <p>But like as in S. <hi>Pauls</hi> time, there
was diſſention, ſtrife, &amp; great debate,
euen amongſt the Chriſtians, and ſuch
as profeſſed the name of God: So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
in our dayes, (good Bretheren)
euen in the time that wée our ſelues
<pb facs="tcp:3344:10"/>
haue ſéene, there hath béen diſcord and
parts-taking among vs. Some haue
ſaid, I will beléeue the old learning:
ſome againe haue ſaid, I will beléeue
the new: ſome haue ſaid I will credit
this man: ſome I will beléeue that
man. And thus the father hath fallen
out with the ſonne, the Mother with
the daughter, the brother with his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and one neighbor with another;
ech man defending that part, which he
himſelfe beſt liked. But alas, (good
Bretheren) this is no new thing, this
hath béen from the beginning, and
euen in Chriſtes time. For at what
time Chriſt himſelfe walked here on
this earth, &amp; began to preach the glory
of his father, ſome ſaid he was a good
man,<note place="margin">Ioh. 7. Luk. 7.</note> ſome other ſaid no, ſome ſaid he
was a Prophet, ſome other ſaid he was
none, but one that deceiued the people,
ſome reioyced that it pleaſed God to
ſend ſuch a Preacher as Chriſt was,
ſome againe deſpiſed his doctrine, and
ſaid,<note place="margin">Ioh. 7.</note> 
               <hi>he had a deuill.</hi> Theſe words
the people then ſpake of Chriſt, theſe
words, I ſay, they ſpake of Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.
<pb facs="tcp:3344:10"/>
He was called <hi>a Samaritane,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 7.</note> 
               <hi>a
wine-bibber, a friend of publicans and
ſinners, a ſeducer of the people.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
it is the leſſe maruaile if ſuch
words be now at theſe dayes ſpoken,
as were ſpoken in the beginning of
the Church; if ſuch words be ſpoken
againſt vs, as were ſpoken againſt
Chriſt himſelfe. But S. <hi>Paul</hi> hath here
giuen vs a rule, whereby to know the
true ſeruants of Chriſt, and Stewards
of Gods ſecrets. Chriſt was the true
Prophet, and why ſo? becauſe he prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
his fathers will.<note place="margin">Ioh. 15.</note> 
               <hi>What euer I haue
heard of my Father,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>the
ſame haue I declared vnto you.</hi> Saint
<hi>Paul</hi> was the true ſeruant of Chriſt,
and ſteward of his ſecrets, and why
ſo? becauſe he labored in Gods vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard,
he preached, he taught, more than
all the reſt of the Apoſtles of Chriſt did,
<hi>Laboraui plus quàm, caeteri omnes.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 15.</note> 
               <hi>I haue
labored more than all the reſt of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
haue done.</hi> Therefore was he
the true and faithful miniſter of Gods
myſteries, becauſe he thus diligently
alwaies taught Gods Goſpell, and the
<pb facs="tcp:3344:11"/>
glorie of his name: for this cauſe I ſay,
and none other, was he the Steward
and diſpenſer of Gods ſecrets. So
were the Patriarches, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
the true ſeruants of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they declared the will of God.
And here haue we to conſider, that
Chriſt which was the true Prophet,
the Apoſtles which were the ture Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
and Stewards of Chriſt, the
Patriarches &amp; Prophets, which were
the true and faithfull ſeruants of God,
were all greeuouſly afflicted, perſecuted
from place vnto place, and laſtly put to
moſt cruell death. This I ſay, hapned
to Chriſt himſelf, and all his Apoſtles,
S. <hi>Iohn</hi> the Euangeliſt only excepted.
And yet was Chriſt Gods own ſonne,
the Apoſtles were the true Miniſters
and Stewards of Gods ſecrets. And
therefore if we ſhall in our time ſée the
Preachers of Gods word afflicted, the
Teachers of the Goſpell of Chriſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted,
the Stewards of Gods ſecrets
miſerably tormented, yet let not vs
(good Bretheren) let not vs giue ouer
and ſhrink from Gods goſpell, let vs
<pb facs="tcp:3344:11"/>
conſider that this is no new thing, no
ſtrange hap, but ſuch as hapned to
the Patriarches, to the Prophets, to
the Apoſtles, yea, and to Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Now then, let vs take this rule of
S. <hi>Pauls,</hi> and thereby let vs trie whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Preachers in times paſt, the
Popes, the Cardinals, the Biſhops,
were the true ſeruants of God, Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
and diſpenſers of his holie ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets.
There are at this day ſome that
be called Biſhops, ſome that be called
Cardinals, &amp; they ſay that they carry
vp the Church of Chriſt, and are the
props &amp; pillers of the ſame: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in token therof they haue alwaies
pillers borne before them. At this day
the Biſhop of Rome calleth himſelfe a
generall Biſhop, an vniuerſal Biſhop,
not ouer this part, or that part, but
ouer all Chriſtendome; yea, &amp; he ſaith,
he is the head of Chriſts Church: he
ſaith that he hath power ouer Kings,
ouer Princes, he hath power ouer pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie,
ouer Soules departed, ouer
Deuils, ouer Angels: he can parden
<pb facs="tcp:3344:12"/>
not only ſinnes alreadie done, but ſuch
alſo as ſhall be at any time hereafter
committed: and that he can not mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake
the Scriptures of God, that he
can not erre, and be deceiued: what
euer he doth, all is well done: no man
can iudge him and ſit vpon his doings.
I ſpeake not this of malice, I ſpeake
it not for any grudge or hatred I owe
to his perſon, God is my witneſſe, I
neyther know him that now is, nor
any of them that haue heretofore time
béen Biſhops of Rome. But all theſe
their doings are written, all theſe
words which I haue here ſpoken, are
written I ſay, euen in their owne
Lawes and Decrées; the places may
be alleaged and brought forth. Alas,
theſe are glorious titles, to be called
vniuerſall Biſhop, and head of Chriſts
Church, to haue dominion ouer Kings
and Princes, to haue power ouer Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie,
ouer Soules departed, ouer
Deuils, ouer Angels, to haue authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
to pardon ſinnes paſt, &amp; ſinnes here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
to be committed, not to erre, not
to be deceiued: all theſe are glorious
<pb facs="tcp:3344:12"/>
and triumphant titles, as you well ſée.
But let vs now take <hi>Pauls</hi> rule, the
rule I ſay that S. <hi>Paul</hi> hath here giuen
vs, and let vs by the ſame trie, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Biſhops, the Cardinals, the
Popes, haue heretofore time, or at this
time, do diſpenſe vnto vs the myſteries
of the Goſpell, as Stewards of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
of God: whether they do preach
&amp; teach the Goſpel of Chriſt, as the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
and Miniſters of Chriſt. Alas,
we ſée they do nothing leſſe, they do,
we ſée, nothing leſſe than ſet forth the
Goſpell of God, &amp; the glory of his holy
name. Now then can they call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
<hi>Paſtores,</hi> when they féede not
Gods ſhéepe? how can they call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
watchmen, when they haue no
regard to Gods flocke? how can they
call themſelues pillers of the Church,
yea, and the head of the Church,
when they ſhew themſelues rather
deſtroyers of the Church of Chriſt,
and not members of the ſame? Alas,
if they be not Gods ſeruants, whoſe
ſeruants are they? if they be not Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſers
&amp; Stewards of Gods ſecrets,
<pb facs="tcp:3344:13"/>
of whoſe ſecrets are they Stewards?
if they be not ſo much as members,
how are they then the Pillers &amp; head
of Chriſts Church?</p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> goeth further and ſaith,
It is not ſufficient to be called Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants,
to be called Miniſters, to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
ſtewards of Gods ſecrets, but it is
<hi>further required at the Stewards hand,
that he be found faithful.</hi> In this world
the Maſter committeth the order of his
houſe to the gouernance of his Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;
the diſpoſing of his whole liuing,
&amp; order of all other things, he commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
only to his Stewards wiſdome: &amp;
he looketh that he be found faithfull in
all his doings. And if this be in worldly
things, if the Maſter here in this world
will look for, &amp; require faithful dealings
at his Stewards hands, in ſuch things
as are but tranſitorie, &amp; of little value:
how much more then will God require
faithfulneſſe in his Stewards, as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
things Eternall, things Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly,
and the diſpoſing of his ſecrets.
But from the beginning, euen from
the firſt beginning of the world, there
<pb facs="tcp:3344:13"/>
haue béen alwayes vntruſtie and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
Stewards. For, at what time
God framed man, and placed him in
Paradiſe in great ioy and pleaſure, the
Deuill enuying this his felicitie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
a wicked Steward, and ſaid vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Adam,</hi> Tuſh, <hi>ye ſhall not dye,</hi>
eate of this fruit,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> ye ſhall not dye,
God doth but mocke with you: <hi>for he
doth know that in what euer houre ye
eate of it, your eyes ſhalbe opened, &amp; ye
ſhall be as God, knowing both good &amp;
euill.</hi> And thus he became a moſt wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
Steward. <hi>Ieremy</hi> alſo the prophet
ſaith, that in his time ther were wicked
and vntruſty Stewards: <hi>Currunt</hi> ſaith
he, <hi>at ego non miſi, loquuntur, at ego non
ſum loquutus illis,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ier. 23.</note> 
               <hi>They run, ſaith God,
but I ſent them not, they haue ſpoken,
but I ſpake not vnto them.</hi> So Chriſt
himſelfe ſaid, that in the later dayes
there ſhould come falſe Stewards,
falſe Prophets, falſe Preachers, and
ſay,<note place="margin">Math. 24<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> 
               <hi>Hic eſt Chriſtus, illic eſt Chriſtus,
<hi>Lo, here is Chriſt, there is Chriſt; and
ſhould do great wonders and tokens,
in ſo much that, if it were poſſible, the
<pb facs="tcp:3344:14"/>
verie choſen ſhould be brought into
error alſo.</hi>
               </hi> Antechriſt in likewiſe ſhall
come ſaith <hi>Paul, The man of ſinne, the
ſonne of perdition,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Theſſ. 2.</note> 
               <hi>he ſhall exalt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
aboue all that is called God, he
ſhall ſit in the holie place, in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God,</hi> in the conſcience of Men:
and when he commeth he ſhall not ſay,
I am Antechriſt, I am a falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
I am a wicked Steward; but he
ſhall rather ſay, I am a true Prophet,
I am a faithful Steward. I am Chriſt
the Sonne of God, yea I am God
himſelfe. Now therefore how will you
know the true ſeruant, from the falſe
Miniſter, how will you trie the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Steward from the vnfaithfull?
Mary, ſaith S. <hi>Paul,</hi> if he doth his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
will and commaundement, if he
doth all thoſe things faithfully that his
Maſter requireth at his hands, if he
this doth, then is he a faithful Miniſter
and a truſtie Steward. By this ſhall
you know him, by this token, &amp; none
other ſhall you ſoone diſcerne, whether
he be a faithfull Steward, this is the
point of a truſty ſeruant. And therfore
<pb facs="tcp:3344:14"/>
God vnto <hi>Ezechiel</hi> his prophet, and ſo
by him to all ſuch as ſhall become his
Stewards &amp; Preachers of his Goſpel,
ſaith,<note place="margin">Ezech. 3.</note> 
               <hi>I haue appointed thee a Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
ouer my houſe of Iſrael, to crie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
my people, therefore take good heed
to the words of my mouth, and giue
them warning at my commandement:
thou ſhalt heare it at my mouth,</hi> ſaith
God, <hi>and then ſhalt thou pronounce it
vnto my people.</hi> So <hi>Paul</hi> was bould to
ſay,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.</note> 
               <hi>Quodaccepi à Domino, tradidi vobis,

Chriſt, all that I teach, all that I

the will of my Father.<note place="margin">Ioh. 7.</note> By this there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
(my Bretheren) ſhall you ſoone trie
whether they are true ſeruants of God:
for if they ſhall only diſcloſe vnto you
the wil of God, if they ſhal preach vnto
you the ſecrets of Gods Goſpell, &amp; the
glory of his holie name, then are they
true ſeruants, then are they Chriſts
miniſters, &amp; faithful diſpenſers of Gods
ſecrets. But if they teach you not the
ſincerity of Gods Goſpel, if they preach
not vnto you the myſteries of Gods
word, if they diſcloſe not vnto you the
will of God, if they do not this; then are
they not Gods ſeruants, then are they
not Chriſts Miniſters, nor Stewards

be content to be iudged by this rule, to
be tried by this only rule that S. <hi>Paul</hi>
here giueth. Theſe are the moſt &amp; the
greateſt controuerſies, wherupon hath
riſen all the contention &amp; variance that
we haue ſéen; whether we ſhould haue
a Communion, or a priuat Maſſe: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Communion ſhould be mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred
vnder both kinds, or not: whether
we ought to haue our Prayers in our
vulgar tongue: whether we ſhold haue
and ſet vp in our Churches any grauen
Images: and whether we may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
haue the Scriptures in our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
tongue, that euery man may read
and vnderſtand them. Theſe are, I
ſay, the controuerſies, whereon han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
all our debate. But now let vs ſée
and conſider, whether ſuch as taught
you to haue a priuate Maſſe: ſuch as
would haue the Communion miniſtred
<pb facs="tcp:3344:16"/>
vnder one kind alone: ſuch as taught
you to worſhip Images: ſuch as would
you to pray in an vnknowen tongue:
ſuch as would not ſuffer you to haue
the knowledge of Gods word and his
goſpell: let vs I ſay, according vnto S.
<hi>Pauls</hi> rule, ſée whether they were the
true Miniſters of Chriſt, &amp; faithful ſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
of the ſecrets of God; let vs
weigh whether they diſcloſed vnto you
the myſteries of Gods word, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
their doctrine agréed with the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Chriſt at his laſt Supper ordeyned a
Communion,<note place="margin">Luk. 22.</note> for the comfort of all our
Soules; but they turned this into a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uat
Maſſe, that one man ſhould receiue
alone. This was contrarie to Chriſt,
contrarie to that he ordeined. And how
then ſhould wée eſteeme them, as the
Miniſters of Chriſt, &amp; Stewards of the
ſecrets of God? Chriſt miniſtred this
Communion to his Diſciples in both
the kinds; yet they notwithſtanding
miniſtred it vnder one kind alone, they
robbed the people, and took the cup from
them. And this was contrary to Chriſt,
<pb facs="tcp:3344:16"/>
&amp; his inſtitution. And how then ſhould
wée eſtéeme them as the miniſters of
Chriſt, &amp; ſtewards of the ſecrets of God?
God gaue vs in commaundement to
make no grauen Image: they taught
that we ſhould make ourſelues grauen
Images, that wee ſhould knéele, that
we ſhould bowe, that we ſhould créepe
vnto them, and that we ſhould offer &amp;
ſticke vp candles before them.</p>
            <p>This they taught to bee neceſſarie
doctrine, and that our ſaluation depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
therupon. This haue they done,
you all right well know, and this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
to the expreſſe commandement
of God. And how then ſhould wee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem
them as the miniſters of Chriſt,
and Stewards of the ſecrets of God?
S. <hi>Paul</hi> willeth our praiers in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
to be ſuch,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 14.</note> to be red and ſong
in ſo plain a tongue, in ſo diſtinct and
knowne a language, that the common
people may vnderſtand them, and ſo
altogether may anſwere the miniſter,
and ſay Amen. And this was vſed in
the Patriarches, in the Prophets, in
the Apoſtles, in the old Doctours
<pb facs="tcp:3344:17"/>
times, in the Primitiue Church: and
yet there haue beene men, and now
are, that would haue the praiers in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,
in a tongue to vs ſtrange and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne,
and in a tongue that few or
none vnderſtand. And how then can
they ſay they are the Miniſters of
Chriſt, &amp; Stewards of Gods ſecrets?
God, in the old Law, gaue in charge
to his people,<note place="margin">Num. 15. Deut. 11.</note> that they ſhould haue his
Law alwaies before their eyes, <hi>that
they ſhould haue his commandements
written in their hands, on their ſleeues,
on their doore threſholds, in the ſkirts
of their garments.</hi> This God himſelfe
commanded. And Chriſt in the new
Law, <hi>Scrutamini Scripturas,</hi> ſaith he,
<hi>illae enim teſtimonium perhibent de me,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 5.</note>
               <hi>Search ye the Scripturs, for they do bear
witneſſe of mee.</hi> And yet this notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
notwithſtanding Chriſt
commaunded vs to ſearth the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turs,
yet you your ſelues haue known
men, and ſuch as were Preachers, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
you to haue Gods Goſpell in your
hands, would not ſuffer you to haue
the holy Teſtament of Chriſt in your
<pb facs="tcp:3344:17"/>
houſes, no nor in the Churches for all
men to read. This was contrarie to
Gods commandement, and the mind
of our ſauiour Ieſus Chriſt. And how
then can they ſay they are the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of Chriſt, &amp; Stewards of Gods
ſecrets? Chriſt ſaid vnto <hi>Peter, Amas
me? paſce oues meos,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 21<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <hi>paſce agnos meos, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
gregem meum: Peter</hi> (ſaid Chriſt) <hi>lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt
thou me? feed my ſheepe, feed my
lambes, feed my flock:</hi> But our great
clearkes, our Popes, our Cardinals,
our Biſhops, would ſeldome or neuer
make a Sermon; they fed not Gods
ſhéepe, they fed not Gods lambs,
they had no regard to Gods flocke:
and how then could they ſay, they
were the Miniſters of Chriſt, and
Stewards of Gods ſecrets? I leaue
out much of purpoſe, good brethren, I
wittingly ouerpaſſe here many things
els, that I could ſay herein; the time
would faile me, if I ſhold reherſe vnto
you al thoſe things wherin they haue
moſt ſhamfully abuſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues. But
iudge you, my brethren, by theſe things
only which I haue here ſhewed vnto
<pb facs="tcp:3344:18"/>
you, whether they ſhould be eſtéemed
as the Miniſters of Chriſt and Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
of the ſecrets of God? Chriſt
willed them not only to be Stewards
but faithfull Stewards, faithfull mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,
faithfull diſpenſers of his
ſecrets. If to do nothing be the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe
that God requireth in them,
if this bee the charge that Chriſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth
of them, then may wee well
call them the ſeruants of God and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
of Chriſt: otherwiſe how can
we ſay, that they are the Stewards of
Gods ſecrets, and faithfull diſpenſers
of his hidden myſteries?</p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> goeth forth and ſaith;
<hi>It is but a ſmall thing that I ſhould be
iudged of you.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
he was an elect veſſel of God,
to beare abroad the glorie of his name,
notwithſtanding hee was the greateſt
of the Apoſtles, and a faithfull diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer
of Gods ſecrets; yet ſome men
ſaid that hée was vnlearned, ſome
ſaid hee was no Miniſter of Chriſts,
ſome ſaid that there were many other
Preachers better than hee. And this
<pb facs="tcp:3344:18"/>
was ſpoken of him euen by the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
and ſuch as profeſſed Gods
name. And thus a great number of
the people iudged that S. <hi>Paul</hi> was
not the ſeruant of God, was not the
Miniſter of Chriſt, was not a Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of Gods ſecrets. But S. <hi>Paule</hi>
appealed from them, he appealed from
their iudgements, and ſaid; <hi>It is but a
ſmal matter for me to be iudged of you,
or of mans daie &amp;c.</hi> Here may wee ſée
what a bold courage, what a ſtout ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke
was in S. <hi>Paul,</hi> when he durſt
thus openly, and as it were, to their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
appeale from the peoples iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and ſo bring them before the
dreadfull maieſtie of the eternall God.
This was a great courage of his, this
was a ſigne that hee little or nothing
feared the force of the people. But this
he did, becauſe he wel knew that what
euer befell him in this world, what
euer puniſhment hee ſuffered in this
life, he could not miſcarie before God,
hée could not doe other than well in
the life to come. And therefore like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
in another place hee bouldly ſaid
<pb facs="tcp:3344:19"/>
vnto the people, <hi>I am pure from the
bloud of all men, I haue kept back no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that was profitable, I haue hid
nothing from you, but haue ſhewed
you all the counſell of God.</hi> And ſo,
where, at this day ſome men there are
which ſay that this Doctrine which is
now preached vnto you, ſhall againe
haue a change, that this Religion ſhall
be taken away and once againe alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that it can not long ſtand &amp; conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new:
to ſuch we boldly anſwere here
as S. <hi>Paule</hi> to the Corinthians did,
that it is but a ſmal matter for vs to be
iudged of you, that we much force not
what you iudge and déeme of vs. For
we haue kept nothing backe from you,
we haue diſcloſed vnto you al the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell
of God. But if ſuch change doth
happen, if any alteration of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
doth chance, as poſſible enough it
is ſo to come to paſſe, yet is it not (good
brethren) a thing to bee reioyced at,
it is not a thing wherat we ſhould tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
and be glad.</p>
            <p>For oftentimes when God ſéeth his
benefits miſuſed, when he perceiueth
<pb facs="tcp:3344:19"/>
his Goſpell little regarded, when hee
eſpieth his holy word neglected and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſet by: then he pulleth from vs
againe his benefits earſt beſtowed,
then he taketh away his word from
out of the congregation, then hee will
not ſuffer the light of his holy Goſpell,
any longer to ſhine vpon them. And
this when he doth, he doth it onely for
our ſinfulneſſe, only for our owne ſins
&amp; wretchedneſſe. For ſo in times paſt
he ſaid by <hi>Oſe</hi> his Prophet; <hi>For the
wickedneſſe of my people I will get me
away, they ſhal not ſee me.</hi> So Chriſt
himſelfe alſo ſaid;<note place="margin">Mat. 21.</note> 
               <hi>Auferetur à vobis reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num
Dei, The kingdom of God ſhalbe
taken from you, &amp; giuen to the heathen
which ſhall bring forth the fruits of it.</hi>
But alas, when Gods kingdom is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away, in whoſe kingdom and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
do the people then liue? when
Gods goſpel &amp; his word is no longer
preached, what learning, what doctrin,
what diſcipline is there left to bee
taught? And this oftentimes commeth
to paſſe by means of our owne ſin and
wickednes: that for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> miſuſing of God
<pb facs="tcp:3344:20"/>
and his goſpel, we neither haue Gods
Kingdome, nor his Goſpell among
vs. But then alas, in what great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie,
in what wretchedneſſe, in what
wofull caſe ſhall wée ſtand? For if
Gods Kingdom be ſhut from vs, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſhal we fly? If the light of his goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
be taken from vs, what light ſhall
be left vs? If God will get him away
from vs, who ſhall bee our ſuccour?
And therefore no man ought to reioice
hereat, no man ought to be glad of ſuch
a change. But though Gods kingdom
be taken away from vs, though Gods
Goſpell bee no more preached vnto vs,
though God fly from vs, and will hide
himſelfe away, yet is God and his
goſpell nothing thereby altered; God
is ſtill one, and the ſame God, his goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
is the ſame goſpell that it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
his Kingdome continueth in one
ſtay and eſtate, it is not changed nor
altered. For ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Caelum &amp; ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra
tranſibunt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 5.</note> 
               <hi>verbum autem meum non
tranſibit: Heauen and earth ſhall periſh,
but may word ſhall not periſh.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
<hi>Portae inferoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> praeualebu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t aduerſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <hi>illud: The gates of hell ſhal not preuaile
againſt it.</hi> And therefore S. <hi>Paul</hi> hauing
on his ſide this word of God, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
changeth, but alwayes continueth
one and the ſame: hauing, I ſay, this
word of his which ſhal neuer periſh, and
againſt which the verie gates of hel ſhal
not preuaile, he was bould to appeale
from the ſlaunderous iudgement of the
people, and ſay, I paſſe not what you
thinke of me, <hi>It is but a ſmall matter for
mee to bee iudged of you, or of mans
day, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Good people, you haue here heard de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
vnto you, and thereby you may
well perceiue, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
hée was the ſeruant of God,
an elect veſſell of the holy Ghoſt, and the
chiefeſt Apoſtle of Chriſt; yet was euill
ſpoken of and miſliked euen of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
and ſuch as profeſſed the name of
God: notwithſtanding he was indéed
the true ſeruant of God, the miniſter of
Chriſt, and a faithfull diſpenſer of the
ſecrets of God, yet could not all men
ſpeake wel of him, al men could not giue
him a good report. And therefore to cauſe
<pb facs="tcp:3344:21"/>
them to conceiue a better opinion of
him, and report of him none other than
he deſerued, he here willeth them, that
they ſhould firſt weigh well and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his doings, they ſhould examine his
doctrine, and the goſpel that he had prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
amongſt them: they ſhould marke
well and ſee whether he had been a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
diſpenſer of the myſteries of Gods
goſpell, and then ſo eſtéeme him, as the
miniſter of Chriſt, and Steward of the
ſecrets of God. And therefore <hi>iudge you
nothing</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>before the time that
the Lord come, which ſhall bring that to
light which is hid in darkneſſe, and open
the counſels of the hearts, and then ſhall
euerie one haue prayſe of God.</hi> And ſo
in theſe daies, as <hi>Paul</hi> in his time was
miſliked of many, ſo I ſay, in theſe our
dayes the miniſters of God, and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
of his goſpell, are euill ſpoken of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
all men: ſome ſay they are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned,
they know nothing, they are
crafts men, they were neuer ſet to ſchool,
this they haue ſaid, and do yet report of
them. Some men ſay, they preach they
cannot tell what, they ſpeake againſt
<pb facs="tcp:3344:21"/>
prayer, againſt faſting, againſt almes
déeds, and all other good works; they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
nothing that good is, they diſallow
in manner all things. This you know
hath béene ſpoken, and yet is reported of
ſuch as now are miniſters in Gods goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell.
But hereunto haue I none other
thing to ſay, than that which S. <hi>Paul</hi> in
this place writeth to the Corinthians,
<hi>It is ſufficient for vs to bee found the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
of God, the miniſters of Chriſt, &amp;
faithfull diſpenſers of Gods ſecrets.</hi> In
the meane ſeaſon doe not you (good bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren)
thinke euill of the preachers of
Gods word, report not amiſſe of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
of Chriſt, account not them your
enemies, that bring vnto you the glad
tidings of the goſpel.<note place="margin">Acts 17<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> When <hi>Paul</hi> came
to Berea from Theſſalonica, and began
there to preach the Goſpell of Chriſt,
the people ranne to their bookes, ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
the Scriptures, conferred his
doctrine with the word of God: and
when they found that in all points it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gréed
therwith, then they beléeued <hi>Paul,</hi>
then they embraced his doctrine, then
with willing harts they claue to his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline.
<pb facs="tcp:3344:22"/>
And as they did, euen ſo let vs
do, good brethren; let vs not iudge raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of Gods miniſters, let vs not ouer
haſtily giue ſentence of them, let vs not
report euill of Gods ſeruants: but let
vs well weigh and conſider what thing
they teach vs, let vs examine &amp; trie their
doctrine with the touch-ſtone of Gods
word: let vs conferre their preaching,
their teaching, their diſcipline, with the
Scriptures of the holy Ghoſt. And this
when you haue done, then bée you our
iudges; then if you ſée that we teach you
nothing but the myſteries of God, if
you perceiue that we onely diſcloſe vnto
you the will of God, if you ſée that wée
preach vnto you none other thing than
the ſecrets of Gods goſpell, eſtéeme vs
to be the ſeruants of God, the miniſters
of Chriſt, and ſtewards of the ſecrets of
God.</p>

with vnſeaſonable weather, ſo that their

that this grace of god, this mercy,

no man righteous for knowing of
his goſpell, but for the kéeping of his
law, for the obſeruing of his goſpell;
though no man indéed be able through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:3344:24"/>
to fulfill and kéepe the ſame.<note place="margin">Iam. 1.</note> S. <hi>Iames</hi>
alſo ſaith, <hi>See that yee bee doers of the
word, and not hearers onely, deceiuing
your owne ſelues. For if any heare the
word and do it not, he is like vnto a man
that beholdeth his bodily face in a glaſſe:
for as ſoone as hee looketh on himſelfe,
hee goeth away and forgetteth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
what his faſhion was. But who
ſo looketh in the perfect law of libertie,
and continueth therein, (if hee bee not a
forgetfull hearer, but a doer of the work)
the ſame ſhall be happie in his deed.</hi> If
ye therfore heare the word of God prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
vnto you, if you know the goſpell
of Chriſt neuer ſo well, if yée dayly and
howerly read and ſtudy the ſame: yet if
you liue not according to the word of
God, if you walke not after the goſpel of
Chriſt, you doe nothing elſe but deceiue
your ſelues, you doe I ſay, nought elſe
but deceiue your owne ſelues. S. <hi>Iohn</hi>

For hereunto are we all called, not only
<pb facs="tcp:3344:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to know Gods way, but alſo to walke
in Gods way: not only to know God &amp;
his name, but alſo to confeſſe God and
praiſe his holy name. Therefore do wée
receiue Chriſts holy Sacraments, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
are we baptiſed, therfore eat we the
Sacrament of Chriſts body, and drinke
his moſt holy blood. But O mercifull
God, how many are there that ſay they
know Gods way, &amp; yet walk not in that
way! how many that ſay they know
their faith &amp; promiſe made in baptiſm, &amp;
yet forſake the ſame! how many that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
the Sacrament of Chriſts body &amp;
blood, &amp; yet co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue in their old ſin &amp; wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe!
But God ſaith, God I ſay,
that cannot lye,<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 2.</note> ſaith, <hi>Qui manet in pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

theſe come vnto thee after the manner of
a great people: yea my people ſit down

<pb facs="tcp:3344:25"/>
haue my word in their mouthes, they

Paul</hi> complaining of the miſliuing of

Gods way, and walketh not in Gods
way, whoſoeuer taketh vpon him to
know God and his goſpell, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects
not his dooings according vnto
Gods will &amp; his holy commandements,
hée doth not confeſſe God, and glorifie
his holy name. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> found

ſaid S. <hi>Paul</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:3344:26"/>
Good brethren, let vs conſider that as
many of vs as ſay, we know gods way,
we know gods word &amp; his goſpel; if ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
follow not, if honeſt conuerſation &amp;
vpright liuing follow not this our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
we ſhame God, and diſhonor his
holy name. <hi>Dicunt ſe noſce Deum,</hi> ſaith
S.<note place="margin">Titus 1.</note> 
               <hi>Paul, ſed factis negant: they ſay they
know God,</hi> ſaith he, they ſay they know
his holy word &amp; goſpel, <hi>but in their deeds
they deny God,</hi> they deny his goſpel. An
horrible thing it is to deny God. The
Turks, the Iews, the Heathen, &amp; Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels,
do not deny God: &amp; yet S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid
that in his time Chriſtian men, ſuch as
profeſſed the name of god, in their déeds
denied god &amp; his goſpel. If thou ſay thou
knoweſt God, if thou ſay thou knoweſt
his goſpell: if thou liue not as God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth
thée, if thou liue not as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth
a profeſſor of Gods goſpell,
thou blaſphemeſt Gods name, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoreſt
his goſpel. <hi>Ore ſuo appropinquant

               <note place="margin">Eſay 29.</note> ſaith God by his prophet <hi>Eſay, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da

draweth nigh vnto mee with their

               <pb facs="tcp:3344:26"/>
me. They honor me with their mouthes
but with their hearts they deny mée.
And in another place God by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith: <hi>O thou man,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 50.</note> 
               <hi>why do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
thou preach my lawes, and takeſt my

thou art ſinfull, with the théefe thou
art a théefe, with the adulterer thou art
an adulterer.</p>
            <p>Therefore, if wee haue the word of
God as a ſong to delight our eares, if we
turne the truth of Gods goſpel into riot
and wantonneſſe, if we confeſſe God
with our lips, &amp; deny him in our déeds,
if we ſay we know Gods law, we know
his commaundements, and yet liue not
thereafter; we do not prayſe God and
confeſſe his name, but we ſhame God,
and diſhonor his holy name: we cauſe
the people to thinke euil of Gods word,
and ſlaunder his goſpell. And this is the
cauſe why the common ſort of people
iudge, that not to be the goſpel, which is
this day preached &amp; taught vnto them;
becauſe ſuch as profeſſe the goſpell, liue
not after the goſpell, becauſe ſuch as ſay
they know Gods way, walke not in
<pb facs="tcp:3344:27"/>
Gods way. And thus through our own
folly, through our owne euill and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
liuing, we offend our brethren, we
offend our ſelues, and ſo in them offend
Ieſus Chriſt: and their bloud ſhall bée
required at our hands. Let vs remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
what God by the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi>
ſaith,<note place="margin">Eſay 39.</note> 
               <hi>Haec eſt vera via, ambulate in ea:
This is the true way, walke in the ſame.
Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaith, <hi>if yee heare Gods

               <hi>thou ſhalt not

Alas, the verie age of the world,
the profeſſion that wee haue taken vpon
vs, is, or ſhould bee ynough to put vs
in remembrance of another life, of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

world to come. Let vs not take the

and extoll God, let our mouthes, our

for euer. <hi>Laetentur &amp; exultent populs, &amp;c.
O let the people reioyce and bee glad,
that thou iudgeſt the folke righteouſly,
&amp; gouerneſt the nations vpon the earth.</hi>
Thy way, O Lord, is knowne, ſaid <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi>
thy way is knowne vpon the earth,
therefore let all people, all nations, yea,
all the whole world reioyce and be glad
thereat.</p>
            <p>Diuers people ſet their minds on di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
things: ſome in conqueſt, ſome in
great power and force of men, ſome in
heapes of money, and treaſures of this
world, ſome others, that they are able
to make other men feare, and they
feare nothing themſelues. But all
theſe things are vaine, both conqueſt,
power, and heapes of great treaſure,
are tranſitorie, and fade away: but
the man of God, that dreadeth God,
and hath a delight in his Law, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
his ioy and delight in thoſe things
<pb facs="tcp:3344:28"/>
which haue no end, but continue for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer.
And therefore <hi>Dauid</hi> here ſaith, <hi>Let
all the people reioice and be glad,</hi> in this
thing alone, <hi>becauſe thou iudgeſt the
folke righteouſly, and gouerneſt the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
vpon the earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let vs conſider if there were a whole
Chriſtian nation brought in captiuitie
vnder the Turke, in thraldom and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection
vnto him, in ſuch ſort that they
ſhould neuer heare the Scriptures, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
receiue the Sacraments, neuer
come to the church to pray, but alwaies
be where God ſhould be deſpiſed, and
his name diſhonored: co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider I ſay with
your ſelues, in what miſerie, in what
wretchedneſſe, in what great thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
ſhould they be. With what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
ſhould they be able to abide this?
But if it would then pleaſe God to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer
them ſtanding in this ſtate, if it
would pleaſe God to reſtore vnto
them his Scriptrues, if it would pleaſe
God that they might receiue againe
his holy Sacraments, and might
come and pray together: if God would
thus much doe for them, O what ioy,
<pb facs="tcp:3344:28"/>
what tryumph, what mirth would they
make! Let vs therfore here conſider the
eſtate of Gods Church before the time
of the Prophet <hi>Dauid,</hi> &amp; as it was in his
time. Before the Raigne of <hi>Dauid,</hi> the
Tabernacle of God was broken,<note place="margin">1. Reg. 5.</note> the
Arke loſt, the Scriptures taken from
them, the Prieſts ſlaine: God made
them no anſwere by Prophet, Angell,
nor by dreame: euery man ran whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
himſelfe beſt liked, without any
feare of God, or dread of his Law: ſo
had <hi>Saul</hi> that wicked King, miſerably
toſſed and turmoyled the ſame. But it
pleaſed God, by the hands of King <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi>
his Prophet, to reſtore againe his
Church ſo ouerthrowne, to her former
eſtate and condition: it pleaſed God by
him to make vp the Tabernacle againe,<note place="margin">2. Reg. 6.</note>
to find out the Arke that before was
loſt, to ſet vp all other things in good
ſtay and order: and this was as much,
as if he had called them from death vnto
life, from bondage to fréedome, from
Hell to Heauen. Therefore when all
theſe things were thus reſtored againe
by the might and power of God, this
<pb facs="tcp:3344:29"/>
prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> comforted his heart,<note place="margin">Pſal. 118.</note> and
ſaid; <hi>Haec eſt dies qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fecit Dominus, laete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur
&amp; exultemus in ea: This is a ioyfull
day which the Lord hath made, let vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce
&amp; be glad therin.</hi> And ſo likewiſe
in another place;<note place="margin">Pſal. 99.</note> 
               <hi>Dominus regnauit, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueatur

(ſaith he) let it be moued &amp; do what
it can againſt God, for God ruleth and
raigneth ouer al. <hi>Zacharie,</hi> when he ſaw
the comfortable time that ſhould enſue
the birth of Chriſt, he fel downe &amp; cried
out, ſaying: <hi>Benedictus Dominus Deus Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 1.</note>

ſo ſoone as he beheld Chriſt, &amp; had
receiued his redéemer into his armes, by

thy ſeruant, O Lord, depart in peace, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to thy word: for mine eyes haue
beholden thy ſaluation, mine eyes haue
<pb facs="tcp:3344:29"/>
ſeene thy Sauiour, whom thou haſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for al people.</hi> Euen ſo in this place
the prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> conſidering the great
mercie that God had ſhewed, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
work that he had then wrought, &amp;
how that in his time al the whole people
knew Gods way, he ſaid; <hi>Laetentur &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ultent

be glad, yea let all the people reioyce, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
thou iudgeſt the folke righteouſly,
&amp; gouerneſt the nations vpon the earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now (good brethren) foraſmuch as we
haue here ſéene &amp; conſidered the ſtate of
Gods Church before <hi>Dauids</hi> time, &amp; the
ſtate wherunto it was reſtored again in
<hi>Dauids</hi> time: Euen ſo let vs in like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
the ſtate of Chriſts Church before
our time, &amp; the ſtate &amp; condition of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame
in our own time, in thoſe daies that we
our ſelues haue ſéen. Let vs co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider how
horrible darkneſſe, what error &amp; confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
hath of late time bin in the Church of
god, let vs weigh &amp; conſider (I ſay) y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
&amp; great abuſes y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> were in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame.
For alas, we had the ſacraments, we had
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy goſpel &amp; word of god, but wee had
them al in vain. Baptiſm we had, but we
<pb facs="tcp:3344:30"/>
knew not the Principles of our faith.
The Sacrament of the body and bloud
of Chriſt wee had, but wee vnderſtood
not why Chriſt left vs this Sacrament,
we knew not why he ſaid; <hi>Take, eate,
this is my body &amp;c.</hi> It is the greateſt
Sacrament, and yet we perceiued not
what it meant. We had Praiers, wee
had Pſalmes, wee had ſupplications
vnto God, and yet we vnderſtood them
not, we vnderſtood no word of them.
Wee worſhipped things made with
mens hands, Images of blockes and
ſtones, ſuch as had eyes and ſaw not,
eares and heard not, neither had any
breath in their mouthes: ſuch things
we worſhipped, and this contrarie to
the expreſſe commandement of God.
The Scriptures were rent, were torne,
were troden vnder foote, were burnt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our eyes. <hi>We groped our way in
the middeſt of the day,</hi> as ſaid the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Ieremie.</hi> And as the ſame Prophet
of his owne time ſpake, ſaying; <hi>Secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum
numerum Ciuitatum tuarum ſunt Dij
tui:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ier. 11.</note>
               <hi>According to the number of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
are thy Gods, O Iuda:</hi> ſo might we
<pb facs="tcp:3344:30"/>
of our owne time haue ſaid. For looke
how many cities we had, ſo many Gods
had wee alſo. Euery Borough, euery
Towne, yea, euery village (in a maner)
had his proper and peculier Saint. It
was then come to paſſe that <hi>Eſaie</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied,<note place="margin">Eſa. 5.</note>
ſaying; <hi>Hell hath opened her
mouth maruellous wide,</hi> Hell hath ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
(ſaith hee) becauſe they haue no
knowledge of God, becauſe they haue
no vnderſtanding. And ſo likewiſe <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pro. 29.</note>
               <hi>When Propheſie faileth, the
people muſt needs be ſcattered.</hi> This
is the word of God, and this is the
miſerie that wee our ſelues haue
ſéene. The old father <hi>Tobie,</hi> when God
had ſtricken him with blindneſſe, and ſo
taken his ſight from him, and therefore
his friends and acquaintance, reſorted
vnto him to comfort him, and ſomwhat,
if they might, eaſe him of his great grief:<note place="margin">Tob. 5.</note>
               <hi>Alas</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>what comfort can I receiue
that cannot ſee the light of the Sunne.</hi>
Thus ſaid he only becauſe he could not
behold the light of this world. Alas,
what comfort then, what ioy, what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation
could wee haue, when God
<pb facs="tcp:3344:31"/>
tooke from vs the knowledge of his goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
the light of his word, yea the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God himſelfe; when euery man
ran whither himſelf beſt liked, &amp; folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that way which pleaſed his owne
phanſie. Therefore were wee caried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
therefore were we led into errour,
therfore loſt we the knowledge of God,
becauſe propheſie failed, becauſe Gods
word was not taught and preached vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
vs. But now it hath pleaſed God to
reueale himſelfe vnto vs, now we know
what is what, now can we diſcerne light
from darkneſſe, good from bad; now we
vnderſtand &amp; know this, I ſay. Now
we haue the Scriptures in our mother
tongue, that euery man may read and
vnderſtand them: the ſame Scriptures
that Chriſt hath ſealed with his owne
bloud. And theſe Scriptures <hi>Ieremie</hi>
that old father calleth, <hi>The prop of
our Faith.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 5.</note> So Chriſt himſelfe; <hi>Illae ſunt
quae teſtimonium perhibent de me: They
beare witneſſe of me,</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) and
they ſhall lead you into al truth. <hi>Hillary</hi>
ſaith; <hi>The Scriptures are the ſquire and
Rule of our life.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 5.</note> 
               <hi>In the Scriptures</hi> (ſaith
<pb facs="tcp:3344:31"/>
Chriſt) <hi>you ſhall find euerlaſting life.</hi>
And <hi>Paule</hi> writing vnto the Romains,
ſaith;<note place="margin">Rom. 1.</note> 
               <hi>The Goſpell of Chriſt is the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of God, to ſaue all that beleeue ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
The Scriptures were written
(ſaith he) that we thereby ſhould know
our ſaluation. All theſe things God hath
now reſtored vnto vs. Now are wee
able to know our profeſſion, now are
we able to know our Religion, to know
God, to know Chriſt, to knowe our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.
Now haue wee the vſe of the
Primitiue Church, the Communion
vnder both kinds: now haue wee our
praiers in our knowne tongue, as in the
Apoſtles time, as in the old Fathers and
Doctors times they were vſed: <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
that old Doctour ſpeaking of his
time; <hi>We come together</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and
hear the Scripturs read vnto vs.</hi> We may
now do, as S. <hi>Baſil</hi> writeth the people
in his time did: <hi>Sonus viroru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, mulieru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp;
paruuloru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in orationibus claugore<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> edit, ta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
fluctus ferientes littora: The ſound</hi> (ſaith
he) <hi>of men, women, and children pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
together, maketh a noyſe like the
waues of the Sea beating on the ſhore.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:3344:32"/>
Thus ſaith that old father, they did in
his time, and thus may you now do.
Now may we ſay, as <hi>Athanaſius</hi> ſaid;
<hi>If I be deceiued, thou haſt deceiued me,
O Lord.</hi> For thy word is plaine, thy
Goſpell is true, and therefore if we be
now deceiued, it is thy word, it is thy
Goſpell, that deceiueth vs: God hath
ſo plainly ſhewed vnto vs the light of
his Goſpel, the knowledge of his word.
Therfore haue we moſt iuſt cauſe to ſay
with the prophet <hi>Dauid: Laetentur &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ultent
populi, Let the people reioyce &amp; be
glad.</hi> And therfore let vs not be vnkind,
let vs not be vnthankful, let vs ſay; <hi>thou
O Lord, iudgeſt the folk righteouſly, &amp;
gouerneſt the Nations vpon the earth.</hi>
Thou haſt now reſtored vnto vs our
praiers in our known tongue, thy ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
as they were vſed in the Apoſtls
time, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Primitiue Church; in the old
Fathers &amp; Doctors times. And let vs ſay
with <hi>Zachary</hi> that holy father; <hi>Benedictus
Dominus Deus Iſrael, Bleſſed is the Lord
God of Iſrael.</hi> Let vs ſay with <hi>Dauid;

all his members to be crucified for

all our member to ſerue and pleaſe him
in holyneſſe and vpright lyuing all the
<pb facs="tcp:3344:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>
dayes of our liues. And therefore ſaith
ſ. <hi>Paul</hi> here, Ye haue now betaken your
ſelues vnto Chriſt; therefore let your
conuerſation be according, liue as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth
the ſeruants of Chriſt: <hi>For
euen as before this time,</hi> ye gaue ouer
your members to vncleanneſſe, from one

your members to the ſeruice of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe.</p>
            <p>And ſuch (good Bretheren) was the
life of all Chriſtian men, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of Gods Church: ſuch was, I ſay,
their life &amp; lyuing. They ſubdued their
fleſh, they mortified their members, and
gaue them ouer wholy vnto Chriſt, and
ſo made them members vnto righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
When Chriſt walked here on this
earth, &amp; was conuerſant in our fleſh, and
this nature of ours; at what time he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
into the houſe of <hi>Zacheus,</hi> which
was a Ruler of the Publicans, &amp; deſired
to ſée Ieſus, by and by <hi>Zacheus</hi> was
turned into a new man, and by and by
he ſtoode forth, and ſaid vnto the Lord:
<hi>Behold Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 19.</note> 
               <hi>the halfe of my goods I
giue vnto the poore, and if I haue defrau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb facs="tcp:3344:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>
any man, I reſtore him foure fold.</hi>
Thus was he only by the preſence of
Chriſt, turned into a new man, thus
he of an vncircumciſed Publican was
made the child of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and wretched creature, he became
forthwith a Chriſtian. And ſo in like,
when Chriſt had but once called vnto
<hi>Mathew,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Math. 9.</note> and bad him follow him, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
he left the Toll-gathering, he
left the receipt of the cuſtome, he left his
owne proper game and profit, and ran
after Chriſt. Of ſuch force was the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of Chriſt vnto <hi>Zacheus,</hi> of ſuch
power was the commaundement of
Chriſt, with <hi>Mathew</hi> the Toll-gatherer.
Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> a little before he retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
vnto Chriſt, &amp; embraced his trueth,
he feared, he trembled, and alwaies ſtood
in doubt: but ſo ſoone as Chriſt had once
inſpired him with his holie ſpirit, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed
his trueth vnto him, forthwith
without any further doubt or delay, he
renounced his errors, and became a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Chriſtian. There was once a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
man, whoſe name was <hi>Euſebius,</hi>
and being demaunded what he was,
<pb facs="tcp:3344:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>
anſwered, a Chriſtian: being aſked what
countrey man, ſaid, a Chriſtian: who
was his father, a Chriſtian: where he
dwelt, a Chriſtian: and ſo to ech other
demaund, he anſwered a Chriſtian: as
who would ſay, what ſo euer I be, I am
nothing elſe but a Chriſtian. In the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of Gods Church, all good men
were called Chriſtian men: and yet was
it not one thing to be a Chriſtian, and a
good man. The Chriſtian men, for that
they conſidered they were called to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,
to redemption by the death of
Chriſt, &amp; to the inheritance of Heauen,
they had their delight and only felicitie
in heauenly things: they eſtéemed not
the vaine pleaſures of this world: and
becauſe they thus carried Chriſt in their
Bodies, becauſe they had their mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
crucified vnto Chriſt, therfore were
they called Chriſtians. And ſo ſhould
we doe, (good Bretheren) ſo ſhould we
conſider our redemption, ſo ſhould we
mortifie our members, and renouncing
the vaine delights of this world, we
ſhould fixe our eyes, our minds, and all
our doings on Heauenly things alone.
<pb facs="tcp:3344:40"/>
Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſaith, <hi>The people come
to learne the Goſpell, to heare the word
of God; and wherefore? that they might
worke according vnto the Goſpell,</hi> that
they might bring forth fruits worthie
the word of God: that they may thus
doo, therfore they heare Gods word, ſaith
S. <hi>Cyprian.</hi> And thus if wée do not,
what euer we brag of our Redemption,
what euer we brag of our profeſſion,
what euer we boaſt of the knowledge of
Gods Goſpell, it is to no end, it is not
to effect or purpoſe. And therefore if we
haue heretofore time giuen ouer our
members vnto vncleanneſſe, from one
wickedneſſe vnto an other, now let vs
giue ouer the ſame our members vnto
the ſeruice of righteouſneſſe.</p>
            <p>For, ſaith S. <hi>Paul, What profit, what
fruit had ye at that time in thoſe things,
whereof you are now aſhamed? for the
end of ſuch things is death.</hi> It is the
part of a wiſe man, and the office of a
diſcréet man, in ſuch good order to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
all his buſineſſe, and to bring all
his doings to ſo good end, that he take
no foile, nor haue any ſhame therefore.
<pb facs="tcp:3344:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Ye haue committed ſin (ſaith ſaint <hi>Paul</hi>)
yée haue giuen ouer your members from
one wickedneſſe to another, and now ye
be aſhamed, now are ye ſorie for thoſe
your miſdoings: But what profit then
had yee of thoſe things, whereof you
are now aſhamed? This is an hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
and the greateſt horrour that may

(good brethren) a wicked conſcience e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermore

they a number of Superſtitious cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of their owne deuiſing, which
here were too long to be ſpoken of. And
all this did they of blindneſſe, thinking
they had done well, meaning nothing
but good therein. But afterwards when
it pleaſed God to ſhew them their owne
blindneſſe, to ſhew them their folly, to
ſhew them the wickedneſſe they wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
in: then were they aſhamed of their
doings, then (I ſay) they were aſhamed

When the people of <hi>Babilon</hi> ſaw &amp;

their God Bell &amp; their Dragon, &amp; that

in like, when the Iewes ſaw before their

their braſen Serpent broken &amp; ground

then were they ſorie and aſhamed of
their former doings. Thus ſaith the

Thus might the Prophets
haue ſaid to the Gentiles, what profit
had you of your gods, the Sun and the
Moone, what profit had you of them,
wherof yée are now aſhamed? So might
<hi>Moyſes</hi> haue ſaid to the children of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,
what profit had yée in this golden
calfe? So <hi>Ezechias,</hi> what profit had yée
in this braſen ſerpent, of which now yée
are aſhamed? Euen thus <hi>Eſay</hi> might
likewiſe haue ſaid, what profit had yée in
your calends, &amp; new Moones, in your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
daies and ſacrifices? And ſo other the
Prophets might well haue ſaid, what
profit had ye in your dreames, in your
ſpider cobbes, in your droſſe, in your
chaffe? what commoditie had yee of all
theſe things? Alas ye are now aſhamed
of them, &amp; therefore yee had no profit of
them, yée had no pleaſure by them, they
brought you no commoditie, they
brought you only ſhame and confuſion.</p>
            <p>Thus (good brethren) let vs weigh
and conſider, what profit wée had in
times paſt of thoſe things, of which wée
are now aſhamed. And let vs conſider
how much we are beholden to god, that
<pb facs="tcp:3344:46"/>
now may ſée and know our owne folly
and ignorance, and ſo bée aſhamed. But
herein, good brethren, there néeds not
many words: for there is no man ſo
blind, but may well ſée, no man ſo deafe,
but may well heare, no man ſo dull, but
may wel perceiue and vnderſtand, the
great errour, the great blindneſſe, the
great darkneſſe, that we haue béene in.
And therefore let vs all now giue God
thankes, that hee hath reſtored his light
vnto vs, and taken that great error and
darkneſſe from vs. Loth I am here to
ſpeake of thoſe things whereof we may
be aſhamed: loth and ſory I am to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat
that vnto you, wherof we are now
aſhamed: but this place now requireth
the ſame, this time and place willeth me
ſomewhat to ſpeake thereof. The time
hath béene, that we haue put our truſt
in pardons, in Buls of the Popes, in
vaine ſcrolles, and writings of his; yea,
and in them wée haue had greater hope
and affiance, than in the death of Chriſt,
and merits of his paſſion. We haue fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
downe before images, before ſtocks,
and ſtones, ſuch as had eyes, and ſaw
<pb facs="tcp:3344:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not, eares, and heard not: before them
we prayed, before them we knéeled, and
ſtacke vp candles. But now we are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed
of them, we all are, I thinke,
now ſory and aſhamed of this our folly:
but what profit had we then of all theſe
things. Sometime wee prayed in a
ſtrange tongue, in a tongue that we vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
not: we prayed contrarie to the
vſe that was in the Patriarchs times,
in the Prophets times, in the Apoſtles
times: but then what profit had wee
of thoſe prayers, whereof we are now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed?
We haue ſéene lawfull marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
forbidden, and mens lawfull wiues
taken from them: and yet the vſe of a
concubine graunted, as though God
were diſpleaſed with marriage, &amp; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
with whooredome: but what profit
had yée then of that thing, of which yée
are now aſhamed? We had Baptiſme,
but we vnderſtood not the principles of
our faith: &amp; euen as the Prophet ſpake
of his time, <hi>Qualis populus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Oſe 4.</note> 
               <hi>talis Sacerdos,
<hi>the Prieſt is become like the people:</hi>
               </hi> ſo
might wee well haue ſaid of our owne
time; blind were they both, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:3344:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>
both fell into the dike. This we are
now aſhamed of, but what profit had
we then therby?<note place="margin">Ier. 5.</note> 
               <hi>The Prophets</hi> (ſaid <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy)
teach falſly, and the Prieſts follow
them, &amp; my people hath pleaſure there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</hi>
And lo, euen this ſame which the
Prophet <hi>Ieremie</hi> ſaid, the Prieſts and
Prophets did in his time, we our ſelues
haue ſéene done in our dayes, and now
we are aſhamed thereof: but what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
had we then by it? We had the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
of Chriſts bodie, but we knew
not why Chriſt inſtituted the ſame, wée
knew not why Chriſt left vs that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament;
wée did all things contrary to
Chriſts inſtitution. Chriſt ordained a
Communion, but wée had a priuat
Maſſe: Chriſt ordained, that the whole
people ſhould receiue in both kinds, but
wée miniſtred it vnder one kind alone:
Chriſt, when hée inſtituted this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ſpake in the common tongue that
all might vnderſtand him: but wée
contrarie to Chriſt, contrarie to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
contrarie to the primitiue
Church, conſecrated the ſame in an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne
tongue, that no man might
<pb facs="tcp:3344:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>
vnderſtand vs. And hereof are we now
aſhamed, but what profit had we then
thereby? We haue knowne this to bée
taught, that the bread in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was turned into the verie bodie
and blood of Chriſt our Sauiour: this
we al know, and do yet remember. But
Chriſt, when hee ſaid, the Sacrament
ſhould bee turned, meant not that the
bread ſhould bée turned into his bodie,
but that we which receiue the ſame ſhold
be turned, that we, I ſay, ſhould be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
&amp; made one body with him. This
was the meaning, this I ſay, was the
meaning of our Sauiour Chriſt. And
therfore S. <hi>Paul,</hi>

the bread which we breake is the partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation

we haue béene otherwiſe
<pb facs="tcp:3344:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>
taught, let vs, I ſay, beléeue theſe holy
Doctors, let vs credit them; they wil not
mocke vs, they will not deceiue nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile
vs. But this other doctrine, this
doctrine of tranſubſtantiation, was of
late deuiſed, not paſt thrée hundred
yeres agoe, in the councell of Laterane.
And there, vpon this new deuiſe of
theirs, they made a great ſolemne, and
feſtiuall day, and called it, <hi>Corpus Chriſti</hi>
day. And now we are aſhamed of this:
but then what commoditie, what profit
had we thereof? We found out of our
ſelues a new ſacrifice, the ſacrifice (I
mean) of the maſſe, as though the death
of Chriſt had not béene a ſacrifice ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
as though Chriſts blood had not
once for al waſhed away our iniquities,
as though Chriſt had not ſaid, <hi>I haue
paid the ranſome for your ſins.</hi> It were
an infinit labor to repeat vnto you par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly,
all the abuſes of late dayes v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in the Church of Chriſt; you your
ſelues can well remember them, I néed
not here to rehearſe them vnto you. But
then what profit had ye of al ſuch things
of which you are now aſhamed? But
<pb facs="tcp:3344:49"/>
ſome men there bee peraduenture, that
wil not be aſhamed of theſe abuſes, but
alwaies vphold &amp; maintain the ſame: &amp;
ſuch if there be any, they are like them
whom <hi>Ieremie</hi> propheſied of, ſaying:
<hi>Thou haſt taken an harlots countenance
thou haſt gotten thee a whores forehead,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ier. 3.</note>
               <hi>and canſt not be aſhamed:</hi> they are like
them alſo whom <hi>Eſay</hi> the Prophet ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
of, &amp; ſaith, <hi>Malice hath made you
blind, you barke againſt the truth.</hi> This
is the ſin that neuer will bée forgiuen,
this is ſo great an offence, that it wil ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
be pardoned. Therefore let vs, to
whom God hath giuen eyes to ſée, eares
to heare, &amp; harts of vnderſtanding: let
vs I ſay, conſider that it is no ſhame to
confeſſe our errors, to acknowledge our
blindneſſe; but ſhame it is to continue in
error, too much ſhame it is to remaine ſtil
in blindneſſe. And ſuch as will not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed
of their euill, but laugh at and
ſcorne others, that are ſory and aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
may well bée likened vnto them
whom ſaint <hi>Paul</hi> writing to the Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians
ſpeaketh of,<note place="margin">Eph. 4.</note> 
               <hi>They being

And ſuch are giuen ouer <hi>in reprobum ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum,</hi>

               <hi>They caſt
their eies downe to the ground.</hi> For ſuch
as wilfully offend, and wittingly caſt

<hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Finis illorum mors eſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 6.</note> 
               <hi>their end

of,<note place="margin">Math. 12.</note> which neither <hi>ſhall be forgiuen
in this world, nor in the world to come.</hi>
Wherefore were they caſt into hel, that
now lye therein? for what cauſe conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
they in thoſe endleſſe tormentes?
becauſe they would not acknowledge
their errors, becauſe they would not be
aſhamed of their owne folly. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is there in hell, fire vnquenchable,
torments ſuch as cannot be thought, vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
darkeneſſe, and eternall death, but
onely to puniſh ſuch as wilfully liue in

               <hi>They

ſhalbe weeping &amp; gnaſhing of teeth, into
<pb facs="tcp:3344:50"/>
fire that neuer ſhall be quenched, where
the worme of the conſcience neuer dieth.</hi>
If we delight in couetouſneſſe, in adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
in fornication and filthy liuing, the
end, let vs ſay, is death, the end thereof
is none other than eternall death.<note place="margin">Pſal. 15.</note>

O mercifull God, who walketh now

            <p>And ſhall we then liue thus? ſhal we

Let vs conſider, that we are fleſh

So he vſeth two maner

                  <hi>Impinguatus &amp; incraſsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus

fat and luſtie: they haue forſaken mee
the well of life, and digged themſelues
pits, yea vile and broken pits that can
hold no water.</hi> Such a thing is the feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie
and pleaſure of this world, that it
maketh vs ſoone to forget God, and the
felicitie of the world to come. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God ſo often warned his people of
Iſrael,<note place="margin">Deut. 8. 11.</note> that when they were once come
into the land of Canaan, into that plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
<pb facs="tcp:3344:54"/>
country which flowed with milke
and hony, wherein ſhould bee no dearth
nor ſcarceneſſe: that then they ſhold not
forget the Lord their god, that then their
hearts ſhould not be deceiued, that then
they ſhould not goe aſide, and ſerue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

waxe hote vpon them. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when faire promiſes &amp; louing kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
cannot win vs to God, then vſeth
he another way, then doth he appoint a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
meane, then beginneth hee to
threaten and feare vs, and that of his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
and iuſtice. And thus did hée to
our firſt father <hi>Adam:</hi> becauſe he would
not he ſhould tranſgreſſe his commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement,
he threatned him,<note place="margin">Gen. 2.</note> and ſaid; <hi>
                  <hi>In
quocunque die comederis ex hoc fructu,
mortem morieris,</hi> In what-euer day thou
ſhalt taſt of this fruit, thou ſhalt dye the

               <hi>Vnleſſe ye giue eare to the voice of the

and ordinances, curſed ſhall you
be in the towne, and curſed in the field,
curſed ſhall thy baſket be and thy ſtore,
<pb facs="tcp:3344:55"/>
curſed ſhalbe the fruit of thy body &amp; the
fruit of thy land, curſed ſhalt thou bee in
thy comming in, &amp; in thy going out.</hi>
You ſhall call, and I will not heare, you
ſhall cry vnto me, and I will not giue
eare.<note place="margin">Leuit. 26.</note> 
               <hi>
                  <hi>Dabo vobis caelum aeneum, &amp; terram
ferreum,</hi> The heauen ſhall be as braſſe,
and the earth as Iron;</hi> the heauens ſhall
giue you no raine, the earth ſhall bring
you forth no fruit, your trauell and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
ſhal be loſt, your land ſhal not giue
her encreaſe. Thus almightie God
threatned his elect &amp; choſen people, and
all to kéep them in awe and feare of him.
And ſo in another place he ſaith;<note place="margin">Leuit. 26.</note> 
               <hi>I will
ſet my face againſt you, and ye ſhall bee
ſlaine before your enemies, and they that
hate you ſhall haue dominion ouer you,
&amp; ye ſhal fly when no man chaſeth you.</hi>
Thus you ſee, that it pleaſeth almightie
God oftentimes to vſe theſe and ſuch
like words of threatning, to vſe ſuch ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour,
to beat a terrour into his people,
when faire promiſes and ſwéet words
can doe nothing; and this doth hee of
his great iuſtice. And therfore <hi>Dauid</hi> in
this place; <hi>God is indeed,</hi> (ſaith he)
<pb facs="tcp:3344:55"/>
               <hi>a rightfull iudge, and God is euer threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
If men will not turne, he hath whet
his ſword, and hath bent his bowe and
made it readie: He hath prepared him
the weapons of death, and ordained his
arrowes to deſtroy.</hi> So mightie, ſo om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent
is God, that hee can puniſh,
and ſo righteous a iudge is he, that hee
will puniſh when it beſt pleaſeth him.
But ſome man would here peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ſay, if God be thus able to puniſh,
and will indéed puniſh when hee is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended,
why then doth he it not by and
by, why is not he reuenged out of hand?
becauſe (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>he is merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
pacient,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 103.</note> 
               <hi>and of long ſufferance.</hi>
Therefore he procéedeth not to reuenge
his anger, therfore hee haſteth not to
wreake himſelfe on vs, ſo ſoone as wee
offend him, and tranſgreſſe his will:
but tarieth, and maketh long delaies
to ſée whether wée will repent and
returne vnto him. But yet (ſaith
<hi>Dauid,</hi> foraſmuch as hee is abuſed,
for as much as yée haue left and
forſaken him, notwithſtanding he be
mercifull, notwithſtanding he be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb facs="tcp:3344:56"/>
cient and of long ſufferance, <hi>Hee hath
now whet his ſword, he hath bent his
bowe, and made it readie, hee hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
him the weapons of death, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined
his arrowes to deſtroy:</hi> and this
will he doe out of hand, he will make no
longer delay at all. Here muſt wee not
fancie, that God will ſtrike vs with a
ſword of Iron, that he hath a bow bent
and arrowes to deſtroy withall: for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
creature on the earth, what euer it
be, be it neuer ſo vile, neuer ſo ſimple,
neuer ſo weake and abiect, but is able at
Gods commandement to bee an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to plague and puniſh withall. And
therefore conſider what is ſo weake as
water, ſo ſimple as flyes, ſo vile as lice
and frogs: and yet it pleaſed almightie
God, by theſe weake, by theſe ſimple,
by theſe vile things, to puniſh and
ſtrike the Egyptians, yea, and ſo
much therby to plague them, that neuer
before they felt the like, neuer earſt
they heard of the like puniſhment. It
pleaſed God to turne their water into
bloud,<note place="margin">Exod. 7.</note> ſo that in the whole country no
water could be found to drink, no liquor
<pb facs="tcp:3344:56"/>
of water to refreſh their Bodies. This
was a great plague, and yet was this
wrought by want of water, which was
but a weake and ſimple creature. A flye,
you know, is a ſimple thing, a thing of
little ſtrength and no force: yet God ſo
increaſed the number of them, he ſent
ſuch a multitude of Flyes among the
Egiptians,<note place="margin">Exod. 8.</note> that euen in the kings houſe
they fell vpon what euer the king eate
or dranke, fell vpon his meat, fell into
his drinke, and ſo putrified and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the ſame. The Lice wherewith God
in like plagued them, fell not only vpon
the king, and his people, but vpon their
Shéepe, their Dren, their Aſſes, their
Horſes, their Mules, and their whole
heards of Cattell, what euer they were.
The Frogs entered into their houſes,
into the kings Palace, into his hall, his

               </gap>rlor, his chamber, yea, and into his
Bed alſo. Thus it pleaſed God to vſe
againſt the Egiptians theſe ſimple, theſe
baſe, and vile creatures, as his rod, as
his ſcourge, as his ſword of puniſment.
Euery creature, euery thing, whether it
hath life, or no life, when it pleaſeth God
<pb facs="tcp:3344:57"/>
to vſe it, is his ſword, is his rod to ſtrike
withall. The fire that fell from Heauen,
and deſtroyed the two famous Cities,
<hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorra,</hi> &amp; the whole Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
there about, was none other than
the ſword of God.<note place="margin">Gen. 19.</note> Therefore ſaith the
prophet <hi>Dauid,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 104.</note> 
               <hi>The ſpirits of tempeſts
doe his will, the thunder and lightnings
fulfill his commaundement.</hi> And ſo the
ſame prophet, here in this place: now
hath God begun to ſtrike, <hi>Now hath he
whet his ſword, &amp; bent his bow,</hi> ſaith he,
<hi>now hath he prepared his arrowes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy,</hi>
&amp; there is no way now to eſcape his
vengeance, no way to auoyd his puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but only this, to turne vnto him, to
run &amp; ſubmit your ſelues wholy to him.</p>
            <p>Theſe words <hi>Dauid</hi> the prophet (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
perſecuted of his enemies, and beſet
round about of them) ſpake vnto <hi>Saul</hi>
the proud king, and his adherents and
ſouldiers: putting them in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
how they had prouoked &amp; iuſtly
deſerued the vegeance of God, for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting
of his innocent ſoule. And euen
as this prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> ſpake &amp; pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
theſe words vnto <hi>Saul,</hi> &amp; his wicked
<pb facs="tcp:3344:57"/>
companie, to reduce vnto their memorie
the power of God, and the puniſhment
that then hanged ouer their heads: So
may we likewiſe well vſe the ſame in
theſe our dayes, firſt to bring vs in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
that God is a righteous
Iudge; and then to conſider how we
dailie prouoke and deſerue his iuſt
wrath, and ſo at the leaſt for feare of
puniſhment, to be ſorie for our miſdéeds,
and returne vnto him: For if we will
not be conuerted, hée hath whet his
ſword, he hath bent his bow, prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
hym the weapons of death, and
ordeyned his arrowes to deſtroy. But
before we come vnto God, (good Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theren)
before we returne vnto him, we
muſt one come vnto another, we muſt
one turne to another; before we be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
to Chriſt, we muſt be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
vnto our neyghbor, before we be at
one with God, we muſt be at one with
our Chriſtian Brother. This is the
order that God looketh wée ſhould ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue,
this is that rule which Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
vs to kéepe. <hi>Remitte, &amp; remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tetur

ſaith Chriſt. Remember (good Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theren)
remember and marke well theſe
words, Chriſt is the author, Chriſt is
the ſpeaker, Chriſt is the commaunder
hereof. And ſo Chriſt our Sauior in an
other place of his Goſpell,<note place="margin">Math. 5.</note> 
               <hi>When thou

<hi>and there remembreſt that thy Brother

God is contented his honor be deferred,

<pb facs="tcp:3344:58"/>
till thou art at one with him. And
when thou haſt thus done, then come
&amp; there offer thy Sacrifice. This is the
ground of the attonement betwéen God
and vs, this is the token that Chriſt is
reconciled vnto vs, if we be at one with
our neyghbor, if we be reconciled to our
Chriſtian Brother.<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 4.</note> For if we ſhall hate
our Bretheren whom we ſée, if we ſhall
be at debate with our Neyghbors being
daily conuerſant with vs; how can we
loue God whom we ſée not, how can we
agrée with Chriſt, with whom we are
not conuerſant? But to declare further
vnto you, that God accepteth not our
Sacrifices, that he regardeth not our pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions,
that he is not pleaſed with our

not looke vpon <hi>Cayn</hi> and his Offring,
that he would haue no regard to his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice:
and wherefore? becauſe his hart
was full of malice. <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catio

               <hi>Dauid</hi> alſo, <hi>Let their prayers be

art, if thou be not in charitie, wretched

For our Religion is none other but a
Brotherhood knit together in the loue of
God; our profeſſion is none other than
charitie and brotherlie loue towards all
men in our Sauior and Redéemer Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt.<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 4.</note> God is the God of loue,
Chriſt is the Prince of peace, his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
is the Goſpell peace; and we that
are Gods ſeruants, ought to liue in god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
loue, we that are Chriſts bretheren,
<pb facs="tcp:3344:59"/>
ought to liue in Brotherlie peace. We
are all baptized in one water, whereby
we ſhould haue in remembrance, that
we ſhould in loue liue as one together.
Theſe, and ſuch other are, or may be,
ſufficient to bring vs in remembrance
of Brotherlie loue, of faithfull amitie,
and vnfained concord, if we of our ſelues
were not too forgetfull. O how oft ſaid
Chriſt to his Diſciples,<note place="margin">Ioh. 14.</note> 
               <hi>Pacem meam do
vobis, pacem meam relinquo vobis, <hi>I giue

you.</hi>
               </hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 13.</note> By this cogniſance and none other
ſhall men know you to be my Diſciples
ſaith Chriſt, if ye loue together, if ye haue
loue one to an other. He ſaith alſo, <hi>A
new commandment giue I you, that you
loue together, as I haue loued you.</hi> What
a zealous fire, what an earneſt loue had
Chriſt when he praied and ſaid, <hi>O Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 17.</note>
               <hi>cauſe that theſe be one, as thou and
I are one, that like as thou Father art in
me, and I in thee, that they alſo may be
one in vs.</hi> Becauſe ye be few, ſaid Chriſt
to his Diſciples, and in the middeſt
of your enemies, liue you in concord
and peace one with an other, one beare
<pb facs="tcp:3344:60"/>

S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note> 
               <hi>That he which loueth his
Brother, hath fulfilled the whole law.
Let not the Sunne goe downe on thy

               <note place="margin">Eph. 4.</note> ſaith <hi>Paul.</hi> And againe,<note place="margin">Rom. 12.</note> 
               <hi>Reuenge
not, but giue place vnto diſpleaſure;</hi>
wreke not your ſelues, but giue roome to
the wrath of God. <hi>Dauid,</hi> when he was
in moſt extreame perſecution, &amp; his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
laid daily wait for his life, ſéeking
his deſtruction, euen then fell he to moſt
earneſt praier, he ſought not to be reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
but he made his prayer vnto God,
and ſaid,<note place="margin">Pſal. 108.</note> O Lord, they ſpeake euill of
me, they reuile me, they call me Traitor,
they call me all that naught is, but I
haue none other help, but to pray vnto
thée, my only ſuccour is to flie vnto thée.
Thus did that holie prophet <hi>Dauid,</hi> and
ſo did the Chriſtians in the beginning of
Chriſts Church. For <hi>Tertullian,</hi> an old
and holie father, ſaith, <hi>Fratres ſe appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant
&amp; more voluerunt pro muicem, <hi>They
called them ſelues Bretheren,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and
one would not ſticke to dye for an other.</hi>
O what a charitie, what a loue, what
a Brotherly affection was this among
<pb facs="tcp:3344:60"/>
Chriſtians, in the beginning of Gods
Church. Saint <hi>Steuen,</hi> when he was
ſtoned, all his bones cruſht and burſt in
péeces, and his Soule readie to leaue his
bodie, euen then he prayed for his Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentors,
euen then he cried out vnto
God, and ſaid,<note place="margin">Act. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>O Domine, ne ſtatuas illis
peccatum hoc, <hi>Lord, lay not this ſinne to
their charge.</hi>
                  </hi> So that holie father <hi>Nazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anzen,</hi>
when the hangman that moſt
cruelly had tormented him, deſired par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
of him, he méekely anſwered, <hi>Qui
mihi ignouit, ignoſcat tibi <hi>He that hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen
me, the ſame forgiue thee;</hi>
                  </hi> God
hath pardoned mée, and I béeſech him
that he will in like pardon thée. Euen ſo
likewiſe Chriſt, when he hanged on
the Croſſe, when his hands and féete
were nailed to the trée and he in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
of all his woe, euen then he prayed
for his perſecutors, then he deſired his
Father to pardon them, and ſaid,<note place="margin">Luk. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>O Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
ignoſce illis, neſciunt enim quid faciunt,</hi>
Father, forgiue them, for they wote not
what they doe.</hi> This is an example for
vs to follow, thus ought wée to do, as
in the beginning of Chriſts Church,
<pb facs="tcp:3344:61"/>
the Chriſtians did, who called them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeues
Bretheren, and one would dye for
an other: Thus ought we to ſay, as S.
<hi>Steuen</hi> ſaid, Lord, lay not this ſinne to
their charge: thus ſhould we do, as that
holie father <hi>Nazianzene</hi> did, and ſay, He
that hath forgiuen me, the ſame forgiue
thée. And laſtly ſo ought we to pray for
our enemies, as Chriſt did for his perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors,
and ſay, Father forgiue it them,
they wote not what they doe. Thus
ought we to do, if we mind to liue accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to our profeſſion, and if we will be
Chriſtians, as we are called Chriſtians.
We read, written by S. <hi>Luke</hi> in the
Acts of the Apoſtles, that in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
&amp; firſt ſpring of Gods Church, the
whole congregation had one thought,<note place="margin">Act. 4.</note>
one mind, one hart. Such a loue, ſuch
a charitie, ſuch a Chriſtian conformitie
was among them. And in commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Chriſtian charitie, &amp; brotherly loue
one with an other, the prophet <hi>Dauid</hi>
ſaid,<note place="margin">Pſal. 133.</note> 
               <hi>O quàm bonum, &amp; quàm iocundum,
habitare fraires in vnum, <hi>Behold how
good &amp; ioyfull a thing it is Bretheren to
dwell together in vnitie:</hi>
               </hi> He eſtéemed
<pb facs="tcp:3344:61"/>
loue to be ſo great a iewel, he thought
concord and vnitie a thing of ſo great
price, that he could not ſpeake too much
good of it. And therfore he ſayd, <hi>It was
like the oyntment that ran vnto Aarons
beard, and like the dew of Hermon
which fell vpon the hill of Sion, where
the Lord promiſed his bleſſing, and life
for euermore.</hi> But O mercifull God,
vnto what times haſt thou reſerued vs?
where is now the peace giuen, the loue
left by our Sauior Ieſus Chriſt? where
is that charitie that ſhould alwayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
among Chriſtians? Now is the
time, euen now, (good Bretheren) are
the dayes come, which Chriſt himſelfe
propheſied ſhould come,<note place="margin">Math. 24.</note> ſaying, <hi>The
time ſhall be that iniquitie ſhall haue the
vpperchand, and the loue of many ſhall
abate.</hi> Chriſt ſaid, that ſuch a time
ſhould come, and euen now, euen
now, that time and ſeaſon is come vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
vs. So likewiſe Saint <hi>Paul</hi> the
Apoſtle of Chriſt ſaid,<note place="margin">2. Timo. 3.</note> 
               <hi>In the laſt
dayes there ſhall come perilous times,
<hi>Erunt homines ſeipſos amantes,</hi> There
ſhall bem en which ſhal loue them ſelues,
<pb facs="tcp:3344:62"/>
couetous, boaſters, proud, curſed ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,
and ſuch as ſhall be deſpiſers of them
that are good. O ſee</hi> the prophet ſaith,
<hi>Non eſt veritas in terra,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Oſe. 4.</note> 
               <hi>There is no trueth,
no faithfulneſſe in the whole world,</hi> there
is no mercie, no knowledge of God in
the land; but ſwearing, lying, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaughter,
theft, and adulterie. <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie</hi>
alſo the prophet of God, <hi>Frater ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabitur

               <note place="margin">Ier. 9.</note> ſaith he, <hi>One
Brother ſhall hunt and perſecute an other
vnto death:</hi> no man may ſafely truſt his
owne Brother, for one Brother vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myneth
an other, and one neyghbour
beguyleth an other. And all this do we
now ſée, wée, I ſay, in theſe our dayes
do ſée and behold all this. We ſée now
that which <hi>Nazianzen</hi> that old holie
father ſpeaketh of, <hi>Membra Chriſti pug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
inter ſe, <hi>The members of Chriſt are
at ſtrife and variance among them ſelues,</hi>
               </hi>
ſaith he, and euen thoſe members that
Chriſt died for, thoſe members I ſay
that Chriſts blood redéemed, thoſe mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
we now ſée at debate and fighting
together. I ſpeake but in generalitie,
I ſpeake not now in particularitie, I do
<pb facs="tcp:3344:62"/>
not here repeat to your memories our
particular offences, and great crimes,
which to conſider would cauſe any ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
hart to be ſorie, yea, which to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
would enforce the ſtonie hart
to bléed. I do not now rehearſe vnto
you by name any ſuch our offences. O
rip vp your conſciences, deſcend into
your owne harts, ſée whether iniquitie
doth not abound, ſée whether there be
not in theſe our dayes, men, ſuch as are
louers of them ſelues: ſée whether there
be any trueth, any fidelitie vpon the
earth: ſée whether one brother doth not
hunt and perſecute an other vnto death:
and laſtly ſée whether the verie mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Chriſt are not now at debate
and fighting together. <hi>Dauid,</hi> when he
conſidered the great oppreſſion, tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,
and perſecution vſed againſt the
faithfull, in his time, cryed out and
ſaid,<note place="margin">Pſal. 12.</note> 
               <hi>Serua me Deus, quia defecit ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus,
<hi>O ſaue me Lord, for there is not

man telleth lyes to his neighbor, they
do but ſlatter with their lips, and diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb facs="tcp:3344:63"/>
in their hart. Ieremie</hi>
               </hi> the prophet,
when he ſaw the whole multitude of the
people in his dayes forſake God, and
run after their owne affections, euery
man whether his luſt lead him, he cried
out and ſaid,<note place="margin">Ier. 9.</note> 
               <hi>Quis capiti meo dabit aquam,
&amp; occulis meis fontem aquarum, <hi>O who
will giue my head water ynough, and a
well of teares for mine eyes, that I may
bewaile the iniquitie of this people.</hi>
               </hi> And
euen like as <hi>Dauid</hi> in his time, ſo may
the iuſt man ſay now, <hi>Serua me Deus,
quoniam defecit ſanctus, <hi>O Lord helpe,
becauſe there is no holie man left.</hi>
               </hi> Like
as <hi>Ieremie,</hi> ſo may the vertuous bewaile
now the wickedneſſe of theſe our dayes,
and ſay, <hi>O who ſhall poure water into
my head, and giue a fountaine of teares
vnto myne eyes,</hi> that I may bewaile the
wickedneſſe of this people. O Chriſt,
where is now thy new commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
where is now thy cogniſance, thy
badge whereby thy ſeruants are kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen?
where is that peace which thou
leafteſt to thy Diſciples? where is now
that one hart, that one mind, that one
thought, that was in the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:3344:63"/>
in the beginning of thy Church?
But what néed I to ſpeake, what néed
I to ſay any thing, if they would heare
thée, Lord, if they would heare thy
word and Goſpell? O Lord where is
thy ſtrength become? where is that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
that force of thy word, which
<hi>was able to diuide the marrow from the
bone?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 4.</note> What is now become of that
marueilous might of thy word? Thy
word, O Lord, is one, thy Goſpell is
the ſelfe ſame and one, but the harts of
men, the harts of thy people are not
one. But this commeth to paſſe for my
ſinnes, this I ſée well is wrought by
thée, O Lord, for myne owne ſinnes
and offences: for other poore men preach
thy Goſpell, other poore men doe teach
and inſtruct thy people with thy ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
word, and by and by the people
mourne, by and by they are ſorie for
their ſinnes, they repent them of their
wickedneſſe, and turne vnto thée. And
I ſpeake as they doe, I preach the
ſame Goſpell, the ſame word of thine
as they do, and yet I doe ſée no amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
I doe not ſée any one won vnto
<pb facs="tcp:3344:64"/>
thée thorough my teaching. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
my ſinne is the cauſe, myne owne
ſinne and nothing elſe is the cauſe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
thou haſt not thought me a man wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie,
by whom any one loſt ſhéepe ſhould
be conuerted, and brought home vnto
thée. But O thou my Brother, that here
ſtandeſt like an ydoll, thou hoſt eyes to
ſée, and eares to heare, ſeeſt thou not that
God hath his ſword whet, his bow bent,
his arrowes readie to deſtroy? heareſt
thou not how he calleth thee to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance?
Thou doeſt ſée, and heare this,
and yet thou increaſeſt ſinne vpon ſinne,
and ſo heapeſt vp anger and diſpleaſure
againſt the day of wrath. I call God to
witneſſe. I haue vttered vnto you Gods
trueth, I haue preached among you his
holie Goſpell, I haue reuealed vnto you
his diuine word, ſo that none of you all
can excuſe your ſelues by ignorance.
But take you héed to your ſelues, take
good héed, I ſay, my Bretheren, &amp; marke
well what S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Hebr. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Peccantes poſt

<hi>They which wilfully ſinne after
they haue once receiued the knowledge of
<pb facs="tcp:3344:64"/>
the truth, are deſtitute of all mercie: there
remaineth vnto them no more ſacrifice
for their ſins, but a fearefull looking of
iudgement, and violent fire, which ſhall
conſume the aduerſaries.</hi>
               </hi> And this is it
that the Apoſtle ſaith, to bee caſt into a
reprobate ſence. This is the ſin that S.
<hi>Iohn</hi> maketh mencion of, ſaying; <hi>Eſt
peccatum in ſpiritum ſanctum, <hi>there is a ſin
againſt the holy Ghoſt, which ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
be forgiuen in this world, nor in the
world to come.</hi>
               </hi> And for this great ſin,
for this horrible wickedneſſe, good peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
God hath drawne out his ſword,
for this cauſe hath he bent his bow, and
prepared his arrowes to deſtroy.</p>
            <p>Therefore (good brethren) let vs lay
aſide al contention, al ſtrife, and debate,
and let vs looke vp vnto heauen, let vs
caſt our eies thither, where is no rancor,
no diſcord, no ſtrife, no debate: let vs fix
our eyes, our hearts, and our whole
mindes on Ieſus Chriſt, on him I ſay,
who hanging on the croſſe, praid for his
perſecutors, and ſaid; <hi>O father forgiue
them, they wote not what they doe.</hi> Let
vs imagine that wee now behold him,
<pb facs="tcp:3344:65"/>
and that he now ſpreadeth out his arms
vnto vs, and ſaith, O thou ſinfull man
that ſlumbreſt in thy ſins, and ſléepeſt
in thine own wickedneſſe, awake, now
is it time for thee to awake out of thy
ſlumber, to ariſe from thy heauie ſléepe:
remember thou art a Chriſtian man,
conſider thou are a lymbe of my lymbs,
a member of my bodie, the child of God,
and coheire of my fathers kingdome.
You children of men, how long will yée
dwell in your old wickedneſſe? How
long will yée liue in hatered one with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother?
How long will ye continue in
rancour and ſtrife? Shall I ſo forgiue
you as you forgiue your neighbours?
ſhall I ſo pardon you your ſins, as you
pardon your brethren their offences? O
I forgaue thée thy great debt, and wilt
not thou forgiue thy brother that little,
wherein he hath offended thee? I haue
paid his debt, I haue paid the ranſome
for his treſpaſſe, if my bloud be a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
ranſome for the ſame: for that
blouds ſake of myne forgiue him, if
nought els will moue thée, if thou wilt
not for his owne ſake, yet for my ſake
<pb facs="tcp:3344:65"/>
pardon him. Good brethren, wee haue
long enough ſerued the deuil, the prince
of this world, let vs now ſerue God our
maker, and Chriſt our redéemer. We
haue long ynough, yea too long, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
in rancour and malice one with
another: let vs now therfore, if there be
any ſocietie betwéene God and vs, if
there be in vs any loue of Chriſt, if there
bee any feare of Gods wreake and
vengeance, let vs one forgiue another;
let euery man forgiue his Chriſtian
brother, let vs all caſt aſide al rancour,
ſtrife, and debate, and ſo let vs dwell
together in vnitie, in brotherly loue, and
concord.</p>
            <p>This day we haue heard Gods Goſpel
preached vnto vs, this day wee haue
learned out of the word of God, that if
wée be Chriſtians, we ſhould liue like
Chriſtians, if we be the children of God
we ſhould liue as becommeth the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of God, without enuie, without
hatred, without ſtrife or malice. Let vs
therfore now leaue off our old contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
&amp; ſtrife, let vs euen here in this place
one forgiue another, and ſo be reconciled
<pb facs="tcp:3344:66"/>
one vnto another, and ſaie; <hi>Remitte no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis

oribus noſtris, <hi>O Lord forgiue vs our
ſins, as we forgiue them that treſpaſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
vs.</hi>
               </hi> This is our profeſſion, this is
our Religion, hereunto are we called of
God, appointed by Chriſt, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by his holy word. Let vs conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
our white &amp; hore hairs, let vs behold
our riueled ſkinne, let vs haue alwaies
before our eyes the graue whereunto
we are créeping: Let vs conſider that
death daily hangeth ouer our heads.
And ſhall wee then in this ſort liue out
the reſt of our years? Shall wee thus
die, and come to our graues? Let vs
ſhew our ſelues in our workes to be the
children of God, and the brethren of
Chriſt: let vs not ſhew our ſelues Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
in name and not in déed: let vs
not loue in word alone, but in déed and
veritie: let vs not requite euill with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill,
one miſchiefe with another; but let
vs (according vnto S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Rule)<note place="margin">Rom. 12.</note> 
               <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome
euill with good,</hi> hatred with

ſhall God hold backe his ſword, though
<pb facs="tcp:3344:66"/>
alreadie drawne, ſo ſhall he not ſmite vs
though he hath bent his bow, prepared
him the weapons of death, and ordained
his arrowes to deſtroy. But God ſhall
continue our God, and remain with vs
for euer. <hi>Amen.</hi>

witneſſed all the Patriarches and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
euen from the firſt beginning of
the world, vnto the time of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of our Sauior Ieſus Chriſt. And
therfore, becauſe the whole Scriptures,
the Patriarches, the Prophets, ſpake
thus plainely of Chriſt, and declared his
comming. Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Scrutamini Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turas,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 5.</note>
               <hi>illae enim teſtimonium perhibent de

               </hi> Likewiſe againe
to the Scribes and Phariſies, hee ſaid,
<hi>Si Moſei crederetis crederetis &amp; mihi,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 5.</note> 
               <hi>If ye
beleeued Moſes, ye would beleeue mee,
for Moſes alſo hath written to mee;</hi> hee
hath told you of me, ſaid Chriſt, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if you beléeued him, yée would alſo
beléeue me. And thus all the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
of the Scriptures bare record of the
comming of Chriſt: the Patriarches
knew long before that Chriſt ſhould be
borne: the Prophets propheſied of his
comming into the world. But when
<pb facs="tcp:3344:69"/>
Chriſt ſhould be borne, when his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
comming ſhould appeare, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the ſcriptures declared, neither the
holy Patriarches knew, nor the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
were able to ſhew. And therfore
ſaid Chriſt,<note place="margin">Iohn 8.</note> 
               <hi>Abraham voluit videre diem
meum, <hi>Abraham would faine haue ſeene
my day, &amp; he ſaw it, &amp; therefore he reioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.</hi>
               </hi>
But how did <hi>Abraham</hi> ſée it? with
bodily eyes? no, but in faith, &amp; becauſe
he was in faith able to ſée it, therefore he
reioyced. What then if he had with his
eyes ſéene Chriſt, if he had talked with
him, if he might haue touched and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
Chriſt: what ioy would hée haue
made? how would he haue reioyced and
béene glad? No doubt, as the birth of
Chriſt was moſt acceptable and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
to al good men in that time, ſo was
his comming much longed for of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Patriarches and Prophets before
time: for they well knew that his time
ſhould be a time moſt acceptable, that
then all things ſhould be in quietneſſe,
vnitie and concord in euery place, peace
through the whole world. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſaid <hi>Eſay</hi> the Prophet,<note place="margin">Eſa. 9.</note> 
               <hi>Et vocabitur
<pb facs="tcp:3344:69"/>
princeps pacis, <hi>He ſhalbe called the Prince
of peace.</hi>
               </hi> And to declare this more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the ſame Prophet ſaith,<note place="margin">Eſay 11.</note> 
               <hi>Then ſhall
the Wolfe dwell with the Lambe, the
Leopard ſhall lye downe by the Goat,
Bullocks, Lyons, and cattell ſhall keepe
company together, the Cow and the
Beare ſhall lye together: and there ſhall
be no crying, no wayling, no noyſe heard
in the ſtreets.</hi> And therefore this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Eſay</hi> in another place, conſidering
the great ioy, the great felicitie that
Chriſt ſhould bring into the world,
when hée ſhould be borne, cryed out and
ſaid, <hi>Diſrumpe coelos, &amp; deſcende,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eſay 64.</note> 
               <hi>O Lord</hi>
ſaid he, <hi>breake the heauens and come

<hi>Quis viuet, &amp; videbit haec? <hi>O who ſhall
liue to enioy this merueilous felicitie?</hi>
               </hi>
When Chriſt was come into this

his mothers wombe, <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt</hi>
béeing a babe, and in his mothers

<pb facs="tcp:3344:70"/>
he ſprang for ioy, and leapt in his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
wombe. So likewiſe at the birth
of Chriſt, for ioy that the Angels in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
conceiued thereat,<note place="margin">Luk. 2.</note> they ſang <hi>Gloria
in excelſis Deo, &amp; in terra pax hominibus,
<hi>Glorie be to God on high, and in earth
peace vnto men.</hi>
               </hi> After that time whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon</hi>
that holy prophet had in ſpirit per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
the true Meſſias, &amp; Sauior of the

               </hi> Now, euen now that this ſight
is prouided before the face of the whole

now that light is appeared which ſhall
be the light of the Gentiles: Now, O
Lord, ſaid be, let thy ſeruant depart in
peace, I haue lyued long ynough to ſée
thy ſaluation.</p>
            <p>Thus, good brethren, all the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
throughout, the Patriarches, the
Prophets, ſhewed long before vnto vs,
the ioy and felicity that ſhould come vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the whole world, at ſuch time as
<pb facs="tcp:3344:70"/>
Chriſt ſhould be borne. And therefore
to confirme all this that they before had
propheſied of him, Chriſt here ſaid vnto
his diſciples, <hi>Bleſſed are the eyes which
ſee that ye ſee.</hi> Bleſſed are your eies, ſaid
Chriſt, for your eyes haue ſéene Gods
promiſes performed: that promiſe which
he made to <hi>Adam,</hi> ſaying, <hi>The ſeed of

Serpent:</hi> Your eies haue ſéene that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
made vnto <hi>Abraham, The ſeed
wherein all nations ſhall bee bleſſed:</hi>
That promiſe alſo your eyes haue ſéene
performed, which God made vnto <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi>
ſaying: <hi>Of the fruit of thy bodie wil
I ſet vpon thy ſeat:</hi> You haue ſéene, and
do now ſée that <hi>Emanuel,</hi> of whom <hi>Eſay</hi>
propheſied: You, I ſay, haue ſéene that
thing, whereunto all the Patriarches, al
the Prophets, &amp; the whole body of the
Scriptures do beare witneſſe: You do
ſee and behold him, whom <hi>Abraham</hi>
would gladly haue ſéene: You ſée him,
whom <hi>Eſay</hi> calleth <hi>the Prince of peace:</hi>
him, in regard of whom the Prophet
cried out, and ſaid, <hi>O who ſhall liue to
ſee this great ioy?</hi> You ſée him, at whoſe
<pb facs="tcp:3344:71"/>
preſence Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> being
in his mothers wombe, ſprang, &amp; leapt
vp for ioy: him, at whoſe birth the verie
Angels in heauen ſang, <hi>Gloria in excelſis:</hi>
him, whom <hi>Simeon</hi> pronounced to bee
the Sauiour of the world. All this, ſaid
Chriſt, you ſée, you my diſciples, your
eyes do ſée all this, and therefore bleſſed
are your eyes, happy and bleſſed are the
eyes that ſée whiche yée ſée. <hi>In the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 1.</note>
ſaith S. <hi>Paul, God ſpake diuerſly,
and by ſundry meanes vnto his people,
ſometimes by dreames, ſometimes by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation,
ſometimes by propheſies, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
by Angels, and ſometimes by his
owne voice: but now in theſe dayes hee
hath ſent amongſt vs his owne ſonne:</hi> by
him, ſaith he, God hath declared his wil
vnto vs cléerely and plainly, euen by the
mouth of his owne ſon. When S. <hi>Iohn</hi>
the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> baptized Chriſt in the riuer
of Iordan, it pleaſed God the Father to
crye from heauen, and ſay, <hi>Hic eſt meus

               <note place="margin">Luke 3.</note> 
               <hi>ipſum audit, <hi>This is my

               </hi> hearken vnto
his voice, giue eare vnto his doctrine:
for he it is to whom both the law &amp; the
<pb facs="tcp:3344:71"/>

<hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Colloſſ. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Myſterium abſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditum a ſaeculis

the myſterie,</hi> that high myſterie of mans

our Sauiour:</hi> ſo long it hath béene hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
ſaith Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and now it is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
and ſhewed vnto the whole
world by Chriſt. Therefore bleſſed are
your eyes, ſaid Chriſt, yea, bleſſed are
the eyes which ſée that yée ſée, for your
bodily eyes ſee that which the Angels
did lacke, you ſée that which the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arches
and the Prophets neuer ſaw:
you, ſaid Chriſt, you my Diſciples are
bleſſed that ſée me, that heare my goſpel
and beléeue the ſame, and therefore bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
are your eyes, and the eyes which ſée
that you ſée. For otherwiſe the Scribes
ſaw Chriſt as the Apoſtles did, the
Phariſies ſaw him as the Apoſles did,
and yet were they alwaies Scribes and
Phariſies, that is, ſuch as withſtood
Chriſt, and gainſaid his doctrine: <hi>Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas</hi>
ſaw Chriſt as the Apoſtles did,
and yet hée rent his clothes, and ſayd,

that Chriſt was a blaſphemer.<note place="margin">Mar. 14.</note> 
               <hi>Pilat</hi> ſaw
Chriſt as the Apoſtles did, and yet hée

               <hi>Iudas</hi>
ſaw Chriſt as the reſt of his fellows the

Chriſt.<note place="margin">Math. 27.</note> The Souldiers, and ſuch as
hung Chriſt on the croſſe, ſaw Chriſt as
the Apoſtles did, yet were they wicked

we then ſay, that theſe mens eyes were
bleſſed? that the eies of the Scribes and
Phariſies were bleſſed? that <hi>Caiphas</hi>
eyes, <hi>Pilats</hi> eyes, <hi>Iudas</hi> eyes were bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed?
ſhall wee ſay, that the Souldiers
eyes, &amp; the eyes of them that put Chriſt
vnto death, were bleſſed, becauſe they
ſaw Chriſt, &amp; beheld his bodie? O good
brethren, theſe men ſaw Chriſt, and yet
ſaw him not: they ſaw him with their

Apoſtles ſaw him, <hi>to be the verie ſonne
of God:</hi> they ſaw Chriſt as a miſerable
man, but the Apoſtles ſaw him as the
Sauiour of the world. And therefore
<hi>Peter</hi> was bold to ſay,<note place="margin">Math. 16.</note> 
               <hi>Tu es Chriſtus, fili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
Dei viui, <hi>Thou art Chriſt, the ſonne of
the liuing God.</hi>
               </hi> And againe he was in
like able to ſay,<note place="margin">Ioh. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Tu habes verbum ſalutis,
Thou haſt the words of life.</hi> Thus the
Apoſtles ſaw Chriſt, and beléeued him
to be the redéemer of the world, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Chriſt ſaid vnto them, <hi>Bleſſed are
your eyes, and the eies which ſee that you
ſee. For I ſay vnto you, many Kings and
Prophets would faine haue ſeene the
things that you ſee, and could not ſee
them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This promiſe, good brethren, of the
birth of Chriſt, and his comming into
the world, to redéeme mankind, was
made long before, yea, it was promiſed
by God the Father, euen in the firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the world, as I haue already
declared vnto you. And therfore in hope
<pb facs="tcp:3344:73"/>
of the performance of this promiſe, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
a godly man did put his affiance in
Chriſt, and long before his comming
had a fixed truſt in the merits of his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
The Patriarches, the Prophets,
and all ſuch as liued vnder the old law,
had the ſame Law and Teſtament that
wée now haue, they had the ſame do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
the ſame faith, the ſame prayer,
the ſame Sacraments that wee now
haue: wée drinke of Chriſt, and ſo the
Iewes dranke of Chriſt:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Bibebant de pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra,
petra autem erat Chriſtus, <hi>They drank
of the rocke,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Paul, and the
rocke they dranke of was Chriſt.</hi>
               </hi> They
were circumciſed, and ſo are we: for,
ſaith Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Colloſſ. 2.</note> 
               <hi>We alſo are circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
but with circumciſion without hands:</hi>
We are circumciſed, but we are circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed
in heart by the power of the holy
ghoſt. The Patriarches and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
knew well, and beléeued, that by
Chriſt they ſhould be redéemed, that by
his only blood, ſhed on the croſſe all the
world ſhould bee ſaued: but this they
knew, this they ſaw, only by faith, &amp; in
ſpirit, for then was not Chriſt borne: we
<pb facs="tcp:3344:73"/>
haue the lamb of God offered vp for vs,
&amp; ſo had they the ſame lambe offered vp
for them. For S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Apocal. 13</note> 
               <hi>Agnus obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
a principio mundi, <hi>Chriſt was the lambe
offered vp from the beginning of the
world.</hi>
               </hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Pet. 1.</note> And now therefore, foraſmuch as
the Patriarchs, the Prophets, &amp; the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
men in old time, had the ſame <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the ſame doctrine, the ſame faith,
the ſame prayer, the ſame Sacraments
that we haue: foraſmuch as they drank
of Chriſt, as we do: foraſmuch as they
were circumciſed, and ſo are we: foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as they did beléeue that they
ſhould be ſaued by the death of Chriſt,
as we doe, ſhall wee thinke that they
were not bleſſed? that their eyes were
not as happy as ours? that they ſaw
not as much as we do? Shall we think
that <hi>Abraham, Iſaac, Iacob, Ioſeph,</hi> and
diuers other ſuch good men, lackt any
part of their felicitie? Or if they were
bleſſed, why ſaid Chriſt onely to his
Apoſtles, <hi>Bleſſed are the eyes which ſee
that yee ſee?</hi> When our Sauiour Chriſt
ſaid thus, bleſſed are your eyes, and the
eyes which ſée that yée ſée, he meant not
<pb facs="tcp:3344:74"/>
and peculiar bleſſing giuen vnto them
alone, but he ſignified the bleſſing of that
time: as if he ſhould haue ſaid, bleſſed is
this time, bleſſed are the dayes that you
ſée. For there is in times and ſeaſons a
great difference and diuerſitie. Some
one time is bleſſed, another is accurſed.
The time of the wicked king <hi>Manaſſes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">4. Reg. 21.</note>
wherin the Teſtament and law of God
was burnt, <hi>Baals</hi> altars reedified, and
Idols ſet vp, was a miſerable time: this
time, I ſay, of <hi>Manaſſes</hi> raigne, was an
accurſed time.<note place="margin">4. Reg. 23.</note> But the time of <hi>Ioſias,</hi>
wherein the law of God was reſtored
againe, <hi>Baal</hi> caſt out of the Temple, the
Idols pulled downe, and all good orders
againe ſet vp in their former eſtate, was
a bleſſed time, a time moſt happie; and
bleſſed was he that liued to ſée that time.
So likewiſe the time of the birth of
Chriſt was a bleſſed time, and the time
of Antichriſt a time accurſed. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Chriſt oftentimes wept ouer Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,
and ſaid,<note place="margin">Luke 19.</note> 
               <hi>O Ieruſalem, Ieruſalem,
thou that killeſt my Prophets, and ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
them that are ſent vnto thee, O that
thou kneweſt the time of thy viſitation:</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:3344:74"/>
O that thine eyes would once ſée, thine
eares heare, and ſo thou wouldſt know
when God hath ſent his ſonne vnto
thee.<note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Nunc tempus eſt
nobis à ſomnis ſurgere,</hi> Now is the houre
for vs to ariſe from ſleepe. <hi>Nox praeceſſit,
dies autem illuxit,</hi> The night is paſt, and
the day now beginneth to ſhine: <hi>and
therefore in concluſion, he ſaith,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Ecce
nunc tempus acceptabile, <hi>Behold now is
the acceptable time, behold now is the
time of ſaluation.</hi>
               </hi> Theſe were bleſſed
times, theſe were acceptable times, that
Chriſt our Sauiour and S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake
of,<note place="margin">Iohn 12.</note> 
               <hi>Dum habetis lucem, ambulate in luce,
<hi>Whiles you haue light, walke in the light</hi>
               </hi>
ſaith Chriſt, receiue the light, and ſo ſhal
you be the children of light. And ſo that
time was a bleſſed time: becauſe Chriſt
was borne in that time, becauſe the force
and power of the diuell was by Chriſt
then deſtroyed, becauſe the dominion &amp;
kingdome of ſathan was then throwne
downe, therefore was it a bleſſed time.
But as touching the bleſſing of the men
in times long before, men were as bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
as they were then: <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,
<pb facs="tcp:3344:75"/>
Iacob, Ioſeph,</hi> and ſuch other, were as
bleſſed as the Apoſtles. They had the
ſame Chriſt, the ſame Sauiour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>déemer
that the Apoſtles had. For ſaith
S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hebr. 13.</note> 
               <hi>Ieſus Chriſtus, heri, hodie, &amp; ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
<hi>Chriſt, is for yeſterday, this day, and
for euer.</hi>
               </hi> One Chriſt ſerued for all the
world. Otherwiſe moſt miſerable were
we, &amp; in moſt wretched condition were
all ſuch as either now liue, or haue liued
ſithence the time of Chriſt. For we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
ſaw Chriſt in the fleſh, we neuer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
his bodie, wee were neuer conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
with him on the earth. But Chriſt
hath told vs by S. <hi>Thomas,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               <hi>Beati qui non

and haue not ſeene,</hi>
               </hi> bleſſed are they
that ſée not, and yet beléeue. Theſe
things bée for our great comfort. For
although we neuer ſaw Chriſt with our
eyes, though he was neuer conuerſant
with vs, as he was with his Apoſtles,
yet haue wée through him the ſame ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
that the Apoſtles had, wée haue
him our redéemer and Sauiour as they
had him.</p>
            <p>Now let vs compare this ſaying of
<pb facs="tcp:3344:75"/>
Chriſt vnto our ſelues and our time: let
vs ſée whether this that Chriſt then
ſpake to his Diſciples, may not be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of vs, and our time. For thus ought
wée to read Gods word, to this end we
ſhould read the Scriptures of God.
Now therefore, good brethren, let vs
conſider well, and ſée whether the
Church of God hath not béene ſo diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
before our time, yea, and in our
time, that wée may now well ſay, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
are our eyes, and the eyes which
ſée that wée ſée: for many a good and
godly man would ſayne haue ſéene that
wee ſee, and could not ſée it. I will be
ſhort, I will not long trouble you in
this thing, I will not vſe many words
vnto you herein. The errors that haue
beene taught and preached in the
church of Chriſt, haue béene (good bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren)
ſo groſſe, that ſuch as could not
ſée them with their eyes, might haue
felt them euen with their fingers: ſo
horrible, and ſo groſſe were the errors
in the church: ſo were all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded,
and ſcarcely the forme of the
Church left vnto vs. But that this
<pb facs="tcp:3344:76"/>
ſhould ſo come to paſſe, Chriſt himſelfe,
S. <hi>Paul,</hi> S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
long time before gaue warning to
the world, and propheſied it ſhould ſo
be. And euen as they ſpake, ſo hath it
come to paſſe, looke what they ſaid, the
ſame haue we ſéene fulfilled. For Chriſt
himſelfe openly ſhewed, that the time
ſhould come,<note place="margin">Math. 24.</note> 
               <hi>that deſolation ſhould
ſtand in the holy place.</hi> And againe hée
ſaid, <hi>When the ſonne of man ſhall come
to iudge the earth, thinke you that hee
ſhall find any faith vpon the earth?</hi> As if
he ſhould haue ſaid, when he ſhall come
to iudge, there ſhall be no faith on the
earth, no fidelitie and truſt among men,
ſo ſhall all things be confounded, and no
faith ſhal be found. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> likewiſe
ſaith,<note place="margin">2. Theſ. 2.</note> 
               <hi>The time ſhall bee, that Antichriſt
ſhall neſtle himſelfe in the Temple of
God,</hi> in the conſciences of men, in the
place of Chriſt, <hi>and ſhalbe exalted aboue
all that is called God,</hi> or Gods ſeruice.
And he ſaith further,<note place="margin">3. Tim. 4.</note> 
               <hi>Erit tempus cum ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam
doctrinam aſpernentur, <hi>The daies ſhal
come, when men ſhall deſpiſe and caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
all wholeſome doctrine:</hi>
               </hi> the time
<pb facs="tcp:3344:76"/>
ſhall be (ſaith he) that they ſhall not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
this Goſpell that I haue preached,
theſe Epiſtes, and letters which I haue
ſent vnto you, <hi>But they ſhall turne their
eares from the truth, and ſhall bee giuen
vnto fables.</hi> This S. <hi>Paule</hi> aforehand
told vs, and indéed wee haue found his
tale moſt true.<note place="margin">2. Pet. 2.</note> S. <hi>Peter</hi> alſo ſaith; <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt
magiſtri mendatiorum, <hi>There ſhall

               </hi>
likewiſe that Prophet of God,<note place="margin">Dan. 9.</note> long
before the comming of Chriſt, propheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and ſaid, Antechriſt ſhall come, <hi>there
ſhall bee an abhominable deſolation in

the truth ſhall be caſt flat to the ground.</p>
            <p>Now, good brethren, conſider well
with your ſelues, where ſhould this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation
be, which Chriſt ſpake of? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
whom ſhall ſo ſmall faith bee
found? Where ſhould Antechrist neſtle himself? Where should good Doctrine be deſpiſed? where ſhould there be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers and teachers of lyes? Where
ſhold the truth be caſt flat to the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d?
<pb facs="tcp:3344:77"/>
where ſhould all theſe things come to
paſſe? Amongſt the Turkes, the Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins,
the Heathen, the Infidels? a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
ſuch as neuer heard of Chriſt,
nor his Goſpell? ſhould theſe things,
that Chriſt, that S. <hi>Paule,</hi> that S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
that <hi>Daniel</hi> propheſied to come to
paſſe, ſhould they (I ſay) be fulfilled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them? Let not vs deceiue our
ſelues, good brethren, Chriſt ſaid that
deſolation ſhould come into the holy
place, that ſuch as profeſſed God and his
name, ſhould haue little faith. S. <hi>Paule</hi>
ſaid that Antechriſt ſhould ſit in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
place, in the Temple of God: that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
Chriſtians wholſome doctrine
ſhould be deſpiſed, and caſt away: S.
<hi>Peter</hi> alſo, that euen amongſt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors
of Gods Goſpel, ſome there
ſhould be that ſhould preach and teach
lyes: And <hi>Daniel</hi> likewiſe, that in the
Temple Antechriſt ſhould ſit, and there
al truth ſhould be caſt flat to the ground.
And this ſhould not come to paſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Heathen and Infidels, but
in the Church of Chriſt, euen in the very
Church of God. S. <hi>Hillarie,</hi> who was
<pb facs="tcp:3344:77"/>
an old father in the Church, ſaith: <hi>O you
will ſoone deceiue your ſelues if yee truſt
in the wals, know you not that Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt
in the Church?</hi> Let vs not ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
deceiue our ſelues, let not vs, good
brethren, deceiue our ſelues. And here
I pray you conſider with me, how that
God, for our better vnderſtanding, hath
in ſimilitudes opened and ſet forth vnto
vs the ſtate of his Church. For Chriſt
in the Goſpell compareth his Church
vnto a ſhip in the Sea, toſſed and tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
with perilous waues: and what
I pray you, betides vnto a Ship ſo toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in the Sea, if there be no Lodes-man
to ſtir it, or if the Lodes-man doth not
his duetie, Chriſt hath likened his
Church to a vine:<note place="margin">Eſay. 5.</note> and what becomes to
a vine, if it be not ſhred and vnderprop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped?
He doth alſo liken it to a flock of
Shéepe:<note place="margin">Ioh. 10.</note> and what becomes to a flock of
Shéepe, if there bee no Sheepheard to
guid and looke vnto them? And now
therefore conſider with mee, I pray
you, euen from the meane Prieſt, to the
Biſhop of Rome, conſider, I ſay, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they haue done their dueties: which
<pb facs="tcp:3344:78"/>
of them all hath done that which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
in them, which of them hath ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled
that God gaue them in charge to
do. Chriſt to his Diſciples, and in them
to all ſuch as ſhould become Preachers,<note place="margin">Mat. 16.</note>
gaue this Commiſſion, ſaying, <hi>Ite, &amp;
praedicate, <hi>Goe you &amp; Preach:</hi>
               </hi> and what
is he that euer ſaw the biſhop of Rome
in a Pulpit? who hath heard a Cardinal
many times preach? Iudge you then
(my brethren) when ſhall the ſhip come
ſafe to the hauen, if the Lodes-man doth
not his duetie? When ſhall the Vine
bring forth any fruit, if the huſbandman
apply not his diligence to dung, to
ſhred, to vnderprop the ſame? What
ſhall become of the flocke, if the Shéep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard
ſheweth not his induſtry and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
labour amongſt them? Now let vs
conſider a little further, what they were
what ſhould haue bin our Lodes-men:
what they were that ſhould haue plaied
the good huſbands in Gods vineyard:
what they were that ſhould haue looked
to the flock of Chriſt. Here will I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
nothing of my ſelfe, I will not
here vtter vnto you any thing of mine
<pb facs="tcp:3344:78"/>
owne inuention; I will onely ſhew you
the minds of the auncient Doctors in
the Primitiue Church, and the ſayings
of old holy fathers, that haue written
of the Church of God. Saint <hi>Gregory</hi>
ſpeaking of the Church of God, ſaith,
<hi>
                  <hi>Eccleſia Dei, ſi ab vno pendebit, corruet,</hi> If
the Church of God ſhall hang vpon one
man,</hi> if the whole ſway thereof ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
vpon one alone, <hi>that Church muſt
needs fall,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Gregorie.</hi> Now let
vs conſider whither in times paſt it hath
bin ſo in the Church of god, whether we
haue knowne one man to haue called
himſelfe the head of the Church: and if
it ſo be, how can it then be otherwiſe,
but that the ſame Church muſt néeds pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
and fall. Saint <hi>Barnard,</hi> an old
holy father writing of the Biſhops and
Prelates of the Church in his time,
ſaith; <hi>Non ſunt Paſtores, ſed Impoſtores,
non Doctores, ſed Seductores, non Praelati,
ſed Pilati: <hi>They are not</hi>
               </hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard)
good Paſtors and feeders of Gods
flock, but they are impoſtors, ſuch as
deceiue Gods ſheepe, they are not Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,
but they are ſeductours, ſuch as</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:3344:79"/>
lead men out of the right way: <hi>They
are not Prelates, but they are verie
Pilates.</hi> And againe, the ſame Saint
<hi>Barnard,</hi> in the Councell holden at
Rhemes, where he made a Sermon
in the preſence of the Biſhops there
aſſembled, ſaid; <hi>Habemus iam non mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenarios
pro Paſtoribus, neque Lupos pro
mercenarijs, ſed in loco Luporum; Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mones
habemus, <hi>Wee haue not now,</hi>
               </hi>
ſaid this holy Father, <hi>hirelings in
ſteed of Sheepe-heards, nor Wolues
in ſteed of hirelings, but in place of
Wolues, wee haue verie Deuils.</hi> This
ſpake Saint <hi>Barnard</hi> of the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and Paſtors in his time. But O
miſerable is that Church, wherein are
hirelings in ſtéed of good Shéepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards,
more miſerable, where are
Wolues in place of hirelings, and moſt
miſerable, where Deuils in roome of
Wolues. For then all goeth to ruine
and decay, then muſt néeds all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in Gods Church bee ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen.</p>
            <p>And ſo was it then, ſo was it in his

               <pb facs="tcp:3344:79"/>
So <hi>Platina</hi> alſo an auncient writer;

Biſhop, and head of Gods

<hi>The Church wherein Gods word is
not preached, muſt needes run againſt

               </hi> And
therefore alſo hee ſaith further, <hi>Nos

<hi>Wee are they, vpon whom all the

               </hi> So <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome:
If you</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>perceiue it

<pb facs="tcp:3344:80"/>
it is towards night, if you ſee it begin to

            <p>
               <hi>Barnard</hi> that holy father in another
place ſpeaking of the Prieſts of his

no perſecution, no Martyrs done vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

death: Nay not ſo,</hi> ſaith he, it is not
ſo, <hi>for now euen they that ſit higheſt in
the Church of God,</hi> they that beare the

and deſtroy Gods ſeruants.</hi> And
again, ſpeaking of the Prieſts and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,
<hi>They would ſeeme to be Gods
friends, yet they are his enemyes they
would be Chriſts kinſmen, yet they are
his aduerſaries, they would be ſeruants to
Chriſt, and yet they ſerue Antechriſt.</hi>
And thus, (Good Bretheren) it hath bin
in our time, and you your ſelues haue
ſéene it, you your ſelues haue ſéene that
the whole Church hath hanged on one
man alone: that ſuch as ſhould haue bin
Paſtors, haue bin deceiuers: ſuch as
ſhould haue bin teachers of the right
way, haue bin ſeducers and guydes into
blind wayes: ſuch as ſhould haue bin
Prelats, haue bin Pilates. You your
ſelues haue ſéene in the Church of God
hyrelings in ſtéed of good Shepheards,
wolfes in place of hyrelings, and verie
deuils in the roome of wolfes. All theſe
things haue bin ſpoken of afore, That
the Maieſtie in the Emperor, and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb facs="tcp:3344:81"/>
in the Biſhop ſhould decay: that
where Gods word is not preached, there
muſt the Church néeds run againſt the
rocke: that it is little marueile if faith
faileth, where good inſtruction wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth:
that pityfull deſolation is come
into the houſe of God: that wée are they
vpon whom the dregs of the whole
Earth are come: that it is then high
night, when ignorance raigneth in the
Biſhops: and laſtly, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
now left, but that Antechriſt be
reuealed. All theſe things haue béen ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of before, and are now come to paſſe,
and you your ſelues haue ſéen them, you
your ſelues, I ſay, haue ſéene all theſe
things fulfilled. You haue ſéene ſuch ſit
higheſt in Gods Church, that haue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted
God &amp; his Church: ſuch as haue
martyrd the ſeruants of Chriſt, ſuch as
would ſéeme Gods friends, and yet are
his enemies: ſuch as would be Chriſts
kynſmen, and yet are his aduerſaries:
ſuch as would be ſeruants to Chriſt,
and yet doe ſerue Antechriſt: ſuch as
<hi>Eſaie</hi> ſpeaketh of, ſaying, <hi>They haue
broken downe my vine, and deſtroyed
<pb facs="tcp:3344:81"/>
my wine preſſe:</hi> ſuch as Chriſt himſelfe
ſpeaketh of, and ſaith,<note place="margin">Math. 21.</note> 
               <hi>They haue made
my Church a den of theeues.</hi> Therefore
(good Bretheren) let not vs deceiue our
ſelues, let vs not ſay all things were wel
in the Church, there needed no refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
all things were as they ſhould
be, there néeded nothing to be amended.
For, alas, all things were out of order,
all things out of ſquare, all things ſo
confounded, that all things néeded to be
amended. I ſpeake herein only gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,
I ſpeake not here of the particular
things amiſſe in Gods Church, for then
ſhould time faile mée, if I ſhould recount
them vnto you particularly. In time
paſt, if any one man would haue ſought
comfort for his afflicted conſcience, where
ſhould he haue ſought it? whether ſhould
he haue gon for comfort? where ſhould he
haue craued conſolation? what comfort
could we haue of our owne merits,
what help by our owne deſerts, and good
déeds? what conſolation of the Popes
Bulls and Pardons? Alas, no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
no conſolation, no helpe at all.
And yet vnto thoſe were wée taught
<pb facs="tcp:3344:82"/>
to run, in thoſe were we taught to ſéeke
comfort, and at them to craue conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
In the Church, before time, it
hath béen both ſaid &amp; ſung vnto the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<hi>Tu per Thomae ſauguinem, fac nos aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendere
vbi Thomas nunc eſt, <hi>Thou Chriſt,
by the blood of thy Martyr S. Thomas,
make vs worthie to aſcend thither, where
Thomas now is.</hi>
               </hi> This, I ſay, as a praier
hath béen vſed and ſung in the Church of
God. The Mother alſo, that bleſſed
Mother of our Sauior Chriſt, hath bin
openly blaſphemed in the Church: ſhée
was called, <hi>Spes, vita, dulcedo, <hi>Our hope,
our life, and our ſweetneſſe;</hi>
               </hi> and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>Salua omnes ſperantes in te, <hi>Saue all
them that truſt in thee.</hi>
               </hi> Thus haue men
openly prayed vnto her, to the great
blaſpheming of her holie name. But O
Chriſt, O thou that ſuffredſt for the
whole world, where was then thy Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
where was then that precious
blood of thine that waſhed awaie the
ſinnes of Man, where was then the
Lambe of God that redéemed all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind?
Loath I am to ſpeake of theſe
things, loath and ſorie I am to repeat
<pb facs="tcp:3344:82"/>
them here vnto you, but I am inforced
ſo to do, ſomewhat the more plainly to
open vnto you the great abuſes, the
wonderfull Errors that long time haue
raigned in the Church of God. We had
Prayers, but, alas, as they were vſed,
they were no prayers: we had the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
but we knew not to what end
thoſe Sacraments were left vnto vs.
We had Baptiſme, but we knew not
what Baptiſme ment. The Teſtament,
and holie Goſpell of God, was burnt,
caſt downe, and trod vnder foot. And
in one word, in one word for all, there
was in Chriſts Church nothing but a
heap of wickedneſſe, nothing but a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
heap of confuſion and wickedneſſe.
<hi>Ieremie</hi> the prophet ſaid, <hi>That all men,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ier. 31.</note>
(after Chriſt once appeared) <hi>ſhould
haue ſuch knowledge, ſuch perfit know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God, that no man ſhould ſay to
his neighbor, know the Lord, for all men
ſhould know him, euen from the higheſt
vnto the loweſt. Baruch</hi> alſo the prophet,<note place="margin">Baruch. 4:</note>
ſaid, <hi>O bleſſed art thou Iſrael, how hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie
art thou, ſeeing God hath ſhewed
vnto thee all ſuch things as are pleaſant
<pb facs="tcp:3344:83"/>
vnto him;</hi> what euer God would haue
knowen, that is reuealed vnto thée. O
then, what may we ſay of our ſelues,
and the blind time that is now paſt,
wherein we neither knew God, nor had
Gods word reuealed vnto vs? what
may we ſay of that time? O we may
well ſay, miſerable were wée, and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
was that time wherein wée then
lyued.</p>
            <p>And thus (Good Bretheren) I haue
in few words laid open before you, both
the miſerable eſtate that Gods Church
hath ſtood in, and the great ignorance,
error, and blindneſſe that you haue béen
led in: to the end, that you may now
become the more thankfull for Gods
great mercie ſhewed vnto you. For now
hath it pleaſed Almightie God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale
vnto you his holie Goſpell, his
trueth, and veritie. Now we know
that what euer we doe, when we haue
done all things that we can doe, yet, <hi>we
are vnprofitable ſeruants.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 17.</note> Now wée
know that all our comfort, all our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation,
all our helps, is to be ſought for
at Gods hands alone: Now we know,
<pb facs="tcp:3344:83"/>
that Chriſt is only our Sauior, our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>déemer,
and that <hi>his blood alone,</hi> as S.
<hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, <hi>hath waſhed away our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 1.</note>
Now we know what we pray:
Now we know wherefore, and to what
end the Sacraments were left vnto vs;
what our Baptiſme meaneth: Now
haue we Gods Teſtament and his helie
word reſtored vnto vs: Now we néed
not to ſay to our neyghbor, know the
Lord; for we all are, or may be, ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
inſtructed to know God, to know
Chriſt, to know the holie Ghoſt. Now
may we ſay, as <hi>Baruch</hi> to the Children
of Iſrael, <hi>O happie are we, for all things
that God would haue knowen are reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
vnto vs.</hi> And therefore bleſſed are our
eyes, and the eyes which ſée that we ſée;
And on the other part accurſed are thoſe
eyes which will not ſée that we ſée, accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
are the eares which will not heare
that we heare, &amp; accurſed are thoſe harts
that will not beléeue God, &amp; his Goſpell.
My Bretheren, conſider the miſerable
eſtate that the Church of God long time
hath ſtood in, and conſider againe, the
ſpéedie redreſſe thereof, which God now
<pb facs="tcp:3344:84"/>
hath ſent vnto vs. The kingdome of
God is come vpon vs, Gods kingdome
(my Bretheren) is euen now come vpon
vs. Chriſt ſaid, <hi>O Ieruſalem, Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,
thou that ſtoneſt my Prophets, and
ſuch as are ſent vnto thee, O that thou
wouldeſt know the time of thy viſitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
We are that Ieruſalem, Chriſt
hath called, Chriſt hath cryed vnto vs:
O therefore let vs now ſée and conſider
the time of our viſitation. O how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
of our Bretheren which haue ſuffred
perſecution for Chriſt and his Gaſpell,
how manie of them, I ſay, would faine
haue ſéene the things that we ſée, and
heare that which we heare, and could
not ſée it. O let vs not deſpiſe our Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
blood, let vs not deſpiſe the calling of christ, let vs not despise the bleſſing
of God, the greateſt that may be. Alas,
if we conſider the miſerable eſtate that
we haue ſtood in, and the great goodneſſe
and mercie of God now ſhewed vnto vs,
doubtleſſe we cannot deſpiſe this great
mercie of his, vnleſſe we will be too vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull,
we cannot neglect this mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueilous
worke, and goodneſſe of his,
<pb facs="tcp:3344:84"/>
vnleſſe we will be counted too much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratfull.</p>
            <p>Let vs therefore make our ſelues new
harts, new ſoules, new minds, let vs
ioyfully imbrace God and his Goſpell,
let our eyes, our eares, and our harts
ſay, Bleſſed are the eyes which ſée that
we ſée, and eares which heare that we
heare: for manie Kings and Prophets
haue deſired to ſée that we ſée, and
could not ſée it. And thus if we doe, then
ſhall we be bleſſed, then ſhall our eyes,
our eares, our harts, be bleſſed; and
God the father of light, and giuer of all
goodneſſe, ſhall bleſſe vs, and remaine
with vs for euer. Amen.</p>

to preach the glad ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
of the Goſpell, and
teſtifie the name of Chriſt
vnto the whole world, as he was much
troubled with falſe Prophets, falſe Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
and ſuch as ſeduced the people
from God; euen ſo he found a number
of them among the Corinthians, to
whom he wrot this Epiſtle, or Letter.
Some of them, to diſcredite <hi>Paul,</hi> and
bring an euill opinion of him among the
<pb facs="tcp:3344:85"/>
people, ſaid he was an enemie vnto
<hi>Moyſes,</hi> one that ſought to aboliſh the
Law giuen by <hi>Moyſes,</hi> and ſuch a one
as deſpiſed and brake the ſame. Some
other ſaid that he was a teacher of falſe
doctrine, a ſeducer of the people, one that
diſſented cleane from the reſt of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
yea, and ſuch a one as diſquieted
the whole Church of Chriſt. All theſe
things were reported by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> thus
was he ſlaundered, thus was he euill
ſpoken of: and this was done euen by
ſuch as profeſſed the name of Chriſt.
Therefore he féeling himſelfe herewith
touched, and perceiuing alſo that this
not only touched him, but God him
ſelfe, thought good by his Letters to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyd
this ſlaunder ſo riſen, and to cléere
himſelfe vnto the Corinthians, among
whom this euil brute firſt ſprang of him.
And therefore in the Chapter before, he
ſaid, <hi>Chriſt hath committed vnto vs the
preaching of the attonement,</hi> &amp; ſo what
euer we doe, what euer we teach, or
preach vnto you, is only to this end,
to ſhew our ſelues inſtruments of the

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:3344:86"/>
Now then are wee meſſengers in the
roome of Chriſt, and therefore, euen as
though God did beſeech you thorough
vs, ſo pray we you, that ye be at one
with God; and further we exhort you,
that ye receiue not the grace of God in
vaine.</p>
            <p>Almightie God perceiuing the frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and weakneſſe of this nature of ours,
euen at the firſt beginning of the world
pronounced thus,<note place="margin">Gen. 6.</note> and ſaid, <hi>Pronum eſt

               </hi> This God

and therefore he ſpake thus of it. So
dull are wée of our ſelues, to learne any
good, and ſo quicke are we to forget the

and ſo hard are we to incline vnto ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.
And this hath béene ingraffed in
vs, this hath béen grounded in this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

We muſt doe that which longeth vnto

And this haue wée in our commiſſion,

               </hi>
I would that I might be caſt away, ſo

            <p>O my brethren, conſider theſe harts,
conſider, I ſay, the zealous hart that
<hi>Moſes,</hi> the zealous affection that <hi>Paule</hi>
had vnto the ſaluation of the people.
What thinke you is it to be ſtriken out
of the booke of life? What thinke you
is it to be a man accurſed, and haue por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
among reprobates? <hi>Moſes</hi> was
content to be blotted out of the booke of
life, ſo that the people of Iſraell might
be ſaued. S. <hi>Paule</hi> was content to bée
accurſed and caſt from the face of God,
ſo that Gods people might not be caſt to
perdition. Thus they of an earneſt heart
and zealous loue they bare to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
of God, wiſhed their owne
deſtruction for the ſafegard of others.
Therefore alſo it behooueth you, my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
you that are temporall men, it
behooueth you on the other part not to
deſpiſe Gods meſſengers, not to ſet light
by them that preach you the Goſpel and
<pb facs="tcp:3344:89" rendition="simple:additions"/>
glad tydings of your ſaluation. For this
is the onely meanes whereby it pleaſeth
God that we ſhould be ſaued, this onely
is it whereby the people is won vnto
Chriſt. God might haue ſent an Angel
vnto the chamberlaine of the Quéene
<hi>Candace,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 8.</note> and ſo haue conuerted him:
but he ſent <hi>Philip,</hi> he ſent <hi>Philip,</hi> I
ſay, a poore and meane man, that tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
his preaching he might bee won
to the faith and ſo brought to ſaluation.
God might haue ſent an Angell to <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 10.</note>
but he ſent <hi>Peter,</hi> who inſtructed

it were if any one man would miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe
the grace of his Prince, a great

it is, yea a farre greater matter, to
take the grace of God in vaine. For

               <hi>Bleſſed are they</hi>
(ſaith Chriſt) <hi>which heare the word of
God, and keepe it.</hi> The Scribes, the
Phariſies, the Iewes, <hi>Annas, Caiphas,</hi>
and <hi>Pilate</hi> heard the word of God, heard
Chriſt himſelfe ſpeak &amp; preach amongſt
them, and yet they receiued this word
of God in vain, they receiued this grace
of God in vain. Chriſt likened his word
to <hi>a ſower that went forth and ſowed his
ſeed, whereof ſome fell by the way ſide,
and ſo wast troden with mens feet and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed,
ſome on the ſtone, which tooke

it lacked moiſtneſſe, ſome fell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong

huſbandman loſt in maner his whole
coſt and labour, for of all that he ſowed,
little fell into the good ground &amp; brought
any increaſe. And euen thus ſtandeth
it with Gods Goſpell now a daies: for

ſo much, few, yea verie few are found
<pb facs="tcp:3344:90" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that receiue the ſame, &amp; continue therin,
and ſo bring forth fruits of ſaluation.
When <hi>Moſes</hi> the ſeruant of God, was
but a little time departed from the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,<note place="margin">Exod. 32.</note>
and gone vp into the mount there
to talke with God, and aſke councell of
him, the people by and by made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
a golden Calfe, and fell to the
worſhipping of that Image. And this
did they becauſe they receiued the grace
of God in vaine. When <hi>Moſes</hi> was
dead, and <hi>Ioſua</hi> ſuccéeded into his roome,
ſtraight-waies the people worſhipped

And this did he becauſe he receiued

S. <hi>Paule</hi> in this place willed the
Corinthians that they ſhould not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
the grace of God in vaine, as the
people did in <hi>Moſes</hi> time: that they
ſhould not receiue it as they did which
liued in the time of <hi>Ioſuah:</hi> that they

did: and laſtly that they ſhould not ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
it in vaine as <hi>Iudas</hi> did, and worke
their owne deſtruction. This was his
requeſt, this thing he onely deſired, that
they wold not receiue the grace of God
in vaine.</p>
            <p>For God ſaith, <hi>In an acceptable time
haue I heard thee, and in the day of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
haue I ſuccoured thee.</hi> Theſe
words are written in the propheſie of
<hi>Eſay,</hi> and pronounced they were by him
of the apparance of Chriſt our Sauiour,
and his comming into this world. And
theſe words thus ſpoken by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
S. <hi>Paule</hi> here fitly applyed to the
<pb facs="tcp:3344:91" rendition="simple:additions"/>
preaching of Chriſts goſpell. For like as
our Sauiour came into the world at
ſuch time as Chriſt was borne; ſo when
the Goſpell is truely preached, and
Gods holy word ſincerely taught vs,
then is Chriſt opened vnto vs, then is
the acceptable time, and our ſaluation,
is wrought thereby. Therefore S. <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erom</hi>
that holy father and old Doctour
of the Church, ſaith; <hi>Quotiescunque au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimus
Euangelium Chriſti, toties caro &amp;
ſanguis Chriſti funduntur in aures noſtras.
<hi>As often as we hear the Goſpel of Chriſt
preached vnto vs, ſo oft the fleſh and
bloud of Chriſt is powred into our eares,</hi>
               </hi>
ſaith S. <hi>Hierom.</hi> And theſe words of
his do plainly and moſt euidently ſhew
vs, how we ſhould vnderſtand the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of Chriſts body, &amp; drinking of his
moſt holy bloud in the Sacrament;
theſe words, I ſay, may ſufficiently
teach vs what is meant by the eating &amp;
drinking of Chriſts body &amp; bloud. This
is it that S. <hi>Paule</hi> here ſpeaketh of, that
they receiue not the grace of God in
vain. And whenſoeuer the goſpel of God
is truly &amp; ſincerely preached, and it recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<pb facs="tcp:3344:92"/>
accordingly, then is the acceptable
time, then is the time of grace and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.
O what a comfortable ſaying is
this; whenſoeuer we heare the Goſpell
taught vs, whenſoeuer we heare Gods
holy word preached vnto vs, then is the
gate of ſaluation ſet open vnto vs, and
then is the time of grace. And on the
contrarie part, when Gods word is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from vs, and the light of his Goſpel
hidden from our eyes, then is the gate
of ſaluation ſhut vpon vs, and then is
the time of perdition. But alas, the time
of grace, the acceptable time, the time of
mercie and ſaluation hath oftentimes
but little continuance among vs, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
it hath ſmall time of abiding with
vs. For before Chriſt appeared, and
was borne into this world, for the ſpace
of foure hundred yeares, the whole
world, the Iewes onely excepted, was
in ignorance and altogether blindneſſe.
And when Chriſt was borne, when hee
once appeared, then was the acceptable
time, then was the time of grace, then
was the time of ſaluation. Here ſome
man will peraduenture ſay; Why did
<pb facs="tcp:3344:92"/>
God ſuffer the whole world ſo long to
be in blindneſſe? why would he in that
long time haue no reſpect to any other
nation, but onely to the nation of the
Iewes? This caſe is déepe, and paſſeth
our capacitie to reaſon, it is aboue the
reach of mans wit, and therefore
herein wee haue onely to ſubmit our
ſelues, to humble our hearts and our
minds, and ſay with <hi>Paul</hi> the Apoſtle,
<hi>O homo quis tu qui Deum arguis? <hi>O man,
what art thou that findeſt fault with
God?</hi>
               </hi> What art thou that reprooueſt
the almightie? As God of his proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence

the ſpring, and likewiſe the fall of the
leafe againe: So hath hee ordained a

a time of ſaluation, and a time of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.

               </gap>ueth into the

is ſo blind, who ſo farre paſt knowledge,
but may both well ſée and remember the

and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt,
This Epiſtle, or letter of
Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> written vnto
the Romans, is diuided into two ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
parts.</p>
            <p>In the firſt part, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth
and telleth them of the beginning
of their religion, of the foundation of
their faith, of the grace whereunto they
<pb facs="tcp:3344:99"/>
are called by the merits and death of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt. And, for becauſe he ſaw and
well perceiued, that euen ſuch of the
Romans, who had receiued the faith,
to bée farce from the works of the faith,
and the profeſſion of the goſpel of Chriſt,
therefore he inſtructeth them that they
know the teſtament of Chriſt, that they
know the couenant of their ſaluation:
and that they ſhould remember, that
where before time they were ſtrangers
from God, cleane without any promiſe
of grace, enemies vnto God, and the
children of perdition, were now called
vnto God, were become the ſons of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi>
Gods deere friends, and the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of adoption: and this not of any
deſert of theirs, not by any merit of
their owne, but onely through the great
grace, and méere mercy of Ieſus Chriſt.
For the whole world was couered vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
wickedneſſe, the whole world, I
ſay, the Iewes onely excepted, was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerwhelmed
in ſinne, and had no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
at all of any ſaluation by God.
But yet when Chriſt Ieſus the Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
of all the world appeared, and the
<pb facs="tcp:3344:100"/>
Iewes would not acknowledge him
their redéemer, it pleaſed God by him to
ſaue the whole world, and call vnto his
grace aſwel the Gentile as the Iew, the
vncircumciſed as the circumciſed: and
this did he onely of his infinit and great
goodneſſe. And therefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in
the concluſion hereof, crieth out, and
ſaith,<note place="margin">Rom. 11. 33</note> 
               <hi>O the deepneſſe of the aboundant
wiſedome and knowledge of God, how
vnſearchable are his iudgements, and
his wayes paſt finding out! Who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the mind of the Lord? who was his
Counſellor? Who hath giuen vnto him
firſt, that hee might bee recompenſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine?</hi>
And therefore hée concludeth
thus:<note place="margin">Rom. 11. 36</note> 
               <hi>Quia in illo, ex illo, &amp; per illum
omnia, illi omnis honor &amp; gloria: <hi>For of
him, through him, and for him are all
things: to him therefore bee glorie for
euer.</hi>
               </hi> Thus doth Saint <hi>Paule</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
the firſt part, to know the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant
of their ſaluation, to know the
greatneſſe of Gods mercie, whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
they are called, and to giue the
prayſe and thankes therefore to him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:3344:100"/>
In the ſecond part, which I now
handle, hee inſtructeth them of a vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
life, of honeſt conuerſation, and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
liuing among all men. For it is
not enough to change our Religion, it
is not ſufficient to alter our faith, but
we muſt alſo change our old life, wee
muſt walke in newneſſe of life, we muſt
walke in holineſſe, wee muſt walke as
becommeth the profeſſors of a new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
as becommeth them that are of
a right faith, as becometh all ſuch as
confeſſe God and his Goſpel. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
S. <hi>Paul</hi> writing vnto the Hebrews
ſaith;<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 19.</note> 
               <hi>Seeing that we by the means of the
bloud of Ieſus haue libertie to enter into
the holy place, let vs draw nigh with a
true heart in a ſure faith, let vs prouoke
vnto loue and to good workes.</hi> So in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
place he ſaith; <hi>You were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
darkneſſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ephe. 5. 8.</note> 
               <hi>but now ye are light in
the Lord, walke therfore as becommeth
the children of light:</hi> So God himſelfe
when he had choſen the Iewes to be his
people, and them alone amongſt all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Nations to worſhip him, ſaid;<note place="margin">Deut. 10.</note> 
               <hi>O
Iſrael, what is it that I require or ſeek for
<pb facs="tcp:3344:101"/>
at thy hands, but that thou loue mee, and
keepe my commandements:</hi> This is the
onely thing that I would haue you to
doe, that you kéepe my Law and walke
in my Precepts.</p>
            <p>Therefore Saint <hi>Paule</hi> himſelfe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,
after hee had declared and ſet
forth at large, the great goodneſſe and
mercie of God, he ſaid, <hi>I beſeech you,
that yee make your bodies a quicke and
liuely Sacrifice, holy and acceptable vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God, which is, your reaſonable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
of God.</hi> Renew your ſpirits,
make your ſelues new harts, that it
may ſhew and appeare in you, that
you are reconciled vnto GOD,
that you are the children of adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and profeſſours of Gods holy
name.</p>
            <p>Therfore <hi>bee not high minded, bee
not wiſe in your owne opinions: recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
no man euill for euill: prouide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand
things honeſt in the ſight of all
men: and if it bee poſſible, haue peace
with all men.</hi> Marke well my brethren
theſe words by the way, <hi>If it be poſſible
haue peace with all men.</hi> Chriſt, though
<pb facs="tcp:3344:101"/>
hee was the author ſo peace, and the
true peace it ſelfe, yet could he not haue
peace with all men. <hi>Non veni pacem mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <note place="margin">Luk. 12.</note> ſed diſcordiam,
<hi>I am not come</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>to ſend
peace into the world, but war and diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
for from hence forth there ſhall be
fiue in one houſe diuided, three againſt
two, and two againſt three. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
againſt the Son, and the Son a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Father. The mother againſt
the daughter, and the daughter againſt
the mother.</hi> The peace of the world
is no peace with God: the loue of this
world is no loue before God.</p>
            <p>So the Patriarches and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
though they were men of peace,
yet could they haue no peace in this
world. And therefore Saint <hi>Paule</hi>
here ſaith, <hi>If it bee poſſible, as much
as in you ſhall lye, haue peace with all
all men,</hi> bee in vnitie and loue with all
manner of men. This thing, my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
I haue put you in remembrance
of by the way.</p>
            <p>But that S. <hi>Paule</hi> ſhould thus doe,
that he ſhould exhort the Romanes,
<pb facs="tcp:3344:102"/>
as he here doth, that they become <hi>not
high minded, nor wiſe in their owne opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
nor recompence no man euill for
euill, and that they ſhould, if it were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
haue peace with all men,</hi> good cauſe
there was, there was, I ſay, good cauſe,
why he ſhould thus doe. For there were
at the ſame time in Rome, a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
both of Iewes and Gentiles, and
amongſt them there was great ſtrife
and diuiſion. The Iewes on the one
ſide eſtéemed not the Gentils: the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other ſide deſpiſed the Iewes.
Thus betwéene them the people were
diuided, and rent into diſſention: thus
betwéene them the whole people often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
were readie to fal together by the
eares: and thus thorough them, were
they at ſuch great contention and ſtrife
that they that were brethren would not
vouchſafe to commune, &amp; talke together:
they that before were linked in ſuch loue
and vnited together, that one would die
for the other, could not then one abide
another: and ſuch as were friends, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
open enemies. And this came to
paſſe onely through pride. Pride was
<pb facs="tcp:3344:102"/>
the cauſe that ſuch as were brethren fell
out one with another: pride was the
cauſe that ſuch as ſhould haue died one
for another, could not one abide another:
pride was the cauſe that ſuch as before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
were friends, became then open e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies.
The Iewes on the one part
were proud, for that they were the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of <hi>Abraham,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 9.</note> for that they were
vnder the Law and promiſe, for that
they had knowledge of Gods wil by O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
for that God had oftentimes
both ſent his Angels vnto them, and
ſpoken by his owne mouth vnto them;
and the Gentiles had none of all theſe:
they were not of the ſéed of <hi>Abraham:</hi>
they were not vnder the promiſe: they
neuer had knowledge of Gods wil, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by Oracle, nor viſion: God neuer
ſpake vnto them, nor neuer ſent his
Angels vnto them. The Gentiles on
the other ſides, were as proud as the
Iews: they ſaid that they had wiſe men
amongſt them, men of great learning
and knowledge: they had Philoſophers,
they had Aſtronomers, they had Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metritians,
and great Orators; and ſo
<pb facs="tcp:3344:103"/>
had not the Iewes amongſt them:
They had no men of great wiſdome,
they had no men of any high learning,
they had no Philoſophers, no Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomers,
no Geometricians, nor O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators;
they were men ignorant, and
without any great knowledge at all.
Saint <hi>Paule</hi> therefore to ſet an vnitie
betweene theſe two which were thus
farre at diſcorde, exhorteth them that
<hi>They all thinke one thing, that they
bee of like affection one towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
that they bee not high minded,
nor wiſe in their owne opinions.</hi> For
pride it is that breaketh all loue, and
pride it is that breedeth all diſſention.
There was neuer yet diuiſion, there
was neuer any diſcord or diſſention, but
Pride was the firſt cauſe and authour
thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lucifer,</hi> that ſometime was an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell
of GOD, ſet himſelfe againſt
GOD, and ſaid; <hi>Exaltabo me ſuper
Aquilonem, &amp; ero ſimilis Altiſſimo, I
will get mee vp aboue the North Pole,
I will ſit aboue the clouds, and <hi>I will
bee like vnto the moſt higheſt.</hi>
               </hi> And
<pb facs="tcp:3344:103"/>
this did hee, for that hee ſwelled with
pride. And therefore was he throwen
downe, onely for this great pride of his
was hee caſt into vtter darkneſſe, and
déepe dungeon of hell.</p>

            <p>The Iewes themſelues, which had

            <p>And this did they onely thorough
pride. But alas, ſaith Saint <hi>Paule, Is

preach one and the ſame Chriſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

<pb facs="tcp:3344:104"/>
all meats &amp; drinks were indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
vnto them,<note place="margin">Rom. 14.</note> becauſe they could with
ſafe conſcience indifferently eat of all
meats and drinke of al kinds of drink)
were proud, and thought themſelues
more perfit than other men. On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide, ſuch as had a conſcience therin,
ſuch as could not for conſcience ſake in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently
vſe all kinds of meats and
drinkes, were likewiſe proud, and
thought themſelues more holy than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men.</p>
            <p>And thus pride, euen amongſt ſuch
as profeſſed Chriſt and his Goſpell,
brake the loue and vnitie which ſhould
haue béene amongſt them that liued vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Goſpel. Pride it was that cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the Iewes to hate the Gentiles, and
the Gentiles to deſpiſe the Iewes.
Pride it was that cauſed <hi>Lucifer</hi> ſo
much to exalt himſelfe, and make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe

that cauſed the other which could not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently

               </hi> And vpon this foundation
of humility, it pleaſed almightie God, at
the firſt to erect &amp; build his holie Church,
vpon his Apoſtles, I ſay, who were the
very paterns of méekneſſe, it ſéemed good
vnto God to build his holy Church. And
after them ſuch as were of the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Chriſt, ſuch as profeſſed the name
of Chriſt, were not proud men, were
<pb facs="tcp:3344:106"/>
not men of haut courage, nor high min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.

               <hi>Erat illis cor vnum,

they were méeke in heart, &amp; hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of mind, and therefore were they
méet to poſſeſſe the earth: they learned
at Chriſt to be méeke and lowlie, they
had the ſame ſence in them that was in

the fooliſh things of the earth, therefore
were they méet inſtruments to confou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
the wiſdome of the world: they were
counted the weake things, &amp; therefore
were they méet to ouercome the mightie.
The Babes were méeke &amp; lowlie, and
therefore were they méet to ſpred abroad
the glorie of God. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> of all his
learning thought that he knew nothing,
ſo much he humbled himſelfe: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

There is a ſtorie, or rather a fable, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
of S. <hi>Anthonie;</hi> whether you take
it as a ſtorie, or a fable, I much recke
not, but it ſerueth well for this purpoſe,
it is thus. Saint <hi>Anthonie</hi> on a time lay

downe from Heauen, (as he thought)
&amp; ſaw all the whole earth ſo thicke coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with ſnares, that poſſible it was not
for any man to tread vpon the earth, and
not be intangled therewithall: and this
when he beheld, ſuddeinly he cried out,
and ſaid, O Lord, and who can then
walke on the earth, and not be intrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped?
with that he heard a voice that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered

               </hi> it is, ſaid that voice, that

            <p>Thus, (good Bretheren) humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
preſerueth the Church of God, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie
vphouldeth all good Common
weales. Pride it is that ſcattereth the
Church of God, pride ouerthroweth
all good Common weales. There was
yet neuer pride in any Citie without
diſſention, nor diſſention that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
without deſtruction of the whole
Common weale. Ye ſhall neuer read
in any record, eyther of Citie, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
<pb facs="tcp:3344:107" rendition="simple:additions"/>
or Common weale, but that, if
pride raigned therein, there conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
followed diſſention, and of diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
inſued the ouerthrow of the ſame.
In the Citie of <hi>Rome,</hi> which was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the <hi>Ladie</hi> of the whole world, there
were two that tooke vpon them the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernance
of the <hi>Empire, Iulius Caeſar,</hi>
and <hi>Pompey. Iulius Caeſar</hi> was a man
of ſo haught courage, that he could abide
no péere, <hi>Pompey</hi> was of ſuch an high
mynd, that hée could ſuffer no man to
be his egall. And thus for dominion,
ſtroue theſe two together: and thus
thorough their diſſention, was not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
the whole Citie, but the kingdome
it ſelfe brought to deſtruction. The
ſtate of the Gretians, which then chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
aboue other floriſhed, becauſe it
was diuided, came to vtter confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
But what ſpeake I of theſe? what
ſpeak I of Rome, and the ſtate of the
Gretians. Who is there that hath not
heard of <hi>Ieruſalem, Ieruſalem</hi> I ſay,
that great City, that ſame Towne that
God had choſen to him ſelfe, euen
that ſame Towne wherein God would
<pb facs="tcp:3344:108"/>
haue his Temple erected, and his holie
name honored, after that the Rulers
thereof began to be diuided, after that
the Magiſtrats fell to diſcord, and each
man would be a Captaine, and no man
would be ruled: then came the enemies
in, then was it beſieged, then was the
Mother for verie famine conſtreined to
eat her owne childe, then was it vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deſtroyed, and no one ſtone left vpon
an other; and which was moſt miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
there were ſlaine in that Citie
xj. hundred thouſand people, and the
verie chanels in the ſtréets ran all with
blood. Thus miſerably was it ouerthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen,
and in ſuch wretched eſtate were
the whole people thereof: and this only
came to paſſe, thorough pride and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſention.
And this was it that <hi>Eſaie</hi> long
time before propheſied of, and ſaid,
<hi>Then ſhall the whole Countrey be ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eſa. 3. 14.</note>
               <hi>when the people once conſpire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
their Princes.</hi> And therefore alſo
an old writter, <hi>Petrus Lilius</hi> ſaith, <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
is the only cauſe of the ouerthrow
of Kingdomes; Diuiſion is the onlie
cauſe that great Empires can not ſtand;
<pb facs="tcp:3344:108"/>
Diſſention maketh two kingdomes of
one; Diſſention maketh of two Cities
one, and at length it maketh of two king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
no kingdome, of two Cities, no
Citie.</hi> This writeth <hi>Petrus Lilius,</hi> of
Diſſention, this is the end of Diſcord
ſayth he, and in déed experience hath
taught that this is moſt true.</p>
            <p>But wherefore ſpeake I of theſe
things? wherefore do I here repeat vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you theſe old and auncient hiſtories?
why recount I vnto you the ouerthrow
of <hi>Rome?</hi> the deſtruction of the <hi>Greti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans?</hi>
the deſolation of <hi>Ieruſalem?</hi> which
all hapned thorough Diuiſion. I would
to God I ſaw nothing euen now before

ſay; I would to God, I ſay, that I ſaw
now nothing preſent before mine eyes,
that cauſeth me thus to ſay. But theſe
examples, (my Bretheren) God hath
placed before our eyes, that we might
take heed by them, that we might the
better looke to our ſelues, and beware of
our owne deſtruction. Chriſt hath ſaid,

<hi>Rome,</hi> that ſometime was the weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyeſt

againſt the Deuill and his adherents:
our part is to diſſuade you from diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to diſſuade you from diſcord and

his duetie. Therefore hath God
ſet him vp, therefore hath God exalted
him aboue the reſt of the people, that he
ſhould guid them in peace, &amp; lead them in
loue and vnitie together. Thus did <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi>
that good king; he found the whole
kingdome left by <hi>Saul</hi> his predeceſſor
in diſſention and diuiſion within it ſelfe,
he found, I ſay, the whole countrey at
variance and great debate: but by his
great wiſdome and good gouernance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
hée reduced the ſame into good
order againe, and ſuch as before were
<pb facs="tcp:3344:110"/>
enemyes, he made faithfull friends,
and the whole Countrey he brought to
quietneſſe, peace, and mutuall vnitie.
And therfore, when he had this brought
to paſſe, for ioy that he had thus of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
foes, made louing friends, he ſung,
<hi>O quàm bonum,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 133.</note>

               </hi> So much it comforted
him, ſo glad was he when he ſaw his
people agrée together. Therefore in the
Scriptures the Magiſtrates are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Shepheards,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 78.</note> for that they ought ſo

ſuch reſpect to Gods people, as the good

Therefore likewiſe are they called

But chiefly it is required in them,
it is chiefly, and aboue all other things
required in ſuch as are Magiſtrates,
that they them ſelues know God, that

<hi>Iuſtinian</hi> had, the ſame, and the like
ought euery good Magiſtrate to haue:
<pb facs="tcp:3344:112"/>
as <hi>Dauid, Ezechias,</hi> and <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> did,
ſo ſhould euery good and godlie officer
doe: hée muſt not giue himſelfe vnto
ſléep, nor his eye lids vnto reſt, before
he hath prouided a Temple for the God
of <hi>Iacob:</hi> he muſt not go home vnto his
owne houſe, before that he hath purged
Gods Church: he muſt haue as great
reſpect to the ſaluation of Gods flocke,
as he hath regard to the ſafegard of his
owne Soule: he muſt remember that
his chaire is Gods chaire, that his
ſword is Gods ſword. Now (good Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theren)
it behooueth you of your part, to
put away all hatred, to aboliſh from him
all pride, diſſention, all diſcord, and to
honor the Magiſtrate, to follow you
your Shepheard, as the ſhéepe do their
ſhepheard: to ioy in him your Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
as the Souldiers reioyce in their
Captaine: to be gouerned by him your
head, as the members of the bodie are
ruled by the head: and laſtly, ſo to be
in ſubiection vnto him, as the childe is
in obedience and ſubiection to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
And ſo ſhall there then be, both a
godlie Magiſtrat, ſo ſhall there be god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
<pb facs="tcp:3344:112"/>
people, and ſo ſhall there be a godlie
Realme.</p>
            <p>Now let vs here thinke that Saint
<hi>Paule</hi> ſpeaketh theſe words vnto vs
(as indéed he ſpeaketh them vnto vs, if
we are, or will be called Chriſtians) vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
vs, he ſaith; <hi>Bee not high minded,</hi>
vnto vs he ſaith; <hi>Bee not wiſe in your
owne opinions:</hi> vnto vs he ſaith; <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
no man euill for euill:</hi> vnto
vs he ſaith, <hi>If it bee poſſible haue peace
with all men.</hi> O then, why are wee of
ſuch proud hearts? Why are wee high
minded? Why are we wiſe in our own
opinions? Why recompence wee euill
for euill? Why ſéeke we reuengement?
why agrée not we together? O by whoſe
name ſhall I cal you? I would I might
call you brethren: but alas, this heart of
yours is not brotherly. I would I might
call you Chriſtians: but alas, you are
no Chriſtians. I know not by what
name I ſhall call you: for if you were
Brethren, you wold loue as Brethren:
if you were Chriſtians, you would agrée
as Chriſtians. Chriſt ſaid vnto his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
and ſo by them to all ſuch as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
<pb facs="tcp:3344:113"/>
his name;<note place="margin">Ioh. 13.</note> 
               <hi>Mandatum nouum do vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis,
vt diligatis mutuo, ſicut &amp; ego dilexi
vos, <hi>I giue you a new commandement,</hi>
               </hi>
ſaid Chriſt, <hi>that you loue together euen
as I haue loued you.</hi> By this token, by
this cognuſance of mine ſhal men know
you to be my Diſciples, if you loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
as I haue loued you. Let vs looke
well vpon our ſelues, let vs behold our
ſelues well: alas, this badge, this cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſance
is gone, this peace that Chriſt
left vnto vs, is not to be found amongſt
vs.</p>
            <p>O yée that ſometime were brethren,
but now mortall enemies, ye that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
ware this Badge, this cogniſance
of Chriſts peace, which now yée haue
caſt from you, O how long will you fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
vanitie, how long will yée dwell in
diſſention? I haue done my part, I haue
called you to peace, I haue called you to
loue, I haue called you to vnitie: doe
you now your parts, do you enſue after
peace, loue you each other, continue yée
in vnitie together. I haue not the
keyes of your hearts, I am not able to
looſe and open thoſe ſtonie hearts of
<pb facs="tcp:3344:113"/>
yours: God make you al one, God mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie
you hearts, God make you friends,
God graunt you to loue as brethren to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
            <p>Let vs lay aſide this pride of our
heart, let vs not bee wiſe in our owne
opinions, let vs not requite euill with
euill, let vs, as much as may bee, haue
peace with all men. Alas, it is no
great thing that I require of you: I
require onely your loue, I require your
friendſhip one towards another, I aſke
no more but that your hearts bee ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in mutuall loue and vnitie toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Alas, it is a thing that ſoone may
bee granted of ſuch as pray together
of ſuch as haue one heauenly Father,
of ſuch as are partakers of Chriſts ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Sacraments, of ſuch as profeſſe
Chriſt, and will bee called Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</p>
            <p>O how can we pray our Heauenly
father to forgiue vs, if we will not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue
our brother wherein hee treſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
againſt vs. How can wee with
cleere conſcience come vnto the holy
<pb facs="tcp:3344:114"/>
Communion, and bee partakers of
Chriſts moſt holy bodie and bloud, if
wee are not in charitie with our owne
neighbour? Let vs therefore lay aſide
all diſcord without hipocriſie, let vs
lay apart all malice without diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
let vs all ioyne together in bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
loue, let vs all be of like affection
one towards another, let vs not bee
high minded, but let vs make our
ſelues equall to them of the lower ſort.
So ſhall wee make our bodies a quick
and liuely Sacrifice, ſo ſhall wee make
them holy and acceptable vnto God, ſo
ſhall we bee reconciled vnto God, and
God reconciled vnto vs: and finally, ſo
ſhall we which are called Chriſtians, be
knowne to be Gods ſeruants and ſuch
as profeſſe the name of Chriſt, if wee
ſhal be found to haue this peace and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
loue, which is the badge and cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſance
of Chriſt. And ſo ſhall
God be ours, and remaine
with vs for euer.</p>
