         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S I was on my iourney from
<hi>LONDON</hi> homeward, in
the Moneth of <hi>May</hi> last, I
was ouertaken not farre from
<hi>Darnetoune,</hi> by our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-man,
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Dauid Hume,</hi>
Goodman of <hi>Gods-croft.</hi>
After we had saluted one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
we fell incontinent to a conference of Church-gouernment:
hee excused himselfe, that his leasure
serued him not at that time to stay in our companie,
his vrgent affaires forcing him to post before, but hee
promised to send mee his doubts in writing, and I
promised him (if it pleased the Lord) an answere. The
point I tooke in hand to proue, was, that no substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
point of Discipline was changed in our Church.
For, Ecclesiasticke Synods vsed before, are retained
still, the censures of Admonition, Suspension, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication;
yea, the Admission and Deposition of
<pb facs="tcp:9463:3"/>
Pastors, or what euer else pertaynes to the matter of
Discipline; these are not remoued but rectified and
roborated: in that the power to moderate and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
these censures, is not left free to euery one, but
restored againe to the Bishop, to be vsed with aduise
of his Brethren: thus keepe wee still the same Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
but more orderly vsed.</p>

               </gap> dined at <hi>Darneroune,</hi> and parted in louing
manner, with all brotherly kindnes: we ouertooke him
againe at <hi>Dunbar,</hi> where not finding his former hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie,
I maruelled what it could be, or from whom
it c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>me, that so small a change of the soile; should
make so great a change of the affection; for in the one
hee was most kinde, where with reason he might haue
beene more strange; and in the other most strange,
where of dutie hee both might and should haue beene
more kindly. Since that time I fore-gathered not with
him, and I expected nothing, but kindnesse from him,
and that the question should haue beene quietly and
peaceably disputed by writing among our selues, till
now that he hath begunne the publike warre. He had
sent me some missiue Letters written by him to some
others, crauing resolution of his doubts concerning
Church gouernment. And as I was dispatching an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
to him, I was forced to plead for my Conscience
by <hi>APOLOGIE</hi> against a lying Libeller, which here
<hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Dauid</hi> against all dutie and reason hath publicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
impugned. First, because I stood <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ound by promise
to giue an answere to himselfe, and reason would hee
should haue expected it: yea doubtlesse he had gotten
<pb facs="tcp:9463:3"/>
it long ere now, in more quiet and louing manner, if
he had not interrupted me. Secondly, I had written
nothing against <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Dauid,</hi> I touched him not in my
<hi>Apologie,</hi> and no other way gaue I him any cause to
write against mee. Thirdly, hee being a priuate man,
it cannot be but a great Presumption to condemne by
publike writing a Church-gouernment established by
Law and that without knowledge (if himselfe be true)
for he professeth to seeke instruction concerning it,
yea, without eyther calling or lawfull commission.
Fourthly, before euer he sent this Refutation of this
<hi>Apologie</hi> to me, or had discharged with me, he pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
sundry Copies of it to be seene and read of others,
which in our Prouerbe we call <hi>Treason vnder trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
Fiftly, his whole Admonitorie Treatise is full
of Inuectiues <hi>in personam,</hi> without regard of mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie,
yea, of that feare of God which becommeth a
Christian, bringing nothing, or else very little <hi>ad
propositum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus hath <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Dauid</hi> kept no faire warre with
mee, but hath very farre ouer-seene himselfe, and
wronged mee, which that the indifferent may know,
I haue here published his <hi>Admonition</hi> in his owne
words and mine answeres. I haue omitted no materiall
thing in it; onely words of needlesse repetition where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
hee abounds. If hee had contented himselfe to iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the Libeller, in tramping my Name, my Conscience,
my Ministrie vnder his feete, it had beene a proofe of
my patience great enough. But where without reason
or truth, he will beare downe a common cause, and
<pb facs="tcp:9463:4"/>
increase offences in the hearts of simple people, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
of conscience suffer it vnanswered: specially, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
vnder pretence of impugning mee, hee directly
impugneth it. If my heart in this had reproued mee
of my wayes, I might haue lurked in secret, and past
ouer the Libeller, and him also with silence; but an
honest conscience feareth not the light, but rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyceth
in it. Onely I craue of the modest minded
Christian, that if my speeches in the <hi>Answere</hi> at any
time be sharper then becommeth, it be imputed to
humane infirmitie, whereunto the loue of the cause,
and knowledge of mine owne innocencie hath carryed
mee, not want of loue toward him or others. It is no
pleasure to mee to offend any man: if any such haue
escaped mee, I will not excuse my selfe in that which
the wise, godly, and indifferent Reader shall thinke
may iustly be reprehended.</p>

4 O, forsooth, yee were once otherwayes minded concerning Church-gouernement.
In some things, I confesse, I was, in others not. Paritie in
Church-gouernment I euer thought the Mother of confusion, neither can, I
see that God hath beene the Author of it in any of his workes, yea by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie
of his gifts he declares that hee allowes not equalitie in gouernment,
where here, if any strife be about comparison of gifts, I haue no more to say,
but that hee who in humilitie of minde cannot submit himselfe to obay any
other, was neuer meete to bee a Ruler of others, how great so euer has
gifts be.</p>

            <p>And that Preachers should haue place in Parliament, to giue light out of
the holy Oracle, to the Prince and States of the Kingdome, I euer thought
it both reasonable and necessarie, and did by my publike voice approue it in
that generall assembly holden at <hi>Dundie,</hi> wherein this matter was first mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.
And in these publike Lectures which once in the moneth wee had
in our Presbyteriall exercise, for clearing the Controuersies of this time: I
did in my course openly declare, how in Church-gouernment a happy meane
were to be wished betweene Anarchie and Monarchie, two fearefull euils
in the Church, the one proceeding from paritie, wrought confusion, as
might be seene in the pitifull state of the Churches of Flanders: the other
breeding tyrannie and all sort of oppression: a lamentable proofe whereof
we might see in the Churches of Italy, and other parts vnder the dominion
of that Romish Vsurper: thus is there not so great a cause to charge me with
a change, as is alleaged.</p>
            <p>5 But in that wherein before I misliked Episcopall gouernment, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
least tyrannie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> libertie, and other euils should follow it, if now, percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
a Christian King most carefull out of his rare pietie and wisedome, to
see it vsed vnto the right end, I haue changed my minde, as many others,
both worthie Fathers, and brethren in our Church haue done, to whom the
world cannot denie an honest testimonie: what imputation should this be
vnto me,<note place="margin">Ambros in Psal. 119.</note> 
               <hi>Cum mentem in melius mutare non leuit as sit sed virtus,</hi> sith for a man
to change his minde to the better, it is no leuitie nor inconstancie, (as the
lying Libeller termes it) but vertue? Episcopall gouernment was embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
of this Church ere I was borne, and with it wee enioyed the Gospell
for many yeares, and some that were worthie and faithfull men in this
same Ministrie of <hi>Perth,</hi> wherein I haue now laboured by the grace of God
almost this twentie yeares, did discharge (in effect) the same office of a
Bishop in the bounds of <hi>Galloway,</hi> yea by imposition of their owne hands
did ordaine Bishops of other Dioces. If there were then a reason, why the
Episcopall gouernment once embraced, being fallen in decay, the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall
should be established, is it not now possible (thinke ye) to get a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
why both of them should be reunited, the one of them being ordained
<pb facs="tcp:9463:6"/>
to honour and strengthen the other, and being reduced to that order and
vse, for which anciently it did serue in the Primitiue Church. Especially
seeing it is done by the fatherly fore-cast and prouident care, (not without
warrant of Gods word, example of the Primitiue Church, nor aduice of the
present Church) of such a King as God hath giuen vs, a Professor, a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor,
a Semi-martyt, a Protector, a Preacher, a Propagator of the Gospell
with vs, whose power, for any thing I can yet learne, is greater in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
gouernment of the Church, then we haue well considered of.</p>
            <p>6 O but, say you, by this change, the people are made vncertaine of their
Religion? This cannot be but the bolt of some enemie, or the birth of the
braine of some friend ouer-farre miscaried with opinion. If it hath done euill
to any, it is an argument, their light is weake: for why? doth diuersiue of
externall gouernment import a difference in Religion? Are there not many
famous Churches in Europe, flourishing this day vnder the Episcopall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment?
haue not many Bishops themselues beene honoured with the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of Martyrdome, and sealed the truth of the Gospell with their blood,
since the reformation of Religion: <hi>Latmer, Ridley, Cranmer,</hi> and many moe
in our neighbour Church may stand for examples. I will beseech all such

what the worke of edification requires. For that kinde of externall
gouernment which some Churches of Christ hath, and others hath not:
shall there be entertained a Schisme in our Church? and an vnnecessarie and
vnkindly contention, betweene a Christian people, and their most Christian
King. Since to speake in most modest termes, to giue contentment to such
as are not contentious, there is no question of Faith in the Church of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
(Christian people might be ignorant of this disputation about Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
&amp; come to heauen neuerthelesse, if so it might please some of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors)
neither is there a question betweene good &amp; euill, but betweene good
and better; betweene two, whereof either of them haue had their course to

8 But here I know it is obiected by men, euen of moderate mindes, if
such gouernment were better vsed, and these who haue receiued it, did more

            <p>12 Now here I know it is expected, that as I haue declined the causes
falsly imputed to me, so I should declare the true causes that moued me, which
now shortly are these.</p>
            <p>13 First, I perceiued a Christian King, by all meanes possible, seeking
the aduancement of the Gospell, for the which it is griefe enough that his
Maiestie sustaineth the greatest hatred and contradiction of the aduersaries,
but more then enough, his Highnesse should want the comfort of his subiects,
professors also: which when I considered, I thought it a matter of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to refuse to serue and follow his Maiestie in so good a course.</p>
            <p>14 Secondly, I saw the weake hearts of many well affected Christians,
through misconception, offended at the very name of a Bishop, not able out
of light and knowledge to giue any reason of their misliking, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
though it be so highly honoured by the Apostle, and commended by
the famous lights of the Primitiue Church, who not onely accepted the
name, but exercised the office thereof, to the great good of the Church: and
that this offence might be remoued, at least so farre as my credit may carrie
me, I haue embraced it.</p>
            <p>15 Thirdly, I perceiued a perillous Schisme, and vnnecessarie diuision in
our Church, for this matter of gouernment, to the great aduantage of the
common Aduersarie, which gap I resolued, for my owne part, not to enlarge
by contention, but so farre as my weaknesse may to close it vp, at least to
make it the lesse.</p>
            <p>16 Fourthly, I considered, that the same reason, that of old forced the
Fathers of the Primitiue Church, in the iudgement of <hi>Ierome,</hi> to induce this
gouernment in the Church, that is, in <hi>Remedium Schismatis,</hi> did more then ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly
require that it should be restored vnto vs: but of this the lesse I
speake for duties sake, the more I leaue to be considered of them, who know
the truth hereof.</p>
            <p>17 Fiftly, the question among vs when I searched as narrowly as I
could, is about Ierusalems wall, whether it should be circular or quadrangu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
round or foure-squared: so the Citie be well, is this a matter for which we
<pb facs="tcp:9463:7"/>
should make contention, it being better for the good of the Church, that any
one of them should be, then that thus they should striue together, to the
great hinderance of the Gospell.</p>
            <p>18 Sixtly, and I doe verily thinke that the most famous and reformed
Churches in Europe, who want this gouernment, would be glad to accept it,
vpon this condition, that with it they might enioy the puritie of the Gospel,
which they haue with vs, together with that libertie, fauour and protection
of a Christian reformed King, which we haue, and they want.</p>
            <p>19 For these reasons, as I was determined before, in the priuate calling
of a Preacher, to reuerence and obey others my brethren, clad with the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of Bishops, the proofe whereof I gaue in these Prouinciall assemblies, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated
by Bishops, whereat I was bound to be present, so haue I at length
embraced it in my owne person, being called there-vnto by the most Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
King, and Church of this Kingdome, without any motion, affection,
or petition of mine owne (if there be so much charitie in my aduersaries as
to beleeue me) I could with greater contentment and willingnesse of minde,
haue giuen obedience in all dutifull submission to any of my brethren, nor to
haue had any more publike charge in the Church (if the matter had beene in
my choice.) And this doe I witnesse out of the very truth and simplicitie
of mine heart.</p>
            <p>20 If <hi>Shimei</hi> still will raile, and charge mee with a corrupt affection, let
him be doing till his owne iniquitie reproue him, I am sure no well aduised
Christian will fight with any such armour, for the weapons of our warfare
are not carnall, but spirituall. As for others, who like barking Dogges and
Birds of the night, chatter to themselues in secret confused sounds, which
can bide no triall, back-biting those whom they dare not looke in the face,
for such as these, why shall a man turne out of the way? It is a sufficient pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
to such as this way with their will would hurt mee, that against
their will they shall helpe me,<note place="margin">Aug. cont. liter. Petil. lib. 3. c. 7.</note>

            <p>21 But if such busie idle-bodies will come and labour with mee in the
worke of God, I hope to teach them to bestow their time more profitably,
not to disquiet, as they do, their vnsetled braines with such vanities, as vanish
so soone as they are conceiued, and brought forth, leauing nothing behinde
them but a guiltinesse to themselues, for mine owne part I haue determined
not to be contentious, for that is not the custome of the Church of Christ,

I euer thought it a lamentable thing, that they whose hearts are ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in one resolution to die for Christ, if so the Lord should call them vnto
it, cannot liue together in the vnitie of one minde. But this hath in all ages
beene Sathans policie, where hee cannot disturbe the peace of the Church
with externall euasion, he creepes in like a subtile Serpent, to disquiet it with
internall perturbation, &amp; that oft-times vpon vnnecessarie or small occasions:

and confused, altogether: wherein I must excuse him,
it being hard to keepe such wilde Warriours in rule,
as here he hath hired against me. I haue gone through

raylings, first against my <hi>Name.</hi> 2. against my <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi>

as he seekes me, readie with words of sobernesse and
truth, to resolue him, if hee be readie with like affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to receiue it. But as to his behauiour in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning:
I vvould truly haue dealt vvith him <hi>in the

mee to <hi>come with a rodde;</hi> yea, it is good for him
and others, I should so doe: Since I am a Pastor, and
hee a Sheepe of the Flocke: since hee hath shewed
mee the sore, and protests in vvord hee is content
I should cure it: Since I see his corruption so grosse,
and that the canker thereof is like to eate him vp, I
cannot of dutie but apply the greatest, the sharpest
salt I can get to rectifie it. Excuse mee Master <hi>Dauid,</hi>
though it should bite you, better so, that you may be
mended, then otherwise, that this cankred corruption

Meekenesse alway is not to be vsed: there is a time

but that creature was not, is not, that can
conuict me of receiuing it. And was not Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> a
faithfull seruant of God, a painefull man in the worke
of the Ministrie, yet compelled to plead his cause by
Apologies before men. What shall I say, the Christians
of the primitiue Church were men of a godly life, yet
so sore oppressed with calumnies that <hi>Iustin, Tertullian,</hi>
&amp; other Fathers of the Church were forced to defend
them by Apologies? A worthy, constant, and couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

pleaseth not your humour? I tell you it now therefore
ouer againe: It is Satans policie to staine the Name,
where hee cannot corrupt the Conscience; and to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
the person, by contempt of men, where he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
dishonour them, by trapping them in his owne
snare. Sore hath mine aduersarie thrust at mee, from
my young yeeres, by change of tentations hath hee
sought to winnow mee, if you had read my little Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue,
it could haue told you I haue beene trained vp
with the wrastlings of GOD. Many wayes hath the
Enemie sought to snare me, that he might shame me,
and in shaming me, might shame the glorious Ministrie
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:9463:14"/>
committed to me, though least, and vnworthiest of all
his seruants: But my Lord prayed for mee, and his
grace preserued me, that Satan got no vantage against
mee, to the disaduantage of the Gospell: but now hee
hath changed his battell,<note place="margin">☞</note> and heere is the point; <hi>what
Satan could neuer obtaine of mee by inward tentation, hee
would make the world beleeue by outward calumnie, that he
had obtained it, and that he had made me a man of a corrupt
conscience, and of an vnhonest heart toward God and man.</hi>
Before he fought against mee with inward tentations,
and I resisted him by instant prayer; now he impugnes
me by outward calumnies, he hath not, I thanke God,
corrupted my conscience, but he would make men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
that he had done it: and here it offends M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi>
I should resist the enemie, and defend my selfe by

sober and modest men encline their iudgement to and

you knew it not, nor your complices, therefore it was

I resolued to conforme my selfe, and from that

honouring Bishops priuatelie, publicklie, all that I

Iudge: Is there any in the land, that will be
found more pert, and presumptuous in giuing out rash
iudgement of things secret, which falles not vnder the
iudicatorie of man, then your selfe? Is it possible that
any will come after you, who is able to goe before you
in this impietie? Is this good Diuinitie, or rather is it
not Satans Sophistrie? <hi>Iob</hi> had great riches giuen him
of God, which many poore ones beside him had not,
therefore hee was a mercenarie. The Good-man of
<hi>Gods Croft</hi> hath a Lammer mure, Melene, and many
beside him that loueth God more then he, hath not so
good, therefore the Good-man of <hi>Gods-Croft</hi> is not a
sincere man, hee loueth not God for himselfe, hee is a
mercenarie, or at least may be a mercenarie, which
they cannot be, who haue not receiued so much from
God. Are you not ashamed of this stuffe? And where
you say the Kings reuenewes are diminished, and his
Crowne impouerished, bewray you not your poore
enuie? <hi>Couetousnesse,</hi> saith S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul, is the roote of all euill:
Anger and wrath are cruell,</hi> saith <hi>Salomon, but who can
stand before enuie?</hi> The most couetous man, though he
will not giue of his owne, yet can be content that ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

because the King is good, like another <hi>Constantine,</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
more, then some perhaps are worthie to receiue,
yet no more then a Prince of his qualities is worthie to
giue: and still you complaine that the Crowne is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouerished;
a care, I warrant you, that troubles you
sore: Certainely, it were a pitie you were not his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:9463:43"/>

may not men perceiue you? this is but <hi>Sepiae Atramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi>
hides you not, but layeth you open, that all men
may see you. If your Crowne had not returned from
Court so clipped as it did, but some streames of his
royall liberalitie flowed ouer it, to water it, and make
it encrease, then should not the <hi>Crowne be impouerished.</hi>
But what Crowne I told you not.</p>

M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Dauid</hi> is in this imputation: wee will looke backe a

of the Church, which sacrilegious men had taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
might be restored againe. They sought it, and
could not obtaine it. Now a Christian King freely of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers

I should not haue troubled you with this my

I pray you patiently to heare, and iudge of me, as you
will answere to God, for vnto you in that head, I sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit

God, nor good men in that which hitherto hath been
laid to my charge. And now Brethren, because the
daily decay of naturall strength, threatneth vnto mee
certaine, and sodaine departure from the miserie of this

of God I charge and commaund you, that you take

you must make account, and resist that tyrannie as you
would auoid hells fire. This battell I graunt will be
hard, but the second part will be harder; that is, that
with the like vprightnesse and strength in God, you

you not with their sinnes, of whatsoeuer estate
they be, neither by consent, nor yet by silence, but by
publicke protestation make this knowne vnto the
world, that you are innocent of such robberie: which
will ere it be long prouoke Gods vengeance vpon the

learned, but without that experience and wisedome
which may make them meete for gouernment: and it

who made the Gospell to be preached there where it
was not heard in our daies, nor in the daies of our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers?
was it any Presbyterie? I doubt not they would
but could not: you will finde it was the diligence and
fidelitie of a Bishop. I may say further that in sundrie
parts of the high Land, the name of Christ is brought
in reuerence, by the care of Bishops, where it was not
knowne before, in such bounds as haue not beene vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sited

nor Presbiterie before this. I could tell you of a meane
Bishop, who hath made a constant prouision of three

their former stipends: and this care of the continuance
of the Gospell after vs, you cannot denie to be a good

willingly, then euer I did the other, not for any vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse

that no man hath, or doth accept a Bishopricke, being
rather willing to want it? So you speake out of your

other men with your spanne, but I am sure the
minde of an honest Bishop or Pastor is a more high
and diuine thing then that you <hi>G.</hi> are able to iudge it.
How many worthy men of the Primitiue Church, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
that they thought the office lawfull, yet
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:9463:47"/>
haue fled it, and denyed it, till they haue beene forced
by the Church to accept it: yea, some haue dismem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
themselues that they might eschew it. I know
their preposterous zeale is not commendable, yet good
enough to improue you, that euery one who alloweth
a Bishoprie is not euer willing to accept it. But you
thinke these men are not now adaies; and seeing it is
so, that such as like it will make no scruple to accept
it, you might soone doe worse then fall to and studie
the lawfulnesse of Episcopall Gouernement your selfe.
Beleeue mee, if you lay aside your preiudicate minde,
you will easily learne it, and then without difficultie
I see you will accept it your selfe (if you may get it.)
Poesie prospers not with you, I meane, it renders you
not wished contentment; though you haue skill in it,
yet you know there is one before you that hath the
praise of <hi>Prince of Poets:</hi> but if once you could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to be a Bishop, who doth know what good you
might doe to your selfe and the whole Church? There
is no impediment, but that you are not a Pastor; yet
the consideration of your learning, wherein you excell
many Pastors, might purchase to you some speciall
priuiledge, and be a motiue to others to draw you out
in publike like another <hi>Ambrose,</hi> who for his singular
learning and pietie was taken from the Barre, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced

speake of the name, doe I disioyne it from the

expresly knit the name of a Bishop, and his office to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
But you will haue all Pastors called Bishops,
and then the name will be honoured of all. Mr. <hi>Dauid,</hi>
we know that in a generall sense, all Pastors comes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the name of Bishops, Prophets, &amp;c. Which for all
that derogates nothing to the distinction of their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:9463:49"/>
and offices, and powers in gouernement. This is
a common argument, vsed against Episcopall authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
but in truth of no strength: for why? Doth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of names take away proprieties of things? The
blessed Spirits in heauen are called Angels, the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Bishops of the Church in earth, called Angels al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so.
Will you inferre of this an equalitie among them?
All Christians are called Kings and Priests to their
God, will it therefore follow that there is not a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
kingly and priestly Office, proper to some, not
common to all?</p>
               <p>

is giuen vnto one Pastor, (it being his calling to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see

that the name of a Bishop and Superintendent, are one
in the pith of signification, the one being but a Latine
word, expressing the equiualent of it in Greeke? and
as their names are one, so their powers also are one;

where-vnto also that I doe him no wrong, I thinke
his owne words shall leade vs. But say you, there was
no Schisme, till Bishops came, they haue made it, not
remedied it: This double calumnie is answered very

a Christian King requires the wall to be repaired,
and that vpon reason; yea, forced thereunto of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie;
is it not better that Pastors and people in this
should obey their King, then otherwise by refusing and
resisting, should procure, and continue a needlesse de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baite
betweene a Prince of such knowledge and pietie,
and his people; betweene a King and his Church, and
betweene faithfull, zealous, godly, and learned Pastors
among themselues? And now M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Dauid</hi> thinke shame
that you professe to haue so great respect to a sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

rather then a simple Labourer be hurt say you, let
the building stand: rather then a singular King be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
say I, let the wall be renued. Where pride is,
where fectlesse and needlesse contention is, whether
with you or vs, I leaue it to the consideration of the
Christian and iudicious Reader. What regard the
auncient Fathers of our Church had to his Maiestie
in his minoritie; how loath any way to make his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
regent, and the Lords of Counsell their partie,
by giuing them any cause of offence, the monuments
of our Church can witnesse. But now the pleasure or
displeasure of a Christian King in his old age is nothing
regarded: yea, it is maintained for an Axiome, that
Christ his Kingdome is dishonoured, when helpe is
sought from the arme of a Christian King. I thanke
God what euer my minde was in Church-gouernment,
I knew not, I loued not, such foolish pride. Then I
thought out of simplicitie, that euery mans minde had
beene like mine owne: seeing I see it is otherwise, and far
otherwise, they must excuse me to mislike in them, that
which I neuer loued in my selfe, that is, a proud con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
of singular sinceritie, a disdaine of others, a delight

in needlesse contention, and a misregard of a Christian

mine owne misconceptions of that estate, but neuer
thought, farre lesse taught, that the stile and name of
Bishops was to be abhorred. And albeit you thinke I
taught much in that Sermon against Bishops, yet I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
more iudicious hearers then you, who were
familiar with mee, maruelled I had spoken so little;
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:9463:64"/>
the iust copie of the Sermon is yet extant, and when I
looke vnto it, I maruell at it, and reuerence the Lords
prouidence, who then directed mee to a conclusion,
wherein yet I remaine, for so were my words. <hi>That we

I had no leasure to reade it, like as I neuer read it: they
tolde mee it contained nothing but a supplication for
continuance of Church-gouernment, that then was.
And as I haue said, at that time I could willingly haue
contented; yea, contended for it as I might, that our
gouernment might continue, fearing euer least the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
course had beene to abolish it; but from the time
I perceiued that the course was not to disanull any
substantiall point of Discipline which we had, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to roberate it, by restoring againe Episcopall power,
whereby I perceiued the Church not weakened but
strengthened, not preiudiced but confirmed in all her
lawfull libertie, I reproued my selfe of my former folly,
and not onely consented vnto it, but the more I loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
into it, the more I loued it, reioycing at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment
of Preachers for this end, and in honouring
of them esteemed my selfe honoured. And if the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed

the most pure Doctrine, the most perfect Discipline,
who can secure himselfe that none euill shall follow
it: Since in Paradise in the state of innocencie, a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
followed <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Euah,</hi> and corrupted them,
We are vpon earth, like Passengers on the Sea, were
the winde and weather neuer so faire, yet are they not

they know there may be a change: and shall wee

to set downe that forme of gouernement in the
Church, of the which wee may be sure, without all
feare, none euill shall follow it? Is none euill to be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
to follow Presbyteriall gouernement? what you
haue enquired of the one, let me aske of you the other:
can all the faults, offences, sloaths of Presbyteries, in
not assembling to the weekely exercise, with diuisions,
disobediences, be knowne to his Maiestie? it is more
apparant, the faults of one, are sooner knowne, sooner
dilated, sooner corrected, then the ouer-sights of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie:
neither is it likely, that Bishops shall escape with
their smallest offences, so long as you and such as you,
are their captors and inspectors, dogging them at the
heeles, treading after them in all their foot-steps, glad
when you may heare or see any weakenesse in them,
that you lay hold vpon greedily, making much of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
that you may disgrace them. Is not this to imitate
Satans nature? is it not contrarie to the conditions of
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:9463:67"/>
elect Angels? they reioyce at the conuersion of a
sinner, you with Satan reioyce at their fall: it doth
you more good then your meate or drinke, to heare
any blame you may impute to a Bishop. God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue
you.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="117"/> But to returne, sure it is, no carefull, no conscio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
man can liue in any state without feare: for why?
Satan seekes most carefully and cunningly to corrupt
Offices most excellent, and most profitable for the
Church, and the greater good be in them so long as
they abide good, the greater euill comes of them when
they begin to change: Euen as the finest wine turnes
into the sharpest vinegar. How then shal a man be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
feare? but I nothing doubt it is in his Maiestie his

all euils, specially tyrannie, libertie, briberie, partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,

vnlawfull in this Church of Scotland; 3. Vnprofitable
in it importing tyrannie, and is it selfe tyrannie; 4. Doth and

in the Countrey, with Papistry, senslessenes, Atheisme: some
that thought wel of it in the beginning, thinke worse of it now.
Consider the experience in boldning Papists in so vnlookt for
manner, so many witnesses in our chiefe Towne since Bishops
got gouernment, as was not nor durst not be in all Scotland
when Presbyteries had gouernment. Now Corruption flowes

Is it not still a Mother Church? Is not the way

Preachers of whom you are vnworthie? Is there
any defection in it from any point of truth? How then
defaced? By Masses (say you) said in it. Were they pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke?
You dare not affirme it. Were they stollen in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret?
You cannot denie it, and yet discouered by the
vigilant care of their Bishop and Pastors. Thankes to
God, such abhomination dare not be auouched there.
Is this a defacing of that Church? No: it is a detract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of yours, no defacing of them; yea, rather it is their
great commendation, that in so populous a Citie
scarce twelue are found miscarried by seducers, and
those also of no credit nor countenance; who, vvhen

it of simple ignorance, and that they abhor the Masse

find you not the contrarie? that the Bishop of Ephesus,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:9463:71"/>
called there the Angell, is commended, for that he had
examined them, and found them to be lyars. If the
Church of Edenburgh had fallen away (which GOD

a false Prophetesse to teach and deceiue the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants

fall out) that Sathan had a Throne there, as he had
in Pergamus, yet seeing there is a Church that will not
denie the faith, no though <hi>Antipas</hi> should be slaine,
how say you the face of the Church is defaced? But the
contrarie is manifest, Satan may creepe in there like a
thiefe (thanks be to God) he hath no throne there: what
villanie can hee worke, which they punish not? Can
you say any of their Magistrates, Councellors, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
Elders, Deacons, or any honourable man of the
body of their Citie, is stained with that Heresie? How
then is the face of their Church defaced? And truely,
though that many such were among them (as you haue
said) which yet is not, it were no maruell to mee, when
I remember the Apostles saying; <hi>There must be Heresies,
that such as are approued may be tryed?</hi> Where there is
no winde to carrie chaffe away, how shall the Corne
be discerned? where there is no Heresie how shall they
be knowne who are confirmed in veritie, rooted and
grounded so in Christ, stablished and built vpon the
rocke, that no winde of contrarie doctrine can carrie

to reason, you should haue disproued Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
gouernment before you had condemned it; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that you haue condemned it, is it not your shame
to remit it to further reasoning? In the one you haue
shewed superfluitie of malice, mouing you to speake
euill of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the other penurie of knowledge, that you
haue no reason to iustifie you in the condemning of it.
Thus haue you shewed your selfe, <hi>in initio confident em, in
facto timidum;</hi> one that feareth to fight, but is bold to
bragge. You will not simplie giue ouer the combat,
but declines it farely for this time, and puts it off to a
better time: but in my minde a better time could you
neuer haue had then this, seeing you haue gathered
your friends, and haue mustered you Armie, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
it out of your ripest wits in sixe sheetes of paper
before you; what a shame is it, that in so feeble manner
you should turne your backe, and leaue all that you
haue sent and said before? You haue braued a Bishop in
presence of your friends, now hee stands before you,
and you dare not looke him in the face, nor strike one
stroke at him in this quarrell, that the office of a Bishop
is vnlawfull in it selfe.</p>
               <p>But to pursue you euen to the vttermost point,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="132"/>
wherevnto you haue fled; in this also you shew your
selfe weake, yea, ridiculous: for now you haue drawne
all your speech to this Assertion, and I pray the iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Reader to consider it, <hi>Howsoeuer Episcopall Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment
in it selfe be lawfull or vnlawfall to other Churches,
or sometime lawfull in our owne Church, yet it is not lawfull
now.</hi> A Paradoxe indeede: I thinke M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Dauid</hi> speakes
not simplie, but grants it by concession. But taking it
as hee giues it, let vs heare it ouer againe, <hi>Though Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall
gouernement in it selfe were lawfull, lawfull to other
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:9463:75"/>
Churches, lawfull once to our owne Church, yet now it is not
lawfull.</hi> To proue this, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Dauid</hi> brings two Reasons,
which had neede to be very strong, it being a strange
Position they haue to defend: but the Reader shall by
Gods grace see it made plaine, that there is no more
truth, worth, nor value in his two Reasons, then in the
rest of his Assertions. And since the whole weight of
the Controuersie stands vpon these two Reasons, I set
them downe truely to you, as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Dauid</hi> hath set them

I will onely present a view of their weaknesse
to the Reader, in these words. In the Confession of faith,
sworne and subscribed by the Preachers and Professors
of this Land, they haue <hi>abiured the Popes wicked and
worldly Hierarchie.</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Dauid</hi> leauing out the <hi>differences
of Papall, wicked, worldly,</hi> makes mention onely of <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchie:</hi>
which, in it selfe, signifies an authoritie or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratiue
power in things sacred: Who will abiure this?
but to declare their meaning, they added these three
differences, <hi>Papall, worldly, wicked:</hi> but M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Dauid</hi> to
declare how hee distrusts his owne cause, deceiueth
the simple, by putting in into his Reason the Word
<hi>Hierarchie</hi> onely. By this, any indifferent Reader may
see that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Dauid</hi> deales not truely, nor faithfully, nor
like a man defending a good cause, but fore-seeing that
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:9463:75"/>
these words would destroy his Assertion, of purpose he
leaues them out.</p>
                  <p>His second Reason is without reason, and against
the very rules of reasoning. This is <hi>Petitio principij,</hi> he
begs the question, and takes it for a principle, which is
the Controuersie it selfe, as shall appeare in our impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation.
I will not be presumptuous to dispute that
which is concluded alreadie, and past in a Law. Onely

Your other Obiection is, Superintendents had their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="138"/>
Office from the Church: did their Office by aduise of
their Brethren, and were countable to the Church
for it. Tell me I pray you, what else see you in Bishops?
Their Office and power is from the Church, their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
preferment, their rent and maintenance, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
by the King; yea, good reason it is that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie
haue the nomination of a Bishop, out of lytes of

here? You will finde the nomination of Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents

                        </gap> they gaue them their maintenance,
see Act of Assemblie, <hi>An.</hi> 1562. Againe, Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents

Ministers of the bounds. The same stands now,
and can you say that any Bishop in our Church stands
against this, except onely that where the Law bindes
them to vse the aduise of three, they vse the aduise of
sixe, or tenne, or thirteene if they may get them? What
can you say against this M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Dauid?</hi> See you not here
a constant forme of gouernment in our Church? See
you any other Bishops now then were in the dayes of
<hi>Iohn Knox?</hi> Here say you, Superintendents were
changeable? but you should haue cleared your selfe,
not deceiued the simple people vnder ambiguitie of
words. Tell the truth, were any of them changed in
their time, or was there any cause might haue taken
from them the office of a Superintendent, but such as
might haue also depriued of the Office of Preaching
and all other offices in the Church? In which case Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendents,
Bishops, and Pastors, both might and
should lawfully be deposed; but God be praised such
examples feil not out in our Church.</p>

subiect to the censure of Ministers, ouer whom they
had the inspection? The contrarie is true, our Fathers
foresaw the perill of that, and exempted them from it;
reseruing them to be iudged by the generall Assemblie,
as I haue cleared before: and doubtlesse there could
be no order where such as should correct the faults of
others, are put vnder the censure of thos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> that should
be corrected by them.</p>
                     <p>You still reply, there is now (say you) no generall
Assemblie to censure them: but you may know that the
same Law which restoreth the Iurisdiction of Bishops,
ratifieth also generall Assemblies, howbeit in a refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
State, the power to call it belongs to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Magistrate, and seeing it is the Parliament of the
Church, the great Ecclesiastique Councell of the
Church, the calling of it, except vpon very vrgent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions,
proueth often more hurtfull then helpfull, but
where great and weightie causes require it, you may be
sure the Prince will not refuse it.</p>
                     <p>But your great grudge is here, that Bishops are not
vnder the power of Ministers to be cast out of their
places by pluralitie of voices You dreame of an assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie
that would finde the authoritie vnlawfull, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose

not so affected, they see the necessitie and vtilitie of
this calling: they who disliked it at the first, are now

                     <p>In a word, let it be told you in name of all the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops

by the generall Assemblie, ratified by our most Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
King and States of the Kingdome. Our care is to
discharge it in the best sort wee can, when wee haue
done all that is possible for vs, there are many of you
ready so farre as you may to vndoe it, out of an euill
humor, more narrowly looking to negligences then to
obserue paines and good diligence: wee are men, and
may fall as others, but our faults should not be abused
to condemne our function, more then the faults of
Ministers condemne their Ministrie. We claime no li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
but are readie by Gods grace, to answere all our
Superiours, and be censured by them as the meanest
in the Church. And we carrie this humble minde, that
if you, or any other, in loue and good affection, will

you by reason, or willingly amend it: yet so that
wee will maintaine the honour of our charge and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and not leaue it free for euery man to raile against

they are presently made in this Realme, where-vnto the

is it, that the Oath of some, albeit they had made it (as
you say) which will not be found, should binde others
that made it not.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, when it was appointed by act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="146"/>

which therein at length is exprest, should be sworne

which then was in our Church was Episcopall, for
the Oath and subscription is ordained to be made in
presence of the Archbishop, Superintendent, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioner

he will reuerence them, and thinke shame of his owne
folly: when M. <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> got license from our gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall

with him of this tenour: <hi>The Superintendents, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners

<hi>Antichristian Hierarchie?</hi> Do they not plainely dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyne
them, writing to Bishops that had renounced the

was then in her infancie; it may be you make them
all Infants: all the worthie, learned, and vnspotted
Superintendents of our Church, <hi>Iohn Willok</hi> Superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendent

M. <hi>Hay,</hi> with many more I cannot name, present at the

where a man of your experience comes out: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue

                     <p>Now as this sense, which you make of the word <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchie,</hi>

is against the minde of our first Fathers; so is
it against the minde of the swearers and subscribers:
and are you not a foule abuser to inforce vpon them
a sense whereof they thought neuer? This is cleere as
the light. For why, did not his Maiestie sweare and
subscribe that confession of Faith? This was his royall
and most Christian oath, offered to God in defence of
his truth. Did not his Highnesse there, and at many
other times, professe openly a renunciation of that
wicked <hi>Hierarchie?</hi> Will you inferre vpon this, that his
Maiestie therefore abiured Episcopall gouernement?
I dare appeale to your owne knowledge, hath not his
Maiestie kept one constant iudgement concerning
Church-gouernement euer from his young yeeres?
doth not the inhibition of nouation in Church-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement
cleere this? doth not the publike printed
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:9463:81"/>
Declaration of his Highnesse intention proue it? doth
not all his Highnesse speeches, and actions, before the
subscription, since the subscription, declare his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
approbation of Episcopal gouernement? and yet
you would make it to be beleeued of the people, that
his Highnesse renounced Episcopall gouernement,
when his Maiestie renounced <hi>Hierarchie, vsurped, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall,
wicked:</hi> this, or else a worse, must be the drift of
your language. Truly you may thanke God you haue
to doe with a clement and gratious king. And that
this same which is his Highnesse mind of that Article,
is also the minde of most part of the ancient teachers,
and other brethren, learned, godly, vnspotted, who
haue well deserued of the Church present, by fidelitie
in their ministrie, will bee cleared also: I will not goe
about in any inordinate manner to seeke subscriptions
to this purpose, but when it shall be required by order
in the Church, you will finde a cloud of witnesses
standing against you, to improue this calumnie of
yours: yea, many times in my younger yeeres haue I
heard famous and auncient Fathers of our Church,
who haue seene the first beginnings thereof, affirme,
that our Church could not consist vnlesse Episcopall
gouernement were restored againe: this they spake
when there was no appearance of it, and when Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall

whom it is thought <hi>Augustine</hi> was one, to proue that

of the most auncient Copies of the Councell of
Nice, his fraudulent vsurpation was discouered, and he
warmed by these Fathers neuer to attempt any such
thing in time to come. Many reasons they gaue him (as
indeede they had all reason for it) specially this, that
the grace of the holy Ghost, had not with-drawne it

I absolued this answere to it; what time hath ouerpast
since, hath beene spent in writing it ouer and ouer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine

it is best so, for others and me also, to ease me of much
paines of priuate writing, wherein I cannot giue euery

great losse, beside my instant labour, being forced, all
this time to intermit mine ordinarie exercise of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at Euening Prayer: wherein I know you haue
done more euill to this people, then I thinke you haue
done good to any Congregation in the Land: but if
eyther my paines or their losse (for this time) may serue

I thinke they will esteeme vantage; if not, yet I hope it
shall doe good vnto others.</p>
                     <p>And now in the end, albeit M. <hi>Dauid</hi> doe shunne the

                     <p>There are some godly and learned men in the
Church, who maintaine Episcopall gouernment to be
<hi>iuris diuini,</hi> of diuine authoritie: there are others, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Light of the Church also, who albeit they thinke
it not to be <hi>iuris diuini,</hi> but <hi>humani</hi> or <hi>Ecclesiastici,</hi> and

Ecclesiastique, yet they reuerence it as a good, and a

                     <p>If M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Dauid</hi> will not adioyne himselfe to the first, I
wish at least, hee would betake himselfe to the modest
iudgement of the second; and consider what a grieuous
sinne it is to nourish a Schisme in the Church, for such
a matter, and how far the famous Lights of our time
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:9463:84"/>
mislike them who spare not to diuide the Church, for

               <p>My faith leanes first of all and simply vpon the
word of God, thereafter also it something depends vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the common consent of the whole ancient Church,
where it is not repugnant to the holy Scripture. For
I beleeue those things which by godly Fathers, assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
in the name of the Lord, haue beene concluded,
decreed, and receiued, not contradictorie vnto holy
Scripture, and that those same things also, albeit they
be not of equall authoritie with the holy Scripture,
haue proceeded from the holy Spirit: whereof it comes
to passe, that I neither will, nor dare in a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
contradict them. For, what is more certaine
out of Histories, Councels, and the writings of all Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,

that godly gouernours of Churches and Schooles by

Church; partly also, that they who by publicke testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie

they reuerence it as a necessarie and lawfull policie,
which may make most iustly the malecontents of our

that the office of a Bishop is Antichristian, that the

no time for such idle toyes, and I maruell how men can
so farre misconstrue my words; for I affirmed plainely

I thanke the Lord; these labours of mine pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished

translation, rendring the words in this manner, <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem

beene vsed heere as an Adiectiue, the Apostle would
haue said <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, to make it agree with <gap reason="foreign">

because it doth not so significantly expresse
the Apostles meaning: it being more to say the sense
of the flesh is inimitie with God, then to say, it is an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie

sense, haue vsed <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> as an Adiectiue substantiuated

you, modest and reasonable men will excuse you for

               <p>And truly I haue great cause to thanke the Lord
my God, that so many eyes and tongues, and Pennes
being stretched out to marke my wayes: my words,
my secret writings; my publicke writings yet among
them all they can finde nothing either in my life, or
in my labours wherewith to charge me: if they could,
the world should haue heard it ere now: yea, since
some of them haue beene so impious, as to iudge of
Gods affection toward me by the death of some of my
children, which I know hath beene tratled into the
eares of some within <hi>Edenburgh.</hi> What would these who
so narrowly seekes a blame against mee, haue done if
they could haue found it? Againe, I thanke the Lord
who hath so watched ouer me, as not to suffer mee to
fall vnder the rebuke of man. I feare not, I care not the
censure of flesh, and I trust in his grace, that still hee
will preserue me pure and blamelesse to his heauenly
Kingdome for his names sake.</p>

bending your tongues in publicke and priuate against

vpon your reputation. Thinke it no shame to submit
your selfe to Episcopall gouernement; to receiue it in
the Church, which the plaine euidence of truth forces
your selfe to confesse, that it was set vp in our Church
by the oldest and best Fathers that euer our Church
had. But if still you will be contentious, and foster a
diuision, if you will depriue this poore Church of the
good wee might haue vnder so Christian a King, so

the Gospell: if you haue no respect to encrease his

this one place, among many, may witnesse: for he not
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:9463:100"/>
onely affirmes that the power of a Bishop ouer Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters
is more auncient then his time, but that it is war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted
also by diuine authoritie.</p>
               <p>I could to this same purpose bring many others, if
at this time I might attaine to my owne minutes, col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
for helpe of my memorie. But let these suffice
for the present. If they content you not, then I send
you to the fourth Booke of <hi>Douname,</hi> wherein hee
proueth Episcopall Function to be of Apostolicall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,
because it was generally receiued in the first
three hundred yeeres after the Apostles. If you be
purposed to dispute this question, you will finde him
there with very formall and forcible reasonings defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Episcopall gouernement: if you will not, as I
thinke you will not meddle with him, because hee is
too strong for you, then you shall doe best to let alone
your whisperings in the eares of simple people, and
your triuiall arguments which seeme good enough to
them that know no better, but in very deede are like
the Cuties of bone wherewith Children shoote in the
streetes, that may well make a little fize with powder,
but are not able to carrie any Bullet, and it will be long
before you hurt a Bishop with such.</p>
               <p>You carp at my Argument <hi>fol.</hi> 9. that I bring to
proue the externall D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>scipline to be arbitarie and
changeable, as may best serue for edification, because
the Apostles, in a greater matter, dispensed with Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision
for edification, some of them retayning it,
some not admitting it, as they saw best for the state of
their people. You neede not tell mee that Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
was a Sacrament, and no point of Church-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment,
I know that very vvell: but must tell you
againe, that as quicke as you thinke your selfe, you
mistake the argument; for, it is from the more to the
lesse: If the Apostles vsed a diuersitie in a greater thing,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:9463:100"/>
for the good of the Church, and did not all keepe one
rule concerning the Sacrament of Circumcision;
why shall it be thought euill now to see diuersitie in
the Church about a lesse thing? some Churches vsing
externall gouernment one way, others another way, as
the state of the time and people requires. Besides that,
I beleeued your Doctorship had beene so acquainted,
at least with the recent Writers of this age, that you
would haue soone perceiued the Author of the words
alledged by mee to be <hi>Musculus</hi> on 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. and his
probation of it, is not from auncient <hi>Augustine,</hi> as
you take it, but from the latter <hi>Augustana Confessio;</hi> put
on your Spectacles and reade it againe. Thus while as
like a blinde man you would strike at mee, you strike a
more worthy man then euer you were, and a vvhole
reformed Church also. Yet for all this, your vvords
are oracles good enough (I warrant you) in your owne
Conuenticles, and with them the simplicitie of many
Christians is abused, whose eyes I pray the Lord open,
that as they know the truth of the Gospell, so they may
know the truth of this question also, and leaue off to
rend this Church by so vnlawfull a diuision.</p>
               <p>That you affirme no Schisme was in our Church
till Bishops came. I must tell you this is but your ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnie,
and the contrarie is notoriously knowne: to
mee it is cleare as the light; with a mourning heart ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
a time haue I looked vnto one, I could make it
cleare to the world, but I will not for all your prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
I say no more, but if you be ignorant of this,
you are a great stranger in S. <hi>Andrewes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Your Discourses <hi>fol.</hi> 10. 11. 12. 13. are answered al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie.
In the 14 you condemne the calling of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
of this Church, they neyther haue it from the
people, nor the Church, nor the generall Assemblie.
Surely, you are a pert affirmer of any thing you please,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:9463:101"/>
for you will not finde any Bishop of Scotland, whom
the generall Assemblie hath not first nominated and
giuen vp in lytes to that effect, or else by such as haue
authoritie in the Church to doe it.</p>
               <p>In your <hi>fol.</hi> 15. you vsurpe the iudgement of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
and therein vtters the pride of your spirit, but
impaires not mine honest inward testimonie in the
contrarie. I affected no Bishoprie, no creature can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince
me of <hi>Ambitus,</hi> directly nor indirectly: but you
must be like your selfe, affirme falshoods confidently,
that your simple ones may beleeue you: neuerthelesse
know that God will bring you to iudgement, and you
shall be countable, if for your idle words, much more
for your false lying words, spoken and published for
the corrupting of others.</p>
               <p>My words against the lying Libeller you wickedly
and most wrongfully wrest against my brethren, God
forgiue you; I haue answered it alreadie.</p>
               <p>And where in your last leafe you runne out vpon
your comparisons, that those who haue laboured more
faithfully and fruitfully in the worke of GOD then I
haue done, could teach mee how to behaue my selfe
in the house of God, though now (say you) I seeme
to my selfe a great Doctor in Israell. All this is but
needlesse talke: I refuse not to be taught of any in the
Church, I haue learned some good from any that
euer I heard, and haue taken paines to keepe it: but
what I seeme to be in mine owne eies is hard for you to
know. When in the secret of my heart I deale vvith
my God, I know my roome, that I am the chiefe of
sinners, and least of Saints; and in truth I so esteeme
my selfe: but where you will come in, and out of your
pride, runne ouer mee, and treade my gift vnder
your feete, I will not suffer you. It is not mine owne,
and I got it not from you I will speake in defence of it,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:9463:101"/>
and not let you disgrace it. I haue by the grace of God,
laboured as faithfully, diligently, and I trust also fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
as you, or any with you that haue stretched the
penne against mee. Hee that made mee a Doctor in
Israell, hath taught mee that which I neuer learned
from man, and wherewith you, if you were well tryed
would be found vnacquainted.</p>
               <p>Some of your sort, I wot not if it be your selfe, haue
beene carping at my works in a publicke Sermon to
the people. S. <hi>Luke</hi> (saith hee) when hee wrote the
Historie of the <hi>Acts,</hi> dedicates it simplie to <hi>Theophilus,</hi>
but some Writers of our time must in their Dedicatorie
Epistles premit honourable Stiles: Is not this thinke
you, good Diuinitie? But the reputation of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
maketh any thing good enough that hee liketh
to speake. But if hee read the Booke through, before
hee beganne to expound it, hee might haue marked
that S. <hi>Paul</hi> speaking to <hi>Festus,</hi> giues him an honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Stile,<note place="margin">Acts 26. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>O Noble Festus!</hi> What will hee say vvhen
hee comes to that place? If it had beene eyther He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie,
or flatterie, or vnlawfull, in it selfe, to giue Stiles
of honour to honourable men, S. <hi>Paul</hi> would not haue
vsed it. And hee who did obserue this lesson on Saint
<hi>Lukes</hi> speech to <hi>Theophilus,</hi> did but abuse his hearers,
and wrong the absent whose workes hee would faine
disgrace, for a misliking of himselfe.</p>
