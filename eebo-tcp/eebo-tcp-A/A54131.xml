            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>OF THE
General Rule
OF
Faith and Practice.</head>
            <p>SInce there are ſo many <hi>Faiths</hi> in the World,
and perplex Controverſies about them;
and that it greatly behoveth every Man, if
to Contend for, then firſt to Know the <hi>True
Faith</hi> that overcometh the World; it may
not be unneceſſary to ſay ſomething of the
<hi>General Rule of Faith and Life, and Judge of
Controverſie,</hi> at this time. And indeed I am
preſt from this weighty Conſideration, that
Men periſh for want of it, and can no more
arrive at Truth without it, than the diſtreſſed
Marriner can gain his Port who Sails with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
either Star or Compaſs.</p>
            <p>I ſhall begin with an Explanation of the
Terms, <hi>Rule,</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi> of which we ſhall
firſt treat, that we may as well expreſs what
we intend by the one, as what we mean by
the other, which will be a proper Introducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the whole Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>By</hi> General Rule, <hi>&amp;c. we underſtand, that</hi>
Conſtant Meaſure or Standard, by which Men in
all Ages have been enabled to Judge of the Truth
or Error of Doctrines, and the Good or Evil of
Thoughts, Words and Actions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:98325:3"/>
               <hi>By</hi> Faith <hi>we underſtand an</hi> Aſſent of the
Mind, in ſuch manner to the Diſcoveries made
of God thereto, as to reſign up to God, and have
Dependence upon him, as the Great Creator and
Saviour of his People; <hi>which is inſeparable
from good Works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That Men, in all Ages, have had a Belief
of God, and ſome Knowledge of him, tho'
not upon equal Diſcovery, muſt be granted
from that account that all Story gives of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
in matters of Religion; ſeveral have
fully performed this: Of old, <hi>Juſtin Martyr,
Clemens Alexandrinus, Auguſtine,</hi> and others;
of latter times, <hi>Du Pleſſy, Grotius, Amiraldus,
L. Herbert,</hi> and above all Dr. <hi>Cudworth:</hi> And
indeed the relicks we have of the moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Hiſtorians and Authors, are a Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
in the Point. Now the Scripture
tells us,<note place="margin">

                  </gap>7.</note> that no Man knows the Father but
the Son, and he to whom the Son reveals
him:<note place="margin">Cor. 2. 1.</note> And as none knows the things of Man,
ſave the Spirit of Man; ſo the things of God
knows no Man, but the Spirit of God.
Hence we may ſafely conclude, that the
Creating Word that was with God, and was
God, in whom was Life, and that Life the
<hi>Light of Men,</hi> and who is the Quickning Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
was <hi>He,</hi> by whom God in all Ages hath
revealed Himſelf; conſequently, that Light or
Spirit muſt have been the <hi>General Rule</hi> of Mens
Knowledge, Faith and Obedience, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
to God. And thus much <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> who
liv'd about Six Hundred Years before thoſe
Words were ſpoke or writ, laid down for a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98325:3"/>
Maxim, <hi>viz.</hi> That no Man can know what
is agreeable to God, <hi>except a Man hear God
himſelf,</hi> and that muſt be within; for that
was his Doctrine. To which the Apoſtle
and Prophet thus agree: 1. In that <hi>what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
makes manifeſt is Light.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 5. 1</note> 2. That <hi>what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever

<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hat the Scriptures are not plain, but to the

            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:98325:7"/>
This was the Caſe of Chriſt's Diſciples,
who had no particular Rule in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament
Writings, for the aboliſhing of ſome
part of the Old Teſtament Religion: On the
contrary they might have pleaded for the
<hi>Perpetuity</hi> of it, becauſe Chriſt ſaid unto
them, <hi>Do as they ſay that ſit in</hi> Moſes<hi>'s Chair<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
more reaſonably than many who make that

What then guided them in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring

For Inſtance,<note place="margin">Gen. 17.</note> God gave Circumciſion <hi>as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

them nothing:</hi> Was not this the Spirit of Truth
that leads into all Truth, that the Apoſtle
made the Judge and Rule of their Doctrine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
and Practices? So ſaid <hi>James</hi> and the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly
of the Apoſtles, when they told the
Believers,<note place="margin">Acts 25. 26.</note> 
               <hi>It ſeemed good to the Holy Ghoſt and

            <p>5. Theſe very Men that ſay <hi>it is the Rule

their Aſſertion, for the Scriptures no where
ſay ſo of themſelves. Here they fly to
Meanings and Interpretations: The Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
ariſes not about the Truth of the
Text, for that is agreed on all hands;
but the Expoſition of it: If then I yield to
that Man, do I bow to the Letter of the
Text, or to his Interpretation? If the Lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
as manifeſtly I do, is the Scripture o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <hi>that Man's Senſe</hi> of it my Rule? Nay the
Perſon ſo interpreting makes not the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:98325:7"/>
his Rule but his own Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
whatever he may ſay to gain Credit
to his Conceptions with others; then
Mine it muſt needs be, I conſenting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>
            <p>6. How ſhall I be aſſured that theſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
came from God? I am bound to try
all things: If all things, then Them amongſt
the reſt. I would fain know what I muſt
try them with? with the Scriptures? Then
the Scriptures muſt be the Rule of my Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination,
and Faith concerning themſelves,
which is improper: If with the Spirit that
gave them forth, which ſearcheth the deep
things of God (a meaſure of which is given
to me to profit withal) Then is it moſt
congruous to call the Spirit, by way of
<hi>Excellency,</hi> and not the Scriptures, <hi>The
Rule.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. If the Scriptures are the Rule, they
muſt be ſo in the <hi>Original,</hi> or <hi>Copies:</hi> If in
the <hi>Original,</hi> that is not extant, and ſo there
would be no Rule in being; for the laſt of
it that was extant, was the Evangeliſt <hi>John</hi>'s
Hiſtory at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> not ſeen almoſt theſe
thouſand Years: If the <hi>Copies</hi> muſt be the
<hi>Rule,</hi> it were to be wiſhed we knew which
were the nigheſt to the Original, there being
above <hi>Thirty</hi> in Number: This is undeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,
and for ought we ſee Indetermina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
And that which further confirms what
I ſay, is the <hi>Variety</hi> of <hi>Readings</hi> which we find
among thoſe <hi>Copies,</hi> amounting to <hi>ſeveral
Thouſands:</hi> And if the <hi>Copies</hi> cannot, how
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98325:8"/>
can the <hi>Tranſlations</hi> be the <hi>Rule,</hi> ſo various (if
not differing) from the true Senſe of the
Copies in many things, and one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
Beſides, I would fain know of thoſe
of our preſent Age, who thus contend for
the Scriptures being the General Rule, <hi>&amp;c.
in Oppoſition to the Spirit,</hi> upon what foot
they receive them into this Place and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority:
Is it by <hi>Tradition,</hi> or <hi>Revelation?</hi>
I mean, the <hi>Internal Teſtimony of the Spirit;</hi>
or the <hi>External Award and Determination of
Men:</hi> If the former, they muſt unavoidably
come over to us; for then the <hi>Spirit</hi> will,
and muſt be both <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Judge:</hi> If the
Latter, I ask how are they aſſured that they
are not miſerably Abuſed by <hi>Careleſneſs</hi> or
<hi>Deſign;</hi> ſince we ſee, that uſing utmoſt Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
both <hi>Tranſlation, Tranſcription</hi> and <hi>Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
are ſubject to numerous Miſtakes, and
thoſe ſometimes very material, againſt which
the Scripture of it ſelf can be no Fence?</p>
            <p>But admit there were no Ground for any
ſuch Objection, I further demand of our
Adverſaries, if they are well aſſured of thoſe
Men that Firſt Collected, Embodied and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
them <hi>Authentick</hi> by a Publick <hi>Canon?</hi>
Which we read was in the <hi>Council of Laodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cea,</hi>
held 360 Years after Chriſt, though not
as they are now received: During which
time They had been toſſed and tumbled
through many Hands, and of many Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Opinions. Some were receiv'd,
and ſome rejected, and doubtleſs many <hi>Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands</hi>
of times tranſcribed; and it is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:98325:8"/>
that they were alſo abuſed. If they
miſs in their Judgment here, they are gone
till they come to us. I ſay, how do they
know that theſe Men rightly diſcerned true
from ſpurious? Either their Judgment was
infallible in the Matter, or it was not: If
it were, then there was ſuch a thing as <hi>Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility</hi>
ſince the Apoſtles Days, which is a
Contradiction to your ſelves. But be it ſo
that they were infallible; how came you to
be aſſured they were ſo? Not by <hi>Inſpiration;</hi>
for that is dangerous Doctrine with you:
Which way was it then? Not by <hi>Tradition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
Was it by the <hi>Scripture?</hi> That were to ſay
that the Scripture tells you that thoſe Men
that collected it for true, were Right in their
Judgment: But we are yet to find any ſuch
place, and if it were ſo, that would but
beg the Queſtion. I cannot ſee any other
Ground, beſides your very great <hi>Indulgence</hi>
to their Choice, which you call <hi>Popery,</hi> and
<hi>believing as the Church believes,</hi> in other Folks.
But if theſe Men were <hi>fallible,</hi> as your Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
makes them, and their own Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations
prove them, what then? Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
your Condition will be very uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
            <p>Now, ſure it is that ſome of the Scriptures
taken in by one Council for <hi>Canonical,</hi> were
rejected by Another as <hi>Apocryphal;</hi> and that
which was left out by the Former for <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criphal,</hi>
was taken in by the Latter for <hi>Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical.</hi>
Now viſible it is that they contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
each other, and as true that they
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:98325:9"/>
both erred, reſpecting the preſent Belief:
For your <hi>Canon</hi> and <hi>Catalogue</hi> vary from
theirs, and, let me ſay without Offence, from
any <hi>Catalogue</hi> you can produce. Behold the
<hi>Labyrinth</hi> of <hi>Incertainties</hi> you run your ſelves
into, who go from that <hi>Heavenly Gift is
your ſelves,</hi> by which the Holy Scriptures are
truly Diſcerned, Reliſhed and Diſtinguiſhed
from the Inventions and Abuſes of Men!</p>
            <p>8. Furthermore, If the Scriptures were
the <hi>Rule</hi> of Faith and Life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then becauſe
they cannot be the Rule in their <hi>Tranſlations,</hi>
ſuppoſing the ancient <hi>Copies</hi> were Exact, it
cannot be the Rule to <hi>far the Greateſt Part</hi>
of Mankind; indeed to none but <hi>Learned</hi>
Men: Which neither anſwers the Promiſe
relating to Goſpel-times, which is univerſal;
nor the Neceſſity of all Mankind for a <hi>Rule of
Faith and Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>9. That the Scriptures are not the Rule
of Faith and Life, is proved from thoſe vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminous
Diſcourſes of <hi>Caſes of Conſcience</hi>
that are extant among us: For had the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
been as ſufficient as the Nature of the
Rule of Faith and Life Requireth, there had
been no need of ſuch Tracts: Every Man
might have read his own Condition laid
down in Scripture without thoſe numerous
Supplements. Doth not your own Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
and Practice prove its Inſufficiency to
that End, at what time you both exhort to,
and go in ſecret to ſeek the Mind of the Lord
in this or that important Affair? Why do

I will give a ſhort Inſtance in Chriſt's
words about <hi>Regeneration:</hi> He taught (and
ſtrange it was, no doubt, to wiſe <hi>Nicodemus)
That unleſs a Man be born again, he cannot ſee
the Kingdom of God.</hi> This is as plain a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
as can be laid down, and may be
credited <hi>Hiſtorically:</hi> But what is that to the
<hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Experience</hi> of the New Birth?
That they are never like to be inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of there. Nor can that Scripture be my
Rule in that Heavenly Travel, reſpecting the
many and wonderful Trials and Exerciſes
that are to be met with in the way to It:
Neither can any other Writing whatever.
This only is the Office of that <hi>Spirit and Word
Immortal,</hi> by which we are begotten again.
What then is my Rule, to inform, order,
ſtrengthen and lead through the whole Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
but the <hi>Same Spirit?</hi> All Doctrinal
Scripture was experienced before written,
or they had not been true Witneſſes who
wrote it.</p>
            <p>Now that which was their Rule can only
guide us into the ſame Experiences; nor are
they to be rightly known before experienced:

to our days, are queſtionable by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;

The Myſteries of Regeneration are as <hi>Puzling</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But how elſe could you have known
thoſe Propheſies to be true, for that is not matter
of Witneſſing, but Fore-telling?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> That is an extraordinary Revelation,
not falling within the Ordinary Diſcoveries
that are abſolutely neceſſary to Man's Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
by which he ſhews his Power and
Faithfulneſs, that he is God, and can fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell,
and will bring to paſs: But therefore
muſt there be an Extraordinary Light or
Spirit, and not rather an Extraordinary Sight
and Senſe from <hi>One and the Same</hi> Light and
Spirit in them? Beſides, That which gives
me to <hi>Believe</hi> and <hi>Savour</hi> it to be from the
Spirit, and not by Impoſture, is my Rule for
believing it. Now that the Spirit ſo doth,
both <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> as before cited, aſſert
for me, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>The <hi>Same</hi> Spirit, that ſpake by

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But this Light you ſpeak of could not
tell you which way Sin came into the World:
That there was an <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> that they
fell after that manner, and that Sin ſo entered
the World: That Chriſt was born of a Virgin,
ſuffered Death and roſe again: That you ought
not to Swear in any caſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If the Scriptures
had not told you ſo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> That is boldly ſaid: But conſider
well: <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſays the vulgar Opinion, had
that Account of the <hi>Creation,</hi> above Two
Thouſand Years after it, by <hi>Revelation,</hi> which
we find in <hi>Geneſis.</hi> Now that there could
be no Revelation without this Divine Light
or Spirit, which is the Life of the Eternal, Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating
Word, muſt needs be granted: <hi>For,</hi> ſaith
the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cor. 2. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

is <hi>Light:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 5. 13.</note> And that the Spirit and Light are
One, tho' Two Names, has been ſufficiently
evidenced already. If then it was <hi>This Light</hi>
of the Eternal Word, that delivered thoſe
paſt things to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and gave that Proſpect
of future things to the Prophets, as no doubt
it was, if the Scripture be Credible, then to
ſay, the Light or Spirit could not do it, is
<hi>Blaſphemous</hi> as well as abſurd. Again To
argue, becauſe the Light does not Reveal
every Circumſtance of Hiſtory to each In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual
that hath already an Account there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:98325:18"/>
of therefore it could not, is Unreaſonable.
Were the Hiſtory of the Tranſactions of
Chriſt and his Followers wanting, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Moſes</hi> was that of <hi>Adam</hi> and his Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and that the Lord ſaw it needful to
acquaint Mankind therewith, no doubt but
the Light and Spirit which revealed the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the Creation, above Two Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Years after, to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and fore-told ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Hundred Years many of thoſe Tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Chriſt by the Prophets, would alſo
have ſupplied that Want: But inaſmuch as
an Account is extant, and therefore not need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that Objection is vain.</p>
            <p>Again it does not follow, becauſe every
Man has a Meaſure of Light to Inform and
Rule him, that therefore he muſt needs
know all which that Light knows, or is
able to Reveal to him. I return that Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
thus upon our Adverſaries: They ſay
they have the Spirit of God; <hi>Then they know
all that the Spirit of God knows, or can reveal
to them:</hi> If the latter be abſurd, then the
former. Again ſay they, <hi>The Light within
did not reveal Chriſt to the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>and that
Chriſt ſhould be born of a Virgin,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>therefore
Inſufficient:</hi> I return upon them thus; The
Spirit of God, given to the Children of <hi>Iſrael,
Neh.</hi> 9. 20. did not acquaint them that Chriſt
ſhould be <hi>born of a Virgin,</hi> nor much more of
his <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Bodily Tranſactions;</hi> therefore the
Spirit of God was Inſufficient. The like may
be concluded againſt the Spirit in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets:
For 'tis manifeſt from 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10, 11.

               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:98325:20"/>
that the Spirit had not revealed to all the
Prophets the Time of Chriſt's Appearance
and Sufferings: Was the Spirit therefore an
<hi>Inſufficient</hi> Rule to them? But that which falls
heavieſt upon our Oppoſers is this, That the
Scriptures by their own Argument, are a
moſt <hi>Inperfect Account</hi> themſelves of what was
done, not relating the hundredth part of
things; therefore as Inſufficient in not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
<hi>what is behind,</hi> as they would weakly
render the Light or Spirit in not revealing
to every Individual thoſe things which are
already paſt: Nay, they may as well infer
Inſufficiency to the Spirit, or the Light
within, <hi>in that it does not now ſhew all that
ſhall be to the End of the World,</hi> which in their
proper Seaſons there will be a Neceſſity to
know, as to reflect Inſufficiency upon it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
becauſe it did not fore-tell things that are
now paſt unto former Ages, or <hi>needleſly</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal
them over again to us in this Age.
Neither is <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> or can it be, the Rule of
that Faith and Life we ſpeak of, which are
ſo abſolutely neceſſary to Salvation; which
is the Faith that God and not Hiſtory gives,
and that works not by Hiſtory, but by <hi>Love,</hi>
and overcomes the World; by which Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
of <hi>Hiſtorical</hi> Believers are overcome, and
wallow in the Spirit and Practice of: And
the Rule muſt be anſwerable to the Nature
and Workings of the Faith: The ſame in
Point of Practice, which is Duty Done.

Actions, yet it does not follow that it is the

            <p>And though this may ſeem ſtrange to

He is no true Judge of Controverſie.
Indeed it is abſurd, and a Contradiction in

And if not a certain one, then none

            <p>I Would not be miſunderſtood in what I
have writ of the Excellency and Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of the Holy Spirit of God, as the firſt,
chief and general Rule of Life and Practice,
and as the infallible, and therefore the beſt
Judge of Controverſy among <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> as
if I thereby intended to leſſen or undervalue
the divine Authority, or Service, of the
bleſſed Scriptures of Truth, ſince we moſt
heartily believe them to have been given
forth from the ſame Holy Spirit, and are a
Declaration of the Mind and Will of God;
and, as ſuch, are obliging upon all that
have, and can have them, both in reference
to Faith and Practice: And we utterly
diſclaim and renounce all Doctrines and
Practices repugnant to them.</p>
            <p>But as the holy Spirit gave them forth
through Holy Men, ſo without the Help of
the Holy Spirit, they cannot be truly and
ſpiritually underſtood, by thoſe that read
them, for their Edification and Comfort;
for that which writ them can beſt apply
them: Which is the Reaſon of that Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
we give to the Spirit of God, and of
our preſſing People to take diligent Heed to
the Manifeſtation of it, that they may read,
pray, praiſe, preach and live in the Spirit, to
God's Glory and their eternal Comfort.</p>
