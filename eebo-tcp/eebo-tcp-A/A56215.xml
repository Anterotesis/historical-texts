            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE authority of Chriſtian Magiſtrates under the Goſpel having of late years been moſt audaciouſly oppugned both in Preſs and Pulpit, in ſundry particulars, eſpecially in points of <hi>Church-Government, Church Reformation,</hi> and this principal branch thereof; <hi>the reſtraint and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of obſtinate ſeducing Idolaters, Hereticks, falſe Teachers, Schiſmaticks, and Blaſphemers, by civil ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and corporal puniſhments;</hi> I thought it not only ſeaſonable, but in ſome ſort neceſſary, to debate this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion in a plain and plenary manner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whether Chriſtian Kings, States and Magiſtrates under the Goſpel, may and ought, by the Word of God, to restrain by Civil Sanctions all Idolatries, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies, Errours, Schiſms, Blasphemies, and to Mulct with corporall, pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niary, and in ſome caſes, with banishment and capital punishments, ſuch ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate ſeducing Idolaters, Apoſtaces, Hereticks, falſe Teachers, Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks and Blaſphemers, who diſturbe the Peace of Church, State, and draw down judgements upon both; when Admonitions, Exhortations, and diſputes will not reclaim them?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhal maintain the Affirmative, that <hi>they may, nay ought to do it.</hi> To avoyd miſtakes and ſtate the queſtion aright; I ſhal firſt of all lay down theſe concluſions as indubitable.</p>
            <p>1. That there are ſuch ſins as Idolatry, Apoſtacy, Hereſie, damnable Errors, obſtinate Schiſms and Blaſphemies in Chriſtian Kingdomes, States, Churches, and perſons guilty of them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:64093:3"/>2. That thoſe who are guilty of them, are, or may be certainly known, diſcovered to and by Chriſtian Princes and Magiſtrates.</p>
            <p>3. That theſe ſins draw down Gods Judgments, not only on the perſons who are guilty of them, but likewiſe on the Chriſtian Rulers, States, and places which permit, tolerate, or not ſeverely puniſh and ſuppreſſe them.</p>
            <p>4. That it is the duty of Chriſtian Princes, States, Magiſtrates, to uſe all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible diligence and lawful means to keep their Kingdomes, States, People, from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing infected with all, or any of theſe dangerous wrath-provoking ſins, yea, a grand ſin and neglect in them, not to do it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I ſhal propound and agree what is not in controverſie, as.</p>
            <p>1. That the preaching of the Word, Chriſtian Exhortations, Reprehentions, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, and Diſputes, are the moſt proper and effectual means to convert, reform Idolaters, Apoſtates, Hereticks, Falſe Teachers, Schiſmaticks, and Blaſphemers.</p>
            <p>2. That ſuch as theſe are firſt of all to be gently admoniſhed, inſtructed, confuted, and if poſſible, reformed by the Word, or other ſpiritual and gentle means, before the civil Magiſtate proceed to corporal or capital puniſhments.</p>
            <p>3. That the preſent queſtion is only of Idolaters, Apoſtates, Hereticks, Falſe Teachers, obſtinate Schiſmaticks, and Blaſphemers, not meer tender conſciencis in matters of Church Diſcipline and the like; neither yet are all theſe always to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded againſt with the ſelf-ſame rigour and ſeverity; but as their obſtinacy, Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, Apoſtacies, Hereſies, Errors, Schiſms, Blaſphemies, are more or leſſe heinous and pernitious, ſo the proceedings againſt them ought to be more milde or ſevere.</p>
            <p>Theſe things premiſed, I ſhal now proceed to ſome Arguments to make good my Aſſertion: The firſt ſhal be this.</p>
            <p>That which godly Kings and Magiſtrates in the Old Teſtament, under the Law,<note place="margin">Argum. 1.</note> were enjoyned to do by Gods own expreſs command, and did accordingly execute with Gods ſpecial approbation: Chriſtian Kings and Magiſtrates under the Goſpel, may and ought to do and execute, by virtue of the ſelf-ſame commands.</p>
            <p>But godly Kings and Magiſtrates in the Old Teſtament, under the Law, were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned by Gods own expreſs command, to reſtrain all Idolatry, Apoſtacy, Hereſie, Errors, Schiſms, Blaſphemies; yea to puniſh with corporal, and in ſome caſes with capital Puniſhments, ſuch obſtinate ſeducing Idolaters, Apoſtates, Hereticks, Falſe Teachers, Schiſmaticks, and Blaſphemers, who diſturbed the Peace of Church, State, and drew down Gods Judgments upon either, and did accordingly execute the ſame command with Gods ſpecial approbation, when admonitions, exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Diſputes would not reclaim them.</p>
            <p>Therefore Chriſtian Magiſtrates under the Goſpel may and ought to do the like.</p>
            <p>The Major Propoſition I ſhal make good by theſe undenyable reaſons.</p>
            <p>Firſt, becauſe <note n="*" place="margin">See the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, Sect. 19. and <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vins Inſtit.</hi> l. 4. c. 20.</note> God hath ordained and continued Kings and Magiſtrates under the New Teſtament as wel as under the Old, and enjoyned obedience to them; ROM. 13. 1. to 6. 1 TIM. 2. 1, 2, 3. TIT. 3. 1. 1 PET. 2. 13, 14. c. 4. 15. which none but profeſſed Anabaptiſts do deny.</p>
            <p>Secondly, becauſe Chriſtian Kings and Magiſtrates under the Goſpel, have the ſelf-ſame authority as godly Kings and Magiſtrates had under the Law; even as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, Maſters, Husbands (naturall Magiſtrates) have the ſelf-ſame authority over their Children, Servants, Wives, under the Goſpel, as they had under the Law; ROM.

COL. 3. 18. to 25. 1 TIM. 6. 1, 2. 1 PET. 3. 11. 12. 13. c. 2. 18. there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no one text in the New Teſtament which reſtrains either Kings or Magiſtrates power given them by God in the Old.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, becauſe the ends and uſes for which Magiſtrates were inſtituted are the <note n="*" place="margin">See Zuing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Explan.

            <p>Fourthly, becauſe the precepts given to Magiſtrates under the Law, for puniſhing Idolaters, Apoſtates, Falſe Prophets, Hereticks, and Blaſphemers, are not Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial or Judicial, but moral and perpetual: and ſo of equal obligation under the Law and Goſpel, as wel as the Decalogue and Moral Law of God.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, becauſe godly Kings and Chriſtian Magiſtrates ought to be as zealous for God and his truth (if not more zealous) under the Goſpel, as they were under the Law; REV. 3. 19. c. 2. 14, 15, 16. 20. 23. compared with NUM <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Firſt, for Idolatry, Idolaters, Apoſtates, Falſe Prophets, and Seducers of men from the true God and Religion, to Idols and Idolatry, we have theſe expreſſe precepts, warranting, if not commanding, the civil Magiſtrate to inflict corporal and capital puniſhments on them.</p>

            <p>Firſt, that not only ſuch ſtranger Idolaters, who conſtantly worſhipped Idols, and never adored the true God were to be put to death by the Iſraelites; but even ſuch of the Iſraelites themſelves, and of the ſojourners among them who turned Idolaters and ſacrificed unto Molech (to whom they offered their children) were to be <hi>ſurely put to death, and ſtoned with ſtones by the people without m r y;</hi> being firſt convicted and condemned by the Magiſtrate. Secondly, that the Magiſtrates and peoples hiding of their eyes and ſparing ſuch as theſe, contrary to this precept, was a grievous ſin. Thirdly, that where the Magiſtrates and people winked at ſuch an Idolater, and hid their eyes from him, God himſelf, in their default, would ſet his face againſt him, and cut him off from among his people; and not only ſo, but would ſet his face againſt his family; and cut off all them that went a whoring af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, from among his people: whereas if the Magiſtrate had puniſhed him, his family had not been thus cut of by God. Fourthly, that it is not ſufficient to leave Idolaters, Hereticks, and Blaſphemers to Gods own vengeance and execution, who wil certainly cut them and their families off, if they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> repent not; but themſelves muſt

               <hi>you away from the Lord your God, which brought you out of the Land of Egypt, and redeemed you out of the houſe of bondage, to thruſt thee out of the way which the Lord thy God commanded thee to walk in) ſo ſhalt thou put the evil away from the midſt of thee. If thy brother, the ſon of thy mother<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or thy ſon; or thy daughter, or the wife of thy boſome, or thy friend which is as thine own ſoul, entice thee ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> ſaying, <hi>let us go and ſerve other gods (which thou hast not known, thou nor thy fathers), namely of the gods of the people, which are round about you,</hi> or <hi>nigh unto thee, or far off from thee, from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth: Thou ſhalt not conſent unto him, nor hearken unto him, neither ſhal thine eye pity him, neither ſhalt thou ſpare, neither ſhalt thou conceal him: But</hi> thou ſhalt ſurely kil him, thine hand ſhal be firſt upon him to put him to death, and<note place="margin">Note.</note> afterwards the hands of all the people; <hi>And thou ſhalt ſtone him with ſtones that he dye,</hi> becauſe he hath ſought to thruſt thee away from the Lord thy God, which brought thee out of the Land of Egypt, out of the houſe of bondage: <hi>And all Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael ſhal hear, and fear, and ſhal do no more any ſuch wickedneſſe as this is among you. If thou ſhalt hear ſay in one of thy Cities, which the Lord thy God hath given thee to dwel there, ſaying, Certain men, the children of Belial, are gone out from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, and have withdrawn the Inhabitants of their City, ſaying, Let us go and ſerve other gods (which we have not known); Then shalt thou inquire and make ſearch and ask diligently: And behold if it be truth, and the thing certain, that ſuch abomination is wrought amongst you:</hi> Thou ſhalt ſurely ſmite the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of that City with the edge of the ſword, deſtroying it utterly and all that<note place="margin">Note.</note> is therein, and the cattle thereof with the edge of the ſword: <hi>And thou ſhalt gather all the ſpoil of it into the midſt of the ſtreet thereof, and ſhalt burn with fire the City and all the ſpoil thereof, every whit, for the Lord thy God; and it ſhal bee an heap for ever, it ſhal not be built again: And there ſhal cleave nought of the curſed thing to thine hand, that the Lord may turn from the fierceneſſe of his anger and ſhew thee mercy, and have compaſſion upon thee, and multiply thee, as he hath ſworn unto thy fathers: When thou ſhalt hearken to the vo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

to keep all his Commandments, which I command thee this day, to do that which is right in the eyes of the Lord thy God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which is thus ſeconded <hi>Deut. 17. 2. to 8. If there be found among you within any of thy gates, which the Lord thy God giveth thee, man or woman that hath wrought wickedneſſe in the ſight of the Lord thy God, in tranſgreſſing his Covenant, and hath gone and ſerved other gods, and worſhipped them, either the Sun, or the Moon, or any of the hoſt of heaven, which I have not commanded; And it be told thee, and thou haſt heard of it, and enquired diligently, and behold it be true, and the thing certain, that ſuch abomination is wrought in Iſrael: Then ſhalt thou bring forth that man, or that woman (which have committed that wicked thing) unto thy gates; even that man or that woman, and ſhalt</hi> ſtone them with ſtones til they dye. <hi>At the mouth of two witneſſes, ſhal <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e</hi> that is worthy of death be<note place="margin">Note.</note> put to death; <hi>but at the mouth of one witneſſe he ſhal not be put to death: The hands of the witneſſes ſhal be firſt upon him</hi> to put him to death, <hi>and afterwards the hands of all the people; ſo thou ſhalt put the evil away from among you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From which two Texts I ſhal deduce theſe undeniable Concluſions.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That falſe Prophets and Dreamers of dreams may ariſe among Gods own people, and do ſigns, wonders, and predict things which may come to paſs: which is more, I ſuppoſe, then any of our pretended New-Lights, Dreamers, or falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets now can do.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That the end of ſuch Dreamers and falſe Prophets, is but to draw peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to go after other gods which they have not formerly known, and to ſerve them, or to worſhip the true God in an undue newfangled manner.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That God ſuffers ſuch falſe Prophets and New ſeducing Lights to ariſe among his people, of purpoſe to prove them; to know whether they love the Lord their God with all their heart and with all their ſoul.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That Gods people muſt not hearken to ſuch falſe Prophets, Dreamers, and New-Lights, though they do ſigns and wonders, but walk after the Lord their God, and fear him, and keep his Commandments, and obey his voyce, and ſerve and cleave unto him; and that thoſe that follow ſuch falſe Prophets and Dreamers, do neither truly love, fear, ſerve, obey, nor cleave to God.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, That ſuch falſe Prophets and Dreamers were by Gods expreſs Command<note place="margin">Note.</note> to be PUT TO DEATH, by the Magiſtrate and people, though they actually ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced none from God; <hi>even becauſe they had ſpoken revolt against the Lord their God, to turn them away from him, to thruſt them out of the way; which the Lord their God commanded them to walk in.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixthly, That the putting of ſuch to death, is ſo far from being an evil, or ſin of perſecution; that it is the only way to <hi>put away the evill</hi> of Idolatry, Falſe-Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, ſin, plague, and puniſhment, <hi>from the midſt of them,</hi> ver. 5.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, that if not onely ſuch falſe Prophets and dreamers; but even any mans own natural brother, ſon, daughter, wife, nigheſt boſome and moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deared friend, which is as his own ſoul, ſhould entice him ſecretly to go and ſerve other gods (or the true God in a new and falſe manner) which he and his fathers had not known; be it what falſ god ſoever, he muſt neither conſent nor hearken to them, neither ſhal his eye pity them, neither ſhal he ſpare, nor conceal them; but<note place="margin">Note.</note> he SHAL SURELY KIL THEM (without mercy) and his own hand ſhal be firſt
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64093:5"/>
upon them to put them to death; and afterwards the hands of all the people, and they ſhal ſtone them with ſtones that they dye; not becauſe they actually ſeduced him or others; but becauſe they ſought to thruſt him away from the Lord his God: If then the neareſt and deareſt of all others to us muſt be put to death without mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, in ſuch a caſe, then much more others who are not ſo neerly related to us. Gods glory and our zeal to preſerve his ſincere Worſhip, muſt admit of no reſpect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, no toleration, connivance or compaſſion in ſuch a caſe as this.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, That exemplary capital puniſhments, upon private or open enticers to Idolatry and Falſe-Worſhip, is a ſpecial means appointed by God to preſerve and convert others from Idolatry, and Apoſtacy, Verſe 11. <q>And all Iſrael ſhal hear and fear and do no more any ſuch wickedneſs as this is among you:</q> The Sword of Juſtice wil by Gods own Inſtitution ſuppreſs, prevent, yea reform Idolatry, Apoſtacy, Falſe-Worſhip, and Hereſie, as wel as the Word, the Sword of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; and prevails herein many times when the Word it ſelf is ineffectual.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, <note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>Lucas Tudenſis</hi> adv. <hi>Albigenſes</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 22.</note> That Magiſtrates are to make diligent ſearch and inquiry after Falſe-Teachers, Apoſtates, Seducers of men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to ſerve new gods, embrace new religions; and if a whole City be thus ſeduced, and ſuch abomination certainly wrought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them; they <q>muſt ſurely ſmite the Inhabitants of that City (eſpecially of obſtinate and impenitent) with the edge of the ſword, deſtroying it utterly, and all that is therein, and the cattel thereof, and burn all the ſpoil and City, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry parcel thereof with fire, and make it an heap for ever.</q> By which it is apparent that not only private Idolaters, Apoſtates, Hereticks, but even whole Cities, Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and Congregations of them are ſo far from being tolerated, that they ought to be deſtroyed utterly if they continue obſtinate.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, That the tolerating of Idolaters, Apoſtates, and Hereticks is a means to provoke God to pour out the fierceneſs of his anger againſt his own people; but the utter exterpation of them without mercy, is a ſpecial means (of divine inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) to cau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e the Lord <q>to turn from the fierceneſſe of his anger, to ſhew them mercy and compaſſion; and multiply them as he hath promiſed:</q> And is ſo far from being againſt the Word of God and diſpleaſing to him, <q>that it is a keeping of what he commands, a doing of that which is right in his eyes:</q> Certainly it was ſo under the Old Teſtament, I doubt not but it is and wil be the like under the New, which no ways contradicts nor revokes this text, or the ſevere proceedings enjoyned by the Old.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18. 18. to 22. <hi>I wil raiſe them up a Prophet from among their</hi>
               <note place="margin">3.</note> 
               <hi>brethren like unto thee, and I wil put my words into his mouth, and he ſhal speak unto them all that I ſhal commond him &amp;c. But the Prophet which ſhal preſume to ſpeak a word in my name, which I have not commanded him to speak; or that ſhal ſpeak in the name of other gods, even that Prophet SHAL DYE: he hath spoken preſumptuouſly, thou shalt not be affraid of him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From whence I infer: Firſt, that falſe Prophets who preſume to preach any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Errors, or Hereſies contrary to the Word of God, to draw men unto Error, Hereſie, or Falſe-Worſhip, are by the expreſs Command of God to be put to death by the civil Magiſtrate, as wel as ſuch prophets who ſpeak in the name of other gods: For this phraſe SHAL DYE, here, is not intended of a NATURAL DEATH <note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 9. 27.</note> COMMON TO ALL MEN; for then it were no ſpecial Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64093:5"/>
threatned unto, and to be inflicted upon ſuch; but a PENAL DEATH judicially inflicted by men, as is clear by comparing it with <hi>Deut,</hi> 13. 5. c. 17. 5. <hi>Zech.</hi> 13. 3. &amp; <hi>Ier.</hi> 26. 8. 11. 16. 23. <hi>Exod.</hi> 21. 12. 14. <hi>Num.</hi> 35. 30. Secondly, this precept relates principally to falſe Teachers, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets under the Goſpel, and is not confined only to the times of the Law, ſince<note place="margin">Note.</note> the next Verſes preceding, to which it is ſubjoyned, relate only to Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his <hi>Propheſying</hi> in the Fleſh, as is evident by comparing them with <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 45. <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 22. &amp; 7. 37. and becauſe it is ſeconded by <hi>Zech.</hi> 3. 2, 3 &amp;c. which relates only to the times of the Goſpel (as I ſhal prove anon) under which Falſe Prophets are to be put to death as wel as under the Law. Theſe three<note place="margin">Examples.</note> Precepts we find ſeconded with exemplary Executions approved and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by God himſelf.</p>
            <p>The firſt Example, is that we read of <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. <hi>viz.</hi> That when the Iſraelites<note place="margin">1.</note> had committed <hi>Idolatry in worshipping the golden calf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Verſ. 26, 27<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 28<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 29. <hi>Moſes ſtood in the Camp and ſaid, who is on the Lords ſide? let him come unto mee; and all the ſons of Levy gathered unto him. And he ſaid unto them, thus ſaith the Lord God of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>put every man his ſword by his ſide,</hi> and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the Camp, and ſlay every man his brother, and every man his companion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and every man his neighbor; <hi>And the children of Levy did according to the word of</hi> Moſes, <hi>and</hi> there fel of the people that day about three thouſand men: <hi>For</hi> Moſes <hi>had ſaid, conſecrate your ſelves to day to the Lord: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man upon his ſon, and every man upon his brother, that he may beſtow upon you a bleſſing this day:</hi> Whence obſerve theſe two Concluſions: Firſt, that three thouſand Idolatrous Iſraelites for worſhipping the golden calf, were upon Gods ſpecial command ſlain by the direction of <hi>Moſes</hi> the chief temporal Magiſtrate, in one day, even by the ſons of <hi>Levi</hi> for want of other Executioners, and that they ſpared neither ſon, nor brother, nor neighbor guilty of this ſin. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly that this ſevere execution of Juſtice upon theſe Offendors, was ſo pleaſing unto <hi>God,</hi> that it pacified his wrath, and procured a bleſſing upon the Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and reſidue of the people, as this Chapter, and <hi>Deut.</hi> 33. 8, 9. 10. infallibly evidences.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Example is regiſtred in <hi>Numb.</hi> 25. 1. to 15. where we find, <hi>That</hi>
               <note place="margin">2.</note> 
               <hi>the Daughters of Moab called the people of Iſrael unto the ſacrifices of their gods and that the people did eat and bowed down to their god; And</hi> Iſrael <hi>ioyned himſelf unto</hi> Baal Peo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>r, <hi>and the anger of the Lord was kindled againſt</hi> Iſrael; <hi>and the Lord ſaid unto</hi> Moſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Take all the heads of the people and hang them up before the Lord againſt the Sun; <hi>that the fierce anger of the Lord may be turned away from</hi> Iſrael: <hi>And</hi> Moſes <hi>ſaid unto the Iudges of</hi> Iſrael, ſlay ye every one his men that were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64093:6"/>
his tent,</hi> and thruſt both of them through, the man of Iſrael and the woman through the belly (for Peors ſake Verſe 18.) <hi>So the plague was ſtayed from the children of Iſrael: And thoſe that dyed of the plague were about twenty four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand; And the Lord ſpake unto</hi> Moſes <hi>ſaying,</hi> Phineas <hi>the ſon of</hi> Eleazar, <hi>the ſon of</hi> Aaron <hi>the Prieſt, hath turned away my wrath from the children of Iſrael (when he was zealous for my ſake among them) that I conſumed not the children of Iſrael in my jealouſie; wherefore, behold I give unto him my Covenant of peace, and he ſhal have it, and his ſeed after him, even the Covenant of an everlaſting Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, becauſe he was zealous for his God, and made an attonement for the children of Iſrael:</hi> The firſt part of this hiſtory is thus amplified, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 3. <hi>Your eyes have ſeen what the Lord did becauſe of Baal Peor; for all the men that followed Baal-Peor, the Lord thy God hath deſtroyed them from among you:</hi> to wit by the plague, and the <hi>Sword of Iuſtice</hi> too in the Magiſtrates hand.</p>
            <p>From which memorable hiſtory there are theſe conſiderable obſervations na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally deduceable. Firſt, that Apoſtates from Gods true Worſhip to Idolatry and falſe Worſhip, are to be executed, ſlain, and put to death by the Judges and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Magiſtrate, by Gods own ſpecial Command. Secondly, that the Apoſtacy of Gods own people to Idolatry, and the Magiſtrates connivance thereat, is an immediate cauſe of provoking Gods wrath, and bringing down publick plagues and other judgements upon that whole Nation or Kingdom wherein they are not puniſhed. Thirdly, that Gods own immediate puniſhing and cutting off Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters with a plague, is no argument nor excuſe at all for the temporal Magiſtrates ſparing or not puniſhing ſuch with death (whoſe execution is here ſaid to bee &amp; ſtiled Gods own act, ſince they are but his Miniſters herein) but rather an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to excite them to the more ſpeedy exemplary puniſhing of them even with death it ſelf: which anſwers and refels one grand objection againſt puniſhing Hereticks, and Blaſphemers with death, becauſe God himſelf wil puniſh them if they repent not, and we muſt wholy leave them to his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Fourthly, that the beſt and ſpeedyeſt courſe to remove Gods judgements brought upon a Nation for Idolatry, Apoſtacy, Hereſie, or Blaſphemy, is for the temporal Magiſtrates to execute ſpeedy and exemplary capital puniſhments on thoſe who are notoriouſly guilty of them; and that faſting and prayer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch exemplary executions upon the moſt eminent Malefactors in this kind, wil never pacify Gods wrath, nor remove his judgements inflicted for theſe ſins. Fifthly, that the executing of capital puniſhments upon ſuch, is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>true zeal to GOD:</hi> And therefore it ſeems ſtrange to me, that thoſe in this age, who pretend themſelvs the only Saints, Zealots, faithful ones, paramount all others by head and ſhouldiers in grace and piety, ſhould be ſo voyd of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian zeal for God, as to plead, preach, write, and print againſt the corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and capital Puniſhment or Apoſtates, Idolaters, Hereticks, and Blaſphemers by temporal Magiſtrates, and for a free Toleration of all Sects, Hereſies, and Religions whatſoever, under the pretence of Liber<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>y of Conſcience: Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this extream want of holy zeal for God againſt Apoſtates<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Idolaters, Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks; Blaſphemers, and pleading for their impunity, at leaſt with capital Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, argues them to be no real Saints, becauſe they have no true love to, nor zeal for God, which would make them as forward to thruſt their Javelins, or
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64093:6"/>
the ſword of Juſtice through the Bowels of ſuch tranſcendent offendors, as Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas was to thruſt his Javelin through Zimri and Cozbi, without any queſtion or diſpute. Sixthly, that the exemplary capital puniſhing of ſuch, is ſo far from being a perſecution of the Saints, or againſt the Clemency of God under the Law or Goſpel, that it is a moſt acceptable ſervice to God, and procures a ſpecial Bleſſing upon the perſons and poſterities of thoſe who are moſt zealous and active in this ſervice, as appears by this example of Phineas, regiſtred for his eternal honor and our future imitation and encouragement in this kind.</p>
            <p>The third Example is JOSH. 22. 10. to 34. Where we read, <hi>that when the Children</hi>
               <note place="margin">3.</note> 
               <hi>of Ruben, Gad, and the half Tribe of Manaſſeh had but built an Altar at the ſide of Iordan, the children of Iſrael no ſooner heard thereof, but the whole Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the children of Iſrael gathered themſelves together at Shiloh, to go up to war againſt them, to deſtroy them, and the Cities wherein they dwelt, as guilty of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, Apostacy, and Falſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Worſhip; apprehending the very building of this Altar to be a treſpaſs committed againſt the God of Iſrael, to turn them away from following the Lord, that they might rebel againſt him, and that it would prove like the ſin of Peor, and bring Gods wrath on the whole Congregation of Iſrael and not on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves alone: when as in truth they built it only for a memor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

            </p>
            <p>From which hiſtory I collect: Firſt, that the whole Congregation of Iſrael when they were moſt ſincere and beſt affected towards God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> deemed this ſuppoſed guilt of Apoſtacy, Idolatry, and Schiſm in theſe two Tribes and an half, by building this New Altar, a juſt ground of making a publick war againſt them, to deſtroy both them and their Country for this crime (though they were their dear brethren, who aſſiſted them to conquer the Land of Canaan) by vertue of Gods Command fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited DEUT. 13. 11. to 17. Secondly, that the Apoſtacy, Idolatry, and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Schiſm of a few, wil draw down Gods Judgements upon a whole Nation and Kingdom, in caſe they tolerate or connive at them, and do not ſpeedily cut them off by the ſword of Juſtice. Thirdly, that in ſuch a caſe, there is no way to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Gods wrath on all, but to cut off the Malefactors by ſpeedy execution of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral puniſhments and death upon them.</p>
            <p>The fourth Example is recorded in the 1 KING. 18. 40. &amp;c. 19. 1, 2. Where<note place="margin">4.</note>

Secondly, that the execution of thoſe Idolatrous falſe Prophets, was ſo neceſſary, that rather then they ſhould want capital puniſhment the Prophet Elijah himſelf would be their executioner. His zeal then ſhould ſhame our lukewarmneſſe now.</p>

            <p>Firſt, that this godly King and all his people bound themſelves by a ſolemn Oath and Covenant (much like to ours) TO PUT ALL Idolaters, Apoſtates, Hereticks, and Blaſphemers, and whoſoever would not ſeek the Lord (of what quality or ſort ſoever) TO DEATH.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that this Oath and Covenant was ſo wel pleaſing to God and agreeable to his Law, that whereas immediately before their entring into it, <hi>here was no peace to him that went out, nor to him that came in, but great vexations were upon all the Inhabitants of the Countries, and Nation was deſtroyed of Nation, and City of

            <p>Secondly, That they had power to puniſh Blaſphemy and Blaſphemers of God even with death, by an expreſs Commiſſion from God himſelf, is as clear as the Noonday Sun, by theſe enſuing Texts: LEVIT. 24. 10. to 17. and <hi>the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

A moſt punctuall Law, extending to all blaſphemers of God and his name, be they Natives or For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigners, of what ſex or quality ſoever; coupled in the next Verſe with this penal Statute, Ver. 17. AND HE THAT KILLETH ANY MAN SHAL BE PVT TO DEATH: ſo that thoſe who at this day queſtion or deny the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates power to put Blaſphemers (or groſs Hereticks who deny Chriſts Divinity &amp;c. whoſe very aſſentions are direct blaſphemies) to death: may upon the ſelf-ſame grounds, and with equal reaſon deny the Magiſtrates power to put Murtherers to death: the one Law being as moral, as perpetual, as the other: Yea the equity of that other Law, EXOD. 21. 17. and LEVIT. 20. 9. <hi>Every one that curſeth his father and mother ſhal S<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RELY BE P<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>T TO DEATH<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his blood ſhal be upon him;</hi> muſt hold more ſtrongly of him that ſhal curſe and blaſpheme his heavenly, then his earthy Father; in as much as the one is infinitly greater, and more to be reverenced, feared, honored, obeyed then the other. This Law was ſo obligatory and Authentick among the Iſraelites even in the reign of King Ahab, and Jezebel; that the Nobles and Elders upon Jezebels Letter, and the witneſſes teſtimony ſuborned by her; <hi>condemned Naboth, for that he did blalpheme God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereupon they carried him forth out of the City,</hi> and STONED HIM WITH STONES THAT HE DYED, 1 KING. 21. 5. to 15. Yea the wicked Jews, Elders, and High-prieſts who put our Savior to death, were ſo zealous in puniſhing whatever they reputed blaſphemy, by coulor of this precept, that JOH. 10. 31, 32, 33. The Jews TOOK UP STONES TO STONE CHRIST HIM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SELF for BLASPHEMY (which they pretended he had ſpoken) AND FOR THAT HE BEING MAN MADE HIMSELF GOD; And at his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignment before his paſſion MAT. 26. 64, 65, 66.

HE IS G<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ILTY OF DEATH.</hi> An unanſwerable proof, that Blaſphemy even in our Saviors time, was a capital crime puniſhable with death among the Jews: and all by vertue of this forecited expreſſe Law of God. Thoſe then muſt be more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt then Ahab or Jezebel, more impious and leſſe zealous then the wicked Jews, High Prieſts, or Elders who put Chriſt to death, that dare plead for the exemption of Blaſphemers of God, or the Trinity from death and capital puniſhments, when God himſelf hath thus poſitively commanded, <hi>That they ſhal ſurely and certainly be out to death.</hi>

            <p>My ſecond Argument is this.</p>
            <p>Godly Kings and Magiſtrates under the Law and Old Teſtament had power to<note place="margin">Argum. 2.</note> puniſh Sabbath-breakers, Sorcerers, Witches, Murtherers, Adulterers, Wicked doers, and diſobeyers of the Law of God, with temporal and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital puniſhments.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ergo.</hi> Chriſtian Magiſtrates and Princes now have power under the Goſpel to puniſh Idolaters, Apoſtates, Hereticks, Falſe Teachers, obſtinate Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks and Blaſphemers with corporal and capital puniſhments.</p>
            <p>The ſequel is firm, becauſe the ſame reaſon holds a like in all, and becauſe it is an argument a <hi>Minori ad Maju;</hi> ſins againſt the firſt ſecond third fourth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (as Divines generally accord) being more hainous then ſins againſt the ſecond Table, becauſe more immediate againſt the very nature, eſſence, and name of God himſelf; and ſpiritual Sorcerers, Witches, Murtherers, Adulterers (ſuch as all Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Hereticks, Apoſtates, Falſe Teachers, obſtinate Schiſmaticks and Blaſphemers are) being worſe and more dangerous then corporal, becauſe they hurt and deſtroy mens ſouls, and becauſe the forecited and ſubſequent texts warrant their puniſhing of theſe with death, as wel as thoſe.</p>
            <p>The antecedent I ſhall ratifie by theſe Authorities; That Sabbath-breakers WERE TO BE PUNISHED by the Civil Magiſtrate WITH DEATH, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by EXOD. 31. 14, 15. NUM. 15. 32. to 37. That Sorcerers and Witches were to be put to death and not ſuffred to live, is apparant by LEV. 20. 27. DEUT. 18. 10, 11. 1 SAM. 28. 9. That adulterous and inceſtuous perſons were to be put to death by Gods command by the Magiſtrate, is clear by GEN. 26. 11. c. 38. 24. 25. LEVIT. 8. 6. to 30. c. 20. 10. to 19. c. 21. 9.

4, 5. That Murderers were to be put to death without mercy, is clearly reſolved in direct terms, GEN. 9. 5, 6. EXOD. 21. 12, 13, 14. LEVIT. 24. 17. NUM. 35. 15. to 35. 1 KING. 2. 31. to 35. In fine; godly and zealous King David, a man after Gods own heart, writes thus of himſelf; PSAL. 101. 8. <hi>I wil early deſtroy ALL THE WICKED of the Land, that I may C<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>T OFF ALL WICKED DOERS FROM THE CITY OF THE LORD.</hi> If David then as a King (yea a type of Chriſt) would thus deſtroy and cut off with the ſword of Juſtice all the <hi>wicked of the Land, and all wicked doers from the City of the Lord:</hi> then certainly he would cut off and deſtroy all Idolaters, Apoſtates, Hereticks, Falſe Teachers, Blaſphemers and obſtinate Schiſmaticks who diſturbed the tranquili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and obſtructed the felicity of the City of the Lord. And why all Chriſtian Princes, Magiſtrates, ſhould not do the like under the Goſpel, as he did under the Law; and puniſh Idolaters, Hereticks, Apoſtates, Blaſphemers, &amp;c. now with corporal and capital puniſhments, as wel as Sorcerers, Murderers, and other Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors, as yet tranſcends my underſtanding to conceive.</p>
            <p>My third Argument follows.</p>
            <p>Thoſe things, and Perſons which Heathen Kings, Magiſtrates, Nations and<note place="margin">Argum. 3.</note> Idolaters themſelves, by the very light of nature, though fit to puniſh with corporal and capital puniſhments; all Chriſtian Kings, Magiſtrates, Nations, ought much more to cenſure in this kind.</p>
            <p>But Heathen Kings, Magiſtrates, Nations, and Idolaters themſelves, by the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry light of nature, have thought fit to puniſh with corporal and capital puniſhments, ſuch as adored not thoſe Idol-gods which they worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and reputed for the true; and ſuch as they deemed Idolaters, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, Hereticks, Schiſmaticks, Blaſphemers, and open Rebels againſt God.</p>
            <p>Therefore Chriſtian Kings, Magiſtrates, Nations under the Goſpel, ought much more to do it.</p>
            <p>The Major is evident by its own light, and ratified by ROM. 2. 14, 15. The Minor <hi>I</hi> ſhal make good by Scripture teſtimonies. I ſhall begin with <hi>King Artaxerxes</hi> his Commiſſion to <hi>Ezra,</hi> c: 7. 15; 26. <hi>And thou</hi> Ezra <hi>after the wiſdom of thy God, that is in thine hand, ſet Magiſtrates and Judges which may judge all the people which are beyond the river; all ſuch as know the Law of thy God: And whoſoever</hi>

               <hi>WIL NOT DO THE LAW OF THY GOD, and the law of the King, let judgement be executed ſpeedily upon him,</hi> WHETHER IT BE TO DEATH, OR TO BANISHMENT, OR TO CONFISCA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION OF GOODS, OR TO IMPRISONMENT. Shal a meer Heathen King be ſo zealous as to enjoyn the Judges and Magiſtrates under him, to inflict theſe corporal and capital cenſures upon ſuch as <hi>wil not do the Law of God;</hi> in which number all Idolaters, Apoſtates, Hereticks, Blaſphemers, &amp;c. are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded; and ſhal not Chriſtian Princes, Magiſtrates, Judges much more exceed him in their zeal and juſtice againſt ſuch tranſgreſſors of Gods Law? But that Decree of Nebuchadnezzer againſt blaſphemers of God, is more emphatical, and pathetical: DAN. 3. 28, 29. <hi>Then Nebuchadnezzer ſpake and ſaid, bleſſed be the Lord God of Shadrach, Meſach, and Abednego, who hath ſent his Angel and delivered his ſervants that truſted in him &amp;c. Therefore I make a Decree,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:64093:9"/>
that every people, nation, and language</hi> WHICH SPEAK ANY ERROR (or <hi>any thing amiſſe</hi>) AGAINST THE GOD of <hi>Shadrach, Meſhach, and Abed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nego,</hi> SHAL BE CUT IN PEECES, and THEIR HOUSES SHAL BEE MADE A DUNGHIL, <hi>becauſe there is no God that can deliver after this ſort.</hi> If this Pagan King out of his tranſcendent zeal, upon the ſight but of one mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, was ſtirred up without any debates or delay, to make ſuch a ſevere decree as this, againſt all thoſe of every people, nation, and language that did ſpeak any Error or Blaſphemy againſt the true God, whom theſe three worthies then, and we now worſhip: ſhal not this decree of his riſe up in Judgement againſt all thoſe Chriſtian Princes, Parliaments, Magiſtrates, Judges under the Goſpel, who profeſſe themſelves the worſhippers, ſervants, children of this true God; and yet ſhal refuſe, or neglect to make ſuch ſtrickt and ſevere Decrees againſt ſuch Hereticks and Blaſphemers, who maliciouſly belch out moſt execrable blaſphemies, and Errors againſt God himſelf, and openly maintain them in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe and writing? but eſpecially againſt thoſe who pretend and ſtile them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the ONLY SAINTS and SERVANTS OF <hi>GOD</hi> (how truly let this one act alone declare) who profeſſedly plead, preach, and write againſt the Corporal and Capital Puniſhment of ſuch damnable Hereticks, Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, and the enacting of any ſevere Laws againſt them by the Parliament and civil Magiſtrates, when as this Pagan King by his Decree commanded ſuch, <hi>to be instantly cut in peeces and their houſes to be made a dunghill,</hi> without any pity or pardon? Were Pagan <hi>Nebuchadnezzer</hi> now alive amongſt us, he would new heat his Fiery Furnace to warm the <hi>kay-cold frozen zeal</hi> of ſuch <hi>heatleſſe New-Lights, and zeal-leſſe Saints</hi> as theſe; or ſhame them into an emulation of his zeal againſt ſuch Hereticks and Blaſphemers.</p>

            <p>So in the 1 ESDRAS c. 6. 23. to 34. It is recorded, <hi>that King Cyrus and Darius by their Royal Decrees commanded the Temple of Jeruſalem to be built unto the Lord, and offrings and prayers to bee there made to the moſt high GOD
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:64093:10"/>
for the King and his children; and commanded that whoſoever ſhould tranſgreſſe, yea or make light of any thing afore written, out of his own houſe ſhould a tree be taken, and HE THERE ON TO BE HANGED and ALL HIS GOODS TO BE SEISED FOR THE KING.</hi> O the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent zeal of theſe Heathen Princes againſt the obſtructers, or oppugners of Gods true worſhip! and ſhal not Chriſtian Kings and Magiſtrates be as zealous againſt Hereticks, Blaſphemers, Schiſmaticks, Seducers, Idolaters, who op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugn, corrupt his truth, and withdraw men from his worſhip?</p>
            <p>I proceed to Preſidents of another Nature.</p>
            <p>We read JUDG. 6. 28. to 32. <hi>That when Gideon in the night time had thrown down the Altar of Baal, and cut down the Grove that was by it, in Ophrata; the men of the City</hi> (who worſhipped Baal) <hi>ſaid one to another, who hath done this thing? and when they had enquired and asked, they ſaid, Gideon the ſon of Joaſh hath done this. Then the men of the City ſaid unto Ioaſh, bring out thy ſon</hi> THAT HE MAY DYE, BECAUSE HE HATH CAST DOWN THE ALTAR OF BAAL, <hi>becauſe he hath cut down the Grove that was by it.</hi> Whence it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, that theſe very Idolaters deemed this afront to their Idol-god, whom they beleeved, adored as the true, to be no leſſe then a capital offence, deſerving death: So in the 1 KING. 18. 13. c. 19. 2. 10. 14. and ROM. 11. 3. 4. we find, that Idolatrous <hi>Queen Iezabel</hi> who worſhipped Baal as the true God, and drew Ahab her husband and his ſubjects to her Idolatry, <hi>did ſlay the Prophets of the Lord with the ſword, and threw down his Altar, and ſeek the Prophet Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jahs life, who was enforced to flie to ſave it,</hi> becauſe ſhee deemed him and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets ſhe ſlew to be Hereticks, Falſe Prophets, Blaſphemers, Oppoſers of her Idol-Baal, and his Idolatrous worſhip, then generally received as the true. So DAN. 3. 1. <hi>when King Nebuchadnezzer erected an Image of gold, as his god, which he made choyce of for him and all his people to worſhip, he made a publike Proclamation by an Herald, that all people, nations, and languages aſſembled to its dedication, ſhould fall down and worſhip this golden Image,</hi> and that who ſo fell not down and worſhipped it, SHOULD BE CAST INTO A BURNING FIERY FURNACE, And for diſobeying this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, <hi>Shadrach, Meſhach, and Abednego were caſt into his furnace</hi> as Malefactors: Thus ACTS 16. 16 to 35.

Thus <hi>Paul</hi> before his converſion, out of the like falſ zeal, <hi>made havock of the Church, entring into every houſe and hailing men and women, committed them to priſon: And yet breathing out threatnings and flaughters against the Diſciples of the Lord, he deſired letters of the High Prieſt to Damaſcus, to the Synagogues, that if he found any of this way man or woman,</hi> he might bring them bound unto Jeruſalem, ACT. 8. 1. 3. c. 9. 1, 2.

               <hi>Euſebius.</hi> The latter part concerning <hi>Hereticks and falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, who ſpeak lyes in the name of the Lord,</hi> relates likewiſe to the times of the Goſpel: wherein two things are conſiderable; Firſt, their judgement and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment; <hi>Thou ſhalt not live; and they ſhal thruſt him through when he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſieth.</hi> A capital ſentence and execution, to the very taking away of their lives. Secondly, The parties who are to pronounce and execute this Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; <hi>his Father and Mother that begat him:</hi> (an expreſſion borrowed from <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. 6, 7, 8, 9.) This may have a threefold interpretation: Firſt, <hi>His natural Father and Mother</hi> ſhal do it, if living, upon lawful conviction before the Chriſtian Magiſtrate. Secondly, <hi>His Civil or Eccleſiastical Father and Mother</hi> (eſpecially if his natural Parents be dead) to wit, the Chriſtian Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, Church, and people where he liveth. Thirdly, his very <hi>neereſt, deareſt friends and kindred,</hi> who muſt caſt aſide all affection in the cauſe of God. And this part of the Prophecy was fulfilled under the Goſpel, by the manygodly Laws of Chriſtian Emperors, Kings, States in all ages, for the puniſhing of Hereticks, and ſeducing falſe Teachers with Baniſhment, Impriſonment, Burning, Death, and other corporal cenſures, of which more anon.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the good effect of theſe corporal cenſures and puniſhments upon Idolaters, Hereticks, and Falſe Prophets, is thus expreſſed in the Text. Firſt, <hi>The name of Idols ſhal no more be remembred.</hi> Secondly, <hi>The falſe prophet and unclean ſpirit ſhal paſſe out of the Land.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Every other falſe prophet ſhal be aſhamed of his viſion, and no more wear a rough garment to deceive,</hi> but give over his falſe Teaching. So that the Magiſtrates and others ſevere proceedings by corporal and capital cenſures againſt Idolaters and Falſe Prophets, is a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal means predicted and ordained by God even under the Goſpel, to extirpate Idolatry, Hereſie, Errours, Falſe Prophets, and reclaim ſuch as have been ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by them.

            <p>Apoſtacy, Idolatry, Hereſie, Blaſphemy, obſtinate Schiſm, Falſe Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, together with falſe Prophets, who are guilty of them, are as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious unto God, as execrable to all godly Chriſtians, as infectious, dangerous, deſtructive to peoples ſouls, as apt to provoke Gods wrath, and bring down his ſevere judgements upon whole Churches, Nations, Kingdoms, where they are tolerated, perpetrated, and are as carefully to be ſuppreſſed, prevented under the Goſpel, as they were under the Law: Yea Chriſtian Princes, Magiſtrates, Republicks power under the Goſpel is the ſame, or as large as the authority of godly Kings and Magiſtrates under the Law.</p>
            <p>Therefore conſequently they are to be as ſeverely puniſhed with corporal, if not capital puniſhments under the Goſpel by Chriſtian Princes, Magiſtrates, Republicks, as they were by godly Kings and Magiſtrates under the Law.</p>
            <p>The ſequel is clear from its own light; for where there is the ſelf ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, there is ever the ſelf-ſame law and equity, both under the Law and Goſpel. See <hi>Mat. 7. 11, 12. Luke</hi> 6. 30. to 35. <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 10, 11. as I have formerly proved, <hi>p.</hi> 2. 3. 5.</p>
            <p>The Antecedent is undeniable: Firſt, becauſe the Goſpel doth no ways mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigate, <hi>but rather aggravate the hainouſnes of theſe ſins, as being committed againſt greater light and mercy; therefore certainly they are as odious, as provoking unto God, as execrable, damnable, destructive unto men, as pernicious unto whole Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Nations, Kingdomes now, as then, and in ſome ſence more now, then former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under the Law,</hi> as is clear by <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 18. to the end, 1 <hi>Cor. 6. 9, 10. cap. 10. 7. 9. 11.

So upon the like reaſon, the New Teſtament is far more frequent in exhorting Chriſtians under the Goſpel to beware of Hereticks, Schiſmaticks, and Falſe Teachers, then of Idolaters; and of Hereſie and Errors in Religion, then of Idolatry, becauſe Idolaters under the Goſpel (when moſt Idolatrous Nations ſhould be converted, and the vanity, the falſe-hood of Idolatry fully diſcovered) ſhould be nothing ſo dangerous, ſo infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious, ſo numerous, ſo diligent and cunning to ſeduce men as Hereticks, Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks, Falſe Teachers; and Idolatrie, nothing ſo apt to ſeduce men to it as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical and erroneous Tenets, which have a more ſpecious ſhew of truth, and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter colour of warrant from the Scriptures, then Idolatry.

That Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Kings, States, Magiſtrates, under the Goſpel, have the ſelf-ſame Power and Commiſſion as godly Kings, States, Magiſtrates had under the Law, I have former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manifeſted, and is undeniably proved by <note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>Gualther</hi> Hom 76. in Epiſt. ad <hi>Rom.</hi>

            <p>Magiſtrates, Kings, Rulers, and the Higher powers under the Goſpel it ſelf <q>are ordained, continued by God and men for this very end among others, to be a terror to evil doers and workers; to be Gods Miniſters, Avengers to execute wrath upon them that do evil, and not to bear the ſword in vain, being ſent FOR THE PUNISHMENT OF EVIL DOERS: Nay, Chriſtians themſelves are to obey, ſubmit unto them, and injoyned to pray for them, that under them they may live a peaceable life IN ALL GODLINESSE and HONESTY, they being the Miniſters of God for their good,</q> ROM. 13. 1. to 6. 1 PET. 2. 13, 14.

Yea Chriſt himſelf com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands <q>his diſciples when they ſhould be brought before them, nay SCOURGED, KILLED and PUT TO DEATH BY THEM, not to diſpute their power, as ſome do now, but to ſubmit unto it (as he did to Pilates) MAT. 10. 17, 18. 21. LUK. 22. 12. 17. JOHN. 16. 2, 3. Upon which grounds, Paul being brought before Feſtus, Felix, &amp; Agrippa, and accuſed by the Jews of HERESY, ſtirring up of ſedition among the Jews throughout the world, teaching againſt the Law, and defiling the Temple, juſtified himſelf, and denyed theſe accuſations, but demurred not to their Juriſdiction; uſing this notable ſpeech, ACT. 25. 10.</q> IF I BE AN OFFENDOR, OR HAVE COM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MITTED ANY THING VVORTHY OF DEATH, IREFUSE NOT TO DYE: BUT IF THERE BE NONE OF THESE

            <p>Therefore by theſe Goſpel Texts and Preſidents, Chriſtian Magiſtrates, Kings, Rulers, and the Higher Powers under the Goſpel, have right to inflict corporal, pecuniary, and capital Puniſhments upon notorious dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Idolaters, Apoſtates, Hereticks, Blaſphemers, Falſe Teachers, and obſtinate Schiſmaticks, who are <hi>evil doers</hi> in the higheſt degree, diſhonoring and <hi>blaſpheming God, undermining Religion, ſubverting the faith of many, bringing upon themſelves and others ſwift damnation; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbing the Peace, Order, Doctrins of the Church, and bringing down Gods Wrath, Judgements on the Churches, States, Kingdoms wherein they live, and deſtroy the very ſtock and faith of Chriſt as much as in them lies,</hi> Rom. 16. 17, 18.

of God, and hath counted the blood of the Covenant, where with he was ſanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done deſpite unto the Spirit of Grace? For we know him that hath ſaid, Vengeance is mine, I wil recompence ſaith the Lord: And again; The Lord wil judge his people. It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</hi> From this text (as likewiſe from <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 1, 2. and <hi>cap.</hi> 6. 1. to 9. which are in ſome ſort paralelled with it) it is moſt apparent:</p>
            <p>Firſt, that the ſins of Apoſtacy, Blaſphemy, Hereſy, contempt of Chriſt and his blood, and deſpiting of his Spirit, by Chriſtians, are far more heinous, great, and more unpardonable under the Goſpel then they were under the Law.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that they are worthy of much ſorer puniſhment under the Goſpel, then under the Law: Wherefore ſince thoſe who were guilty of them and deſpiſed <hi>Moſes</hi> Law <hi>dyed without mercy</hi> (by the hand of the Magiſtrate and people) <hi>under two or three witneſſes</hi> under the Law; thoſe who are guilty of them under the Goſpel, <hi>deſerving much ſorer puniſhment,</hi> may likewiſe be put to death by the Chriſtian Magiſtrate <hi>without mercy,</hi> and puniſhed with more ſevere temporal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments then any were under the Law; becauſe their ſin is more hainous, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves <hi>much ſorer puniſhment,</hi> as the text expreſly reſolves; which I wiſh our Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſites, and all Chriſtian States, Magiſtrates would ſeriouſly conſider, who deem the times of the Goſpel times of greater indulgence, connivance, and mercy towards ſuch capital Tranſgreſſors, then the times of the Law.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that if Magiſtrates and others neglect, or refuſe to puniſh ſuch enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Tranſgreſſors under the Goſpel, God himſelf wil take vengeance on, judge, and recompence them, and they ſhal fall into the hands of the <hi>living God;</hi> which is a more <hi>fearful</hi> thing then to fall into the hand of men.</p>
            <p>Now if any ſhould hence infer (as our Oppoſites do) that ſuch muſt be left<note place="margin">Object.</note> wholy to the hands, judgement and vengeance of God himſelf, who reſerves ſuch for his own Tribunal, and hath exempted them from the inferior Magiſtrates Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction by this text.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, that the text wil warrant no ſuch inference: For firſt, it is but a bare<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> recital of <hi>Gods own Words in the Old Teſtament,</hi> Deut. 32. 35. 39, 40, 41, 42, 43. Now in the Old Teſtament, the vengeance, puniſhment inflicted by God himſelf upon Apoſtates, Idolaters, as on the Iſraelites, Midianites, Canaanites, and others, did not exclude but include the Temporal Magiſtrates Cenſures, and the uſe of ſecondary Inſtruments; as is moſt apparent by <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 26. to the end; Where <hi>Moſes SLEW about three thouſand men for worſhipping the Golden calf, and yet God plagued the people for the ſame ſinn too:</hi> and <hi>Numb.</hi> 25. 3. to 16. <hi>Where</hi> Moſes <hi>for the ſin of</hi> Peor <hi>hanged up the heads of the people before the Lord againſt the Sun; the Judges of Iſrael ſlew every one his men that were joyned unto</hi> Baal Peor, <hi>and</hi> Phineas <hi>ſlew</hi> Zimri <hi>and</hi> Cozbi <hi>with a Javelin; and yet God himſelf at the ſame time ſlew twenty four thouſand more of the people with the Plague for the ſame ſin.</hi> And by <hi>Joſh.</hi> chap. 9. to 13. and <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 19. Where God himſelf uſeth the Iſraelites <hi>to destroy his enemies the Canaanites, and other Idolatrous Nations.</hi> Therefore this ſentence under the New Teſtament, <hi>Vengeance is mine, &amp;c.</hi> no more exempts ſuch Malefactors, as the text ſpeaks of, from the capital puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Magiſtrates and others, under the Goſpel, then it did under the Law.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Goſpel informs us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 4. That every Chriſtian Ruler
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64093:15"/>
and Magiſtrate, <hi>is the Miniſter of God, and his REVENGER, to execute wrath upon him that doth evil:</hi> And their <hi>Vengeance and Judgement</hi> is not their own but <hi>Gods, on whoſe Tribunal they ſit, and whoſe Perſon they repreſent,</hi> as is evident by <hi>Deut.</hi> 1. 17. <hi>Ye ſhal not reſpect perſons in Judgement,</hi> for THE JUDGEMENT IS <hi>GODS.</hi> 2 Chron. 19. 6. <hi>And</hi> Jehoſhaphat <hi>ſaid to the Judges, take heed what ye do;</hi> for <hi>ye iudge not for men, but FOR THE LORD, who is with you in the Judgement.</hi> Prov. 29. 26. <hi>Many ſeek the face of a Ruler, but every mans Judgement COMETH FROM THE LORD.</hi> 2 Chron. 9. 8. <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord thy God which delighted in thee, to ſet thee</hi> ON HIS THRONE <hi>to be</hi> KING FOR THE LORD THY GOD, <hi>becauſe the Lord loved</hi> Iſrael, <hi>therefore made he thee King over them, to do Justice and Judgment.</hi> Prov. 8. 15. By me Kings reign, and Princes DE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CREE JUSTICE. And <hi>Dan.</hi> 4. 24. <hi>The moſt high</hi> RULETH IN THE KINGDOM OF MEN, <hi>and giveth it to whomſoever he will:</hi> As God and Chriſt are ſaid to preach the Goſpel in and by the Miniſters of it; as our Antagoniſts themſelves wil grant: So they are likewiſe ſaid to <hi>execute wrath and vengeance</hi> in and by the Magiſtrates. Therefore this fond Objection (whereon our Oppoſites much inſiſt) muſt needs evaporate into ſmoak; and this Text re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main an unanſwerable proof for the Chriſtian Magiſtrates power to puniſh Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, Hereticks, Blaſphemers, Contemners of Chriſt, his blood, his Covenant, and the Spirit of Grace, with more grievous corporal and capital puniſhments under the Goſpel, then under the Law.</p>
            <p>My ninth Argument ſhal be from the 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 1. to 14. <hi>But there were falſe Prophets alſo among the people, even as there ſhal be falſe Teachers among you,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Argum. 9.</note> 
               <hi>who privily ſhal bring in</hi> DAMNABLE HERESIES, even denying the Lord that bought them; and ſhall BRING UPON THEMSELVES SWIFT DESTRUCTION. <hi>And many ſhal follow their pernicious ways, by reaſon of whom the way of truth ſhal be evil ſpoken off. And through covetouſneſſe ſhal they with fained words make merchandize of you; whoſe judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment now of a long time lingreth not, and their damnation ſlumbreth not: For if God spared not the Angels that ſinned, but caſt them down into hell, and delivered them into chains of darkneſſe, to be reſerved unto Judgement: And spared not the old World, but ſaved Noah the eight perſon, a preacher of righteouſneſſe, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Flood upon the world of the ungodly: And turning the Cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into aſhes, condemned them with an overthrow, making them an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſample unto thoſe that after ſhould live ungodly, &amp;c. The Lord knoweth how to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the godly out of temptations, and to reſerve the unjuſt unto the day of Judgment to be puniſhed; But chiefly them that walk after the fleſh in the lust of uncleanneſſe, and deſpiſe government; preſumptuous are they, ſelf-willed, they are not affraid to speak evill of dignities: Whereas Angels, which are greater in power and might, bring not rayling accuſations againſt them before the Lord: But theſe, as natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral bruite beaſts, made to be taken and deſtroyed, speak evil of the things they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand not, and ſhal utterly periſh in their own corruption: And ſhal receive the reward of unrighteouſneſſe, &amp;c.</hi> The very ſame expreſſions in ſubſtance, if not in words, we have repeated in <hi>Jude,</hi> v. 4. to 23.</p>

               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:64093:17"/>Fifthly, Admit it meant of the general day of Judgement, yet God reſerves not Falſe Teachers and damnable Hereticks till that day to be puniſhed with eternal damnation and deſtruction, but where Magiſtrates neglect to puniſh them with temporal damnation and deſtruction, which through Gods bleſſing might be a means to free them from eternal. So that this Text duly conſidered, is in my apprehenſion a ſufficient warrant and commiſſion for all Chriſtian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates under the Goſpel, ſpeedily to puniſh all falſ Teachers, who privately or openly bring in damnable Hereſies with ſwift deſtruction, and capitall cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures inflicted by them upon conviction, in a way of Juſtice.</p>
            <p>My ninth Argument is this:</p>
            <p>Hereticks, Falſe Teachers, Seducers, and obſtinate Schiſmaticks are ſtiled, not<note place="margin">Argum. 9.</note> only in the Old but New Teſtament, <hi>Foxes, litle foxes, Wolves in ſheeps clothing, ravenous, grievous Wolves who ſpoil and devour the Flock; yea, Theeves and Robbers, who come only to ſteal, kil, and deſtroy Chriſts ſheep,</hi> and the like. <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 15. <hi>Math.</hi> 7. 15. <hi>John</hi> 10. 8. to 14. <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 29, 30. And not only Miniſters, but likewiſe godly Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates are the <hi>Shepherds and Paſtors of Chriſts flock,</hi> to preſerve, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them from, and chaſe away, take, and if need be, <hi>deſtroy and kil theſe Foxes, Wolves, Theeves, Robbers, 2 Chron.</hi> 18. 16. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 78. 76. 71, 72, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. 23. <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 15. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 2.</p>
            <p>As therefore Shepherds lawfully may and ought to drive away Foxes, Wolves, Theeves, Lyons, Bears, and other beaſts of prey from their ſheepfolds, and <hi>take and kil them too,</hi> for the preſervation of their flocks, as <hi>David did kil the Lyon and the Bear</hi> that devoured his Fathers ſheep, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. 34, 35, 36. <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 15. <hi>Jer</hi> 31. 4. <hi>John</hi> 10. 12, 13. So doubtleſſe godly Chriſtian Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates and Shepherds under the Goſpel, may, yea ought to chaſe away and baniſh theſe pernicious Foxes, theſe <hi>ravenous grievous Wolves, Bears, Lyons, Theeves which devour their flocks,</hi> and apprehend and kil them too where they ſee juſt cauſe, to preſerve Chriſts ſheep from <hi>being devoured,</hi> and his flock <hi>from being deſtroyed by them:</hi> Theſe very Titles wherewith the Scripture brands them, being a <note n="*" place="margin">See here <hi>p.</hi>

We read <hi>Exod.</hi> 21. 28, 29. <hi>If an Ox gore a man or woman, that they dye, then the Ox ſhal be ſurely ſtoned, and the owner quit: But if the Ox were wont to puſh with his horn in time paſt, and it hath been teſtified to his owner, and he hath not kept him in, but that he hath killed a man or woman, the Ox ſhal be ſtoned, and the OWNER ALSO SHAL BE PUT TO DEATH.</hi> Certainly if an Ox that kils the body but of one man or woman with his horn muſt thus be ſtoned to death, and his owner too, for not reſtraining him, if he formerly uſed puſhing; then much more may ſeducing Hereticks. Falſe Teachers, Blaſphemers, Schiſmaticks, who gore the ſouls of hundreds to death, and thoſe Magiſtrates who willingly countenance and keep them not in by Laws and Puniſhments from goring the ſouls of others that they dye, be puniſhed, and <hi>put to death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My tenth Argument ſhal be this: The Apoſtle informes us <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 19, 20.<note place="margin">Argum. 10.</note> That <hi>Idolatry, Schiſms, Hereſies</hi> are <hi>works of the fleſh,</hi> not Spirit; and couples them with <hi>Witchcrafts</hi> and <hi>Murders;</hi> adding, <hi>that thoſe who do ſuch things ſhal not inherit the Kingdom of God:</hi> Yea he informes us <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 32. <hi>That thoſe
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:64093:17"/>
who commit ſuch things ARE WORTHY OF DEATH.</hi> And 1 <hi>Tim. 1. 9, 10. The Law is not made for the righteous man</hi> (that is, to reſtrain and puniſh him) <hi>but for the lawleſſe and diſobedient, for the ungodly and for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, for the unholy and prophane, for murderers of Fathers and murderers of Mothers, for man-ſlayers, &amp;c. and ANY OTHER THING CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TRARY TO SOUND DOCTRINE:</hi> Whereas <hi>againſt the fruits of the Spirit there is no Law,</hi> Gal. 5. 22, 23. that is to puniſh them, or any Chriſtians for them. Whence I thus argue.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Hereſies, Idolatry, Schiſms, &amp; Blaſphemies</hi> too, (as Chriſt reſolves <hi>Mat. 15. 19, Mar.</hi> 2. 22.) be <hi>works of the fleſh,</hi> not Spirit, as wel as <hi>Witchcraft, Murders, deſerving death</hi> as wel as they; and the Law of God is made for the puniſhment of <hi>the diſobedient, ungodly, unholy, and prophane, and whatſoever is contrary to ſound doctrine,</hi> as wel as for <hi>Murderers of Fathers and Mothers, and Man-ſlayers;</hi> then the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Magiſtrate under the Goſpel, when he ſees juſt cauſe, may and ought by the Law of God to puniſh men with corporal, and capital puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for Hereſies, Idolatry, Blaſphemies, and dangerous Schiſmes, being <hi>works of the fleſh,</hi> as well as for Murther, Witchcraft; and ſuch as murther and deſtroy mens ſouls, as wel as thoſe who only mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their bodies; ſince no reaſon can be rendred out of Scripture, why they ſhould puniſh ſome <hi>works of the fleſh</hi> only, and not others.</p>
            <p>But the Suppoſition is true, and ratified by the forecited texts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Sequel cannot be gainſaid, but muſt be granted.<note place="margin">Object.</note>
            </p>
            <p>If <note n="*" place="margin">Mr <hi>Dells</hi> Right Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, <hi>p.</hi> 20, 21, 22, 23. comparedwith <hi>p.</hi> 1, 2.</note> any Object, <hi>That the Subjects of Chriſts Kingdom are a spiritual people, born of the Spirit, and therefore without the reach of any outward force, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond not only the power, but cognizance of the Magiſtrate &amp; ſecular powers, which are but a carnal and worldly Institution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, Firſt, <hi>that the Hereſies, Errors, Schiſms, Blasphemies</hi> of ſuch as are pretended to be a <hi>spiritual people and Subjects of Chriſts Kingdom, born of</hi>
               <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> 
               <hi>the Spirit,</hi> are meerly <hi>carnal and works of the fleſh,</hi> not <hi>Spirit,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſolves; therefore admit the Magiſtrate and ſecular power to be but a <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Ordinance,</hi> they are yet within the reach and cognizance both of their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and cenſure, as well as Treaſons, Murthers and other Felonies of ſuch Saints and ſpiritual people.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Argument is but a meer fallacy: Fleſh and blood and the Civil Magiſtrate hath nothing to do with them that are born of the Spirit, in things of the Spirit. <hi>Ergo,</hi> It hath nothing to do with them in the fruits and works of their fleſh, which deſerve both puniſhment and cenſure.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, This Objection caſts a ſcandal &amp; reproach upon Magiſtrates and their Authority, in calling them, the <hi>power of the world, fleſh and blood, a car<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Fourthly, It is a meer <hi>Popish Argument</hi> uſed by the Pope and Popiſh Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy <hi>in former times</hi> to exempt themſelves from all ſecular power, abuſing that text of 1 <hi>Cor. 2. 15. But he that is ſpiritual judgeth all thing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Eccleſiae Brit.</hi> p. 245. and ſundry Popiſh Authors <hi>De Immunitate et Exemptione Clericorum.</hi> So that theſe New-Lights who pretend themſelves moſt oppoſite to Popery, do but in truth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive it among us in an higher degree then ever, by giving to all thoſe they pleaſe to ſtile <hi>Saints, ſpiritual people,</hi> or <hi>the faithful,</hi> the very ſame, yea a greater ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption from the civil Magiſtrates power, then ever the Papiſts gave unto their Clergy only, and no others.</p>
            <p>My eleventh Argument is this:<note place="margin">Argum. 11.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Private Chriſtians are ſtrictly and frequently enjoyned <hi>to beware of, avoyde, turn away from, and not to receive, or admit into their houſes, any Hereticks, Apoſtates, Schiſmaticks, or falſe Teachers:</hi> Matth. 7. 15. Rom. 16. 17, 18. Phil. 3. 2. 2 Tim. 2. 16. 17. c. 3. 5, 6. c. 4. 15. 2 Pet. c. 3. 17. 2 John 10. 11. Yea when and where there were no Chriſtian Magiſtrates to reſtrain and puniſh them, the Apoſtles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>delivered them unto Satan,</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 19, 20. <hi>Wiſhed</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Fromwhence <hi>Ferom, Gualter Beza, Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> &amp; many others, infer; the lawſulneſs of puniſhing Hereticks with death.</note> 
               <hi>that they were even cut off for troubling the Church,</hi> Gal. 5. 12. <hi>Willed Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to ſtop their mouthes, rebuke them ſharply, and after the firſt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond admonition to reject; becauſe they ſubverted whole houſes, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw the faith of many,</hi> Tit. 1. 11. 13. c. 3. 10, 11. 2 Pet. 2. 1, 2. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 18. And <hi>the Churches of Pergamus, Thyatira, and the Angels of them, when they had no Chriſtian Magistrates, are particularly blamed by God, for ſuffering ſuch who held the doctrine of Baalam and of the Nicholai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans which Chriſt hated: and for SUFFERING that woman.</hi> Jezebel, <hi>who called her ſelf a Propheteſſe, to teach and ſeduce his ſervants to commit fornication and to eat things ſacrificed unto Idols. Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to caſt her, and thoſe that committed fornication with her, into great tribulation, unleſſe they repented;</hi> Yea, ſaying, <hi>I WIL KIL HER CHILDREN WITH DEATH; and all the Churches shal know, that I am he which ſearcheth the reins and heart; and I wil give unto every of you according to your works,</hi> Rom. 2. 14. to 24.</p>
            <p>Therefore when and where there are Chriſtian Magiſtrates; they may and muſt by like reaſon, expel, reject, baniſh ſuch out of their Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; not admit them into their territories; cut them off for troubling the Church: ſtop their mouthes; and not ſuffer them to teach and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce their people: yea, <hi>kil them and their children</hi> (where there is juſt cauſe) <hi>with death:</hi> ſince Chriſt himſelf threatens to do it (not only immediately by himſelf, but alſo mediately by the Magiſtrates, who are his Miniſters, Avengers, and muſt not bear the Sword in vain, but puniſh ſuch evil doers with it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 3, 4.) and to render to them according to their works.</p>
            <p>The Argument holds undeniably, becauſe Chriſtian Princes and Magiſtrates are the Nurſing fathers of the Church, to defend, protect it againſt theſe Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers and devouring wolves, to preſerve the peace, the unity of it, and the purity of Doctrine and worſhip in it, as the Scripture warrants, and Divines have ever aſſerted in all ages of the Church, til ſome New-Lights and Sectaries
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:64093:18"/>
of late oppoſed it in others, to procure impunity to themſelves, to vent their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors without controle.</p>
            <p>My twelfth Argument ſhal be deduced from theſe following Goſpel Texts,<note place="margin">Argum. 12.</note> 
               <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 27. Where Chriſt, after the Parable of the <hi>Talents,</hi> concludes thus: <hi>But thoſe mine Enemies that would not that I ſhould reign over them, bring hither AND SLAY THEM BEFORE MY FACE.</hi> Chriſt doth not ſlay them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately himſelf, but the Magiſtrates <hi>who are his Miniſters; ſervants</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 13. 4.</note> revengers; <hi>they</hi> are <hi>to bring and ſlay them before his face,</hi> for their Treaſon and Rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. <hi>Mat. 21. 33. to 44. Mark 12. 1. to 12. Luke 20. 9, to 19. Where the Lord of the Vineyard, who let it out to huſbandmen; who ſtoned his ſervants and killed his Son, when he cometh; he wil miſerably DESTROY thoſe wicked men and let out his Vineyard to other huſbandmen, which ſhal render him the fruits in due ſeaſon;</hi> (which Parable was experimentably verified in the deſtruction of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> and the <hi>Jews</hi> by the <hi>Romans.</hi>) And it is added: <hi>Whoſoever ſhal fall on this ſtone (Christ) ſhal be broken; but on whomſoever it ſhal fal, IT SHAL GRIND HIM TO POWDER.</hi> Mat. 22. 2. to 8. <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a certain King which made a marriage for his ſon; and ſent his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to cal them that were bidden to the wedding, but they would not come, &amp;c. And the remnant took his ſervants, and intreated them ſpitefully, and ſlew them: But when the King heard thereof, he was wroth, and ſent forth his armies, and DE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STROYED THOSE MURDERERS, and burnt up their City:</hi> Really veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the Jews too. To which I ſhal ſubjoyn <hi>Rev. 11. 17, 18. We give thee thanks, O Lord God Almighty, which art, and waſt, and art to come, becauſe thou haſt taken unto thee thy great power, and haſt reigned: And the time is come thou ſhouldest DESTROY THEM WHICH CORRUPT THE EARTH.</hi> Compared with <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 5. 16. where it is thus prophecyed <hi>of the deſtruction of the whore of Babylon the great, the mother of fornications, &amp; abominations of the earth. The ten horns which thou ſawſt upon the beaſt</hi> (w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> are 10. Kings) <hi>theſe ſhal hate the whore, and make her deſolate and naked, and SHAL EAT HER FLESH &amp; BURN HER WITH FIRE; for God hath put it into their hearts TO FULFIL HIS WIL.</hi> And <hi>Rev. 19. 19, 20, 21. And I ſaw the beaſt, and the Kings of the earth, and their armies gathered together to make war againſt him that ſate on the horſe: And the beaſt was taken, and with him the falſe prophet, that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beaſt, &amp; them that worſhipped his image. Theſe both were caſt into A LAKE WHICH BURNETH WITH FIRE &amp; BRIMSTONE. And the remnant WERE SLAIN WITH THE SWORD of him that ſate upon the horſe, which ſword proceeded out of his mouth: and all the fouls were filled with their fleſh.</hi> From all theſe Parabolical Expreſſions in the New Teſtament it ſelf, of things to be acted by God the Father, by Jeſus Chriſt himſelf &amp; his ſervants (the Magiſtrates) under the Goſpel, I ſhal draw theſe Concluſions neceſſarily flowing from them.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That God the Father and Jeſus Chriſt are altogether as rigorous and ſevere (if not far more ridged and mercileſſe) againſt their profeſſed Enemies, Antichriſtian Oppoſers, Perſecuters, and falſe Prophets under the Goſpel, as they were under the Law, which theſe Texts, together with <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 1, 2. and c. 10. 26. to 32. and <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. 10. to the end; undeniably manifeſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:64093:19"/>Secondly, That ſuch as thoſe ſhall be puniſhed with capital and corporal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments even under the Goſpel by Chriſt his Miniſters, Soldiers, Revengers, who bear his Sword; (who are principally, orthodox Chriſtian Kings and Magiſtrates) as theſe ſeveral expreſſions manifeſt; <hi>Slay them before my face<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He will miſerably deſtroy theſe wicked men, and murderers, burn up their City, grind them to powder; thou ſhalt deſtroy them which corrupt the earth: The ten hornes ſhal make the whore deſolate and naked, and ſhal eat her fleſh and burn her with fier; And the beast and falſe prophet were taken and caſt into a lake which burneth with fier and brimſtone</hi> (the ground of the ancient Writ <hi>De Haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tico comburendo,</hi> and of burning Hereticks;) <hi>and the rest were ſlain with the ſword, and all the fouls were filled with their fleſh.</hi>

               <hi>the horſe,</hi> in this Text; is not the meer preaching of the Word and Goſpel, as is pretended; but Chriſts denouncing of Sentence, of Judgement, and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ſame upon them, not as a Preacher, but as a Judge: this is clear by <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 2. <hi>Come hither and I wil ſhew thee the</hi> Judgment <hi>of the great whore &amp;c.</hi> Rev. 18. 8. <hi>Shee ſhall bee utterly burnt with fier, for ſtrong is the Lord who J<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>DGETH her:</hi> Rev. 16. 21, 22. <hi>Rejoyce over her thou heaven, and ye holy Apoſtles and Prophets, for God hath avenged you on her.

            <p>I ſhal only add to theſe Arguments, the conſtant practiſe of many godly Emperors, Kings, States, who, in all ages, ſince they became Chriſtian, have enacted Laws, and preſcribed ſeveral pecuniary, corporal and capital Puniſhments, and ſometimes baniſhment againſt Hereticks, falſe Teachers, obſtinate Schiſmaticks, Apoſtates, and Blaſphemers. To recite all their Laws at large, would ſwel this Pamphlet into a large Volume, I ſhal give you, for the moſt part, but an Epitome of the chiefeſt of them, which the ſtudious may peruſe at leiſure in the Authors out of which I quote them.</p>
            <p>I ſhal begin with Laws and Puniſhments only againſt Hereticks, Apoſtates, falſe Teachers, or obſtinate Schiſmaticks, and then proceed to Laws, and Puniſhments againſt Blaſphemy and Blaſphemers.</p>

Sect. 4. p. 21, 22, 23. where ſpeaking of <hi>Crimes and their Diviſion,</hi> &amp; of the <hi>Crime</hi> of <hi>Treaſon;</hi> he writes thus: <q>Crime of Majeſty (or Treaſon) is an horrible ſinne done to the King; and this is either to the KING CAELESTIAL, or Terreſtriall, Againſt the King of heaven in three manners, by HERESY, Sorcery, Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: HERESY is an evill and falſe beliefe ariſing from Error in the right Chriſtian faith: In this ſinne is Sorcery and Divination, which are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of hereſy; and ariſe from an evill beliefe. After which he enumerates the ſeverall ſorts of Sorceries and Divinations, contrary to the Law of God and the Church, and to the right faith, for which they are to be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended and removed from among the people of God, that ſo no good Chriſtian may be taken with their act, nor partner with their ſinne. Chap. 2. Sect. 22. p. 141, 142. he writes thus. Of the Crime of Treaſon or Majeſty, there is no eſpeciall or large Enditement, but OF HERESY, and Sorcery: Of which if any be indited and drawn into judgment, this is the Inditement, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceable for the King by any of his people in this manner, according as it is found IN THE ROLLES OF ANCIENT KINGS. <note n="*" place="margin">The forme of an Inditement agáinſt an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick and ſorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer in ancient times.</note> I ſay <hi>Sebourge</hi> here is defamed by good people of the THE CRIME OF HERESY, for this, that from an ill art and beliefe forbidden, and by charmes and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment, he took from <hi>Brightient</hi> by name, on ſuch a day, &amp;c. the flower of his beare, by which he loſt the vent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or thus: <hi>Molling,</hi> who is here, is defamed by good men, that on ſuch a day, &amp;c. he renounced his baptiſme, and cauſed himſelfe to be circumciſed and became a Jew or Saracen; or offered or ſacrificed unto Mahomet in deſpite of God, and in damnation of his ſoule, and this ſinne he did FELONIOVSLY, &amp;c. And if he will deny it, I am ready to prove it for the King, as belongs to the King to do; Chap. 4. Sect 11. p. 42. he defines, that deadly ſinnes are to be puniſhed with death: and mortall paine; and that ſuch puniſhments are warranted by the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, and to be inflicted to prevent eternall death. After which Sect. 14. p. 252. Of the puniſhment of Treaſon; he determines thus: That Sodomy is to be puniſhed, with burying the party alive under ground; Sorcery by burning in the fire.

be delivered to the ſecular power by the Clergy, to do with him as the King ſhall pleaſe; and then it is like the King may pardon him, if he will, or grant a Writ <hi>De Haeretico comburendo</hi> to burne him.

            <p>5ly. That an Hereticke and Apoſtate legally indicted and convicted in the Kings Courts before the Iudges for Hereſie or Apoſtacy, and adjudged to be burnt, may at this day by the common Law be executed without ſuch a Writ, by vertue of the judgement only, by the Sheriffe (who is an Officer to the Court) as well as other Felons may be and are uſually executed in other caſes without a Writ. And if the Parliament will be pleaſed by a Law to declare, what are <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies</hi> in particular, and what <hi>Heretickes</hi> and <hi>Apoſtates</hi> in ſpeciall ſhall be indicted and proceeded againſt at the common Law: as they did heretofore in caſe of <hi>Treaſons</hi> by the Stat. of 25.

            <p>Now the reaſons which confirme me in this opinion, That all <hi>Hereſies,</hi> Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, Schiſmes, Apoſtacies, Idolatries are triable and puniſhable in a criminall or Capitall manner, only by an indictment and legall Tryall at the common Law, but not upon any ſentence given by the Clergy in Convocation, or the Biſhops in their Conſiſtories, are theſe: Firſt, becauſe the Prieſts under the Law, were neither appointed to condemne nor execute ſuch (unleſſe upon extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary

               <hi>cannot ſuppreſſe the true faith and Doctrine of Ieſus Chriſt, nor hinder the prevailing progreſſe of it, which commonly ſpreads faſteſt under the hotteſt perſecutions;</hi> yet it is moſt true, that execrable Hereſies, Errors, Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and Schiſmes contrary to Gods word, may be and alwayes have beene ſuppreſſed, yea extirpated by temporall Lawes and puniſhments in all Ages, when no other meanes could prevaile to do it; and where ſuch Laws are moſt ſeverely executed, there Hereſies, Errors, Schiſmes, blaſphemies, either break not out at all, or are ſoone ſuppreſſed, and never grow Epidemicall, or of long continuance.</p>
            <p>From all which Lawes and conſiderations, I ſhall deduce this Argument, as auxiliary to the former.</p>
            <p>Thoſe things which the moſt pious, zealous, and devout Emperors; Kings, Magiſtrates, States, even at the prayer or requeſt of the moſt holy, Orthodox learnedeſt Councells Biſhops, Clergy-men, and with the generall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, and deſire of the beſt and moſt Zealous Chriſtians, (with very good ſucceſſe to the publike tranquility, peace of the Church, and preſervation of the Chriſtian faith in purity) have by their Lawes and ſanctions puniſhed with corporall, or Capitall puniſhments in all, or moſt Ages and Realmes where there were any Chriſtian Emperors, Kings, States, Magiſtrates, all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Chriſtian Princes, Magiſtrates, Republikes may with ſafe conſciences and good ſucceſſe puniſh' yea cenſure now, and ought to do it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:64093:40"/>But the moſt pious, zealous &amp; devouteſt Emperors, Kings, States, Magiſtrates, at the prayer and earneſt requeſt of the moſt holy, Orthodox, learnedeſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells, Biſhops, Clergy-men, and with the generall approbation, deſire of the beſt and moſt zealous Chriſtians, (with very good ſucceſſe to the ſettlement of the peace of the Church, and preſervation of the Chriſtian faith in purity,) have by ſevere Lawes and ſanctions puniſhed Hereticks, Apoſtates, ſeducing falſe Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, Blaſphemers, and obſtinate dangerous Sciſmatiks, with corporall or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitall puniſhments, in all or moſt Ages, Realmes, States where there were any Chriſtian Emperors, Kings, States, Magiſtrates, as the premiſes manifeſt.</p>
            <p>Therefore Chriſtian Princes, Magiſtrates, Republikes may doubtleſſe with ſafe conſcience and like good ſucceſſe, puniſh them in like manner now; yea, and ought to do it, unleſſe they will be reputed leſſe pious, zealous or devout then they, or leſſe carefull of the publike peace and peoples ſoules then they have bin.</p>
            <p>And thus much for the affirmative part. I now come to Anſwer the chiefe Objections lately made in Preſſe or Palpit to the contrary, eſpecially Mr. <hi>Dels,</hi> which are freſheſt in memory, and much relied on by his <hi>Independent</hi> party.</p>

            <p>The Objections made to the contrary by our <hi>Oppoſite diſſenting Brethren, Libertins, Sectaries, Anabaptiſts,</hi> are deduced partly from Scripture, partly from reaſon. Some of thoſe from Scripture I have already anſwered in the premiſes, as they lay in my way.

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:64093:41"/>
properly deduced from this Parable is this. God will not make a totall ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of al wicked men from the good, of all Tares and Children of the Devill, from the VVheat and children of the Kingdome in this world; nor ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther together all the wicked, and caſt them into a Furnace of fire, where ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of Teeth, till the end of the World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ergo,</hi> Chriſtian Princes and Magiſtrates muſt tolerate all Hereticks, Sciſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, falſe Teachers, Apoſtates, Idolaters, and execrable Blaſphemers in the Church, and not puniſh, extirpate, burne or cut them downe with the ſword of Iuſtice, till the generall day of Iudgement at the end of the World.</p>

            <p>3ly. If your ſeparation from our churches, becauſe there are Tares grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in them with the VVheat, and your caſting out from your ſeparate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>uch as you deeme <hi>Tares</hi> and <hi>Gotes,</hi> be juſtifiable, then the civill Majeſtrate may and muſt, by the ſame reaſon, puniſh, baniſh, root, &amp; caſt ſuch out of their chriſtian Republiks; there being no ground why the Majeſtrate ſhould admit ſuch to grow together with the wheat in the field of the <hi>chriſtian State</hi> or church, when as the <hi>Eccleſiaſticall Officers</hi> ought not to ſuffer them in their particular churches; ſo as this Parable contradicts your owne practiſe of ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and this your objection from it, againſt the civill Magiſtrates power.</p>
            <p>2ly. To anſwer more particularly: the Objectors may with better proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility ague hence, that Husbandmen muſt not weed their corne nor pluck up the Tares that grow together with it before the Harveſt corne (which would be ſtrang new-light, new doctrine to all good Husbandmen living in the country,) becauſe this Husbandman bid his Servants here, let the Tares alone till the Harveſt, leaſt they ſhould pluck up the wheat together with them; as conclude hence, that Hereticks, Schiſmaticks, Idolaters, Blaſphemers and the like, are to be tollerated, and not puniſhed, nor rooted out by the civill Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, but let to grow untill the end of the world when the generall Harveſt comes. Firſt, becauſe the Tares here ſpoken off, are all ſorts of wicked men whatſoever, and all Children of the Devill living in the world collectively con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered;
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:64093:42"/>
not ſuch or ſuch particular peſtilent Heretickes, Schiſmaticks, falſe Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, Apoſtates, or Blaſphemers, who are more miſchievous and notoriouſly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious then others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo that the argument hence is only this.</p>
            <p>All <hi>Tares</hi> and wicked men ſhall not be rooted out and ſevered from the wheat till the end of the world and the laſt Iudgement.</p>
            <p>Ergo no peſtilent ſeducing Hereticks, Schiſmaticks, falſe-teachers, or exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable Blaſphemers are to be puniſhed and rooted out by the Chriſtian Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates now, but muſt all be left unpuniſhed till then, though they do never ſo much preſent miſchiefe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly the Servants here, that would have gathred up thoſe Tares before the Harveſt, were not the civill Magiſtrates, but rather the Miniſters of the Goſpell, who have no power to root them up with ciuill cenſures, and capitall puniſhments, but only by the word of God: ſo as the Argument hence can be no other then this, if truly propounded. Miniſters of the Goſpell muſt ſuffet the Tares and wheat to grow together till the Harveſt, becauſe they have no power to roote them out by civill puniſhments.</p>
            <p>Ergo Magiſtrates and Chriſtian Princes, who by Gods appointment have the ſword and Sickle of Iuſtice in their hands, muſt alſo ſuffer them to grow untill the Harveſt at the worlds end, and not root any of them out, or cut them downe till then.</p>
            <p>Fourthly there is a double Harveſt and cutting downe of Tares; Firſt, a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Harveſt here; and that is when mens <note n="h" place="margin">Rev. 14. 15 16 Ioel. 3. 13. Gen. 15. 16 Ier. 24. 2, 3, 8, 9. 10 Nah 3. 12</note> 
               <hi>ſinnes are ripe and growne to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity, crying out for the Majeſtrates ſword, and ſickle of Iuſtice to root up and cut them downe.</hi> And in this Harveſt the chriſtian Magiſtrates are, and ought to be the reapers, in cutting them off with corporall and capitall puniſhments. Secondly a generall harveſt at the laſt day, when all the Tares and Reprobates ſhall be cut downe and gathered together, and thrown into hell fire for all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity; and in this harveſt, <note n="i" place="margin">Math. 13. 39. 41. 49. c. 24 31.</note> the <hi>Angells only are the reappers</hi> not the civill Magiſtrates, which harveſt only is here intended: So as the argument hence muſt bee only this.</p>
            <p>God doth not cut downe, gather nor bundle up together, nor caſt into hell fire for all eternity by his Angells, all the Tares and wicked men in the world, till the generall harveſt and judgement day at the worlds end. <hi>Ergo</hi> Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates muſt not cut downe or r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ot out any particular Tares: nor any ſeducing peſtilent Hereticks, Schiſmaticks, Apoſtates, Blaſphemers, Idolaters, Malefactors by corporall puniſhments here in this life.</p>
            <p>Fifthly the reaſon here given for this <hi>letting the Tares alone, leſt whiles ye gather the</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">See Pameli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Annotat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in Epiſt. 52. Cyprian 1. Annot 78. p: 63</note> 
               <hi>tares, yee pull up alſo the wheat with them, intimates,</hi> only thus much to us: That when and where the Tares cannot be weeded out, without rooting up the wheat together with them, there both muſt grow together till the harveſt, otherwiſe not, where the Tares may be rooted out, without rooring<note place="margin">See Calum Mulorat, Bucer and Luther in Locum.</note> up the wheat too. This rule holds good both in Husbandry, policy, and Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Men will not weed their corne when and where they muſt of neceſſity root up all their wheat together with the Tares: yet when and where the weeds may be rooted up, without any hurt to the Corn, there none but very ill Husbandmen will ſuffer them both to grow together till the Harveſt, for feare
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:64093:42"/>

            <p>
               <hi>Theudas</hi> the falſe Prophet, who had raiſed four hundred followers, was ſlain by the hand of Juſtice, and al that believed him were ſcattered &amp; brought to nought, by <hi>Fadus</hi> Lieutenant of Judea, and his forces.</p>

            <p>Nototious Traitors, Rebels, Falſe Prophets, who riſe up in armes ſeditiouſly againſt Authority, are ſure to periſh, &amp; all that obey them ſhall be ſlain or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed by their Princes forces at the laſt, as <hi>Iudas</hi> and his confederates were.</p>

               <hi>Ergo,</hi> Rebels, Murderers, as well as Hereticks, Schiſmaticks, and Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, muſt be let alone and not ſuppreſſed, puniſhed with corporall or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitall puniſhments; or if they be, it will gather them together, and multiply them ordinarily, not diſperſe and bring them to nought.</p>
            <p>This is <hi>Gamaliels,</hi> Mr. <hi>Goodwins</hi> and Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> new myſterious Logick and Divinity, from this inſtance, and example in this text.</p>
            <p>Thirdly I anſwer, that <hi>Gamaliels</hi> concluſion, And now I ſay unto you, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear theſe men and let them alone: as it is no neceſſary conſequence from the premiſed inſtances, ſo the reaſons whereon it is grounded, will no wayes war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant the oppoſite concluſion from it.

Will any man be ſo fooliſh, as not to put out a fire which may endanger his whole houſe, or an whole City, becauſe peradventure it will at laſt go out of it ſelfe, when the whole houſe or City is conſumed? Doubtleſſe no. <hi>Gamaliels</hi> atgument there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and our oppoſers from his reaſon, is neither agreeable to the rules of Divinity or Policy, as theſe inſtances manifeſt, and right reaſon to. For though Hereſies, Blaſphemies, Falſe-teachers, Schiſmaticks, and the like, will at laſt come to nought of themſelves, yet this is no argument at all to forbear and let them alone. Firſt, becauſe it may be very long before they will come to nought of themſelves if let alone: whereas the Magiſtrate by his cenſures will ſpeedily ſuppreſſe them. Secondly, becauſe they may ſpread very far, doe much hurt, and ſeduce divers, if let alone; but not ſo, if ſpeedily ſuppreſſed, and ſeverely puniſhed by the Magiſtrates, as ſoon as broached and diſcovered.

His ſecond reaſon is not much better then it, if ſeriouſly conſidered, as applied to knowne Hereticks, falſe-Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, Schiſmaticks, Idolaters, or Blaſphemers, (the ſubjects now inqueſtion) <q>But if it be of God ye cannot overthrow it, leſt happily he be found to fight againſt God.</q> Therefore Magiſtrates muſt forbeare to puniſh Idolaters, Hereticks, falſe Teachers, obſtinate Schiſmaticks and Blaſphemers, who for certain are not of God, but fighters againſt him, and let them alone, (only upon this ground,) is a ſtrange <hi>Nonſequitur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:64093:45"/>Indeed where Magiſtrates are certainly perſwaded in their conſciences that any Doctrine, way or counſell is of God himſelfe, or have ſufficient grounds to incline their conſciences to beleive that ſuch perſons, Doctrines, wayes are, or moſt probably may be of God, there it is ſafeſt to forbeare the oppreſſion or ſuppreſſion of them, if it may ſtand with publike peace and ſafety; and this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe will warrant as much: But when there is no ſuch certaine or faire proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, but a cleare conviction, that ſuch Perſons, Doctrines, wayes, Schiſmes are not of God, but againſt him; then this advice, and reaſon of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> holds not in the leaſt proportion; but in ſuch caſes the Temporall Magiſtrate ought to proceed to corporall, and in ſome caſes, to capitall puniſhments.</p>
            <p>And this I ſhall cleare from the Text it ſelfe beyond contradiction: This <hi>Councell,</hi> whereof <hi>Gamaliel</hi> was a Member, being <hi>cut to the heart with</hi> Peters <hi>Speech, tooke Counſell to ſlay the Apoſtles,</hi> as obſtinate Hereticks and Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks. <hi>Gamaliel</hi> doubting, and not being reſolved that they were ſuch, diſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them from it upon this ground, becauſe <hi>their way and Counſell</hi> (in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the <hi>extraordinary miracles</hi> they had wrought and other particulars in the foregoing Chapter) <hi>might very probably be of God, and then they could not overthrow it,</hi> and if they oppoſed <hi>it, might hapily be found to be fighters againſt God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> whereas if he had deemed them abſolute Hereticks, Schiſmaticks, and had not heard or ſeene their extraordinaty Miracles, he would have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily conſented with the reſt <hi>to put them to death;</hi> and not adviſed them, <hi>to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraine from them and let them alone.</hi> Therefore the application of this adviſe to undoubted <hi>Hereticks, Idolaters, falſe-Teachers, Schiſmaticks, and Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers</hi> (who never wrought ſuch <hi>extraordinary Miracles,</hi> as <hi>Gamaliel</hi> and the Counſell ſaw and knew the Apoſtles did:) is neither conſonant to <hi>Gama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liels</hi> reaſon nor adviſe.</p>
            <p>Finally, it is obſervable, that though upon <hi>Gamaliels</hi> adviſe the Councell ſpared the Apoſtles lives, and ſet them free; yet they left them not altogether alone, or unpuniſhed. For firſt, they did publikly beat them, v. 40. a corporal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. 2ly. They laid a ſtrict command upon them, that they ſhould not [after that] <hi>ſpeake in the name of Ieſus,</hi> v. 40. Therefore there is direct warrant from this very Text, to reſtraine ſuch as we repute Herericks, and falſe Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers from preaching and private meetings, and to puniſh them with corporall puniſhments, though we doubt and conceive that <hi>hapily they may be right in ſome things.</hi> Wherefore, this Text is ſo farre from ayding, that it ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly refutes and confounds the Objectors.</p>

Mr. <hi>Dell</hi> intimates that chriſtian Princes, States, Magiſtrates are the <hi>Wolves, Leopards, Lyons, Beares, Aſpes, and Cockatrices</hi> meant in the Text; let him then ſpeake it out plainly, and prove it from the Text, which no wayes warrants ſuch an <hi>Anabaptisticall</hi> or <hi>Anarchicall</hi> Interpretation, both ſcandalous and destructive to christian Magistracy, and directly contrary to Iſay 49. 23. <hi>And Kings ſhall he thy nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Fathers, and Queenes thy nurſing Mothers.</hi> But if it be intended only of perſecuting <hi>Sauls</hi> converted into <hi>Pauls;</hi> of men of <hi>Wolviſh, aſpiſh, cruell &amp; ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venous diſpoſitions,</hi> like to theſe deſtructive or poyſonous creatures, conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and quite transformed from their naturall diſpoſitions by the power of Chriſt, and of the great peace and amity that ſhall be betweene all ſorts of men of contrary humours and tempers, (when converted and brought <hi>into Chriſts holy Mountaine,</hi>) as all Expoſitors generally accord; then it is nothing to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and miſerably perverted by Mr. <hi>Dell,</hi> the forme of whoſe argument muſt then be this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Men who before their converſion were as contrary to Chriſts</hi> Sheepe, Lambes Oxen <hi>and</hi> little Children, <hi>as the</hi> Wolfe <hi>is to the</hi> Lambe, <hi>the</hi> Leopard <hi>to the</hi> Kid, <hi>the</hi> young Lyon <hi>to the</hi> Calfe, <hi>the</hi> Beare <hi>to the</hi> Cow, <hi>the</hi> Lyon <hi>to the</hi> Ox, <hi>the</hi> Aſpe <hi>and</hi> Cockatrice <hi>to the</hi> little Child <hi>that playes upon its hole ſhall after their converſion lye downe, feed, and converſe together without hurting or deſtroying one another, and live in a bleſſed ſweet peace and unity together under the Goſpell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ergo, <hi>Chriſtian Princes, States, Magiſtrates under the Goſpell, muſt not reſtraine, impriſon, baniſh, hurt, deſtroy, nor put to death notorious Hereticks, Seducers, Blaſphemers, Sciſmaticks, Apoſtates, as bad as Wolves, Aſpes, &amp;c.</hi>

               <hi>here put in contradiſtinction to them:</hi> Ergo Chriſtian Magiſtrates muſt not hurt, baniſh or deſtroy damnable obſtinate He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, Seducers, Blaſphemers, Schiſmaticks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is as ſtrange an inconſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent as the former; yet this is all Mr. <hi>Dell</hi> can truly inferre from the genuine meaning of theſe words.

            <p>Finally, if this text be meant of the times of the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> and of that <hi>ſweet, peace and amity</hi> that ſhall be between all converted members of Chriſts King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome<note place="margin">* See Cyprian de unitate Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiae.</note> one towards another, that they ſhall all <hi>feed, eat, and lye downe together one with another, and not hurt nor deſtroy in all Gods Holy Mountaine:</hi> then how comes it to paſſe, that the Objector and thoſe he frequently ſtiles, <hi>the faithfull, the Spirituall people, the Saints, the Anoynted ones,</hi> &amp;c. doe not come to this <hi>Mountaine,</hi> the Church, but ſeparate themſelves from our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, and will not lye downe, feed, play, eat nor pray together with thoſe they deeme <hi>Wolves, Lyons, Leopards, Aſpes and Cockatrices,</hi> contrary to this prophecy, to the great disturbance of Chriſts Kingdome? yea why do they all generally betake themſelves to the <hi>Warres,</hi> to <hi>kill, hurt, and deſtroy in all the holy Mountaine?</hi> contrary to the very letter of this Text, and Iſay 2. 3. 4. parallell with it. <hi>Nation ſhall not lift up ſword againſt Nation, neither ſhall they learne Warre any more, &amp;c.</hi> Let him therefore give over preſſing this Text any further, contrary to its ſcope, or if he will have it really verified, let him now retract his Petition to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> to ſuffer <note n="r" place="margin">Right Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, p. 28. &amp; Epiſtle Dedicatory.</note>

            <p>As for the Second quotation, Iſay 60. 18 <hi>Violence ſhall no more be heard in thee, &amp;c.</hi> I anſwer, it is meant of the Church <hi>Triumphant,</hi> not <hi>Militant;</hi> as is cleare by the three next verſes, compared with Rev. 21. and 22. parallell to this Chapter, Iob. 3. 17. 18. 19. and Rev-14. 13.

No wonder then if Chriſt made no uſe of their power. But ſince that, many of them have been and yet are truly Chriſtian and religious; as ſome <hi>Kings of Iudah and Magiſtrates</hi>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:64093:47"/>
were truly pious before Chriſts time: Therefore he may well make uſe of their power now (being for and from him) though he did not whiles he was on earth; as he made uſe of <hi>Moſes; Ioſhua, David, Solomon, Hezekiah, Nehemiah, Cyrus,</hi> with others heretofore: yea of <hi>Nebuchadnezars power</hi> to make lawes to puniſh <hi>blaſphemy,</hi> after his converſion Dan. 3. 29. who former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>enacted lawes and</hi> puniſhments to enforce <hi>the adoration of his golden Idol,</hi> and caſt <hi>Shadrach, Meſhach,</hi> and <hi>Abednego, into the fiery furnace, for tranſgreſsing them,</hi> though afterwards he promoted them for their conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and ſufferings in Gods cauſe. Fourthly, Chriſt whiles he was on earth, did notmake uſe of the books of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> nor of the <hi>gift of tongues</hi> to convert men. I hope Mr. <hi>Del</hi> dare not thence maintaine. <hi>Ergo,</hi> we ought not to make uſe of theſe books now for this purpoſe, as ſome of our <note n="*" place="margin">See Mr. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graenaes, and Mr. Baillier Anabaptiſme ch. 1. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3. 4.</note> Sectaries now and <hi>Anabaptiſts heretofore have taught.</hi> Fifthly, Chriſts main work on earth <hi>was, to preach the Goſpel as a Miniſter,</hi> Luke 4. 18, 19, 20. 43. Mark 1. 14 c. 8. 1. not to puniſh Malefactors as a Judge or Magiſtrate. To argue then as Mr. <hi>Dell</hi> doth; Chriſt did not uſe the power of the World, or Magiſtrate, as he was a <hi>Preacher,</hi> but of the Word alone. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Magiſtrates under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel have no power to puniſh Hereticks, Schiſmaticks, Blaſphemers, and ſuch like Malefactors; is rather to ſpeak <hi>Nonſenſe</hi> then <hi>Reaſon</hi> or <hi>Divinity.</hi> And ſo much for his firſt Argument.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is this: <hi>Chriſt commanded not his Diſciples to uſe any ſuch out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
               <note place="margin">Object. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </note> 
               <hi>power, but commanded them to preach: Ergo, they may not goe to the ſecular Magiſtrate, to ask power to puniſh, impriſon, or ſell the goods of Hereticks, Blaſphemers, Seducers, and obſtinate Schiſmaticks;</hi> neither may Chriſtian Magiſtrates puniſh ſuch with corporall or capitall puniſhments.</p>
            <p>I anſwer firſt, that Chriſt ſent his Apoſcles only [<note n="y" place="margin">Math. 10. &amp; 28. 19. 20. Mar. 16 15. 16. 17. 1 Cor. 1. 17.</note>] to <hi>baptize and preach</hi>
               <note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> 
               <hi>the Goſpel, as Apoſtles;</hi> not to puniſh. Malefactors, as Magiſtrates. Therefore the Argument is meerly Independent. Secondly, the Magiſtrates then were <hi>Iewiſh and Heatheniſh,</hi> not <hi>Chriſtian;</hi> [<note n="z" place="margin">Acts 4 25. 26. 27. 28. 29. c. 5. throughout c. 9. 1. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> c. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> 2. 1. 2. 3.</note>] <hi>againſt Chriſt and Religion</hi> not for them. And to argue thus: The Apoſtles prayed not aide from <hi>Iewiſh</hi> or <hi>Heathen Magiſtrates</hi> againſt Hereticks, falſe Teachers, Schiſmaticks, Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, or any other Malefactors: <hi>Ergo,</hi> Miniſters, and good Chriſtians, may not pray in aide from Chriſtian Kings and Magiſtrates againſt ſuch; nor have they right to inflict corporall or capitall cenſures on them, <hi>ex officio;</hi> is a moſt independent inference. Thirdly, the Apoſtles had ſuch a power in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Chriſtian Magiſtrates, that they miraculouſly by the power of Chriſt, puniſhed <hi>Ananias and Saphyra with ſudden death,</hi> for lying <hi>unto the Holy Ghoſt, and tempting God, Acts</hi> 5. 1. to 12. Yea, <hi>Paul ſtruck Elymas the Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerer (when he would have perverted the ſtrait wayes of God, and hindred Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius Paulus the Deputy his converſion, ſeeking to turn him from the faith,) with ſudden blindneſſe, that he could not ſee the Sunne; whereupon, the Deputy when he ſaw what was done, believed.</hi> Therefore Miniſters may in an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary way make uſe of the power of Chriſtian Magiſtrates to puniſh or cut off Hereticks, Seducers, and Blaſphemers againſt the Holy Ghoſt. Or if not, yet Magiſtrates, <hi>ex officio</hi> are bound to do it, without their intreaty. Fourthly, <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, though an Apoſtle, <hi>Rom,</hi> 13. 3, 4. and <hi>Peter</hi> too, in the 1. <hi>Peter.</hi>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:64093:48"/>
2. 13, 14. pray in <hi>aide from Kings and the higher civill powers for the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of evill doers,</hi> as being <hi>Gods Miniſters and revengers, to execute wrath upon them that are evill,</hi> as well under the Goſpel as Law: and S. <hi>Iohn</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes us, that <hi>the ten hornes</hi> (<hi>who are ten Kings</hi>) <hi>ſhall make the Whore</hi> (<hi>of Babylon</hi>) <hi>deſolate and naked, and eate her fleſh, and burne her with fire,</hi> Revel. 17. 16.

            <p>His third Argument is this, [<note n="c" place="margin">Right Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. p. 25</note>] <hi>Is it not miſery enough for men to refuſe the good things of heaven, except they alſo deprive them of the good things of this preſent life?</hi> If there be any Logick or Divinity in this rhetoricall argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, it is but formally this.</p>
            <p>
               <q>It is miſery enough to <hi>wicked men</hi> (his words are generall, and extend to all <hi>wicked men</hi> of all ſorts, not Hereticks only) that they refuſe the good things of Heaven and Eternall Life. Therefore the Magiſtrate ought not to deprive any wicked man whatſoever of the good things of this life, nor to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict upon him temporall death.</q>

            <p>I anſwer, that if this Argument be ſolid, then the Magiſtrate muſt puniſh<note place="margin">Anſvver.</note> no <hi>wicked men</hi> for any offence whatſoever againſt God or man, no not for <hi>Atheiſme, Treaſon, Rebellion, Murther, Sodomy,</hi> and the fowleſt crimes; becauſe the loſſe of the good things of heaven and eternall life, is a ſufficient puniſhment for them, as well as for Hereticks, Schiſmaticks, and Blaſphemers: And then how wil it ſtand with his own conceſſion (I fear not from the heart, ſince the whole ſcope of his Arguments contradict it) p. 27. <hi>As for thoſe that are outwardly wicked</hi> (as open profeſſed Hereticks, Schiſmaticks, and Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers are) <hi>the Magiſtrate is to keep them in order for the quiet of the State he having power over their perſons, eſtates,</hi> LIVES.

            <p>Secondly, God himſelf, the Fountaine and Rule of juſtice, doth many times puniſh wicked men, who refuſe the good things of Heaven and eternall life, with the loſſe of the good things of this life, &amp; infliction of temporal and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall death to boot; witneſſe <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. 15. to 68. <hi>Levit.</hi> 26. 14. to 44. and <hi>Rev.</hi> 18, 19, inſtead of many other texts.

            <p>Fourthly, there is no inhibition to Magiſtrates in any of theſe texts, not to puniſh obſtinate Hereticks with impriſonment, fines, death, and expreſſe war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to do it in others. Therefore this objection is a meer abſurdity.</p>

Premiſes on which it is grounded?

Hence the Rhemiſts in their Annotations on the <hi>New-Teſtament,</hi> have this Note on this very text. <hi>Notjuſtice, nor al rigorous puniſhment of ſinners is here forbidden, nor Elias fact reprehended, nor the Church, nor Chriſtian Princes blamed,</hi> FOR PVTTING<note place="margin">NOTE.</note> HERETICKS TO DEATH; <hi>but that none of theſe ſhould be done for deſire of particular revenge, or without diſcretion or regard of their amendment, or example to others: Therefore</hi> Saint <hi>Peter uſed his power upon</hi> Ananias <hi>and</hi> Saphyra, <hi>when he ſtruck them even to death, for defrauding the Church:</hi> which Doctor <hi>Fulke</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi> both approve, and reply not thereto. 3ly. If the objected words of our Saviour, bee rightly qualified in his owne ſence (farre different from that Mr. <hi>Dell</hi> would thruſt upon them) the abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of the Argument will more viſibly appeare. To cleare therefore their true meaning, I ſhall compare them with a like ſpeech of his, Iohn 12. 47. <hi>For I came not to judge the world, but to ſave the world:</hi> and Math. 18. 11. Luke 9. 10. <hi>For the Son of man is come to ſeek and to ſave that which was loſt:</hi> From whence it is evident: Firſt, that theſe words of Chriſt were principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meant, <hi>of deſtroying and ſaving mens lives, in a ſpirituall,</hi> not <hi>Naturall</hi> ſence; and that for all eternity: For, to make the end of Chriſts comming on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſave mens lives from temporall deſtruction, and preſerve men from tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall death by the hand of humane Juſtice, eſpecially when they offend, (as Mr. <hi>Dell</hi> interprets it) is infinitely to derogate from the prime end of his comming; the rather, becauſe Chriſt <hi>ſaved only a few diſeaſed perſons lives,</hi> (not any Malefactors, no not the penitent Theefes crucified with him) from temporall death, but ſaved all his Elect from eternall death and deſtruction. 2ly. They muſt be thus underſtood, that the <hi>principall end</hi> of Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, <hi>was not to deſtroy mens lives</hi> with temporall or ſpirituall deſtruction, but to <hi>ſave them:</hi> or at leaſt, not to deſtroy them without juſt grounds: or, not in any extraordinary manner, <hi>with fire from Heaven,</hi> or upon ſo ſlight an occaſion as the Apoſtles would have him here: but not his only end; For <hi>Chriſt</hi> hhmſelfe <hi>is a Rock of offence, a ſtumbling blocke, yea a ſavour of death unto death, unto many, and will grind ſome unto pouder.</hi> 1.

            <p>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:64093:54"/>To this I anſwere. 1. that though the word and Miniſtry of it, be the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall meanes of converting, reforming and convincing Hereticks, Blaſphem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Errors, Schiſmes, as is objected; yet it no wayes juſtles out or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyes the coercive power, the corporall and capitall puniſhments of the Chriſtian Magiſtrate for ſuppreſſing Hereſies, Errors, Schiſmes, Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and puniſhing thoſe who are guilty of them under the Goſpel, no more then it did their ſuppreſſing and puniſhing of <hi>Idolatry</hi> and <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> under the Law with temporall death and cenſures, as I have formerly proved. To make this apparent, I ſhall lay down theſe Poſitions.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that the greateſt part of ſuch who profeſſe themſelves Chriſtians, and converted to the outward imbracing and profeſſion of the Goſpel, are yet not really nor inwardly converted to the ſaving obedience and practiſe of it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that inward imbracing or outward profeſſion of the Goſpel, doth<note place="margin">[<hi>ſ</hi>] Rom. 13. 4. c 16. 17. 18. 2. Pet. 2. 1. 2.

            <p>Thirdly, that obſtinate Hereticks, falſe Teachers, Blaſphemers, Schiſmaticks, are <hi>evill doers;</hi> and Hereſie, Blaſphemy, Errors, Schiſmes, (<note n="*" place="margin">Gal. 5. 19. 20. 21. 2 Pet. 2. 1. &amp;c. Rom. 16. 17. 18.</note>

            <p>Fourthly, that converſion of Infidels and Pagans to chriſtianity, and the reclaiming of Hereticks, Schiſmaticks, Blaſphemers, Idolaters, Sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, or other Malefactors from their evill wayes, is one thing; uſually wrought by one kinde of inſtrument, to wit, the <note n="u" place="margin">Acts 26. 17. 18.

To argue then as the Objectors doe, That the word and Miniſtry of it, are the vſuall and principal meanes appointed by Chriſt inwardly to convert men from Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme, Hereſie, Idolatry, Error, Schiſme, unto the orthodox truth and to inward piety and Sincerity. <hi>Ergo</hi> the Magiſtrate may not puniſh nor ſuppreſſe theſe crimes, ſinnes, to hinder their outward ſpreading, infecting of others, or to prevent or remove Gods judgements, or preſerve the peace of Church, State, is a moſt groſſe <hi>Non ſequitur,</hi> ſince both of them are co-ordinate and conſiſtent together, not juſling out one another.</p>
            <p>2ly.

            <p>3ly. If Chriſt did not ſend out his Apoſtles armed with any <hi>power of ſwords, Gunnes, States or Armies to convert and reforme the world, but did it by the word alone:</hi> then what warrant have any of Mr. <hi>Dells</hi> new <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted Prophets,</hi> or any <note n="*" place="margin">See Mr. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granaes.</note>

Certainly if Mr. <hi>Dells</hi> objection be true, they have in this much tranſgreſſed againſt the Goſpell, and Chriſts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of late, and muſt hence forth ceaſe to be ſuch <hi>Preachers and Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,</hi> or elſe lay downe their Armes before they may or can be ſuch. The ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe <note n="b" place="margin">Page 13. 14.</note> Mr. <hi>Dell</hi> himſelfe tells the Parliament from that ſpeech of <hi>Nathan to David. Thou ſhalt not build an Houſe unto my name, for thou haſt beene a man of Warre, and haſt ſhed much blood, &amp;c.</hi> So I ſay unto you touching this worke of Reformation: <hi>You did well in that it was in your hearts to reforme the Kingdome of God, and the ſpirituall Church, which is Chriſts owne deare body: Nevertheleſſe, <hi>You ſhall not reforme it, for you have beene Mon of Warre;</hi> that is, you have managed a great and mighty Warre, againſt great and mighty Enemies, and have ſhed much blood Therefore you ſhall not do this work having beene men of Warre, <hi>For this is not a worke of Men of Warre,</hi> but of the Prince of Peace</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>If this be the truth of God, and mind of Jeſus Chriſt (as Mr. <hi>Dell</hi> aſſerts it) I hope it will both informe and reforme, <note n="d" place="margin">Epiſtle Dedicatory.</note> our preaching reforming Souldiers, and men of Warre, who have beene formerly peccant againſt this Doctrine, and a <hi>ſpeciall Ordinance of both Houſes,</hi> ſince they have beene actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, but the Parliament only Virtually, engaged in this preſent bloody Warre. And ſo much the rather, becauſe we read in Scripture Luke. 3. 14. <hi>That when the Souldiers came to</hi> Iohn <hi>the Baptiſt, and demanded of him, what ſhall wee doe? He ſaid unto them. Do violence to no man, neither accuſe any falſely: and be content with your wages</hi> He bid them not, goe and preach the Goſpell: this was a proper worke for Miniſters, and Apoſtles, not for Swordmen: So Acts 10. 12. We read of <hi>Cornelius a Centurion of the Italian band, a devout man, and one that feared God with all his houſe, that he gave much Almes to
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:64093:55"/>
the people, and prayed to God alwayes;</hi> but yet we never finde that he pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely preached: yea, he was ſo farre from this, that the <hi>Angell of God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing to him, commanded him to ſend to</hi> Ioppa <hi>and call for</hi> Symon Peter: <hi>and he ſhall tell thee what thou oughteſt to doe:</hi> whereupon <hi>he called two of his Servants and a devout Souldier;</hi> (yet no preacher that we read of, no not in nor to his owne Family, Regiment or Troope,) <hi>and ſent them to</hi> Ioppa <hi>for</hi> Peter: who comming unto his houſe, <hi>he found many that were come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; who were all there preſent before God,</hi> (not to preach <hi>but) to</hi> HEARE <hi>all things that were commanded him of God: Whereupon he opened his mouth and preached to them; and whiles he ſpake the Holy Ghoſt fell upon all them that heard the word, ſo that they ſpake with Tougues and magnified God; whereupon they were all Baptiſed in the name of the Lord.</hi> If theſe devout Souldiers then, were only Auditors, but no preachers in the Apoſtles dayes, it were well thoſe Souldiers, who now pretend to reduce all things to the Modell of thoſe primitive times, would be ſo modeſt and Chriſtianly wiſe, as to imitate <hi>Cornelius</hi> his example, who was as devout, as charitable, as frequent in prayer, and one that feared God with all his houſe as much, as any of our preaching <hi>Ceuturions</hi> or <hi>Souldiers</hi> now; and not uſurpe the Miniſters office, no more then the Magiſtrates or their ſuperior Commanders; which they may doe with as much reaſon; being ſent forth and hired by the Parliament, not to preach the Goſpell, but to fight. However, Gods ſpeech to <hi>David,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dells</hi> ſtrang application of it to the Parliament, muſt no wayes hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Parliament or our Magiſtrates from drawing out the ruſty Sword of Iuſtice againſt all <hi>Hereſies, Errors, Schiſmes, Blaſphemies,</hi> which they are to puniſh, ſuppreſſe, or at leaſt endeavour to reforme by outward puniſhments and coercive Lawes.</p>

Witneſſe Pſal. 119. 67. 71. 75. <hi>Before I was afflicted I went a ſtray; but now have I kept thy word. It is good for me that I have beene afflicted, that I might learne thy Statutes; and in thy faithfullneſſe thou haſt afflicted me.</hi> Gods Rod reformed <hi>David,</hi> when his <hi>word</hi> would not prevaile.

Cor. 11. 32. <hi>when we are chaſtened of the Lord, it is, that we ſhould not be condemned with the world.</hi> Hebr. 12. 5. to 12. <hi>My ſonne deſpiſe not the chaſtiſement of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him: for whom the Lord loveth hee cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſeth, and ſcourgeth every Sonne whom he receiveth.

Thirdly, admit the Octjection true, that they wought no inward reformation at all in the hearts of men, but onely an outward forme of godlineſſe and conformity, in outward duties, or a reſtraint of actuall ſinnes, when the heart is full of Atheiſme, Adultery, Pride, Error, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, (which outward <hi>restraint, reformation, forme of godlineſſe, practice of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward duties,</hi> outward order, conformity, and reformation of externall and groſſe ſinnes, Maſter <hi>Dell</hi> in the objected paſſage, and <note n="p" place="margin">Pag. 7, 8, 9, 39.</note> elſwhere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth it doth work, and tyes up mad <hi>Dogges, Beares</hi> and <hi>Tygars,</hi> &amp;c.) muſt they therefore be caſt aſide as uſeleſſe, and have no uſe at all among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, in reforming them and the Church of God? God forbid; for this very bringing of men to a conſtant outward conformity in the practice of holy duties, and attendance on Gods Ordinances, is a greater honour to God, a greater benefit and credit to a Chriſtian State, and farre better in it ſelfe, then open contempt, or neglect of the outward Ordinances, or profeſſed impiety, atheiſme and prophaneneſſe.

And therefore this Objection, That Chriſtian Princes and Magiſtrates ought not to reſtraine or puniſh Hereticks, Schiſmaticks, &amp;c. or to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle in the outward Reformation of the viſible Churches within their Territories, becauſe they cannot inwardly convert and reforme all mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of them, is a moſt abſurd and ridiculous Objection.

Seventhly, The Magiſtrates and Gods intention in puniſhing and reſtraining Hereticks, Schiſmaticks, Blaſphemers, and other Malefactors, is not to make them Hypocrites, but really to reclaime or make them better at leaſt, if not inwardly to convert them: If<note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>Gregor.</hi> l. 7. epiſt. 40. <hi>Antonius</hi> 2. par.

Eightly, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> hath moſt fully refuted this Objection in a like caſe, Phil. 1. 15, 16, 17, 18. <hi>Some indeed preach Chriſt, even of envy and ſtrife, and ſome alſo of good will: The one preach Chriſt of contention, not ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſuppoſing to adde affliction to my bonds: But the other of love, knowing that I am ſet for the defence of the Goſpel.

Notwithstanding every way, whether in pretencee or truth, Chriſt is preached,</hi> AND I THEREIN DOE RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>JOYCE, YEA, AND WILL REJOYCE: compared with the 1 Cor. 1. 18, 23, 24. <hi>For the preaching of the Croſſe is to them that periſh, fooliſhneſſe; but unto us that are ſaved, it is the power of God, &amp;c.

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:64093:61"/>
glory by it, even in thoſe that periſh, and ſome are converted thereby, though others hardned and damned; ſo, though the Magiſtrates coercive power and puniſhments, inwardly convert not many, yet becauſe they reſtraine moſt Hereticks, Schiſmaticks, Sinners from doing more miſchief to others, and committing more actuall ſinnes in themſelves, yea make an outward conformity and reformation where Juſtice is duely executed, they muſt be ſtill continued, and conſcionably uſed in the Church, though they ſhould make many men Hypocrites, and worſe then they were before, being God's Ordinance for good, not ill. Ninthly, admit the Magiſtrates puniſhments and coercive power ſhould actually convert and reforme none in a Goſpel way of themſelves; yet they compell them to reſort to the Word and Ordinances, and to the uſe of thoſe meanes which God hath ſpecially appointed to convert and reforme them, both in heart and life, yea, the ſuppreſſing of all private meetings and conventicles of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, Schiſmaticks, Anabaptiſts, Papiſts, Blaſphemers (which confirme and ſettle them in their damnable hereſies, errors, ſchiſmes) and conſtraining them to reſort conſcionably to our publick Congregations, where the Word of God is truly preached, expounded, &amp; the Sacraments duely admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred (all former grounds of their Separation and Schiſm fromour Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies being fully removed, ſo as there is nothing but obſtinacy which now makes them ſeparate) would be a ready meanes, through Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, to reduce, reclaime, convert and unite ſuch both to God and us, and put a ſpeedy period to all our deſperate ſchiſmes, occaſioned meerly by the cowardize or negligence of Magiſtrates in not cenſuring, and of the people in not informing againſt, and proſecuting ſuch offenders. With this kind of compulſion, to force men to our publick Ordinances and Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, from which there is no juſt ground of conſcience now to ſeparate, is no forcing of their conſciences, nor compelling them to beleeve, nor proſecuting of men for conſcience (as is maliciouſly objected) no more then a Phyſitians compelling of a Patient to take a bitter Potion againſt his will, to recover his health, and ſave his life; or a Parents conſtraining his Child to goe to Church or Schoole; or a Maſters compelling his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to doe his work, or learne his Trade; or a Commanders enforcing his Souldiers to fight againſt their wils; or the putting of a lame perſon into a Bath againſt his mind to recover his limbs; and hath been practiſed in all Ages by the moſt religious Princes; being warranted by Gods owne dealing <hi>with us in our converſion unto him; who</hi>

               <hi>Bernard</hi> aſſerts of them, <hi>mori magis eligunt quàm converti:</hi> Therefore this Text and Argument cannot be applied to them; and is but this in ſubſtance:
<q>The Faithfull, (the proper Subjects of Chriſts Kingdome) are a willing people, and ſo need no forcing.</q>
            </p>
            <q>
               <hi>Ergo,</hi> Obſtinate Hereticks, Schiſmaticks, falſe Teachers, Blasphemers (who are neither Gods people, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>He might as well argue; boyes that are willing to goe to Schoole and learne their bookes, need not the rod to force them to it; <hi>Ergo,</hi> boyes that loyter and are unwilling to goe to School or learne their books, need not the rod, and muſt not be whipped. A meer loytering School-boyes argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which deſerves no anſwer but the whip.</p>
            <p>Secondly, no Church nor Congregation in the World conſiſteth
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:64093:67"/>
only or altogether of Saints &amp; willing people, but the major part of them at leaſt, are unregenerate, backward and unwilling to all that is good; yea need upon occaſion, by Lawes and outward puniſhments, to be conſtrained to reſort to the pnblick Ordinances, and to forſake their errors, ſchiſmes: To argue therefore againſt the coercive power of the Magiſtrate in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Churches, States, becauſe the Saints are a willing people, when as the moſt in the Church are neither Saints nor willing, and ſo need coercive Lawes and puniſhments, is moſt abſurd; Yet this is Maſter <hi>Dels</hi> Logick and Divinity; He might as well conclude, the Saints are a willing people, <hi>Ergo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> the Magiſtrate cannot puniſh Traytors, Murderers, Theeves, Rebels, as; <hi>Ergo,</hi> they muſt not puniſh Hereticks, Schiſmaticks, Blaſphemers.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Admit the Saints to be a <hi>willing people,</hi> and that ſome of them may be Hereticks and Schiſmaticks for a time, will it therefore follow, they need no Rods nor Spurs to ſtir them up, reduce or puniſh them, when, or where they are dull, negligent, erronious, or doe amiſſe? Will you ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue thus? Chriſts Saints and People are a willing People: <hi>Ergo,</hi> they need not the exhortations, preaching, or inſtructions of Miniſters, of private Chriſtians, the exerciſe of holy duties, the threats and terrors of the Law or Goſpel, to excite and ſtirre them up. Doe not the willingeſt Chriſtians, Saints, need <hi>Rods, Spurs</hi> ſometimes, as well as others, to quicken them? and doth not God himſelfe many times ſcourge, excite them with out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and inward afflictions and chaſtiſements of all ſorts, to make them mend their pace? Did Maſter <hi>Dell,</hi> or his Saints in the Army, never ſpu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>re nor whip their <hi>free Horſes?</hi> or doe Schoolmaſters never whip or ferrula their Schollars that are moſt forwards to learne, becauſe they are <hi>willing Boyes?</hi> No verily: Their willingneſſe at one time, will not excuſe their deadneſſe, dulneſſe, lazineſſe, much leſſe their <hi>deviations</hi> at another: Therefore though people be willing, yet they need the Spurs, the Rods both of the Miniſter and Magiſtrate to quicken, or mend their ſpeed, and reclaime them when they erre, <hi>&amp; ubi deſinit Theologus ibi incipit Magistratus,</hi> where the Miniſtry of the Word will not quicken and reforme Chriſtians, the Magiſtrates Sword muſt doe it: Chriſts Power muſt make men willing when his Mercy and Goſpel will not prevaile; and Magiſtrates Lawes duly executed muſt bring Hereticks, Schiſmaticks, Blaſphemers to confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and our publick Congregations, when the Word will not effect it: And thus much for his Argument.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, for his Authorities cited, <hi>That Faith is not to be forced, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded by the Word;</hi> I grant it true in the Authors ſence, but not in <hi>Maſter Dels<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:64093:68"/>
after the death of <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate, by the unanimous conſent of all the Captaines, Souldiers and People, he abſolutely refuſed the Empire, ſaying, <note n="*" place="margin">Tripart. Hiſt l. 7. c. 1.</note> 
               <hi>That he being a Christian would not be an Emperour over Infidels:</hi> But all were ſo well pleaſed with his election, that they preſently cryed out, <hi>We are Christians,</hi> and for his ſake thoſe who were not ſo before, <hi>reſolved to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Christians, upon condition he would accept the Empire; which thereupon he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted: Whereupon they all turned Christians, and were by this meanes converted to the Christian Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, I anſwer, that the Chriſtian Magiſtrates may indirectly force men to beleeve in ſome ſenſe, though not directly: As firſt, they may enforce them to the outward Ordinances and meanes of Faith, even againſt their wils (as Parents ſometime enforce their children, and Maſters their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants) which by Gods bleſſing may work a right faith and beliefe in them by degrees, and convert them from their errors: Forced Phyſick and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions oft timea recover ſick men; and ſo doe forced Ordinances and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, hereticall, erronious, ſinfull men, as experience manifeſts. Secondly, they may puniſh them for their obſtinate hereſies, ſchiſmes, blaſphemies, and thereby bring them to a ſerious examination, reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and diſcovery of them, and ſo to a kind of forcible embracing of the Truth, as <hi>Chriſt in a manner thus enforced</hi> Paul <hi>by outward violence, to give over his perſecution, and beleeve, profeſſe the Goſpel,</hi> Acts 9. Thirdly, tempeſts at Sea, enforce Mariners and Merchants to be willing to caſt all their Goods over-board, to ſave their lives; ſo may Magiſtrates penalties enforce Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, Schiſmaticks, Blaſphemers to caſt away their errors, hereſies, ſchiſms, Blaſphemies, and imbrace the Truth, to ſave their lives, liberties or eſtates, Fourthly, an erronious judgment and conſcience in matters of Religion, is not a Chriſtians rule of faith or practice, but the word of God, the rule both of his judgment, Conſcience, faith, life: and it is a <note n="*" place="margin">See Maſter <hi>Rutherfurds</hi> Due Right of Presbyteries, p. 378, &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> dangerous, yea, damnable ſin, for any to be led by ſuch a conſcience or judgment contrary to the word: If then a Chriſtian Magiſtrate be fully perſwaded in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience upon juſt grounds, that he is bound to reſtraine and puniſh ſuch He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retickes, Schiſmatickes, Blaſphemers, who follow their owne erroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous judgments and conſciences againſt the expreſſe word of God, even to force them from their hereſies, errors, ſchiſmes, blaſphemies, when no other meanes will prevaile, he may no doubt inflict corporall puniſhments on them (as God himſelfe oft times inflicts outward judgments) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to enforce them to renounce their Hereſies and embrace the Truth. And in this ſence, Religion may lawfully be forced, as will appeare by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of <hi>Manaſſeh, Nebuchadnezzer,</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> forecited; and by <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. 11. <hi>Jude.</hi> 23. God himſelfe appointing this externall violence, as a meanes to work an inward change both of faith and life, as I have largely proved.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, there is an affirmative and a negative beliefe: Though the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate cannot enforce men by externall puniſhments or cenſures to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve; yet he may enforce them to come to the publick Ordinances, whereby they may be allured, converted to the true Faith; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:64093:68"/>
negatively enforce or reſtrain them, nor to preach, nor yet to ſpred or propagate ſuch an hereſie, error, blaſphemy or ſchiſmaticall opinion, contrary to the Scripture, and Religion eſtabliſhed, to the infection of others, the diſturbance of the publick peace, and diſhonour of Chriſtian Religion; yea, puniſh ſuch who ſhall tranſgreſſe, becauſe this is no for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of mens faith, conſciences, to beleeve or embrace what faith the Magiſtrate pleaſeth; but a reſtraining or puniſhing of an hereſie, error, blaſphemy, which is a ſinne in the party who is guilty of it, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhable by the Magiſtrate, and a ſinne in him to connive at, or tolerate the ſame without puniſhment.

Secondly, it is one thing to enforce Jewes to come to the outward Ordinances, and Meanes of converſion, that they may beleeve, or be converted by them; and another thing to enforce them to beleeve and be baptized before in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction or conviction: the firſt this Council condemnes not, but the later onely. Thirdly, there is a difference between compelling Jewes by outward violence to be baptized, and profeſſe themſelves to be Chriſtians; and reſtraining of them by Lawes and puniſhments, not to exerciſe their Jewiſh Ceremonies, or vent their Blaſphemies in contempt of Chriſt, and Chriſtian Religion; the later whereof this very Council reſtraines, <hi>Can.</hi> 58, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="141" facs="tcp:64093:76"/>
Reigne of their moſt Religious Prince King <hi>Syſubet;</hi> and thoſe having once embraced the Goſpel, and received the Sacraments, though by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion, are by like coertion to be enforced to perſervere in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, by the determination of this very Canon: Therefore by the ſelfe ſame reaſon, Hereticks who have once embraced the orthodox Faith, and revolt from it unto damnable Hereſies, are by this Councels reſolution, even by outward force and puniſhments to be compelled to renounce their errours, and perſevere in the orthodox Faith they once embraced, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed; or elſe they may be juſtly puniſhed by the civill Magiſtrate, leaſt Gods name ſhould be blaſphemed, &amp;c. Which is ſo far from making againſt, that it is a direct determination for me, eſpecially if we conſider the many penall, coercive Lawes made againſt the Jewes in <hi>Spaine,</hi> about and ſoon after the time of this very Council, recorded at large by <note n="v" place="margin">

Fiftly, there is a wide difference between naturall borne Subjects, and meer Forraigners or Aliens who are no Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, but Sojourners in a Kingdome, as the Jewes were in <hi>Spaine:</hi> A Prince may compell the one being his Subjects, and living under his Laws, to ſuch things as he cannot in juſtice enforce the other. The King and State of <hi>England</hi> may compell all Engliſh, Scottiſh, Iriſh Subjects to repaire to our publick Aſſemblies, and to ſubmit to that Chuch-government which ſhall be eſtabliſhed by common conſent in Parliament; but they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enforce a Jew, a Turk or Spaniard, who ſojourne here as Factors, to make publick profeſſion of our Religion, and ſubmit to our Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>government; though they may reſtrain their open Idolatry and blaſphemy. All which conſidered, there is nothing in this Canon, nor in any other ancient Council or Father that I have met with, which well underſtood, will any way contradict, but ratifie and confirme my Theſis; the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry aſſertion being maintained onely by the ſchiſmaticall, hereticall <note n="x" place="margin">See <hi>Joan: Malderus,</hi> de Virtutibus Theol. qu. 12. de Haereſi Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic. 3. mem. 1.</note> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiſts, to uphold their faction in poynt of <hi>Theſis,</hi> though directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted by their practiſe, as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> demonſttates, and <hi>Optatus</hi> too, who have largely refuted this their Anti-Magiſtraticall error in their forecited, and ſucceeding Paſſages.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Princes ought not onely to take care about the affaires of the common-wealth, and to be altogether careleſſe of Religion, but even unto Eccleſiaſticall affaires, and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, they ought to extend their Princely care and watchfulneſſe. Firſt, the Prince is the Miniſter of God for our good; but the good of the Subject is not onely civill and temporall, but ſpirituall concerning Religion. Secondly, Even the Heathen did aſcribe unto their Kings a principal care even of Religion: Wherupon the Emperors of</hi> Rome <hi>were ſtiled,</hi> Pontifices Maximi, <hi>the high Prieſts or Prelates: and</hi> Ariſtotle <hi>writeth, lib.</hi> 3. <hi>politic. c.</hi> 10. <hi>that the Lacedemonian Kings had the command of War, and</hi> rei divinae cultum exercuiſſe, <hi>and did exerciſe divine worſhip, unleſſe they were ſuch Sacrifices as were neceſſarily to be done by a Prieſt; that therefore which by a common conſent of Nations was given unto Kings, ought not to be denied unto chriſtian Princes. Thirdly, the care of Religion otherwiſe concerneth the Prince, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then private perſons: theſe onely are to wiſh well unto it, and to accept of it; but the Prince ought to be an Agent, without whoſe power nothing can be effected publickly for the maintainance of Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, it belongeth to the Imperial power to maintain true Religion, and ſee that no confuſed mixture of Religions be admitted, for this is given as a reaſon in the time of the Judges, why ſome followed Idolatry and ſtrange worſhip, becauſe there was no King in Iſrael, but every one did that which was good in his owne eyes,</hi> Judges 17. 4. <hi>if there had been then a King, they ſhould not have been ſuffered every one to follow their owne fanſies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, Christian Princes are by their Lawes and Edicts, to reſtraine all Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, Idolatry, Hereſie, Sacriledge, and ſuch like, becauſe Princes are to be feared for evill works; their office is to reſtrain all evill works whatſoever, ſuch as theſe are; and they are appointed to procure the good of their Subjects, and conſequently to take out of the way all impediments which may hinder their good, ſuch as theſe are: The Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts grant thus much, that the Princes by their Lawes ſhould provide againſt Hereſie,</hi> but they will exclude the Prince from all judgment of Hereſie, which muſt be in their opinion determined only by the Church, &amp;c. Which all our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines and Proteſtant Writers condemning, is a ſtrong evidence to me, that Heretickes are properly triable onely by the Judges at the Common Law, by way of Indictment, not by the Clergy, as their Hereſie is crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and capitall, as well as Romiſh Prieſts and Jeſuits.</p>

                  <item>III. <hi>A Magiſtrate may compell a Heathen Nation to the negative reverence of Chriſt, in an indirect way, and that with the Sword, though he cannot compell to the poſitive worſhipping of him: If a Chriſtian Prince ſubdue a Pagan Nation, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not force them with the Sword to a poſitive receiving of the Doctrine of the Goſpel, but if it be a Nation expreſly blaſpeming Chriſt, as the Nation of the Jewes now doe, he may compell them to an abſtinence from a profeſſed blaſpheming of Chriſt, becauſe he is to uſe the ſword againſt Blaſpemy.</hi>

            <p>Having fully anſwered and totally routed all Maſter <hi>Dels</hi> forces, againſt the coercive power of the civill Chriſtian Magiſtrate, in caſe of Hereſie, Schiſme, Blaſphemy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſhall next fall upon a few Reſerves of ſome of his Saints in the Army, and of their Champion Maſter <hi>John Goodwin,</hi> which I ſhall quickly ſcatter, and then conclude.</p>
            <p>The twelfth Objection, made by ſome Sectaries in the Army, againſt the Magiſtates puniſhment of Blaſphemy, is thus expreſſed in a Letter written by a godly Miniſter, <hi>June</hi> 3. 1646. who was then in the Army. <note n="d" place="margin">Maſter <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> his third part of the Gangraena p. 46.</note> 
               <hi>They would not have the old Military orders, ſet forth by the Earle of</hi> Eſſex, <hi>obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, <hi>That</hi>
               </hi> BLASPEMERS <hi>ſhould be boared through the Tongue.</hi> The<note place="margin">Object. 12.</note> argument that they urged was, <hi>That ſinnes which are directly againſt God, ſhould be puniſhed by God:</hi> Upon <hi>which ground, they hold, that Hereſie, Atheiſme, &amp;c. ſhould not be puniſhed by the Magistrate, becauſe they are ſinnes directly againſt God, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I ſhall anſwer, firſt, that if this ground were true, then God,<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> the Fountaine of Juſtice, being as able to puniſh ſinnes directly againſt himſelfe, as well under the Law as Goſpel, would not have in poſitive tearmes, commanded ſuch who were guilty of open <note n="e" place="margin">Deut. 13. Levit. 24. 11. to 17.</note> Blaſphemy and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, (being ſinnes directly againſt him) <hi>to be ſtoned and put to death without any mercy,</hi> as I have proved he did; and thoſe godly Magiſtrates and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:64093:83"/>
wſto puniſhed Idolaters with death under the Law, had been Murderers and Delinquents: This argument therefore w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> taxeth God himſelfe, and his precepts of direct injuſtice under the Law, muſt be rejected by the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors as blaſphemous: or elſe they muſt make it appeare by Scripture, that though theſe ſinnes under the Law were by Gods owne command to be puniſhed with death by the civill Magiſtrate and people, yet now under the Goſpel he hath reſumed the power of puniſhing them onely to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and deprived Chriſtian Magiſtrates of it, which they can never doe. Secondly, By this reaſon, Magiſtrates muſt not puniſh direct Atheiſts, openly profeſſing there is no God, nor ſuch Hereticks who deny the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, or the Deity of Chriſt and the holy Ghoſt, nor ſuch as deny there is any Heaven or Hell; ſince theſe ſinne directly againſt God himſelfe. O the piety of Maſter <hi>Dels</hi> anointed faithfull Saints! is this their zeale, their piety, their ſanctity? Thirdly, they muſt by this reaſon puniſh no ſinne at all, no not Rebellion, Murder, Treaſon, Sorcery, Adultery, for theſe <hi>ſinnes are</hi>

               <hi>prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion makes them ſinnes,</hi> but ſinnes onely indirectly againſt men, as they are Gods creatures, and beare his image. Fourthly, if this paradox be true, then by the ſelf ſame reaſon, God himſelfe is not to puniſh any ſinne committed imediatly againſt men, as Murder, Adultery, &amp;c. nor may God nor man puniſh ſinnes committed by beaſtly men with Beaſts, becauſe not directly committed againſt God or man, in the Objectors ſenſe; and then what becomes of the truth of <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 4. <hi>Revel.</hi> 21. 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 22. 15. <hi>Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers and Adulterers God will judge, and they ſhall have their Portion in the Lake which burneth with fire and Erimstone:</hi> And of <hi>Levit.</hi> 18. 23. <hi>cap.</hi> 20. 15, 16. <hi>If a man lye with a Beaſt, he ſhall be ſurely put to death, and he ſhall ſlay the Beaſt: And if a woman approach unto any Beaſt, and lye downe thereto, thou ſhalt kill the woman and the Beaſt, they ſhall ſurely be put to death, their blood ſhall be upon them.</hi> Fiftly, the Magiſtrates <note n="g" place="margin">Rom. 13. 4. 1 Pet. 3. 15.</note>

We read, <hi>John</hi> 19. 12. 13. <hi>That when Pontius Pilate would have releaſed our Saviour Chriſt; the Jewes cryed out ſaying; if thou let this man goe, thou art not Ceſars friend; whoſoever maketh himſelfe a King, ſpeaketh againſt Caeſar.

               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:64093:86"/>
upon falſe carnall reaſonings and principles, warranted by no Scripture, to contradict the coercive power of Magiſtrates, warranted by expreſſe Scriptures. Secondly, the propoſition may very well be denied by <hi>A. S.</hi> or any other, without the perill <hi>of his modeſty or reputation</hi> (the utmoſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard he ſhall incurre by the Objectors confeſſion) I am certaine without any danger to his ſoule or conſcience; elſe we muſt deny the very office and exerciſe of Kingly, and all other Supreame Civill or Eccleſiaſticall powers (here ſecretly ſtruck at) becauſe in the abuſed exerciſe thereof they uſually tend, not onely to prevent, hinder, ſuppreſſe the growth &amp; encreaſe of the knowledge of God and Jeſus Chriſt in a Church and State, with the reformation of ſuch things in Doctrine or Diſcipline as are unwarrantable therein; yea, commonly degenerate into oppreſſion, tyranny, cruelty and injuſtice to boot, as is evident by <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 2, &amp;c. <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 25, to 30. <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 17, to 29. cap. 24. 9, 10. and the Hiſtories of all Ages: Upon which ground the <note n="m" place="margin">

Thirdly, I anſwer, that the abuſe of any lawfull power or inſtitution, doth not nullifie the power or inſtitution it ſelfe, if divine or neceſſary (as the Magiſtrates is) nor the lawfull exerciſe thereof: therefore this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentall abuſe of the Magiſtrates coercive power (the ſinne and fault of the perſons that manage it onely, not of the power it ſelfe) cannot inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid or nullifie the exerciſe of it, no more then the abuſe of preaching and arguing abrogate their lawfull uſe; nor the common abuſe of eating and drinking, to ſurfeting and drunkenneſſe, or of apparell to pride, make the things themſelves, or the right uſe of them, evill. Fourthly, the aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption is falſe, contrary to expreſſe Scriptures, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. 23. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 1, 2. yea the puniſhment of reall Hereſies, Errors, Schiſmes, Blaſphemies (the onely thing in diſpute) by godly Chriſtian Magiſtrates, can never involve them in the objected danger, and tends onely to prevent the Objectors miſchiefs, and to the remotion, ſuppreſſion of thoſe miſts of Hereſie, Error, Blaſphemy, which would eclipſe the light, the knowledge of God &amp; Jeſus Chriſt in Church, State, and helps to reforme things amiſſe in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Diſcipline, as experience with all Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtories, and the Chronicles of the good Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> manifeſt. Therefore this Objection muſt needs be exploded as moſt falſe and dangerous by all good men. Fiftly, fear of puniſhing Hereticks, Schiſmaticks, falſe Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Blaſphemers, will never retard nor diſcourage any Orthodox Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian from ſearching and enquiring into the Scriptures, after more exact knowledge of the good and perfect will of God, as is falſly alleaged; but rather inſtigate them to ſuch a ſearch: and if any accidently by ſuch fear of puniſhment be deterred from ſuch an enquiry into the Scriptures, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to with-hold the truth in unrighteouſneſſe, it is their owne ſinne, not the Magiſtrates, nor the fault of his coercive power rightly managed, yea no true Saints of God, but onely Hypocrites, and ſuch falſe Saints as the Objectors are, will be deterred from ſearching the Scriptures, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:64093:86"/>
to with hold the truth in unrighteouſneſſe by any humane power whatſoever, as is evident by the example of the Apoſtles, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5. of the three Children and <hi>Daniel, Dan.</hi> 3. &amp; 6. of <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 23, 24. <hi>cap.</hi> 21. 11, 12, 13, 14. and by <hi>Cel.</hi> 1. 27, 28, 29. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10. 32, 33, 34. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 3, 4, 5. This Argument therefore muſt vaniſh into nothing before theſe Scriptures, and ſhame the Author of it.</p>
            <p>The ſeventeenth Objection is of the ſame ſtamp, <note n="n" place="margin">A Reply, &amp;c p. 62.</note> That <hi>power which in</hi>

               <hi>the uſe of it plainly and undoubtedly tends to the gratification of Satan, of carnall and prophane men, is not certainly derived from God: But that power in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to cruſh Hereſies, Schiſmes, &amp;c. which</hi> A. S. <hi>and many others pinned upon the Magistrates ſleeve, is a power of this tendency and importance in the uſe of it:</hi> Ergo, <hi>The latter propoſition ſhines cleere enough with its owne light; firſt, becauſe a very great part of thoſe who are like to ſuffer by it, are men of good conſcience, and men truly fearing God; it not being likely, that ordinarily men of looſe or no conſcience ſhould delight to ſwim againſt the ſtreames either of greatneſſe or plurality in matters of Religion: therfore it cannot but be conceived a matter of ſolemn gratification to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, who is a Murderer and bloody Enemy to the Saints, to ſee them diſgraced, cruſhed, &amp;c. Secondly, becauſe it is the impatient and important deſire of all ignorant, looſe, luckewarme and carnall profeſſors, to have all religions (as they call them) all wayes, ſects, opinions and practiſes in Religion, wholly ſilenced, ſuppreſſed and aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed where they live, except only that one way and practice which ſhall be authorized and practiſed by the State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, firſt, that the Minor is both falſe and abſurd: for the uſe of<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> Magiſtrates legiſlative, coercive and punitative power, tends to no ſuch<note place="margin">

               <hi>Blaſphemy, Schiſme, works of the fleſh, directly contrary to the Spirit and Word of God;</hi> it is farre more probable, that the not uſing this power of the Magiſtrate to puniſh them, will farre more gratifie Satan and prophane carnall men, then the exerciſe of it. Thirdly, all the godly Chriſtian Emperours, Kings, States, Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtorians, Councils and Authors forecited, who have enacted Lawes againſt Hereticks, Schiſmaticks, Blaſphemers, and have pleaded for the uſe, neceſſity of this power, have been quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary minded; yea, the very Word and Spirit of God, and God himſelfe (who hath given them ſuch a power in expreſſe tearmes in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and New,) contradict this Anarchicall, if not Atheiſticall propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which hath neither Scripture nor reaſon to back it, but the Objectors own bare aſſertion, point-blank againſt Scripture, and the concurrent ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages of all Ages, Fourthly, I beſeech you obſerve the impudency of theſe Objectors, who deem themſelves the onely Saints, what Blaſphemies they dare to vent in print, <hi>That the Magiſtrates power to cruſh Hereſies, Schiſmes,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:64093:87"/>
Blaſphemies, in the uſe of it, plainly and palpably tends to the gratification of Satan, and carnall and prophane men; and thoſe that are like to ſuffer by it, are men</hi> OF GOOD CONSCIENCE AND TRULY FEARING GOD: <hi>Ergo,</hi> Hereticks, Schiſmaticks and Blaſphemers, in their judgment, are men of good conſcience, truly fearing God; and thoſe godly Chriſtian Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, who out of good conſcience and true feare of God, ſhall reſtraine or puniſh them for their Hereſies, Blaſphemies, Schiſms (by the rule of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries) are men of no conſcience, nor truly fearing God, but <hi>prophane, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall men,</hi> yea <hi>ignorant, looſe, lukewarme and carnall profeſſors,</hi> as he ſtiles them; and none are pleaſed with their puniſhment but Satan, and ſuch men as theſe. This is New-light indeed, deſerving to be hung up at <hi>Tyburne</hi> by the hands of the Hangman, and ſuch abſurd Blaſphemy as becomes none but Tyburne-Saints. Fiftly, I anſwer, that it hath been the importunate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of the true Saints and Miniſters of God in all Ages (not of ignorant, looſe, lukewarme and carnall Profeſſors, as is falſly pretended without proofe or evidence) to have all Religions, Wayes, Sects, Opinions and practiſes in Religion ſuppreſſed, excepting that one true way and practice which the Scripture warrants, and the Chriſtian States wherein they live, upon good grounds approve, as I have plentifully evidenced in the premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and is manifeſt by all Hiſtorians, by the proceedings and Books writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten againſt Hereticks and Schiſmaticks, in all Ages; by the late Petition of thouſands of godly People and Miniſters to the Parliament, and both Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes Anſwers thereunto: Therefore this bare, ſottiſh, falſe aſſertion to the contrary deſerves no other anſwer, but contempt, and the Objectors me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit no other character for it then that of <hi>Titus</hi> 1. 12, 13. <hi>The Cretians are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:64093:87"/>To this I anſwer, firſt, that this Argument is founded meerly upon falſe<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> and carnall reaſon, without and againſt all Scripture, being of the ſame ſtraine as the former. Secondly, the Aſſumption is a groſſe falſhood, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved neither by Scripture, nor Hiſtoricall Examples, nor Experience, but aſſerted onely by the Objectors. Thirdly, it confounds the abuſe of the Magiſtrates coercive power, with the lawfull uſe thereof (as the two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Arguments did) and makes the abuſe to nullifie the uſe. Fourthly, it makes a caſuall contingent effect of the uſe of this coervive power, (which ſeldom happens, &amp; that through the parties own default who is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, puniſhed or onely frighted thereby) to aboliſh the ordinary good uſe and effect thereof, <hi>to wit,</hi> the reall converſion and reformation of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, Schiſmaticks and Blaſphemers (not the pollution of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, a meer contingent not proper effect;) which effect I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at large, it uſually produceth, and was ordained purpoſely to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, by Gods owne inſtitution. Fiftly, the two objected inconveniences ariſing from the uſe of this coercive power, are produced very rarely, and that in few or none; but the contrary effect ordinarily in many; yea, I dare aſſert it, to be a leſſe ſinne to the party puniſhed, farre leſſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour to God, and leſſe miſchiefe to a Chriſtian Church or State, for Hereticks, Schiſmaticks, Blaſphemers to embrace the true Religion and worſhip of God, eſtabliſhed by the State, to repair to, &amp; join w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> our Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies in all publick Ordinances, contrary to the graine of his own ſeduced judgment, erronious inclination, then to perſevere in damnable Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, Schiſmes, Blaſphemies, which his erronious conſcience apprehends to be agreeable to the Truth: Therefore this pretended miſchief, muſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh into ſmoak, and can no wayes impeach the uſe of the Magiſtrates co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercive power. Sixtly, I retort, that the firſt of theſe two pretended effects, not uſually appearing in any one reſtrained Heretick, Schiſmatick or Blaſphemer, is experimentally verified in the higheſt degree in many of the Objectors unreſtrained, unpuniſhed Saints, faithfull and anointed ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall ones, whom they ſo much exalt in a ſuperlative manner, for their tranſcendent holineſſe; their very impunity for three yeers ſpace, hath cauſed God ſo farre to withdraw himſelfe from their formerly tender conſciences, and to leave them ſo farre unto themſelves (as he did the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcellioes among the ancient Donatiſts) that they have many of them by degrees <hi>contracted ſuch a</hi>

Rom. 1. 26, to 31. 1 Cor. 5. 1 Tim. 3. 1. to 7. 2 Pet. 2. and daily experience: will it therefore follow, that Traytors, Murderers, Theeves, Idoloters, Sodomites, and the moſt deteſtable crimes and Malefactors of all ſorts, muſt neither be reſtrained nor puniſhed, eſpecially with death?

IV.
