            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>I Have now by His Majeſties ſpecial Command and Commiſſion for ſome months laſt paſt, reſided in the town of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> All which time I have proceeded in purſuance of the points of my Commiſſion (which were none elſe but the preſervation of this Towne, the County of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and the <hi>Biſhoprick</hi> of <hi>Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and the Liberty of the True Proteſtant Religion, of the Lawes of this Kingdome eſtabliſhed by Parliaments, the Property of the Subjects, Perſons, and Goods, and ſecuring of this Port) with that integrity and tenderneſſe of His Majeſties Honour, who doth paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onately affect the ſafety and Liberty of the Subjects, in all the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars above mentioned: That I have great and juſt occaſion to bleſſe Almighty God for ſo proſpering this his owne, and our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne His Servants worke, in my weak hands. As I am confident I have not yet miſcarried in any one particular, wherein by God and His Majeſtie I have been intruſted. For whereas in moſt of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of this Kingdome, there are nothing to be heard but moſt pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and yet moſt unpittied complaints of the Subjects, for the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible violation of their Churches, and indignities offered to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, unjuſt captivating of their Perſons, exhauſting of their purſes by moſt racking exactions, plundering and pillaging of their Houſes and Goods, againſt the Law of God, and the knowne Lawes of this Land; and all this exerciſed by a party who pretend nothing but the Religion of God, the Law of the Land, and the Liberty of the Subject, (and all this is done under pretence of Parliament po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer.) Yet (bleſſed be God for it) all they who live in theſe parts under my charge, can with one accord teſtifie, that as yet they have not taſted in the leaſt degree any of theſe ſharp outrages, either in their poſſeſſions, Perſons or Goods, from that party in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they had little reaſon to put any truſt, if by my Forces they had not beene kept under: Nor yet can any of that lawleſſe party averre, that by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Forces of mine, or indeed any force at all, they have ſuffered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97840:3"/>
ſuch wicked veaxtions, as they of their owne ſide in all places where they have had power, have uſed towards theſe who have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in Loyalty and Obedience to His Majeſty. And farther, that His Majeſties Port and Haven; hath to his great benefit, and the comfort of all his good Subjects who adhere to him, been ſo ſecured as that now it remaineth as intirely at his Majeſties devotion, as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it did in times of higheſt peace and tranquillity.</p>
            <p>But it hath not pleaſed God, That our Neighbours in <hi>Yorkeſhire,</hi> and the adjacent Counties ſhould enjoy the like calme, which hath moved many of the Prime Noblemen and Gentlemen of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Yorke,</hi> to remonſtrate unto me their ſufferings, which they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure from Sir <hi>John Hotham</hi> his ſon, and many their ſeditious and outragious Complices, and to deſire my ayd for the redreſſing of them, and repreſſing their tumultuous oppreſſions, before they ſhall ſwell to that height, as it cannot ſtand with the ſafety of the Perſons and Eſtates of His Majeſties good Subjects in <hi>Yorkeſhire,</hi> to make any expreſſions of their Loyalty and Allegiance to His Majeſty, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe by ſome of my forces they be ſpeedily comforted and relieved.</p>
            <p>I having ſeriouſly weighed the purport of my Commiſſion, and finding it not only conſiſtent with, and agreeable to the ſame; but knowing well His Majeſties ſacred Intention and conſtant Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſecure the Lives and Liberties of his Subjects by all meanes which he can compaſſe: I have now reſolved to aſſiſt His Majeſties diſtreſſed Subjects in the County of <hi>York</hi> with competent Forces; and yet to leave this Town, and the two other Counties under my Charge, ſo ſtrongly guarded, that their former ſecurity ſhall be no wayes diſcontinued or intercepted.</p>
            <p>And therefore I do by theſe preſents, deſire all his Majeſties Loyall Subjects of the County of <hi>York</hi> to take theſe particulars into their ſerious conſideration, and I expect credit to be given to them.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that I come not into their County by Intruſion, but by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation; and that from thoſe Noblemen and Gentlemen, whom by long experience, they have known to be their ſoundeſt and ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt Patriots, and who have promiſed me in their names a chearfull reception, their utmoſt aſſiſtance, and abſolute obedience to all my Juſt and lawfull Commandements.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I do ſolemnely promiſe, That I come free from the leaſt intention of pillaging and plundering any of his Majeſties good and loyall Subjects, or of exacting any thing from them which ſhall be
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:97840:3"/>
againſt the Priviledges of a free Parliament, the known Lawes of the Land, and Liberty of the Subject.</p>
            <p>And thirdly, That I intend by my Forces to vindicate you from the violent incrochment and oppreſſions made upon you in any of theſe particulars, by thoſe who to their owne lawleſſe ends, abuſe the ſacred name of Parliament.</p>
            <p>And fourthly, That I ſhall (during the time of my abode amongſt you) do nothing of moment, but by the advice and conſultation with thoſe Noblemen and Gentlemen, who have been Solicitors to me in your behalfe; and when it ſhall pleaſe God to give a happy conſummation to thoſe greate buſineſſes for which I intend to come amongſt you, I ſhall retire my ſelfe and forces out of your County, with much more cheerefulneſſe then I conducted them thither.</p>
            <p>And now I deſire to give ſatisfaction both to you of <hi>Yorkeſhire,</hi> and all other true Proteſtants of this Kingdome, why I have been neceſſitated to take under my command and conduct diverſe Popiſh Recuſants in theſe Northern parts.</p>
            <p>Firſt, It was not his Majeſties intention, nor the intention (for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing I know) of any in authority under him, to admitt any of them into this ſervice, if the way had not been chalked out unto His Majeſty, and his Miniſters, by theſe very men; on whoſe Forge this objection was hammered: Let the muſter Roles of that Army which is named from the Parliament be peruſed, and then it ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare plainly, that the mannagers of that Army do exactly and diſtinctly know, that they now have, and for many moneths have had great numbers under their pay, both Engliſh, French and other Nations, whom at the time of their enrolement (and ever ſince) they did know to have been profeſſed Papiſts: whereas by the contrary, it is notoriouſley knowne, that before this courſe was taken by the other party; his Majeſty and his Miniſters did not admit <hi>to,</hi> nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue any Souldiers <hi>in</hi> pay, who were ſuſpected to be that way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined, or did refuſe the oathes of Allegiance and Supremacy; not that His Majeſty thought it unlawfull for him ſo to doe, or that he did not hold his Recuſant Subjects, to be as ſtrongly obliged by the Lawes of this Land for the defence of his Perſon, and the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Parliaments, and Lawes of this Kingdome, as any of his Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Subjects; for if the Kingdome ſtood now under the feare of a Forraigne Invaſion, is it to be conceived, that the Recuſants of this
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97840:4"/>
Land were by the Lawes of the ſame obliged to adventure their Lives and Fortunes in defence thereof? Sure the great confuſion which is now in this Kingdome is of as fearfull a conſequence as any forraine Invaſion poſſibly can be, and therefore the Recuſants are ſo farre from being diſobliged, as they ſtand deeply obliged for giving their aſſiſtance in this time of extremity, if they ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired; But His Majeſty was very cautelous and tender in this point, and certainly would not have looked towards it, if the other Party had not firſt aſſumed that liberty to themſelves, from which by the Law of the Land he ſaw himſelfe no way barred.</p>
            <p>If there be no barre in Law againſt it, then let us examine theſe pretended grand inconveniences, wherewith (as they alledge) it is attended: Sure the wiſeſt Heathen Emperors that ever were, did ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit into their Armies whole Legions of Chriſtian Souldiers, whoſe fidelity they relied much upon, though the Emperours themſelves blaſphemed that God whom thoſe Chriſtian Souldiers adored, Look upon Chriſtian popiſh Emperours; did <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, that wiſe &amp; Warlike Emperour, refuſe the ſervice of any of the proteſtants of Germany in that Army wherewith he made War upon the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants? No, but cheriſhed all ſuch of them as he did conceive to ſtand for the Majeſty and Liberty of the Empire: Looke upon Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Kings and Princes; did <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth the late French King, while he was yet a Proteſtant, reject the aſſiſtance of thoſe many French Papiſts, who ſpent their lives in aſſerting his Crown, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveing their Allegeance to him: Or did bleſſed Queene <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> of moſt pretious memory, upon whoſe ayd and advice that great King did principally rely, go about to perſwade him to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe all his popiſh Subjects out of his Army? and yet it was well known, that She was the greateſt Patron and prop of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion in the whole world. Do our Neighbours of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Provinces reject the auxiliary Regiments under the pay of the French King, becauſe many of them (if not moſt) are Papiſts, ſo long as they are ſecured of their fidelity to them? the point then will not be of their Religion, but whether they may be truſted in point of fidelity and Allegeance.</p>
            <p>But they doe alledge in that point, they are not to be truſted, ſince they refuſe to take the Oath of Allegeance and Supremacy; It were to be wiſhed, that thoſe bleſſed times had beene perpetuated to us,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:97840:4"/>
in which it had continued a good diſtinction, though not betweene ill Papiſts, yet betweene Jeſuited Papiſts and Proteſtants, the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king or refuſing of thoſe two Oathes; but wee have lived to ſee, that theſe two Oathes (to the intolerable ſcandall of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion) are indeed taken by ſome who call themſelves Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, but moſt manifeſtly violated; and refuſed to be taken by ſome Papiſts, and yet the tenour of them kept by thoſe refuſers.</p>
            <p>Our Saviours queſtion in the Goſpell was, <hi>Whether of the two was the better Servant, He who ſaid he would doe what his Master bid him, but did it not: or he who ſaid he would not doe it, but yet did it. this latter, by our Saviours approbation, was the better Servant:</hi> It is eaſie to be applied: hath not His Majeſty, and all the World reaſon to thinke that thoſe Recuſants who upon weake, yet ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming ſtrong grounds unto them, refuſed to take the Oath of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, and yet at this time performe the contents of it, are farre better Subjects and (in this point) farre better Chriſtians, then all thoſe Proteſtants who have taken this Oath, and yet at this time practiſe quite contrary to that which is contained in it? and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to what is contained in it, but to what is contained in the laſt Proteſtation, which they themſelves ſo magnified, and in it did ſo expreſſly averre the defence of the Kings Perſon and Dignity; ſo that the tumultuous Petitioners who came riding to the Parliament through the Streets of <hi>London,</hi> with that Proteſtation in their hats, ſeemed too honeſt and good Subjects, like men ſtanding up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſeverall Pilloryes with Papers in their hats, carrying in them their crime and condemnation for it.</p>
            <p>And beſides, it is well knowne, That there are other Recuſants in <hi>England</hi> beſides the Popiſh, and thoſe are ſuch, who will not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate in our Service and Sacraments as they are eſtabliſhed by the Lawes of this Kingdome; and yet ſome of theſe are admitted to ſit in either Houſe of Parliament; though, contrary to the order of Parliament, they have not received the Communion. And how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hundreds be in the adverſe Army, of Anabaptiſts, Browniſts, and other Sectaries, who by the Lawes of this Land are reputed farre more dangerous Recuſants, and doe incurre by the ſame Law, farre heavier puniſhments then ordinary Papiſts do; for they being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed are to abjure the Land and Kingdome; whereas Papiſts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre onely perſonall or pecuniary mulcts, if they be not Prieſts or
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:97840:5"/>
Jeſuites, or harbourers of them. If one would truly learne the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Doctrines of theſe Recuſant Separatiſts, and foreſee how, upon their owne ground and Tenents, when they ſhall have power to put them in practice, they will attempt the cutting of throats of all Landlords and Magiſtrates, and will maintaine, That it is againſt the Law of God for any Man to hold an Eſtate by Law or Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right; but onely according to Merit and worth. Let him read the Commentaries of <hi>John Sleidan</hi> a Grave and Wiſe Hiſtorian, who in the life of <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, hath excellently ſet downe their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable Tenents and Tragedies, broached and Acted by them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the beginning of the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Reformation, and is now in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and goes under the name of, <hi>A warning for England.</hi>

            <p>To conclude, I wiſh from my heart there were Recuſants of no kind in this Kingdome; I am reſolved, as I have lived, ſo to die in the profeſſion of the true reformed Religion, as it now ſtandeth eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by the Lawes of the Land, and as it was profeſſed, and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the pureſt times of peerleſſe Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and for theſe few Recuſants under my Command, I ſhall uſe all poſſible care, that they do nothing againſt the Lawes of this Kingdome, for I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them, not for their Religion, but for the Allegiance which they profeſſe to ſo gratious a King: whom I pray God to Protect, and long continue amongſt us, and let all good People ſay, <hi>Amen.</hi>
