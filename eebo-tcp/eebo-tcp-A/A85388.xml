         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of the new beginning Church of
Chriſt, that enemy who breathed out
threatnings and ſlaughter againſt the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples
of the Lord, after he was caſt down from his
horſe, and his pride was quelled by the might and
power of Chriſt, he was by the Lords order com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the care of <hi>Ananias, Acts</hi> 9. 11. True it is,
<hi>Ananias</hi> anſwered the Lord, that he was jealous and
fearefull of <hi>Saul,</hi> becauſe he had heard by many,
how much evill he had done to the Saints at <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
13. <hi>v.</hi> But the Lord replyed no more unto him,
but that he ſhould not feare nor miſtruſt him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he had turned his heart, and made him a cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
<pb facs="tcp:124762:3"/>
veſſell to beare his name before the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and
Kings, and children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> &amp; that he would teach
him how great things he ſhould ſuffer for his names
ſake. Let it pleaſe your Honour and Worſhips to
behold here my own caſe deciphered; for if <hi>Saul</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted
the Church of Chriſt; I my ſelfe have perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
the ſame Church, by oppoſing the doctrin of
it, by preaching and teaching contrary to it, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
to ſeduce ſoules from it, by writing againſt
it. But now it hath pleaſed that mighty and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Lord; againſt whom there is no reſiſtance, to
caſt me down upon the ground, to quell my pride,
to lighten me round about with the beames and
light of his mercies, to make me know how hard a
thing it is to kicke againſt the will &amp; calling of God,
and with trembling and feare to make me ſay, <hi>Lord
what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> If <hi>Saul</hi> was ſent to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcus</hi>
to <hi>Ananias,</hi> a chiefe and zealous follower of
Chriſt, that by him he might be protected from the
<hi>Jews</hi> and enemies of the Lord, who doubtles hearing
of his change and converſion would have cruelly
torne and ſlaughtered him if they could have found
him. So I my ſelfe by a ſecret and inward order,
which I have found by God delivered to my Soule,
have judged it meet and fit to ſearch out in this City
ſome zealous <hi>Ananias,</hi> ſome religious follower of
Chriſts pure doctrin, that I may be ſafely ſheltered &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:124762:3"/>
protected from the violent atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pts of the Lords ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
the Papiſts, who I know will endeavour to do
me all the miſchief they can. Therfore let it pleaſe
your Honor and W<hi rend="sup">ps</hi>. who are well known to be as
<hi>Ananias</hi> in <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> zealous and truly religious fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
of Chriſts own doctrin, and favorers of the
pure Word of the Lord, to caſt your eyes upon me a
new converted <hi>Saul,</hi> to ſhelter and protect me from
thoſe that plot my miſchief. O when ſureſt they are
to hinder my perſeverance in the truth, by plotting
and ſtudying my deſtruction, let them find me hove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
under the wings of your protection. O feare
not! nor ſay what <hi>Ananias</hi> ſaid, <hi>I have heard by many
of this man, how much evill he hath done to thy Saints,</hi> but
praiſe the work of the Lord in me, who hath opened
now my eyes, who hath brought me now out of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi>
who hath made me confeſſe my ſins and ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities
with a ſorrowfull and contrite heart. And as
it pleaſed the Lord to ſhew <hi>Saul,</hi> as ſoon as he was
converted how great things he ſhould ſuffer for his
names ſake; even ſo be you confident, as I my ſelf am
that this my calling &amp; converſion is purely &amp; meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from above and from the Lord; from whom I
have receiv'd this teſtimony, that he hath ſhewed me
already how great things I muſt ſuffer for his names
ſake; for I muſt for him ſuffer many injuries and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniations
from the Papiſts, I muſt ſuffer the loſſe
<pb facs="tcp:124762:4"/>
of all my kinred, I muſt ſuffer the loſſe of that main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
which I was wont to receive from them, I
muſt ſuffer want and poverty. But for whom? For
the Lords ſake; for the teaching and preaching the
preciſe rule of the Word of the Lord, for abjuring all
<hi>Popiſh</hi> errors, for renouncing all ſupertitions, for ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horring
all idolatries. Let theſe my ſufferings ſerve
to your Honor and Worſhips for a true teſtimony of
my converſion; let theſe my ſufferings remove from

thus with your favorable protectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I may rejoyce in

ſhall briefly touch what <hi>Iohn</hi> in the fift <hi>chap.</hi> of his
Goſpell writeth of a poole which was in <hi>Ieruſalem</hi>
called <hi>Betheſda:</hi> About this poole were wont to lye a
great multitude of impotent folke, blind, lame, and
withered, waiting for the moving of the water, which was done by
an Angel, who went down at a certain time into the poole and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
the water, and then whoſoever ſtepped in, was cured of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
diſeaſe he had. But one lying there 38 years, who in all this
time could never be cured, becauſe being of himſelfe impotent (as he
anſwered to our Saviour) he had no man, when the water was trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
to help him or to put him into the poole. I will not ſtand to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſe
this holy ſtory unto you at large, least you might justly ſay that
I abuſe to much your patience, by confounding the ſtile of an Epistle,
which ought to be brief, with the diviſion, parts and order of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.
Only I beg your patience ſo far as to peruſe this my enſuing
<pb facs="tcp:124762:5"/>
Sermon, and in it you ſhall find an impotent man, not only blind, but
deafe and dumbe, and truelly beaten by Satan, and by him expulſed
out of the Church of Christ, and as I may truly ſay) lying in this
miſery neare 3<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> years. The diſcourſe of my enſuing <hi>Sermon</hi> will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
You that I my ſelfe have been this impotent man. Many times
my Conſcience hath been moved and troubled from above with good
and heavenly inſpirations (which God hath been pleaſed to ſend in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
my ſoule) by my conſidered aberration from the true Church, for
which the waters of my teares and inward ſobs from my heart have
been alſo moved with the troubles of my ſoule. So that I would many
times full faine have ſtepped and entred into the true Church of
<hi>England,</hi> where all diſeaſes of the ſoule are most ſurely healed. But
alas! mine own impotency and weakneſſe joyned with my long blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
hindred the execution of my good reſolutions; temporall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
and feares kept back my ſteps. Many times I feared I ſhould
want a man and a friend (as the cripple at <hi>Betheſda</hi> did) to helpe
me, to encourage me, and to further my good deſires. I feared the
high Aſſembly of <hi>Parliament</hi> would rather mistrust him, that ſo
many years hath been an enemy to the State of this Kingdome, than
now in theſe times approve his penitency and contrition, which
might rather have ſeemed unto them a fained hypocriſie. All theſe
feares kept back for a time the forwardneſſe of my will and heart.
Untill at laſt I reſolved to diſcloſe and diſcover unto Your Worſhip,
theſe troubles of my heart, theſe diſeaſes of my ſoule, even the want
of a man to help me. God whom I ſought too pleaſed, with my
request; I found that aſsistance from you, that I ſo earneſtly deſired,
for, I found a man, I found a friend, I found a comforter, I found an
Advocate to plead for my pardon before that high Court now aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled.
For by Your meanes I have been quietly brought into the
Church; by Your meanes alſo, I hope, I ſhall be henceforth prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
againſt all ſlanderers, who will whet their tongues against me
and ſeeke to trouble me, and grudge at my good, as the Jews ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted

fruits of my Vocation, which in this humble. Work of mine, I have

            <p>And ſecondly, to cheriſh and comfort all thoſe that find themſelvs
ſeduced by this mortall enemy of all man kind, with the mercies of a
moſt loving and mercifull Father above, who not deſiring the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
death and deſtruction of a ſinner, but rather that he may turne
from his wickedneſſe and live; when pooreſt we are and moſt in

as alſo <hi>Paul</hi> doth teach us in the 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. Who finally when he ſeeth
us moſt in darkneſſe and in the night of ſinne, than doth he diſſolve

               </gap> ſhineth into our inward hearts, with the rayes and
light of his Grace and mercy.</p>
            <p>Bleſſed and praiſed be thy name, O Heavenly Father, that haſt
vouchſafed this day to lighten me in the horrid darkneſſe of my ſins,
that haſt viſited me in my Aegyptian ſlavery, and haſt brought me
out of that thraldome of Popery, into a land of Milke and Hony,
abounding with the ſweetnes of thy Grace and Mercies. Continue,
O Lord, theſe thy favours towards me ſo, that I may by my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
be an example to all ſinners to forſake their wickedneſſe, by
laying open unto them this day two principall and eſſentiall points,
to wit, the danger and horridneſſe of ſin, and thy unſpeakable mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
that thus I may perform what thou commandedſt <hi>Peter;</hi> and
that my ſelfe being converted, I may ſtrengthen my Brethren, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
them from ſin, and ſtrongly ſettling them in the true, ancient,
and Apoſtolique Faith.</p>
            <p>Dearely Beloved, The firſt point which is to be obſerved in the
words of my Text, is the tyranny, which the Devill practizeth over
a Chriſtian ſoule, contained in thoſe words of Chriſt our Saviour
ſpoken to <hi>Peter,</hi>
               <q>Behold Satan hath deſired to have you, that he may ſift you as wheat.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The deſire of Satan is not any way to do us good, but all the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe
he can. As ſoon as he hath got us into his claws, he produceth
(as far as lyeth in his power), Sentence of damnation againſt us, he
prepareth us, and putteth us in readineſſe for the fire of hell.</p>
            <p>The firſt preparation which hee maketh for our ſoules to burne
everlaſtaingly, is the ſame which ſhall happen unto every damned,
and curſed ſoule at the day of the laſt and dreadfull Iudgment, when
the Angels ſhall ſeparate the wicked from the good, as Chriſt our
Saviour foretold us by S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> in the 13 chap. in the Parable of
the ſeed, in the 41 <hi>ver.</hi> ſaying, <hi>The Son of man ſhall ſend forth, his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
and they ſhall gather out of his Kingdome all things that offend and
them which do iniquity.</hi> As a ſo in the ſame Chap. of <hi>Mat<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h.</hi> we reade
in the Parable of the net caſt into the Sea, and gathering of every
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:124762:7"/>
kind, which when it was full, they drew to ſhore, and ſate downe
and gathered the good into veſſels, but caſt the bad away. <hi>So</hi> (ſaith
our Saviour <hi>verſe</hi> 49) <hi>ſhall it be at the end of the world; The Angels
ſhall come forth, and ſever the wicked from the juſt, and ſhall caſt them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the furnace of fire.</hi> Behold how the neareſt preparation for the fire
of hell is the ſeparation of the wicked from the juſt.</p>
            <p>And after this followeth immediatly that dreadfull ſentence of
damnation, which ye ſhall find in <hi>Matth. 25. 41. Depart from me ye
curſed into everlaſting fire, prepared for the Devill and his Angels.</hi> If
this be a horrid thing to conſider, and which ought to make our
haire ſtand upright, and our fleſh to tremble; let not us laugh, but
feare and tremble to fall into Satans hands, hearing out of the words
of my Text, that his only deſire is to ſever us from the elect and
godly, to prepare us for the finall ſentence of Iudgment, to make us
ready for the curſe of God and everlaſting fire of hell. For what can
more plainly be underſtood by theſe words of our Saviour to <hi>Peter?</hi>
               <q>Satan hath deſired to have you, that he may ſift you as wheat.</q>
            </p>
            <p>What doth the Husbandman, when he ſifteth his wheat, but with
the help of the wind ſeparate the chaffe from the good grane? Even
ſo the Devill ſtriveth and endeavoureth to ſift us as wheat; which is
as much as to ſay, to ſeparate us from the Elect and choſen people of
the Lord, from the good Laws of God, from the good and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
Doctrine of the Church. This was the only endeavour of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
the night of the Paſſion of our Lord, to ſever and ſeparate not
only <hi>Peter,</hi> but the reſt of the diſciples from the company of their
maſter like chaffe from the true grane: who ſaid of himſelfe, that he
was the grane that was to be buried in the earth, that afterwards he
might ſpring up again with great increaſe for all his Church. O if
every Chriſtian ſoule would take this point to conſideration, how
the Devill deſireth and endeavoureth to ſever us like chaffe, fit for
nothing but for the fire, and for that dreadfull ſentence of damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>Depart from me ye curſed into everlaſting fire;</hi> Doubtles we would
feare to commit the ſins which daily we commit, doubtles we would
tremble to yeeld to the power of ſuch a tyrant; doubtleſſe we would
take no reſt in ſin as we do, if we did but conſider that by it we are
become dry chaffe ſeparated from the heavenly grane our Saviour
Chriſt, ſevered from all thoſe fruitfull granes and members of the
Church, who ſtanding on the right hand ſhall through their fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:124762:8"/>
Faith at laſt be laid up in that ſtorehouſe of everlaſting bliſſe and
felicity; when the ſinner like chaffe already ſevered from the grane
by the Devils endeavours, expecteth nothing but death to burn for
ever.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the 12 Chap. of</hi> Judges <hi>and</hi> 6 ver. <hi>I have obſerved a pretty Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
for this purpoſe, where the Scripture ſpeaking of a battaile
fought betwixt the</hi> Gileadites <hi>and the</hi> Ephraimites <hi>ſaith, that the
men of</hi> Gilead <hi>ſmote</hi> Ephraim, <hi>and put the</hi> Ephraimites <hi>to flight to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the river of</hi> Jordan, And the Gileadites tooke the paſſages of
Jordan before the Ephraimites; And it was ſo that when thoſe Ephrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites
which were eſcaped, ſaid, Let me go over, that the man of Gilead
ſaid unto him, Art thou an Ephraimite? If he ſaid Nay. Then ſaid
they unto him, ſay now Shibbobeth; and he ſaid Sibboleth; for he could
not frame to pronounce it right; Then they tooke him and ſlew him at the
paſſage of Jordan, and there fell at that time of the Ephraimites fourty
and two thouſand.</p>
            <p>Dearely Beloved, two things I would wiſh you to note in this
Hiſtory of Holy Scripture.</p>
            <p>The firſt, that at the paſſages over <hi>Jordan</hi> theſe <hi>Ephraimites</hi> were
examined who they were.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that becauſe they could not ſay <hi>Shibboleth,</hi> but inſteed
of it they ſaid <hi>Sibboleth,</hi> therefore they were ſlaine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Shibboleth,</hi> according to the true tranſlation ſigniſieth <hi>An eare of
Corne.</hi> And <hi>Sibboleth</hi> ſignifieth the chaffe or the ſtraw that remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
when the corne is ſeparated from it. So that we find that the
ſword killed all ſuch as could not ſay <hi>Shibboleth</hi> or <hi>Eare of Corne,</hi> but
inſtead of it pronounced <hi>Sibboleth, Straw or chaffe</hi> ſeparated from the
corne.</p>
            <p>O Chriſtian and devout Soule, take out of this a leſſon of mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and judge thy ſelfe a rebellious <hi>Ep<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>raimite,</hi> always warring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
thy God and Maker. When thou ſinneſt, what doeſt thou
but rebell againſt thy Creator? who at laſt will be too hard for
thee. But when? When he ſhall meet thee at the paſſage over <hi>Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi>
that is, when as water thou ſhalt ſlide away. <hi>Omnes morimur &amp;
quaſi aqua dilabimur,</hi> we do all dye, and like water ſlide and fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.
O what a day will that be, when thy Soule is to paſſe away
from thy body? When thy Soule is to paſſe over from this world
to the other yet never ſeen? O then ſhall meet thee the true <hi>Gileadite,</hi>
againſt whom thou haſt rebelliouſly fought with the Sword of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:124762:8"/>
in his hand; then ſhall begin thy tryall for thy life or death of
thy Soule, then ſhalt thou be commanded to ſay <hi>Shibboleth,</hi> to ſay if
truely thou beeſt an ear full of weighty and fruitfull grane of fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Faith: But if thou canſt not ſay but <hi>Sibboleth,</hi> that thou art fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,
that thou art a light ſtraw, a little chaffe ſeparated from the
true grane Chriſt Ieſus; then expect the wrath of God, expect the
the bloud of his ſword of Iuſtice, expect if he find thee among the
wicked ſeparated from the good, that this thy being ſifted, this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
and ſeparation of thee from the juſt and righteous ſhall be a
fore-running meſſenger of that finall ſentence of damnation, <hi>Depart
from me you curſed into everlasting fire.</hi> God forbid that in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
there be any ſuch chaffe, any ſuch dry ſtraw ſeparated from
the fruitfull granes of the Church, and fit only for the ſlames of Hel.
I hope, the Devill hath not ſo far prevailed with any. But of my
ſelfe with ſhame (I may ſay) that I have been that rebellious <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraimite,</hi>
that have almoſt 40 years warred obſtinatly againſt my
Lord and Maker. I am that wicked <hi>Ephraimite,</hi> not able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
ſince my firſt uſe of reaſon this word <hi>Shiboleth,</hi> not able to
ſay I had ever any fruitfull Faith, or have ever been a f<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uitful grane,
but have always pronounced <hi>Sibboleth,</hi> have alwayes beene like bran
ſifted from the white flower, like chaffe ſeparated from
the grane, fit onely for the fire of Hell. For what fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Faith could be in me, that inſtead of worſhipping only my God
and Lord, have bowed my knee ſo often to worſhip for God a peece
of bread, according to that damnable doctrine of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> (which
now I abjure and renounce) who teach that in their Communion is
no ſubſtance of bread or wine, but the true Reall and Phyſicall body
and bloud of Chriſt? A thing ſo againſt Scripture, which teacheth
that Chriſt ſince his glorious Aſcenſion can be no more upon the
earth, much leſſe in ſeverall places and ſeverall peeces of bread, but
that he muſt be in Heaven, untill that laſt Iudgment day, as ye ſhall
find in the 3 Chap. of the <hi>Acts</hi> in the 20, 21. <hi>verſ.</hi> ſaying, <hi>And hee
ſhal ſena Jeſus Chriſt, which before was preached unto you, whom the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
must receive untill the time of restitution of all things, which God
hath ſpoken by the mouth of all his holy Prophets, ſince the World began.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What fruitfull Faith could be in me, who ſo often have kneeled
to Images, worſhipped them, burnt Franckincenſe before them, and
praid unto them, ſo contrary to the Commandements of God?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thou ſhalt not make unto thee any graven Image or any likeneſſe of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:124762:9"/>
any thing that is in Heaven above. Thou ſhalt not bow downe unto
them?</hi> So contrary, I ſay, to holy Scripture, which teacheth that no
Saints are to be called upon, no Saints are to be Mediators between
us and God, but only Ieſus Chriſt, as ye ſhall find in the 1 Epiſtle of
<hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Tim.</hi> in the 2 Chap. and 5 verſe, <hi>For there is one God, and one
Mediator between God and man, the Man Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What fruitfull Faith hath been in mee, who have beleeved and
taught a Purgatory, a place of ſatisfaction for ſins, derogating by
this moſt damnable doctrin from the infinity of Chriſts ſatisfaction,
who had not aboundantly nor infinitly ſatisfied for us, if we our
ſelves ought in fire and torments to adde ſatisfaction to the ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
made by his moſt pretious bloud. O good God, how do I now
perceive my ſelf to have been ſequeſtred from thy juſt and righteous
beleevers! to have beene ſequeſtred from thy true Apoſtolike and
Primitive Church, to have be<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n ſifted like branne from the flower,
like chaffe from the corne. O moſt mercifull Father, if in theſe 40
yeares, I had met with thee at the paſſage of <hi>Jordan,</hi> at the paſſage of
my Soule from my body, not being able to ſay <hi>Shibboleth,</hi> what
could I have expected but to feele the ſmart of thy ſword, to receive
the wound of everlaſting death, to heare that dreadful curſe of thine,
<hi>Depart from me you curſed into everlaſting fire?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But think not, Dearely Beloved, that Satans cruelty is ſatisfied
with thus ſeparating a ſinner like chaffe from the corne, by making
him ready for Hell fire; O yet his cruelty goeth forward, yet he ſif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
further a Soule. Though properly to ſift in our Engliſh tongue,
be to ſift the flower from the branne; Yet this word <hi>ſifting,</hi> in Greek
is more Emphaticall, for the true word, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in Greek, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to M.<hi>Cameron's</hi> explication, ſignifieth <hi>Cribrare,</hi> which as he
ſaith, containeth two things, to wit, <hi>illa concuſſio &amp; agitatio,</hi> that
thraſhing and beating of the wheat; and alſo <hi>illa diviſio &amp; ſeparatio,</hi>
that diviſion and ſeparation of the chaffe f<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>om the corne. So by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan's
ſifting a Soule as wheat, we muſt know, that he is not conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to ſeparate a Soule from the Church, and the fruitfull granes and
members of it, yet his cruelty goeth forward, for he knoweth Gods
mercies are great, and touch the ſoule of a ſinner daily to bring him
to repentance; therefore he deſireth our perſeverance in ſin, our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy
and hardneſſe, that we may no way return unto our Lord. He
uſeth yet more tyranny over us by ſifting us; he beateth us yet with
blows, even as the corn is beaten with the flaile; with one blow hee
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:124762:9"/>
beateth out our eyes, that we may not ſee the hideous eſtate we are in.
With another blow he ſtriketh at our tongues, and breaketh the
mouths of our hearts, that we may not call upon God for helpe and
ſuccour; with another blow he ſhuts up our eares, that we may not
heare nor give eare to the truth when it is preached. Even as a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
when he beſiegeth a Caſtle, taketh up al the high ways, wherby
any maintenance or proviſion may come to theſe within the Caſtle;
So doth this cruell enemy of ma<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>kind, when he hath ſeparated a ſoule
from the good and righteous, he ſhuts up all the high wayes, which
are the mouth of the heart, the hearing of it, the eyes of the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
that ſo no maintenance, nor ſpirituall food may enter into it.
This was figured in <hi>Mark</hi> 9. 17. 18. where it is ſaid that one of the
multitude brought unto our Saviour, his ſon which had a dumb ſpirit:
And he ſaid, <hi>Wherſoever he taketh him, he teareth him, and he fometh, &amp;
gnaſheth with his teeth and pineth away.</hi> By this dumb Devill ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is to be underſtood the effect which the Devill worketh in a ſoule,
which he hath once poſſeſſed, making it dumb and ſpeechleſſe, that it
may not cry out to the Lord, nor acknowledge its ſins with one <hi>pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cavi.</hi>
And many of the Fathers upon the explication of this dumbe
Spirit, ſay that it was alſo deaf and blind, to ſignifie the two other
effects, which the Devill worketh in a ſoule, which he hath once got
into his power. This ſame deſtruction of a Soule according to the
Fathers expoſition was ſignified by that deaf and dumbe man, whom
our Saviour cured, as ye may read <hi>Mark 7. 33, 34, 35. And he took him
aſide from the multitude; and put his fingers into his eares, and he ſpit, and
touched his tongue; And looking up to Heaven, he ſighed, and ſaith unto
him, ephphatha, that is, be opened. And ſtrait way his eares were opened, &amp;
the ſtring of his tongue was looſed, and he ſpeake plaine.</hi> In the 7 of <hi>Dan</hi> 5
<hi>ver.</hi> you ſhall find a like figure of this cruell tyrant, where <hi>Daniel</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
a dreame and viſion which he had, faith, <hi>And behold another
beaſt, a ſecond like to a Beare, and it raiſed up it ſelfe on one ſide, and it had
three ribs in the mouth between the teeth of it, And they ſaid thus unto it,
ariſe, devore much fleſh.</hi> Although S. <hi>Hierom</hi> by this ugly beaſt doth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
the Kingdom of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> and by thoſe 3 ribs and 3 ſet
of teeth between rib and rib, expoundeth the 3 Empires of the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonians,
Perſians</hi> and <hi>Medes;</hi> Yet <hi>Richardus de Sancto Victore,</hi> and
many Fathers in a ſpirituall ſenſe, declare this ugly <hi>Beare</hi> to be a true
portraicture of the malicious ſpite of the Devill, who with 3 ſet and
orders of teeth devoureth and deſtroyeth the three noble powers,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:124762:10"/>
wherewith the Soule doth ſpiritually ſpeake, ſee, and heare.</p>
            <p>And truly in my mind, no Beaſt is a more proper Embleme of the
Devill, than the <hi>Beare,</hi> if we conſider well what <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his 7
Book <hi>De Hiſtor. Animal.</hi> and 17 Chap. writeth of this beaſt, which is
that he eateth of all things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the fruits of trees, of herbes, of Bees
and Honey, of little <hi>Amits,</hi> and their egs, yea of your ſhell fiſhes, and
alſo of fleſh. A ſtrange quality, proper only to this Beaſt! For if
the <hi>Lyon</hi> eat fleſh, he eateth not hay, graſſe nor hearbs; and the <hi>Oxe</hi>
that eateth hay and graſſe eateth not fleſh, Only the <hi>Beare</hi> eateth of
all ſorts, and with this quality reſembleth the Devill more than any
other Beaſt. For the Devill devoureth and eateth of all; If a man
be given to the fleſh, there is the Devill ſporting alſo himſelfe with
thoſe fleſhy thoughts: If like an Eremite one feed of hearbes only;
there alſo wil Satan be endeavouring in the wildernes to overthrow
thoſe that hide themſelves there, flying from the vanities of the
world, as he hath tempted and overthrown many ſuch. If one ſay,
he is ſo abſtinent that he will not eat any fleſh, but feed only upon
fiſh, as ſome Monkes and Fryars do amongſt your Papiſts; O how
freely doth the Devill feed alſo with them, and for all their boaſting
of their Abſtinence, blindeth them and maketh them commit moſt
horrid and enormous ſins of the fleſh and Idolatry, as mine owne
ſight and knowledge can teſtifie. If one like a little <hi>Amit</hi> in the
earth, humble himſelf ſo deeply as to confeſſe and acknowledge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
duſt and clay, and to conceipt moſt lowly of himſelfe; there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
will Satan feed, untill he make him proud of his own low and
humble conceipt. If like a Bee feeding upon the ſweetneſſe of Hony
any one be in the Church feeding upon ſweetneſſe of Prayer and
Contemplation, delighting with the ſweetneſſe of ſinging Prayſe
and Pſalmes unto the Lord; there alſo will this <hi>Beare</hi> the Devill
ſtrive to feed, untill he tempts with ſome fooliſh and idle thoughts.
In all like a <hi>Beare</hi> feeding of all ſorts, and therefore may well be
compared to that <hi>Beare</hi> which <hi>Daniell</hi> ſaw, riſing up to devoure
much fleſh. And as that <hi>Beare</hi> had three ſet or ſorts of teeth to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voure
the three Empires of the <hi>Babylonians, Perſians</hi> and <hi>Medes;</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
ſo hath the Devill three ſeverall ſorts of warlike engins to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
and overthrow thoſe three Forts and Caſtles of our Soule, to
wit, the Sight, Speach and Hearing, that ſo no reliefe may come from
God to that wretched ſinner, whom he hath once poſſeſſed.</p>
            <p>Firſt he maketh us dumb, that we may not open our mouths to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:124762:10"/>
confeſſe and acknowledge before God the grievouſneſſe of our ſins,
nor crie out for help with our hearts to our only Mediatour Ieſus
Chriſt. Have not ye obſerved a <hi>Wolfe,</hi> when he hath ſeized upon a
little <hi>Lambe</hi> and ſequeſtred it from the flock and Shepheard; how
the firſt thing he doth, is to ſtrangle it in the throat, that it may not
bale nor cry out and be reſcued by the Shepheard? Even ſo doth the
Devill, when he hath got a Soule from the flock of Chriſt: the firſt
thing he doth is to ſtrangle it, that it may not ſpeake, nor cry out to
him that ſaid by S. <hi>John, Ego ſum Paſtor bonus,</hi> I am the good Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor
and Shepheard: For he knoweth there is no better way, no
ſurer remedy for us, than to acknowledge and confeſſe to God our
grievous ſins; as <hi>David</hi> ſaith in the 32 <hi>Pſalme</hi> and 6 verſe, <hi>I ſaid, I
will confeſſe my ſins unto the Lord; And ſo thou forgaveſt the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of my ſin.</hi> He knoweth that God will have a ſinner accuſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
confeſſe his ſins before him, and that this was one of the firſt
leſſons that ever God taught in this world, as ye may obſerve in the
third chapter of <hi>Geneſis</hi> and 9 verſe, where we read that when <hi>Adam</hi>
had ſinned, God came down into Paradiſe, and called upon him,
ſaying, <hi>Where art thou?</hi> Not that God was ignorant where <hi>Adam</hi>
was, nor that <hi>Adam</hi> could hide himſelfe from the ſight of God: But
God called him and asked him, where he was, becauſe he would
have <hi>Adam</hi> accuſe himſelf, confeſſe and acknowledge his nakedneſſe,
and the ſin he had fallen into; for to teach all wretched and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
ſinners to confeſſe and acknowledge their ſins and miſeries be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their Lord.</p>
            <p>O this Satan knoweth to be the chiefe remedy, the beaſt eaſe for
an afflicted ſoule! therefore hee ſtriketh his firſt blow at the mouth
of the heart, that there may ſound no act of repentance, nor the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
may have a tongue to confeſſe and acknowledge himſelfe to have
wickedly offended his Lord and Maker.</p>
            <p>O the Devill knoweth that nothing endangereth more a Soule in
ſin than dumbneſſe and ſilence! as <hi>David</hi> alſo teſtifieth in the ſame
32 <hi>Pſalme</hi> and 3 verſe, ſaying, <hi>For while I held my tongue, my bones
conſumed away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O how doth a ſinner pine and conſume away for want of crying
out to the Lord, for want of acknowledging his own wretched e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate!</p>
            <p>O Dearely Beloved, make uſe of this Doctrine, and whenſoever
ye find your ſelves to have been carried away by Satan, forget not
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:124762:11"/>
your tongues, be not dumbe, acknowledge preſently your iniquities
before the Lord, touch with your tongues the leper and ſores of your
ſoules, let not them feſter for want of a tongue to heale them. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
when ye are in ſin, ye are as the Pſalmiſt ſaith, like Beaſts
without reaſon.</p>
            <p>O ſhew at leaſt to have that ſmall ſenſe and reaſon, which many
Beaſts and a Dog hath, who when he is bitten and full of ſoares, with
his tongue only preſerveth his ſoares from feſtering. Even ſo do
thou poore and wretched ſinner, when thy ſoule is bitten with the
firſt ſet of teeth of this cruell <hi>Beare,</hi> lift up thy heart unto thy Lord,
acknowledge and confeſſe thy ſins before him, with thy tongue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
thy ſoule from inward feſtering. Remember that God will
have thee confeſſe thy iniquity and aske pardon of him. Be not
therefore dumbe, O ſinner I (if any there be beſides my ſelfe in this
Congregation) ſay with <hi>David, I will confeſſe my ſinnes unto the Lord;</hi>
Cry out with the prodigall ſon in the 15 Chapter of <hi>Luke</hi> and 18.
Verſe, <hi>Father I have ſinned againſt Heaven, and before thee.</hi> Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
thou haſt a Heavenly Shepheard above, Ieſus Chriſt: Bale and
cry out unto him like the little Lambe, that is ſet upon by the rave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
Wolfe. Be ſure thou beeſt not mute nor dumbe: be ſure the
Devill take not from thee the uſe of thy tongue.</p>
            <p>O a man that is fallen into a deep water, hath hopes of life if the
water reach but to his knees, or to his breaſt, or to his ſhoulders;
but if once it reach to enter into his mouth to choke him, eminent is
the danger he is in. Even ſo if a ſinner be plunged and drowned ſo
deepely into the depth of ſin, that it hath reached to his mouth, that
it once hinder his tongue from confeſſing his wickedneſſe, and from
crying out to God; great danger is he in. Feare this danger, O
Beloved; feare that the mouth of your hearts be not ſtopped by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
that by this high way which leadeth to the inward Caſtle of
your Soule, all Ammunition, all helpe and ſuccour from above bee
not ſtopped and robbed for want of acknowledging your ſins, and
crying out unto your Lord for preſent aide and relief. And ſo much
for this.</p>
            <p>The ſecond blow which the Devill ſtriketh at a ſinner, is to
beat out his eyes and to blind him, that he may not ſee the danger
he is in, nor his own wretched and miſerable eſtate, as <hi>David</hi>
affirmeth in the 38 <hi>Pſal.</hi> and 10. <hi>verſe,</hi> ſaying, <hi>My heart panteth,
my ſtrength hath failed me, and the ſight of mine eyes is gone from mee.</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:124762:11"/>
And again in the 40 <hi>Pſalme</hi> and 15 <hi>verſe</hi> he ſaith, <hi>Innumerable trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
are come about me; my ſinnes have taken ſuch hold upon me, that I
am not able to look up.</hi> O the Devid knoweth very well, that if a
ſinner did but ſee the miſerable and wretched eſtate his ſoule is in,
he would make haſt to returne unto his Lord; therefore he blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
him that he may run head-long down to Hell. He dealeth with
a ſinner as cruelly as <hi>Nabuchadnezzar</hi> King of <hi>Babell</hi> dealt with
<hi>Zedekiah,</hi> as ye may read in the 2 of <hi>Kings, 25 Chapter</hi> and 7 <hi>verſe,
And they ſlew the ſons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put out the eyes of
Zedekiah, and bound him in chaines and carried him to Babell.</hi> Even
ſo doth the Devill with a ſinner, he beateth out his eyes, bindeth
him in chaines, and ſo carrieth him to <hi>Babell,</hi> to a Chaos of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion.</p>
            <p>This a ſinner will not beleeve, but runs forward with more and
more delight in his iniquities; he thinkes, becauſe he enjoyeth his
corporall ſight, that his ſoule is not blinded. Tell me then, if a man
ſhould be in ſo deſperate a caſe, as running a long a ſtreet, and all
crying out unto him and ſaying, O man art thou mad, doeſt thou
not ſee ſuch an one thine enemy ſtanding before thee with his ſword
drawn to kill thee? If nevertheleſſe and for all theſe cries, this
man ſhould run towards the ſword; would not we ſay that he is
mad, or rather blind and not able to ſee the ſword before him?</p>
            <p>O Dearely Beloved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this is no ſporting matter; when we
offend the Lord, we are ſurely blind; If we were not, how would
we dare to runne upon the ſword which the Iuſtice of God hath
drawn againſt us? If we will not believe this, let us but turne to
the 7 <hi>Pſalme of David,</hi> and read there the 12, 13, and 14 <hi>verſes,</hi>
where we ſhall find theſe words, <hi>God is a righteous Judge, ſtrong and
patient, and God is provoked every day; If a man will not turne, he will
whet his ſword, he hath bent his bow, and made it ready; he hath prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for him the inſtruments of death.</hi> Behold a ſword a whetting for
us to run us thorow, a bow bent to ſhoot at us, other inſtruments
prepared only for our death and deſtruction. And yet we will not
ſee them, we run upon them: Why? Becauſe wee are blind, the
Devill hath deprived us of our ſpirituall ſight: We are like that
wicked and diſobedient Prophet <hi>Balaam,</hi> of whom we read in the
22 <hi>Chapter of Numbers</hi> and 23 <hi>Verſe,</hi> that he was ſo blind that he
could not ſee the Angell of the Lord ſtanding in his way with a
Sword drawn in his hand; the words are theſe, <hi>And when the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:124762:12"/>
Aſſe ſaw the Angel of the Lord ſtand in the way, and his ſword drawne
in his hand, the Aſſe turned out of the way, and went into the field, but
Balaam ſmote the Aſſe to turne her into the way.</hi> Lo here, how a
ſimple and ſilly Aſſe by Gods permiſſion, eſpyeth the ſword of the
Lord drawn againſt a ſinner and wicked Prieſt, to teach us, how
thoſe that are ſimple and humble in their own conceipts, ſee the
dangers that a ſinner runs into by ſin: But the proud and ſtubborne
Delinquent againſt Gods Laws, will not ſee theſe dangers. Becauſe
alas he is blind, the Devill hath pulled out the eyes of his Soule, the
windows whereby the light and beames of Gods mercy were wont
to ſhine into his heart, are <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ow rammed up with lime and ſtone<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that no light may come in for a ſinner to ſee thoſe horrid Aſpids, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilisks
and Adders, which lye lurking and taking their repoſe in the
cloſe and ſecret chamber of his Conſcience.</p>
            <p>O Pity! O Compaſſion! If any be to be had, when a ſinner is
come to this miſery. O Dearely Beloved, make good uſe of this
Doctrine, and fly from ſin all your lives; ſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>are to be thus blinded:
Pray to the Lord, that though through mans frailty ye do commit
a ſin: O yet your ſight may be left ye: One eye at leaſt may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
to lift up to God, to look up to him.</p>
            <p>Remember how that poore and lame cripple, of whom we read
in the 3 <hi>Chapter</hi> of the <hi>Acts,</hi> and 4 <hi>Verſe,</hi> received bodily health and
ſtrength, having no limbe to help himſelfe, but was daily carried
and laid at the gate of the Temple; <hi>And Peter fastning his eyes upon
him with John, ſaid, looke on us.</hi> Nothing was demanded of him but
only the uſe of his eyes; for looking only up upon <hi>Peter</hi> hee was
cured.</p>
            <p>O Deare Soule, Moralize this healing of this Cripple and the
manner of it, and take out of it a leſſon how to obtaine more eaſily
the health of thy diſeaſed ſoule. If with no limbe thou beeſt able to
helpe thy ſelfe: Looke up at leaſt to God, lift up the eyes of thy heart
to thy Lord, pray dayly to him that thy ſight may not faile in thy
inward man; Pray that the Devill may not blind thee howſoever,
but that thou mayeſt ſee the enormity and hideouſneſſe of thy ſin, the
inſtruments of death which God hath prepared againſt thee, the
Sword of his Iuſtice drawn, the Bow of his wrath and anger bent;
that thus having eyes left thee to ſee thoſe dangers, thou mayeſt like
this Cripple, as he looked up to <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> and received bodily
health: ſo thou alſo by caſting an eye up to the Lord, by opening the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:124762:12"/>
the window of thy heart mayeſt let in the light of Gods mercy to
ſhine within thee, and mayeſt receive the ſpirituall health of thy
leprous and diſeaſed ſoule. And ſo much for this.</p>
            <p>The laſt and deadlieſt blow, which the Devill with his heavy
ſtayle ſtriketh at a Soule, is in the Eares, wherewith hee fells him
quite down and layes him ſlat to the ground, taking his hearing
quite from him, and making him deafe, that hee may not heare the
word of the Lord, nor hearken to any comfortable tydings of his
Salvation.</p>
            <p>Of the wretched ſinners deafenes againſt the Word of God, <hi>Paul</hi>
ſpoke in the ſecond Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy</hi> in the 4 <hi>Chapter</hi> and 4 <hi>verſe,</hi>
ſaying, <hi>And they ſhall turne away their eares from the truth and ſhall
be turned unto fables.</hi> Of this ſort of ſinners, an Ancient Father, <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Alexandranus</hi> in his exhortation to the Greckes and Gentiles
ſpeaketh thus, <hi>Coelum feciſtis Scenam, &amp; Deus factus eſt vobis Actus:</hi>
Ye have made a ſport and play of Heaven, and God himſelf is become
at Act or Comedy unto ye.</p>
            <p>But you will ſay, Dearely Beloved, what meaneth this ancient
Author by theſe words? An example will declare his mind better.
Have not you marked in theſe Playes here about the City? How
ſometimes one commeth out upon the Stage, with a Crowne and
Kingly Diadem upon his head, and with a Scepter in his hand, gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Princely favours, and highly rewarding thoſe that have been
dutiful and loyall Subjects unto him? Another you ſhall ſee come
out upon the ſame Stage with a ſword drawn, all bloudy, with
ſtreams of bloud trickling down from his head to his feet, as if he had
been wounded in ſome ſierce and deſperate combate. Then you ſhal
ſee ſometimes over the Stage the Heavens open, great glory of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
appearing, and one deſcending in a cloud. Somtimes you ſhall
ſee from under the Stage aſcend a ſmoak of Fire and Brimſtone, and
a Devill leap up in ſuch a ſhape as may ſuffice to terrifie you. At all
this you laugh, you hold it but a fable. The King you ſee come out,
you reſpect not, becauſe you know he is none. The other that is
wounded and all bloudy, you pity not, becauſe you know that bloud
is not true but painted bloud. The glory you ſee and the Angels in
it, do no way entice you to it, becauſe you know it is but fained:
The Fire and Brimſtone, and ugly ſight of Devils that come upon
the Stage do nothing terrifie you. Why? Becauſe you know all is
ſalfe, that there is no Hell, nor any true Devill, but only a repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation

of it: So that you ſport and laugh at all.</p>
            <p>Now then let us apply theſe words and this ſimilitude of <hi>Clement
Alexandrinus</hi> to thoſe deafe ſinners, who, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, Turn away
their eares from the truth, and are turned unto Fables. Theſe when
they come to heare the word of the Lord, will not heare it with
their hearts, but make a play ſport of it. When they heare the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
ſet forth the might and power of that King of Kings, and Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator
of all things, who will glorifie his elect ſervants with everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
bliſſe and happineſſe; Like Atheiſts they laugh at it, and iudge
of this eternall King as of a King in a play.</p>
            <p>When they heare the Preacher teach, how Ieſus Chriſt was whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
reviled, ſtroken, ſmitten and crowned with thornes, nayled
with nailes, pierced with a ſpeare for their ſins; their hearts will
not heare it, they make ſport of it, they are not moved to love ſo lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a Saviour and Mediator who with the price of his own bloud,
made an aboundant and copious ſatisfaction for our ſins.</p>
            <p>When they heare the Preacher teach the glory of Heaven, the
Quires of Angels there, that everlaſting reſt without any ſob or
teares, without any cold, hunger, or thirſt, they will not heare it to
beleeve, they judge of it, as of the glory in a play upon a Stage, and
like Epicureans eate, drink and riot ſaying,
<q>—Post mortem nulla voluptas.</q>
            </p>
            <p>They think that their ſoules after death like Beaſts ſhall be diſſolved
into the aire to nothing. When they heare a Preacher bring out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Stage in the Pulpit, and ſet before a great aſſembly the deepe
pits of Hell, the Legions of fierce and cruell Divels there, the always
burning fire and Brimſtone, the everlaſting broiling there, the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
gnaſhing of teeth, the paines and torments due to their ſins, if
they turne not to God; Alas they will not heare it with their heart,
they thinke it is but a Hell of a Play, they are turned unto Fables,
they make a ſport of all, they make an Act or Play of God, they think
all fained, they heare it with their corporall eares, but with the
cares of their ſoule, they will not hearken unto it; they make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
the Actors of the fooles part in this ſport and play, which they
make of God and Heaven. Why? Becauſe the Devill hath made
them deafe. This is his chiefe way, he knoweth, though it be damb
or blind, yet by hearing the Word of the Lord with a well diſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

the <hi>Romanes</hi> in the 10 <hi>Chap.</hi> and 17 <hi>Verſ.</hi> ſaying, <hi>So then Faith cometh
by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God.</hi> This is the Devils feare,
and therefore he ſhutteth up their eares, that no maintenance that
way, no ſuccour, no reliefe may come unto the ſoule. With this he
maketh them groan under his yoke, with this he maketh them ſlaves
unto him. In <hi>Deut.</hi> 15. 12. you ſhall find that God gave a Command
of releaſe, ſaying, <hi>And if thy Brother, an Hebrew man, or an Hebrew
woman be ſold unto thee, and ſerve thee ſix years, then in the ſeventh yeare
thou ſhalt let him go free from thee.</hi> And lower 16, 17. <hi>v.</hi> God comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
thus; <hi>And it ſhall be, if he ſay unto thee, I will not go away from
thee, becauſe he loveth thee and thine houſe, becauſe he is well with thee.
Then ſhalt thou take an Aule, and thrust it thorough his eare unto the
doore, and he ſhall be thy ſervant for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a morall and ſpirituall ſenſe, Learn here, Deare Brethren, how
as God commanded a releaſe for debts and for ſervants, ſo doubtleſſe
he expecteth that thy Soule ſhall not be always under any other ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
but himſelf. If therfore the Devill have been thy Maſter for ſome
time, thinke for a releaſe, think of releaſing thy ſelf from him; do not
ſay, deare ſoule, unto the Devill, I will not go away from thee, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<hi>I</hi> love thee, becauſe I am well with thee; which if thou doeſt,
then will Satan make uſe of this Law of God for himſelfe and for
his own en<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s; then will he marke thee in the eares for a perpetuall
ſlave, with an Aule he will boare thine eares thorow, and faſten them
to a wall, to that wall which thy iniquities have put between thee
and God; he will keep thee for his ſlave, if ever he marke thee in thy
eares, he will take thy hearing from thee, that thou mayeſt not heare
any goodneſſe, nor make good uſe of any. O what miſery is a ſinner
in, when he commeth to loſe his hearing! Abhorre from ſin, dearely
beloved, leaſt ye fall thus into ſlavery under the tyranny of Satan; if
ye have not found your ſelves ſo far gone, nor ſo far enſnared by the
Devill, as he doth enſnare others, renounce him at his firſt aſſaults,
leaſt he encroach upon the mouth of your heart and ſoule, upon the
eyes and eares of it, making yee dumb, deaf and blind. O take ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
by me, who have had experience of theſe 3 blows, who have
been flailed, beaten and thraſhed by this cruell enemy; with one
blow I have been left ſpeechleſſe and dumb almoſt 40 years; I have
not had a tongue till this day, to confeſſe before God my iniquities,
my idolatries, my ſuperſtitions, my diſloyalties to my King, the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:124762:16"/>
Lords Annoynted. O I have been blind, &amp; wilfully blind, and would
not ſee my errors, the errors of the <hi>Whore of Babylon.</hi> True it is, many
years ago by reading Authors and the grounds of our true Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Religion; I did ſee the light of it, the truth of it, the ſincere, pure
and candid doctrine of it: but yet with the eyes of my Soule I would
not ſee it. I was like a foule and ugly Monky, who when he chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
to ſee his foule ſhape, his deformed feet in a pure and Criſtall
Looking-glaſſe, rageth, and flingeth at the glaſſe and teareth it in
pieces, becauſe it repreſentes unto him his own deformity. Even ſo
have I done, dearely Beloved, theſe many yeares. When I read the
pure and Chriſtall doctrine of our Church, which teacheth even
what Chriſt taught <hi>Peter</hi> and his Diſciples to acknowledge a Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
next to God to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> by taking mony out of a fiſhes belly, and
ſending it for trib te to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> a leſſon for all Subjects (yea for the
<hi>Popes</hi> themſelves who can be no better than Chriſt and <hi>Peter</hi>) to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
their duty and Allegiance next to God unto their Kings,
and Princes. But when I ſaw by this cleare doctrine my ugly ſhape
of a diſloyall, diſobedient and trecherous monſter, nouriſhed with
the venemous and poyſoned milk of the <hi>Whore of Babylon,</hi> which
teacheth her <hi>Popes</hi> to be above all Temporall Princes, and no wayes
bound to pay them tribute; O how would I fly and fling like a Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ky
at the Chriſtall glaſſe of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> doctrin, that thus repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
unto me mine own monſtrous ſhape. O when I uſed to read &amp;
ſtudy the grounds of the Popiſh Tranſubſtantiation, and found them
groundleſſe, ſaying, that one body may be in 2 places, nay in a 1000.
And upon that ſalfe ground proving that Chriſts body may be real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
preſent in the Sacrament in a thouſand places at one time, &amp; at the
ſame time alſo in Heaven: How clearely did I ſee the contrary in
the Chriſtall glaſſe of our Churches doctrine? For if Chriſts body
being a naturall and phyſicall body can be at one time in ſeverall pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
then at one time alſo it may be ſubject to ſeverall and contrary
accidents, it may bee hot and cold at once, for it may bee
in a hot and cold place at one time, it may bee alſo ſtabbed
in one place (as the <hi>Papists</hi> confeſſe it hath been by <hi>Jews</hi>) and in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
place at the ſame time it may not be ſtabbed; ſo then 2 contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictories
<hi>ſimul &amp; ſemel</hi> are true, and truly verified of the ſame body,
It is ſtabbed and it is not ſtabbed. Alſo in one place it may bee
be gnawn and devoured by vermin, mice or worms: and in another
place at the ſame time it may not be gnawn: As my ſelf can witnes,

who ſaying Maſſe one day in the <hi>Weſt Indias,</hi> in a town called <hi>Porta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,</hi>
6 years ago, after I had conſecrated the Bread or Wafer hoſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Altar, making a ſhort mentall prayer with mine eyes ſhut,
which they call <hi>the Memento for the Dead,</hi> ſuddainly came upon the
Altar a Mouſe, and ſtole away the Sacrament. I opening mine eyes,
and miſſing it before me, began to be troubled, and looking about on
one ſide, I ſaw the vermin running away with the Bread. I ſtirred
up the people of the Church, who running to me cauſed candles to be
lighted, and with another Prieſt ſearched all the holes that were in
the wall behind the Altar, and at laſt found the Sacrament gnawn,
and halfe eaten up. The halfe part of it the Prieſt tooke out and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
it to the Altar in Proceſſion, lifted it up to be adored, with
knocking of breaſts by the common people. Behold here according
to the damnable doctrin of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> Chriſt's body is gnawn by a
creature, and it is not gnawn; for they ſay that the body of Chriſt is
truly and really <hi>tetus in toto &amp; totus in qualibet parte,</hi> all in all, and all
and whole in every little part. Then if this be true, Chriſt was whole
and entire in that part which was devoured, and he was alſo whole
and entire in the part which was left; ſo he was eaten and gnawne,
and he was not eaten and gnawne. Here are two contradictories
truly verified at one time againſt the light of reaſon and phyloſophy:
Beſides the abſurdity which followeth, that Chriſt ſhould leave his
body to be ſo devoured by vermin and dumb beaſts All theſe abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities

to the truth, &amp; having met here with a learned Treatiſe of one Maſter
<hi>Stephen Vaſſall</hi> againſt this damnable doctrin of Tranſubſtantiation,
which he directed to one Miſtris <hi>Bury</hi> a Gentlewoman, ſeduced and
blinded by a <hi>Popiſh Prieſt;</hi> I took upon me for ſome worldly and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
reſpects to ſome friends, to anſwer his learned grounds and

I well perceived the ugly and monſtruous ſhape of mine own
idolatrous and defiled ſoule; Yet did I fling and fly at the glaſſe like
a Monky. Why? Becauſe I was blinded by Satan, the window of
my ſoule was rammed up by the Devil, that no light might enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:124762:17"/>
it. I have been that falſe and diſobedient Prieſt <hi>Balaam,</hi> ſo blind
that I would not ſee the dangers of my ſoule neere 40 yeares: But
though the ſword of Gods Iuſtice hath-beene drawne againſt me,
though his bow hath been bent to kill me, and many inſtruments of
death prepared againſt me, yet would <hi>I</hi> wilfully run on my ways to
curſe the good and elect People of the Lord, to oppoſe the true, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient

of the me cies of God, of the glory of Heaven, of the paines
of Hell: Yet all this I have heard as a Play and ſport of paſtime, not
hearing it with my ſoule inwardly, but only with my outward
eares. I have heard that for God we muſt leave all in the world,
both kindred, father, mother, preferments and wealth: yet I would
not heare this to any purpoſe: I was loath to forſake all my kin<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

had from them, and now muſt loſe it: I was loath to ſee my ſelfe in
want and poverty. O I knew, my kinred and beſt friends would
cry out, ſhame upon me, and would threaten to kill me: All theſe
worldly and temporall reſpects ſhut up my eares and made me deaſe
againſt the truth, which teacheth that it is better to live here in
want and poverty, than to broyle for ever in Hell; that it is better
to forſake here and abandon all fleſh and blood, Brothers, Siſters, and
Kinred, than to go with them to everlaſting paines and torment.</p>
            <p>Chriſt himſelfe teacheth us that we muſt not feare them that can
hurt out bodies, but can do no harme at all unto our ſoules, and that
we muſt feare only him that can caſt our ſoules into the fire of Hell.
This it is, O Lord! which now maketh me feare; thy might, thy

away to much love of worldly pelſe.</p>
            <p>O Lord I for thy ſake I hate and leave this day that meanes, which

               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:124762:17"/>
O Lord! I know they threaten my deſtruction, but into thy hands

            <p>Now, dearely Beloved, I have diſcloſed unto you the miſeries of a
wretched ſinner; the cruelty and unſatiable tyranny of Satan over
thoſe that he ſifts away from the fruitfull granes of Chriſt's Church;
I have diſcovered unto you the heavy blows he giveth them, and
have made my ſelf a Preſident of ſo miſerable and wretched an eſtate.

might ſift him as wheat, Chriſt comforted him preſently, ſaying,
<q>But I have prayed for thee that thy faith faile not:</q>

the mercies of God are able to relieve us: And God himſelfe would
not be mercifull and omnipotent, if any miſeries of ours, (how great
ſoever) ſhould prevaile or exceed the power of his mercies: Nay
when by ſin we are moſt wretched and moſt forlorn, then doth God
ſhew moſt the power of his ſweet and comfortable mercies, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteth
not 40 only, but a 1000 yeares ill ſpent in ſin and iniquity, as

that they ſhall ſeeme but as one day ill ſpent; for God is
mercifull and will make the leaſt that may bee made of
our ſinnes, if from our hearts wee turn unto him. Nay when
moſt we offend him, then chiefly doth he ſtrive with his mercies to
allure us unto him. By the greatneſſe of his mercies he ſtriveth to
ſhew himſelfe our God and Saviour, as I have obſerved in that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
which he ſent unto <hi>John</hi> in the 11 of <hi>Mat.</hi> where <hi>John</hi> ſent two

their ſight, and the lame walke, the lepers are cleanſed, and the deaf
heare, the dead are raiſed up, and the poore have the Goſpel preached unto
them.</hi> The only way to know that Chriſt is a Saviour, is by ſeeing
his works of mercy, either Spirituall or Corporall; for by the blind
which he corporally and ſpiritually cureth, by the leprous ſoules and
bodies which he cleanſeth, by the deaf to whom he reſtoreth corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
and ſpirituall hearing, by the dead in ſoule and body whom he
raiſeth up; he is ſufficiently known to be a true <hi>Meſſias,</hi> a true Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
a moſt loving and mercifull Father. And much more by uſing
theſe mercies, when leaſt we deſerve them, when furtheſt we are
from him, when moſt grievouſly we offend him; for then it is that
he ſtriveth with the power of his mercy, to prevaile againſt the
power of Satan. In the 12 <hi>Chap.</hi> of <hi>Matth.</hi> 14. &amp; 15 <hi>verſes,</hi> this may

then doth he? Read forward the 15. <hi>verſe,</hi> and ye ſhall ſee what he
doth, <hi>And when Jeſus knew it he withdrew himſelfe from thence, and
great multitudes, followed him, and he healed them all.</hi> When moſt they

him, than doth he moſt mercifully cure and heale the lepers and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes

comfortably unto her.</hi> She ſhall not thinke that her wickedneſſe can
be greater than my mercies: When ſhe moſt flies from me, then will

               </gap>er and wooer, when his miſtris
moſt diſdaineth him, wooeth her more, allureth her with faire and
courteous promiſes. Even ſo doth God with a Soule, when we fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
moſt the vices of our heart, the vanities of the world, ſeeking to
pleaſe our ſenſes and bellies, more than the Lord, diſdaining and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning
our God and Maker; then doth he wooe our Soules, then
doth he allure them, then doth he bring them into the wilderneſſe
from all occaſions of pride, of ſelfe-love, of vanities and pſtimes:
There when he hath got them from the worldly pleaſures, doth he
ſpeak comfortably unto them. O Soule! ſaith he, why doſt thou
follow any lovers but me? there is none loveth thee better than my
ſelfe: I have beſtowed more upon thee than any adulterous lover of
thine. The beauty of thy face which thou ſo much eſteemeſt, is my
guift. The dainties of fowle and fiſh, which ſo voluptuouſly thou
beſtoweſt upon thy belly, I firſt beſtowed them upon thee. The
riches of pearles, rubies, rings and diamonds, wherewith thou ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
thy ſelfe ſo faire an object to thy lovers eye, are all my gifts. The
flowers of all ſorts and beſt perſumes, wherewith thou delighteſt ſo
much thy ſenſes, I gave them to thee. Why then deare Soule, doſt
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:124762:20"/>
thou turne from me? Why doſt thou ſhun me for other lovers?
They carry thee to perdition, but I to bliſſe and happineſſe; They
ſeek thy paines and torment, I thy reſt and glory: They fall away
like a flower which to day is, and to morrow will not be, but I ſhall
remaine for ever.</p>
            <p>Thus, O dearly Beloved, doth God ſpeake comfortably to a Soulel
thus doth he allure her, thus doth he woo and entice her, thus doth
he, when furtheſt ſhe flys from him, diſcover the riches of his
mercies to her. An ancient Doctor called <hi>John Raulinus Cluniacex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi>

Vpon theſe words, <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> groundeth great admirations, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring

hardned <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> heart, and <hi>Moſes</hi> after many wonders ſhewed

if this Countrey was firſt ſo rebellious againſt God himſelf and his

and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand of our Saviour to <hi>Peter,</hi> contained in thoſe words;
<q>And when thou art converted, ſtrengthen thy Brethren.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Peter</hi> did, and this all they are bound to do, who are truly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
from ſin and from a wicked eſtate to the true knowledge of
Gods Laws. True it is <hi>Peter</hi> did fall, and did moſt cowardly thrice
deny his Maſter: But after our Saviour looked upon him, and with
one look turned his heart, then <hi>Peter</hi> went out and wept bitterly.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:124762:21"/>
And he did not only weep and repent within himſelfe, but moſt zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly
endeavoured to ſtrengthen his Brethren, as you may obſerve
<hi>Acts</hi> 2. when having received the Holy Spirit himſelfe, he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
couragiouſly unto the <hi>Jews</hi> to convert them and ſtrengthen them
in the true Faith, as you may read from the 14<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. to the 38 <hi>verſe,</hi> and
forward, where publickly he ſaid unto them, <hi>Repent and be baptized
every one of you in the name of Jeſus Christ, for the remiſſion of ſins, and
you ſhall receive the gift of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> O he was a true converted
man, and thought he muſt not be contented to be himſelfe conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
only, but that he was bound to convert and ſtrengthen others. So
did <hi>Saul,</hi> who had been ſo great a Perſecutor, when he was truely
converted, preſently he ſtrived to do good to others, as you may
read <hi>Acts 9. 19, 20. verſes, And when he had received meat, he was
ſtrengthned. Then was Saul certaine dayes with the Diſciples, that were
at Damaſcus; And ſtrait way he preached Chriſt in the Synagogue, that
he is the Son of God.</hi> And further in the 22 <hi>ver. But Saul increaſed the
more in ſtrength, and confounded the Jews that dwelt at Damaſcus, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
that this is very Chriſt.</hi> Behold how this converted Apoſtle is
not ſatisfied with his own converſion, but preſently burneth with
an inward zeale of communicating unto others that good which he
had received from God by his Converſion. Your Divines ſay, that
<hi>Bonum est diffuſivum ſui,</hi> that which is truly good in it ſelfe, is with
a natu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>all inclination to impart it ſelfe, yea prodigally to pou<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e it
ſelf out to others. This doctrin alſo <hi>David</hi> teacheth us in his 51 <hi>Pſal.</hi>
where he repenteth himſelf for the Adultery which he had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and having begged of God, that he would create in him a clean
heart and renew a right ſpirit within him, <hi>Then</hi> ſaith he in the 13
<hi>verſe, will I teach tranſgreſſors thy ways, and ſinners ſhall be converted
unto thee.</hi> Lo how <hi>David</hi> doth not only repent himſelfe, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
his converſion by words of ſorrow and bitter compunction, but
promiſeth God, that he will ſtrengthen others, by teaching them
the ways of God, that alſo they may come to be converted.</p>
            <p>In the firſt Chapter of the <hi>Canticles</hi> ver. 4. You ſhall find a few
words eaſy in this ſenſe, but hard to be underſtood in any other,
where the Spouſe ſpeaking to her Beloved, ſaith, <hi>Draw me, we will
run after thee; The King hath brought me into his Chamber, we will be
glad and rejoyce in thee; we will remember thy love.</hi> Me thinkes, the
Spouſe ſhould have ſaid, <hi>draw me,</hi> I will run after thee, <hi>The King hath
brought me into his chamber.</hi> I will be glad, I will remember thy love.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:124762:22"/>
If one be drawn, why do many in the plurall number run? If one be
brought into the Kings chamber, Why be many glad and rejoyce?</p>
            <p>O dearely Beloved, it is to teach us how we ought to be have our
ſelves, when we are truly converted. The Spouſo ſignifieth a ſoule
wedded by Faith to God the true and heavenly Bridgroome; The
Chamber whereinto this foule is brought, is the true Church. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if one Soule be drawn by God, many muſt run after this one, if
one Soule be brought into the true, Ancient and Apoſtolike Church,
many muſt be glad and rejoyce. Why? B<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cauſe we muſt not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
to be drawn alone from our iniquities, we muſt not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
to be brought alone into the Church; we muſt alſo draw o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
we muſt make others alſo rejoyce by ſtrengthning them, by
teaching them, by converting them by our words, works and good
example. This is the command and precept of our Saviour to <hi>Peter,</hi>
in the words of my text,
<q>And when thou art converted, ſtrengthen thy Brethren.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand of Chriſt, I that am this day converted &amp; brought into
the Heavenly Bridgrooms chamber, into his true Church, muſt alſo
obey. O I muſt not be contented to be drawn alone, I muſt be the
cauſe that many may run after me. This, dearely Beloved, I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
to performe already, having brought one from the ſnares of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,</hi>
&amp; ſtrengthned one ſoule in the true <hi>Proteſtant</hi> &amp; Apoſtolik Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of this Kingdom. This by the Grace of God, both by preaching,
writing and printing, I will endeavour all my life to performe by
diſcovering and laying open to the world thoſe Rocks and quicke
ſands of <hi>Popiſh</hi> doctrin, whereupon ſo many ſoules do run and are
dayly caſt away by the ignorance of fooliſh and unskilfull Pilots O
dearely beloved! never were you in greater danger than at theſe
times; for in <hi>Ireland</hi> you ſee how the <hi>Papiſts</hi> threaten us with their
erroneous doctrines; here at home they ſecretly plot to bring in
their ſuperſtitions; therefore let me warne you this day to hoyſe up
your ſailes and top maſts, and with the gale of that heavenly Spirit,
of that Divine blaſt ſave your ſoules from being ſplinted upon theſe
Rocks of <hi>Popiſh</hi> ſuperſtition from being ſwallowed up with the
quick ſands of Antichriſtian doctrin. O beloved abhor all your lives
the chief and principall point of all <hi>Popery,</hi> which is that falſe autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
that Supremacy which the <hi>Papiſts</hi> give to the <hi>Pope</hi> above all the
Church, O never admit this erroneous doctrin, nor ever thinke that
Chriſt left <hi>Peter</hi> or any other to be Supream head, and only head over
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:124762:22"/>
the Church, but this authority was given equally to all the Apoſtles
as ye may gather out of <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. &amp; 3 laſt <hi>ver.</hi> where our Saviour e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
and with equall authority ſent all his Apoſtles to preach and
teach, ſaying, <hi>Go ye therefore and teach all Nations.</hi> And further he
ſaith, <hi>And loe I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
how Chriſt ſendeth not only <hi>Peter,</hi> but all his Apoſtles to preach
and teach: And ſaith he will bee not only with <hi>Peter,</hi> but with all
his Apoſtles inſpiring ſpiritually and inſtructing them all, and not
<hi>Peter</hi> alone, to rule and governe &amp; feed with ſpirituall food his flock.
If this be ſo, dearly Beloved, never beleeve that the authority which
the <hi>Pope</hi> challengeth to himſelf over all the Church is due unto him,
who uſurpeth his authority &amp; ſeeketh by it to encroach upon Kings
and Princes Crowns, as I ſhall in ſome other occaſion more largely
declare. Fly therefore deare ſoules from this chief and moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Rock of all <hi>Popery;</hi> and having once diſcovered the dangers
of this falſe doctrin, abhor then all other erroneous doctrins of <hi>Rome,</hi>
which come from him that uſurpeth Chriſts own power, and chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengeth
it to himſelfe alone. O let my converſion be your ſtrength
and comfort! O beleeve an experienced and skilfull Pilot, who hath
travailed almoſt over all the world, and hath by experience of almoſt
40 yeares diſcovered all thoſe rocks and quick ſands of <hi>Popiſh</hi> errors
of Antichriſtian doctrines and ſuperſtitions, which threaten the
loſſe and utter overthrow of your ſoules. O that this day I may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
what Ieſus ſaid to <hi>Peter,</hi>
               <q>And when thou art converted, ſtrengthen thy Brethren.</q>
            </p>
            <p>O let my example, dearely Beloued, ſtrengthen you all in the true
<hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> that ſo I may ſay with the ſpouſe, <hi>draw me and we
will run,</hi> that I being drawn this day unto the true Faith, yee may all
run more haſtily and ſpeedily to the ſame; that I being brought this
day into the Kings chamber, that is, into the true Church, ye may all
be glad and rejoyce, finding in your ſoules a new &amp; greater ſtrength
to continue and dye in this ancient and Apoſtolike Church, that ſo
we may all meet and rejoyce together after this life in another cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of our Heavenly Bridegroome, in the triumphant Church of
Heaven. <hi>Amen.</hi>
