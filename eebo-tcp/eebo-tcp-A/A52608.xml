            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>CONSIDERATIONS on the Explication of the Doctrine of the Trinity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>SIR, 'tis the principal Design of both Testaments, by Confession of all Parties, to estabish the Worship and Belief of <hi>one only God;</hi> 'twas for this that all the Books of the <hi>Old</hi> Testament were written, and delivered to the Jews; and for this the <hi>New</hi> was bestowed on the Gentiles.</p>
            <p>Of Jews and Gentiles, as the Apostle ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves, <hi>There were none that understood, none that sought after</hi> (the true) <hi>God: They were all gone out of the way; they became vain in their Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and their foolish Heart was darkened: Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing to be wise, they became Fools; and changed the Truth of God into a Lie, by worshipping the Creature, and doing Service to them who were not by Nature Gods.</hi> This was the Condition of both Jews and Gentiles, when first <hi>the Law,</hi> and then <hi>the Light of the glorious Gospel of Christ, who is the Image of God, shone out upon them.</hi> In the Law, the Jews were charged, <hi>Ye shall have no other Gods but ME:</hi> and again, <hi>Thou shalt know no other God but ME.</hi> In the Gospel the Gentiles are taught, <hi>There is one God, and there is none other but He: There is no other God but one; God is one.</hi> Exod. 20. 3. Hosea 13. 4. Mark 12. 32. 1 Cor. 8. 5. Gal. 3. 20.</p>
            <p>These and an hundred more such like, <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>express</hi> Declarations of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, have been the occasion, that the Unity of God, or that there is but one God, is the <hi>first</hi> Article of Faith, both with Jews and (true) Christians. From the Christians and Jews, it hath been learned and embraced by all the Mahometans, and is now the general Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief even of the Pagan and Idolatrous Nations: for tho these last own and worship many Gods, yet they (commonly) own but one who is <hi>Supream, Infinite, Almighty</hi> and <hi>Pre-eternal;</hi> they make the other Deities to be but the <hi>Ministers</hi> of <hi>his</hi> Providence and Will, and their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators with <hi>Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that there is <hi>an</hi> Almighty and All-wise <hi>Mind,</hi> the Maker of Heaven and Earth, and of all the Creatures and Kinds in them, we discern plainly by the <hi>Order, Beauty</hi> and <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi> of Things; and more especially, by the admirable <hi>Designs</hi> in the <hi>Whole,</hi> and in all the <hi>Parts</hi> of the Creation: But as this Divine Beauty and Order, and those numberless and most useful Designs, Aims and Ends seen in the Creation, do evince that there is a Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Designing and All-powerful <hi>Mind,</hi> whom we call GOD; so they no way intimate to us, that there is more than one <hi>Creating</hi> and <hi>Governing</hi> Mind, or GOD. They demonstrate to us (beyond exception) that <hi>one</hi> such Mind there is, but not that there is more than one: therefore we may say, that we can own and worship but <hi>one</hi> such Mind, or but one God, <hi>because we know of no more.</hi> Of <hi>one</hi> we are certain, by the <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Design</hi> of the Parts in the World: of more than one, we have no manner of Proof; therefore we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not own, or worship, or but talk, or even think of more.</p>
            <p>But the Revelation made to us in holy Scripture is Categorical, Apodictical, Express and Direct: there we are told plainly, and in terms, <hi>There is no other God but one; there is one God, and there is none other but He; the Lord thy God, the Lord is one; God is one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As this Doctrine is so clearly delivered in Scripture, so <hi>good</hi> Christians have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63367:3"/>
very jealous; that neither directly nor indirectly, neither in express Words nor in Consequence, any thing should be said or held contrary thereto. They have consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that <hi>Polytheism</hi> and <hi>Atheism</hi> are much the same thing: as 'tis much one to acknowledg, and contend for more Kings of <hi>England,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers besides King <hi>William,</hi> and to renounce or deny him to be King of <hi>England.</hi> Both the Covenants, the Old as well as the New, are between <hi>Us</hi> on the one part, and the one true God on the other part: he covenants to be <hi>our God,</hi> and our <hi>exceeding great Reward;</hi> we covenant to be <hi>his People,</hi> and <hi>his only:</hi> this Covenant is manifestly dissolved, and the <hi>Premium,</hi> or Promise of Eternal Life, annexed to our Faithfulness to this Covenant, is utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forfeited; if <hi>we</hi> take to our selves any <hi>other,</hi> besides Him with whom we are in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and who alone is true God.</p>
            <p>The Guilt of Polytheism, or of affirming more than one God, being so very great; and the Forfeiture thereby made so unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and the Unity of God being so often and so expresly delivered in holy Scripture; 'tis an amazing Circumstance, that Polytheism is not only found among <hi>Christians,</hi> but is also the more general and prevailing Belief of <hi>Christian</hi> States and Kingdoms. It is true, we all agree in the words, <hi>There is one God, and there is none other but He:</hi> but when we come to explain our selves on these words, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Majority of <hi>Modern</hi> Christians are found to affirm <hi>three</hi> Gods, and not one only.</p>
            <p>One would have thought that these words, <hi>Thou shalt have no other Gods but ME, the Lord thy God is one Lord, thou shalt know no other God but ME, there is none other God but one, God is one:</hi> I say, one would have thought these Declarations to be so plain, and so uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable, that a Question could never have arose concerning their meaning. But so it is, that there are a great many Senses given of these Words, which Senses are contrary to, and destructive of one another.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Doctrine of the Unitarians concerning God.</head>
               <p>THe first of these Senses is the Unitarian. For the Unitarians say, <hi>there is none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God but one, God is one;</hi> the plain, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious and indubitable meaning of these words is this, <hi>there is but One, who is God,</hi> or <hi>a</hi> God: One God, say they, is to be understood in the same <hi>natural, sincere</hi> and <hi>unsophisticated</hi> Sense; as when we say one Sun, one Earth, one World. When the Scriptures, say they, speak to us of so high an Object as God; when they tell us, <hi>there is one God, and there is none other but He;</hi> when they declare this Faith to be the very <hi>first</hi> of all God's Charges, or Commandments to Men; without doubt they speak without <hi>Artifice</hi> or <hi>Querk,</hi> they have no <hi>double</hi> or <hi>deceitful</hi> meaning; they don't lay <hi>Snares</hi> for us, by intending such a meaning as is contrary to the usual, the grammatical and proper Sense of the Words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There is but one God,</hi> say the Holy Scriptures; where can be the Ambiguity of such usual and plain Words? the meaning of the Terms <hi>One</hi> and <hi>God,</hi> is perfectly known to all Men; Why do we study <hi>Subtilties</hi> and <hi>Finenesses,</hi> with which to deceive our selves into Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theism, and to destroy the Simplicity of the Faith?</p>
               <p>When God says in the first Commandment; <hi>Thou shalt have no other God but Me,</hi> he speaks to all Men, to the <hi>illiterate,</hi> to the <hi>sincere,</hi> and even to <hi>Children,</hi> as well as to those who are practised in the Arts of deceiving and being deceived, by a <hi>Disguise</hi> of Words, and by <hi>captious</hi> Forms of speaking. If his meaning therefore was, there is an Almighty <hi>Father,</hi> who is God; he hath an Almighty <hi>Son,</hi> who also is a God; and besides these, there is an Almighty Spirit <hi>distinct</hi> from the other two,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:63367:3"/>
and a God no less than either of them: if (I say) this was his meaning, would he have couched it in such words as these, <hi>There is none other God but one?</hi> or in these, <hi>There is one God, and there is none other but He?</hi> or would he have said, <hi>Thou shalt have none other God but ME?</hi> Could the Wisdom of God it self find no other words but these, which are so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contrary to such a meaning, by which to express himself; and that too to those who were utterly uncapable of apprehending such a Sense in them?</p>
               <p>These are the words which God spake up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> with Thunders that shook the Earth and Heavens, <hi>I am the Lord thy God, thou shalt have no other God but ME.</hi> They tell us his meaning was, there are <hi>three</hi> Almighty, All-knowing, and Most good Persons, each of them (singly and <hi>by himself)</hi> God, and all of them jointly <hi>Creators</hi> of all things: Now who would have thought it, that this should be the meaning of <hi>no other God but ME?</hi> Without doubt, the <hi>Texts</hi> and the <hi>meaning</hi> are as far from one another, as any the most <hi>contradictory</hi> Propositions can be: and till they can remove this first Commandment out of the way, it will be impossible for Men of Sense to be of the Trinitarian Perswasion; I mean, if they be also sincere, if they suffer not themselves to be <hi>blinded</hi> by the Interests, or <hi>awed</hi> by the (vain) Terrors of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent false World. Our Opposers themselves grant, that when the <hi>Israelites</hi> first heard this Commandment, they understood it, and could <hi>then</hi> no otherways understand it, as the <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians</hi> now do, namely thus, <hi>Thou shalt never own any other Person as God, but only Me who now speak to thee.</hi> God Almighty suffered this Sense of his Words to pass current for up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of 1500 Years: But <hi>then,</hi> say they, he sent our Saviour and his Apostles to give another Sense of them; nay, a <hi>contrary</hi> Sense. The Apostles and our Saviour had it in Charge to tell us, that <hi>no other God but Me,</hi> was as much as to say, God the Father, and God <hi>his</hi> Son, and God the Holy Ghost, <hi>three</hi> Divine Persons, each of them Almighty, each of them All-knowing and most Good, and each of them God. But I verily think, had the Apostles indeed pretended <hi>this</hi> to be the Interpretation of the first Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they would not have found a single Person who would have believed or received them. For these good Men had not (nor desired) Penal Laws, Prisons, Confiscations, Deprivations, Exclusions from the common Privileges of the Society, by which to <hi>awe</hi> Mens Minds, to profess, and even to believe that <hi>black is white, and white is black.</hi> It would have been told them by all their Hearers, that the Sense of Words is <hi>unalte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable;</hi> and that even the greatest <hi>Miracles</hi> cannot authorize an Interpretation evidently contrary to the Text. If the Speaker had been only a Man, yet the Sense of his Words when actually spoken, can never be changed by any Authority whatsoever: If Heaven and Earth were <hi>miraculously</hi> destroyed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm <hi>an Interpretation</hi> that disagrees with the Natural and Grammatical Sense of the Words, it will (for all that) ever remain a <hi>false</hi> Interpretation.</p>
               <p>Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is extreamly puzled with this Difficulty; he saw plainly, that the first Commandment (and other Texts of the <hi>Law)</hi> is conceived in such words, that the <hi>Israelites</hi> could not think there were <hi>three</hi> Divine Persons, but only one Divine Person. But the Reason, saith he, of <hi>this</hi> was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the <hi>Israelites</hi> having lived long in a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion where they owned and worshipp'd <hi>many</hi> Gods; if they had been told of three <hi>Divine-</hi>Persons, (or of God the Father, God <hi>his</hi> Son, and God the Holy Ghost) they would most certainly have apprehended them to be <hi>three Gods.</hi> This, saith the Cardinal, is the Reason why the Doctrine of the Trinity was reserved to the Times of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament. <hi>Bellarm. de Christo,</hi> l. 2. c. 6. <hi>Notan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum est, Deum in vetteri Testamento noluisse pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponere Mysterium Triuitatis expresse, quia Judaei in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capaces erant, &amp; quia recens exierant de Egypto, ubi colebantur multi Dii, &amp; intraturi erant in ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram Chanaan, ubi etiam multi babebantur Dii, ne videlicet putarent, sibi tres Deos proponi colendos<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

ut cum in Novo Testamento praedicaretur, non vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deretur</hi> omnino <hi>Novum.</hi> q. d. <q>The Doctrine of the Trinity was not propounded ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly to the Jews in the Old Testament; they were uncapable of it, because coming out of <hi>Egypt</hi> where many Gods were wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped, and entering into <hi>Canaan</hi> where also many Gods were acknowledged, the Jews would have thought that <hi>three</hi> Gods had been propounded to them to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped. Nevertheless it was <hi>hinted,</hi> or <hi>shadowed</hi> to them, lest when it came to be preached in the New Testament, it should seem altogether a new thing.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In reading the Works of this Cardinal, I have often had this Thought, That provided his Works were but bulky and learned, he never cared what other Property they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: no one can deny that his <hi>five</hi> Books against the Unitarians, intituled by him <hi>De Christo,</hi> are the most <hi>learned</hi> of any that have been written against us; but they have no <hi>Wit,</hi> and are (throughout) most <hi>injudicious.</hi> What can be more unthought or silly, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, than this <hi>vain</hi> Elusion? God speaks to the Jews, saith he, as if he were but one Person, because they (living among People who acknowledged many Gods) would have mistaken <hi>three</hi> Divine Persons to be <hi>three</hi> Gods. How came it to be more safe or sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, or less liable to Misinterpretation, to instruct Christians in the Belief of <hi>three</hi> Divine Persons; than it would have been to teach the same Belief to the Jews? The Jews, saith the Cardinal, would have mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, they would have thought the <hi>Trinity</hi> (an Almighty Father, an Almighty Son, and an Almighty Spirit) to be <hi>three</hi> Almighties, and <hi>three</hi> Gods; so this Mystery was not <hi>preached</hi> to them. What a Narrowness of Thought and Consideration is implied in this Answer; for, was not the whole <hi>Christian</hi> Church taken from among such Nations, who <hi>all</hi> worshipped and owned <hi>many</hi> Gods? The Reason alledged by the Cardinal, if it were good for any thing, must also have prevented the Revelation of that (pretended) Mystery to any of the Christian Nations and Churches.</p>
               <p>I might also ask the Cardinal, why he hath so much better Thoughts of <hi>Athanasius,</hi> than of <hi>Moses,</hi> and the Prophets? <hi>Athanasius</hi> knew how to compose a Trinitarian Creed, in the most <hi>express</hi> and particular manner, that might be delivered out to all the Churches, without the least danger of lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them into any Mistake about it: but <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets, tho inspired by God, wanted this Dexterity. They, poor Men, were forced to speak (falsly) of God, as if he were but one Person, not a Trinity of Persons, lest they should commit some dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Blunder in the <hi>wording</hi> of their Doctrine, and so lay an occasion of Polytheism in the way of the Jewish Church; but <hi>Athanasius,</hi> and the Nicene Fathers have happily got over this Difficulty, they have blest the Christian Churches with a <hi>pair</hi> of Creeds, worth an hundred first Commandments.</p>
               <p>But to be short; the <hi>Unitarian</hi> Explication of the Texts, which say <hi>there is but one God,</hi> is, that <hi>there is but one who is God,</hi> or but one <hi>Divine</hi> Person, but one who is Almighty, All-knowing, and perfectly Good. Our very Opposers confess that this was the <hi>antient</hi> and <hi>first</hi> Sense of the Words, so the Faithful un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood them for 1500 Years together. They confess too, 'tis a very <hi>Natural</hi> and a very <hi>Rational</hi> Sense; that it hath no Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, no Mysteries or Monstrosities in it. They are constrained also to own, that the before-mentioned Texts alledged by the Unitarians, are so <hi>read</hi> in all Copies both of the Hebrew and Greek, and can no other ways be <hi>rendred</hi> from the <hi>Original</hi> Text; or more clearly thus, as to these Texts there is no Variety or <hi>Difference</hi> in the <hi>reading,</hi> in the Copies of the <hi>Original,</hi> nor any <hi>Uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi> in the <hi>Translations</hi> of those Copies. This is a very great matter, and cannot be said, nor is so much as pretended, for the Texts are urged by Trinitarians; they have been often challenged to produce but one Text for their Doctrine of the Trinity: but either 'tis otherwise <hi>read</hi> in the most Antient and Eminent Copies of the Greek and Hebrew, or 'tis easily and naturally render'd and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:63367:4"/>
                  <hi>translated</hi> to another Sense; or 'tis given up by their own (ablest) Interpreters and Criticks, as wholly impertinent, and no Proof of the Doctrine in question. From these confest and acknowledg'd Premises, we have these two necessary and unavoidable Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences. 1. That the Account which the Unitarians give of God, and his Unity, is <hi>the very Voice of Nature and Reason,</hi> supported by such Texts of holy Scripture, as have neither <hi>Uncertainty</hi> nor <hi>Ambiguity.</hi> 2. That the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitarian Faith is at best but precarious, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain and doubtful; because it is not only disclaimed by Reason, but it hath no other Scripture-Proofs but such, concerning which there is no Certainty, either how they are to be <hi>read</hi> in the Originals, or how they are to be <hi>translated</hi> from the Originals into the Modern Languages. No Faith or Doctrine whatsoever can be more certain than the Proofs are on which 'tis grounded: if those Proofs are of <hi>suspected</hi> Authority and Credit, or of <hi>uncertain</hi> meaning and sense, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine it self must be altogether uncertain, suspicious and precarious. But because you expect from me a Letter, not a Volume, I will say no more now of the <hi>Unitarian</hi> Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis, but will briefly (as I can) compare and consider the Hypotheses, or <hi>Explications</hi> advanced by our Opposers.</p>

                  <hi>Of the Explication by Dr.</hi> J. Wallis.</head>
               <p>ALL Men know, that the Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Unitarians and their Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers the Trinitarians, is (in few words) this, Whether there be more than one <hi>Divine</hi> Person, or more than one Person, who is true and most High God? The Unitarians say there can be but one Divine Person; because, not to mention the Scripture-Proofs of it, <hi>a Divine Person</hi> being as much as to say <hi>a Divinity,</hi> or a God; if you say, there are more Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, you <hi>therein</hi> and <hi>thereby</hi> say there are more Gods. As three <hi>Angelical</hi> Persons are three <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> and three <hi>Human</hi> Persons are three <hi>Men:</hi> so three <hi>Divine</hi> Persons in Grammar and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Sense, are three <hi>Divinities;</hi> which (all grant) is as much as to say <hi>three Gods.</hi> So they. But, saith Dr. <hi>Wallis,</hi> 
                  <q>Here's a reasoning why 'tis grounded on this silly Mistake, that a <hi>Divine</hi> Person is as much as to say a <hi>Divinity,</hi> or a God; when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a <hi>Divine</hi> Person is only a <hi>Mode,</hi> a Respect, or Relation of God to his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. He beareth to his Creatures these three Relations, Modes, or Respects, that he is their <hi>Creator,</hi> their <hi>Redeemer,</hi> and their <hi>Sanctifier:</hi> this is <hi>what</hi> we mean, and <hi>all</hi> we mean, when we say God is <hi>three Persons;</hi> he hath those three Relations to his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and is thereby no more three Gods, than he was three Gods to the Jews, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he calleth himself the God of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> the God of <hi>Isaac,</hi> and the God of <hi>Jacob.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Three <hi>Human</hi> Persons, say the Socinians, are <hi>tres Homines,</hi> or <hi>three Men,</hi> and three <hi>Angelical</hi> Persons are three <hi>Angels;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore three <hi>Divine</hi> Persons are, in Grammar and common Sense, three <hi>Divinities,</hi> or Gods: Where, I pray, did they learn this Stuff? Not from <hi>Tully;</hi> that learned Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and great Master and Director of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant and proper speaking, would have taught them, that <hi>an Human Person</hi> is not as much as to say <hi>Homo,</hi> or <hi>a Man,</hi> but is a <hi>Qualification,</hi> a <hi>Capacity,</hi> a <hi>Respect,</hi> or <hi>Relation</hi> of one Man to other Men. <hi>n<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>o unus tres Personas,</hi> saith <hi>Tully;</hi> i. e. <hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but one Man do sustain</hi> (or am) <hi>three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, that of my self, that of my Adversary; and that of a Judg.</hi> See here, one Man sustains (or <hi>is)</hi> three <hi>Persons,</hi> an Advocate, an Accuser, and a Judg, without being three Men: Why should it be thought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible, or harsh, to say with the Church,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:63367:5"/>
three Divine Persons are but one God, when <hi>Tully</hi> maketh those <hi>three other Persons</hi> to be but one Man?</q>
               </p>
               <p>This is the Sum of what Dr. <hi>Wallis</hi> hath said in <hi>eight</hi> printed Letters, and in <hi>three</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons that were preached to the University of <hi>Oxford.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sermons that have been preached to the University, and not censured by them, must be supposed to contain nothing <hi>Heretical,</hi> no nor Dangerous, Scandalous, or Heterodox. But besides that these Sermons have passed so great a Test, as that of the University of <hi>Oxford,</hi> the Doctor assureth us, that he hath been thank'd and complemented, in a great number of private Letters, on account of his Sermons and Letters: some of these Letters written to him have been published; and it doth appear, they were indeed written by able Men. We must also take notice of two other Considerations in favour of these Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Sermons of Dr. <hi>Wallis:</hi> the first is, that Dr. <hi>Sâ€”th</hi> (Author of the Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions on Dr. <hi>Sherlock)</hi> having taken particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar notice of the Letters written <hi>by</hi> and <hi>to</hi> Dr. <hi>Wallis,</hi> speaks respectfully of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of them, calling them <hi>Reverend</hi> and <hi>very Learned</hi> Persons, without making the least Reflection on his Doctrine, as Heretical, or as Heterodox. The second is, Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> himself, tho Dr. <hi>Wallis</hi> had <hi>expresly</hi> said in his Answer to <hi>W. I.</hi> that Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi>'s Doctrine doth imply <hi>Tritheism,</hi> and that so much had been proved upon him by <hi>W. I.</hi> yet does Dr. <hi>Sherlock,</hi> who is so little wonted to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Coals, pass by this Affront and Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which no Clergy-man ought to bear; nay he even fawns upon the <hi>Oxford</hi> Doctor, in his late Answer to <hi>the Stander by.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But a very surprizing thing hath happened; Dr. <hi>Wallis</hi> writes in Defence of the Trinity and the Athanasian Creed; his Explications are allowed by the University of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and even applauded by great numbers of Learned Men who profess to be Trinitarians: and yet after all, the Socinians in their <hi>Observations on the Letters of Dr.</hi> Wallis, profess that they are of his Mind; they even say, that in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of him they are content to be called <hi>Wallisians.</hi> This is very odd; for it follows, that either the Socinians are the true <hi>Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox,</hi> and their Opposers <hi>Tritheists;</hi> or else, that <hi>this good Doctor is a Socinian, and knows it not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Those that say, without doubt the Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians understand their own Doctrine, are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry picquant upon Dr. <hi>Wallis;</hi> they pretend themselves very desirous to be informed, what might be in the Doctor's Mind, to apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logize for the Athanasian Creed and the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and yet to asperse at the same time his own Patriarch <hi>Socinus,</hi> and his dear and close Friends and Brethren the Unitarians; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in such an hainous manner as we see in his <hi>third</hi> and <hi>fourth</hi> Letters. They say, either the Man is <hi>Wood,</hi> or he has written after that fashion, only to give occasion to the Socinians, as in effect it also happened, to appear more bright, by a thorow and unanswerable Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of themselves: for so it is, that wronged Innocence and Vertue are rendred more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous and lovely, when injurious Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies are wiped off.</p>
               <p>They say farther, that 'tis not to be much regarded that so many have complemented Dr. <hi>Wallis</hi> for his Letters; for what Assurance have we that the Writers of them are not secret Socinians, and that they only <hi>banter</hi> the good Doctor? As for the University of <hi>Oxford,</hi> to whom these Sabellian and Unita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Sermons were preached, 'tis very usual for the <hi>old</hi> Men that preside in that Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, to sleep at Sermons, especially at <hi>dull</hi> ones. But you are not to think, say they, that these Sermons or Letters were ever <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed</hi> to the Press by the University; or that the Doctors there understand so little, as to mistake a disguised Sabellianism or Socinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism, for the Trinity of the Catholick Church.</p>
               <p>The <hi>three</hi> Persons, says Dr. <hi>Wallis,</hi> are but three Relations, Capacities, or Respects of God to his Creatures; he is their <hi>Creator, Redeemer</hi> and <hi>Sanctifier;</hi> and in this Sense of the word <hi>Person,</hi> God is <hi>three</hi> Persons. But then because God hath also the Capacity or
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:63367:5"/>
Relation of a <hi>Judg,</hi> and of an <hi>Oeconomus,</hi> or <hi>Provider,</hi> and many more; we must not say that God is only <hi>three</hi> Persons, he is <hi>five</hi> at the least, besides I know not how many more.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, this new-fangled Socinian or Sabellian has introduced a Trinity of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Persons; that were but of <hi>yesterday.</hi> The Churches Trinity are all of them from all Eternity; <hi>Co-eternal,</hi> saith the Athanasian Creed; <hi>before all Worlds,</hi> saith the Nicene Creed: but Dr. <hi>Wallis</hi> his three Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, the first of them begins with the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the second is no older than the <hi>Crucifixion</hi> of our Saviour; for God was not <hi>a Creator</hi> before he created any thing; nor <hi>a Redeemer,</hi> till those words were spoken by our Saviour on the Cross, <hi>It is finished,</hi> i. e. The great Work of Redemption is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished.</p>
               <p>The three Divine Persons believed by the Church, begat one another after a wonderful manner: Will Dr. <hi>Wallis,</hi> being the <hi>oldest</hi> Divine of <hi>England,</hi> instruct <hi>Novices</hi> that are desirous to learn, how his Persons begat one another? How did <hi>Creation</hi> beget <hi>Redemption,</hi> and from all Eternity, that is, before either of them were; for <hi>Creation</hi> it self is but Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eval with the World: and how was Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, we must not say <hi>begotten,</hi> for that's Heresy when you speak of a <hi>third</hi> Person; but how did it <hi>proceed</hi> from Creation, and from Redemption?</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Wallis,</hi> say they, will find it as hard to account for these Difficulties, as to double the Cube, or even to <hi>square</hi> the Circle, which the most learned Mathematicians think to be impossible. He is not, say they, to think that he is Orthodox, because he hath escaped the heavy cudgelling that hath all fallen on Dr. <hi>Sherlock;</hi> 'tis not because his Doctrine, but because his Luck hath been better than that Doctor's. In a word, whereas the Church believes three real <hi>subsisting</hi> Persons, Dr. <hi>Wallis</hi> hath taught a Trinity of <hi>External Denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> or <hi>Accidental Predications</hi> only. Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Redemption and Sanctification are Acts of God's <hi>free</hi> and <hi>soveraign</hi> Will: he was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no necessity to create, to redeem, or to sanctify; they are all Effects of his most vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary and every way <hi>free</hi> Love: if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Mystery of the Trinity, so much hitherto contested, be nothing else but Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, considered as the <hi>Maker, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer</hi> and <hi>Sanctifier</hi> of his Creatures; 'tis a Trinity only of three Denominations or <hi>Names,</hi> and of <hi>Predications</hi> purely <hi>Accidental;</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that, 'tis no manner of <hi>Mystery,</hi> but the most intelligible and obvious thing in the Word; nor was it ever denied, either by Sabellians or Socinians.</p>
               <p>Thus it is, Sir, that divers learned Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons speak concerning the Trinity maintained by Dr. <hi>Wallis:</hi> I, for my part, will add no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the <hi>Observations</hi> I have formerly made on Dr. <hi>Wallis</hi> his Letters; only (I pray) take notice here with me, how well the <hi>Cadmean Brethren</hi> agree among themselves. Three Divine Persons, saith Dr. <hi>Wallis,</hi> are the three Relations of God to his Creatures; he <hi>made,</hi> he <hi>redeemed,</hi> he <hi>sanctifies</hi> them; this is the Holy Trinity. Out upon it, saith Dr. <hi>Sherlock, 'tis Nonsense and Heresy both;</hi> for the Divine Persons are three <hi>Beings,</hi> three <hi>Minds,</hi> three <hi>Spirits,</hi> all of them <hi>living, subsisting,</hi> and <hi>conscious</hi> to one another.</p>
               <p>No, no, that's as much too much, saith Dr. <hi>Sâ€”th,</hi> 'tis neither so nor so, but as I have explained it in my <hi>eighth</hi> Chapter of Animadversions on Dr. <hi>Sherlock.</hi> The Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the Trinity by Dr. <hi>Sherlock,</hi> saith Dr. <hi>Sâ€”th, is a treacherous and a false Defence of that Mystery; he hath advanced a Notion, that immediately and unavoidably infers three Gods: and if he had lived in the times of the sixth General Council, he would have incurred the Penalty of Deprivation.</hi> Pref. p. 2, 7, &amp; 8.</p>
               <p>Well, I hope Dr. <hi>Sâ€”th</hi> hath at length told us the very true Doctrine about the Trinity. Yes, he hath (without question) laid down the very Explication of <hi>the Schools,</hi> the Doctrine or Explication generally recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in <hi>Universities;</hi> I doubt not it would be approved by most of the <hi>Chairs</hi> of our Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean Universities, or Schools of Learning: he hath verily acquitted himself like a Man of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:63367:6"/>
Learning and Wit. For all that, Dr. <hi>Cud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth,</hi> in his <hi>Intellectual System,</hi> hath largely and clearly proved these two things. 1. That this Trinity of <hi>the Schools</hi> is quite different from the Trinity held by the <hi>Fathers,</hi> and that by them it would have been reckoned no other than <hi>Sabellianism.</hi> 2. That as the first Inventors of it were <hi>Peter Lombard</hi> and the Schoolmen; so it hath no other publick Authority, but that of the Fourth <hi>Lateran</hi> Council, held in the Year 1215. He saith, 'tis a gross piece of <hi>Nonsense;</hi> that it falleth not under Human Conception; <hi>neither</hi> (saith he) <hi>can it be in Nature.</hi> This is the Judgment, which this great Philosopher and Divine maketh, of the Explication propounded and defended in Dr. <hi>Sâ€”th</hi>'s Animadversions on Dr. <hi>Sherlock.</hi> And in very deed, Dr. <hi>Sâ€”th</hi>'s Explication can (fitly and properly) be called by no other Name, but <hi>an absurd Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anism,</hi> or <hi>Socinianism turn'd into Ridicule;</hi> as we shall see, when we come to consider it, in particular.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> the celebrated Author of the Ecclesiastical Polity, giveth yet another Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the Trinity; he descibeth it to be the Divine Essence, distinguished by three <hi>Internal</hi> and <hi>Relative</hi> Properties: this Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation differs as much from Dr. <hi>Wallis</hi> as any of the rest; for Dr. <hi>Wallis</hi>'s three Persons are all of them <hi>External</hi> Denominations or Predicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But these Differences, Sir, among our Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers, will appear to you most clearly, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out my needing to point at them; in the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts I am about to give, of their several Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications of their Trinity, and the Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons I shall make on them. Therefore I pass on, to the Explication given us by Dr. <hi>Sherlock.</hi>

                  <hi>Of the Explication by Dr.</hi> W. Sherlock.</head>
               <p>FOR Memory and Method's sake, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Division is so <hi>just;</hi> we may distinguish the Accounts, or Explications of the Trinity contrived by our Opposers; after this manner. There is, first, <hi>the Trinity according to Tully,</hi> or the <hi>Ciceronian</hi> Trinity; which maketh the three Divine Persons, to be nothing else but three <hi>Conceptions</hi> of God; or God <hi>conceived of</hi> as the Creator, the Redeemer, and Sanctifier of his Creatures. Dr. <hi>Wallis,</hi> after many others, hath propounded and asserted this Trinity, in his Letters, and his Sermons to the <hi>Patris conscripti</hi> at <hi>Oxford.</hi> He found in <hi>Tully, Sustineo unus tres Personas;</hi> of which he mistaketh the meaning to be, <hi>I being but one Man, yet AM three Persons:</hi> saith the Doctor hereupon; Why may not God be three Persons; as well as one Man was three Persons?</p>
               <p>The next is the <hi>Cartesian</hi> Trinity, or <hi>the Trinity according to Des Cartes:</hi> which maketh three Divine Persons, and three Infinite <hi>Minds, Spirits</hi> and <hi>Beings,</hi> to be but one God; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are mutually, and internally, and universally <hi>conscious to each others Thoughts:</hi> Mr. <hi>Des Cartes</hi> had made this <hi>Inventum</hi> to be the first Principle and Discovery in Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, <hi>Cogito, ergo sum; I think, therefore I am:</hi> and he will have the very Nature of a Mind or Spirit to consist in this, that 'tis <hi>a thinking Being.</hi> Therefore, says Dr. <hi>Sherlock,</hi> three Persons can be no otherways one God, but by Unity of Thought; or what will amount to as much, as internal and perfect <hi>Conscious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to one anothers Thoughts.</hi> Any one may see, that Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi>'s <hi>Mutual Consciousness,</hi> by which he pretends to explain his <hi>Trinity in Unity,</hi> was by him borrowed from the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations and Principles of Monsieur <hi>Des Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes:</hi> his System was hinted to him, by that unhappy Philosopher who hath razed (as much as in him lay) the only Foundation of Religion; by resolving (so absurdly, as well as impiously) the Original of the World and of all Things, not into the Contrivance and Power of an Almighty and All-wise Mind,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:63367:6"/>
but into the Natural <hi>Tendencies</hi> of Bodies, or as he calls them, <hi>the Laws of Motion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Third is <hi>the Trinity of Plato,</hi> or the <hi>Platonick</hi> Trinity; maintained by Dr. <hi>Cud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth,</hi> in his Intellectual System. This Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is of three Divine Co-eternal Persons, whereof the second and third are subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate or inferior to the first; in Dignity, Power, and all other Qualities, except only Duration. Yet they are but one God, saith he; <hi>because</hi> they are not three <hi>Principles,</hi> but only one; the Essence of the Father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Root, and Fountain of the Son and Spirit: and <hi>because</hi> the three Persons are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together under one Head, even the Father. This, saith Dr. <hi>Cudworth,</hi> is the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of <hi>Plato,</hi> and the genuine Platonists; and is the only true Trinity: all other Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians besides the Platonists, are but <hi>Nominal</hi> Trinitarians; and the Trinities they hold, are not Trinities of <hi>subsisting</hi> Persons, but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Names and Denominations only, or of partial and inadequate Conceptions.</p>
               <p>The fourth is <hi>the Trinity according to Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle,</hi> or the <hi>Aristotelian</hi> or <hi>Peripatetick</hi> Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; which saith, the Divine Persons are one God, because they have the same <hi>Numerical</hi> Substance, or <hi>one and the self-same Substance, in Number:</hi> and tho each of the three Persons is Almighty, All-knowing, and most Good; yet 'tis <hi>by one individual and self-same Power, Knowledge and Goodness, in Number.</hi> This may be called also the <hi>Reformed</hi> Trinity, and the Trinity of <hi>the Schools;</hi> because the Divines of the middle Ages, <hi>reformed</hi> the Tritheistick and Platonick Trinity of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> into this <hi>Sabellian</hi> Jargonry; as Dr. <hi>Cudworth,</hi> often and deservedly, calleth it. This is the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity intended by Dr. <hi>Sâ€”th,</hi> in his Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions on Dr. <hi>Sherlock,</hi> especially at <hi>chap.</hi> 8. The Author or first Contriver of it, was <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Lombard,</hi> Master of the Sentences, and Bishop of <hi>Paris,</hi> who died in the Year 1164. It never had any other Publick Authority, saith Dr. <hi>Cudworth,</hi> but that of the fourth Lateran Council; which is reckoned by the Papists among the <hi>General</hi> Councils, and was convened in the Year 1215. He might have added, that the Doctrine of <hi>P. Lombard</hi> was disliked and opposed by divers Learned Men, and censured by <hi>Alexander</hi> the Third, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Popes; till Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared it to be <hi>Orthodox.</hi> It may be not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probably said, that an <hi>Unitarian</hi> was the true Parent of it; for 'tis said, that <hi>Peter Lombard</hi> took his <hi>four</hi> Books of Sentences, for so much as concerneth the Trinity, out of a Book of <hi>P. Abelardus</hi> concerning the same.</p>
               <p>To this Trinity (of <hi>Aristotle</hi> and the <hi>Schools)</hi> we must reckon the <hi>Trinity of Properties;</hi> which (we shall see hereafter) is so variously ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, as to make even divers <hi>sorts</hi> of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities: yet I refer all the <hi>Property-Trinities</hi> to this fourth Distinction of Trinities, <hi>the Trinity according to Aristotle;</hi> because they are all grounded, on the abstracted or Metaphysical and Logical Notions, of that Philosopher; nor can they be understood, without some Knowledge of his Philosophy.</p>
               <p>We must add to all these, <hi>the Trinity of the Mobile;</hi> or the Trinity held by the common People, and by those ignorant or lazy Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, who in Compliance with their Lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness or their Ignorance, tell you in short, that the Trinity is an unconceivable, and therefore an inexplicable <hi>Mystery;</hi> and that those are as much in fault, who presume to explain it, as those who oppose it.</p>
               <p>I have propounded to my self, to discourse briefly on all these Trinities; I have begun with the <hi>Trinity of Marcus Tullius Cicero,</hi> or, if he pleases, of Dr. <hi>Wallis:</hi> I have said of it, as much as is necessary; the next is <hi>the Trinity according to the Philosopher Des Cartes,</hi> but the Discoverer of which is Dr. <hi>Sherlock.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> came out with his <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication,</hi> in Answer to the Brief History of the Unitarians, and the Brief Notes on the Creed of <hi>Athanasius:</hi> the more ignorant of the Doctors and Rectors, and all the young Fry of Lecturers and Readers about Town, were his Hawkers to cry it about, and cry it up. They questioned not, what such a Master in Polemicks had delivered; especially with so much Assurance and Confidence, and with so much Keenness, and Contempt of the poor
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:63367:7"/>
                  <hi>kick'd</hi> Note-maker, and Epistler. But the more learned among them, said from the very first; that indeed Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> meant honest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and he might have propounded this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to his <hi>private</hi> Friends, to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and debated: but it was liable to too many <hi>obvious</hi> Exceptions, to be published to all the World; without great Corrections, in the manner of Expression.</p>
               <p>But the Socinians presently saw their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; and resolved to make use of it: accordingly, in about <hi>four</hi> or <hi>five</hi> Weeks time, out came their <hi>Observations</hi> on the <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication</hi> of Dr. <hi>Sherlock;</hi> which in some Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of them are prefaced, with <hi>the Acts</hi> or Gests of <hi>Athanasius.</hi> Here they tell the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, that he hath published a worse Heresy, than even <hi>ours</hi> is held to be, by our bitterest Opposers; in one word, that he hath revived <hi>Paganism</hi> by such an Explication of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, as undeniably introduces Tritheism, or three Gods. They show him, that his Error was condemned by the Antients in the Person of <hi>Philoponus;</hi> and in the middle Ages in the Person and Writings of <hi>Abbat Joachim:</hi> but more severely since the <hi>Reformation,</hi> in the Person of <hi>Valentinus Gentilis;</hi> who was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned at <hi>Geneva,</hi> and beheaded at <hi>Bern,</hi> for this very Doctrine. They demonstrate to him, by a great many unexceptionable Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, that a <hi>Mutual Consciousness</hi> of three (supposed) Divine <hi>Spirits</hi> and <hi>Minds,</hi> having each of them his own peculiar and <hi>Personal</hi> Understanding, Will and Power of Action, is so far from making three such <hi>Spirits</hi> to be <hi>one</hi> God in number; that 'tis the clearest and the certainest Demonstration, that they are <hi>three</hi> Gods. Mutual-Consciousness maketh them to be a Consult or Council, a Cabal or Senate of Gods, if you will; but by no means, one <hi>Numerical</hi> God, or one God <hi>in Number.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Observations</hi> of the Socinians opened all Mens Eyes, to see and acknowledg, that Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> had greatly overshot the Mark; and that it was necessary, he should yield his Place to some new Opponent, who (in these Disputes with the Socinians) would speak more cautiously. All Endeavours therefore were used by his Friends, to perswade Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> to be quiet: and because such an Example had been made of him, they stopped a while all Sermons and other Tracts, that were going to the Press against the Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians. The Politicians among them feared the Success of a War, that in its Beginnings had been so unsuccessful: they said to one another, we need not trouble our selves with the Socinians; because being Masters of all the Pulpits, we can sufficiently dispose the People to the Orthodox Belief, without the help of <hi>printed</hi> Answers and Replies.</p>
               <p>'Tis about three Years, since these <hi>Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> on Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi>'s <hi>Vindication</hi> were made publick; and all this time, he hath very peaceably taken the Imputations of <hi>Heresy,</hi> and <hi>Paganism;</hi> tho he had said in the Preface to his Vindication, <hi>That having dipped his Pen in the Vindication of so glorious a Cause, by the Grace of God he would never desert it, while be could hold a Pen in his Hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Socinians did not design to give him any farther Trouble: but Dr. <hi>Sâ€”th</hi> not able to endure, that such Aspersions should lie at the Door of the Church; could not refrain from declaring to all the World; that the Church had suffered nothing, in the Defeat of Dr. <hi>Sherlock.</hi> He professeth, that the Charge drawn up against Dr. <hi>Sherlock,</hi> by the Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, is true; for he hath in very deed ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced an Explication of the Trinity, saith Dr. <hi>Sâ€”th, which immediately and unavoidably inferreth three Gods.</hi> Pref. <hi>p.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>It not being the Design of Dr. <hi>Sâ€”th,</hi> in his <hi>Animadversions,</hi> to prove the Truth of the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity;</hi> but only to explain or declare it, that is, to notify in what Sense and manner 'tis held by the Church: we must say, that his Performance is an accurate, and learned Work. He concerneth not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with the Socinians; but only rescues the received Doctrines of the Church, from the Misrepresentations of them by Dr. <hi>Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock,</hi> who either understood them not, or ventur'd to depart from them. Nor do we concern our selves with Dr. <hi>Sâ€”th:</hi> but whereas he is the only Writer, since the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vival
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:63367:7"/>
of these Controversies, who has indeed understood what the Church means by <hi>a Trinity in Unity;</hi> therefore we must take leave to say, and will also prove it; that this his <hi>true Explication</hi> of the Trinity, is (for all that) a great <hi>Untruth,</hi> or rather a great piece of Nonsense. Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi>'s was a Rational and Intelligible Explication, tho not a true one; 'tis not Orthodox, as Orthodoxy is reckoned since the Lateran Council: Dr. <hi>Sâ€”th</hi>'s is a <hi>true</hi> and <hi>Orthodox</hi> Explication, of what the Church intends to say; but 'tis neither <hi>Rational,</hi> nor <hi>Intelligible,</hi> nor <hi>Possible.</hi> But of that in its <hi>proper</hi> place; for I must <hi>next</hi> examine <hi>the Trinity according to Plato,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by Dr. <hi>Cudworth.</hi>

               <head>
                  <hi>Of the Explication by Dr.</hi> Cudworth.</head>
               <p>IT will be necessary, in the first place, to declare Dr. <hi>Cudworth</hi>'s Explication, more largely and clearly, than hath been yet done. In accounting for the Doctrine of the Trinity, he <hi>professeth</hi> to follow the Platonick Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers; with whom, saith he (not the <hi>Arians,</hi> as some suppose, but) the Orthodox <hi>Fathers</hi> perfectly agree. These held a Trinity of Divine Persons, Co-eternal indeed; but <hi>not Co-equal:</hi> for the Son and Spirit are inferior to the first Person, or the Father, in Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, in Authority, and in Power. They are so many <hi>distinct</hi> Substances; not one nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical Substance, as hath been taught by the School-Doctors, and the Lateran Council. For tho the Fathers said, that the three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons have but <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>same</hi> Substance, Essence or Nature; they did not mean there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>self-same</hi> Substance or Essence <hi>in Number,</hi> but the same Essence or Substance for <hi>Kind,</hi> or <hi>Nature.</hi> Because each Person of the three, is <hi>Spiritual, Eternal, Infinite, a Creator,</hi> and <hi>necessarily existent,</hi> therefore they were said by the Fathers and Platonists, to have the <hi>same</hi> Nature, Essence or Substance; and not because their Essences or Substances, <hi>Physically</hi> or Properly so called, are one and the same <hi>Physical</hi> Substance <hi>in Number.</hi> In few words; saith he, this famous Term <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantial</hi> (or <hi>of the same Substance)</hi> was never intended by the Platonists, or by the Fathers, to deny (as the Schools do) three distinct individual Essences, or to denote <hi>one Nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical</hi> Substance or Essence; but only to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify, that the Trinity believed by the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox is not made up of <hi>contrary</hi> or <hi>unlike</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, (as the <hi>Arian</hi> Trinity is) but of Persons all of them <hi>Homogenial,</hi> all of them Eternal, Spiritual and Uncreated. They that shall deny <hi>this</hi> to be the Doctrine of the Fathers, will find themselves obliged to answer to two things, which are indeed (fairly and truly) unanswerable: The first is, Why those Fathers who contend for the <hi>Homo-ousios</hi> (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantial, or of the <hi>same</hi> Substance) do yet expresly reject the <hi>Tauto-ousios</hi> and <hi>Mono-ousios,</hi> or of the <hi>self-same</hi> Substance and Essence <hi>in Number?</hi> The <hi>Tauto-ousios</hi> and <hi>Mono-ousios</hi> (or of the <hi>self-same</hi> Essence or Substance, in <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber)</hi> is the very Doctrine of the Schools and Moderns; but is denied by the Fathers, as meer <hi>Sabellianism:</hi> which invincibly proves, that by <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>same</hi> Substance and Essence they meant, not one and the <hi>self-same,</hi> or one <hi>in Number;</hi> but one for Kind, Nature or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties. Secondly, They must also satisfy the Citations of <hi>D. Petavius,</hi> and <hi>S. Curcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laeus,</hi> and these in the Intellectual System; which do all of them severally (and much more conjunctly) clearly show what the Sense of the Fathers was, about <hi>Homo-ousios,</hi> and consubstantial.</p>
               <p>It appears by this, and abundance more the like; that Dr. <hi>Cudworth</hi> had the same Apprehensions, concerning the three Divine Persons, with Dr. <hi>Sherlock:</hi> they both ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the three Persons to be as distinct and different, and as really <hi>three</hi> several
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:63367:8"/>
Intelligent <hi>Beings</hi> and <hi>Substances,</hi> as <hi>three</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are, or as <hi>Peter, James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> are. Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> saith, they are however called <hi>one</hi> God, because they are <hi>internally</hi> conscious to <hi>all</hi> one anothers Thoughts and Actions: but I do not believe, that Dr. <hi>Cudworth</hi> would have allowed so much to the Son and Spirit, as to be <hi>internally</hi> conscious to <hi>all</hi> the Thoughts and Actions of the first Person; he always speaketh of them, as every way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to the Father: he will not allow them to be <hi>Omnipotent</hi> in any other respect, but only <hi>externally,</hi> that is to say, because the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther concurreth <hi>Omnipotently</hi> to all their <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal</hi> Actions, whether of Creation or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. Dr. <hi>Cudworth</hi> desires to distinguish his Explication, from all others of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns, by this Mark; that <hi>it</hi> alloweth not the three Persons to be, in any respect but Duration, <hi>Co-equal:</hi> for (saith he) three distinct Intelligent Natures or Essences, each of them Pre-eternal, Self-existent, and <hi>equally</hi> Omnipotent <hi>ad intra,</hi> are of necessity three Gods, nor can we have any other Notion of three Gods; but if only the first Person be indeed <hi>internally</hi> Omnipotent, and the other two subordinate in Authority and Power to him, you leave then but one God, only in three Divine Persons.</p>
               <p>This is Dr. <hi>Cudworth</hi>'s Explication. Every one will readily make this Exception: he thinketh, either that there is one <hi>Great</hi> God, and <hi>two</hi> Lesser Ones; or else only the first is <hi>true</hi> God, and the other two <hi>in Name</hi> only. The Doctor foresaw, without doubt, this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection; therefore see, how he hath endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to prevent it. <hi>First,</hi> he reports some Answers of the Fathers, to this Difficulty; which Answers he expresly rejecteth. For some of them said, that the three Persons are one God, <hi>by their Unity of Will and Affection:</hi> Others said, they are one God, as all Men or all Mankind are called <hi>Homo,</hi> or MAN; namely because they All have the same <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifick</hi> Nature, or Essence, or Substance, even <hi>the Rational.</hi> For as all Men have the same <hi>Specifick</hi> Essence or Nature, which is the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional; so the Divine Persons also agree in one Nature, namely the Eternal, Spiritual and Self existent. But Dr. <hi>Cudworth</hi> confesseth, that an <hi>Union of Will and Affection</hi> is only a <hi>Moral</hi> Union, not a Physical or real <hi>Unity:</hi> and as three <hi>Human</hi> Persons would be three distinct Men, notwithstanding the <hi>Moral</hi> Union in Affection and Will; so also the three <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi> Persons will be three distinct Gods, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding such an Union in Will and Affection. As to the other, that the three Persons are but one God, by their having the same <hi>Specifick</hi> Nature or Essence; or as some call it Substance, namely because they are all of them Spiritual, Self-existent, and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eternal; he calleth it <hi>an absurd Paradox,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to common Sense, and our common Notions of things: for so <hi>all</hi> Men will be but <hi>one</hi> Man, because they have the same Specifick Essence or Nature, namely <hi>the Rational;</hi> and all <hi>Epicurus</hi> his (Extramundan) Gods will be but one God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then,</hi> he propoundeth divers other Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, which he neither approveth, nor expresly rejecteth, tho 'tis plain that he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liked them: for the Explication on which he insisteth, and which appears to be his Sense of the matter, is this that follows. The <hi>three</hi> Divine Persons are <hi>one</hi> God, <hi>because they are not three Principles,</hi> but only one; the Essence of the Father being the Root, and Fountain of the Son and Spirit: and because the three Persons are gathered together <hi>under one Head or Chief,</hi> even the Father. He adds here expresly, that if the Persons were Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate, <hi>(i. e.</hi> equal in Authority, Dignity, or Power) they should not be one, but three Gods.</p>
               <p>This is <hi>at large</hi> Dr. <hi>Cudworth</hi>'s Opinion: the short of it is; that the three Persons are as really <hi>distinct</hi> Beings, Essences, or Substances, as Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> hath imagined them to be. And as their Substances or Natures are not one, but three; so also must their <hi>Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings,</hi> and other Personal Powers and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties. The Doctors differ only in this; that Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> maketh the Unity of the three Persons in the Godhead, to consist in the <hi>Mutual-Consciousness</hi> of the Persons;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:63367:8"/>
But Dr. <hi>Cudworth</hi> in <hi>this,</hi> that the Father is both <hi>the Principle</hi> (Root or Fountain or Cause) and also <hi>the Head</hi> of the other two Persons. They neither of them believe one <hi>Numerical,</hi> but one <hi>Collective God:</hi> one God, not who is <hi>really</hi> one God, but is one God <hi>in certain Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects;</hi> as of Mutual Consciousness, or of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Cause, Principle and Head of all other Beings, and of the second and third Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Cudworth</hi> contends by a great number of very <hi>Pertinent</hi> and <hi>Home</hi> Quotations; that his Explication (I mean, that part of it which makes the three Persons, to be so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny distinct Essences or Substances) is the Doctrine of the Principal, if not of all the <hi>Fathers,</hi> as well as of the <hi>Platonists:</hi> and I (for my own part) do grant it. For I am perswaded, that no Man hath read the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, with Judgment and Application, but he must discern; that tho they do not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press themselves, in the incautelous, unwary and obnoxious Terms used by Dr. <hi>Sherlock,</hi> as neither doth Dr. <hi>Cudworth;</hi> yet the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers as much believed the three Persons are distinct <hi>Minds</hi> and <hi>Spirits,</hi> as Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> doth; all the Difference (as I said) is only this, that <hi>they</hi> and Dr. <hi>Cudworth</hi> do not use his very Terms. They do not say in express words, three <hi>Minds,</hi> or three <hi>Spirits:</hi> but <hi>the Comparisons</hi> which they use, and <hi>their Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> or Descriptions of what they mean by <hi>Persons,</hi> are such; that it cannot be questioned by any, that they apprehended the three Persons, to be three distinct <hi>Spirits, Minds</hi> and <hi>Beings,</hi> having each of them his <hi>own</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, and all other <hi>Personal</hi> Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. It is indeed apparent <hi>Tritheism;</hi> and that was the true Reason, why the Schools advanced a <hi>new</hi> Explication: but because <hi>the Schools</hi> durst not find fault with <hi>the Fathers,</hi> or seem to depart from their Doctrine; therefore what the Fathers intended of one <hi>Specifick</hi> Essence, or Nature, or Substance, <hi>that</hi> the Scools interpreted of one <hi>Numerical</hi> Substance, Nature or Essence; but of that hereafter, when we examine their Doctrine in its own place.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Cudworth</hi> being so great a Philosopher, as every one knows he was, found himself very hard put to it, what to say <hi>(colourably,</hi> and <hi>reasonably)</hi> concerning the Persons of the Trinity. He saw, that either he must say, that they are but one <hi>self-same</hi> Essence or Substance, in Number; or that they have <hi>distinct</hi> and <hi>several</hi> Substances or Essences. To say, that they are (or they subsist in) one <hi>self-same</hi> Substance or Essence <hi>in Number,</hi> is such <hi>Jargonry</hi> in Philosophy; that is to say, in the Nature and Possibilities of Things; that he never speaks of it, without a just mark of Contempt: 'tis Nonsense, saith he, and 'tis impossible; and besides that, 'tis Sabel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianism, and a Trinity not of <hi>Persons,</hi> but of <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Names.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well, shall we say then, that the three Persons are <hi>three</hi> distinct Substances; is it not plain <hi>Tritheism?</hi> No, saith the Doctor; for the Persons are not equal: the Father is both <hi>the Principle</hi> or Original, and <hi>the Head</hi> of the other two Persons; and besides that, <hi>he</hi> only is Omnipotent <hi>ad intra.</hi> But then, will some say; indeed this Explication leaveth us but <hi>one</hi> God, which is the thing we look'd after: but it is, by utterly abolishing the Godhead of the Son and Spirit; it maketh only the Father to be <hi>really</hi> God, the other two Persons are <hi>so</hi> only by a certain <hi>Dependance</hi> on him, both in Origination and Acting. As bad as this Consequence is, and as clear; Dr. <hi>Cudworth</hi> is forced to swallow it, and to sit down contented with it: he thought, it should seem, it is better somewhat to strain the use of <hi>Words,</hi> than the Natures and Possibilities of <hi>Things.</hi> 'Tis hard indeed, that we must <hi>say,</hi> one <hi>Supream</hi> and two <hi>Dependent</hi> Persons make but one God; but 'tis harder to <hi>say,</hi> three Persons have but one Substance or Essence <hi>in Number.</hi> Words are <hi>Arbitrary</hi> Signs, applied to things according as Men please, and therefore are capable of Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in their Use: but the Nature of Things is absolutely unchangeable; <hi>three</hi> Persons can <hi>never</hi> be <hi>one</hi> Substance, Essence or <hi>individual</hi> Nature. No Philosophy, but that of <hi>Gotham,</hi> will allow; that one Intelligent Substance
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:63367:9"/>
can be more than one Person: but divers Philosophers, especially the Platonists, have <hi>called</hi> three Distinct, Intelligent, Divine Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, one <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>But it is now time to make our Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on this Doctor's Explication; which I shall do the more carefully, <hi>because</hi> I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded, that all the chief <hi>Fathers</hi> were in his Sentiments, that the three Divine Persons are <hi>three</hi> distinct individual <hi>Substances</hi> or Essences <hi>in Number;</hi> which by <hi>the Schools</hi> and all the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns, is granted to be <hi>Tritheism:</hi> and because it is evident by his <hi>Intellectual System,</hi> that this Doctor understood all the Philosophies, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient and Modern, in the most perfect man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; and was himself one of the ablest Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers we have known. His Explication hath these Parts. 1. That the <hi>Divine</hi> Persons are (one <hi>Specifick,</hi> but) <hi>three</hi> distinct, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular <hi>individual Substances</hi> or Essences in Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, or in the <hi>Reality</hi> of Things: and that otherwise, there could not be <hi>three</hi> Divine Persons, but only <hi>one</hi> such Person. 2. That three distinct, individual, intelligent Divine Essences or Substances, commonly called <hi>Persons,</hi> are yet but one God; because tho they are <hi>three in Number,</hi> yet they are <hi>one in Original;</hi> for the second and third Persons are derived from the Father, as their Fountain and Cause. 3. Tho they are <hi>three</hi> Persons, yet they are but <hi>one</hi> God, because they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur to all the same Actions both of Creation and Providence, <hi>under one Head,</hi> even the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The Emphasis of <hi>this</hi> lies in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring to all the same Actions; but princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally in this, that they concur to the same Actions <hi>under one Head, which is the Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Divine Persons are three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct, particular, individual, <hi>Intelligent</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, Essences or Natures; and that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, that is, were there but one <hi>self-same</hi> Substance or Essence <hi>in Number,</hi> they should not be <hi>three</hi> Persons, but only <hi>one</hi> Person. I have granted, that if there are <hi>three</hi> Divine Persons; those Persons are (of necessity) <hi>three</hi> distinct, individual Essences or Substances: so that, as to this first Proposition, the Doctor and the Socinians are perfectly agreed; all that <hi>we</hi> deny, is, that three such Essences (or Persons) <hi>are,</hi> or <hi>can be</hi> but one God.</p>
               <p>But tho the Socinians allow, that three <hi>Persons</hi> must be three distinct <hi>Substances</hi> or Essences, yet all the <hi>Modern</hi> Trinitarians utterly deny it: the reason is, because they saw plainly, that to say there are <hi>three</hi> distinct Essences, or Substances, is to grant (in effect) to the Socinians what they so much contend for; namely that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Trinity doth imply three Gods. Three distinct Divine <hi>Persons,</hi> saith Dr. <hi>Cud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth,</hi> are three distinct Divine <hi>Essences</hi> or <hi>Substances;</hi> it is true, say the Socinians, and we grant <hi>this</hi> to the Doctor: no, say all the <hi>Modern</hi> Trinitarians, <hi>three</hi> distinct Divine <hi>Essences,</hi> are not only three distinct Divine <hi>Persons,</hi> but they are also three distinct <hi>Gods;</hi> if once we grant that the three Divine <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> are three <hi>Essences,</hi> the Socinians will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort it from us (as an unavoidable Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence) that we teach three Gods.</p>
               <p>The Truth is, since the Lateran Council, which determined in favour of <hi>P. Lombard,</hi> against <hi>Abbat Joachim</hi> and the Fathers, that there is but <hi>one</hi> only Divine Essence or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance <hi>in Number;</hi> I do not believe, there hath been any Divine of note but Dr. <hi>Cudworth</hi> and Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> and some few who may have borrowed it from them, who durst ever publish it in Writing, that there are three distinct Divine <hi>Substances,</hi> Essences or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or that <hi>every distinct Person is a distinct Substance.</hi> They all saw, that so to say, is to introduce three Gods: for if you say, there are <hi>three</hi> distinct Intelligent, Almighty, All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowing and Pre-eternal Substances, Essences or Natures; you have actually said, there are three Gods, <hi>because you can possibly give no fuller nor other Description of three Gods.</hi> If one All-knowing, Almighty Essence or Substance, is one perfect God, to whom nothing at all can be added; 'tis no better than <hi>fooling,</hi> or <hi>effrontry,</hi> to deny, that <hi>three</hi> such Essences or Substances are <hi>three</hi> Gods.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:63367:9"/>
This plain and clear Reason hath constrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the School-Divines to depart from the Explication of the Fathers; and has also ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged all the <hi>Moderns,</hi> to follow the Schools, and forsake the Fathers. Yet so, as out of good Manners, to deny that the Fathers ever held more than <hi>one</hi> Divine Essence or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance: but I have shown before, the Ground of that gross (and I doubt not, <hi>wilful)</hi> Mistake, of the Doctrine of the Fathers. But Dr. <hi>Cudworth</hi> thought, that he had found an Expedient, how he might keep <hi>sincerely</hi> to the Fathers, and yet not be guilty of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theism: for, saith he, tho there are three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Divine Essences or Substances, vulgarly called Persons; yet the second and third Persons or Essences are <hi>derived</hi> from the first; and they all concur to the same Actions, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the same Head or Principal, even the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Therefore,</p>
               <p n="2">2. To that, the second and third Persons are <hi>derived</hi> from the Father, as their Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and Cause; therefore they may be reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as one God with him. Here begins the Controversy, between the Socinians and the Doctor. They grant, that every distinct <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> is a distinct and particular <hi>Essence</hi> or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance; but they deny, that <hi>three</hi> distinct <hi>Divine</hi> Essences can be understood to be one God: Unity of Original, or that the second and third Persons are derived from the first, will not help the Doctor, no not in the least. The three <hi>Divine</hi> Essences (which are called Persons) are one God, saith this Doctor; because the second and third are <hi>derived</hi> from the first: Why doth he not say too, that three <hi>Human</hi> Essences (or Persons) whereof the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and third derive themselves from the first, are one <hi>Man?</hi> He may as well say this, and as soon perswade it, as the former: the Son and Grandson <hi>derive</hi> themselves from a first Human Essence (or Person) called the Grandfather; two Brothers <hi>derive</hi> themselves from their common Father: Doth this Unity of Original make them all to be but one <hi>Man?</hi> If not, neither can Unity of Original make the Son and Spirit one God, with their Fountain and Cause, even the Father. It is a reasoning, altogether unworthy of Dr. <hi>Cud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth;</hi> the Son and Spirit are particular Substances or Essences, derived from the Essence of the Father, as their Principle or Cause, therefore they are one God with the Father: for then, all Angels, all Men, nay and all Beasts, shall be one God with the Father, who is their Cause and Principle. Unity of Original is so far from proving, that they are one God with him; that it even <hi>demonstrates</hi> the very contrary: for if they are derived from the one true God, they themselves cannot be that one true God; no more than the <hi>Effect</hi> can be the Cause, that very Cause whose Effect it is.</p>
               <p>These Arguments are so clear, and withal so very obvious; that I wonder much, that Dr. <hi>Cudworth</hi> foresaw them not: but it may be, he foresaw them; but thought withal that even all these Consequences are better, than to admit such a Monstrosity in Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, as three Persons having only one <hi>self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same Substance in Number.</hi> All things, how hard soever, would go down with him, but only that; but that can never be agreed to, by a Philosopher.</p>
               <p n="3">3. His last Subterfuge was this; the three Divine Essences (called <hi>Persons)</hi> are but one God, because they concur to all the same Actions, of Creation and Providence, under one Head the Father, who only is Almighty <hi>ad intra,</hi> or really Almighty. How many <hi>Rarities</hi> hath he boxed up, in a very little compass? 1. Here is one <hi>Almighty,</hi> who to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with two other Persons, is one God. I would know, how two other Persons can contribute to make him a perfect God, who without them is <hi>Almighty?</hi> The Scale is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready full, if <hi>Almightiness</hi> be there; we need no more Weight: and least of all, the Weight of two <hi>Impotents.</hi> If the Son and Spirit are not <hi>Almighty ad intra,</hi> or <hi>not really</hi> Almighty, but only as the Father <hi>Omnipotently</hi> concurs with them; they are <hi>Impotent:</hi> for every Person and Thing, that is not Almighty, or cannot do <hi>all</hi> things, is impotent to <hi>some</hi> things.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:63367:10"/>
Dr. <hi>Cudworth,</hi> being so accurate a Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, saw evidently, that three <hi>Almighty</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons are (of necessity) three Gods; therefore he will admit of but one Almighty Person, even the Father. But then, he should have look'd a little further, or closer; and he would also have seen, that when he had found <hi>one Almighty,</hi> there was no need to add to him <hi>two Impotents,</hi> to make him a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat God; or (as he speaks) to make up <hi>the Intireness of the Divinity.</hi> 2. 'Tis altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as rare, strange and surprizing; that the Son and Spirit are one God with the Father, because <hi>they are gathered under him, as their Head and Principal.</hi> Doth not the Doctor <hi>prevari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate?</hi> doth he not say these things, only to establish <hi>Unitarianism,</hi> so much the more strongly? For if you say <hi>first,</hi> that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Principal,</hi> and the Son and Spirit are subjected to him; and <hi>then,</hi> therefore they are one God with the Father their Principal and Head: this, in a Man of so great Sense, looks like meer Prevarication; for 'tis plain to <hi>all,</hi> that he should have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the contrary, namely, <hi>therefore only the Father is God.</hi> We shall see the Weakness of Dr. <hi>Cudworth</hi>'s Reasoning, so soon as ever we apply it to any other Instances. The Son and Spirit are one God with the Father, saith he, because he is their Head and Principal: therefore say I, the Servants and their Master, the Subjects and their Prince, the Children and their Parent, are all <hi>one Governour;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Subjects, Servants and Children, are gathered under their Prince, their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster and Parent, as their Principal and Head. Will the Doctor allow of this <hi>(last)</hi> Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; if not, he vainly urges, or insists on the other. 3. But the Son and Spirit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur with the Father, to all the same Actions, both of Creation and Providence; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may be said to be one God with him.</p>
               <p>If the Doctor could prove, that the Son and Spirit concur to the same Acts, of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence and Creation, with the Father; he would <hi>thereby</hi> prove, that there are <hi>three</hi> Gods, not that the concurring Persons are <hi>one</hi> God. Many Carpenters, for instance, concur to make a Ship, under one Head or Principal, the <hi>Master-Builder:</hi> Many Colonels and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains concur to the marshaling of an Army under one Principal and Head, their <hi>General:</hi> Are therefore <hi>all</hi> these Carpenters, Colonels and Captains, one <hi>Master-Builder,</hi> and one <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral?</hi> That there is but one Master-Builder, and but one General, we grant; but the Captains and Carpenters, concurring with their Master-Builder and General, are not one with the General and Master-Builder.</p>
               <p>I do not think it necessary to make any further Reflections, on such impotent Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonings: I will leave it with you, Sir, to judg, Whether Dr. <hi>Cudworth</hi> hath given any <hi>new</hi> Strength to the Trinitarian Cause, by reviving an old <hi>forsaken</hi> Explication!</p>
               <p>If we will give a Name to Dr. <hi>Cudworth</hi>'s Explication of the Trinity, we must call it <hi>Mollis Arianismus, a moderate Arianism.</hi> The Arians were divided into two Parties, the high or <hi>rigid</hi> Arians, and the <hi>Ariani Molles,</hi> or the moderate Arians. The former of these (being the Eunomians and AEtians) strictly followed <hi>Arius;</hi> they believed that the Son was created by the Father, or God, but a little before the Creation of the World; and that the Spirit was the Work or Creature of the Son: and further, that their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances or Essences were altogether <hi>unlike;</hi> from whence they were also called <hi>Heterousi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> But the <hi>moderate</hi> Arians were content to say, that there was no <hi>conceivable</hi> Duration or Time, between the Being of God or the Father, and the <hi>Generation</hi> or <hi>Creation</hi> (for those are with them equivalent Terms) of the Son; the Father <hi>made</hi> or generated the Son, so early, that there was no <hi>conceivable</hi> Portion of Time before the Son was; no more than was absolutely necessary, for giving to the Father the <hi>Priority</hi> of Existence, and his Title of <hi>Father:</hi> and as to their <hi>Substances,</hi> they are <hi>Consubstantial;</hi> by which this sort of Arians meant (and the Church <hi>then</hi> meant no more) that their Substances or Essences are <hi>alike,</hi> or <hi>the same</hi> for Kind and Properties, tho not in Number; that is, the Essences of these three Persons are all of them Spiritual,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:63367:10"/>
Eternal and Infinite, tho only the Father is Infinite <hi>in Power.</hi> These <hi>moderate</hi> Arians were received to Communion by the moderate Trinitarians; and particularly by Pope <hi>Liberi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</hi> Dr. <hi>Cudworth</hi> holdeth their very Doctrine; he alloweth only the Father to be <hi>Omnipotent:</hi> and tho he saith, that the Son and Spirit are also <hi>Eternal;</hi> yet he cannot deny, that there must be some <hi>Priority</hi> of the Father, as the Fountain, Principle and Cause, before the Son and Spirit as <hi>Effects.</hi> In a word, the <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate</hi> Arians ascribed as much to the Son as Dr. <hi>Cudworth</hi> doth.</p>
               <p>Were Dr. <hi>Cudworth</hi> alive, it would not be expedient to make this Judgment of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication; but being dead, it cannot hurt him. He is retired to the true <hi>Mount Moriah,</hi> or <hi>Land of Vision;</hi> where he no longer <hi>guesses,</hi> by prudent and wary Conjectures, but he knows and even <hi>sees</hi> how these things are. God and Nature, after which he <hi>enquired</hi> with so much Application and Freedom, are now <hi>known</hi> to him: and he now rests from his excellent Labours, out of all danger from the Malevolence of the present evil Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; with whom 'tis a Crime, not to take every thing upon Trust, on the meer Credit of those who have been before us. As if it were the way to Truth; not to <hi>enquire,</hi> but to <hi>believe;</hi> not to <hi>examine,</hi> try and judg, but to <hi>pre-suppose</hi> and take for granted, every thing that has been told us, by Men in Power and Place. This is the Spirit that now prevails in the Church: and on the contrary, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous <hi>Freedom</hi> in enquiring and examining, tho it be nothing else indeed but an honest and necessary <hi>Sincerity,</hi> is now called <hi>Heresy,</hi> and <hi>Schism;</hi> and is, if you'll believe them, to be punish'd with certain <hi>Damnation.</hi> We have however, in the mean time, this Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; that it is God, who shall at last judg us: He that hath said to us, <hi>Try all things, hold fast that which is good.</hi> But I pass to the Trinity according to <hi>Aristotle,</hi> defended by Dr. <hi>Sâ€”th.</hi>

               <p>If he hath received any <hi>Personal</hi> Wrong, or Affront from Dr. <hi>Sherlock;</hi> he is the more excusable, that his Book hath so much more <hi>Scurrility,</hi> than <hi>Argument:</hi> but the Injury must have been very great, to excuse him wholly. He has noted some Errors, either of Inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertency and Haste, or of the Pen; in some Expressions and Words used by Dr. <hi>Sherlock:</hi> he imputes all these as faults of meer Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or Dulness to the Doctor. This was somewhat barbarous: nay <hi>it was</hi> more <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity</hi> in Point of Morality or Manners, than ever Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> was guilty of, in Grammar or Speech.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Sâ€”th will</hi> not (at least <hi>has</hi> not yet been able to) perswade many, that Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> wants the Qualifications, or <hi>the degree</hi> of the Qualifications, for which Dr. <hi>Sâ€”th</hi> hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served Esteem: the World thinks, there is a great deal more in Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, <hi>besides his Preferments;</hi> it is only wished, that <hi>both</hi> these Doctors had some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more of the Tenderness, and <hi>Catholick</hi> Charity of <hi>Genuine</hi> Christianity, tho it were accompanied with lesser Abilities or Learning.</p>

The Arguments used by Dr. <hi>Sâ€”th,</hi> are only <hi>Metaphysical</hi> Reasonings; easily advanced, and as easily destroyed. Dr. <hi>Sâ€”th</hi>'s is the <hi>true</hi> Explication; that is to say, as <hi>Orthodoxy</hi> is reckoned since <hi>Peter Lombard,</hi> and the Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran Council: but Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> knew it to be <hi>Nonsense,</hi> and therefore adventur'd to propose <hi>another;</hi> he put forth his Hand, to save the tottering and falling <hi>Ark,</hi> and 'tis made an inexcusable Fault. But I will pass from the too Cynical Doctor, to his Book and Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
               <p>'Tis not till <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. that he begins to bless us, with the Catholick and Orthodox Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, of his <hi>Trinity in Unity:</hi> but at length, at <hi>Pag.</hi> 240. out comes <hi>the Secret;</hi> with this Preface to it. <q>The Doctrine of the <hi>Church,</hi> and of the <hi>Schools,</hi> concerning the Blessed Trinity; so far as I can judg, but still <hi>with the humblest Submission to the Judgment of the Church of</hi> England <hi>in the Case,</hi> is this.</q> Truly, I am heartily sorry to hear it; that Dr. <hi>Sâ€”th,</hi> at these Years, has no <hi>fixed</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion <hi>of his own,</hi> no not concerning the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity it self: but is ready <hi>to turn with the Wind;</hi> is prepared to <hi>renounce</hi> a Doctrine and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, which he believes to be not only <hi>true,</hi> but <hi>Fundamental;</hi> if the Church com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands him. Mr. <hi>Milbourn</hi> makes the same Complement to his good Mother the Church, in his late Book against the Socinians; as I have noted in my Answer to him: but Mr. <hi>Milbourn</hi> is somewhat excusable, because he hath not yet received any of the Rewards, due as he thinks to his Industry and Learning; but Dr. <hi>Sâ€”th</hi> is full, and even overflows with the Blessings of the holy Mother. It should seem Dr. <hi>Sâ€”th</hi> thinketh, <hi>he hath not yet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough;</hi> else he would never be so <hi>over-mannerly,</hi> as to put his Faith it self <hi>afloat,</hi> and that too <hi>with the humblest Submission,</hi> at the Command of his Reverend Mother.

                  <q>The <hi>Personalities,</hi> by which the Godhead stands diversified into <hi>three distinct Persons,</hi> are called and accounted <hi>Modes.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for understanding the Mystery of the Trinity; we must declare, what is proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>a Mode</hi> (or Manner) <hi>of Being:</hi> It is not a <hi>Substance,</hi> nor an <hi>Accident;</hi> which two make indeed the Adequate Division of <hi>Real Beings:</hi> but a <hi>Mode</hi> is properly a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Habitude</hi> of some <hi>Being, Essence,</hi> or Thing: whereby the said Essence or Being is determined to some particular State or Condition, which, barely of it self, it would not have been determined to. And according to this Account, a Mode in things <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Immaterial</hi> hath the like Reference to such Beings, as a <hi>Posture</hi> hath to a <hi>Body;</hi> to which it gives some Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence or Distinction, without superadding any new <hi>Entity</hi> or <hi>Being</hi> to it.

As for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, <hi>Dependence</hi> is a Mode, determining the general Nature of Being to that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular State and Condition, by virtue of which it <hi>proceeds from, and is supported by another:</hi> and the like may be said of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability, Presence, Absence, Inherence, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence, and such like, <hi>viz.</hi> that they are not Beings, but Modes or Affections of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and inseparable from it so far, that <hi>they have no Existence of their own,</hi> after a Separation or Division from the Things, or Beings to which they belong.</q>

               <p>I must needs here tell you, Sir, the Story of the Princess <hi>Dulcinea del Toboso,</hi> Mistress to the Renowned <hi>Don Quixot,</hi> of the <hi>Mancha</hi> in <hi>Spain.</hi> This famous Princess had the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to be Mistress of the Affections of the so much celebrated <hi>Don Quixot:</hi> for <hi>her,</hi> he traversed Mountains, Deserts, and other <hi>dreadful</hi> Places; for her he encountred Giants, Knights-errant, and other formidable Dangers; and at length for her, to satisfy his amorous Passions towards her, he retired to a place called <hi>the poor Rock;</hi> where he spent much time in lamenting the Disdains, the Cruelty and Hard-heartedness of his Mistress towards himself, as is largely related in the History. <hi>Don Quixot</hi> was waited on in his long Travels and Adventures, by his Esquire <hi>Sancho Pancha,</hi> who greatly pitied his Master, that he should serve so rigorous a Mistress: but the Esquire had one Scruple in his Mind, <hi>Who this</hi> Dulcinea del Toboso <hi>should be?</hi> But while <hi>Don Quixot</hi> was tormenting himself, at <hi>the poor Rock;</hi> he unluckily happened to drop some words, by which it evidently appeared, that <hi>Dulcinea del Toboso</hi> was only <hi>an imaginary</hi> Lady or Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess: and that indeed she was no other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, but a certain coarse Country Wench, Daughter of the Farmer <hi>Alonso Zanchez,</hi> and for her Plainness called <hi>Joan.</hi> Ta, Ta, cries <hi>Sancho Pancha,</hi> and is the Princess <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> our Neighbour <hi>Joan Zanchez!</hi> By my troth, a sturdy Quean; well may my Master <hi>languish</hi> for her, for I am well perswaded, she hath no regard or sense of Love-matters: but 'tis a good-natur'd Wench, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Methinks, Sir, there can be nothing more pat, or proper for this place, than this Story. For just such a <hi>Disappointment</hi> do we all meet with, in the Explication for which Dr. <hi>Sâ€”th</hi> hath made us wait so long; as <hi>Sancho Pancha</hi> had when he found the Princess <hi>Dulcinea,</hi> was <hi>Joan Zanchez.</hi> Dr. <hi>Sâ€”th</hi> had raised the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of his Readers, in no fewer than <hi>seven</hi> Preliminary Chapters; in the eighth he promises in the Title of it, the long-lock'd for, the much-desired, Catholick, and Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Explication of <hi>a Trinity of Divine Persons, in the Unity of the Godhead:</hi> but when all comes to all, he tells us, the three Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons are nothing else but <hi>the Substance of God,</hi> or the Godhead, <hi>diversified into three Postures.</hi> Never were Men so bilk'd before as his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders are, at this News; 'tis the Princess <hi>Dulcinea</hi> turned into <hi>Joan Zanchez!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Was it worth while, to fall upon Dr. <hi>Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock</hi> in that outragious manner, only because he would not call the three Divine Persons, <hi>three Postures of the Godhead,</hi> or <hi>the Substance of God in three Postures?</hi> Dr. <hi>Sherlock,</hi> poor, sensless, illiterate, <hi>Cantabrigian Ignoramus,</hi> thought, that these words <hi>Father, Son</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> implied something that was <hi>real.</hi> He imagin'd, that the Notion which all Men <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally</hi> have of a Father, his Son, and a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit distinct from both, must be filled up with something that will <hi>honestly</hi> and <hi>satisfactorily</hi> answer to such Names and natural Notions of a Father, a Son, and a Spirit diverse from both: therefore, saith he, seeing these Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons are <hi>Spiritual,</hi> and <hi>Immaterial,</hi> and <hi>Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent;</hi> I call them three <hi>Minds,</hi> three <hi>Spirits,</hi> and three <hi>Beings.</hi> But <hi>the Adepti</hi> of <hi>Oxford</hi> will make him know his Mistake; <hi>First,</hi> Dr. <hi>Wallis</hi> tells him, <hi>Three Persons and one God,</hi> is as much as to say, three <hi>Respects of one God to his Creatures;</hi> he is their <hi>Creator, Redeemer</hi> and <hi>Sanctifier,</hi> and in this sense is called <hi>three
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:63367:12"/>
Persons,</hi> tho he is indeed but <hi>one God,</hi> and but <hi>one Being:</hi> but Dr. <hi>Sâ€”th</hi> answers, 'tis neither so nor so; <hi>three Divine Persons are the Substance of God, in three Gambals, or Postures;</hi> or in three such <hi>I know not whats,</hi> which have the same or like Reference to Things Spiritual and Immaterial, that <hi>Postures</hi> have to <hi>Bodies.</hi> The three <hi>Personalities</hi> are <hi>that</hi> in the one Substance of God, which Mutability, Presence, Absence, Inherence, Adherence, and such like <hi>(changeable)</hi> Affections and Habitudes, are in the Substances to which they belong. He thinks, it should seem, that the Faithful must <hi>put their Trust</hi> in three <hi>Postures;</hi> and <hi>worship</hi> Mutability, Presence, Absence, or something which in Spirituals is <hi>like to them;</hi> something which is no more in the Deity, than Postures are in Bodies. I fancy Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> will object to him, that it is of the Nature of a meer Habitude or Modality, to be <hi>changeable:</hi> and that the Personalities in the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (or God) are <hi>not alterable</hi> or changeable. He will say too, it may be, that there is no meer Modality but may be away from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or Substance to which it belongs; <hi>without any damage to the Essential Perfections,</hi> of such Nature or Substance: but you cannot take away the Personalities, or the Persons, from the Substance of God, without lessening the Perfections of the Godhead. Therefore we must not say, that the three Divine Persons, are only the Divine Substance with three <hi>Modes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The three Divine Persons, he saith, are the one Substance of God diversified in three <hi>Postures.</hi> But how shall we conceive, that the Substance of <hi>God</hi> in the first Posture, or in Posture <hi>A, begat</hi> the same Substance of God (in Number) in Posture <hi>B?</hi> and how doth the third Posture, or Posture <hi>C, proceed</hi> (for under Pain of Damnation we must not say of this <hi>third</hi> Posture, how was it <hi>begotten)</hi> from the Substance of God considered in the Postures <hi>A</hi> and <hi>B?</hi> The Divine Substance, say they in Posture <hi>A,</hi> or in the first <hi>Mode, generated</hi> the Divine Substance in the second Mode, or, as Dr. <hi>Sâ€”th</hi> speaks, in Posture <hi>B;</hi> and the self-same Divine Substance in the first and second <hi>Modes, breathed</hi> (you must well mark <hi>that)</hi> the self-same Divine Substance in the third Mode, which is Posture <hi>C.</hi> Now how shall we understand such <hi>Gibberish</hi> as this? may they not as well tell us <hi>in plain terms,</hi> that to be <hi>Trinitarians,</hi> 'tis necessary that we should renounce at once all good Sense, and content our selves for ever with a <hi>Cant</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Sense?</p>
               <p>The <hi>Persons,</hi> as distinguished from the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of God, are only <hi>Personalities;</hi> which is to say, three such <hi>Modes,</hi> as Posture, Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability and Dependence; saith Dr. <hi>Sâ€”th.</hi> They that hear this, will presently say Dr. <hi>Sâ€”th</hi> and the Socinians are very near to an Agreement; we are like to have this <hi>tedious, intricate</hi> and <hi>dangerous</hi> Controversy fairly ended, by the rare and particular Dexterity of Dr. <hi>Sâ€”th.</hi> For he hath taught us, that all the Difference is indeed <hi>nothing:</hi> both Parties confess one self-same Substance, Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sense or Godhead, only the <hi>Orthodox</hi> contend for <hi>three Postures</hi> in this Substance; and the <hi>sullen, conceited</hi> Socinians hitherto seem un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to allow of more than one <hi>Mode</hi> or Posture; but under the Institution and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of such a Teacher as Dr. <hi>Sâ€”th,</hi> they will return to the <hi>full</hi> Acknowledgment of the <hi>whole Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> had said, that there are some who make the three Divine <hi>Persons,</hi> to be nothing else but three <hi>Modes;</hi> and he maketh thereupon this Note, <hi>Can any one think that the Father begat only a Mode, and called it<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> his Son?</hi> Let us see now, how Dr. <hi>Sâ€”th rates</hi> him for this piece of Ignorance. <q>No, good Sir, no; none that I know of, is in danger of think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or saying so: no more than that <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> begat only the <hi>Shape</hi> and <hi>Figure</hi> of a Man, and then called it his Son; or (to turn your own <hi>blunt</hi> Weapon against your self) no more than God the Father begot another <hi>Self-consciousness,</hi> and called it his Son.</q> 
                  <hi>Animadv.</hi> p. 291. And at <hi>p.</hi> 241, 242. and often else-where, he saith, <hi>the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonalities,</hi> by which the Deity stands <hi>diversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi> into three distinct <hi>Persons,</hi> are by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of Divines, both <hi>Antient</hi> and <hi>Modern,</hi>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:63367:12"/>
called and accounted <hi>Modes.</hi> So that in short, let all the <hi>Dunces</hi> take notice for the time to come, that Dr. <hi>Sâ€”th,</hi> with all the <hi>Antients</hi> and <hi>Moderns</hi> at his Heels, saith, pronounceth and declares, in manner and form following; <hi>the Personalities</hi> in the Godhead (not <hi>the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons)</hi> are three Modes, Affections, or Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, of the Divine Substance, Nature, or Essence.</p>
               <p>Now were I Dr. <hi>Sherlock,</hi> I would not grant to this <hi>arrogant</hi> Adversary, the least Tittle of all he contends for. It is certain, there is nothing more common with the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphysicians, who follow the Schools; than to call the three <hi>Persons,</hi> three <hi>Modes;</hi> and sometimes more largely, <hi>three Modes of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence of the Divine Substance,</hi> or the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of God. Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> may well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it, that neither hath he mistaken <hi>the Modalists,</hi> nor have they mistaken in what they <hi>mean</hi> to say. He may say, it is indeed true, that in all other Persons, <hi>Human</hi> Persons and <hi>Angelical</hi> Persons, we may be so <hi>nice,</hi> as to distinguish between the <hi>Persons</hi> and the <hi>Personalities:</hi> for Example, the <hi>Personalities</hi> of <hi>Peter, James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> are only <hi>Modes</hi> or Properties peculiar to these three Persons, by which they are <hi>ultimately</hi> distinguish'd from one another, and from all other Persons of the same <hi>Specifick</hi> Nature, namely the Human; but the <hi>Persons</hi> of <hi>Peter, James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides those <hi>Modes</hi> and Properties, take in also <hi>three distinct</hi> intelligent <hi>Substances,</hi> in which those Modes suosist. It is true, I say, that Human (and also <hi>Angelical)</hi> Persons may be <hi>thus</hi> distinguished from their <hi>Personalities;</hi> but 'tis otherways in the three Divine Persons: the three Divine <hi>Persons</hi> are properly and truly called <hi>only three Modes;</hi> the reason is, It is supposed by the Modalists, that in the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head the three Persons have all <hi>the self-same</hi> individual Substance or Essence <hi>in Number;</hi> and that they have also but one <hi>self-same</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, Will and <hi>Energy</hi> (or Power of Action) <hi>in Number;</hi> contrary to what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens in all other Persons, whether <hi>Human</hi> or <hi>Angelical,</hi> who all have <hi>distinct</hi> Substances, <hi>distinct</hi> Understandings, Wills and Energies, as well as are <hi>distinct</hi> Persons: this being so, 'tis evident, that the very <hi>Modes</hi> or <hi>Personali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> in the Godhead, cannot be distinguished from the <hi>Persons;</hi> we must say, that the three Divine <hi>Persons</hi> are three <hi>Modes, because they are distinguished from one another by nothing else,</hi> as all <hi>other</hi> Persons are. All other Persons are distinguished by their <hi>distinct</hi> Substances their <hi>distinct</hi> and several Understandings, Wills and Energies; as well as by their peculiar <hi>Modes</hi> and Properties: but in the Godhead there is no such Distinction; it has one <hi>self-same</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, Understanding, Will and Energy; 'tis only <hi>distinguished</hi> by its <hi>Modes,</hi> and those <hi>Modes</hi> are distinguished from one another <hi>by themselves only.</hi> Briefly, Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> may say, that all the Modalists acknowledg no other Distinction between the three Divine <hi>Persons,</hi> than is between <hi>Modes;</hi> they are not distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished by their <hi>Substances,</hi> nor by particular <hi>Understandings, Wills,</hi> or <hi>Energies of their own:</hi> therefore we, properly enough, call them three <hi>Modes.</hi> Dr. <hi>Sâ€”th</hi> may <hi>wrangle</hi> as long as he pleases; he may (if it be for his Credit) write such another Book of <hi>Inadversions,</hi> as this upon Dr. <hi>Sherlock;</hi> but when he has done and said all he can say or do, all Men but himself will perceive that these two Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions are the same <hi>for sense:</hi> this of Dr. <hi>Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock,</hi> which he imputes to the Modalists, and which Dr. <hi>Sâ€”th</hi> so much abhors, <hi>the three Divine Persons are only three Modes, of Subsistence, in the Substance or Essence of God;</hi> and this, which Dr. <hi>Sâ€”th</hi> owns, and maketh to be the Substance of his whole Book, <hi>the three Divine Persons are the Substance or Essence of God, diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sified by three Modes of Subsistence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But above all; I would not have Dr. <hi>Sâ€”th</hi> please himself overmuch in this; that he hath cited some Passages of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe the <hi>Personalities</hi> of the Father, Son and Spirit, by <hi>Modes. Justin</hi> and <hi>Irenaeus</hi> have called them <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Modes of subsisting;</hi> others call them <hi>Properties:</hi> but by Modes, Properties, Characters, and such like, the Fathers meant quite another thing, than Dr. <hi>Sâ€”th</hi> and the Moderns do; they meant what Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> and Dr. <hi>Cudworth</hi> mean.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:63367:13"/>
By a <hi>Mode</hi> and <hi>Property</hi> they meant that <hi>discriminating</hi> Character, by which the Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals of any <hi>Specifick</hi> Nature are distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or differenced, from all the Individuals of the same Species or Nature. For Example, the Individuals of the <hi>Specifick</hi> Nature of <hi>Humanity,</hi> are particular <hi>Men;</hi> and all these Individuals or particular <hi>Men</hi> are discrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, characterized, differenced or <hi>modified,</hi> each by his<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> particular <hi>Properties: Peter</hi> from <hi>John, Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> from <hi>James,</hi> by parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Properties, Characters or Modes, both of Body and Mind; one (for instance) is <hi>bigger<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> taller, wiser,</hi> or some other the like, than the other. This was what they meant, when they described <hi>Personalities</hi> by <hi>Modes,</hi> and when they said there were three Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Modes, or Characters in God: they meant not in the least to deny, that each Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is <hi>a particular</hi> Substance, Essence or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, different in Number from all other Substances, Essences or Natures; or to deny, that each Person is a particular <hi>Being:</hi> they meant only, that each Individual, or each Person, besides the common <hi>Specifick</hi> Nature, (that is, besides the meer <hi>Human, Angelical</hi> or <hi>Divine</hi> Nature) has also some particular Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties or Characters; which <hi>ultimately</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish him, from all the Individuals or Persons of the same Species, Specifick Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or Kind.</p>
               <p>It is not true therefore, what Dr. <hi>Sâ€”th</hi> pretends, that by <hi>Modes</hi> of Subsistence the Antients meant no more, than certain such Habitudes or Affections, as Mutability, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, Absence, Posture, or such like: they meant <hi>real, discretive</hi> and <hi>characterizing</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties or Qualifications; and by <hi>Person</hi> they meant, a particular, individual, intelligent Substance or Essence, and so modefied or characterized. They were far from <hi>dreaming,</hi> that the three Divine Persons, an Almighty Son, an Almighty Father; and an Almighty Spirit distinct in Number from both, were only one individual Substance distinguished, or diversified by only three such <hi>lank</hi> and <hi>meagre</hi> Affections, as <hi>Absence, Posture, Adherence;</hi> or any other that are no more in a <hi>Spiritual</hi> Substance, than those three are in <hi>Bodies;</hi> to which they add <hi>no Perfection,</hi> and from which they are (every Moment) <hi>separable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Socinians are not concerned, <hi>what</hi> becomes of the Dispute about <hi>Persons</hi> and <hi>Personalities</hi> in God; <hi>whether they are ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quately the same, yea or no;</hi> and again, <hi>whether the Moderns who follow the Schools, agree with the Antients in their Notion of them:</hi> for I will put to Dr. <hi>Sâ€”th</hi> a <hi>plain</hi> Question, to which if he is disposed to give a <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>Categorical</hi> Answer, it will appear to all Men, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he falls in with Dr. <hi>Sherlock,</hi> or with the Unitarians; that is to say, he is either a <hi>Tritheist,</hi> or (what, I doubt, he will as much abhor) a <hi>Socinian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He saith, there is <hi>one</hi> only Divine <hi>Substance,</hi> Essence or Nature; and thus far we agree with him: but he adds, this one Substance is so diversified by three <hi>Modes,</hi> Affections or Habitudes, or something like to them, that we must say (under pain of Heresy and Damnation) that this one Substance is three Divine Persons, a <hi>Father,</hi> his <hi>Son,</hi> and a <hi>Spirit</hi> distinct from both. Therefore I ask, have the three (pretended) Divine Persons, each his own <hi>proper, peculiar</hi> and personal Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, Will and Energy; so that there are in the Divine Substance, or in God, <hi>three</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct (All-knowing, Almighty) <hi>Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Wills</hi> and <hi>Energies,</hi> as there are three distinct <hi>Persons;</hi> as Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> has affirmed? Or have the three Persons but one only <hi>self-same</hi> Understanding, Will and Energy in Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, as there is but one <hi>self-same</hi> Substance in Number? If he saith the former, he joins Hands with Dr. <hi>Sherlock;</hi> and is guilty of <hi>Tritheism,</hi> no less than he: for three (Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scient and Omnipotent) Understandings, Wills and Energies, without doubt, are three Gods. If there be three <hi>Omnisciencies</hi> and <hi>Omnipotencies,</hi> of necessity there must be three <hi>Omniscients</hi> and <hi>Omnipotents:</hi> but <hi>that</hi> is Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theism, even in the Judgment of <hi>Athanasius</hi> himself; who expresly denies <hi>three Almighties,</hi> or three All-knowings. And indeed I do not think, Dr. <hi>Sâ€”th</hi> will say, that each Person hath his own proper and personal Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:63367:13"/>
Will or Energy; so that there are three distinct Understandings, Wills and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nergies in what his Party call the <hi>Godhead:</hi> I see his Book is written with more Judgment and Precaution, than Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi>'s; or even than any that I have seen, that have been written in Defence of the Trinitarian Cause. But if he denies, that there are three (All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowing, Almighty) Understandings, Wills and Energies; he is a Socinian, he has granted to us the Point in Controversy, he grants the whole that we contend for. They will allow him to say, there are <hi>three</hi> Persons, or <hi>three thousand</hi> Persons in the Godhead; so long as he grants <hi>but one</hi> (Omnipotent) Energy and Will, and <hi>but one</hi> (All-knowing) Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Wisdom. If this be granted to us, 'tis plain to every one who gives but never so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle heed; that the Question about <hi>three Persons,</hi> is a meer Strife of <hi>Words;</hi> and the Authors of the <hi>Brief History,</hi> and <hi>Brief Notes,</hi> are (tho not in their Words, yet in their Senses) as Orthodox as Dr. <hi>Sâ€”th</hi> and the Schools. I will affirm, we have no need of our <hi>Brief Histories,</hi> or <hi>Brief Notes;</hi> we need not make an operose Proof of our Doctrine of the Unity of God, from the Holy Scriptures or from Reason: the whole Controversy with the Church is ended, in the Resolution of this short and plain Question; Is there more than one <hi>All-knowing, Almighty</hi> Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Will and Energy? If you say, there is but one such <hi>Understanding, Will</hi> and <hi>Ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,</hi> in one self-same Divine <hi>Substance;</hi> you may talk of as many Persons, Fathers, Sons, Spirits, Modes, Properties, Respects, <hi>Nothings,</hi> as you please: we will only peaceably advise you, that these are meer <hi>empty</hi> Words, that have nothing to answer them in the thing under Consideration. When you have granted to us, that there is but one Divine <hi>Substance,</hi> and but one Omniscient, Omnipotent <hi>Understanding</hi> and <hi>Energy;</hi> what you add more of Persons, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, <hi>Thingams,</hi> and call them a Trinity, 'tis an Addition only of <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Names;</hi> not of Realities, or <hi>Persons</hi> that are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly so called.</p>
               <p>These things being <hi>so,</hi> and so very <hi>evident<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
                  </hi> I cannot wonder, that so discerning a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher as Dr. <hi>Cudworth,</hi> never speaks of the Trinity of the <hi>Schools</hi> (maintained by Dr. <hi>Sâ€”th)</hi> without calling it a <hi>Nominal</hi> Trinity, a Trinity of <hi>Names and Words</hi> only, <hi>a disguised Sabellianism:</hi> which is to say, Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarianism or Socinianism drest up in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd <hi>Cant</hi> of the <hi>Schools.</hi> But whereas the <hi>Schools</hi> deform the sincere and easy Notion of the Unity of God, as 'tis held by the Socinians and Sabellians, by transforming it into a <hi>Fantastick</hi> Trinity of <hi>Nominal</hi> Persons, or of Persons who are Persons only <hi>in Name,</hi> not in Truth and Reality: therefore Dr. <hi>Cud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi> saith farther, that this Trinity is <hi>Jar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonry in Philosophy, a Trinity that falls not under Human Conception, and which cannot be in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> Intellect. System, <hi>p.</hi> 605. Elsewhere he scruples not to name it, <hi>the Philosophy of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These are the just Characters which that great Philosopher and Divine gives of <hi>the Scholastick</hi> Trinity of Dr. <hi>Sâ€”th:</hi> he giveth his Reasons up and down in the <hi>Intellectual System;</hi> but 'tis not necessary for me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port them, when every one may see them in the Author himself; and besides they are too <hi>Philosophical,</hi> to be put into a Discourse which I design for the Use of the less learned, as well as of the learned.</p>
               <p>I have done with Dr. <hi>Sâ€”th's Explication,</hi> for this time: If he is angry with me for the Reflections I have made thereupon, I protest 'tis without just Cause. I have used no disrespectful Language; I <hi>have</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, and <hi>do</hi> acknowledg the <hi>Worth</hi> of the Man, and all other Perfections in his Book, but only this one, that <hi>it</hi> maintains an <hi>unjusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable Explication.</hi> The Method or Structure of his Book is Natural, Elegant and Judicious; the Words, Expression, or Phrase, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, forcible, clean, and well chose: it hath very many agreeable Turns of <hi>Wit,</hi> which render it pleasant to an ingenious Reader. As this Author hath a great deal of <hi>Wit,</hi> so he hath known how to govern it in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect; that <hi>he is witty, without Buffoonry.</hi> This
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:63367:14"/>
is a Conduct, not very usual in those that have much Wit; commonly they know not how to manage it; and among other <hi>unjudicious</hi> Neglects, they forget the <hi>Where</hi> and <hi>When,</hi> and other such like Circumstances; they are so taken with their Talent, as to be always using it, because they know not that <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting fooling is true and meer fooling.</hi> But I wish that Dr. <hi>Sâ€”th</hi> in exercising his Wit, had remembred the <hi>who,</hi> which he hath ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly forgotten: and <hi>that</hi> was utterly an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight, and a very great one. He cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse himself, by pleading the many Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions in Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi>'s Book: a candid Man would not impute them to the Author, but to the extream Obscurity of the Subject; when the Subject it self is contradictory, there will be many Contradictions committed in defending it. I doubt not that Dr. <hi>Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock</hi> will find many Contradictions in Dr. <hi>S-th</hi>'s second Chapter.</p>
               <p>Having done to Dr. <hi>Sâ€”th</hi> this Right, he ought not to be out of Humour, that I as a Socinian, have attacked his Explication; as I have some other Learned Men: I mean no Disrespect thereby to him, or them; I acknowledg their <hi>Personal</hi> Merit, but cannot give up to them so sacred a Truth, as the Unity of God, or consent that it be <hi>disguised</hi> and <hi>deformed.</hi>

                  <hi>Of the Explication by Mr.</hi> Hooker, <hi>Author of the Ecclesiastical Polity.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>MR. <hi>Hooker,</hi> tho he was none of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church, is not of less Authority in the <hi>particular</hi> Church of <hi>England,</hi> than any one of the Fathers is: and it must be confest he was not only a very good, but a very learned and discerning Man. But it is observed of him, that in speaking of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, he speaks somewhat incorrectly: this was a Doctrine which he took for granted, there was no Dispute in his time about it; so he hath delivered himself, not with his usual Precaution and Judgment. He saith, <q>That <hi>the Substance</hi> of God, with this Property, <hi>to be of none,</hi> doth make the Person of the the Father. The very <hi>self-same</hi> Substance in Number, with this Property, <hi>to be of the Father,</hi> maketh the Person of the Son. The same Substance, having added to it the Property of <hi>proceeding from the other two,</hi> maketh the Person of the Holy Ghost. So that in every <hi>Person</hi> there is implied both <hi>the Substance</hi> of God, which is one; and also that <hi>Property,</hi> which causeth the same Person really and truly to differ from the other two.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I must observe, in the first place, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, that Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> in this matter hath not spoken over critically and correctly; nay, hardly <hi>Orthodoxly:</hi> I mean, as Orthodoxy goes among the Learned of his own Parry. He saith that <hi>the Substance</hi> of God, with these Properties, <hi>to be of none,</hi> to be <hi>of the Father,</hi> and to <hi>proceed from the other two,</hi> make <hi>the Persons</hi> of the Father, Son and Spirit: now to be <hi>of none,</hi> to be <hi>of the Father,</hi> and to <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from both,</hi> are but other Words for this Sense, <hi>to beget, to be begotten,</hi> and <hi>to proceed.</hi> But that Father of <hi>Modern</hi> Orthodoxy, <hi>Peter Lombard,</hi> whom we have already twice men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, denies that these (before-mentioned) are Properties in <hi>the Substance</hi> of God, or that they <hi>can</hi> belong to it: he saith, <hi>Essentia Divina non est genera<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>, nec procedens;</hi> i. e. <hi>the Substance of God neither begets, nor is begotten, nor proceeds.</hi> 'Tis impossible to make <hi>this</hi> consist with Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> who expresly ascribeth those Properties to the Divine Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance or Essence, and saith, that being in the Divine Substance, they make it to be three Persons.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:63367:14"/>
What shall we do here? Shall we say, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend <hi>Hooker</hi> has mistaken, and missed his Sons (who are all the Church of <hi>England)</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an Error concerning the Trinity? Hath he ascribed to the Divine Essence, <hi>Properties,</hi> which he calleth <hi>Persons,</hi> that are not in it? To give up <hi>Hooker,</hi> is to dishonour the Church of <hi>England</hi> it self; to part with Father <hi>Hooker,</hi> is to endanger the very <hi>Surplice,</hi> and even <hi>the Cross</hi> in Baptism; nay, <hi>that Book of Books</hi> the Common-Prayer. If Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> could err about the Trinity; What will the <hi>Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi> and <hi>Trimmers</hi> say? Will they not be apt to pretend too, he may have erred in his profound Dissertations and Discourses for the <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Discipline</hi> of the <hi>Church?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I am afraid, for all that, we must keep close to <hi>Peter Lombard,</hi> Master of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, and of the <hi>Modern</hi> Divinity: he hath been espoused by all the Popes since <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third, by the <hi>Lateran</hi> Council which was <hi>General,</hi> and by the tacit Approbation of the whole Church ever since.</p>
               <p>I doubt, it is not much more passible, that Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> saith, that the Properties, <hi>to be of none,</hi> to be <hi>of the Father,</hi> and to <hi>proceed,</hi> do (together with the Substance of God) <hi>make the Persons</hi> of the Father, Son and Spirit. It is not true, that those are the Properties which <hi>make the Persons:</hi> he might say, that they make the Persons <hi>to be Father, Son and Spirit,</hi> or to have that threefold <hi>Relation</hi> among themselves; but they do not make the three Persons to be Persons; or thus, they do not make (as he speaks) <hi>the Persons. To be of none</hi> maketh <hi>the Father;</hi> but I deny, that it <hi>maketh</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> affirms) <hi>the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> of the Father: the Character, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty which maketh <hi>the Person</hi> of the Father, is quite another from the Property or Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter that maketh <hi>the Father.</hi> To <hi>beget,</hi> to be <hi>begotten,</hi> and to <hi>proceed,</hi> are Properties which constitute <hi>the Relations</hi> of Father, Son and Spirit: but they are other Properties, which make <hi>the Persons</hi> of the Father, Son and Spirit.</p>
               <p>Concerning the Properties or Characters which make <hi>the Re<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>tions,</hi> all <hi>Learned</hi> Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians are agreed; they acknowledg them to be these <hi>three, Active Generation,</hi> (not, as Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> mistakes, this meer Negation <hi>to be of none)</hi> Eternal <hi>Passive</hi> Generation, or <hi>to be begotten,</hi> and <hi>Eternal Procession:</hi> but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Properties that make <hi>the Persons,</hi> they are not so well accorded. The Antient Divines said, the Property that maketh <hi>the Person</hi> of the Father, or the peculiar Property and Character of <hi>the first</hi> Person, is <hi>Monarchy;</hi> the Property of <hi>the second</hi> Person, is <hi>Wisdom;</hi> and of <hi>the third</hi> is <hi>Love.</hi> Others said, that the Property of the first Person, is <hi>Beatitude</hi> and <hi>Rest;</hi> the Property of the second is <hi>Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration:</hi> others had still other Conceits, all of them false.</p>
               <p>But allowing now the way of speaking, used by Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> what a <hi>Riddle</hi> has he propounded? Here is the <hi>self-same</hi> Substance (in Number) <hi>unbegotten,</hi> and yet <hi>begotten:</hi> the Divine Substance with the Property <hi>to be of none,</hi> or to be <hi>unbegotten,</hi> is (saith he) the Person of the Father; the self same Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance (in Number) with the Property <hi>to be of the Father,</hi> or to be <hi>begotten,</hi> is (or makes) the Person of the Son. Can the self-same Substance (in Number) be <hi>of none,</hi> and yet be <hi>of the Father;</hi> be unbegotten, and begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten too? Are they not <hi>contradictory</hi> Terms, and therefore not to be applied to the self-same Substance in Number?</p>
               <p>They will say, Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> doth not affirm, that the self-same Substance is begotten and unbegotten; this indeed were a <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">

               <p>But do they reckon they have to deal only with Fools? What if I should say, my Hand <hi>as in my Pocket,</hi> is unskalded; but <hi>at in my Glove,</hi> 'tis skalded: would it not be a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, for all the Blinds of <hi>in the Pocket,</hi> and <hi>in the Glove?</hi> The <hi>self-same</hi> Hand in Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, cannot be <hi>burnt,</hi> and <hi>unburnt;</hi> the <hi>Place</hi> in which it is, will not palliate such a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction: in like manner, the self-same Substance cannot be <hi>begotten,</hi> and <hi>unbegotten;</hi> because you are pleased to pretend, you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:63367:15"/>
it sometimes in one Subject or Person, sometimes in another. In whatever Person a Substance is, it must either be a begotten Substance, or an unbegotten; it cannot possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be <hi>both:</hi> if it really remains unbegotten, then it never was begotten; but if in process of time it has been begotten, then it cannot still be unbegotten.</p>
               <p>Why do our Opposers choose to maintain such extravagant <hi>Paradoxes,</hi> rather than ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg so easy and natural a Truth, as the Unity of God? Rather than receive the first Commandment, in its natural and obvious sense; rather than we will sincerely (and without Disguise or Juggle) own that there is but one only God: we will choose to make our selves scorned by all sensible Men; by saying, the self-same Substance (in Number) is begotten, and <hi>unbegotten;</hi> 'tis of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nay 'tis of Father and of Son, and yet <hi>'tis of none.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us consider Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi>'s <hi>Catch,</hi> in three <hi>Human</hi> Persons. He will say, the Substance of <hi>John</hi> is begotten, <hi>as</hi> John <hi>is the Son of</hi> Peter; but <hi>John</hi>'s Substance is unbegotten, <hi>as</hi> John <hi>is the Father of</hi> James: and yet it is the <hi>self-same</hi> Substance in Number, that is thus both begotten and unbegotten.</p>
               <p>Is it so? but if <hi>John</hi>'s Substance be really begotten, I will ever stand in it, that his Substance is not unbegotten: it was begotten by his Father <hi>Peter,</hi> therefore 'tis a begotten Substance, not an unbegotten.</p>
               <p>Some one may say, but is not <hi>John</hi>'s Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance unbegotten, <hi>in respect of</hi> John'<hi>s Son</hi> James; tho it was begotten by <hi>Peter?</hi> By no means: for if <hi>Peter</hi> begot <hi>John</hi>'s Substance, then <hi>John</hi>'s Substance is begotten, tho his Son <hi>James</hi> begot it not; and consequently it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be said to be an unbegotten Substance, in any respect whatsoever.</p>
               <p>In short, they would have us to say; <hi>John</hi>'s Substance is unbegotten, because it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten by <hi>Peter,</hi> and not by <hi>John</hi>'s Son <hi>James.</hi> I deny, that 'tis a proper, or a true way of speaking: for if the Substance has been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten by any whomsoever; it must never after be called unbegotten, on this absurd account, that it was not begotten by <hi>James,</hi> but by <hi>Peter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Farther, whereas Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> saith, the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of God, with this Property <hi>to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten,</hi> or to be <hi>of the Father,</hi> maketh the Person of the Son: I ask, is then the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of God begotten; I pray, who begat it? They must answer, the Father! But did the Father beget the Substance of God? Do they not say, that the <hi>self-same</hi> Substance that is in the Father, is also in the Son? But if so, then if the Father begat the Substance of the Son, or of God, he begat his <hi>own</hi> Substance. Can any one beget his own Substance? Is it not a Contradiction, a manifold Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Is it not as much as to say, <hi>he was before he was?</hi> He that begets his own Substance, begets himself: but he that begets himself, is thereby supposed to have <hi>been</hi> before he <hi>was.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I know, it hath been said by some Divines, God is <hi>self-originated</hi> or <hi>self-begotten.</hi> But 'tis utterly false; they ought to have said, he is <hi>unoriginated</hi> or <hi>unbegotten.</hi> As God is not ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginated or begotten, <hi>by another;</hi> so much less <hi>by himself:</hi> not by another, for then that other must be before him, at least in order of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; not by himself, because then he must <hi>be</hi> before he <hi>was.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to finish with Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> I will show his Followers, that in pursuance of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, they will be forced to say; that as the Father <hi>begat</hi> the Son, so the Son <hi>destroys</hi> the Father. And I make challenge to them all, to rescue their Master's Explication from that fatal Consequence. <hi>Begotten</hi> doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways destroy <hi>unbegotten;</hi> when once a Person or Thing is <hi>begotten,</hi> that <hi>self-same</hi> Thing or Person can be no longer <hi>unbegotten.</hi> If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>the Substance</hi> of God <hi>unbegotten,</hi> maketh (as Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> contends) the Person of the Father; and the <hi>self-same</hi> Substance <hi>begotten,</hi> maketh the Person of the Son: it una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably follows, that <hi>the Generation</hi> of the Son is <hi>the Destruction</hi> of the Father; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Property or Characteristick of the Father, even <hi>unbegotten,</hi> is destroyed out of the Divine Substance, by the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteristick of the Son, which is <hi>begotten.</hi>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:63367:15"/>
Unbegotten (that is to say, <hi>the Father)</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains no longer in the Divine Substance; if begotten (that is, according to <hi>Hooker, the Son)</hi> hath taken place in it.</p>
               <p>O that our learned Opposers would vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe, to consider these things impartially: that they would not reckon 'tis their Glory, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend received Doctrines, only because they have been <hi>long</hi> received, and by <hi>many;</hi> as if <hi>Prescription</hi> or <hi>Numbers</hi> could alter the Nature of Truths and Untruths. Which (I pray) is more honourable, to own a clear and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Truth; or to set one's self to darken and to obstruct it? I confess the latter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires more Wit, especially against an able and dexterous Defendant; but 'tis the other that deserves greater Praise, especially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, because it argues <hi>Sincerity</hi> and <hi>Justice.</hi> But I pass to the last sort of Trinity, the <hi>Mystical</hi> Trinity.</p>

               <p>THE poor common People are first made to believe, by the help of <hi>corrupted</hi> Copies, and <hi>false</hi> Translations of the Bible, that 'tis a Scripture-Doctrine; that there is a <hi>Trinity</hi> of Divine Persons, an Almighty <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> an Almighty <hi>Son,</hi> and an Almighty <hi>Spirit</hi> distinct and different (in Number) from both Father and Son. But because <hi>this</hi> (at the very first sight) appears contrary to Reason and common Sense; therefore in the <hi>next</hi> place they are told, that they must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider this Doctrine, as a <hi>Mystery,</hi> impossible indeed for us to <hi>understand,</hi> yet necessary to be <hi>believed,</hi> because God hath said it. How many things, say these Teachers, are there in the Works of Nature, which we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand not, no more than we can understand the Trinity: and yet we believe them to <hi>be,</hi> as assuredly; as if there were no Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in conceiving how they should <hi>be.</hi> As, that there are <hi>Antipodes,</hi> whose Feet are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite to our Feet, and who walk with their Heads <hi>downwards,</hi> with respect to our Parts of the World. Again, that a <hi>Spirit</hi> can move a <hi>Body</hi> from place to place: tho <hi>Reason first</hi> assures us, that there can be no Motion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a <hi>Resistance;</hi> and <hi>then,</hi> that a pure Spirit can meet no Resistance, from <hi>Matter</hi> or Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. Also, that the Parts of Matter or Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies hold together; tho no Cause can be assigned for it, but what appears immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be unsufficient, nay ridiculous. All these are great Truths, and we believe them, even <hi>contrary</hi> to the Verdict of Reason: how much more ought we to believe the Trinity, which hath been propounded to us, as an Article of Faith, in the Word of God it self, tho our fallible and frail Reason reclaims, and kicks perhaps against it? When the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians, say these Gentlemen, have accounted for all the <hi>Mysteries</hi> of Nature and Art; let them begin to object to the Trinity, that 'tis a <hi>Mystery,</hi> and that it hath sundry <hi>Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to Reason:</hi> but till they do the first, 'tis nothing else but a bold Impiety to insist on the other.</p>
               <p>It must be confessed, Sir, that this is the most plausible Pretence; the strongest Hold, as well as the last Resort of our Opposers: when we have drove them from all other Posts, here they take Sanctuary.

For there is a vast Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween my not being able to conceive <hi>how a thing should be,</hi> and a clear Apprehension and Sight that <hi>it cannot be.</hi> There are (it may be) Mysteries, which we cannot compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend how they should be: but that three <hi>Divine</hi> Persons, or three distinct <hi>Almighty</hi> and <hi>All-knowing</hi> Persons, should be but <hi>one</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, but <hi>one</hi> All-knowing, or but <hi>one</hi> God, a Man (who considers but with never so little Intention and Sincerity) clearly sees, that <hi>it cannot be.</hi> In short, that 'tis not a <hi>Mystery,</hi> but (as Dr. <hi>Sâ€”th</hi> speaks) an <hi>Absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity</hi> and a <hi>Contradiction.</hi> In a word, we do not reject the Doctrines of the <hi>Trinity</hi> and <hi>Incarnation,</hi> because they are <hi>Mysteries;</hi> but because they are <hi>plain Contradictions</hi> to Reason and common Sense, and consequently <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths:</hi> for (without doubt) Reason and Truth are but two Names, for the same thing; and <hi>clear Reason is no other thing, but clear Truth.</hi>

Our Opposers will not vouchsafe, so much as to hear Catholicks and Lutherans, when they plead <hi>Mystery,</hi> for the Transubstantiation or the Consubstantiation: I desire of them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to give me but one Reason, why that Plea is not as good in those Controversies, as in these of the Trinity and Incarnation.</p>
               <p>The Author of two <hi>Dialogues,</hi> concerning the Trinity and the Transubstantiation, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself pressed with this Difficulty, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers to this effect, that <hi>there are a great many more Texts of Holy Scripture for the Trinity, than are pretended for the Transubstantiation.</hi> But this is no Solution of the proposed Difficulty: for 'tis not at all the Question, which Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine hath most Texts alledged for it; but only, whether the Pretence of <hi>Mystery,</hi> be not a Plea as rational and allowable, against all the Exceptions made against the Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation, as an <hi>impossible, inconceivable</hi> and <hi>contradictory</hi> Doctrine; as 'tis to the <hi>same</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, when urged by the Socinians against the Incarnation or Trinity? But whereas that Author insists upon an Answer, wholly foreign to this Difficulty; and is so careful to bring together, from Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> all the Texts alledged for the Trinity: he is desired to name to us so much as one Text for either of those Doctrines; that is not given up to the Socinians, by some of the most Learned Interpreters and Criticks of his own Party, as indeed no Proof of the Trinity, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, or the Divinity of the Son or Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. What avails it, for a Man to talk of the great number of Texts, which he can alledg; when the <hi>ablest</hi> Persons of his own Party, do (in the mean time) ow<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

that the Socinians have this great Advantage on their side; whenever he shall do it <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly,</hi> I will bear the Reproach, if I do not justify what I have said, by Citation of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Authors of the first Note and Rank among our Opposers.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Our Opposers urge, that there are (and the Soci<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="4 letters">
                     <desc>â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢</desc>

Well, suppose the Socinians should grant these, or other unaccountable Mysteries, which not only are not comprehended, but are <hi>contradicted by Reason:</hi> What then? Why, then they are very inconsiderate, to deny (as they do) the Trinity and Incarnation; on this account, that 'tis contrary to Reason, or implies Contradictions and Absurdities. But our Opposers should have thought better of this Objection, before they laid so great a Weight on it; even the Weight of their whole Cause. For tho we should grant, that we believe some Mysteries of Nature or Art, against which Reason objects, and many ways <hi>contradicts them;</hi> yet is this no Plea for the Trinity, or the Incarnation. For if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Natural or Artificial <hi>Mysteries,</hi> 'tis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we plainly see that so the thing is: we <hi>see</hi> or we <hi>feel,</hi> or have some other <hi>undeniable</hi> Proof of the thing; some such Proof, as no rational Man <hi>will</hi> or <hi>can</hi> resist. Doth any Man believe <hi>Misteries,</hi> or wonderful Tales, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his Reason, and the Reason of all other Men; without a most <hi>manifest</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contestable</hi> Proof of them; without some such Proof or Proofs, as <hi>undeniably</hi> evince the thing so to be? But will our Opposers pretend, they have any such Proofs for the Incarnation or Trinity; such <hi>manifest,</hi> such <hi>evident,</hi> such <hi>uncontestable</hi> Proofs, that no sober Man, or no reasonable Man can except against them, or refuse to admit of them? I do not think they will pretend to it, if it be but for this only Reason, because the Socinians are confest to be a Rational and Learned Party. Are those Evidence or Proofs <hi>uncontestable,</hi> which are rejected, not without some Scorn, by some of the learnedest, and most unsuspected of their own Party? Are they <hi>uncontestable,</hi> that not only may be <hi>interpreted</hi> to another Sense, but also are either otherways <hi>read</hi> in the best Copies of the Hebrew and Greek, or may be otherways <hi>translated</hi> from those Languages; and all this, by confession of the more ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of our Opposers themselves? Briefly, we say, <hi>Mysteries</hi> there are; and it may be such Mysteries, as are even <hi>contradicted by Reason;</hi> that is, are <hi>in some respects</hi> Contradictions to our present (short-sighted and frail) Reason: but when we believe there are some such Mysteries, it is because they appear to our <hi>Senses;</hi> or are proved to us by some such either <hi>Reason</hi> or <hi>Authority,</hi> as no reasonable Man, much less any Number of such Men, does or can deny to be <hi>uncontestable.</hi> And otherways, all the <hi>unwarrantable</hi> Nonsense in the World may be imposed on us, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Pretence and Cloak of Mystery. But now the Doctrine of the Trinity, hath not only no <hi>uncontestable</hi> Proofs; but the Pretences for it are so feeble, that none of them can be named, but is not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, but <hi>despised</hi> by some of the learnedest of our Opposers themselves. They would perswade us to acknowledg a <hi>Mistery,</hi> full of Contradictions to the clearest <hi>Reason,</hi> and to indisputable <hi>Texts</hi> of Holy Scripture; and supported in the mean time, only by some Texts that may be <hi>interpreted</hi> to a <hi>Rational</hi> Sense, that is, to a Sense that hath nothing contrary either to <hi>Reason,</hi> or to the <hi>unquestiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> Parts or Texts of the Holy Scripture. For Peace sake, we would do so, if it were some light matter that they urged on us: but when the Question is, about one or more Gods, one or more <hi>Divine</hi> Persons, we judg it adviseable, not to be too facile in admitting such dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Mysteries; Mysteries that would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the Allegiance and Homage that we all owe to the one true God.</p>
               <p>I have done, Sir, with the <hi>Explications</hi> of our Opposers. You see what they are:
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:63367:17"/>
Dr. <hi>Sâ€”th</hi>'s Explication is only <hi>an absurd So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinianism;</hi> or Unitarianism disguised in a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphysical and Logical <hi>Cant.</hi> Dr. <hi>Wallis</hi> his Explication is <hi>an ingenious Sabellianism;</hi> and in very deed differs from Unitarianism, no more than Dr. <hi>Sâ€”th</hi>'s, that is to say, only in the wording. Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi>'s is such <hi>a flat Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theism,</hi> that all the Learned of his own Party <hi>confess</hi> it to be so; and Dr. <hi>Sâ€”th</hi> hath written a very accurate Book to <hi>prove</hi> it so. Dr. <hi>Cud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi>'s is <hi>a moderate Arianism;</hi> the <hi>Ariani molles</hi> ascribed as much to the Son, as this Doctor doth: and he denies as much to the Son, as they did; even an <hi>Equality</hi> of Power, and Authority with the Father. Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi>'s is <hi>a Trinity, not of Persons, but of Contradictions:</hi> and he hath advanced such a Son, as of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity <hi>destroys</hi> his Father. What the <hi>Mystical</hi> Divines teach, cannot be called an <hi>Explication;</hi> they deny all <hi>Explications:</hi> we must say there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>'tis Samaritanism;</hi> for <hi>what</hi> our Saviour says of the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> by way of Reproof and Blame, <hi>that</hi> these Gentlemen profess concerning themselves, that <hi>they worship they know not what.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These, Sir, are the Doctrines that we op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; I shall leave it with you, whether it be without cause.</p>
               <p>Before I conclude, I beg your Leave to say two words to Mr. <hi>Basset,</hi> who hath an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd (or thinks he has answered) to the <hi>Brief History of the Unitarians:</hi> and to Dr. <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> and Dr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> Men of Dignity in the Church; but who have not thought it below them, to use the very vilest Language, and the basest and most ungrounded Scandals, that their Malice to our Persons, and their Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of the Points in question between us and the Church, could suggest to them.</p>
               <p>These two Doctors tell their Readers, that the Unitarians deny the <hi>Omniscience</hi> of God, or that he fore-knoweth <hi>contingent</hi> Events: that they deny his <hi>Omnipresence,</hi> making him to be present in all Places, only by his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, and his Power; that they ascribe the same degree of Power and Knowledg, and pay the self-same Worship to the Lord Christ, whom they affirm to be a meer Man, which they ascribe or pay to Almighty God; and hereby, say these Doctors, they are guilty of an <hi>Idolatry</hi> that is equally <hi>evident</hi> and <hi>abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.</hi> They pretend to prove this Charge out of the Writings of <hi>Socinus, Smalcius,</hi> and some others of the Party. I say now;</p>
               <p n="1">1. That their Quotations out of <hi>Socinus</hi> and the rest, are (for a great pa<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                  </gap> of them) as false and disingenious as those <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                  </gap> Dr. <hi>Wallis</hi> were: as any one will see, who shall take the Pains to consult the Authors themselves.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They make it to be a great Heresy in some Socinians, that they deny there is a <hi>certain</hi> Fore-knowledg of <hi>contingent</hi> Events: they say 'tis a Denial of God's <hi>Omniscience.</hi> And yet all Men know, that very many of the most Learned <hi>Trinitarians,</hi> have been of the same Opinion; Antients as well as Moderns, Protestants as well as Catholicks. Nor have these Doctors so much as offered at an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to the Reasons of <hi>Socinus</hi> and <hi>Crellius,</hi> concerning a <hi>conditional</hi> Knowledg in God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That God is <hi>Omnipresent,</hi> not in his Essence or Person, but by his Knowledg and Power; is also held by divers Learned <hi>Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians:</hi> and it must needs have been the Opinion of those <hi>Fathers,</hi> who either were <hi>Anthropomorphites;</hi> or held that God is a <hi>Body,</hi> not a <hi>Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. These Doctors have written against the Socinians, by occasion of the <hi>English</hi> Books, that have been lately published, by those of that Perswasion: they should therefore have attacked the Doctrine of those Books; they should have described our Opinions out of our own Writings, not from the Books of <hi>Foreigners.</hi> The <hi>English</hi> Socinians sincerely believe, that God is truly <hi>Omniscient;</hi> that he foreseeth all Events, how <hi>contingent</hi> soever they may be to us. They believe the real <hi>Omnipresence</hi> of God; or that he is present in his <hi>Essence</hi> or <hi>Person</hi> in all Places, and not only by his Power, Knowledg or Ministers. They honour, or if we must use that word, they <hi>worship</hi> the Lord Christ; neither with the same <hi>sort,</hi> nor with the same <hi>degree</hi> of Worship, which is due to God: they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship or <hi>honour</hi> him, with their Minds, only as
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:63367:17"/>
one <hi>who is highly exalted by God, above all Principality and Power, and every Name that is named;</hi> and to whom God hath given to be <hi>Head over all things to the Church.</hi> In a word, they neither pay a higher <hi>Worship,</hi> nor im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute a greater <hi>Power</hi> or <hi>Knowledg</hi> to the Lord Christ, than the most <hi>Learned,</hi> and the far <hi>greater Number</hi> of Trinitarians, impute and pay to the Human Nature (the <hi>meer</hi> Human Nature) of Jesus Christ, in his present State of <hi>Exaltation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have said these things so often in our late Books; we have defended them so ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly, that none but Persons of <hi>little</hi> Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty, or <hi>great</hi> Inconsideration, would object to us such Opinions as these before-mentioned. But these Gentlemen had a longing Mind to be Authors; and who should they signalize themselves upon, so popularly, as upon the Socinians: if they have got Reputation by their Books, that is, by <hi>weak</hi> Arguments and <hi>strong</hi> Calumnies; it is with so very few, that I do not think they will reap an <hi>Advantage</hi> by it.</p>
               <p>But one of them urgeth, that <hi>Socinus</hi> was in this dangerous Heresy, that the Soul of Man, after the Death of his Body, is in a State of <hi>Inactivity</hi> and <hi>Unperception;</hi> in a word, neither <hi>perceives</hi> nor <hi>lives,</hi> till the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of the Body: at which time, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth Immortality, by the meer Grace or Gift of God; but is not, of its own Nature, immortal.</p>
               <p>I do acknowledg, that this seems to be the Opinion of <hi>F. Socinus;</hi> but, I believe, of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few Unitarians besides. But this <hi>Error</hi> was common to him, with some of the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:</hi> the Learned Monsieur <hi>Du Pin</hi> has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that <hi>Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, Minutius Foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix</hi> and <hi>Arnobius</hi> were in this Sentiment. There was no Reason therefore to object this, to <hi>Socinus;</hi> as if it were a <hi>peculiar</hi> Opinion of his; much less to the <hi>English</hi> Unitarians, who never defended it; nor, that I know of, do any of them hold it.</p>
               <p>As to Mr. <hi>Basset,</hi> there are two things very remarkable, in his Answer to the <hi>Brief History</hi> of the Unitarians: the meanness and dulness of the Book it self, it being written with no Vivacity, Wit, or Elevation of Thought; and the undecent Insolence of the Author. His Book being such as it is, if the <hi>Brief History</hi> cannot shift for it self, against that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to it; the Historian is resolved it shall take its Fortune: he is perswaded, that when a discerning Man has read Mr. <hi>Basset</hi>'s Answer; if he again looks over the <hi>Brief History,</hi> he will (at least) as much approve of it, as at first. Mr. <hi>Basset</hi> has said nothing, that can in the least shake the Reputation of the <hi>Brief History;</hi> unless his Reader will believe him, when he charges the Historian with false Quotations of Authors. To this the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian answers; that he hath not made one false or mistaken Citation: but Mr. <hi>Basset</hi> sometimes not understanding the Authors that are quoted, for they are Greek and Latin; and sometimes mistaking the Sense of the Historian, which he doth very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently; it hath happened hereupon, that he hath charged the Historian with his own either <hi>Ignorances</hi> or <hi>Inadvertences.</hi> But I am not at leisure to write a Vindication, every time that negligent and ignorant Scriblers mistake my meaning; or the Sense or the Authors by me alledged.</p>
               <p>I reckon it to be his <hi>Insolence,</hi> that a Person who had nothing to offer on these Questions; but what was very trivial and vulgar; should yet give disrespectful Language, without any the least Provocation given by the Historian. He saith, for instance, that indeed the <hi>Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign</hi> Socinians have been learned and subtile Men; but he cannot say so concerning the <hi>English:</hi> but for <hi>the Epistler,</hi> so he calls the Writer of the <hi>Brief History,</hi> because 'tis writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in four <hi>Letters;</hi> he saith, Poor Wretch ought to have imploy'd his <hi>small</hi> Talent to honester Purposes, and not have sought for Reputation only by his <hi>Nonsense,</hi> his <hi>Follies,</hi> and his <hi>Impieties.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was a <hi>Mortification</hi> indeed, c<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ming (as it does) from so great and worthy a Hand: but the Comfort is, we are apt to be more advised, and better'd also by our <hi>Humiliations.</hi> And yet I am still of Opinion,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:63367:18"/>
that as Mr. <hi>Basset</hi> thought it requisite to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer the <hi>Brief History</hi> after the great Victory gained over it by Dr. <hi>Sherlock:</hi> so there will not want many others, who will judg it no less than necessary; to give other Answers to it, after this Triumph of Mr. <hi>Basset.</hi> But however that be, I answer to Mr. <hi>Basset,</hi> as <hi>Moses</hi> did to <hi>Pharaoh, Glory over me;</hi> I am resolved Mr. <hi>Basset</hi> shall have the <hi>Self-satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,</hi> that he hath mauled <hi>the Epistler</hi> for ever.

               </opener>
               <p>I Heartily thank you for the perusal of this most learned and judicious Letter, which I return you; and I congratulate the worthy Author, whom the Divine Wisdom has made an Instrument for the vindicating of his glorious and incommunicable Attribute of <hi>Unity,</hi> which he has in several Tracts even demonstrated, not only by clear and express Scriptures and obvious Reason, but also now at length from the Confessions of the Trinita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians themselves, the Infringers of it. For whilst each one condemns the several Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of the rest, as either inconsistent with the Unity, or the Trinity, they do all in their turns bear Witness to the Unitarians, that their Opposition to the Trinitarian Doctrine is well-grounded and reasonable, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently their Doctrine of the Unity the Truth of God. For if each one of their Explications does either introduce the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of three Gods, or the Heresy of Sabel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianism, as they call it, the turning the Son and Holy Ghost into Names and Operations without any real Distinction of Persons, or Things answering those distinct Names, as it plainly appears they do; then it undeniably follows, there is no such Trinity as they imagine, but a Numerical Unity of Person and Essence in God, as the Unitarians hold; and as some Trinitarians contend in their Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position one to another. It remains then that the Trinitarian Worshippers, especially the common People, do seriously and in the Fear of the one most High God, consider, what Notions, Conceptions, or Idea's they have, of an Infinite and Almighty Holy Ghost distinct from the Almighty Father and Producer of them: For they cannot possibly escape the Condemnation of one of the highest Crimes, even the Worship of three Infinite Real Gods, or two Imaginary Ones, or two Names without Notions; that is, <hi>they know not what,</hi> as this Author expresses it; Condemnation I say, not only by the Unitarians (who wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship the Father only as God in the highest and strictest Sense of that Term) but also by all the Trinitarians, that hold not the same Opinion, or have not the same No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>I know the Times of Ignorance God wink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth at, as well now, as before the preaching of the Gospel; but after he has made his Unity manifest, and vindicated it from the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:63367:18"/>
Scholastick Subtilties and absurd Distinctions, that have been invented to hide the Truth, he then commands all Men, to whom this Evidence comes, to repent. Inconsidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Negligence will not now excuse. Men must not say or think (as they common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do) this Point is too high for me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine; for they have already determined it, whilst they profess to believe in, and to worship three equal ones, a Father, a Son, and a Spirit. Neither can they alledg the Universality of the Trinitarian Faith: For besides (as this Author observes) the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping of many Gods was formerly, and is now far more universal; we see that this Opinion and Worship, which soever it be, is condemned by at least four to one of those that go under that common Name of Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians. The rise of these divers and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Explications has been this (as is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served by the Author in that which now obtains) that Learned Men looking narrowly into former Explications, have found them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent with the Oneness of God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have devised somewhat either more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure, that would hide the Contradiction, or somewhat more consistent with the Unity, tho it destroyed the Trinity; or more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with the Trinity, tho it destroys the Unity, as Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> has done. And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps others like him may devise other Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheses, taking it for granted from the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices of early Education and customa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thinking, that the Trinity is a Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal of Christianity. But we see here they labour in vain to reconcile manifest Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions: and in believing the Son and Holy Spirit to be equally God with the Father, they offend against express Scriptures and clear Reason, upon the account of their own Reasonings upon obscure Texts; and therein transgress the plain Principles, both of Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Light and Revelation, which require, 1. That nothing be held for Truth contrary to evident and Fundamental Truth. And, 2. That obscure Passages are to be interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by clear Passages, and the Current of Scripture, and not otherwise. The Jews walking contrary to these Principles, was the cause of rejecting Christ and Christianity, and it is indeed the ground of all Error what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. In vain do Men press a great many Texts (that have, even in the Opinion of Learned Trinitarians, another meaning) to prove that the Son and Holy Ghost are God; till they can reconcile that Inference to plain Scripture and evident Reason. In vain does the Author of <hi>The Snare broken</hi> (who could not overcome the Prejudices of his Education and Converse) perswade Men <hi>to lay aside their Philosophy,</hi> and <hi>wholly to betake themselves to a Scriptural Consideration of the</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>; by which I understand, they must take the words of Scripture without understanding them, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling them to other Scriptures, or even the Current of Scripture or common Reason. Do they think that Scripture is to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted contrary to it self? Or, that Divine Wisdom has made the Belief of Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions necessary to Salvation?</p>
               <p>It seems strange that Christians should be very zealous in the Punctilio's of the Worship of God, Ceremonies of Posture, Gesture or Apparel; Forms of Addresses to God, the wording of Faith to an Iota; and yet go on in the Worship of one God the Father, and of two distinct from him, God as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly as he; and in which their Worship terminates equally with him. They can love God the Father with all their Hearts and Strengths, and two Persons distinct from him with the same All: they can give all to one, and all to another, and all to a third, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver question the Possibility of it; as if there were a Trinity in Unity in every Man; that his own Heart were three Hearts, to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed all and entirely upon each of three Objects, and yet be but one Heart still. But whither am I carried? This Author needs none of my Notes or Illustrations: and indeed both he and all others that have labour'd in this Controversy, may surcease their Pains henceforth, and leave what they have already said to the Judgment and Conscience of all considerate and sincere Men. I am,</p>
