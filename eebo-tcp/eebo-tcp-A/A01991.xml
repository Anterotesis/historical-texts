            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Haue noted for some yeares many thousands of Histories collected out of sundrie Authors, to whose consciences I referre you, ingaging my selfe for nothing of their writings, but a faithful collection which I haue made, &amp; yet thinking that they would offer nothing that were false or foolish to bee published, without good consideration. I call them <hi>Admirable,</hi> for that the reasons of many of them are farre beyond my apprehension, and that to my iudgement they are miraculous. They are also <hi>Memorable,</hi> for the contentment, instruction and consolation which good and quiet soules may gather thereby. I haue very seldome exceeded the age that went last before vs, and will forbeare it more in those bookes that shall followe, If GOD will giue mee leaue. The History of our times is an abridgement of all the wonders of fore-passed ages: Do not blame me if I were desirous to offer vnto you some patternes, to reuiue your thoughts. When you shall haue seene the continuance, if you shall remember any thing worthy to bee left to our posteritie, you may surmount our example. It shalbe easie for you. I do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uite and coniure you. GOD cannot bee better knowne and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced of vs in his iudgements and mercies. Those which can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it in a heigher stile, will not disdaine my weake affection. As for others which cannot or will not do any thing but censure and
<pb facs="tcp:3511:4"/>
inueighe, I wish them true vnderstanding and a good conscience. In my opinion GOD in this newe age doth raise vp men, who in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers places are carefull to note in Iournals and Annales, all that we see worthie to bee reserued for instruction of our successors. I would not set out in collours these plaine Histories, which I repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent vnto you. As good stomaks haue no neede of saulces, so strong spirits are content with a simple reading, the which they studie to conuert into quickning substance. The ende of this collection and of the following, shalbe Feare GOD, and keepe his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements: this is the dutie of man. For GOD will call euery worke into iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, bee it good or euill.</p>

            <p>IF any thinke these Histories strange, he may see the very title sayes as much: And it is good for an author to bee as good as his title: And this being a translation, it must be strange.

                  </gap>urae Caracterismis,</hi> settes downe an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable History at large; the which I will relate as briefly as I may. A yong Maiden remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning (saith he) neere vnto mee, whose Father was a Cooper: beeing fifteene yeares old, of a good consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Body, fayre and of a good spirit, of a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly complexion mixt with sanguin: her Name was KATHERINE GAVLTHIER, fell sicke and weake, through diuers accidents. About the month of Ianuary in the yeare 1571. her monethly termes aduanced twise or thrise: but being staid, presently through the vyolence of her infirmity, they caused a great wearinesse ouer all her body. It was suspected she had beene poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned by a certaine Woman of an ill fame, who had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen her a peece of a Cake. Eating it, shee felt it painfull to swallow. After the which, she began to feele strange paines at her stomacke; shee grew leane, vomited some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, her stomacke fayled her, and she felt a dysinesse in her Head, with other accidents which torment Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:3511:7"/>
with Child, especially in the 4. and 7. month, For about mid Iune she was subiect to Feauers &amp; some kind of Convulsions. Her paines did in like sort increase; so as like a mad Woman shee tormented her selfe, growing bigge, pale &amp; short-winded, and in the end, she was so opprest with paine, as she grewe blacke in the Face, like one that had beene strangled. She was so tormented as foure men could scarse hold her, for casting her selfe from her bed to the ground, there was no kind of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulsion, but did afflict her. These panges hauing conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued by fits vnto the 9. month, her Parents, began to flie vnto the Phisitians. I was first called, because I dwelt neerest. But being from home, they repayred to Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster BEAVSARD, who considering of this disease thought she had beene troubled with VVormes. It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened after many grieuous pangues, that Nature wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king by her force, made her to voyde a quicke Eele at her seege, the which was presently brought vnto mee. It was a very Eele, great as a mans thombe, and a foote and a halfe long, with a good proportion, and all parts perfect. Three dayes before it came forth, both the Mayde and those that were about her, heard a great noyse, and as it were a hissing in her belly. And beeing come forth, the Maide sayd: That she had felt the Eele put forth her head before, and drawe it backe againe, and then to thrust forth sodainly and with violence. This Eele remayning among the excrements, seemed for a great space dead, but beeing put into a pot of water, it did stirre very strongly. After the voyding thereof, the extreme pangues which had so much tormented her, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ceasse. But the Eele which they had ript and clensed, being hanged vp whereas neither Cat not any
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:3511:7"/>
other beast could reach it, vanished in an instant. Soone after the Maide began to cast vp great abundance of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the which I came to see beeing like vnto vrine, and of a strange taste, as the Patient sayde<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This vomiting continued 15. dayes, in euery one of the which, she voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded about 24. pounds waight of water at the mouth. I report not these things by heare-say, but for that I did see and toucht them with my hands. I was no lesse amazed to see, that besides this great abundance of water which she voyded at her mouth, she made water in great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, twise or thrise a daie, without any swelling of her bellie, or any other part of her bodie: neither did shee drinke aboue one cup of VVine, Beere or other liquor in a daie. I asked her, if she felt no payne in one of the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seraicall veines?</hi> She answered me, that her left side had alwayes troubled her much, since the voyding of the Eele, and that before, she had felt some heauinesse in that place: but since she was troubled with great gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and pricking, which made her to crie out, when I did but touch it with my finger. After shee had vomited so much water, she began to cast forth lumps of haire at her mouth, some as long as a mans finger, some more, some lesse, such as wee see fall from olde Dogges, in great quantitie for certaine daies, enough to haue stust whole dozens of Tennice Balles. She cast them vp with great heauing at the heart and much paine, falling one night into wonderful transies. Hauing found her in a manner, like vnto one that was readie to giue vp the Ghost, and carefully obseruing all things, beeing layd vpon her belly, I did see her cast her selfe so so dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layd from one side vnto the other, as if she had not beene presently stai'd, she had beat her head against the wall,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:3511:8"/>
oragainst the bed post. She held her hands so strongly together, as it was impossible to open them. Sometimes she beat her breast so violently, as she was like to kill her selfe. This fit continued from seuen of the clock at night vntill nine, and then shee knew not any one. Oftentimes (as in the suffocation of the Matrix) she grewe wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully red, and seemed very weary and toyled, with some beginning of a Feauer. Once or twise she fomed about the mouth. And an other time, beeing in the extremity of her fit, shee fell sodainly into a great laughter, and then presently wept bitterly. Being come vnto her selfe, and falling presently into a long extasie, she began in an instant to speake, as if she had addressed her selfe vnto GOD, holding her hands vp to Heaueh, shee spake these words in effect. <q>O great GOD; seeing thy beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is so great, and incredible, how long shal we remaine here? when wilt thou take mee out of this World, that I may inioye thee?</q> hauing said thus, as it were awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and looking on them that were about her, she said: <q>Which of you hath done mee this wrong to call mee backe into this valley of misery, and into the prison of darkenesse, when as I did rest so sweetly, and did sport my selfe in the goodliest Gardens that could be immagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned?</q> I do not thinke that a simple and ignorant Maide, (as this was) could vtter such words but in extasie. In the meane time she cast vp great lumpes of hayre mixt with much white matter, and very thicke: and somtimes like vnto the dung of Pigions or Geese. In this abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of filth appeared little peeces of wood and shreds of Parchment. A little after she had an other vomiting of a matter as black as coles; you would haue said pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly it had beene Inke, or rather coles beaten to pouder
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:3511:8"/>
and mixt with water, the which continued a good while, two or three pounds euery day, sometimes with such store of white haire, long &amp; hard, as it would haue made a good Ball. After two dayes, she did vomit about two pounds of pure bloud, as if a veyne had bene opened. This monstrous casting continued a whole weeke, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming still at a certaine houre: and then the fits of the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilepsie</hi> wherewith she was dayly tormented ceased, the which notwithstanding continued sometime, once in three dayes, and in the end euery seuenth day. In the meane time she did still cast haire, but not so aboundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie as before: but blacker and shorter, as if they had beene cut small, and with it a slimie humour, like vnto thick matter.</p>
            <p>About the middest of September, she did vomit great peeces of parchment, halfe a spanne long, like vnto the thicke and fleshie skinne of a mans body. Afterwards she cast vp others, that were thinner, but all black. In the end shee did vomit some that were very thinne, but strong, amongst the which there were three a foote long made in fashion of lozenges, with strange markes and figures. After these skinnes, followed an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of stones, which shee did cast vp at a certaine houre euery night, with great noise and sounding, such as is heard in walles that are pulled downe: some were thick, others pointed, vnequall in forme, and of a darke coul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour: they were all small, and yet such as they did still feare the maide would haue beene strangled: some were couered with Chalke, and cymented together, in such sort, as they might be sayd to haue beene pulled out of a wall. Once in my presence she did vomit a pointed stone, as big as two Chest-nuts. This stone remained aboue a
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:3511:9"/>
quarrer of an houre in her throate, during the which she had no pulce nor respiration, so as laying a light feather vpon her mouth, it did not moue: her hands and feete grew colde, and her body stiffe, as if it had beene an Image. Thinking that she had finished her course, and that paine had ended all her miseries. I went out of the chamber, saying that she was dead: when as the Mother called me sodenly back againe, saying, that her daughter did stirre, and opened her eyes. As soone as I was retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, she did cast vp this stone with great violence: I did see it come forth, and heard the noise thereof falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a bason, the which did amaze both my selfe, and all that were in the Chamber. At the same instant she did spit out a peece of wood as bigge as ones thombe, but with lesse difficultie then the stone: and withall some black haires, but few. There followed after an other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident almost incredible, where-with the maide had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most beene choakt, for shee did vomit vp a bone of a Triangle forme, sollide without, and hollow and spun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious within. The next day shee cast vp little boanes of diuers formes and proportions. Amongst all these were seene stones and haire, and then peeces of Glasse and Copper. CORNELIVS GEMMA sets downe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies which he did apply, and maintaines, that part of her infirmitie grew by naturall causes, and part by the Impostures and illusions of the Diuill, who was a chiefe Agent in these accidents which wee haue reported.

TABOVE pleaded then with great shewe, than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king GOD, after the manner of MOYSES, IOSVA, and others, for the victory which hee did see comming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, euen as (sayd hee) the ancient Fathers had done, for the victories which GOD had sent them: hee beganne and concluded his oration with a verse of DA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VID. <hi>Hic est dies quem fecit dominus. &amp;c.</hi> But herein the poore man did singe like vnto the swanne. The said
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:3511:10"/>
GRAFFINS yeelded to this sentence, and sought no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse. The second sentence was the 28. of Iuly in the said yeare 1552. against the President PELISSON: by the which it was sayd, that the decrees contained there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and impugned by TABOVE made by the said Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, were false and falsly framed: declaring the said Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident, for euer incapable to hold any royall Office, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning him to aske mercie of GOD, the King and of Iustice, and to paie a thousand pounds fine to the King and two hundred to TABOVE, his goods to bee forfited, and to passe the remaynder of his life where it should please the King. The solemnity of the pronouncing and execution thereof was: that the sayd President, hauing one halfe of his bodie be-nummed with the palsey, olde and broken with age, diseases and cares, was brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the open Court, the doores beeing open, and the Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges sitting in the Castell of <hi>Dijon,</hi> where he was prisoner, by two Archers in a chaier, attired in blake taffata pinckt, with a roabe of blacke satten, a little night-cappe of silke, and his square cappe in his hand. At this spectacle and in his presence, TABOVE made a speech. The sentence was afterwards pronounced, &amp; the poore old man was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained with much a doe, and through the helpe of his gards (that had brought him) to kneele downe, holding in his hands a burning torch of wax weighing 4. pounds and asked pardon of GOD: the King: of Iustice; and of TABOVE. The saied decrees and other peeces that were impugned were torne in his presence, which done he intreated the Court that hee might bee freed out of the Castell for the weakenesse and great infirmity of his person. Answere was made him, that the Court would consider of it. The third sentence was the fourth
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:3511:11"/>
of August, against the aboue named BOISSONNE a Preest and Councellor, by the which hee was found guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of fals-hood and other crimes mentioned in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse, and the decrees, declarations, and other pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The fourth sentence was the same daie against ROZET an other Councellor, all one with the former.</p>
            <p>After all this, the sayd President, BOISSONNE and ROZET Councellors, hauing a firme confidence in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues that they had not offended, notwithstanding these punishments, they go vnto the King and shewe him, that if the crimes, whereof they are condemned bee proued true, it were a monstrous thing to see them liue in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weale. But if through the slander of their accuser, they haue beene reduced vnto that extremity; there is no reason, (for the dignity where-with his Maiesty had honored them in the Soueraignty of <hi>Sauoie,</hi>) that the cause should be referred to one Parliament aloane, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of a small number, to degrade and depriue them in that sort, of their good names, fortunes, and honours, leauing them nothing but their soules, which is onely a remainder of greefe and perpetuall sorrowe.

               </gap> that the former decres of the 28. of Iuly and the fourth of August, were voide and that the cryminall processe,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:3511:11"/>
by the which they had beene giuen, should be viewed and Iudged a newe, without any respect to bee taken of the said decrees, &amp; TABOVE condemned in costs, domage and interests. The Court at <hi>Dijon,</hi> aduertised of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, at the instance of TABOVE, beeing much troubled in the beginning, come vnto the King, debate the reasons, and maintaine their decrees, she wing that it would cause impunity of crimes of importance, and blemish the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue of his Parliaments. They had good audience, with the sayd TABOVE, who pretended new matter, and concealed nothing which hee thought might auaile him: alledging that this accusation framed by him, was alwaies with the quality of the Kings Atturney general, being so receiued and neuer reproued, and therefore hee ought not to bee condemned in costs, domages and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests, like vnto a priuate party, although the accusation were not so well grounded as this was. Some of the Court Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> which had assisted at the resolution of the said decree of nullity, were sent for; they come, and are heard with them of <hi>Dijon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All being duly examined, it was decreed by the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy Councell the 7. day of March. 1555. that the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence giuen the 16. of May, vpon the said Nullities, should take effect, and touching the principall cause, the parties should be sent to the Court of <hi>Paris,</hi> to bee iudged in the presence of a President, and two Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors of the Court, named in the decree, and three other Councellors hauing assisted at the iudgement of the said Nullities; three Councellors of the Parlament of <hi>Dijon,</hi> named by the said decree, aud three others of the sayde Court of <hi>Dijon</hi> which had assisted at the iudgement gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen against the parties accused, and by sixe Masters of

Requests. The Processe beeing in question, TABOVE, (fearing that which after happened to fortifie his accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, or rather to hinder the decision) frames newe crimes, whereof no mention had beene made in the former Processe: whervnto the parties accused oppose. Wherevpon the King by his Letters Pattents of the 15. of September the same yeare, made a declaration, that sending them to the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was not that the Court should take knowledge of any other cause or crimes, then those for the which the parties had been condemned in the Court of Parlament at <hi>Dijon,</hi> and whereof they had complayned vnto the King: the Kings Atturney generall excepted, who vpon view of the sayd Processe, finding the accused to bee guilty of other crimes, might make pursute against them at his pleasure. Moreouer they were charged by the said Letters to do right vpon the repetition of money, adiud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to the said TABOVE, for the pursute of the Processe. The said letters were allowed and regestred the 18. of September. The Parties accused are againe examined and heard by the Court, vpon the crimes wherewith they were charged. TABOVE is allowed to make newe productions, and the accused to contradict them. In the ende this cause being examined in so goodly an Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, a definite sentence was giuen in these termes that follow.</p>
            <p>The Court doing right to all, and without respect to the quality of the Atturney general in the court of <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery,</hi> taken by the said TABOVE in the sayd Processe: but so farre as it doth touch the corruptions and falseties pretended by TABOVE against the sayd PELISSON BOISSONNE and ROZET, had absolued and did ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:3511:12"/>
the sayd PELISSON, BOISSONNE and ROZET respectiuely, of the sayd pretended false-hoods, and did condemne the sayd TABOVE, for that respect, in the charges of the same sute and in domages and interest of the sayd PELISSON, BOISSONNE and ROZET: which domages and Interests, the Court for some causes them mouing, hauing taxed and moderated, that is to say to the sayd PELISSON two hundred pounds; to BOISSONNE foure score pounds; and to ROZET the like some of 80. pounds: and that, besids all other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences, domages and Interestes, which were adiudged vnto them by a sentence of the 16. of May 1555. for the paiement of which domages and interestes the said TA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BOVE should remaine in prison. And as for all other accusations and crimes obiected by the sayd TABOVE against PELISSON, BOISSONNET and ROZET, (the knowledge whereof was referred to the sayd Court) both they &amp; the parties were discharged by the Court, and freed from farther sute, without any charges, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, or interest of eyther party: reseruing notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing power for the Kings Attorney generall, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed against the sayde decrees of the 11. of May 1539. the 9. of March, the 20. of September, made in fauour of the sayd Earles of <hi>La Chambery,</hi> and Bishop of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienne,</hi> by way of Nullitie, and for them to make their defences to the contrary.</p>

Court, on a day of pleading, the doores being open, bare-headed, and bare-foote, on his knees, in his shert, and a halter about his neck, holding in his hands a burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Torche of two pound waight: and then to say and declare openly with a lowd and intelligeble voyce, that falsely, maliciously, slanderously, wrongfully, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the truth, hee had charged and accused the saide PELISSON, BOISSONNE and ROZET of the sayde pretended falseties, crimes and offences, for the which he was sorry, and desired pardon &amp; mercy of GOD, the King, the Iustice, and of the said PELISSON, BOISSONNE and ROZET.</p>
            <p>And moreouer the Court did ordaine, that the petitions and complaints exhibited vnto the King by the sayd TABOVE, together with the suggestions of falshood made by him against the said parties, should be defaced and rent in his presence. And this done, to bee led in the same sort by the Vshers of the Court, and set vpon the marble Stone, being at the end of the Great Stayres of the Pallace, there to do the like penance, and so to be carted from the same place vnto the Pillorie at the <hi>Halles</hi> in the Cittie of <hi>Paris,</hi> and there being set by the Hang-man to bee turned thrice about, and then to be carryed backe to the <hi>Concergery</hi> or prison of the Pallace. And moreouer the Court did condemne the said TABOVE to do penance in the open Court of the said Parlament of <hi>Chambery,</hi> whether he should be safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conducted, and to pay two hundred pounds for a fine vnto the King, and to continue in prison at <hi>Chambe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> vntill the full payment of the fines, charges, domage and interest adiudged, as well to the King; as to the said parties: after which payment made, to bee perpetually

confined to the said Country of <hi>Sauoy,</hi> or to any other place within this Realme that should please the King. And moreouer the Court did declare his other goods confiscate to whom they did belong, the said fines, char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, domage and interests being first payed and dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. And for certaine causes and considerations then mouing the said Court, did ordaine, that the saide PE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LISSON should be sent backe, to receiue those admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that were appointed to bee giuen him, inioyning him to keepe and cause to bee kept the Kings royall or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynances in the said Court of <hi>Chambery,</hi> and not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringe them vpon paine of an arbitrary punishment. Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in the Parlament at <hi>Paris,</hi> the eleuenth of October. 1556.</p>
            <p>No Reader of iudgement, ought to taxe the Iudges, who haue censur'd this cause with so great contrarietie, as the like hath not beene heard. The Court of <hi>Dijon</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured themselues in their conceits to doe well without fraud or malice. Those of <hi>Paris</hi> according to their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, shewed their authority, which is supreme; des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couering (it may be) some thing that was newe, and not before knowne. It is not for mee, beeing a simple Collector, and who feares to speake of such assemblies, to giue any reasons of the said contrarieties. It sufficeth to set downe the fact, and to compare the greatnesse of the Parlament of <hi>Paris</hi> with the rest, yet I may not conceale, what I heard a Councellour of one of the aboue named Parliaments say, that (in the question of Iustice of such contrary decrees, vpon a crime pleaded before the King, who desired to vnderstand the truth) those of <hi>Dijon</hi> had iudged according to their conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and those of <hi>Paris</hi> iustly and according vnto Lawe.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:3511:14"/>
Before I leaue this matter which is so exemplary and of such consequence, in regard of many the like accidents which do dayly happen, I will aduise the Reader to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue the ende of this accusation, where the Hunts-man is taken in his owne snare.</p>
            <p>This poore ACTEON, relying vpon his quality, and gouerned by his passions, came to this ende, hauing drawne many great personages into danger: for seeking reuenge onely, hee ruined himselfe. The which may serue for any one that shall attempt to accuse an other. He was the Kings Attorney Generall, in a soueraigne Court, and therfore a publike Accusor; and in this qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, he had power to informe against all such as he knew to be Offendors, without feare of the like punishment. (<hi>L. omnes de dela<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>oribus lib.</hi> 10. <hi>c.</hi>) But he was found vnfur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished of parts required in that place, beeing transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by his passions and surprized in slander. In which case, without respect of his quality and place, hee was subiect to the punishment of a Slanderer. (<hi>L. si cautiones C. de ijs qui accu. non pos.</hi>) Whereas doing his duty accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the necessity of his place, and no otherwise, he needed not to haue feared any thing. And as it is most profitable (as it appeares by the continuall complaints against all sorts of Offendors) to haue speciall men for the defence and preseruation of the common-weale, of Lawes and good manners, and to accuse Malefactors: so it is necessary they be Diligent, Constant, Iust, of a good life and singular integrity. For he that will take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him the charge to accuse, must first examine exactly, and make proofe of his owne life, before hee shall exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and search anothers: and must thinke, that in the end hee shall reape shame and disgrace, in seeking to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:3511:14"/>
cause an other to yeeld an accoumpt of his life, when as he himselfe is subiect to the like triall. In this case the accusers simplicitie imports much: who ought to bee free from hatred, reuenge and other passions, which are contrary to the sinceritie required in those places: for that it is hard to haue a sound iudgement with such pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, the which do hinder the true office of an accuser, which is, that in accusing any one hee should no lesse feare the touch of his owne honor and good name, then the partie accused the preseruation of his life and goods: and the accuser (if he be an honest man) must thinke and beleeue, that in beginning to accuse, he brings his owne honour in question, which should make him carefull not to propound any thing, whereof he is not assured. To this end the (<hi>l. criminis C. de ijs qui accus. non pos.</hi>) is not able and worthy to bee often read, the which comprehends the said parties. It is likely that the Iudges at <hi>Chambery</hi> were linkt together in many things, and that TABOVE being froward, and reiecting some admonitions that were giuen him, framed this accusation against his head and President, who had power to command him, and vnder whom he did exercise his place of Kings Atturney generall, of whom he should haue endured some-thing, considering that the dissimulation of iniuries, which he pretended to haue suffered in his owne particular of the said president, would haue done him more honour, and giuen him greater content, then the reuenge which hee got by a sentence at <hi>Dijon,</hi> although it had taken ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. The conflict of men of that sort is vniust and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humaine: and hath been in old time reproued at <hi>Rome</hi> in many iudgements. L. PHILO seeking to accuse C. SER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VILIVS his Pretor and commander, whose Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:3511:15"/>
he had beene, was not admitted. The like was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudged against M. AVRELIVS for L. FLACCVS his Generall. T. ALBVTIVS had gouerned the <hi>Sardes</hi> a yeare, vnder whome POMPEY was Treasurer. They had carried themselues after different manners: ALBVTIVS like a Theefe, and POMPEY like an honest man. The <hi>Sardes</hi> made their complaints to I. CAESAR, accusing ALBVTIVS, POMPEY hindred, saying, that hee was best reformed of his life, for that he had beene alwayes with him, and serued him as his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer, demanding the charge to accuse him from the which hee was reiected. CICERO in his first accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on against VERRES, to obtaine the place of an Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser, and to keepe Q. CECILIVS, (who presented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe) from audience, he obiected the three principall reasons before mentioned. The first, that hee was not free from blame himselfe, and namely in the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of VERRES, vnder whom hee had had charge in <hi>Sicilia.</hi> The second, that he professed himselfe his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, and therefore transported with affection, which is alwayes to bee suspected. The third, that VERRES is his Commander and Pretor, and therefore cannot bee accused by him, without violating all publike respect of honestie. In the Processe made by NONIVS the black Prouost of <hi>Rome</hi> against CATELYNS confederates, it was taken ill, that the sayd NONIVS in his Interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, had examined the prisoners: if IVLIVS CAESAR (being then Pretor) were not of the conspiracie: for the Pretoriall dignitie which hee then held, the which was one of the highest, and equall with the Consull: for the which the Prouost was blamed and committed to prison, although that one of the prisoners had named
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:3511:15"/>
CAESAR, and that he was presently to prouide for the preseruation of the common-weale, the which might well allowe the accusation of a Magistrate during his time, especially by one of his familie, who had beene commanded. The which the Lawe hath declared intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable, and worthy of punishment, as it appeares in <hi>L. si quis ex familiaribus,</hi> (and in the last law.) <hi>C. de ijs qui accus. non pos:</hi> whereas the Emperours declare such ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions abhominable, excepting no crime but treason.

               </gap>leman of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> found that his wife (issued from a meane parentage, whome hee had married for his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,) forgetting the honour of GOD, the honour which her husband had done her, and her owne honour, had execrably polu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the house, chamber, and bed of her Lord and hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, by continual adultery with a Gentleman his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour whom shee had wickedly allured to her will. The Lord meaning to take the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the fact, &amp; that they might pretend no excuse, hee laied many plots, and among the rest, he caused a packet of letters to be broght vnto him, by the which his Prince called him to Court, meaning to send him into <hi>France,</hi> where hee should remaine some time. He imparts these letters vnto his wife, continues a whole day with her; makes very much of her: acquaints her familiarly with the whole estate of his affaires: leaues her meanes, Iewells &amp; all that was precious in his house; and after a louing faire-wel, he departs with al his traine. At night he staies with one that kept a Castell of his, and descouers vnto him his misfortune and his deseigne. In the meane time this wicked woman had sent for her A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterer, who being shut vp in one chamber, continued their filthy life. The Lord being followed onely by this keeper of his Castell and a grome of his Chamber, well armed, and furnished of all things necessary, in a darke night they came vnto the Castell, where the Chastelane made himselfe knowne vnto the Porter, saying that hee had letters of importance from his Lord, the which he
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:3511:17"/>
must deliuer presently to his Lady. The Porter opes the gate presently to one so well knowne, &amp; sodenly al enter. The Lord forbids the Porter to make any noise, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding him to light a torch, hee goes directly to the Lords Chamber, where the Chastelane did knocke. At this noise, an old woman (who had bin their baude,) as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked who was their? It is I answered the Chastelane, who bring a letter vnto my Lady from my Lord, who passing hastely by my house, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded me to bring it with speed. This woman, dronke with her vilany, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded the old woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to receiue the letter at the dore, without entring, and she would performe the contents. The olde woman opening the doore a little, was sodenly ouerthrowne. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Lord and the two others enter armed, and seize vpon the Adulterers being naked, &amp; confused in their shame. The seruants of the house being sodenly called, the Lord hauing giuen a graue and seuere sentence vpon his detes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Wife, condemned her to hang vp her vilanous A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterer with her owne hands in the presence of them all, hauing bound him hand and foote with halters. This sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance being pronounced, the Lord sent for great Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nales, the which he caused to be knockt vpon a beame in the Chamber, and calling for a ladder, hee forced this wicked woman to tie the halter about her Adulterers necke. And for that she had neede of helpe in this execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, her Baude was condemned to second her. These two togither did hange vp this wretch, after whose death, the Lord caused the bed to be burnt, and all that did participate of their Adulteries, and commanding all the other mouables of the Chamber to be carried away, he left nothing but a little strawe for these two Mastiues to lie on, appointing that the bodie that was hanged,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:3511:18"/>
should remaine there, and that the two women should keepe it, vntill the stinke of it had choakt them: he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the windowes and the dore to be walled vp, leauing onely a little hole, by the which they might giue them bread and water. Hauing past some fewe daies in the stench, without consolation, opprest with griefe and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire they ended their miserable liues.

            <p>In our time an Aduocate of <hi>Grasse</hi> in <hi>Prouence,</hi> called TOLONIO, married a vertuous young Gentlewoman, he managed the affayres of the Signior of <hi>Chabrie.</hi> A Gentleman liuing in a Castle not farre from thence, comming one day among many vnto this Gentlemans house, who was then absent. Hauing familiar ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse to him and to the Lady (who was about fortye yeares old, and the Mother of foure children, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of two were with her, young Gentlemen well bred) he went vp into the Chamber, and found this Lady in bed: beeing set downe by her, after hee had acquainted her with some businesse for the which hee was come vnto the Castle, they entred into strange and detestable dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses, against the honour of GOD, and all respect of honour and vertue.

               </gap>e could not disgest: and seeing his mother could not liue any where without the Aduocate, hee gaue her a graue admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, adding many reasons to excuse his boldnesse. This cursed mother dissembling her rage against her Sonne, complaynes of his conceit, iustifies her selfe impudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: and these drops of water of good and necessary ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, did more inflame the fire of their vnbridled lust. After shee had bitterly reprehended the indiscretion of her Sonne, and highly extolled the Adulterous and Murtherous Aduocate, she forced her sonne to make a submissiue speech vnto him full of excuses. But not content herewith she resolued to kill him. There was a Gallery in the Castle, whereas the yong Gentleman did vsually walke, to behold the Gardin and pleasant coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie about. It was high aduanced, and hung ouer a steepe Rocke, at the foote whereof lay this Garden. The Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocate by the aduice of this cursed Mother, did cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loosen certaine boards in the Gallery, so as the young Gentleman comming soone after in the morning (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his custome) to take the aire of this prospect, set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his foote vpon these disioynted boards, hee fell down head-long where his brains were beaten out. <hi>This was the second murther.</hi>

            <p>A yonger sonne was yet remayning in the house, who doubting nothing that his Mother had beene the cause of these two Parricides, was yet greeued to see the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocates carriage: In the ende hee descouered so much villany in their familiarity, as he held them to bee the cruell murtherers of that noble Familye, making some
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:3511:19"/>
shew of his discontent, to see their brutish conuersation. Hee speakes roughly to the Aduocate, and lookes but sowerly of his Mother. These wicked wretches resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to preuent him, fearing that he would attempt some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing against them. The Aduocate corrupts one in the house with money to murther him, who obserued this young Gentleman so diligently, as one day being a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, whilest his Hunts-men rewarded his Hounds, hee staying vpon the side of a Rocke, which ouer-looked a lowe champian, the descent whereof was very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous towards the valey, by reason of the steepnesse.

They conspire her death, and the Aduocate (hauing many imaginations) lying one night by her, he strangled her with a Napkin, and shee being ready to giue vp the ghost, he began to crie out aloud, and to call for his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants and neighbours to helpe him. They come from all parts, and he cryes and laments, saying, that a violent Catarre had suffocated his wife. The simple and vulgar sort beleeued this report. But the father of this honest Gentlewoman, looking neerely into it, and seeing her face extraordinarily swelled, and her throate black and pale, with other signes of a violent death, seemed to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of their opinions: and hauing perswaded his Sonne in lawe to prouide for his Wiues funerall, hee went
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:3511:19"/>
speedily to the criminall Iudge, and brought him with his officers and some friends, to visit this poore carcase, and to demand Iustice. The Sonne in Lawe being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused, and charged by the Magistrate to answer directly, is mute, and by his silence confesseth the crime: the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions and Surgions hauing giuen their opinion, that the Gentlewoman had been strangled. The Iudge sends this execrable Parricide to prison, who without any torture confesseth the fact. The Parliament of <hi>Aix</hi> aduertised of this fact, sends for him to see him. As for his detestable associate, hauing some notice thereof, she packs vp the greatest wealth she had, and flyes speedily into <hi>Sauoy,</hi> &amp; from thence to <hi>Genoa,</hi> where she changed her name. The Aduocate, being brought to <hi>Aix,</hi> (besides his last Parri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide) confesseth the detestable crimes before mentioned with all the circumstances. He was condemned by a sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Court of Parliament, to bee sent backe to <hi>Grasse,</hi> there to bee quartered aliue in the Market-place, where he was executed, to the great content of his father in Law, and of the whole country. As for that cruell La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of <hi>Chabrie,</hi> shee was condemned by contempt, and executed in picture.

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:3511:22"/>
goes thither with three of his friends, whome hee left in the streete, to hinder any that should come to helpe them then hee enters into the house, with a strong Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-combe of iron, made for the purpose. Hee falls vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Aduocate being naked, and curries him so rudely as he puls the eies out off his head, teares off his stones, and almost all the skin of his body: hee did the like vnto his Wife, although shee was with childe.

            <p>Some yeares before a certaine man making profession to teach chastety to others, did wonderfully importune an honest woman, to depriue her of her honour, &amp; made her to wauer: the husband discontented at this wrong, threatens the other to punish him if hee found him in his house: yet he continues his olde course: so as one daie passing before the doore, the wife (hauing giuen a watch word vnto her husband) began to looke familiarly on him, the which mooued him to followe her euen into her chamber, where the husband enters, who with a naked dagger in his hand, sayd that nowe his time was come for to be gelt, the other changing his feare into fury, fell vpon the husband, takes the dagger from him, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth him to promise that he shall suffer him depart free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Hauing extorted this promise, he leaues his hold, and is so depriued of vnderstanding, as hee laies the dagger, vpon the table. The husband beeing freed, regards not this forced promise, but seazeth sodenly vpon his dagger, and then with a new fury, with the helpe of his wife, laies hold vpon his enemy, binds him fast, and presently
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:3511:22"/>
gelds him, and so sends him home bleeding to his lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, where hauing continued long sicke, in the end hee was cured, but he left running after women.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Germains</hi> wife of <hi>Voitland,</hi> was so vnchast and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent as (of many that did entertaine her) to call three to a banket which shee had prepared for them. But the husband (who had not beene sommoned) came to make it a bloudie feast, for hauing a Pertuisan in his hand, hee entred into the <hi>Stoue,</hi> kills him that was set neerest vnto his wife: runnes after the two other, who being seized on with feare, leape out at the windoes and so kill them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. He returnes to his wife, and perceth her through. A <hi>Germaine</hi> Gentleman hauing dishonestly allured the Wife of a certaine Cittizen, the husband desirous to bee reuenged of this insupportable affront, hid himselfe in a secret corner of his house, and sees his enemy come who continues his insolencies. Night beeing come, these two wretches retier themselues into a chamber, where they sup and lie. The husband comes out of his hole, goes into the kitchin, and being desirous to drinke, he made a noise, in setting the water pot in his place. The wife would haue called vp her seruants, but hearing no more noise, she returned to her Adulterer. In the meane time the husband was entred into the <hi>Stoue,</hi> to take a Caske and his Curirasse. The wife awakes at this noise; she riseth, comes into the <hi>Stoue,</hi> and demands who is there. The husband saieth nothing, but followes her so neere, as he enters sodenly into the Chamber, and at the first kills the Gentleman, notwithstanding any resistance he could make with a Pertuisan, which stood neere vnto his bed. His wife had cast her selfe on the other side of the bed, to whom the husband, (discerning her through

Shee hauing often cryed him mercy comes forth, and not able to pacifie him, she beseecheth him to suffer her to bee confest and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate before she died. Why then, saith he, dost thou repent thee withal thy heart for thy offence. Alas, I: an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered she. At that word he thrust her through with his sword: then laying the one by the other, hee shuts the chamber. The next day all was published, and the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band (charged for this execution) by the aduise of his friends, absented himselfe, least hee should fall into the hands of the Gentlemans friends.</p>

The Marquis desiring to be truly informed of the estate of the <hi>French</hi> Armie, lying then neere vnto him, giues charge vnto LVPON to runne vnto their Campe, to discouer some thing.

With his fore-head (as if it had beene with a hammer of Yron) hee did beate a Naile halfe in into a wall, true it is, that he did hurt himselfe a little with that blowe. Stretching forth his arme, hee did shutte his hand so fast, as those ten men together could not force him to open it, nor to bend his arme. Two theeues finding him alone would haue stayed him: but hee tooke them both by the necks, and beats their heads so violently together, as their braines flew out, and they were found dead in that sort vpon the place. Hee had a pleasing aspect, a quicke eye, and a gratious seuere countenance, not too tall, but well proportioned, and his flesh was so firme and synewie, that when hee did stretch forth his arme, and shutte his hand, it was impossible to pinche him.

In the Parke appointed for Iusts at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> they had raised vp eight hils of sand, of equall heigth and distance, 4. of the one side, &amp; 4. of the other.

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:3511:26"/>
there were posts set<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the foure of the one side hauing round blankes at the end, and the other foure had Ouals, all made of Lether and Paper very artificially. These were the markes where at these fifty horsemen did aime, who began to march easily by this way, first in troupe, and then in rankes, as it were in Battell. Sodenly they dis-band, and begin to runne with a full carrier, one after another, so neere and so iustly, as one was at anothers heeles. In running they tooke their Arrowes out of their quiuers, and shot with such dexteritie, as they did hit the markes so swiftly, as the beholders eyes could not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the shotte nor the blowes. At the second course, whereas they had shotte but at the round blankes, they now deliuered their Arrowes against both, with a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull dexteritie, some-times vsing the left hand, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the right-hand, with one motion: for the third charge, in shooting off their Arrowes, they some-times discouered the right shoulder, som-times the left, with their Targets, &amp; that with an incredible swiftnes. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, in running a full carrier, they drew out their Cymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and cut these round markes, and carried away the walls, the which was done in one course. Then turning head sodenly, they shott against the markes, &amp; with their Cymiters, which they drew out againe, they beate them downe, and sodenly they bend their bowes againe, and shoote into the ayre. They did wonders with their halfe pikes, in diuers kinds of Combates, and in the end they made euen these hills with their Cymiters, pulling away those stakes that were set vpon the hills of Sand; they cast them into the ayre, and in running, they receiued them againe, and held them in their hands. Then standing vpon their feete in the Saddle, they began to

runne, and to handle their Cymiters, bowes and staues as before, without any further repetition of these parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularities, I will noate one notable Act, the which perchance wilbe held a fiction: but I did see it. Of these fifty there were two goodly yong men which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drewe themselues from the rest. The one stood vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in his saddle, and bare his companion standing vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his armes. Beeing in this posture, they runne the horse a full carrier, and yet stood fast, yea the vppermost shot certaine arrowes at a peele of wood which he that carried him held in his right hand. Moreouer these two hauing tied two horses togither by the bridle, one of them set one foote vpon one saddle and an other vpon the other, standing as firmely vpon both as if they had beene glued togither, and carrying his Companion vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right vpon his armes, and holding in his hand that peele of woode, against the which the other standing aloft, shot without missing, whilest that the two horses did r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>There were others which hauing sixe naked Cymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters tied the points vpward, vnto their saddles, set their heads into the saddle, and their heeles vpward and in this sort did runne their horses so swiftly, as you would say they had flowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Besides their were two that did sit in one saddle, and as the horse did runne in his full speed, they would leape downe and vp againe presently.

which Lanciers are accustomed to do in their Courses on hors-backe.

Sometimes hee leaped vpon the Roape with both feete, sometimes with one, then imbracing the Roape with both his feete, he hung downe-ward, and turning about, raised himselfe againe. Hee did slide with a strange resolution, from the toppe vnto the bottome, and that which I esteeme most in this agilety, at night he would tie sixe naked Cymiters to either foote, and continued his sport by torch-light with such admiration and applause of all the world, as if happely any of the Spectators had desire to sleepe, this man by his admirable agility did

Sometimes he would fight with mastiues &amp; great <hi>English</hi> dogs which his Prince had, and by a certaine counterfet barking and a furious doggish snarling, he would make them runne away. This done he would bound vpon his hands and his feete, with a wonderfull agility clyming vp, at the Corners and on the wainscot of the hall more nimbly then an Ape although otherwise hee was rude, big, and of a heauy moulde. I did twise see (being at the Princes table) after that he had cast downe the Dwarfe, and chased away the dogges he leaped vpon one of the guests shoulders, and from thence to the Table, without ouerthrowing of dish or goblet, and then hee leaped so sodenly downe, as you would haue iudged him to haue beene a squirrell or a wild-cat; Hee would vsually

runne as fast vpon the toppes of houses built pointed and sloape, as our house Catts would do.

The sixt daye about nine of the clocke at night, the Moone appeared full, trauersed with a Crosse, compassed in with a Circle, and aboue it a halfe Circle. On the seauenth, at the breake of day, were seene three Sunnes againe: and from sixe of the clock vntill seauen a Rain-bowe with three Moones.

And for that there hath beene often mention made, and shall be againe of the appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of three Sunnes, which they call Paralies. I will tell you what it is, with their generation and signification. About the true S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>nne created by GOD, and making his limitted course in the midest of Heauen, there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in the clouds certaine lights, the which in bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and forme resemble the Sunne in such sort; as one would say they were very Sunnes, so as you can hardly discerne the true from these imaginarie ones, called <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralies, Para Helios,</hi> as one would say, neere or right a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Sunne. For such shining Images, and fashio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned like the Sunne, seeme to be right against it, although they bee many thousand miles vnder it: for the Sunne is in the middest of the Heauens, and the Paralies are in the ayre. Some-times by this name they vnderstand the likenesse of the Moone. And when they appeare, PLINIE sayes they are called night-Sunnes. It is most certaine, that they are made in the clouds, and not in the firmament, which can receiue no such impressions, by reason of their thinnesse, and continuall transparent brightnesse which hath no bounds. There is no figure
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:3511:33"/>
but must bee receiued in a body that is limited by some meanes whatsoeuer. Those things which are made in the Heauens, last and continue: but contrariwise the Parelies vanish soone. Neither are they in the very ayre, which is transparent and not limitted, yet they seeme to be in the ayre, the which is the receptacle of exhalati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and clouds: so as the Pareleis are fashioned in the clouds. Besides the cloud where they are made, must be some-what thick, equall and moist, to make a body, wherein the forme of the Sunne or Moone must be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and of a meane thicknesse, for if it did abound, it could not receiue this impression. It must also be vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted like vnto a Looking-glasse, else there can be no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation. And moyst, that the brightnesse and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance may pierce into it, to make a reflexion. Such Images cannot bee receiued but in transparent bodies.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, this clowd must bee opposite to the Sunne, to receiue and represent the whole face of it, the which should appeare but by halues, if it were on the one side, or not at all, if the Sunne should shine di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly aboue the clowd. The reflexion also of the beames is necessary: for if they did pierce through the clowde, there would no Image appeare. The ayre must also bee calme and without agitation. For if the windes did blowe, the clowde would bee sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and so nothing disposed to receiue any such im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression. As you cannot see your face in the waues of a floud, but easily in a cleere and calme Water, the which is limitted in a Basin or other vessell. If the Sunne shines in such sort, as there is any reflection of the beams you shall see the resemblance of the Sunne in this water,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:3511:34"/>
euen as in a Looking-glasse. The like is seene in a cloud compounded of water, as hath beene sayd naturally, these like or seeming Moones, are signes of Raine: for that they are not conge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>led but in cloudes that are of a reasonable thicknesse. Such clouds are matter for raine. Supernaturally, they are forerunners of the iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of GOD, punishing the World with Plague, Warre and Famine: <hi>As we haue seene in our Times.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the same yeare 1527. There was a great noise heard in the ayre, as of Armed men, that gaue Battaile. Soone after the Sunne shining in a cleare skie, it was so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainely enuironed with a great cloudie Circle. In the yeare 1528. about mid-May ouer the towne of <hi>Zurich,</hi> there were 4. seeming-Moones seene, enuironed with 2. whole Circles, and the Sunne compassed in with fower small Circles.

            <p>The ninth of Ianuary 1529. about ten of the clocke at night, there was seene in <hi>Germanie</hi> an opening of the Heauen, described by IOVIANVS PONTANVS in his Meteors. Two yeares after ouer <hi>Lisbone</hi> in <hi>Portugall,</hi> were seene fiery and bloudy apparitions in the Heauens, and soone after there fell many droppes of bloud out off the Clouds vpon the Earth. The eleuenth of Aprill 1542. about seuen of the clocke in the morning, there were seene three Sunnes distinctly shining at <hi>Venice,</hi> with two rain-bowes opposite to the Sunne.

Those seeming were so resplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, as Mans eye could not endure to looke on them, no more then of the brightnesse of the true Sunne, but that of the left hand towards the South, did shine more then the other looking towards the North, the which continued longer, and was more resplendent in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clyning. They were of a reddish colour, extending their beames verye farre in the Ayre, euen vnto the Earth. About the ende of the same month of Aprill in the same yeare, there was seene in <hi>Suisserland</hi> a great white circle shining like cristall. In many Prouinces of <hi>Europe</hi> there were Dragons seene flying in the Ayre in great troupes, sometimes to the number of foure hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, hauing all royall Crownes vpon their heads: and their heads were like vnto those of Swine, especially the groine. Those of <hi>Munster</hi> in <hi>West phalia,</hi> did see in the day time, the skie being cleare and bright, an armed Knight running in the ayre.</p>
            <p>The great commander of <hi>Malta,</hi> caused to be publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed in the yeare 1532.

About the seuenth of March a Woman na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med RACHIENNE was brought in bed of a goodly Sonne, which had the Eyes sparkling, and the Teeth shining. At the same instant that he was borne, Heauen and Earth were strangely moued, the Sunne did shine as bright at midnight as at noone-daye, and in the day time it was so darke, as from morning vntill night they could
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:3511:35"/>
not see any thing in all that country. Then afterwards he shewed himselfe, but of an vnaccustomed forme, with diuers newe starres wandring vp and downe. Ouer the house where this infant was borne, besides other prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, fier fell from heauen, which slue some persones. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the eclipse of the Sunne there happened a horrible tempest in the Aire: then there fell pearles from heauen. The next day they might see a fiery dragon flie through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all that Clymat. Moreouer there appeared a newe Mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taine, higher then any other, the which did prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly diuide it selfe into two parts, and in the midest of them appeared a colomne or piller, where there was a certaine writing in Greeke, shewing that the end of the world ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proched, then was there a voice herd in the aire, exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, euery one to prepare himselfe. The Child hauing li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued two moneths, began to speake like one of yeares, &amp; by diuers delusions, growes into such credit, as hee was adored &amp; worshiped as a GOD, discouering it selfe to be an euill spirit, the which had a great force of error in al those Countries.

            <p>The 7. of February 1536 about two of the clocke, after mid-night, there was seene in the Element, ouer one quarter of <hi>Spaine,</hi> two armed men, running one at an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their swords drawne the one carried on his left arme a target, on the which was painted an Eagle, with this <hi>Motto</hi> about it <hi>Regnabo,</hi> that is to say I will raigne. The other had a great target with a starre &amp; a Cressant, and this inscriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Regnaui.</hi> I haue raigned. He that Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the Eagle ouerthrew the other. The like Combate was seene in <hi>Hongary</hi> 20. yeares after, the which we will note in order. In the yeare 1537. the first of February there was seene in <hi>Italy</hi> an Eagle flying in the aire, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the right foote a bottle, &amp; in the left a serpent wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed vp: being followed by an infinit number of others. At the same time also there was a <hi>Bourguignon</hi> crosse of diuers collours seene in the aire. 15. daies before there was seene in <hi>Franconia,</hi> betwixt <hi>Bamberg</hi> &amp; the forest of <hi>Turinge,</hi> a star of huge greatnesse, the which declyning by degrees, turned into a great white circle, out of the which soone after proceeded great gusts of winde &amp; flas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes of fire, which falling to the ground, did melt the heads of pikes and the bitts of horses, without hurting of man or house. In the yeare 1538. there were seene in the aire, ouer diuers parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> armed men figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and as it were killing one an other.</p>
            <p>Towardes the East there did shine a Starre of an
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:3511:36"/>
vnaccustomed bignesse, hauing beames as red as bloud, and neere vnto it a bloudie crosse and a flying Standard. Two yeares after was seene an other starre in the clouds, very bright, as at the breake of day, it appeared the 25. of December. The next day there came out of the Moone two twinckling Starres shyning very bright.</p>
            <p>There was seene in the yeare 1541. three Sunnes, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed in with a Rainbowe. The yeare following, there were seene in <hi>Saxony,</hi> Rodds and Torches of fire. In the yeare 1544. the 7. of April at eight of the clocke at night, the skie being very cleere, there were seene ouer a little Towne in <hi>Suissarland,</hi> called <hi>Wilen Turgau,</hi> in the face of the Moone, a white crosse shyning very bright, the foure ends whereof (especially the nethermost) did farre passe beyond the face of the moone. Two daies after there was seene ouer <hi>Golaries</hi> in <hi>Suissarland,</hi> an houre before Noone, the skie beeing very cleere, a great white circle shyning, wherof the Center from the right part vnto the left, was enuironed with a Rainbowe, as it doth vsually appeere. This circle turned at foure of the clocke right before the midest of the rondell of the Sunne. The 29. of March 1545. about eight of the clock in the morning, there fell about <hi>Cracouia</hi> a flash of lightning after a horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thunder, so as al <hi>Poland</hi> was troubled thereat. Present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after there appeared three red crosses in the Element, betwixt the which there was a man armed at all parts, who with a burning sword did fight with an army, the which he defeated, and therevpon came a horrible drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which swallowed vp this victorious man: prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly the heauens did open as they had beene all on fire, &amp; so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for an houres space. Then there appeered three Rain-bowes in their accustomed collours, vpon the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:3511:36"/>
highest of which there was the forme of an Angell, as they do represent them in the shape of a yong man, that hath wings at his shoulders, holding a Sunne in one of his hands and a Moone in the other. This second specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle hauing continued halfe an houre in the viewe of all those that would behold it, certaine cloudes did rise which did couer these apparitions.</p>
            <p>In base <hi>Hongary,</hi> there was seene in the yeare 1546. for the space of a whole houre, the heauens open, from the which did fall great aboundance of fire, vpon this fier there appeered a blacke Oxe, the which seemed to pisse fire. Aboue <hi>Belgeen</hi> a Towne in <hi>Misnia,</hi> and the Country about was seene an other opening of Heauen, the which continued two houres in the night the 10. of February, and cast forth beames euen vnto the earth. At the same time were seene three burning Cheurons, and of diuers collours, flying in the Aire. In the yeare 1547. there was seene aboue <hi>Halberstad</hi> in <hi>Saxony,</hi> a blacke boule comming out of the midest of the Moone, and running violently towards the North. The 15. day of December the same yeare, the Mariners of <hi>Hambourg,</hi> did see in the element at mid-night, a burning globe and shyning as the Sunne, rowling towards the South, whose beames were so hot, as the passengers could not abide vpon the hatches, but were forced to hide themselues thinking the shippes would bee set on fier. They did also see in <hi>Suisserland,</hi> two armies in the Aire, fighting togither. And two ramping Lions fighting, whereof the one pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of the others head with his teeth. Aboue them ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peered a white Crosse stretched out in length, hauing the lower end fashioned like a whippe. The same yeare the twelfeth of Aprill and the two following, presently after
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:3511:37"/>
noone the Sunne was seene in his Spheare, like vnto a globe of fire, and at Noone-day the Starres appeered. Ten daies after, which was the 24. in <hi>Saxony, Turin, Suis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serland, France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> the Sunne appeared with a cloudie and bloudie Countenance, for the space of foure houres, to the great amazement of many. It continued in this sort some other daies following. The first daies of October following, about seauen of the clocke in the morning, there was seene in <hi>Saxony,</hi> the forme of a dead mans Beere, couered with a blacke cloth and a Crosse vpon it of a reddish collour, accompanied both before and behinde with many figures of men in mourning weeds, either of them carrying a Trumpet wherewith they began to sound so loude as the Inhabitants of the Country did easily vnderstand the noise. In the meane time there appeared a man all armed, and of a terrible aspect, who drawing out his sword cut off part of the cloath and then with his hands he tare in peeces the rest which done, both hee and all the rest vanished. In December the same yeare, about <hi>Rome</hi> there appeared in the aire, three daies togither, about three of clocke in the afternoone, a beesome as it were dipt in bloud, and a red Crosse, ouer the which did houer an Eagle. In the moneth of May precedent: about <hi>Saxony</hi> and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisate of <hi>Brandebourg,</hi> were seene two Globes of fire, leaping about the Sunne, the greatest of them did so co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the Sunne, as at Noone-day, it seemed as it were rus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. They did also see the same yeare a furious Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate of two armies in the aire ouer the Towne of <hi>Quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delbourg.</hi>

               <hi>Rosensel</hi> a Towne of the Duchie of <hi>Wirtemberg:</hi> and in this Moone was seene an arme of a blackish collour, with a hand stretched out: soone after the Moone hauing recouered her vsuall light, it was againe seene with three Cheurons or large barres of the same collour that the arme was, which did crosse it distinctly. These barres be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vanished, there appeered a <hi>Bourguignon</hi> crosse, black, vnderneth the Moone, at the two sides there appee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red two other smal rondells. The yeare following, which was 1549. in the morning, the Sunne being very bright, in the moneth of May, vpon a quarter of <hi>Germany,</hi> there was seene in the aire the figure of a man, attired like a <hi>Germaine</hi> Prince, aboue the which, there appeered on the other side a Lion and a Sheepe, which seemed to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace one an other willingly: before this Prince was a great garland of flowers, the which he would haue taken in his hand, but not being able, he tooke vp a sword, the which was vnder his feete from the beginning, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he florished twise or thrise about his head, and then all vanished into the cloudes. In the yeare 1550. were seene in the night, ouer the Towne of <hi>Lipsick</hi> in <hi>Misnia</hi> three Globes of fire. And in August the same yeare, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Nuremberg,</hi> the skie being very cleere, the Sunne was seene of diuers collours, and ouer it a vessell, the which leaning on the one side, there came forth bloud, where-with the Sunne was made redde. On the other side there appeered an Eagle with his wings spred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad of diuers collours, but without any feete. A little beneath the Sunne and the Eagle, was a Raine-bowe, and directly vnderneth it was a Man, holding a horse by the bridle with his left hand, and with his right <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

During this conflict there fell a shower of bloud vpon the Earth, the Sonne appeared ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie hiddeous and as it were out of his course, diuided in two and in shewe approching neere the Earth. Some weekes before, there was seene almost in the same place, a bloudy sword in the Aire, and a peece of Ordinance, mounted vpon wheeles. The 24. of Iune betwixt sixe and nine in the morning, the time being very cleere, there was seene in the Element, a blacke Crosse with a Iauelin, hauing a fish-hooke at one of the ends, and at the other three small barres like vnto rests. Ouer <hi>Lisbone</hi> in <hi>Portugall,</hi> there appeered the 28. of Ianuary 1551. a great handfull of bloudie roddes, with fearefull fiers: it rayned bloud, and there followed Earth-quakes, so as two hundred houses were shaken and ouerthrowne, whereby aboue a thousand persons were slaine. The 21. day of March, about 7. of the clocke in the morning, there were seene at <hi>Magdebourg</hi> seauen Rain-bowes and three Sunnes; and at night three Moones, whereof that in the midest, which was the right, kept her ordinary col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, the other two were of the collour of bloud. These three Sunnes were also seene at <hi>Witenberg</hi> in <hi>Saxony,</hi> with ten or twelue Circles that did inuiron them, some round, others but halfe and very spatious, others lesse, and some very smal, almost all of the collour of the Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bowe. The last daie of February, which was three weekes before, those of <hi>Antwerp</hi> in <hi>Brabant</hi> had also seene three Sunnes, inclosed in diuers Circles and Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bowes.</p>

               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:3511:38"/>In the yeare 1552. the 19. of February, about three of the clock in the afternoone, those of <hi>Maclin</hi> in <hi>Brabant,</hi> did see the Sunne first of a blew coulour, then red, enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roned with a great circle and a Rain-bowe. About ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen moneths after, the 23. of Ianuary 1553<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> about eight of the clock at night, there was seene at <hi>Basil,</hi> the Moone enuironed with a great &amp; cleere circle, of the coulour of the Rainbow, the which continued three whole houres. In Iune following, there were seene in the ayre, being cleere and bright, ouer the Towne of <hi>Cobourg,</hi> betwixt fiue and sixe at night, diuers sorts of men, then armies which gaue battaile, &amp; an Eagle houering with her wings abroad. In Iuly were seene two Serpents ioyned together one eating of an other, and betwixt them a fierie crosse. The same yeare the Citty of <hi>Magdebourg</hi> was straightly besieged, &amp; among other maruailes, the day after Easter the Sunne appeared very bright at the rising, and enuiro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with a great circle as white as milke, the which were crost with foure Rain-bowes, the goodliest that euer was seene. Ten dayes before, betwixt seauen and eight of the clock in the morning, were seene ouer the same Towne, three Sunnes: the right had his ordinary brightnesse, the other two had a bloudy colour. Hauing continued al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most the whole day, at night there appeared 3. Moones, whereat all the Inhabitants of the place were much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed, they were of diuers colours: and after they had continued some houres, the two apparant Moones or Paralies, became red as bloud, then dispersing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues into long streames, in the end they vanished: the right Moone which was in the middest, retained her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed brightnes. The same yere died Duke GEORGE Prince of <hi>Anhalt,</hi> an excellent Diuine. The day of his

A few dayes before the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, giuen betwixt MAVRICE Duke of <hi>Saxonie,</hi> and ALBERT Marquis of <hi>Brandebourg,</hi> there appeared the image of a great man in a place of <hi>Saxonie:</hi> from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of this man, which appeared naked, first there began bloud to fall from him, drop after drop: then they did see sparkes of fire come from him, and in the end he va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished by little and little. In Ianuary 1554. there appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red three Sunnes twise in <hi>Saxony.</hi> The 1. of February fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, about <hi>Chalons</hi> in <hi>Champagne,</hi> was seene a great flame of fire, which went from the East to West, like to a burning Torche, bending as a Cressent, the fire did crack, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ast out sparkes of all sides, like vnto a barre of Yron comming out of the Furnaise, which the Smiths did worke with their Hammers. Some adde that this Torche appeared about the Moone, and shewed the point of a Lance at one end. The 19. of February. were seene at <hi>Nebre,</hi> two Crosses of a blew coulour. And the same day at <hi>Greisen</hi> in <hi>Turinge,</hi> they did see in the Sunne which shined brightly, a blew Crosse, so great as it couered all the face of the Sunne: on either side it had a great Cheuron of fire, with diuers Circles. The 9. day of Aprill, aboue <hi>Sultzfield,</hi> halfe a dayes iourney neere vnto <hi>Schuinfort,</hi> an Imperiall Towne, there appeared two Moones in the night. In Marche before, were seene Sunnes of diuers greatnesse, with some Circles in <hi>Bauaria</hi> and the Countrie about. First the 6. of Marche betwixt eyght and nine of the clock in the morning, were seene two Sunnes with a Raine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bowe. The 23. of the same moneth, about an houre after-noone, those of <hi>Nuremberg</hi> did see as much: and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:3511:39"/>
moreouer a Raine-bowe towards the West, and the Sunnes enuironed with white Circles, continued three houres together, with a long burning Cheuron. The eight day following, there were three Sunnes seene at <hi>Reinsbourg.</hi> Their beginning was about an houre after noone: betwixt two and three they did shine brightly, and ended at foure of the clocke. They did cast out beames of the one side like vnto a Commet: that in the middest towards the North, and the other two to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the East and West.</p>
            <p>In Marche the same yeare, were seene ouer diuers Townes in <hi>Germanie,</hi> betwixt foure and fiue of the clock at night, diuers <hi>Bourguignon</hi> Crosses, but most white, and in a manner touching one another. The 23. day of the same moneth, a little before Sunne sett, were seene two Parelies enuironed with the Sunne by a great Circle ouer the Village of <hi>Blech.</hi> Not farre from <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remberg</hi> the eleuenth of Iune, there appeared a Rodde of a bloudie colour through the Sunne, with Starres or Boules of Azure. Presently after there were seene two Squadrons of armed men, the which had blew Cornets, who for the space of two houres, incountred together furiously, to the great amazement of many which did see the beginning, the continuance and end of this apparition. The 13. of Iune, about fiue of the clocke in the after-noone, ouer the Towne of <hi>Iene,</hi> the Sunne was seene of a bloudie colour, to whom there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proched presently from the South and West, great and many boules of fire, the which did darken the light of it. And then appeared two Cheurons of a very red colour, crossing through the Sunne. The 24. day of Iuly, about ten of the clock at night, there appeared in the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:3511:40"/>
ayre, in that quarter of the Country which is called the high <hi>Palatinat</hi> of <hi>Rhine.</hi> Towards the forrest of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> two men armed with all peeces, the one being of a farre taller stature then the other, hauing on his brest a bright shining starre, and a flaming sword in his hand, as also the lesser had.

In the end they both vanished away.</p>
            <p>The 5. of August following, at 9. of the clock at night, neere vnto <hi>Stolpen,</hi> in the South part of Heauen, there appeared troupes of warlike men, who with great cryes and noise of armes, charged one another furiously, when the first charge was ended, there came aboundance of fire out of the clouds, which hindred the sight of these troupes. This fire vanishing, they returned to the second charge: then the fire kindling againe, you would haue said it had beene a kind of retreat, to rally themselues againe together on either part: which ended, they returne againe to a third charge, the which being done, they all vanished. The same yere at <hi>Fribourg</hi> in <hi>Misnia,</hi> was seene in the open day, the representation of our Lord IESVS CHRIST, as many Painters are accustomed to represent him, sitting in a Rain-bow, the colours whereof were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding liuely. And about another towne called <hi>Zopodee,</hi> the Sun rising appeared as red as bloud, hauing about it a stately Pallace, the which was all on fire. On either side of the Sunne was seene a high columne, very artificiall fashioned and of the coulour that the Raine-bowe. It seemed that their foundations did touch the ground,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:3511:40"/>
and were very large. The next day the Sunne did rise with a pale coulour, and this Pallace was aboue it shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning very brightly. The columnes or pillers also appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, but not so faire and long as the day before. The 10. of February 1555. there were three Sunnes seene at <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naire</hi> in <hi>Saxonie.</hi> And the 13. of March, there appeared in the ayre about <hi>Turinge</hi> a fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth of Ianuary 1556. towards the Mountaines which compasse in the Citty of <hi>Ausbourg</hi> of the one side, the element did open, and seemed to riue, whereat all were wonderfully amazed: especially by reason of the pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full accidents which followed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the same day the mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger of <hi>Ausbourg</hi> slue a Captaine at the Citty gates with a Pistoll. The next day, the wife of one that made sword blades, thinking to get a great booty, slue a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant in her house: and presently after her seruant killed her selfe with a Knife. A day after, a Butcher was slaine in a quarrell: and two villages were quite burnt. The 15. day of the same moneth, the Keeper of S. <hi>Katherins</hi> forrest was found dead, being shotte through with an Harguebuse. The 17. a Gold-smiths man falling into dispaire, drowned himselfe. The night following many were wounded to the death in the streete. I had forgot to note, that the same eleuenth day of Ianuary, when the Heauens did open about <hi>Ausbourg,</hi> there happened such a change in the aire about <hi>Mickhuse</hi> in <hi>Bauicre,</hi> and so great a light appeared in the night, as it did obscure the light of Candles in their shops and houses, so as for three houres space, those which would worke, had no need of any other light then that of Heauen. Some moneths af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the Heauens began to open in another part of <hi>Swau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:3511:41"/>

            <p>In diuers dayes and moneths of the same yeare 1556. were obserued other apparitions: as in February in the County of <hi>Bats,</hi> there were seene in the ayre armies of foote and horse, the which did incounter together furiously. In September, ouer a little Towne in the Marquisate of <hi>Branaebourg,</hi> called <hi>Custerin,</hi> about nine of the clocke at night, they did see infinite flames of fire comming out of the ayre, and in the middest two great burning Cheurons. In the ende there was a voice heard crying, <hi>Miserie, Miserie vnto the Church.</hi> Wee haue sayd before that in the yeare 1536. there had beene seene in the ayre in <hi>Spaine</hi> a Combate of two young men. VVLFGANG STRANCH of <hi>Nuremberg</hi> writes, that in the yeare 1556. ouer a Towne in <hi>Hungarie,</hi> the which he calles <hi>Babatcha,</hi> there was seene the 6. of Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, a little before Sunne rising, the resemblance of two naked boyes fighting in the ayre, with Cymiters in their hands, and Targets vpon their armes. Hee which carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a spred Eagle vpon his shield, did charge the other which carryed a Cressant so furiously, as it seemed the body being wounded in many places, did fall from the Heauen to the Earth.</p>
            <p>At the same time, and in the same place, was seene a Raine-bow with his accustomed colours, and at the end thereof two Sunnes. Not farre from <hi>Ausbourg,</hi> there was seene in the ayre a Combate betwixt a Beare and a Lion, in December the same yeare: And at <hi>Witten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg</hi> in <hi>Saxony</hi> the 6. of the same moneth, three Sunnes,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:3511:41"/>
and a crooked clowd, marked with blew and red, stretcht forth like vnto a bowe, the Sunne shewing pale and sad, betwixt the Paralies or seeming Sunnes: foure mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths before three Sunnes had beene seene betwixt <hi>Eus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choin</hi> and <hi>Basill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Touching the significations of all these apparitions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I will not meddle with them.

In the which certaine <hi>Spanish</hi> Captaines with their companies, who striuing to make it good vpon the dis-route, got nothing but blowes, and were in a manner all cut in peeces and slaine vpon the place. Those which suruiued laie still and did counterfet themselues dead. Of this number there were two Captaines, the one called ALPHONSO, the other MANRIC, both were <hi>Castillians.</hi> AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHONSO had seauen wounds with a Courtelas vpon the head, his caske hauing beene beaten of and hee ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown: foure of them had entred into his head, the other three had but cut the flesh vnto the boane: on either arme hee had foure great cutts, two about one of his Elbowes and his wrist, besides hee had sixe thrustes in his thighes. Hee and MANRIC with 260. others that were wounded did saue themselues as they could and were carried to <hi>Arles</hi> a neere Towne, where they were drest. MANRIC, had manie wounds in the head, armes, brest, sides and face, contynuing two daies without speech or pulce. In flying hee had cast himselfe into the Riuer of <hi>Rohan,</hi> where hee had remayned in the Water vppe to the chyne, for the space of 4. houres, sometimes lifting vp his head, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times playing the Diue-dopper, vntill the night was
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:3511:54"/>
come, and the victors being retyred, he swamme ouer the riuer. Aboue a hundred others that were wonded did striue to passe the riuer, desyring rather to hazard themselues in that sort, then to fall into the hands of the <hi>French,</hi> who were iustly incensed against them. But ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them were drowned, their strength fayling them in the midest of the waues. Those which escaped halfe dead, died in a manner all in the Hospitall at <hi>Arles.</hi> The two aboue named Captaines, after they had endured newe deathes in the hands of Surgions and Physitions, were after some weekes set on foote againe, but well marked in diuers places to serue for a remembrance and an example to their Countrymen, who notwithstanding haue not well considered of it. MANRIC had receiued two thrusts with a Halbard betwixt the ribbes, but there came not much matter out of his wounds: but at the ende of three weekes hee voided aboundance of rotten filthe by his fondement, to the great amazement of the Physitions, for that from the brest vnto the gutts there is no common passage, for any corrupt matter that is in the sayd brest. In the same Battayle a foote-man had a shot with a Harguebuse, the which peerst the lest Temple, and came out on the other side a little vnder the right Temple, hauing shattered his head in two: yet he was miraculously cured. He had beene drest at <hi>Nismes,</hi> but finding himselfe not well cured, he came to mee, and I did succor him with my best skill. Yet he contynued blinde and deafe of this wounde. Neither the braine nor the filme of it had not beene toucht, but the boullet hauing broken the head had past close by it vnto the other side. Moreouer, by reason of the blowe and the contusion, some little bloud dispersing it selfe into the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:3511:54"/>
sinnews of the sight and hearing, it caused an obstructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereof followed a blindnesse and deafnesse. An other borne at <hi>Marseilles,</hi> being Ancient to a company, had a Harquebuse shot in the brest, so as the Bullet came forth at his back, and yet he was cured.</p>
            <p>Another of <hi>Arles,</hi> had his head halfe cut off with a Courtelas, so as it had neede to be propt vp, the blowe being giuen betwixt the first and second <hi>Vertebre</hi> (a ioint in the body, where the ioynts so meete, that they may turne as in the hucle-bone) so deepe and so large, as they might lay their hand in it, yet hee was cured, and liued foure yeares after this wonderfull wound. Another cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led CLAVDE of <hi>Sauoy,</hi> hauing his head almost cleft in two with a Courtelas, he neuer had feuer nor any other accident (the which are vsuall in such like wounds) but the broken bones being taken out according vnto Arte, in two moneths he was cured. Two others, the one ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his thigh all broken in peeces with a Faucon shott, (the bullet whereof was drawne out of it,) and the other wounded in the Ancle, after they had suffered much, were cured, without cutting of thigh or leg.

In an incounter neere vnto <hi>Cisteron,</hi> a Gentleman called the Cadet of <hi>Monstier,</hi> was shot with a Harguebuse, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the fift and sixt rib: the Bullet crost his brest, and came forth within two fingers of the back bone. There
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:3511:55"/>
were drawne forth with the Bullet; twelue ringles of a shirt of Mayle which this Gentleman did weare: ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie others ringles of the same side, remained among the Muscles, betwixt the ribbes and the backe, and some others driuen into the body came forth with the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the wound, whereof hee was cured within a yeare. But hee had a difficultie in breathing, the which continued the remainder of his dayes, by reason of this wound. A seruant belonging to the Seigneur of <hi>Meianes</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Arles,</hi> being shot in the right arme, in the same incounter, betwixt the elbow and the shoulder, and ill handled by the Surgions that were in the Armie, he came to <hi>Arles,</hi> hauing his Arme putrified and stink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so strongly, as no man could endure him, it was all black, soft, and extreamly colde, the patient falling som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times into a swound. The Surgions being assembled with me, wee resolued to cut off his Arme speedily, to saue the rest of the body. Hauing therefore with a Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor cut his Arme aboue the dead flesh, they cut the bone in sunder with a Sawe, and stopt the Flux of bloud with Canters fitte for it: so as within one moneth the man was cured. VALLERIOLA <hi>in the same Obseruation.</hi> At the same incounter, a Prouencall Souldier was shott into the arme with a Musket, the which brake the bones and did so teare all the rest, as the Arme did not hold by the thicknesse of ones finger, from falling. All the Surgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were of opinion to cutt it off, except one called Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster DIDIER TESTE, a man very expert in his Arte, who in one moneth cured this Souldier, who had in a manner all the motions of this Arme thus tattered, whole and sound. An other Souldiar stroken with an Harguebuse shotte in the face, the Bullet entring at the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:3511:55"/>
mouth, and comming forth at the left side, towards the left Temple, hauing broken the vpper Iawe-bone, yet he was well cured.</p>
            <p>A certaine Porter in the Towne of <hi>Arles,</hi> falling to be a Souldiar in an incounter, he receiued a thrust three fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers vnder the Nauell, on the left side, giuen with such force, as it pierced vnto the backe, betwixt the third and forth ribbe neere vnto the bone: yet hee was cured by the aboue named Surgion. Wee haue (saith VALLE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIOLA) held these aboue-named cures worthy the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, that none should despaire of difficult things, nor be too confident of those which seeme light. For that sometimes wee see him dye, whome the Physitions as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured to see soone recouered, and him to escape, of whome they had lost all hope. And that both Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (and all others that shall read these Accidents) may remember that wonders do fall out in such wounds and cures, as in other workes of Nature, to the praise of Almighty GOD.</p>
            <p>In the warre of <hi>Sauoy</hi> 1589. and following: a young Souldier had a Harguebuse shotte in the fore-head, and the Bullet remained in his head. Hee was had in cure by an expert Surgion, so as within few moneths hee retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded againe to Armes. And in a certaine Scallado, being falne from a high wall into a ditch, hee did so bruze his head, as hee dyed. The Bullet which remained of the precedent wound, was found in the hinder part of his head, without hurting of any part about it. <hi>Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of our time.</hi>

Being in his Chamber, and reasonably well entertained, hee perceiued the seruant to weepe, and did secretly vnderstand from her, in what danger hee was. She told him among other things that the Hoasts custome was to ring a little Bell, at which sound many theeues entred into the lodging, and present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie one among them entred into the Chamber, whereas the passengers were lodged, who making a shew to snuffe the Candle, should put it out: then the theeues entred, and falling vpon the passengers, slew them. CONRAD bethinking himselfe, caused a Lanthorne to bee brought him by the seruant, and a Candle light in it, the which he hid vnder a bench, held his wepons rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and attended his enemies. He was scarse set at the Table, but a peasant enters, who counterfetting the varlet, puts out the Candle. But CONRAD causing the Lantherne with the light to bee presently drawne

forth, and hauing his armes and his seruants ready, hee valiantly resists these theeues, slue some, put the rest to flight, layes hold vpon his Host, and deliuers him vnto the Magistrate, who caused him to bee executed. <hi>The same Author.</hi> Some yeares past, I did see broken vpon the wheele by the iudgement and sentence of the Bayliffe of <hi>Morges</hi> (vnder the gouernment of the Seigneurie of <hi>Berne</hi>) a young man, about the age of twenty yeares, who counterfetting himselfe dumbe, and asking almes of passengers, vnder colour of passing on his way with a little Bell in his hand, which was as a watch-word to his companions (the number of the stroakes making them to discerne the number of the persons and their qualities) was found to haue beene at two and twenty murthers, and with his owne hand, had cut many mens throates. He dyed miserably, roaring like a Bull when they brake his bones. The Emperout CHARLES the fift beeing in <hi>Germanie,</hi> whereas af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres of warre kept him, hee was constrained to send one of the cheefe of his Court into <hi>Spaine,</hi> to haue a care of affaires and difficulties that should arise. This <hi>Viceroy,</hi> a young Prince, much giuen to hunting, was one day in the kingdome of <hi>Granado,</hi> and being in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sute of a wilde Beast, hee strayed so farre from his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as following his game through a great wood with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out respect of time or waye, hee found himselfe in a desolate place and be-nighted. By meanes whereof hee began to looke all about him, to see if hee could discouer some house or other place where hee might shrowde himselfe. Therevpon he sees a little Cottage, and riding thether, hee intreates the Peasant that dwelt there, to lodge him that night. The which the peasant
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:3511:58"/>
granted, and receiued him into his Cottage, where at that time there were sixe personnes, that is, the Peasant, his Wife, his Sunne of twenty yeares of age, his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in Lawe, newely married, a seruant which kept his Cattell, a rough fellowe and of an ill aspect, and then a little Daughter. The Prince beeing lighted from his horse recommends him vnto this vallet, and then he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into the Peasants house and drawes neere the fire, whilest they make ready supper, not dreaming of any harme. These people not knowing the Prince, nor he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couering himselfe to any; they seeing him so richly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareled, and of a goodly presence they held him to bee some great rich-man, and thinking it not fit to let go so fat a preye, they beganne to deuise some meanes to kill him, and to get his spoyles. After supper they prepare him a bedde in a certaine Chamber, which had but a weake doore, easie to force. In going vp and downe, the Daughter in Lawe newly married (who had an Inckling of this cruell plot) taking pittie of this young Prince, whome shee did see of so goodly a stature, and of an honourable port and carriage, called him aside: hauing drawne him a part and intreated him to keepe secret what shee should tell him, shee discouers the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise breefely vnto him, whilest the Father, Sonne and vallet were complotting againe a newe in the stable. The Prince mooued at this report, and inclyning to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue some thing was readie to discouer what hee was. But doubting presently that it would but hazard his life, in committing it to the fayth of such barbarous people, which did so wickedly violate all the rights of huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie and hospitality, to conspire against any man, whome they did see in so braue equipage, well mounted,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:3511:58"/>
and courteously receiued by them: hee chose rather (vnder GOD) to trust vnto his owne valour, then vnto the worde of men that had no faith, and whose hearts were couered with dissimulation and bloud. Hee suffers himselfe then to bee conducted by the Peasant into this little chamber, and hauing shut the doore vnto him hee drewe a great heauy Chestvnto it, to serue as a Barrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe, and then hee held his rapier ready, and by him was a long pistoll bended and primde, watching and attending what would become of the report of the Daughter in Lawe: Presently the Peasant (who thought he had beene a sleepe by reason of his trauell of hunting) came softly to the doore, thinking to enter it without any difficultie. But being frustrate of his expectation, he beganne to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate his guest to open him the doore, for that he would take a couering for a bed out of the Cofer, of the which hee had great neede. The Prince (who slept not) an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered. <hi>Retyre importunate man, I am nowe at rest, and will not open the dore at this time.</hi> Then the Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant beganne to exclaime, crie out and say, that hee was vndone and that there was one would braue him in his owne house wherevpon hee falls to his armes, and threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens to breake all, yea to kill him that was in that little chamber if he did not presently open, and yeeld vnto his mercy. The Peasant &amp; his man co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to breake downe the doore, the Sonne sought to enter the Chamber by a windowe, and all togither made a marueilous attempt. The Prince seeing himself reduced to extremity, dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth his pistoll at the doore, peerceth it easily, and kills the Peasant, then drawing backe the Chest, hee issues forth with his rapier in hand, dispatcheth the Sonne, and runnes after the seruant, who saues himselfe by

flight. But all was not yet done, for the cryes of the hostesse, and the extraordynarie noyse that shee made, did awake the other neighbour shepards, who came run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with their Armes, enuironed the house, and cried out murther. The Prince standing vpon his gard, had patience vntill it was day, and seeing this troupe of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiners to encrease, he beganne to let them as then vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand what hee was, threatning to cause them all to bee hanged, if they did refuse to assist him and to conduct him. If they would not beleeue him, they should fetch the Magistrate of the next place: and if they did not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of that condition, their ruine and confusion was at hand. Being mooued with the speech and presence of a personage so farre different from their condition, they beganne to growe some-what milde: yet in such sort as they lay hold of him, binde him, and are leading him to the Gouernor of a Towne, which was some leagues fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> rhence. The Princes gardes arryuing in the meane time, seeing him in this equipage were readie to cut all this troupe of Peasants in peeces: but the Prince did expresly forbid them. All the former being discouered and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, the Peasants confederates were punished accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their merits, the seruant was broken vpon the wheele, the theeues house burnt, and the Daughter in Lawe was richely recompenced for her faith-full aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement.</p>

A certaine man named IOHN GVY, Sonne to EME GVY a Capper in the towe of <hi>Chastillon</hi> vpon <hi>Lion,</hi> had bin very disordred all his life, caused for the most part by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence of his parents. It happened one Sater day in September 1565. that the Sonne was debauched accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this custome, and returned home very late, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at the Father was much displeased, saying, that seeing he continued this wicked course, he should be in the end constrayned to chase him out of his companie. To whome the Sonne (beeing full of pride,) answered pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somptuously, that he was ready to depart, euen prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, so as they would giue him his clothes: vpon this dispute the Father went to bed, beeing forced to threaten his Sonne, if he would not be silent. In the ende, seeing that hee preuailed not, and not able any longer to beare the proude replies of his Sonne, hee rise out of his bedde in chollor to punnish his vndutifullnesse: who seeing his Father approche in choller to beate him, hee sodenly layed his hand vpon his sword, and rebelling against his Father, thrust him through the Bodie. wherevpon hee fell sodenly to the ground, crying out with a loude voice that hee was dead. The neighbours amazed at this crie, came in presently, and soone after the Iustice: who found the olde man layed all along readie to giue

The bloudie sword was also found by his Sonne, who warmed himselfe, to whome the Father (mooued with compassion, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting the crueltie hee had vsed against him,) had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten saied. Sonne saue thy selfe. I pardon thee my death: the Mother had also giuen him the like councell to escape: but GOD by his power did so staie him, as hee had no power to flie. Beeing carried to prison and examined, at the first hee couered his parricyde, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusing his Father that hee had slaine himselfe. But his excuses beeing found friuolous, hee was condemned to haue his right hand cut off, then to bee pinched with hot pincers, and in the ende hanged by the feete vpon a gibet, and strangled with a stone of sixe score pound which should bee hanged at his necke.

The most fearfull of all the Comets in our time, was that in the yeare 1527<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the sight of it strooke such a terror into many, as some died, others fell sick. It was seene of many thousands of people, seeming very long and of a bloudy colour. On the top therof was seene the representation of a crooked arme holding a great sword in his hand, as if he would strike. At the point of this sword were three starres<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that which toucht the point directly, was more cleere and shining then the rest. On either side of the beames of this Comet were seene many battle-axes, daggers, bloudy swords, among the which they did marke a great number of mens heads cut off, hauing their beards &amp; haire horribly curled.

and Cardinall) being at that time Gouernor of <hi>Lion,</hi> there were then in <hi>Lion,</hi> two Bretheren called BOVRGATS, Gold-smiths by their professions, but very much disordered. As the liberty of those times did giue meanes to many to glutte their passions vpon them whome they did mallice: the BOVRGATS laide hands vpon a companion of theirs a Dyer, vpon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text that hee was of a contrarye religion: but it was to reuenge them-selues for a quarrell which they had formerly against him, and not ended to their liking. They take him and lead him to their dwelling house, towardes the Abbey of <hi>Esnay,</hi> beeing out of the way, farre from resort of people. They binde him fast hand and foote<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and then tye him by the neck vnto the Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, so as hee did hang vpright, not being able to sitte nor leane any way. They leaue him in this sort a whole day, threatning him with present death. At night they bring in men of their owne sorte and liuing to Supper, to bee spectators of this Tragedie: they are merry and make good cheere, and after Supper they spend the time, some in playing at Cardes, others in pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, pricking, and burning the nose of this poore pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner, being bond hand and foote, and tyed in the corner of the Chimney. This continued vntill eleuen of the clocke at night, when their companions went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way and retyred. As for the BOVRGATS, with-out proceeding any further, they cast themselues clothed, with their Swordes by their sides, vpon a Bedde, where they both fell presently a sleepe.

Being thus loose, hee was mightily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed what hee should doe. For if these people did awake, hee was but a dead man, hauing no meanes to defend himselfe, they being armed, and hee disa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

If he had had a Table cloath, a Sheete or a Couering, hee might haue slipt downe by the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe: but in opening it, the noyse might awake them, so as they might followe him and ouer take him, the wayes beeing strongly and very straightly garded: In this greeuous perplexitie, hee discouers, that the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quay (who slept in the other corner of the Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney) had a Dagger at his Girdle. Hee therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solues to kill those two brothers his enemies with this Dagger.</p>
            <p>But there was some difficultie and hazard in the taking of it, for that the Laquaye awaking would giue the Alarum, yet by the light of the fire, hee comes softely vnto him, and drawes out his Dagger, so quickly, and in such sorte as the Laquay stirred not. Hauing it, hee sodenly went vp into the Chamber, and leaped vpon the BOVRGATS, and stabbes eyther of them in the brest with this Dagger. As hee would haue doubled his stroake, one of them leapes vp and layes hold of an Halbard which stood hard by, he runs after the Dyer, who flyes downe the staires apace to
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:3511:80"/>
saue himselfe, at the foote whereof this BOVRGAT fell, and presently dyed. The Dyer mounts againe, and findes the other dead in the Chamber. Hee begins to threaten the Laquaye to kill him presently, if he made any noise: hee tooke a Candle, lead the Laquey into the Seller, and forceth him to eate, and to drinke a Glasse of Wine, then hee bindes him surely, dooing him no other harme, barres the Sellar doore, comes vp and takes that which was easiest to bee transported, out of his enemies Chamber. And at the breake of daye, the Gardes beeing raysed, hee leaues the house lockt, and so gettes out at Saint SEBASTIANS gate, without any hinderance or staye, the which was to bee admired, seeing they suffered none to goe out but with a Pasporte. The friends and companions of BOVRGATS, seeing them neyther in the morning nor after Dinner, grewe into some doubt, and after no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice giuen to the Captaine of the Quarter, vnder whome these BOVRGATS had charge and command, with his consent, they brake open the doore, and then drewe forth the Laquay, who cryed for helpe in the Sellar, and found the rest as wee haue sayde. The Dyer liued some time after, and reported this Historie to many, and dyed else-where. <hi>Memoires of Lion.</hi>

But the Preacher distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered with his censure, deuised in his thoughts, a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, a Scaffold, and death, for GRINEVS: who dining with many worthy men, reported vnto them, what speeches hee had had with this Preacher. Therevpon one calls for Doctor PHILIP, beeing set at the Table neere vnto GRINEVS, who goes out of the <hi>Stoue,</hi> and findes a graue olde man, of a louely countenance, well apparelled, and vnknowne, who with a graue and

Hauing fitted himselfe with pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of wood, and a scaffold in the Well, he goes downe lower with a Ladder, to take vp a Hammer which hee had left among the stones.

All runne thether, and hold the man to bee smothered, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that they must fill vp the Well, and that should be his graue. The Iustice resolued, that they should pull out all this rubbish, and ordaines, that the Masons body should be buried among other Christians in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Church-yard. According to this decree, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to worke the 11. of the same moneth. About two of the clocke after noone, the worke-men labour to drawe out a great stone, and finding that it was hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low vnderneth, they put downe a long pole to sound the depth. They pricke the poore Mason on the

nose with the end of this pole, who beganne to crie and to intreate them to drawe him out. The workemen hearing this confused sound labour with more cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage then before, and about ten of the clocke at night they espie him standing right vp behinde the Ladder, beeing vp to the knees in the myer.

Not long after, seeming to be some-what better, she walked abroad, and carryed along with her a Son of hers, that is now of very great hope, but was then some 4. or 5. yeares old, with full entent to drowne him and her selfe in a riuer that was thereby: vnto the bridge where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of she made many iournies, being still entertained with the Childes comfortable prattle. Returning home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, within a while after shee was easily recouered, namely, by letting of bloud in the <hi>Saphena,</hi> and taking of a gentle purgation.

Being in the Wel (&amp; som-what that was very heauy lying on her head and laboring to make her let go the rope, for to plunge her ouer head and eares in the water &amp; so drowne her,) this same personage came vnto her, tooke her by the arme, &amp; holpe her to get vp againe, which she could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer haue done of her selfe. He also comforted her in the garden, and led her very gently to her Chamber, where hee vanished away. In like manner hee met her as shee was going towardes the bridge: and followed her a loofe of vntill such time as she returned home.

of her head, without any precedent or ensuing paine. Wherevpon she went vnto her husband being in bed, &amp; shewing him the tooth sayd vnto him, husband the Lord calls me: and it is the accomplishment of my desires. O what an happy creature am I! Her husband some what mooued there with, endeuored notwithstanding to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort her, and falling of purpose into other talke, arose, &amp; went and prayed. After that, this honorable dame she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed her selfe alwaies merier to her husband and friends then before, being graue and seuere to her children, and was fairer and lustier then euer she had bin in seauentene yeares that she had liued a wife. Towards the end of the moneth, there being no apparance of any such matter, as she was going to rise betimes in the morning, according to her custome, for to looke to a young child she had, and to tend the affaires of her house, shee was constrained to keepe her bed. Wherevpon her husband comming in, she put him in minde of her tooth and the speeches shee had vsed to him about it, and therefore exhorted him to submit himselfe vnto the will of GOD. He being gon vp for to commend his deare moitie vnto him that neuer reiecteth the praiers of his seruants, she tooke al her iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ells and putting them vp in her purse sent them by her el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest Daughter to him, and desired him to keepe them for her sake. Hee came downe, and gently rebuked her for this apprehension. Oh husband, sayd shee, I haue no neede of any thing in this world, for I am going to my GOD. O how blessed am I! during her sicknesse, which lasted twenty daies, I was for the most part present with her, beeing tied there vnto for diuers reasons. Shee put mee in remembrance againe of that I haue declared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and from so many excellent deliuerances drewe an

The day of her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cease approching, she began to smile, and being deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the cause thereof by mee; shee answered softly in mine eare, I see my man. O how beautifull he is! then crying out shee said; Stay for mee, stay for me. All the while she was sick, she made no account neither of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, kinsfolkes, friends, nor of any other thing in the world. And when her husband many times brought their children vnto her, she sayd nothing, but, <hi>God blesse you, God be your Father and Mother<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and to the yongest of them; <hi>Hah, little Souldiar!</hi> She neuer commended them but once vnto her husband. And after that, shee beheld them with a regardlesse eye. A quarter of an houre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her departure, she called for her Petti-coate to rise, and as she was about to go out of her bed, she desired to be made vnready, and being laid downe againe, she sent for her husband and vsed these words vnto him. <hi>Behold the end of my desire, and the beginning of my felicitie.</hi> IESVS CHRIST <hi>is my hope: Good husband, I desire but one thing of you. Pray vnto GOD for me.</hi> Her husband and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren being prostrated on their knees, after an earnest praier vnto GOD, she closed her eyes as if she had been going to sleepe, &amp; died with a sweeter countenance then euer she had had in al her life before. <hi>Extracted out of my Memorials.</hi>

At her feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full cryes, her belly swelled so big, that one would haue thought shee had beene gone 8. moneths with child: fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally she lost her breath, and not able to continue in a place, shetumbled from one side of the bed to the other, putting her head many times betweene her legges, as if she would haue plaid some tumbling trick. Then being questioned concerning that which had be falne her, she neuer remembred any such matter. But searching, saith he, the causes of this disease, we were of opinion that it proceeded from a suffocation of the Matrix, and from malignant vapours fuming vpward, to the detriment of the heart and braine. Whervpon we endeuoured to ease her with medicines, but that seruing to no purpose, she became more outragious then before, and at last began to vomit long crooked Yron nailes, tagges of points, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led within with waxe, and wound all about with hayres, and so great a portion of her breakfast, that it was not possible for any man whatsoeuer to swallowe it whole.

            <p>MEINOR CLATH, a Gentleman dwelling at <hi>Bouten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brouck,</hi> a Castle in the Duchie of <hi>Iuilliers,</hi> had a seruant named WILLIAM, who 14. yeares together was tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented of the Diuill. One day swelling mightily about the throate, and looking very pale, so that they were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid he would haue falne downe: IVDITH his Mistresse a very honest Gentlewoman, gathering her folkes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, began to call vpon GOD: where-vpon there sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly issued out of this WILLIAMS mouth, amongst other trash, all the fore-part of a Shepheards breeches, Flint-stones, some whole &amp; some broken, little bottoms of thred, a false head of haire, needles, a peece of a boyes silke doublet, and a Peacocks feather. Being demanded concerning the cause of his sicknesse, hee answered that he met with a woman hard by <hi>Camphuse,</hi> which blowed in his face from whence he thought it proceeded. But afterward when he was well, he confessed that this accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation was not true, and that he was induced by the diuill to say so. Furthermore, he added, that all those prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous things came not out of his body, but were throwne against his mouth by the Diuell whilst they saw him vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit. One day being more carefully looked vnto, by reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they were afraid he would haue done himselfe some mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, his eyes remained so fast closed together, that it was impossible to open the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. At length GERTRVDE, CLATHS eldest daughter, of some 12. yeares of age, comming vnto him, exhorted him to pray to GOD, that it would please him to restore his sight againe: wherevpon WILLIAM
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:3511:88"/>
desired her to pray, which she did, and her eies were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly opened, to the great amazement of all that were present. The Diuil often perswaded him not to giue eare eyther to his Mistresse or any other that troubled his head, with talking to him of GOD, who could not helpe him, seeing hee was once dead, as hee had heard it publickly preached. Another time striuing to put his hand vnder the Kitchin-maides clothes, and shee rating him for it by his name, hee answered in a big voice; My name is not WILLIAM but BEELZEEVB: wherevnto his Mistresse replied; Thinkest thou therefore that wee feare thee? He in whom wee trust, is of farre more infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite power and strength then thou art. Then CLATH in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited with a holy zeale in the presence of all his house, commanded Sathan, in the name of IESVS CHRIST, to come forth of him, reading the 11. Chapter of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Luke,</hi> where mention is made of a dumbe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill cast out by the power of our Sauiour, as also of BEEL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ZEBVB Prince of Diuils. In the end WILLIAM began to take some rest, and slept till morning, like a man in a traunce: then taking a little broth, and feeling himselfe through well, hee was carried home to his friends, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing first thanked his master and mistresse, and desired GOD to recompence them for the paines they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with him during his affliction.

            <p>Vpon the 18. day of March 1566. a very memorable matter happened in the towne of <hi>Amsterdam</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> whereof Maister ADRIAN NICHOLAS Chancellor of <hi>Gueldres,</hi> makes a publicke discourse, containing this which ensueth. Some two moneths agoe, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:3511:89"/>
(saith he) thirty children in this Towne began to bee tormented after a strange manner, as though they had beene lunatick or madde. By fitts they threw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues against the ground, and this torment lasted halfe an houre or an houre at the most. When they rose a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, they neuer remembred any paine they had felt, nor any other thing they had done in their fitte, but thought they had slept. The Phisitions to whom they had recourse, did them no good, because they were of opinion that their disease proceeded not from naturall causes. Wherevpon their Parents imagining they were bewitched, resorted vnto Witches: but they preuailed as little with all their sorcery. Finally they repaired vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Exorcists, by reason they were perswaded their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were possessed, because vpon the suddaine they said many things which surpast their capacitie and age. These Exorcists emploied all their cunning, and lost their labour. During their exorcismes, the children vomited a great sort of Needles, Pinnes, Thimbles, lumpes of Cloath, pieces of broken Pottes, Glasse, Haire, and other such things: for all which not-with-standing, they were neuer the better, but at times fell into the same ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie againe, to the great astonishment of all men for the rarenesse of so strange a spectacle.

            <p>The like happened at <hi>Rome,</hi> the yeare 1553. for in the Hospitall of the Orphans, about seuenty Girles were possessed in one night, and continued in that estate aboue two yeares. CARDAN, <hi>in the</hi> 4. <hi>Booke de varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, Chap.</hi> 176.</p>

this which followeth happened at <hi>Fungestall,</hi> a Village in the Bishoprick of <hi>Eysteten,</hi> verified by a number of good witnesses. VLRIC NEVSESSAR a labouring man dwelling in that Village, was miserably tormented with a paine in his hips. One day the Chirurgion hauing made an incision in the skinne, drew out a great Yron Nayle: the paine abated not for all that, but contrarily so encreased, that the poore man became desperate, and with a sharpe knife cut his owne throate. As hee was carrying forth to be buried, two Chirurgions in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of a great many people, opened his stomack, and there found some round pieces of wood, foure Steele Kniues, some very keene, and some dented like a Sawe, also two Yron barres of 9. inches long a peece: and a great lumpe of hayre. I wonder how that Yron could be contained within the capacity of his stomach: but no question, it was a deuise of the Diuill, who cunningly supposed all those things for to make himselfe be feared.

            <p>The torments where with the Diuill afflicted certaine Nunnes at <hi>Wertet</hi> in the County of <hi>Horne,</hi> are meruai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and horrible. Which came first (as it is reported) by the meanes of a poore woman, who in the Lent time borrowed a Quarte of Salte of the Nunnes, weyghing three pounds or there-about, and payde them twise asmuch againe, a little before Easter. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that they found little white Pellets in their Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, like to round Sugar Plummes, and Salte in taste, whereof not-with-standing none of them did eate, nor knew not from whence they came.

certaine of the Nunnes to come to one of their Sisters that was sick: but there was no such matter when they came. If at any time they chaunced to make water in their Chamber-pot, it was suddainely snatched away, so that they all berayed their beddes. They were often drawne about the house by the heeles, and so tickled in the soles of their feete, that they swouned with laughing. Some had pieces of their flesh plucked away, and others had their legges, armes and face turned back-ward. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of them beeing thus tormented, vomited a great quantity of black licor, like vnto incke, although they had eaten nothing in seauen weekes before, but a little i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

As certaine of their friends came to the Couent for to make merry with them who seemed to be almost well, on a suddaine some of them fell back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward as they sate at table, quite depriued of speach and sence: the rest lay all along as though they had bin dead, with their armes and legges bowed back-ward. One a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them was hoisted vp in the aire, and albeit those that were present stroue with all their might to hinder it, yet was shee snatched vp spight of their teethes, and then so throwne against the ground, that shee seemed to be dead: but rysing vp againe within a while after as if it had beene out of a sound sleepe, she went out of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectory hauing no hurt. Some went vpon their knees, as if they had no feete. Others climbed vp to the toppes of trees, and came downe againe as lightly, as if they had beene Catts.

Sometimes they were thrust out of their pues in the Church, or had their vailes pulled of their heads: and many times their throtes was so stopped, that they were not able to swallowe any meate. This strange calamitie endured the space of ten yeares in some of them. And it is reported that a young Nunne surprised with the loue of a young man was cause thereof: for her parents hauing denyed her him in mariage, the Diuell taking the forme of that young man vpon him appeered vnto her in her greatest flames, and counselled her to become a Nunne, as incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently shee did.

The Diuill tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hold on this occasion, began to torment them more then before, and which was worse, induced them to bite and beate one another, and to throw one another to the ground, which they did without any harme, and as easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie as if they had beene feathers, insomuch that they ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well perceiued their will was not in their owne pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. When they were kept from fighting and doing any other violence, then they tormented themselues in most grieuous maner, and assoone as they were let alone, they fell to biting of one another, and yet neuer felt any hurt. If ANNE spake in her fit, it seemed to be done by meanes of some other that drew her breath in and out. Shee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood her selfe speake: but the speech ended, she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred not a word of that shee had spoken, vnlesse it were repeated vnto her againe: for then she remembred that she had pronounced it. At any time when she set her selfe to pray, incontinently shee was molested by the euill spirit: fo that she could not, as willingly she would, either attentiuely prosecute her purpose, or moue her tongue. But if shee chanced, without thinking on it, to mutter a <hi>Pater noster,</hi> or an <hi>Aue Maria</hi> on her Beads, shee was so farre from being hindered, that then she felt ease. Otherwaies, shee was altogether dull, and destitute of sence, discretion and iudgement: so that she could neuer thinke a suisedly on any thing what-so euer. If any good deuo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:3511:92"/>
pleasure, and was eased by it. Nowe all these Nunnes thus tormented felt a paine, that got vp ward by little and little from the soles of their feete, which seemed to them to bee skalded with hot seething water. And though they were all thus strangely afflicted, yet lost they not their appetite, but still receiued sustenance. The Diuell spake very often and much by the mouthes of the yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest which had their spirits troubled; vnto whom he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented himselfe in the forme of a black Catte, and in the likenesse of <hi>Else Kamense,</hi> or of her Mother, or Brother: so as euery one thought, (but falsely) that those persones were the cause of such torments. ANNE being resolued to returne no more to the Couent, from whence her pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents had taken her, but to serue GOD deuoutly, so as (with as more setled iudgement), this calamity left her: notwithstanding if she receiued but letters from the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, shee felt a shwering through-out all her Body, as if shee should presently haue fallen againe into her former inconuenience. Not long after she maried, and was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer troubled with that calamity more. She told me al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so that ELSE KAMENSE was afflicted in the same manner as the rest were, namely with the falling sicknesse, &amp; that many times she talked idely too wherevpon the Nunnes were perswaded that shee had bewitched her selfe, to the end she might not be suspected of that she had done, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch that they all set vpon this maide, whom the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning man had told them was a witch. The poore wench beeing carryed before the Iustice, at the first confessed that shee was cause of that heauy spectacle, wrought by meanes of the mixture of certaine poysons: being at the place of execution, and ready to die, she protested that shee had neuer vsed any poyson, but onely at times
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:3511:93"/>
pronounced certaine curses.</p>
            <p>After that <hi>Else</hi> and her mother were burned, some of the inhabitants of <hi>Hammone,</hi> a towne there by, began to bee tormented of the euill spirit. The minister of the place got foure or fiue of them into his house, for to instruct and fortifie them against the impostures of the enemy. But when hee had recited some articles of a Christans beliefe, they beganne to mocke the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister, and to name certaine women of the Towne, to whome they sayd they would go, mounted vpon Bucks, which should carry them thither. Incontinently one of them got him a stride vpon a forme, crying out that hee was ryding away. Another stepping vp behinde him, fell back-ward quite ouer and ouer, and lighted against the Chamber dore, which flying open, hee tumbled from the toppe of the stayres downe to the bottome, and had no hurt. About the same time, in a village named <hi>Houel,</hi> hard by the same Towne, diuers men were cruelly tormented of the euil spirit. I. WIER <hi>in booke</hi> 4. <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.</p>
            <p>The Nunnes of the Couent of <hi>Nazareth</hi> at <hi>Cologne</hi> were tormented almost like those of <hi>Kantorp.</hi> Hauing beene a long time diuersly vexed by the Diuell, much more in the yeare 1564. For they were layd along vpon the ground as if it had beene to haue had the company of man: during which indignity their eies remained closed, which afterwards they opened very shame fastly, &amp; as if they had endured some grieuous paine. A young wench named GERTRVDE, of 14. yeares of age, gaue way to all this mischiefe. She had beene often abused with those wanto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> apparitions in her bed, wherof her laughter made proofe, although she had tried diuers meanes to remedy
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:3511:93"/>
it, but all in vaine. For as a fellowe of hers lay on a pallet by her, only for to keepe her from such apparitions, the poore wench grewe affraied hearing the noise that was made in <hi>Gertrudes</hi> bedde, of whome at length the Diuell tooke possession, and beganne to afflict her with sundry sorts of Convulsions. In her fit, she was like a blind body, vttering strange and inconstant speeches tending to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire. The like did diuers others: and so this plague pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed by little &amp; little, &amp; augmented much more, when these poore afflicted soules began to haue recourse vnto vnlawfull remedies. Now whilest the Diuell tormented them thus, some of them were taken with the plague, and as long as they had it, the euil spirit neuer troubles them, through a singular goodnesse of GOD, who lymiteth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Satan certaine bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, which he cannot passe (witnesse IOB) in afflicting those who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> GOD hath deliuered vp vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him for a time in this world. The beginning of all this calamity proceeded from certaine lewd youthes, who hauing gotten acquaintance, by playing at stoole-ball thereby with one two of those Nunnes, climbed ouer the walles, &amp; enioyed their loues. But afterwards leauing of that course, by reason they were depriued of the meanes to continewe it, the Diuell corrupted the phantasie of those miserable creatures, and entreated them as hath beene declared. I. WIER <hi>booke</hi> 1. <hi>Chap.</hi> 12.</p>
            <p>To these may be added another Nunne of the Couent of <hi>Bosledue,</hi> hard by Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> Church, named IVDITH, whom I haue seene tormented of the Diuill with strange convulsions for hee so stopt her throate that shee could not swallowe any meate, and many times held her toung in such sorte, that hee kept her from speaking: likewise I haue heard her vtter ridiculous and horrible speaches.
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:3511:94"/>
With her I will ioyne another maide seruant to a Nunne of a great and noble house. A Country fellowe had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised her marriage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but hee fell in loue with another: whereat she was so grieued, that being gone some halfe a mile from the Couent, she met the Diuell in the likenes of a proper yong man, who began to talke very familiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with her, discouering vnto her all the Country fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes secrets, with the speech hee had vsed to his newe loue: and that to the end he might haue made the wench fall into dispaire, and so drawne her to haue made her self away. Being come to a little brooke, he tooke the bottle of oile, which she carried, that she might the better passe ouer the bridge: and enticed her to go with him to a place that hee named, which shee refused, saying what would you haue me do going along those mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes? Wherevpon he vanished away, which so affrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the poore maide that she fell into a swound: her Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres being aduertised of it, sent a litter to fetch her to the Couent. Where she lay a long time sick, and as it were depriued of sense being troubled in spirit after a strange manner, and diuers times complayned that she was mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serably tormented of the Diuell, who would haue her &amp; carry her away through the windowe. Afterward she was married to that Country-fellowe, and recouered her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer health: <hi>The same.</hi>

            <p>At <hi>Leuensteet,</hi> a village belonging to the Duke of <hi>Bruns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi> there was a maide named MARGARET ACHILS about twenty yeares old, dwelling with her Sisters. Vpon the second day of Iune, going to make cleane a paire of showes, she tooke one of her kniues, that was some halfe a foote long: and as shee was beginning to scrape them being set in a corner of the Chamber, and very weake
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:3511:94"/>
with an ague, that had held her a long time, suddenly an old woman came in, who asked her whether she had her ague still, and how she felt her-selfe in her sicknesse; and so without any farther talke departed. After the shooes were made cleane, this maide let the Knife fall into her lap, which she could not finde againe, although she had sought very diligently for it: whereat she was some-what afraide, but farre more, when she perceiued a black Dog lying vnder the Table, whom she droue away, hoping to finde her Knife. The Dog being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> began to shew his teeth, and grinning at her, got into the street and ran away. Presently wherevpon this maide thought she felt I know not what, running downe on the one side of her back, as it were some cold humor, and immediatly shee swounded, continuing so till the third day after, when she began to find a little ease, &amp; to receiue some sustenance. Now being demanded co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the cause of her griefe, she answered, that she was well assured the Knife which fell into her lappe was entred into her left side, in which place she felt a paine. And although her friends contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted her, because they attributed this indisposition to a melancholy humor, and that she talked idlely by reason of her sicknesse, long abstinence, and other accidents: yet ceased shee not to persist in her continuall plaints and teares, so that her head became very light, &amp; some-times shee remained two dayes togither without taking any thing, although they vsed both faire meanes &amp; foule to draw her therevnto. Her fits were worse at some-times then at other some, insomuch that shee tooke but little rest, because of the continuall paines that tormented her: whereby shee was constrained to go euen double on a staffe. And that which more augmented her griefe and
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:3511:95"/>
diminished her ease, was that shee verily beleeued the knife was in her body, and yet euery one obstinatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted her in it, and propounded the impossibilitie therof, imagining that her braine was distempred, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering nothing was seene that might induce the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to such an opinion, saue her incessant teares and complaints, wherin she continued the space of certaine moneths, &amp; to such time as there appeared on her left side a tumor of the bignes of an Egge, like to an halfe Moone, which encreased or decreased according as the swelling waxed more or lesse. Then the poore wench began to say: You would not beleeue the knife was in my body till now: but ere long you shall see how it is fixed in my side. And indeed on the thirtith day of Iune, namely about thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene moneths after, she had first suffered this affliction, there issued such an abundance of matter out of the vlcer which was growne on that side, that the swelling began to asswage, &amp; then the point of the knife appered, which the maid would haue pulled out, had she not bin staid by her friends, who sent for Duke HENRIES Chirurgian, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at that time resident in the Castle of <hi>Wolffbutel.</hi> The Chirurgian comming thither on the 4. day of Iuly, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Minister, to comfort, instruct, and incourage the maide, as also to obserue her answers, because euery one thought she was possessed. She consented to be ruled by the Chirurgia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, although she was perswaded that present death would ensue. The Chirurgian perceiuing the point of the knife which appeared in her left side, with his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments drew it forth: and it was found in all respects like to the other that was in her sheath, and very much vsed about the middest of the blade. Afterwards the vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer was healed by the Chirurgian. <hi>In the same booke, ch.</hi> 14.</p>

            <p>But yet farther to shew the sleights and subtilties of Sathan, who with efficacie of error turmoiles such as the diuine iustice deliuers vp vnto him, I will adde another history touching a child <hi>Demoniack,</hi> written by D.

               </gap>VS a Doctor of <hi>Lovaine</hi> the 3. day of March 1574. as followeth. A child of our towne foretels, that the wicked &amp; tyrranicall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plot of the rebels of the Low-countries shal now take an end. We feare notwithstanding least it be some deuise of the euill spirit: albeit no man can discouer any such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter yet. This child cries out &amp; bids euery one pray hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and incessantly vnto GOD: he himselfe with hands heaued vp, prayes 3. times a day. Hee hath foretold mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueilous things of our time, &amp; all that he hath foretold is come to passe, not failing in any circumstance. Also hee saith, that the Angell GABRYEL hath reuealed vnto him, how all these Tragedies of <hi>Flanders</hi> shall end, before next Summer be halfe past: and how the King of <hi>Spaine</hi>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:3511:96"/>
shall come into the low-countries, &amp; appease all by most happy meanes. He hath likewise foretold the very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of time of the taking of <hi>Middelborough,</hi> and infinite other things come to passe according to his predictions. I (most vnworthy) was also called to examine this child, and was wonderfully amazed to see so simple a thing, which can neither write nor read, answer so readily to all demands, and resolue the greatest difficulties could bee propounded. And because Sathan transfigures himselfe into an Angell of light, I obiected many and sundry que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions vnto him: but so farre is it from an Angell that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hors the crosse of our Lord, or the name of IESVS: that contrariwise it hath taught the child a praier, in substance containing these words: O IESVS <hi>of Nazareth, which was crucified for vs, haue mercy vpon vs: helpe vs poore sinners that we may returne againe vnto the faith.</hi> I. WIER, <hi>in</hi> 1. <hi>Booke, chap.</hi> 10. where he addeth this censure. The contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry euent hath manifested, that this child was possessed of the diuill, who spake and prognosticated by his mouth. For the troubles of <hi>Flanders</hi> ended not the Summer fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, nor three yeares (we may say, nor fiue and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie yeares) after, neither was, nor is there any newes of the K<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Therefore one may perceiue who that GABRIEL was, that could declare the very moment of time, of the taking of <hi>Middelborough</hi> in <hi>Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> to wit, the Diuill, who being a spirit, transports himselfe in an instant from one place to another, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of his incomprehensible swiftnesse. Hee it was that moued this childe to the prayers before mentioned, the better to colour his impostures and lyes. For so hee hath
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:3511:96"/>
accustomed to mingle truth with falsehood. As Doctor COLEN may acknowledge, if he be still aliue, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this new age 1600. If hee be departed this world, I leaue the decision thereof to his companions.</p>
            <p>The yeare 1594. in the Marquisate of <hi>Brandebourg,</hi> there were seene aboue eight score persons together Demoniacks, which vttered meruailous things, and both knew and named such as they had neuer seene<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> amongst those persons they noted some which were dead long before, that walked crying out vnto euery one to repent, to leaue off all dissolutenesse in apparell, &amp;c. and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced GODS iudgments, affirming that they were commanded by the Lord to preach amendment of life, whereby sinners might bee brought againe to the right way. These Demoniacks raged exceedingly where-so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer they came, and belched forth infinite out-rages against the Ministers of the Church, talking of nothing but of apparitions of good and euill Angels. The Diuill shewed himselfe in diuers shapes, and in the Sermon time flew ouer the Church with a terrible noyse and crie: strawing points and peeces of gold and siluer all along as hee went.

<pb n="188" facs="tcp:3511:100"/>
SPIERA, who hauing said and done diuers things against his conscience, to maintaine himselfe and his charge, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing returned to his house, he could neuer rest an houre, no not a minute, nor feele any ease of his continuall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish. And euen from that night he was so terrified and had such horror of his actions, as hee held himselfe for lost. For (as he himselfe did afterwards confesse) he did see plainly before his eies, all the torments, all the paines of hell, and of the damned, and in his soule did heare the fearefull sentences being drawne before the iudgement seate of IESVS CHRIST. The next day and so fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, it was impossible to see him resume any cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage: but his spirits were strangely troubled, and the terror tooke from him all rest and appetite. This Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent was so grieuous to his friends and familiars, as some repented them much, that they had beene the cause of so great an inconuenient by their prayers and intreaties. Others, thinking it did proceed from some cholerick or melancholy humor (the effects whereof are often-times strange in those braines which are violently toucht) were of opinion to send him to <hi>Padoua,</hi> to be Physicked by the learned Physitions, reuiued by honourable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie, and setled by the conference of learned men that were there, to some of the which he was well knowne. His wife and children, with some of his familiar friends did accompany him, and hee was lodged in one of the chiefe houses. FRISIMILEGA, BELLOCAT and CRAS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SVS (famous and excellent Physitions) did visit him, and giue him Physicke with a singular affection: and found soone that he was little sicke in body, but grieuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in minde: for in all other things he discoursed graue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and constantly, so as none of his familiar friends could

decerne that the quickenesse of his discourse and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son was any thing impaired or weakened, continnuing still in this continuall anguish, manie were much troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and daylie his Chamber was full of people; some curious to see and to heare; others (but very fewe) were desirous to drawe him to hope in the mercies of GOD. I was present at many of his speeches, with some men of honour and learning. To deliuer that which I could obserue. I beganne first to note his age and his fashion. He was about fifty yeares old, free from the violent pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of youth, and from the coldnesse of old age. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing came out of his mouth that was lighly or foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly spoken, or that might discouer any doting in him; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though hee did day lie discours of graue and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant matters with the learned, and that some did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound vnto him high questions, especially in di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>inity. I will briefely relate some speeches they had with him, during his aboad at <hi>Padoua,</hi> and I will not forget that hee declared with a setled Iudgement, that hee did see the eternall vengeance of GOD prepared against the sinne which hee had committed. For that he did finde in him selfe, that those things which GOD had giuen to others, to reioyce their spirits and to liue well and happely, had all conspired against him in despight of his horrible for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet. For although (said hee) that GOD for a great blessing had promised to many holie men, a goodly issue and a great number of Children, in whose loue and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience they may repose their age, and that there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more pleasing in this present life, yet in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest of his miseries, the hands and faces of his Children were as horrible vnto him as the hang-mans. It cannot well be exprest, what greefe and vexation hee seemed to
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:3511:101"/>
receiue, when his Children brought him meate, forcing him to eate, and threatning him when hee refused it. Hee confessed his Children did their duties, &amp; yet he tooke al in ill part (saying) that he did not acknowledge GOD a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more for his Father, but did feare him as an aduersary, armed with iudgement. For he had bin three weekes in this apprehension, when hee spake these things, without eating or drinking, but what they forced him vnto, the which he receiued with great difficulty, the which hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted withall his power, spitting out that which they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him to take. Some of the Assistants were of opinion to make him a fraied, to make him the more apt, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue foode, first for the Soule, then for the bodie: asking him if hee did not feare greater and sharper torments after this life, then those heethen felt? Hee confessed that hee did expect farre more sharpe, and had alreadie horror of them: yet hee desired nothing more then to bee cast head-long into them, that hee might not feare other more greeuious torments. They asked him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, if hee thought his sinne to bee so fowle, as it could not bee pardoned through the bountie and infinite mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of GOD? His answere was, that hee sayd sinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Holie Ghost, which was so great a sinne, as it is called a sinne vnto death, that is to say, subiect to the eternall vengeance of GOD, and to the paines of hell. Whereof this poore wretch discoursed amplie, learned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and to subtilie against himselfe. Learned and Godly men, which did assist him, omitted no testymonies that might assure a wounded conscience, that GOD is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull, gentle and readie to pardon. But all this could not diuert him from his opinion, neither could they drawe any other thing from him, but that hee desired
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:3511:101"/>
much that hee might returne to some hope of pardon. But it fares with mee (sayth hee) as with Cryminall persons, shut vp in close prisons and fettered hand and foote. Sometimes they are saluted by their friends pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing by, who aduise them to breake prison and to deceiue their gards if they can. Such prisoners would gladly followe their counsell, but it is a vaine desire. Euen so is mine saied hee. As for the scriptures which were cited vnto him, touching the loue and affection of GOD the Father by reason of his Sonne IESVS CHRIST, hee did aduowe them, adding, that they did belong onelie to them whome IESVS CHRIST did repute his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theren and his members: but as for him hee had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced that loue, and willingly reiected all Brotherly allyance: neither was hee ignorant in howe great tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity of minde they might bee, who had once im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the promises of saluation, and did rest them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues continually therein. For confirmation whereof this his sad desaster (sayd hee,) was propounded for an example before all mens eyes: that if they were wise they should not hold it light, nor happened by any chance: but to learne by his ruine, howe dangerous it is to fall anie thing from that which beelongs to the great glorie of the Sonne of GOD. Adding that it was a slipperie and a very dangerous passage, yea most fearefull to him that stood not carefully vpon his gard: Moreouer forasmuch as such euident examples of the vengeance of almightie GOD, did seldome appeere to the eyes of men, they deserued to bee the more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie regarded. That amongest a great multitude and number of reprobates in the worlde, his calamitie was not singular; but his onely punnishment and ruyne
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:3511:102"/>
did satisfie GOD, a iust Iudge to admonish all others to haue a care of themselues. He added with all, that therein hee did acknowledge the seuerity of GODS iudgement, who had chosen him to make him a specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle rather then any other: and to admonish all by one mans mouth, to abstaine from all impietie: confessing moreouer that there was no reproch nor punnishment which hee had not deserued, by reason of his fowle offence. After that hee had discoursed sincerely and grauely of the diuine Iustice; hee sayd that they should not take it strange this his long speech touching the true reason of the will of GOD: for that oftentimes GOD doth wrest out of the mouth of reprobates most assured testymonies of his Maiestie, his Iustice, and his fearefull vengance: as wee see in IVDAS confessing his owne sinne and iustefying his Master. Vsing a long discours vpon this sentence, and desirous to shewe the greatnesse of GODS Iudgements: there are some (sayd hee,) who haue all things so wishfully, as they liue in all delights, without feare or apprehension of any harme, as hauing attained the higth of all felycitie: who notwithstanding are registred for perdition, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of IESVS CHRIST propounds an example in the rich man, enioying all the pleasures of the world with a full gorge, beeing after his death tormented in hell: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of mention is made in the sixteenth Chapter of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell after Saint <hi>Luke.</hi> That GOD doth often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound vnto makinde a hope of reward to drawe him to the right beleefe of His holy will; and oftimes hee doth withdrawe them from their Impieties by prodigious and fearefull signes. And yet as Impietie is naturall to Men, they make not their profit of such instructions,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:3511:102"/>
and thinke not that it concernes them: but contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise impute it to any other thing, rather then to the wisedome of GOD, to feare and reuerence him. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon he made a bitter inuectiue against a certaine Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher, whom hee had knowne aboue twenty yeares before, for that this MOROSOPHE had beene so impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, to deliuer in his lessons, yea to write it, and to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish it in Print, that all the miracles that IESVS CHRIST had done vpon the earth, might well be done by a man, that were skilfull in the knowledge of Naturall things. It were hard to represent the admiration where-with they were surprised, and with what compassion they were moued that came to visit him, for the discourses which they heard from his mouth. Euery man laboured earnestly to reduce this poore man to some hope of his saluation. Among others, there was one, a reuerend man for his holynesse of life, who departed not from the patients bed: It was the Bishop of <hi>Capo d' Istria,</hi> in the <hi>Venetians</hi> territories. Hee ceased not to exhorte SPIERA, and laboured by many testimonies of the holy Scriptures to diuert him from that apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: beseeching him by their friendship, by his loue to his Wife and Children, and for that his health should bee precious vnto him, that hee should haue a care of himselfe, and print in his heart a hope and trust of saluation by IESVS CHRIST. Adding that hee did not thinke that his spirit was altogether voide and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute, of some good and heauenly inspiration, seeing hee spake so holylye and deuoutly of the excellencie of Christian religion.</p>
            <p>Although the sicke man knew well that these admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions proceeded from a sincere and true heart: yet for
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:3511:103"/>
that hee had diuerse times reiected them, hee began to frowne, saying vnto the Bishop. You beleeue as I thinke, that I doe willingly nourish this obstinacie in my minde, and that I take delight in this vehement passion of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire. If you bee of that opinion, you are deceiued. I will tell you (to the ende you may knowe my resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) that if I could bee perswaded that the iudgement of GOD might by any meanes bee changed or miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated for mee, it should not greeue me to bee tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ten thousand yeares with the sharpest paines of Hell, so as I might haue any hope of rest after this long suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. But euen in that whereby you doe exhorte me to gather some hope: I see all meanes of health, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don taken from mee. For if the testimonies of holye Scripture haue any authoritie (as they haue) doe you thinke that IESVS CHRIST hath sayd in vaine. That he which hath renounced him before men, hee will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce him before his heauenly Father? doe you not see that it concernes mee, and that it is as it were parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly verified in my person? what shall become of him whom the Sonne hath disauowed before his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? when as you say that wee must hope for no salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but in IESVS CHRIST. Therevpon hee did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound certaine passages of the Epistle to the Hebrews, and of the second Catholike Epistle of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> out of the which hee drewe terrible conclusions against himselfe.</p>
            <p>Wee cannot beleeue with what grauitie and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie his wordes were deliuered, neyther was there euer man heard pleading better for himselfe, then SPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ERA did then against himselfe. Hee did alledge nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things of GODS Iustice, detesting his fore-passed
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:3511:103"/>
life: admonishing all that were about him very earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie: not to thinke that a Christians life was a light thing, and easily discharged. That it doth not consist onely in hauing the head Baptized, in reading certaine verses and Texts of the Gospell, and to bee termed an honest man: but it was needfull he should liue as the doctrine of trueth doth command him. Therevpon hee repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a Text out of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> exhorting vs to shewe through holynesse of life, certaine signes of the loue of GOD towards vs, and of the confidence wee should haue in him. Hee sayde moreouer, that hee had knowne many, who after they had tasted the sweetnesse of true felicitie, they suffered them-selues to bee so carryed away, as they had no longer care to performe that which belonged to a Childe of GOD. Hee protested that hee had some-times imagined that his sinnes had beene hidden, and that hee could not bee punished, for that CHRIST had made satisfaction for them: but then hee knew too late, that those things belonged onely to the elect and chosen of GOD, betwixt whose sinnes, and the heauenly and celestiall Throne, IESVS CHRIST setts his precious bloud, and the dignitie of his obedience, as a vale and shadowe to couer them: and doth plant them against the diuine vengeance, as a high and strong Rampar, that sinners repenting them, might not bee opprest nor drowned with the deluge and ouer-flowings of their offences and sinnes. As for himselfe, seeing that hee had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced our Sauiour IESVS CHRIST, hee had as one should say, ouerthrowne this strong Rampar with his owne hands, so as after this ruine and ouer-flowing,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:3511:104"/>
the deluge of waters of this vengeance, had couered and swallowed vp his soule. One of his most familiars said vnto him, that he did hold the cause of this his great torment to proceed from aboundance of melancholie humours, which did so trouble his braine. SPIERA re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring, that hee had many times refuted that opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and seeing they were to begin againe, sayd vnto the other, you may thinke what you please: but GOD in trueth hath troubled my spirit, and depriued mee of iudgement, seeing it is impossible for mee to haue any hope of my saluation. Hauing continued in such and the like speeches, during his aboad at <hi>Padoua,</hi> they carryed him backe to his house at <hi>Ciuitelle,</hi> where hee dyed in this despaire. This which is worthy of consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration among the Histories of our time, is drawne out of a discourse published by Maister HENRIE SCRINGER, a learned Lawyer, who was then at <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doua,</hi> did see and many times talke with this poore SPIERA.</p>

despaire, spake to him of the mercies of GOD, alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing certaine passages of the Scripture to that purpose. But insteed of turning vnto GOD, and asking pardon for his offences, he sayd vnto him; O STEPHEN how black thou art? the young man who was redish hayrd, excused himselfe: the Aduocate replyed againe, how black thou art? but it is with thy sinnes. That is true answered the Clarke, but I hope in the bounty and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of GOD: then expounding his saying at large, PONSENAS began to cry out like a desperate man, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing his seruant, as one of the wickedest and most mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable men in the world.

By which meanes he was drawne vp hauing beene as it were frozen in the Well, they carried him to bedde, where he lost his speech and opened his eyes very seldome and that with paine. Being sent for to visit him, I spent all that daie in fighting with the apoplexy. At length hee began to stirre a little, and to mutter forth some words, but vomyting exceedingly. The next daie I found him come to himselfe againe and talking: hee tould mee howe that night that hee was so in the well hee dreamt that hee was walking, and with stumbling had like to haue fallen, and that him thought hee had beene ouer head and eares in water.

In a village called <hi>Ostbrouch</hi> neere vnto <hi>Vtrech</hi> there dwelt a widowe, who had a seruant whome shee imployed about necessary affaires of the house. He hauing obserued, (as seruants are often cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious) that this widowe went late in the night, when all were at rest, into one certaine place in the stable, stret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching forth her hands vpon the racke, whereas they vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally put haie for their Cattell. Hee wondring what it ment, resolued to do as much without the priuity of his Mistresse, and to trie the effect of this ceremonie. Soone after, following his Mistresse who was gone into the sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, hee goes and takes hold of the racke. Sodenly hee feeles himselfe to be lifted vp into the aire, and to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into a Caue vnder grownd in a little Towne called <hi>Vuich,</hi> whereas hee found a Synagoge of Sorcerers, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uising togither of their witch-crafts.

She beganne to bee in a great rage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, fearing least those mighty assemblies should be descouered by that meanes, yet shee consulted with her companions what was to be done in that difficultie. In the ende they concluded to entertaine this new guest

In these Consultations the time was spent, and the houre of departure approched. Then they make an other consultation at the instance of the Mistresse; whether for the preseruation of many, it were not expedient to cut the seruants throte, or to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie him backe. By a common consent they inclyned to the milder course, to carry him backe againe, seeing hee had taken his oath not to reueale any thing.

The master of the house suspecting there were some theeues did runne to that place. Whereas hee found not any

man, but hee still herd the same voice in the garret, and from thence on the toppe of the Chimney. Then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming it should bee some euill spirit, hee sent for two Preestes to coniure it, who hauing begunne their exorcis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, the spirit answered them, that hee cared not for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for the one was a whore-hunter, and both were theeues, so as in despight of all they could doe, hee would burne the Towne, as he had vndertaken. Some thought it was for Ielousie which hee had conceiued against the hostes Sonne and the maide of the house, of whome hee had had carnall knowledge, by the space of foureteene years, as she confessed afterwards at her death. Hauing ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore raised this creature in an instant, to the toppe of the Chimney, he deliuered fire into her hand, commanding her to fire the Towne, the which shee did, so as in lesse then an houre all was consumed to ashes, neither could water or vineger quench this fire.

The slames flew to the gate of the Fish-market, and consumed all that it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred betwixt that and the Iewes Streete, whose houses were burnt to Ashes. Neither was it possible by any meanes to quench this fire, so as it continued all night, and the next day, euen vnto the euening, haue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wasted and consumed the best part of the Cittie, and Suburbes thereof, vnto the Sea-shoare. <hi>The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nales of Turkie.</hi>

            <p>In the yeare 1546. on Saterday the seuenth of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust, fire fell from Heauen, vpon <hi>Macklin</hi> in <hi>Brabant,</hi> and fiered a Tower, where was a hundred Barrels of poulder. This Towre was quite ouer-throwne, with a peece of the Towne wall, of two hundred paces, neere vnto the sayd Towre. Then the fire of this poulder tooke hold of the neere places, and did so fire all the Towne, as if a great shower of raine had not falne, this great Cittie had beene consumed to Ashes. The next day they found so many dead carcases, and so stinking, as they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with all speed to make great holes, and to burie them by dozens at a time. All the Sunday was spent in such burials. The number of the hurt exceeded a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fiftie. They found a Woman with Childe smoothered vnder certaine ruines, who beeing speedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye opened, her Childe was found breathing, and was Baptised. A Gentle-woman leaping out of her bedde to open a windowe in her Chamber, her head was cutt off with a Thunder-boult, so as it hung with-out life

by a peece of the skinne. In a corner of a streete, neere vnto BERNARDS Pallace, a Tauerner called CROES, being gone into the Seller to drawe Beere for his guests, whereof some played at Cardes: the house in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was ouer-throwne, the players among others were crusht in peeces, hauing the Cardes yet in their hands, when they drew them from vnder the ruines. No one in the house escaped but onely the hoast, preserued by meanes of the valted Caue into the which hee was gone. Three dayes after this pittifull Accident, there were many found in Caues dead for hunger, others smothered, or fainted away, with the terror and insup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable stinke of the lightning. They found a man and a woman that were carryed away, and as it were tyed fast betwixt the branches of a Tree. The suburbes of <hi>Neckecspsis</hi> were in a maner all ruined. This Cittie so pleasant and fayre before, was all disfigured, and as it were torne in peeces: her stately buildings spoiled and ouerthrowne: among others, the Emperors Pallace, the Lady MARGVERITS, and that of <hi>Berque,</hi> were strooke with lightning, and ouer-throwne. The house of the <hi>Italian</hi> Bankers was quite ruined: the Poste lodging spoyled, and the Stable carryed away with the Horses.

The Count of <hi>Hoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strats</hi> house endured, and brake the shocke of this storme, the which ceased when it had ouer-throwne it. With out it nothing had beene left standing, neyther within the Towne nor about it. There were found huge quarters of free Stone cast by the Tempest, aboue sixe hundred paces from the Wall, to the great hurt of those places where they fell. It was a fearefull Tempest,

<pb n="215" facs="tcp:3511:113"/>
selfe in other things with-in my intention, which is not to exceed the wonders of late dayes, whereof I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce some examples.</p>
            <p>In the Country of <hi>Agenois</hi> is the famous house of BEAV<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>VILLE, some-times very riche, and of great pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions, from the which the Marshall of <hi>Monlucs</hi> wife was descended. It is held for a true History, that the Grand-mother of the sayd Lady had nine Daughters at one birthe, that were all married and had Children. The Mother and the sayd Daughters successiuely were interred at Saint <hi>Crepasi,</hi> the Collegiall Church of <hi>Agen,</hi> built and founded by the sayd house of BEAV-VILLE: the Mother hauing made her Tombe in the Church vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a portall, betwixt nine others which she had also cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to bee made for her Daughters, in memory thereof. I haue seene some of them being at <hi>Agen</hi> in the yeare 1577. in the said Church. The others haue beene ruined during the ciuill warres: And this was the History. The Lady of BEAV-VILLE had a Chamber-maid that was faire and louely, with whom her husband seemed to be in loue, so as she to be honestly rid of her, married her. This Maide at her first lying in, had three children, which made the Gentlewoman suspect that her husband had a share in them, imagining it not possible that one wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man could conceiue by one man such a number of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. The which increased her iealousie, and not-with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing any perswasions, shee began to defame and hate this poore Maide more and more.</p>
            <p>It happened a while after that the Gentlewoman was with child, &amp; so big, as she was deliuered of nine daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. The which they did interpret to bee a punishment sent fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> GOD, that she might be ashamed of her slander
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:3511:114"/>
seeing they might obiect vnto her a greater fault, as if she had beene familiar with many, for shee did alwaies obstinately maintayne, that a woman could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue aboue two Children by one man. Beeing much ashamed, fearing to be diffamed, and condemned by her owne sentence, she was so tempted by the euill spirit, as shee resolued to cause eight of her Daughters to bee drowned, and to keepe one: keeping the matter secreat betwixt the Mid-wife and her Chamber-maide, to whome this cursed Commission was giuen. But it was GODS will that the husband comming from hunting met with the Chamber-maide, &amp; descouering the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise preserued his innocent Daughters from death, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed them to bee nursed vnknowne to the Mother, and at their Christening called them all BORGVE, by one name, and so hee did the ninth which the Mother had reserued. When they were some-what growne, he caused them all to be brought into his house appareled in one liuery, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing also attired that with in the house of the same sort. Being altogither in one Chamber, hee caused his wife to come in, accompained with their Parents and familyar friends: and bidde her to call BOVRGVE. At this call euery one of the nine answered, where at the Mother was much amazed, and the more for that they were all of the like stature, face, countenance and voice, and in the like apparell, which made her heart to giue that they were her nine Daughters: and that GOD had preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the eight, which shee had exposed, and held to bee dead whereof her husband did satisfie her, reproching vnto her her inhumanity before all the companie, and shewing her that this might chance to confound her in the bad opinion which she had alwaies held of him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning

            <p>I haue heard that in the house of ESTOVRNEAV in <hi>Perigort</hi> there chanced the like Accident about 300. years ago. The Lady had 9. Sons at on birth, and would haue exposed eight of them, the which were happely preserued (through the grace of GOD) by the Fathers meeting them. All nine liued, and were aduanced to great places: foure were of the Church, and fiue of the world. Of the Clergie men one was Bishoppe of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigueux</hi> and Abbot of <hi>Branlaume.</hi> The second was Bishoppe of <hi>Paniez.</hi> The third Abbot of <hi>Grand-Selue,</hi> and the fourth of the house of GOD. Of the secular men, one was the Kings Lieutenant at <hi>Reole</hi> against the <hi>English.</hi> The second had a gouernment in <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gongne,</hi> and the other three were in great credit about the King. All this is to bee seene at this daie painted in a great Hall, in the Castell of <hi>Estourneue,</hi> as the <hi>Seigneour</hi> of <hi>Estourneau</hi> hath tould mee, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing issued from that famous and verie ancient house, and nowe Steward of the King of <hi>Nauarres</hi> house, which is now King of <hi>France. The same Author liber.</hi> 4. <hi>Chapter</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>That of the <hi>Pourcelets</hi> of <hi>Arles</hi> in <hi>Prouence,</hi> is almost like vnto this, out of the which is issued the Noble house of the <hi>Conuertis:</hi> who were so called, for that the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-maide which carried the eight to drowne, beeing met by the husband, sayd that they were Pigges which shee went to drowne for that the Sowe could not keepe them. Some say it came by the curse of a poore wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who begged an almes of the gentlewoman of the house: the sayd poore woman hauing many little
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:3511:115"/>
Children about her. The which the gentlewoman re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proched vnto her, as proceeding of wantonesse, and that shee was too much giuen to men. The poore woman, (who was honest) did then praie, that the gentlewoman might conceiue with as many Children, as a Sowe hath Pigges. It so fell out by the will of GOD, to let the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die vnderstand, that wee must not impute that to vice which is a great blessing.</p>
            <p>They report as much of the Noble famelie of <hi>Scroua</hi> at <hi>Padoua,</hi> which carries a Sowe in their Armes, in <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lien</hi> called SCROFA, and in corrupt Langage <hi>Scroua,</hi> which is the surname of that famelie. In the Annales of <hi>Lombardie</hi> it is written, that in the time of ALGI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MONT the first King of the <hi>Lombards,</hi> there was a strum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet brought in bedde of seauen Sonnes, and that the one of them succeeded the sayd ALGIMONT. IOHN PICVS Prince of <hi>Mirandola</hi> writes in his Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries vpon the second Psalme, that in <hi>Italie</hi> a <hi>Germaine</hi> woman was brought in bedde at twise of twentie Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, at the first birth shee had twelue, and that the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then was so heauie, as shee was faine to keepe it vp with a towell. ALBVCACIS a great Physition, and an Arrabian Surgion, is a witnesse of a woman that had seauen Children, and of an other that miscarried of fiueteene well proportioned. PLINIE makes mention of one that miscarried of twelue. MARTIN CRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MER in his Historie of <hi>Poland</hi> writes that the wife of the Earle VIRBOSLAS in <hi>Cracouia</hi> was deliuered of sixe and thirtie Children aliue, in the yeare 1269. But that which exceedes all other examples and which is extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordynarie, supernaturall and miraculous, is that which is written of a Countesse of <hi>Holland,</hi> the which LEVVIS
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:3511:115"/>
GVICHARDIN doth set downe in his description of the Lowe Countries, as it is testified in an Abbey neere to the Hage. MARGVERITE Daughter to the Noble Lord, <hi>Plorent</hi> Earle of <hi>Holland</hi> and of <hi>Mathilde</hi> Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to HENRY Duke of <hi>Brabant,</hi> Sister to WILLIAM King of <hi>Germany,</hi> being about two and fortie yeares old, was brought in bed on friday before Easter, in the yeare 1313. (as Histories do write) of 365. Children, males and females, the which (in the presence of many Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Gentlemen) beeing layed orderly in a great basin, were Baptized by a Bishoppe: the males were all called by one name IOHN, &amp; the females ELIZABETH. All died soone after, and so did the Mother, and were buried togither in one graue. L. VIVES; ERASMVS and others which report this Historie, say, that it was for-asmuch as the sayd Ladie had mockt a verie poore woman as shee was a begginge some releefe of her, for that shee carried two Twinnes. Shee did blame her verie much (saying it was impossible that a woman should haue two Children beegotten at one time of one Father. Here-vpon the poore woman made her earnest praier vnto almightie GOD, that (for proofe of her innocencie, beeing wrong-fully accused) that the Countesse might carrie as manie Children at one birth as there were number of seuerall daies in the whole yeare.</p>
            <p>To returne to our Histories of fewer Children at a burthen, wee haue seene a woman at <hi>Aubenas</hi> in <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uares,</hi> who at her first burthen had two Children, at her second three, and at the third foure. At <hi>Orillac</hi> in <hi>Auvergne</hi> the Wife of one called SABATIER, had three Sons at a birth. The first &amp; the last liued 24 houres the
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:3511:116"/>
middle (who therefore was called IOHN of three) came to mans estate; was marryed at <hi>Paris,</hi> and liued long. The Wife of a Capper in <hi>Rouan,</hi> crooked and little, had fiue Sonnes at one birthe, in the yeare 1550. All this is extracted out of Maister L. IOVBERT. <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>chap.</hi> 1. <hi>of his popular errors.</hi> Let vs adde herevnto some other Histories.</p>
            <p>In the yeare 1554. at <hi>Perme</hi> in <hi>Suitzerland,</hi> the wife of IHON GELINGER a Doctor, was deliuered of fiue Children at one birthe, three males and two females. PLINIE talkes of a <hi>Greeke,</hi> who at foure burthens had twenty Children, whereof the most part liued. DALE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CHAMPS in his <hi>French</hi> Chirurgerie writes, that a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle-man of <hi>Sienna,</hi> called BONAVENTVRE SAVELLI, had assured him, that a slaue and Concubine of his, had seuen Children at one birthe, whereof foure were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized. And in our time betwixt <hi>Sarte</hi> and <hi>Maine,</hi> in the parish of <hi>Seaux</hi> neere vnto <hi>Chambellay,</hi> there is a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans house called <hi>Maldemette,</hi> whose wife had the first yeare shee was married two Children, the second yeare three, the third foure, the fourth fiue, and the fift yeare sixe children, whereof she dyed: one of these sixe chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren is yet liuing, Seigneor of that place of <hi>Maldemette</hi> Maister AMB.

            <p>They haue seene often in <hi>Spaine,</hi> a woman deliuered of three Children: and not long since, a woman had foure at a burthen. It was generally reported a good while since, that a great Lady was brought in bedde at <hi>Medina del Campo</hi> of seauen Children. And they say that a Stationers Wife at <hi>Salamanca</hi> had nine. Seeing wee treate of those Admirable Histories, of many Children deliuered at one birthe, I will report what AVICENNE
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:3511:116"/>
doth witnesse in the ninth booke of Creatures, of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who at one birth brought forth 70. Children well proportioned. And ALBERT the Great writes that he hath heard for certaine of a Physition, which beeing cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in a certaine Towne in <hi>Germanie,</hi> to visit a sicke Lady, found that she had beene deliuered at one birth of 150. Children, all wrapt togither in a little filme, as bigge as a mans little finger, all which came forth aliue with their iust proportion. A. TORQVEMADO <hi>in the first daies worke of his hexameron.</hi> It is admirable, that a woman should haue so many Children, so small, and yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned and aliue, as wee haue seene of the Countesse of <hi>Holland,</hi> and other women aboue mentioned by AVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CENNE and ALBERT. For the explayning of the whole. I will adde that which CONSTANTIVS VAROLIVS a learned Physition at <hi>Bolonia</hi> the fatte doth write in the 4. booke of his anatomie. I haue seene (saith hee) an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bortiue frute of three weekes, confusedly proportioned of the bignesse of a barley curnell, where <hi>I</hi> did note the head and the brest, but no armes nor thighes. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer I haue seene an other of sixe weekes old, hauing a distinct forme of the bignes of a Bee, where did appeere the eyes, the nose, the mouth, the heart, the lights, the ribbes, the backe, the liuer, the Midriffe, the stomacke, the reines, the bowells, the yard &amp; other parts: the which I shewed vnto many. The armes and thighes beganne to bud forth, beeing very small in proportion to the rest of this little Bodie, for the thighes were no bigger then a graine of mill, and the armes twise as bigge. I haue seene many other such aboriue fruits, of the bignesse of a beane, a snaile or a frog. Whereas I haue alwaies found all the parts, and did euer obserue that the extremities
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:3511:117"/>
were lesse in proportion then the rest: in such sort not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, as the spirit quickning this masse, doth fas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shon and shape all the partes thereof togither: but hee doth bring in successiuely the fall and perfect fynishing of the forme.

Yet a Childe was drawne from her which was not so rotten, (the which was admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable) but it might well bee discerned for a male.

Let vs adde a third meruaile: at a yeares ende shee conceiued, and bare an other Sonne his full time. The time of her deliuerie beeing come, beeing in some great difficultie, and almost without any possible meanes to bee deliuered like vnto other women. COR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NAX was called the second time, who aduised the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and other women there present, that they should suffer her to bee opened, as at the former time: giuing verie manie reasons for his Counsell wherevnto the young woman yeelded.

gaine sayed, retired with the Surgion who had made the former section. But presently after the young woman dyed and could not bee deliuered.

            <p>A friend of mine a man of a great spirit and worthie of credit, beeing one night at <hi>Naples</hi> with a kins-man of his, heard the voice of a man crying out for helpe in the streete. Whereat he arose, lighted a candle, and ranne out to see what it was, and comming into the streete hee sawe an horrible fantosme of a dreadfull and furious as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, which would haue carried away a young youth, that cried out and struggled with him aswell as he could: but seeing him comming, hee ranne suddainely vnto him, and caught him fast about the middle, and after his feare was some-what past, hee beganne to call vpon GOD, whereat the fantosme vanished presently away. My friend carried this young man to his lodging, and after hee had comforted him, hee would haue sent him home: but hee could not get him to go by any meanes, for the youth was so frighted that hee shaked euery ioynt of him through the apprehension of so hideous an encounter. At last being some-what come to himselfe, hee confessed that till then hee had lead a very wicked life, that hee had beene a contemner of GOD, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient to his Father and Mother, whom he had so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerably misused that they had cursed him.

Vpon the way hee met the Diuell, in the likenesse of a desperate ruffian, with long haire, and rag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged apparel, who comming to him, demanded the cause of his discontent. The young man answered that hee had beene at some wordes with his Father, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to be meete with him some way or other. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto the Diuell replyed that such an inconuenient had befallen him, and therefore desired him they might keepe company togither, for to deuise some meanes to bee reuenged of the wrongs they had sustained. Night approching they went into an Inne, and lay togither in one bedde. But the wicked fiend, when the young man was a sleepe caught him by the throate, and had strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him, if hee had not awaked and called to GOD for helpe. Wherevpon the Diuell vanished away, and in his departure so shaked the Chamber, that both the roofe and walles crackt in sunder. Whereat this young man was greeuiously terrified with such a soddaine spectacle, and almost dead with feare, repented him of his wicked life, and guided from thence forward by a better spirit, became an enemy to vice, past the rest of his life farre from the rumors of people, and serued for a good example to his neighbors. <hi>In the same booke and Chapter.</hi>

Of which incision shee was soone cured: but the contusions which the Mid-wiues made in the priuy parts, troubled the Surgion aboue seuen months to cure them; shee had also a fayre Daughter, which liued healthfully aboue seuen moneths: but on the eyght shee fell sicke beeing at nurse in the same Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, whereof shee died. A while after shee grewe great and bigge againe, carrying the child hanging alwayes towards the rupture which remained as in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers but without any paine.

But shee could not be deliuered no more then before, for one of the aboue named causes, as it is to be presumed. And therefore she did voluntarily desire to haue an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision made as before, the which shee could not obtaine (by any intreaty) of two yong Surgions sent thither ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly from <hi>Neuffuille,</hi> wheras they kept, after PHILIP, who died of the plague: which was the cause that both she and her fruite dyed pitifully together through theyr faintnesse, if the weakenesse of the Woman or some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pittifull accident, did not stay them from doing it. <hi>The same.</hi>

<pb n="265" facs="tcp:3511:138"/>
made an incision on the right side, something bending and with a small Orifice, to spare the mother, which caused her to feele great paynes in the extraction of the child, for that the Matrix could not deliuer the child for the straitnesse of the ouerture, which paynes notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing ceassed presently when as the child and that which followes were deliuered. So after the ordinary dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges of a woman in child-bed (which came as well as if she had bin naturally brought in bed) within a while after shee did rise, and had her termes accustomed at the ende of fiue weekes: and presently after shee conceiued againe in the ende of May, beeing somewhat troubled with the fresh remembrance of that was past, taking care what might happen of her beeing nowe with child; at which time she was deliuered naturally. And although the child did at the first present but one of the legges, (which was a bad beginning) yet the same beeing put backe by the Mid-wife, all succeeded happely. Since which time beeing with child againe, shee had a happy deliuery, and was afterwards very healthfull. <hi>The same.</hi>

And which is a thing yet more wonderfull, foure men stood leaping with long peeces of wood vpon his belly: Besides this hee brake with his teeth and hands a Horse-shoe, with such force, that one part remained betweene his teeth, and the rest in two peeces, in either hand one. At the third blow with his fist, he brake a Plow-share: hee lickt the Plow-share with his tongue, being taken red hotte out of the fire: he was couered with a great pile of stones, but he neuer sturd one iot, but remained firme and inuiolable, as if he

she still drew some commoditie, being of her selfe allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and stately in apparrell, stuffe, feasts and all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs thereto. This young <hi>Modenois,</hi> who had good meanes, began to frequent this entrie to hell, and within a while was so drunke with the intising baites of this Curtizan, as he did not cease to pursue her in that sort, as from that time they concluded a mutuall and cordiall loue betwixt them. They liued in this estate about three yeares, that the <hi>Modenois</hi> did enioy, and was enioyed of this CALORE, to whom hee gaue his person and his goods, more freely then hee would haue done to a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full wife. Shee did handle him cunningly, but one day as shee plaied at Chesse with a certaine gentleman, it chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that smiling, shee tooke this gamester by the hand, and griped it, like vnto a woman of her trade.

               <pb n="294" facs="tcp:3511:153"/>About the yeare 1528. there chanced at <hi>Rimini</hi> a towne in <hi>Romagnia,</hi> a notable Historie. A certaine yong gentle-woman, married to an old gentle-man, forgetting her honour, did prostitute her selfe villanously to a yong gentle-man of the place, caled PANDOLPHO, continuing their infamous course by the means of a chamber-maid that was their bawde, for the space of two yeares. There was in the chamber of this wretched woman, a great coffer, where shee did put some part of her iewels and money, in the which her adulterer did hide himselfe, if at any time hee were in danger to bee surprised, and could not escape. This coffer had a vent for aire in a secret place, so as PANDOLFO continued sometimes long there. It happened at the ende of this time, that GODS di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine iustice began to call this Adulteresse to an account, by a grieuous and incurable sickenes, who finding her selfe abandoned of the Physitions, was yet more in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of her soule. Her husband comming about mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night vnlooked for, PANDOLFO casts himselfe into the cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, shutting it easily of himselfe. Then this woman tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sported with some horrible spirit, began (after some speech) to make an humble request vnto her husband, making him to promise with an oath, that he should not refuse her. Which was, that he should put into her tomb in the caue, neere vnto her coffin, that coffer which shee shewed him, without looking himselfe, or suffering a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one to looke into it, hauing certaine stuffe in it, which shee would not haue any one to vse after her. The which request the husband did graunt her. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable PANDOLFO vnderstood these terrible words, which made him to curse his owne wickednesse a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand times, and his adulteresse withall, who within two
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:3511:153"/>
houres after died, without repentance or confession of her wicked sinnes, beeing desirous to drawe him with her vnto death, that had beene the companion of her wicked life.</p>
            <p>After her death, as they gaue order for her Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, some seruants and kinsfolkes would haue him leaue this coffer in the house, or at the least, that they should open and visit it. But the husband holding the solemne promise made by him, hindered the opening thereof, and caused it to bee carried out shut, the which after the Obsequies were made, was let downe with the coffin into the Caue, and a great Tombe-stone laied vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it without morter, for that it was now night, and that they meant to finish all the next day. Miserable PAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DOLFO, hearing them sing in Saint <hi>Cataldes</hi> Church, made his account then to die in the coffer, and in tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling vp and downe, he felt certaine bagges full of ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels, but hauing no minde of golde nor siluer, hee di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposed himselfe to other thoughts, when as GOD would giue him newe respight, to haue a better care of his conscience and life than hee had formerly had.</p>
            <p>A young man of the house who knewe that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceassed had good stuffe in the Coffer, and beeing co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous of such a booty found meanes to enter about ten or eleuen a clocke at night into Saint <hi>Cataldes</hi> Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whereas the Caue and Sepulcher of the deceassed was. With the help of two of his companions, he lifts vp the stone and beginnes to get open the Coffer, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to carry away a good prey. PANDOLFO (taking a sodaine resolution in so strange an accident) doth rise, and gets out of the coffer, with such a noise, as the rest
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:3511:154"/>
thinking it had beene some Diuell, fled away speedily. PANDOLFO being come to himselfe, lights a Torche, and visiting the Cofer, lodes himselfe with Iewels, and money which hee found there: and going out of the Church, past by the Couent gardens vnto his owne house. I leaue it to the Reader to iudge, if hee had not reason to thinke of GODS helpe, and to amend his life. <hi>Hist of Italie.</hi>

            <p>Now his wife hauing heard no tydings of him in eight yeares before, one named ARNOLD TYLLIER some call him ARNOLD of TILL) borne in the Country of FOIX, who as many thinke was brought vp in magick, tooke vpon him to play the person of MARTIN GVERRE, furthered therein, aswell with his long absence, as also that in the lineaments of his face hee some-what resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled him. Presenting himselfe vnto the woman, at the first shee would not acknowledge him for her hus-band: but besides the conformity of bodie, hee discouered so many secretts vnto her that had past betweene them two, especially in the night after their marriage, yea
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:3511:158"/>
euen to the very apparell hee had left behinde him in a Chest, at the time of his departure: Things which could not bee knowne but by the right husband: that at length not onely she, but the most part of his kins-folkes and friends acknowledged him for MARTIN GVERRE: &amp; in this opinion 4. years past without any contradiction. At the end whereof a soldier trauelling that way told that MAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIN GVERRE had lost a leg. Not long before this woman was entred into some suspition of her supposed husband: by means wherof she tooke wittnesse vnder hand before two Notaries of the soldiers report. Which to say truly, was but onely vpon heare-say: neuertheles it was the first foundation of this wretched TILLIERS misfortune. For as it is hard for a lier not to vary, so the woman gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red diuers speeches fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, that made her to misdoubt him: and indeed solly cited by PETER GVERRE, MARTINS Vnckle, she not onely abandoned him, but sued him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily before the Seneschall of <hi>Rieux,</hi> where hee was condemned to death by sentence, from the which he appealed to the Parliament of <hi>Tholouse,</hi> which was infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely trobled about the strangnesse of the case. For on the one side, TILLIER discouered all the particularities from point to point that had past betweene him &amp; BERTRAND before his going away, and the talke they had had the first night they lay togither. As also how after they had beene married some 7. or 8. years going into the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try to one of their kins-folkes wedding, because they lacked roome, &amp; that therfore his wife was to lie with another woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it was deuised betweene them, that when the rest were a sleepe, he shold come &amp; lie with his wife. likewise howe they had had a Child, naming the Priest that baptized it, &amp; the God-fathers that were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

all with such a resolution and boldnesse that the woman could not tel what to say: adding the motiues of his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, &amp; the trauells he had sustained both in <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>France.</hi> Which perticularities were fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d afterward to be true, by the report of MARTIN GVERRE himselfe. That which makes this History more meruaylous, was that this supposed hus-band had neuer conuersed with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The presumptions that yet made for him were a double tooth, a naile growing into the flesh on the right hand, certaine moles, and a red spot in one eye, euen as MARTIN GVERRE had &amp; further in that he some-what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled his sisters, who were so besotted, that they auou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched him for their brother. On the other side that which made against him was that a soldier hauing called him ARNOLD by his name, hee praied him in his eare not to cal him so but MARTIN GVERRE. Besides the which she brought proofe of an Vnckle of his, who seeing him in the way of perdition, came lamenting vnto him, desiring him not to cast himself vtterly away. But these proofes were not sufficient to disannull the former, for to all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections that were made against him, he answered confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, laying all the cause &amp; plotting of his troble on PE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TER GVERRE his Vnckle, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had threatned a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to make him yeeld an account of the gardianship that he had sometimes had of him. And for to giue some collour to his saying, hee desired that his wife might bee sworne, to see whither shee would acknowledge him for her right husband or no: declaring that he would put his life or death vpon her oth. Which so amazed her that she would not accept it. These circumstances so mooued the Iudges that they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted the Vnckle and the Niepce to seuerall prisons, to the end one should not prompt the
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:3511:159"/>
other. Thinking the woman was drawne to make this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation by the Vnckle, who was in danger of his person.</p>
            <p>As the Iudges were in this suspence, it fortuned that the right MARTIN GVERRE came home; where at the first sight al his neighbors knew him, &amp; therewithall being aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised of the pranke the other had playd him he went di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to <hi>Tholousa,</hi> where he made petitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be admitted as a party in the cause. Then were the Iudges more ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed then before: because that ARNOLD with an impudent boldnes maintained that this was a Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nicatching knaue suborned by his aduersaries. In this difference, the Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, for to be assured of the truth, sent for the Vnckle out of prison, &amp; set MAR. GVERRE among a great many others apparelled in the same apparel as the counterfet was, to see whither he would know him or no: but presently he went and picked him out from the rest and with great to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of ioy &amp; gladnesse welcomed him home. The like did BERTRAN, crauing pardon for the wrong she had vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wittingly done him. Neuertheles her husband not taking her words in good paiment, with a frouning countena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce began to accuse her. How is it possible (sayd hee) that thou shouldst lend consent to this abuse? for in mine Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ckle, &amp; sisters, there may be some excuse. But none in the priuity that is betweene the man &amp; his wife. And in this anger hee perseuered a long time, notwithstanding any perswasion could be vsed to the contrary. Which drewe the Iudges to thinke that it was a very pregnant presu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to approue him for the right husband. But yet that which held the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in some doubt, was that they of the court examyning MAR. GVERRE, whither euer he had receiued the Sacrament of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmation, he answered that he had, in the towne of <hi>Pamieres,</hi> &amp; named the time, the Bishop, his God-fathers and God-mothers. Whervnto ARNOLD

seperately made the like answere. Notwithstanding the which at last, by sentence in the month of September 1560. he was declared, attainted &amp; conuicted of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wherof he was was accused, and therfore condemned to do penance in his shirte with a torch in his hand, first in open Court, &amp; afterward before the dore of the chiefest Church in <hi>Artiguls,</hi> and lastly to be hanged, and then his body to bee burned til it were consumed to ashes. This Iudgement was giuen at <hi>Tholouse</hi> in the middest of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember, and afterward executed: this wretched man ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing before he died acknowledged the truth of this histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which was written since and published by M.

Sons THEODOR the Lawier and HENRY Doctor of Physick were present) that once in <hi>Paris</hi> he had seene such another impostor as EVRYCLES, who was called PETER the BRABANÇON. This fellow when he listed spake out of his belly, holding his mouth open, but neuer wagged his lippes: &amp; by such dexterity, or the working of the Diuil he connicatched diuers folkes. He fel in loue with a faire yong <hi>Parisian,</hi> whose Father was dead: and not able to induce the Mother to let him haue her. As they were in talke togither about it, hee began to send forth a voice out of his body, as if the deceased hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plained that he was tomented in Purgatory, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his widow did not giue her Daughter to <hi>Brabanson,</hi>
               <pb n="309" facs="tcp:3511:160"/>
who had so often demanded her, &amp; was so honest a man. The woman terrified with such complaynts, and hauing compassion of her husband, consented to this Connicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers desire, who togither with the maide sought also for a certaine great summe of money that was left her by her Fathers will, as it appeared shortly after. For within halfe a yeare after he was married to her, &amp; that hee had spe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t all her portion, he left her with his Mother in law, &amp; ranne away to <hi>Lions.</hi> There hee learnt that a rich Banker died not long before, who in his life time had had a very bad name by reason of his vsurie and extortions. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon he went and found out this Bankers onely Son and heire, that was walking in a gallery fast by the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, and told him he was sent vnto him, to acquaint him with a matter of great importance which very much co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned him. There-withall as he was exhorting him, to haue more regard to his late Fathers credit and soule, then to his death, suddainly was heard a voice cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>terfet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Father, which BRABANÇON sent out of his belly, and in the meane time with a singular dexterity made as though he were wonderfully amazed at it. By this voice the Sonne was admonyshed of the estate wherevnto the Father was reduced by his wickednesse, and with what paine hee was tormented in the fire of purgatory, aswell for himselfe as for his Sonne whom hee had left heire of all his goods gotten with an euill conscience: declaring that hee could not bee deliuered, vnles his Sonne made dewe satisfaction, bestowing almes on those that were then in most neede of them: which were the Christians prisoners with the <hi>Turke:</hi> and that therefore he should rely on him that talked with him, who was sent to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople</hi> by diuers other good folkes: and was also very
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:3511:161"/>
opportunely directed by GOD vnto him for the same effect. The Sonne, who was none of the wisest in the world, although hee suspected no deceite, yet not very well digesting this word of furnishing money, answered he would thinke vpon it, and appointed BRABANÇON to meete him againe the next day in the same place. In the meane while he was in a meruailous perplexity, mistrus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the place where hee had heard the voice, because it was close, &amp; fit for knauery. Wherfore the next day hee carried BRABANĈON into an open place, where was neither bush nor any other Couert. Notwithstanding talking to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither the Son heard the old song with this new addissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that without any delay he should giue BRABANĈON 6000. franks &amp; should cause 3. Masses to be sung euery day for the saluation of his Fathers soule, who otherwise was damned for euer. The Son being conscionable, &amp; as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonished, without any more deliberation (il-gotten goods hauing wings) deliuered the Impostor the sum of 200. pound neuer taking any receipt, or wittnesse of matters how they past: the father came no more to importune his Son, but remained quiet. As for the Son, after he had bid BRABANĈON adiew (&amp; got him out of <hi>Lyons</hi> with his prey) shewing himselfe some what merier then he had vsed to be, &amp; the other Bankers wondring at it, he told them the occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whervpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they laughed him to skorn, for that he had so foolishly suffered himself, to be Connicatched, &amp; discouered the imposture vnto him: which so strock him to the heart that within a little after he died with griefe, &amp; went to his Father for to know the truth of the matter.

As also how hauing beene very much vrged by the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre,</hi> to shewe him the place where such great treasures lay, and the meanes to come by them, because hee would not be constrained so to do, he had retired him-selfe as it were euen out of the closet of the Court and seruice of the sayd King of <hi>Nauarre.</hi> The King and his Mother glad of such newes gaue good entertainme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to ALLARD, whose comming being published in the Court, amongest many others he insinuated himselfe into the company of <hi>Monsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eur de</hi> CLERVAN, &amp; gaue him to vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that he had pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of great importance at <hi>Rome,</hi> which hee could not well come by but by meanes of the <hi>Suissers,</hi> who if they would but write vnto the Pope about them, he should be sure to haue them restored againe for their sakes.

            <p>Here-with CLERVAN returned to <hi>Coppet</hi> which was fast by <hi>Geneua,</hi> where hee talked with a great Merchant called IOHN TERNAVLT, about the matter, &amp; reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted him to communicate it to Coronell PSIFFER of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne:</hi> AMMAN LVCY of <hi>Vnderwald,</hi> and other Lords of the 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Cantons, being at that instant in those quarters: which was executed, &amp; they harkned vnto it, reseruing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion vntill such time as they bad conferred in person with ALLARD and CLERVAN, who being aduertised that these <hi>Switzer</hi> Lords were come into <hi>France</hi> (which was about Nouember and December 1582.) they went vnto them to <hi>Paris,</hi> where hauing made some entry into the matter, it was resolued they should meet at S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Iames</hi> his Hospitall to conclude this affaire.

<pb n="315" facs="tcp:3511:163"/>
a notorious Impostor. Neuertheles he so oiled his to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gue, hauing the <hi>French, Dutch,</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> naturally, that in a new assembly with these Lords, he declared vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a demure and graue manner, as his custome was, that he was about to contract with the King, vnto whom hee was to lend 2. millions of gold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 15. daies after the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made; that is to say, 160000. crownes in ready mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and 400000 crownes to be raised on the late Lord Constables goods, whose Bill he said he had; &amp; had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to deliuer it vnto the King; who was there withall well pleased, as ALLARD affirmed. Only he had stood vpon securitie for so notable a summe of money, &amp; that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Councel promised to assure him the Salt <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pits of <hi>Brouage,</hi> and the reuene w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>As affaires past in this manner, my Lady had intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the speech. ALLARD had vsed, touching the late L. Constables Bill: whereupon shee wrote that they should take heede of this pratler; affirming her Lord was
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:3511:164"/>
not so bad an husband, as to be indebted in such a summe to a stranger, who at length would proue to be a Cunny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catching k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>aue. There came a <hi>Rocheller</hi> also that warned diuers to beware of ALLARD, which moued TARNAVLT to write by a trusty messenger to <hi>Monsieur</hi> GARGO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VILAR, the Mayor of <hi>Rochell,</hi> who returned answer that ALLARD was a notable deceiuer. The <hi>Suizter</hi> Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors hauing sworne the league with the King, left TER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NAVLT in the Court for the expedition of certaine af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires they had there: going to take horse, ALLARD ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with honourable personages, participants in the businesse: promised them, that at TERNAVLTS de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture he would send a couple of men along with him, with the 6500. crownes appointed for the voyage to <hi>Rome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> when TERNAVLT was ready to set forth on his iourney his men were not: but promised to be at <hi>Lyons</hi> assoone as hee: offring notwithstanding to deliuer him this summe of 6500. Crownes, if he would stand to the venture, which he refused to doesince ALLARD and his associates were to send after him.</p>
            <p>Not long after the <hi>Suitzers</hi> departure, the Pope ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertised of ALLARDS being in the Court of <hi>France,</hi> complained to the King of him, who committed him to prison, where hee found a certaine Gentleman naming himselfe the Earle of <hi>Sanssy,</hi> a man of a quick spirit, and father to three or foure sonnes, whereof one had beene brought vp with the Elector <hi>Palatine,</hi> as also to one Daughter, whom during this imprisonment he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to one DV VAL by ALLARDS meanes, that said he was DV VALS Vnckle, and promised to giue him two hundreth thousand crownes to his marriage. But all this practise remained vnperfected, by reason of this which
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:3511:164"/>
ensueth. Within a while after was enlarged, whereupon he desired TERNAVLT by letters to come to him to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> wherein TERNAVLT excused himselfe, certifying the other, that if he would come into <hi>Switzerland, Sau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>y,</hi> or to <hi>Lausanne, Geper, Morges,</hi> &amp; other places adioyning, TERNAVLT would meete him.</p>
            <p>Vpon these letters, ALLARD set forth, accompanied with two of the Earles sonnes, and his traine, and came into the countrey of <hi>Burg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ngny,</hi> where he intruded him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe into the acquaintaince of a gentleman of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, whom with great promises hee carried along with him to <hi>Morges,</hi> and there lodged at the signe of the white Crosse. From thence he sent to <hi>Geneua</hi> for TERNAVLT, who beeing arriued, ALLARD would haue induced him to haue lent him a thousand crowns; adding that he desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that TERNAVLT would take the paines to goe into <hi>Sweathland,</hi> to receiue eighteene hundred thousand dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars for him, and he should haue an hundred thousand of them for his labour. And further, hee promised a very great gift to an honest gentleman, brother in law to the said TERNAVLT, who refusing to meddle in the matter, all contracts were broken off, except it were touching three thousand crownes, which ALLARD was to pay him out of hand: but they are yet to paie.</p>
            <p>This promiser renewed another practise with the Bay liffe of <hi>Lausanne</hi> and <hi>Morges,</hi> who conducted him to <hi>Berne,</hi> where hee contracted with certaine Lords, vnto whom (among other things) hee promised to deliuer an Obligation of the summe of fiue hundred thousand crownes to him due by EMANVEL PHILIBERT Duke of <hi>Sauoy,</hi> which Obligation he said hee had left at <hi>Paris.</hi> Departing from <hi>Berne</hi> with promise to be honoured and
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:3511:165"/>
recompenced, he drew towards <hi>Neuf-chastel.</hi> In the mean time his impostures were discouered on euery hand. It was known that the Duke of <hi>Sauoyes</hi> Obligation, was of the same nature as the Constables Bill, and that all the negotiation with the Embassadors of the small Cantons was but meere knauery on ALLARDS part. Therefore order was giuen that he should be attached at <hi>Neufcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stel:</hi> where fearing it would not bee long ere he should haue terrible articles framed against him, and gathering by some questions which had bin asked him, that part of his impostures were discouered, his traine beeing vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed away euen in an instant, hee resolued with himselfe to inuent all the wayes possibly hee could to escape. But meeting with no certaine meane, one night going to let himselfe down at an high window of the prison, where he was inclosed, that which held him chancing to break, his fall was so high, that he dashed himselfe all to pieces, so giuing an end to his life and impostures both at once.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Burguignian</hi> gentleman whom hee had carried with him to <hi>Morges,</hi> was laid vp in prison and compelled to sell his land for to satisfie the Hoste of the white crosse for ALLARDS expences whilst he lay there. Infinit were the tricks where-with this M. GARDYNER cunnicatched all sorts of persons wheresoeuer he came. It shall suffice for a conclusion, to note the knauish pranke hee plaied the Host of the Stork at <hi>Basil,</hi> where he had lien a long time, and was deepely run in arrereages. When he was going away, in stead of paying, he borrowed a newe summe of money of this honest <hi>Switzer,</hi> and for a pawne left him a Portmanteau made faste with three lockes and strong chaines, affirming it was full of golde, iewels of excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding value, and papers of great importance, promising if
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:3511:165"/>
it were well kept till his returne, to giue his said Hoste thirtie thousand Dollars besides his due. The newes of his death comming to <hi>Bafil,</hi> the poore Hoste in a marue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous pitteous taking, went with the leaue of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, and got this Portmanteau to bee opened, which was found full of nothing but brickes and stones finely packed vp together. <hi>I had this Discourse from Monsieur</hi> TERNAVLT, <hi>in whose hands I haue seene diuers contracts, acts and writings, approouing some part of the History of this notable Impostor.</hi>

Or as GVICHARDIN saith, If the Citty of <hi>Millan</hi> would furnish him with thirty thousand Duckets for a moneths pay, that the armie should depart out of <hi>Milan,</hi> and lodge some other where: assuring them that though at other times they had beene deceiued with the like pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, they should not be so then, because he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer go against his word and faith, on which they might safely relie: adding, that he prayed GOD, if he brake his promise with them, his head might bee taken from his shoulders with the first shott of the enemies artillerie. Vpon this promise the <hi>Millanois</hi> strained themselues, and paide him the summe. But they were so oppressed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, that many through dispaire hung themselues, others threw themselues downe head-long from the tops of their houses, and brake their owne necks. Shortly wher-vpon, the Duke of <hi>Bourbon</hi> marched forth with his armie, and drew towards <hi>Rome</hi> for to surprise it, but hee was slaine with an Harguebuse shott in the assault, which many (saith BELLAY) attribute to the diuine venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, because hee kept not the promise which hee made with such an imprecation to the <hi>Millanois.</hi> His death <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>To this purpose I will adde another Historie, though it be ancient, reported by ALBERT CRANT <hi>in his</hi> 6. <hi>Booke of the affaires of Saxony, Chap.</hi> 45. where hee writes that the Emperor FREDERICK the first, being in Saint PETERS Monastery at <hi>Erford,</hi> the floore whereon hee went, suddenly sanke vnder him, and if he had not caught hold on an Yron barre of a window, hee had fallen into the Iakes of the Monasterie: wherein certaine Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men fell and were drowned, amongst the which was HENRY Earle of <hi>Schuartzbourg,</hi> who carried the presage

of his death in an vsuall imprecation, If I do this or that: I would (said he) I might be drowned in the Iakes.</p>
            <p>But omitting other ancient Histories, it being no part of our purpose to touch them in these collections, but reseruing them for some other hand and worke.

               </gap> his money to keepe. Not long after, being recouered, he asked it againe of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who had agreed before with her husband to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it. Wherefore she denyed that she had any of him, and rayled at him, as if he had done her wrong to aske it: whereat the traueller was so enraged, that he accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed her of disloyaltie and theft: which the Host hearing, he tooke his wiues part, and thrust the other out of dores, who iustly incensed with such dealing, drew his sworde and ranne against the gate. The Host began to crie out that hee went about to breake into his house and robbe him. For which cause the Souldier was apprehended, carryed to prison, and arraigned before the Magistrate, ready to be condemned to death. The day came where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in sentence was to bee giuen and executed, the Diuill entred into the prison, and tolde the prisoner that hee should bee condemned to dye: neuerthelesse he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him if so bee hee would giue himselfe vnto him, to keepe him from all harme. The prisoner answered, that he would rather dye innocent as he was, then be deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by such means. The Diuil hauing shewed him againe the danger wherein hee stood, and receiuing the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulse, promised not-withstanding, to helpe him for
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:3511:167"/>
nothing, and worke in such sort that he should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenged on his enemies. Hee councelled him then when he should be brought to his tryall, to maintaine that hee was innocent: and to desire the Iudge to let him haue him for his aduocate, whom he should see standing there in a blew Cap, which should plead for him. The priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner accepted the offer: and the next day being brought to the Barre; hearing his aduersaries accusation, and the Iudges opinion, required (according to the custome of the place) that he might haue an Aduocate to plead his cause: which was granted him. This craftye Lawyer stood forth, and very subtilly began to defend his client, alledging that hee was falselie accused, and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence wrongfully condemned: for the Hoste kept a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his money, and had misused him besides: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon hee vp and tolde how the whole matter had past, and declared the place where the money was locked vp. The Host on the other side defended himselfe, and the more impudently denyed it, giuing himselfe to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill both body and soule, if so be he had it. Where-vpon this Lawyer in the blew Cappe, leauing his cause, layde hold on the Host, carried him out of the hall, and hoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted him vp so high in the ayre, that it was neuer knowne what became of him afterward.

            <p>In the Towne of <hi>Rutlingen,</hi> a certaine traueller com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into an Inne, gaue his Hoste a budget to keepe, wherein there was a great summe of money. At his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture asking it againe, the Hoste denyed hee had
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:3511:167"/>
any, and rayled at him for charging him with it. The traueller sued him in the lawe, and because there was no witnesse of the matter, hee was going to put the Host to his oath, who was ready and most desirous to take it, and gaue himselfe to the diuill, if euer he receiued or kept away the Budget that was in question. The plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffe required some respite, to take aduise whether hee should put the defender to his oth or no: and going out of the Court, he met two men, that asked him the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston of his comming thither.</p>
            <p>He vp and told them the matter. Well (sayde they) wilt thou bee contented that we shall helpe thee in the cause. He answred them I, not knowing what they were. Ther-vpon they returned all three into the Court, where the two that came last, began to maintaine against the Hoste, that the Budget was deliuered vnto him, and that he receiued it, and locked it vp in such a place, which they named. The periured wretch could not tell what to reply: and as the Iudge was about to send him to prison, the two witnesses began to say, it shall not need, for wee are sent to punish his wickednesse.

imprecations, and to fall out with GOD, euen to say; That hee could not deale worse with her then to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way her husband. There-vpon shee hung all her house with black, and began to mourne in such sort that shee could not be drawne to receiue any sustenance or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. She did nothing but weepe, lye along on the ground teare her hayre, and demeane her-selfe like a madde wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. Amidst her husbands pompous obsequies (of whom GOMARA writes, that he maried two sisters and was a long time polluted with foule incest) and all this despightfull mourning, shee forgot not to assemble the chiefest of the towne together, and there to make them declare her for Gouernesse of the Country, and to sweare fealtie and obedience vnto her. But now let vs heere what came to passe vpon these imprecations and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spightfull speeches. The 8. of September 1541. it rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned so mightely for 24. houres together, that the next day about nine or ten of the clock at night, two <hi>Indians</hi> came, and aduertised the Bishop of <hi>Guattimall,</hi> how they had heard a meruailous strange noyse at the foote of the Mountaine adioyning to the Cittie. The Bishop sent them away, and told them it was nothing but illusions. But an houre after midnight, an inundation of waters began to rush out at the bottom of the mountaine and to disgorge it selfe on the plaine with such fury: that it ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away whole rocks of an incredible thicknesse. These waters rouling along, cast downe all that they encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred. Amidst the which nothing was heard but fearfull cries in the ayre: &amp; there were some that marked a black Cow amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the waues, which went in &amp; out doing much mischiefe. The first house ouer-whelmed by this deluge was ALVARADOES, where perished BEATRICE his widdow,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:3511:168"/>
with all such as accompanied her in an Oratory, where she was at her deuotions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Instantly after the Towne was buried in the waters. Some sixe score persons men and women were drowned. They which gott away at the beginning of the noyse escaped. When the waters were fallen, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were found hauing their armes and legges all cut and mangled. I will adde this one worde, How a little girle which ALVARADO had begotten on an <hi>Indian,</hi> carryed away with the rest by the floud, was found a good way from the Towne, safe and vn-hurt in any part of her body.

His Mother accused of theft, seeing no other meane to escape had recourse to imprecations: and because she was then big with this child, for to adde more credit to her words, shee made this imprecation; That if the matter were true which shee was charged with, shee prayed GOD
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:3511:169"/>
that the Childe where-with-all shee went, might neuer speake, but continue dumbe as long as it liued. Her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precations discouered her, hauing ioyned periurie to theft. PH. CAMERARIVS <hi>in the</hi> 86. <hi>Chap. of his Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall meditations.</hi>

            <p>Not long since it happened, that a certaine Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man our neighbour, vexing his poore tenants with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precations and curses, constrained them to build his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle. In driuing them to worke, he ordinarily called them his Dogges. Before the building was finished, hee fell sick: and continuing his imprecations and curses, GOD so repressed him, that he became speechlesse: and when I wrote this History, hee could not pronounce any one word distinctly, but barked like a Dog. <hi>The same.</hi>

            <p>Another example no lesse memorable, happened not long agoe in a Princes Court here-by, where a certaine Gentleman being charged with many iniurious wordes spoken at randon: for to couer the matter, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade that the accusation was false, hee began to protest and sweare: adding that he desired of GOD if hee had vsed any such speeches, to shew some token on him, euen at that very instant: or if GOD would not, that then the Diuill would. Presently vpon these words, and other such like imprecations, hee fell downe flatte on his face, being so grieuously taken with the falling siknesse (which hee had neuer felt before) that after hee had<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> tormented and beaten himselfe against the ground, where hee laye foming at the mouth like one halfe dead, he was carried to a Chamber, &amp; there continued very sick, in the yeare 1591. when I collected this Historie, being iustly puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed for his rashnesse &amp; impious imprecation. <hi>The same.</hi>

Another dwelling in the Duchie of <hi>Saxony,</hi> carried a Daughter of hers that was possessed of the Diuell to <hi>Wittenberg,</hi> for to receiue some reliefe, and to commend her to the prayers of the Church. She con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed that this affliction came vpon her Daughter one day, when being in an anger, she had made an imprecati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wishing the Diuel would possesse her: as incontinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he did. Being caried on a time into the Church, as the congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were in praier for her, a learned personage

            <p>At <hi>Friburg</hi> in <hi>Misnia</hi> it fortuned that a Father being in a mighty rage with a Sonne he had, that dispatched not some-thing so soone as he would haue had him, began to say, would to GOD thou mightst neuer stirre fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the place where thou art. It was no sooner sayd, then done: for suddainly the Sonne remained, as it were fastned and nailed to the place where as he stood, and could not bee remooued by any strength or deuise whatsoeuer. And because he could neither bowe nor bend his body for to sit, they set a stay behinde his back, to ease him. Hauing continued in this estate three whole yeares togither, GOD hearing the prayers which were made for this poore Child, permitted that he could sit and stoupe, and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Being asked at any time how he felt himselfe, his vsuall answere was, that GOD did chastice him, and that his mercy knew what issue his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions should haue, which nothing hindered the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that he had of his eternal saluation through IESVS CHRIST. At 7. yeares end, he died peaceably full of the spirit of repentance, faith and hope in the grace of his Sauiour, on the eleuenth day of September, in the yeare a thousand, fiue hundreth, fifty and two.</p>
            <p>Not long ago sayth M. ANDREVVE HONDSDORFE, we sawe an <hi>Almaigne</hi> very poore and sickly, and as wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched and miserable as might be, by reason of the impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations which his Father had made against him a little

            <p>A Mother hauing a very disobedient Sonne, fell downe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> on her knees, and prayed GOD that her wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Childe might bee burnt with a secret fire. This im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precation fell not to the ground: for the Sonne beeing suddainly seized with that fire ouer all his body, beganne to cry, Mother, Mother, your praiers are heard, and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished three dayes in vnspeakeable torments hee was consumed therewith.</p>

They fellow exceedingly affraied ran to Church &amp; aduertised his M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> of it, who ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much dismayd asked Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sell of the minister what he shold do. He hauing finished his sermon willed that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry body shold voide the house. It was no sooner co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded then performed: but with hast that they made to get out, they left a little Child behinde them sleeping in the Cradle. Those guesse, that is to say the Diuils beganne to fling the tables &amp; other things about the house, to roare, &amp; to looke out at the windowes in the likenes of Beares, Wolues, Cats, &amp; terrible men, holding glasses of wine, &amp; dishes of meate in their pawes. As the gentleman to gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the minister and neighbors were in great feare beholding such a sight, the poore Father began to cry, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, where is my Child? Scarce was the word out of his mouth when one of those black guests brought the Child to the windowe in his armes, and shewed it to all that were in the streete. The gentleman almost beside himselfe, sayd to one of his men whom he made most ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of, alack what shal I do? Sir answered his seruant, I wil co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend my life vnto GOD, in whose name I wil en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the house, &amp; through his fauor &amp; assistance bring you your Child.

The ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant sweating with feare, and yet strengthned by GOD, went to the fiend that held the Child, and sayd vnto him, Come, giue me this Child. No marry wil I not answered the other: he is mine. Go bid thy Maister come and fetch him. The fellow insisting sayd, I will execute the charge which GOD hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted vnto me, for I know that all that I doe according there-vnto is acceptable vnto him. Therfore, in regard of mine office, and in the name, assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance &amp; vertue of IESVS CHRIST, I will take this Child from thee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and carry it to the father. Saying so, he caught hold on the Child, and held it fast in his armes. The black guests returned no answere, but roared and cryed out, Hoh sirra let alone the Child, or we will teare thee all to peeces. But he not respecting their menaces went safely away, and presently restored the Child to the gentleman his Maister.

In the end trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with this violent passion, and followed by men which did second him in his humour, hee goes in the night towards this Mill, takes the Maide violently from her father, and carries her to a house of his in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, where shee was rauished. This poore father goes to <hi>Florence,</hi> and attends the Duke at his returne from Masse,
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:3511:176"/>
makes his complaint vnto him, and demands Iustice. The Duke concealing his thoughts, sends him backe to his house, promising to take order for it. Presently after dinner, hee goes to horse, making a shew hee would goe Hunte, and goes towards this Gentlemans house, stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereby in a place of pleasure. The Gentleman ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertised that the Duke was so neere, and drunke with his passion, thinking the Milner would not haue presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to complaine of him, and trusting in his owne cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, he shuts the Maide vp in a secret place of his house, out of the way, and then goes to doe his dutie vnto the Duke, offering him his Pallace for his lodging, the which the Duke doth accept, and seemes to take great delight in the building of this house of pleasure: hee doth visit and view euery part, member, and corner thereof, very curiously, with their ornaments, and causeth all the chambers and Cabynes to be opened: finally he enters into a faire and long gallerie, at the end where-of was a close doore, but painted and inriched with rare de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uises. The Duke seemes to haue more delight in that, then in all the rest, and smiling, hee sayde, That hee thought that it was the Store-house of all his Eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, Treasure, and most precious Iewels. It was the prison of this honest Mayden, that had beene raui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed. And for that the Gentleman made some delaye to open it, the Duke did presently doubt, that what he sought was there, and therefore hee commands them to open it: but the Gentleman pretended, that a seruant of his was gone to <hi>Florence,</hi> and had carryed the Keye with him. But finding the Duke (at these wordes) to bee the more earnest to enter, hee came to him, and after a great reuerence, he tolde him softly in his eare,
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:3511:176"/>
that there was a wench within, the which he was loath to haue seene, vnlesse it were his Highnes pleasure to see her I, I, answered the Duke, it is that I looke for. The gentleman thinking it would prooue but a iest (for that the Duke himselfe was much giuen to such excesse, the which was afterwards the cause of his death) hee opened the doore. Then the poore maide with her haire about her eares, weeping, and vndrest, doeth prostrate her selfe at the Dukes feete, and demaunds iustice for the wrong which had beene done her. Hereupon the Duke doth send presently for the Milner, and doth greatly blame the gentleman, and two of his chiefe confederates. Hee propounds two conditions to the gentlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, either death without remission, or to marry the maide whom he had rauished. The gentleman who did not thinke to escape, seeing his Lord in such choller, accepts of the marriage: and by the Dukes sentence is condemned to giue vnto his wife, three thousand Ducats for her dowrie. Which beeing done in the presence of the Duke, of his traine, and of the Milner, the maide beeing honourably attired, he married her, held her for his lawfull wife, and she was so esteemed, beloued of him, and reuerenced through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all <hi>Tuscanie,</hi> and the Duke was much honoured of all men, for so good an act of iustice. <hi>Histo. of Florence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was a citizen of <hi>Como</hi> kept prisoner by a <hi>Spanish</hi> Captaine, and accused to haue committed a murther, for the which he was in great daunger of his life, in the yeare 1547. The wife of this prisoner beeing faire and of a good grace, but chaste, and very carefull for her husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds deliuerie, went and came solliciting for him, by all the meanes shee could deuise. Presenting her selfe vpon her knees, shee beseeched him to saue his prisoners life.
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:3511:177"/>
This wretch taking her apart, said vnto her, there is one meanes to preserue your husbands life, without the which he must needs die. After some speeches thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he discouers in the end his villanous heart, solliciting her to yield vnto him, with promise that soone after hee would restore her that which shee so much desired. The poore woman beeing fallen into a new affliction, after a long conflict in her thoughts, and an extreame griefe of heart, shee declares vnto her husband the cruell and vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanous desire of the Captaine. The husband desirous to saue his life, perswades his wife to yield vnto the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards bruitish appetite: who hauing enioyed the body of this desolate woman, would also haue her satisfie his coueteousnesse, paying him two hundred crownes. He added to these two horrible crimes, a third, which was most detestable; for hauing caused the husband to bee drawne out of prison, as it were to send him home to his house, and to deliuer him to his wife, who hoped for no lesse. This disloyall Captaine made the poore man to be presently carried backe into prison, and afterwards cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed his head to bee cut off. The woman opprest with griefe, reports all this historie vnto her friends, and by their aduise complaines to the Duke of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing extreamely mooued at these crimes, sends presently for the Captaine, who beeing examined and found guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, he demands pardon: he is first condemned to restore presently the two hundred ducats, and to adde seauen hundred more. Secondly, hee causeth a Priest to come, and forceth the Captain to marry the widow in presence of them all. Thirdly, and at the same instant, instead of a nuptiall bedde, going out of the Church, hee caused a Gybbet to be set vp, whereas the Spanish Captaine was

It happened in the yeare 1537. for Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to apprehend a certaine souldier in passing, who had committed some insolencie that was punishable, but not corporally, beeing but a light offence. Some say, that hauing a good purse, it made them condemne him to die. When as they pronounced this sentence against him, hee sayed vnto them with an assured countenance, You are vniust Iudges, who to please your Soueraignes, or to haue my purse, send me to execution: but if you bee so greedy of siluer, take all that I haue, and let me goe; I neither can, nor would if I might, reuenge mee of the wrong you haue done me, and doe promise you neuer to set my foote more in this place.

            <p>The following History is yet more strange. A Sonne doth so much forget the name and duty of a Sonne, as he accuseth his owne Father to haue had carnall knowledge with a Beast. The Father is imprisoned and put to the rack, where hee confesseth that hee had committed the act. Being from the rack, he denies it, and then confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth it againe, being brought vnto it, his body being so weake, as it was not possible for him to endure such tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments saying, that he had rather dye then be so pulled in peeces.

He is confronted with seuen witnesses, who maintaine that they had heard him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse the fact in prison: where-vpon hee is condemned to bee burned aliue.

who sought his death to be maister of his goods to waste them. He was burnt aliue, died constantly, and his soule went peaceably vnto GOD.

            <p>These Histories of some Iudges, not Iudges, but Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged before GOD, before themselues, and before men, as most vniust and detestable Iudges, are not produced to fauour in any sort the furies of some phantasticall and humerous persons, who for the faults of some few pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate men, haue dared to condemne the lawfull calling of them that administer iustice. Let the vniust learne of them that loue true honor, the peace of their conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the glorie of GOD, and the preseruation of euery mans right, to discharge them-selues honourably and faithfully of their charges. I continue to touch the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iust carriage of some, which may serue the reader as a patterne to put him in minde of many other examples. In our time they haue not beene content to take presents of meate and drinke, for the dispatch of mens sutes: they haue not been contented to see riche stuffes brought in for Mounsieur and my Lady, nor to suffer my Lady and her Daughter, to haue Bracelets, Chaines or Iewels gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen them, without seeming to knowe what it is, or to see any thing: they haue not beene content to aske and take by their house-hold seruants, by their friends and Brokers cunningly set on: They haue not beene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to traffique Iustice with all kindes of trades, to drawe all necessarie implements into their houses: find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing too whotte, too heauie, nor too base: To conclude, they haue solde Orphelins, Innocents,

But they are come now to say, What will you giue mee? and presently to hold forth the hand: yea (without offence to the Prouerbe, which forbids to looke a giuen horse in the mouth) they are now come to handle it, sometimes behinde the backe, seeming to walke with the Merchant, then to looke on it, to sound it, and to peize it, before they once will say, Well, assure your selfe of me.

And oftentimes if he that hath the right, hath giuen lesse than the other that is in the wrong, it prooues vnprofitable. And as one said, the foure horses behind, drawe backe the Coach which the first come had giuen. Nay they haue exceeded farther, asking that, which neither by GODS lawes nor mans can bee lent, sold, nor engaged: the losse whereof is greater, and no lesse irreparable then life. They would haue them buy iustice with a paiement, which is not onely contrary to all honestie and iustice, but whose infamie redounds vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them that are yet vnborne. And to speake in plainer tearmes, in our time there was a President which died an Abbot, who saied vnto an honourable gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that if shee would lend him her fore-part, he would giue her audience.</p>
            <p>They report a Historie of one who did yet worse. It was the Prouost <hi>la Vouste,</hi> who plaied a wicked part with a certaine honest woman. Shee comming vnto him to
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:3511:179"/>
make sure for her husband, whom this Prouost kept in prison, was required to graunt him one nights pleasure, and he would yield to whatsoeuer shee her selfe deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
            <p>This woman finding her selfe much perplexed, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king on the one side to her breach of faith plighted to her husband, and on the other side, his life which she should saue, shee was very desirous to acquaint her husband there-with; who hauing dispenced there-withall, shee then yields vnto the Prouosts brutish desire, resting assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that he would certainly keepe promise with her, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning her husband. But in the morning this most vilde wretch, (after he had caused her husband to be hanged) said thus vnto her, I did promise indeede to restore you your husband, I keepe him not, but I yield him vnto you.</p>
            <p>The same Prouost beeing ready to haue one hanged, the man beeing vpon the ladder, one came and tolde him in his eare, that if hee would deliuer him, and set him free, he should haue a hundred crownes. Where at hee taking some taste, made a signe to the hangman to stay; then studying of some deuise or tricke to make him escape, hee drewe neere, and cried out alowde in his language: Behold my masters, into what danger this wretch had brought me, for hee hath a crowne (hee did equiuocate vpon that word, which signifies a crown of gold, and the crowne of such as begin to bee in <hi>Sacris</hi> (as they speake) and in the first degree to be a Priest) and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer tolde mee of it.

should haue a share in the bootie, as they had agreed. But considering on the other side, that the murmure would bee great if he did not iustice, and that hee should bring himselfe into great danger, hee vsed this meanes. Hee caused a poore honest man to be taken, to whom he said, that hee had beene long sought for, and that hee had committed such and such an act. The man denies it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently, as hauing his conscience cleere from any such crime. But this Prouost beeing resolute, let him vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand that he should get more by confessing it, seeing that howsoeuer, he must loose his life: and if he did confesse it, the Prouost did binde himselfe by oath, to cause so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Masses to bee sung for him, as hee should goe directly into <hi>Paradise:</hi> whereas not confessing it, he should bee hanged notwithstanding, and goe to the diuell; for that there was not any man would sing a Masse for him. This poore man, hearing him talke of death and hell, desired rather to be hanged, and so goe into <hi>Paradise.</hi> So as in the ende he came to say, that hee did not remember that hee had done that where-with they charged him, yet if they did remember it better than he, and were assured therof, hee would take his death in good part: but hee intreated them to keepe promise with him, touching the Masses. He had no sooner spoken the word, but they led him in to the others place that had deserued death. But when he was at the ladder, hee entred into some speech, whereby he gaue them to vnderstand, that he repented him, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all that which they had promised him: for the preuenting whereof, the Prouost made a signe vnto the hangman to dispatch him: and so he was. <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Of the conference of Ancient Wonders with Moderne.</hi>

Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing absteyned three daies, he began to be very hungry. He therefore tooke a bitte of bread, meaning to swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe it with a glasse of beere. But all that stucke so in his throate, as hee remayned forty daies and forty nights without eating or drinking. At the end of this time, he cast out at his mouth the bread and drinke which had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned in his throate. This long abstinence made him so weake, as they were faine to restore him with milke. The Gouernor of the Country hearing of this wonder, calles for HENRY, and enquiers the truth of him: who giuing no credit to HENRYES confession, would see a newe tryall thereof. He therefore caused him to be shut vp, and carefully watcht and kept in a Chamber for the space of fortie daies and forty nights, without any thing to norrish him. The which he did endure without any noyse, and with lesse difficulty then the first, attributing

Hee was tyed to a great stake with a long chaine, and they did fire many fagots round about him, a pretty distance off, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing that hee would runne about this stake, euen vnto the last gaspe. But contrarywise falling vpon his knees and lifting vp his eyes to Heauen, hee made a feruent prayer vnto GOD<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then rising vp, he went couragious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly o the fire, enters into the flames, and sits downe so quietly, as no man could see him moue hand or legge, or any other part of his body, but with-out any stirre or tormenting of himselfe, hee ended his life in the fire. They could not finde any peece of his bones: and many since passing by the place where hee had beene burnt, held it for a place of deuotion.

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Bout the yeare 1503. there liued at <hi>Geneua</hi> a notable theefe called MOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TAC, and in <hi>French</hi> MORTEL. He did inchant men in such sort, as no man could preuent his theeuing, nor punish him after the deed. Euery one knew he was a theefe, and were as warie of him as they could. It was a common watch-word in all the houses of the Towne, when as night came, for Maisters and Mistres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to warne their seruants to shutte the doores for feare of MORTAC, which grew to be an ordinary Prouerbe, when as they doubted any one that had filching fingers. But there was neither doore, lock, nor barre, that could keepe him out, where hee had a will to enter: yet hee went not to all places, but only to those that lookt sower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on him, and seemed to distrust him, for he tooke a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to steale, to be admired for his abilitie and cunning: neither did hee care to gather much together, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented himselfe with a little, taking no more then would serue him for some 40. or 50. meales, with some compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions which he carried vp and downe, feasting them at his charge. And there was no meanes to preuent his wil: for he did so inchant them of the house, as they lost their speech, &amp; all meanes to resist him, making them like im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moueable stocks, when he entred into their houses.

serued him for his Pick-locks: but in thus proceeding he would shew his theeuish authority. Then would he open the Larder &amp; the Seller, from whence hee fetcht meate and wine, couered the Table, and eate and drunke at his leasure and pleasure, and yet not any one of the house did stirre, eyther to hinder him, or to accompany him, neither to crye out, nor yet to speake vnto him, eyther good or bad. This done, he went and opened the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans cofers, and tooke what money hee thought good, to make good cheere with his Mignions, for 3. weekes or a moneths space in some Tauerne. The next day hee and his band would campe where was best wine: and the Tauerne keepers entertained this rable very gratiously. For this MORTAC did no harme in those places where he vsually frequented, and where the maisters did make much of him. After they had made many good meales, when they came to reckon, he neuer brought any money but sayd vnto the Hoste: Goe and fetch thy due in the corner of such a Chamber of thy house, the which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance had not beene frequented a moneth before. The which the Host doing, hee found the iust summe, and not a farthing more or lesse. It was very strange, that the Iudges did not punish him. He was often put in prison, but the Iudges durst not exceed the lawe, the which did forbid them to condemne any one accused, before he had confessed the fact. And this MORTAC was so constant in denying the trueth, as it was impossible to draw any thing from his owne mouth, whether it were that he felt no torments, or that hee did contemne them. for he apprehended no more to be strained with a corde, then to dance, If they gaue him a sharpe strapadoe, hee seemed to endure much, and would crye out: Let mee

There-vpon they asked him, who hath done this, or that: and he mocking them, would repeate this question, saying: Doest thou know who hath done this or that? and then he would adde in scoffing manner, giue me once more the Strappadoe, for the loue of the Ladies, so as they were forced to let him alone. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted infinite thefts, after the manner before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: but hee dyed not so shamefully as he deserued, yet most cruelly, for the plague hauing so seized vpon his throate, as he could not speake, his Mother (who tended him) fearing he would scape and be hanged afterwards, buried him aliue.

O my Lord replyed the other, you say well, but where are such lenders? And so being fallen into a still discourse of selling and lending, in the ende this good Legat sayd, truelie I wilbe the Man, and no other, that will performe what I haue said. The which hee did, for hee lent him money for so long a Terme, as this gentleman married his Daughter to his owne minde, and yet saued his Lande.

Some fewe daies after, three of them which had taken her in the plaine of <hi>Furli,</hi> came into her Chamber, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce her death vnto her, suffring her to recommende her selfe vnto GOD, then they tied a corde about her necke and strangled her, which done, they lay hold on the Chamber maide, who cryed out with open throate, and strangle her also, and in the ende they seize vpon the two young Children, and send them after the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the maide.</p>

The worst was, they did consumate this marriage.

After some daies FABIOS Father feeling himselfe old, commanded his Sonne to take a partie, and to tell him what maiden he desired to haue to Wife.

This sorrowfull Virgin growne madde to see her-self so abused, seemed to disgest this pill quietly, intreating her Gouernesse to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine so much of FABIO that he would bee pleased to come some-times in the weeke to see and comfort her, and so by little and little to burie their passed friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.

But hauing intreated him in any case not to touch her, but to staie vntill the morning, pretending her fore-passed greefe, as soone as this mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable wretch was fallen a sleepe, shee takes his dagger and killes him, then hauing called her gouernesse, shee stabbes her selfe in her presence with the same poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard, and died presently.

The Father and the Mother did all they could deuise to ease him, and then the next daye seeing that he was come something to himselfe, they inquired of him the reason of his aduenture the night past.

            <p>As for those sicke persons that are strooke with a Melancholike humour, whereof I represent many histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in this section, we haue seene and heard spoke of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers kindes.

Some haue feared infinitely least the ground vnder them should open; others that haue represented vnto them-selues nothing but hideous fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasies and death. Some that haue imagined them-selues dead, and would no more eate nor drinke. Some haue thought they haue had Stagges-hornes on theyr heads.

            <p>There was an <hi>Italian</hi> Monke, possest with such a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholike humour, as hee cast himselfe into the Gulfe of <hi>Venice,</hi> and there was lost.

               <pb n="372" facs="tcp:3511:192"/>And therefore we doe alwayes see them sad, amazed terrified like vnto little children which goe in the darke, the fume of this black and melancholike humour, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueylously troubling the seat of the vnderstanding, whence proceedes this amazement. So wise men doe hold, that the humours of the body doe alter our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, whence after doth proceede the change of the actions of the minde: so as the faculties of the mind, do follow the disposition of the body. There hath beene found a melancholike man which hath supposed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to be without a head; to cure him whereof, they haue charged his head with a hat of lead which was such a continuall burthen vnto him, as in the end he was helpt of that imagination. Hee that thought himselfe to bee all of Glasse, was recouered by the approch of a friend of his, who said that hee was yet more brittle, and iesting politikely with him, freede him from his Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination with good wordes. Some haue beene seene who imagining themselues condemned to die, could not bee diuerted from that apprehension, but in seeing of a Pardon counterfetted to that ende, taking the paynes to reade it himselfe for his better assurance. An other saying that hee was dead and in his graue, was rety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from that humour, by the dexteritie of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion who shut himselfe vp with him and eating, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded him to eate, saying that it was vsuall among the dead.</p>
            <p>Some hold their eyes still fixt vppon the ground, and are wonderfully offended to heare any one laugh, finde nothing that is good, fayre nor well done, bee it neere or farre of, imagining still, that they will put them into prison, beate or kill them: they

crye him mercy whom they first met, they kneele down for feare to an Infant, or to a little Dogge: they seeke holes &amp; obscure places: they make Men beleeue that they are bewitched, inchaunted and poysoned. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, this disease is a Tree, whereof we cannot number the branches nor the leaues. I had forgotten to say that there are some which feare and hate their most familier and greatest friends: others that cannot indure any man, and feare nothing so much as to bee seene. Some haue feare of all creatures whatsoeuer; or of some in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular: those which haue beene bitten by madde-Dogges are wonderfully afraid of Water. To conclude howe many particular fantasies and diseases soeuer there be of melancholicke humours, so many sorts of frensies there bee. But it is a generall thing almost in all persons, toucht with any melancholike humour, troubling the braine simplie moued with strange fumes, which proceed from this venemous humour, or augmented by some newe accident as the biting of madde-Dogges, by extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary illusions, or otherwise, to grow fearefull, especially of things which are in no sort to befeared.</p>
            <p>Nowe it remaines, that wee produce some notable Histories of our Times, touching these passions. My in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention in the report of them, is to shewe how much wee ought to feare our owne miseries, to remember ourva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, and to thinke that GOD needes not to seeke far for any rods to scourge vs, seeing that wee carry them in our own bowels, that death is in this vessell of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and that our soules are in miserable captiuitie, if the light of grace &amp; heauenly truth doth not shine incessant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon them.</p>
            <p>In our time a Gentleman fell into such an humour of
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:3511:193"/>
melancholie, as it was not possible in the extremity of his sicknesse to change an opinion he had, that hee was dead: so as if his friends and seruants came to flatter, intreate or presse him to take some nourishment or phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke, he reiected all, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Sixe dayes past without receiuing of any foode, and the seuenth being come (which is mortall to hungry bodyes) his friends deuised a policie to free him of this fantasie. His Chamber beeing artificially made darke, they caused certaine men to enter into it, beeing masked and clothed in white sheetes, tyed vp like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them that are buryed.</p>
            <p>The table was couered with meate; wher-with these masked Men began to fill them-selues, making little noise but with their chappes and drinking hard. The sicke man seeing this sport, demanded what they were, and what they did there? They answered him that they were dead-men, which made good cheere. Howe then saith the sicke Man, doe dead men eate? I, saide they and with a good stomacke. If you will bee of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, you shall see that we speake the truth.

            <p>There are three kindes of sharpe rauings: the one is when as in the extremity of a Feauer the sicke person doth raue, and speake strange things. The other called frenzie, is alwayes accompanied with folly: for although the sicke body, hath respites lesse troublesome at one time then at any other, yet hee hath alwayes his vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing carried away by fantasies. The third is more dangerous, when as the folly hath no respittes: but doth all things furiously and with violence.

she might doe no more harme to her selfe, nor to any other. After some houres, this tempest being some-what appeased, shee fell into a sound sleepe.

where-with he makes them to aduance, and some-times he handles these wretches so roughly, as the markes of his whippe sticke long by them, and puts them that haue beene beaten to great paine. Being vpon the way, behold they are all (as it seemes to them) changed and transformed into Wolues. They are thousands of them together, hauing for their conductor and guide this Whippe-carrier, after whom they marche, imagining that they are become Wolues. Beeing in the open champian Countryes, they fall vppon such troupes of Cattell as they finde, teare them in peeces, and carrye away what they can, committing many other spoiles: but they are not suffered to touche nor to hurt any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable creature. When they approche neere vnto any Riuer, their guide, (say they) deuides the water with his whippe, so as they seeme to open, and to leaue a drye path betwixt both to passe through. At the end of twelue dayes, all the troupe is dispersed, and euery one returnes vnto his house, hauing layde away his Wolues forme, and taken that of Man againe. This transformation (say they) is done after this manner. Those which are transformed fall sodenly to the ground, like vnto them that haue the Falling-sicknesse, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine like dead men, voyde of all feeling. They stirre not from thence, neither goe into any other place, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are they transformed into Wolues, but are like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to dead carcasses: for although you shake them and rowle them vp and downe, yet they make no shewe of life. From thence is sprung an opinion, that the soules taken out the bodyes, enter into these fantosmes or vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, running with the shapes of Wolues: then when the worke enterprized by the Diuell is finished, they
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:3511:201"/>
returne into their bodyes which then recouer life. The <hi>Licanthropes</hi> them-selues confirme this opinion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing that the bodyes doe not leaue their humaine forme, neyther yet receiue that of a Wolfe: but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie that the soules are thrust out of their prisons, and flye into Wolues bodyes, by whom they are carryed for a time. Others haue maintained, that lying in Yrons in a Dungeon, they haue taken the forme of a Wolfe, and haue gone to finde out their companions many dayes iourney off. Beeing examined how they could gette out off a strong and close prison? Why they haue returned, and how they could passe ouer Riuers that were large and deepe? They answered, that no Yrons, walles, nor doores, could hinder their getting out: that they returned by constraint, and that they did flye ouer Riuers, and runne by land.</p>
            <p>Hetherto I haue set downe the wordes of Doctor PEVCER, the which shew, that this transformation of <hi>Licanthropes,</hi> nor that of Sorcerers mentioned by BO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DIN, haue no affinitie with the transmutation of the King of <hi>Babilon,</hi> nor with that of LOTS wife: and that in this <hi>Licanthropia,</hi> there are manifest illusions of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, the which ought not to bee confounded with apparent testimonies of GODS visitation vpon some persons: as the Diuines which haue expounded these Histories, doe shewe more at large.

Let vs speake after them, and serue them as an Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to our <hi>French-men.</hi> It is a question if the venimous humor called <hi>Rage,</hi> the which breeds in so many sortes of creatures, which impart it vnto man, as we knowe, may beginne by man himselfe, and haue inward beginnings, without any accidentall contagion without. Reason makes vs to yeeld to this opinion, seeing that by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of all men, mortall poisons may be engendred with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in man: that rage should not bee excluded out of this ranke, man differing from a Serpent, which spitts poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, no more then from other beastes, which are subiect vnto madnesse. But for that the Ancients for the most part haue held, that no man could growe madde, if hee had not beene toucht without by some other person or Beast that was madde it seemes wee should not lightly stray from their opinions, notwithstanding seeing that experience may resolue this difficulty, I will relate what mine eyes haue seene. A woman sixe and thirty yeares old, troubled with a continuall feuer, called me to helpe her. I found her seized of a pestilent ague, I gaue her
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:3511:202"/>
Physick, so as eleauen daies after shee was cured. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leauen daies after that she was troubled with a greeuious flixe and an ague. I was called, and began to incounter this disease, the which I surmounted within seauen daies after. There remained yet some relikes of a feuer, the which seeking to take away, this woman fell so to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre all Liquors, as not onelie shee lothed all Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call potions and all drinkes for her refection, but shee could not endure that anie one should drinke in her presence. I knewe by this accident alone that shee was toucht with rage, the which did so increase as shee could not endure they should bring any light in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her Chamber: in regard of her feeding, detesting all drinkes and all liquid Physicke. And for that her fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer and the tediousnesse of her disease, would not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer her to maintayne her selfe well with solide meates shee became exceeding feeble; but shee languished seauen dayes after that shee had begunne to reiect all drinke and Liquide notrishment. I found in her no other cause of defect, but onelie this disdaine of drinking and taking that which was Liquid. Neither did shee complaine of any thing, but when they presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it vnto her; then should you see her mooue her selfe, after a strange manner. Except this, it was a verie quiet infirmitie: and asking her if shee had euer beene toucht with the teeth of any madde Dogge, her answere was, that no Dogge had euer toucht her, hauing had none in her house, nor beene in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie where anie was. Hauing enquired of her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if neuer Dogge had toucht her Daughter at anie time in all her life: shee assured mee no. This made mee to doubt, whether one by internall principles,
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:3511:203"/>
and of their owne corruption) might not become madde. For hauing in this infirmity no coniecture of Contagion without, and this feare of drinke and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quide things, beeing not conioyned with the accidents which are accustomed to accompanie them that are bitten with madde Beastes: I did coniecture that this disease grewe from some internall cause, which was not so violent, comming not by the outwards partes, through the byting of some enraged Beaste: if wee will not say that the force therof was quenched by the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoysons that were giuen her in the cure of her pestilent feuer: and by reason of her apparent and great euacuation of badde humours in the <hi>Dissenterie</hi> or fluxe. Besides this experience, I was confirmed by the authoritie of CAELIVS AVRELIANVS, writing that some-times one growes madde with out anie apparent cause: and by the Historie which SORANVS reports, saying that hee had seene an Infant which did abhorre the Nurces brests, without any precedent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion.

Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vnderstood all from him, to knowe his greefe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly, I offer to his mouth at two or three seuerall times, a glasse full of Water. I call my friendes to see and beholde this spectacle; at euery time his heart pantes and swells, hee trembles, hee faintes, and seemes like one that were strangled.

They brought him a glasse and offred him drinke; the which he refused with horror, and offring to force him, his heart fainted: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at all were wonderfully amazed, and much more, when as they did see him foure houres after giuing vp the Ghost, after that hee had beene disquieted with an vne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall and inconstant trembling, hauing cried without ceasing, beene much distempered, and sweate all ouer great droppes but on the extremities which were colde, moreouer in a strange rauing, accompanied with diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish apparitions, as he sayd. <hi>The same Author.</hi>

The which was soone verified, for hauing drinke offred him, hee beganne to torment him-selfe and to faint away: the drinke being carried away, hee presently came againe to him-selfe. He couldnot endure any one to touch him, and if any one approched neere him, hee would crie out. They durst not (howe softly soeuer) wipe his face that sweate.

            <p>There is an other kinde of rage proceeding of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall cause, that is to say, of the byting of madde Beastes, whereof wee must speake some thing, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Histories according to our intention: to descouer our miseries more and more, and to induce vs to flie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoutly to the mercifull protection of almightie GOD.

There was a <hi>Lucquois</hi> merchant, who hauing lien in <hi>England</hi> a long time, and desiring to end his daies amongst his friends, requested them by letters to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide him a house, for that hee meant to see them within six moneths at the farthest. About the same time he parts from <hi>England,</hi> followed by a seruant of his a <hi>French-man,</hi> with al his papers &amp; obligations, and comes to the Citty of <hi>Roan,</hi> where after he had made a little stay, he takes his way for <hi>Paris:</hi> but being on the mountaine neere to <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentueil,</hi> his man, fauored by the raine &amp; foule weather that was at that time, murthered him, and threwe his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy into the vignes. As this was a doing, a blind man came by, led by his dogge, and hearing one grone, asked who it was? whervnto the murtherer answered, that it was a sick man going to ease himself. The blinde man went his way and the seruant with his Maisters money and papers gets him to <hi>Paris</hi> where he takes vp a good round sum vpon
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:3511:214"/>
his Maisters billes &amp; obligations: this merchant is expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at <hi>Luca</hi> a whole yeare togither, and seeing that hee came not, a fellow was dispatched away expresly to seeke him out; comming to London he vnderstood the time of his departure, &amp; that he was bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d for <hi>Roan;</hi> there also in one of the Innes hee was told that about 6. moneths be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a <hi>Lucquois</hi> merchant had lien there, &amp; was gone to <hi>Paris.</hi> After that what enquiry soeuer hee made, hee was neuer the neerer, nor by any meanes could heare any ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of that he sought. Wherepon he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plained to the Court of Parliament at <hi>Roan,</hi> which began to embrace this affaire, commanding the Lieutenant cryminall to make diligent search within the Citty &amp; <hi>Monsieur</hi> BIGOT without. The first thing the Iustice did, was to will one of his officers to enquire vp and downe the towne whither there were any man that within 7. or 8. monthes before had set vp a new shop. The fellow failes not in his charg, but returning saies he met with one, of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hauing lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the name, the iustice supposeth an obligatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wherby this new mercha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t binds himself body &amp; goods to pay the sum of 200. crownes within a certaine time, &amp; by vertue thereof, being wild to pay the money, hee answered that the bond was forged, for he owed no such debt. The Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant taking this answere for a refusall, arrested him. and as they went along togither, the merchant happened to tel him that hee would answere this well enough: but is there no other matter sayd hee? The Sergeant goes and reportes how all had past to the Iustice, who taking hold of those words, whither there were no other matter, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the prisoner to be brought before him: beeing come, he made the roome to be voided, and with gentle speech told him, that hee had sent away the rest, because
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:3511:214"/>
he meant to deale kindly with him: that in truth he had caused him to bee arrested vpon a supposed obligation, but that there was another matter in the winde. For hee knew for certaine, that the murther of the <hi>Luequois</hi> was committed by him, and thereof good proofe was to bee made, how-be-it hee desired not to take any rigorous course: that the dead man was a stranger, altogether without friends, and therefore it was an easie matter to bury all things in obliuion, so that the prisoner would be wise, and do that which was fitting for him-selfe. All this was spoken in such a fashion, as if the Iustice had gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to draw mony from him. Herewith the prisoner so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited partly by the remorse of his conscience, partly by the hope he had to cleere himselfe by a bride, answered the Iudge, that herein appeared the very hand of GOD, seeing there was no other witnesse but himselfe, and yet the matter was come to light, and that vpon the promise which had been made him, he would freely confesse the truth. Thervpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Iudge thinking he had got his desire, sent one for the Register. In the meane time the prisoner perceiuing he had plaid the foole, when the Iudge would haue had him confesse the murther, he began to change his coppy, and maintaine that all this proceeding was ful of slander and falshood. The Iustice being som-what fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated of his hope, sends the Merchant to prison, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of more ample proofe. But hauing had confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with other prisoners, who are craft masters in such affaires, he appeales from his imprisonment, &amp; s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>es both the Sargiant &amp; the Iustice. I leaue you to thinke whether the cause were without apparance of reason. Forgery is obiected against the obligatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; there needs no proofe, for it is confessed. And indeed the Iustice went directly
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:3511:215"/>
to the Parliament, where he discoursed at large how all things had beene carried. The Court being well assured of the honesty of the Iustice, suspended the course of this sute for a time. In the meane space Monsieur BIGOT had incharge, to make enquirie all the way betweene <hi>Rouan</hi> and <hi>Paris,</hi> to see if he could come by any notice of the matter: which hee executed with all diligence. At length passing by <hi>Argentueil,</hi> the Bayliffe tolde him, how not long before, they had found a dead carcasse in the Vines, halfe eaten with Dogs and Crowes. Ther-withall came the blind man a begging to the Inne where BIGOT lay, and vnderstanding the perplexitie they were in, told them all that hee had heard about the same time on the Mountaine. BIGOT asked him, whither he could know the voyce againe? The other answered him, that hee thought he should. Whervpon he set him vp on an horse behind another, &amp; rode away with him to <hi>Rouan,</hi> where being alighted, and hauing giuen an accompt of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, the Court determined to heare what the blinde man could say, and after to confront him with the priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Hee hauing then discoursed at full all that past in his hearing on the Mountaine, &amp; the answer that was retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him, being demanded, whether hee could know the voyce againe? he replied that he did not thinke but hee could. Therwith they shewed him a far of to the prisoner, &amp; asked him, when the blind man was gone, whither he could take any exception against him. GOD knows what a case he was in then. For he said, that there had neuer bin such deuises practised to impeach the innocency of an honest man, as there had bin against him. First the Iustice by vertue of a false obligation to lay him in prison: then to make him beleeue how hee had confessed that which
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:3511:215"/>
neuer did: and last of all, to bring in a blind man for a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes against him, why it was pastal rules of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon sence.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding that, the Court seeing he had nothing els to say against him, caused 20. men &amp; aboue to speake one after another, &amp; still as they spake, the blind man was asked whither he knew their voices, whervnto he replied that it was none of them. At last when the prisoner had spoken, the blind man said, that that was he which answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him on the Mountaine. The same confusion of voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces hauing been two or three times reiterated, the blind man hit alwaies on the right, and neuer missed. Take all the accidents of this processe seuerally, and you shall find many that make for the prisoner. But when you haue thoroughly considered the contrary, there are a number of circumstances which make against him: a new Citti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ze<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which had set vp a new shop a little after the <hi>Lucquois</hi> disapearing, the honesty of the Lieutenant knowne to all men, the deposition by him and the Sergeant made: but especially the miraculous encounter of the blind man, who was both at the murther, as afterward in the Inne where BIGOT lay: &amp; finally that without any fraud he had discerned the murtherers voyce from many others. All these things duely weighed, were cause of the wretched mans condemnation: who before he was executed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed all, to the discharge of the Iudges consciences. E.

            <p>On Christmas eue 1551. a certaine fellow brained a yong woman with an Hammer, hard by Saint <hi>Oportunes</hi> Church in <hi>Paris,</hi> as she was going to mid-night Masse, &amp; tooke away her rings. The Hammer was stolne the same euening from a poore Smith there-by, who therefore suspected of the murther, was very cruelly handled, and
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:3511:216"/>
put to an extraordinary kinde of torture, by reason of the violent presumptions that made against him. In such sort that he was quite lamed, &amp; depriued of the meanes to get his liuing, where-by reduced into extreame pouerty, hee made a miserable end. The murtherer remained almost 20. yeares vnknowne, and the memory of the murther seemed to be buried with the poore woman in her graue. Now marke how it came out at length, though it were long first. IOHN FLAMENG Sergeant of the subsidies at <hi>Paris,</hi> that was afterward chiefe Vsher in the Court of <hi>Aydes,</hi> being one day in the Summer at Saint <hi>Leups,</hi> a vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage by <hi>Montmorency,</hi> whether he was sent to sit vpon a Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mission, chanced among other talke at supper, to say before certaine of the place, how hee had left his wife at home sick, and no body with her but a little boye. There was an old ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> then present named MOVSTIER, &amp; a sonne in-law of his: who immediately vpon this speach went away that night, with each of them a basket of Cherries, and a greene Goose, and came about ten of the clock the next morning to FLAMENGS house: where knocking, the woman looked out at the window, and asked who it was. They answered that her husband had sent her a greene Goose, and a basket or two of Cherries, wherevpon the dore being opened to them by the boye, they clapped it too againe, and cut his throat. The poore childe strugling with them, the woman heard the noyse, and stept out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a gallery ioyning to her Chamber, to see what it was, where perceiuing a streame of bloud in the yarde, one of them told her that it was the bloud of the Goose: In the meane time the other ranne vp the stayres thinking to surprise her. She mistrusting the truth of the matter, got back againe into her Chamber, bolted the doore within
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:3511:216"/>
and cryed out of the windoe for helpe saying there were theeues in her house. The two wretches, seeing they had fayled of there purpose, would haue got away, but going to vnclocke the gate, they brake the key in the locke. So that hauing no meanes to scape, they went to hide them selues. The youngest climbed vp into the funnell of a chimney, the old man co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ueied himselfe into the bottom of a celler. There-with the neighbors came running to the house, &amp; breaking open the dore, found the boy lying dead in the yard, where-vpon they sought vp and downe euery corner for the murtherers; he in the chimney was taken first, and the other after long search was found in the well of the cellar with nothing but his nose aboue water. They were straight way caried to prison, and shortly after arraigned and condemned to death. Being on the scaffold at the place of execution, the old man desired to speake with the Smiths widdowe, of whom mention was made at the beginning. When she came he asked her forgiuenes, and told her it was he that killed the young woman by S. <hi>Oportunes</hi> Church. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of his being committed to record, they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted as they deserued. E. PASQVIER <hi>in the same booke and Chapter.</hi>

            <p>Eleven or twelue Danysh gentlemen being in talke to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither one euening in a <hi>stoue,</hi> fel to some hot words a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themselues, which at length grew to such termes, that the candles sudenly were put out, &amp; one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was stabbed with a poygnard &amp; killed. Amongst those gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen was a Pursiuant of the Kings. Now the murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer was vnknowne, by reason of the nomber, although the gentlemen accused the pursiuant for it, but the King would not beleeue them, saying they had conspyred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:3511:217"/>
his seruant. In this perplexitie the King caused them to come altogether into the <hi>stoue,</hi> and standing round about the dead corps, he commanded that they shold one after another lay there right hand on the slaine gentlemans naked brest, swearing they had not killed him. The Gentlemen did soe, and no signe apeared to witnes against them. The Pursiuant onely remayned who condemned before in his owne conscience, went first of all and kissed the dead Mans feete: but assone as he layd his hand on his brest the blood gushed forth in great abundance, both out of his wound and nosthrills: so that vrged by this euident accusation, he confessed the murther, and by the Kings owne sentence was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continently beheadded. HENRY RANSOVIVS Liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant for the King of <hi>Denmarke</hi> in the duchy of <hi>Holsace</hi> makes this relation in a letter of his that is now in print: &amp; farther addeth, that the King his maister reported this history to him, and to VLRIC his sonne in lawe Duke of MECKELEOVRG with these words: Some of the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen accused of this murther are still liuing, this first day of <hi>Iuly.</hi> 1591. And how that euer since the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Pursiuant, King CHRISTIERNVS 2. Permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that ouer al his Kingdome vnknowne murthers shold be sought out after that manner.</p>
            <p>I will ad another example (saith he) in the same letter written to DAVID CHYTREVS which happened at ITZEHOVV in <hi>Demnarke</hi> in my Fathers time. A Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueller was murthered by the high way side and be-cause the Murtherer could not bee found out, the magis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates of <hi>Itzehow</hi> made the body to be taken vp, and an hand to be cut of, which was caryed into the prison of the towne, and hung vp by a string in one of the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. About ten yeares after, the murtherer comming
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:3511:217"/>
vpon some occasion into the prison, the hand which had bene a long time dry began to droppe blood on the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that stood vnderneath it. The laylor beholding so extradinary a thing stayed the fellowe, and aduerty sed the magistrates of it, who examining him in the presence of my Father, the murtherer giuing glory to God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed the murther which hee had commited so many yeares before, and submitted himselfe to the rigor of the lawe which was inflicted on him as he well deserued.</p>

Now because there was no safer nor nearer way for him then to crosse the lake to <hi>Bonne,</hi> which might very well bee performed in three houres at the most (whereas he should haue beene a day and a halfe going by the bridge of <hi>Chancy</hi> and that with danger) hee went to one of his acquaintance named IOHN VILLAIN of the Village of <hi>Thaney</hi> in the Bayli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wicke of <hi>Nyon,</hi> hard by the towne of <hi>Coppet,</hi> and desired him to helpe him to some that would carry him ouer the lake. VILLAIN went along with him to <hi>Coppet,</hi> where one of the best of the Towne had the Gentleman to a Tauerne, and there it was agreed that two water-men of the place, which were present, should carry him ouer. Wher-vpon he went back to <hi>Thaney</hi> for his horse, appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell and other things. Being returned &amp; in the boat cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the lake, the said water-men, whereof the cheefest was called MARTIN BOVRRY, fell vpon him and cut his throat. VILLAIN vnderstanding it &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaining of so cruell a treachery, was answered, that it was an enemy who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they had dispatched. The murtherer fearing to bee called in question about it, to preuent the matter made a present of the Gentlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s horse which was of great value to a certaine Maister and kept the rest to himselfe. inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that the murther was neuer spoken afterward, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther durst VILLAIN vse many words about it, for feare of him-self. But God would not leaue it so vnpunished. For about the 15. of Iuly 1591. this BOVRRY going with diuers others of <hi>Coppet</hi> to shoot for a wager, as he was charging the harguebuze which he had robbed the Gentleman of when he murthered him, it sodainly discharged of it selfe &amp; shot the murtherer through the heart, so that hee fell

            <p>In the first troubles a Gentleman of the troups which beseeged <hi>Moulins</hi> in <hi>Burbonnois</hi> was taken sicke in such sort that he could not follow his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany when they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodged: and lying at a Bakers house called IOHN MON which professed much friendship and kindnes vnto him, he put such confidence in him, that he stayed behind the rest, hauing shewed his host the money that he had, who promised to defend him from all men, together with a little brother of his some 13. or 14. yeares old. But so far was this wretch from keeping his promise, that contrarily as soone as it was night, he trayned them forth of dores, and most wickedly murthered them. Now marke howe God reuenged it: it happened not long after that the murtherer being in sentinell, one of his fellowes not thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of it, shott him through the arme with an Hargue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buze wherof he languished the space of 3. months, &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> died stark mad. <hi>Historie of France vnder</hi> CHARLES <hi>the</hi> 9.</p>

After Easter the yeare following she refused to drinke, insomuch that in the greatest heate of summer shee neuer dranke: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon it ensued that shee neither voided vrine nor other excrement.

In the same Towne of <hi>Delft</hi> about Maie 1566. being accompanied with a Chirurgion, I visited a certaine sick maide, of 27. yeares of age or thereabout. She had kept her bed euer since she was sixteene yeares old, eating nothing all that time as her keeper affirmed, but once a day a little morcell of drie Cheese: Neither was it possible to make her take any kinde of drinke, and yet she made Water reasonable well, although she went to the stoole but once in eight daies. Moreouer she was borne blinde, and at 20. years of age had the dropsie, but that Water vanishing away, insteed thereof, shee had a noise in her belly like the croaking of a number of liue Frogs, accompanied with a wonderfull heauing and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of her belly, insomuch that doe what I could, my hand layd vpon it was lifted vp a good height.

In the meane time wee will present this which ensueth. On Tuesday the 24 day of Nouember 1584. by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement of the most il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious Prince IOHN CASIMIR County <hi>Palatine</hi> of <hi>Rine,</hi> the gouernor and superintendant of <hi>Caiserlanter,</hi> accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with HENRY SMETIVS and IOHN IAMES Theodore, Doctors of Physick, made enquiry in the village of <hi>Schi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nidweiler</hi> in the iurisdiction of <hi>Colberberg,</hi> touching the Maide whose history we relate.</p>
            <p>KVN TONNELIER borne at <hi>Spisheim,</hi> an honest husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, being examined by those co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>missaries, among other articles affirmed that KATHERINE, at that instant some 27. years of age, Daughter to him and to his Wife like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise named KATHERIN, hauing alwaies had her health, til such time as she began to haue her monethly purgatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, at her returne from a certaine wedding caught an ague, which tooke away all appetite from her to hot meats for the space of fiue years togither, during which time shee felt her selfe well and lusty, did her worke, was very obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to her parents, deuout in praier vnto GOD, well affected to the hearing of his word and throughlie
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:3511:222"/>
instructed therein. Now to bring her to hot meates a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, her father and mother (besides other ordinary me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines) put her into the hands of an Empyrike, who in steed of helping her with a certaine drinke, quite tooke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way her stomach from al meates both hot and cold: inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that till then, namely for the full terme of seauen yeares, no meate nor drinke whatsoeuer went downe the throate of this maide: who for six moneths after the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust onely sucked the Iuice of a fewe peares and apples. But not able to vse this remedy any longer, shee washed her mouth with aqua-uitae, but could not swollow a drop of it. This lauing some-what refreshed her: but being to sharpe, she allaied it with a little faire Water. Her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther added, that all this time he could neuer perceiue any euacuation of vrine or other excrement in the said maide, or swete, or vermine in any parte of her bodie: but alwaies found her bedde cleane, and her body with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out spot or speck of filth: vnlesse it were that some-times shee seemed to bee troubled with a distillation of the braine, which nowe and then made her to spit a little. And many times a certaine vapor rose in her side which fumed vp to the heart, and caused a paine in her head, that made her very faint for the time, but it lasted not long, and that onely against foule weather. The sight or sauor of meates neuer offended her, though shee had no appetite nor desire at all to them. If at any time shee chanced to faint, shee rubbed her temples and stomach with a little sweete Water: which very much comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her. The deposition of the mother and neighbors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed in all pointes heere-with.</p>
            <p>The same KATHERINE visited by the Princes foure Commissaries, was found faire of face, well colloured,
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:3511:222"/>
full of life and good disposition, her eyes cleare, and quick sighted, like one in perfect health, saue that they were some-what sunke into her head, and that vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath them some times rose a tumor which continued not long. Neither had shee any defect in her sences of smelling, hearing, and tasting. Her speach was sweete, significant and intelligible. Only her mouth was growne so straight by reason of her cheekes which very much pained her (as she said her selfe) that she could not put so much as her little finger into it: but yet without appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of swelling. Her haire was all falne off of her head and began to come againe. In this sicknesse or infirmity, she had scarce had any speach or sence for three yeares together. But the Thursday before Easter 1583. she reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered her speech and sences, much better then euer she had had them at any time in her health before, and that after an admirable manner, as followeth.</p>
            <p>Her Father being gone about that time to a Forrest hard by the village for to fell Timber, and her Mother hauing shut all the dores for to go to him, and left their Daughter in the house alone by her selfe: a Man in the habit of a Minister, entred into the <hi>Stoue,</hi> went to the beds side, tooke the Maide by the left arme, lifted her vp, and staying her, made her walke a turne or two: and then asked her if she could pray. KATHERINE some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what amazed with this demand, could not answer him, being speachlesse. Hee began then to rehearse the ten commandements in the vulgar tongue, the Articles of our faith, the Lords Prayer, the institution of Baptisme, and of the holy Supper: exhorting her besides to pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, comforting and assuring her, that her speach should shortly be restored to her againe. Wherevpon he
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:3511:223"/>
suddenly departed from her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and immediatly her speach came to her againe, so that her Mother being returned home, the Maide talked plainly and intelligibly with her, and afterwards with her Father, whereat they were both merueilously abashed. After that time, her speach and sences neuer failed her.</p>
            <p>The report of the Physitions yet farther conteineth this ensuing, which I adde for the content of the Reader. Touching that which concerneth her brest or stomach, she hath a very sweete breath, her pulce is temperate, and as it should be, but before &amp; behind her arme-pits, both aboue and below, she is some-what faint. Her brests are longer, softer, and hanging downe more then commonly Maidens doe. She many times feeles a paine in both her sides, which brings her into such a case, that she can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fetch her breath, but it is quickly gone by the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a little water. One cannot touch the pit of her sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, but it greeues her. As for her belly it hangs some<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what lanke like an empty body: but on the out-side it is in pritty good plight, and is reasonable fat and fleshy: she is neuer troubled with any wind or collick, nor feeles any hickock, stitch, or other paine in her stomach. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though she hath often-times of her owne accord, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out constraint or necessitie, endeuoured to take and swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low downe meate, yet could she neuer doe it, albeit she can abide the sent of meates, and endure that one should eate and drinke by her, but more at some-times then at other-some. For she hath been and still is, as if her throat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boll were quite closed vp, &amp; altogether stopped she goes not to the stoole, nor hath vrine or monethly purgations, which she hath had for a certaine time together perfectly and duely before her infirmity, but now they are cleane
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:3511:223"/>
gone. In like manner, she is neuer a thirst, yet some-times she takes a little faire water &amp; <hi>Aqua vitae</hi> mingled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for to wash her mouth, and spets it out againe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently. The which she was wont to doe with <hi>Aqua vitae</hi> alone, but now she cannot endure it, being too sharpe &amp; strong in her mouth which is very tender, &amp; this she does only for the recreation and comfort of her head &amp; heart. Touching her armes and legs, her armes are sound and fleshy: especially her left arme is nimble &amp; in good case, without any defect. But as for her right arme, it is lame from the elbow to the fingers ends, whereby her hand is growne crooked, so that shee cannot stirre it. Not-with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing shee can moue the said right arme a little vp to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the shoulder, but cannot lift it to her head, nor put it from one side to the other, with-out helpe. Her legges and thighes are some-what full and fleshy, but are so shrunke, that she cannot stretch them forth at length, &amp; yet she can moue her toes and her feet a little. Her sayd arme became lame so, &amp; her legs crooked by lying in her bed three yeares together, without eating any thing. Throughout all her body is a temperate and kindly heat. The nailes of her feete and hands are well formed, long, and in good disposition, like one in perfect health.</p>
            <p>The Physitions hauing made this report, &amp; euery thing well examined and considered: the Commissaries were of opinion for diuers reasons, that 4. women of good dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, and fit for such a businesse, should be chosen and sent to <hi>Schimdweiler</hi> to keepe this Maide by turnes, two by day, and two by night, for the space of a fortnight, to the end no meate nor drinke what-so-euer might be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred to her by any person: &amp; that the bed whereon she lay, should be changed, and another put in the place of it,
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:3511:224"/>
and that diligent search should bee made ouer all the <hi>Stoue.</hi> The Maide her-selfe had declared, that diuers men and women had resorted to her out of the Bishoprick of <hi>Treues,</hi> and questioned her about reuelations and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions. More-ouer there were letters found written to her, as it had beene to an holy Virgin, the intent of the writers being to make an Idoll of her, and to erect a pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage vnto her. Wherefore the Commissaries made report of all before mentioned, to the Gouernor of <hi>Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stad</hi> and the Princes Councell, who shortly after gaue Commission to the Gouernor of <hi>Caiserlauter,</hi> to take or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for this affaire, where-vnto hee obeyed with all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and thereof made his report, which I copied ouer being translated out of Dutch, in the termes ensuing.</p>
            <p>Following your Commission of the 24. of December 1584. directed vnto vs, touching the affaires of the Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of the village of <hi>Schmidweiler,</hi> we haue made diligent inquisition for foure honest women, &amp; it was a long time ere wee could finde any that would employ them-selues in such an affaire, vntill at length we haue therevnto in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced and perswaded ANNE BRENNING, the widow of ANDREVV ZILS late of this towne, other-wise called the old ioyner: ANASTASIA widdow to IOHN EBERARD, in his life time Minister of <hi>Walhalben.</hi> AGNES the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters wife of <hi>Steinwerden:</hi> and MARGARET the wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of IOHN GAVFFEN whilst hee liued Burgesse of this Towne. And after they were thoroughly instructed and informed of their charge, according to the tenor of the aduise which at the beginning was sent to his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and that they had all foure taken their oath, wee sent them on the 16. daye of Ianuary last past, to the sayd place of <hi>Schimdweiler,</hi> with Maister LOLEMAN the
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:3511:224"/>
superintendant, where they remained with the sayde Maide vntill the 8. day of the same moneth: being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned back againe, the next day they discoursed at large vnto vs, all that they had learned, discouered and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented touching this affaire as followeth.</p>
            <p>The said Superintendant being arriued about euening the first day, with the foure women afore mentioned at <hi>Kolberberg,</hi> there they rested that night, and the next day went by Waggon to <hi>Schimdwailer,</hi> where going to the Father and Mother, they gaue them to vnderstand, how by the commandement of the Gouernours they were come thither, with charge to keepe their Daughter for a fortnight together. And that to no other end, but to stop the mouthes of such as on euery side spake ill of their Daughter, and of the Prince likewise, because hee gaue credit to their said Daughters speeches, to wit, that in so long a time she had neither eaten nor drunke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> briefly it was to no other purpose, but that once for all, the world might be assured of the truth. There-vnto the Father and Mother gladly submitted themselues, and with kinde en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine carried the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to their Daughters chamber, where the Superintendant spake in the same manner to the Maide, as they had done before to her Father &amp; Mother, and shewed her at large the occasion of their comming. Where-vpon the Maide began to complaine &amp; demand for what cause they would molest and trouble her so. Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially she seemed to be very much grieued, for that her Father and her Mother should not lye in her Chamber by her as they had accustomed to doe: but incontinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after the departure of the Superintendant, ANNE BREN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NING dealt in such sort with the said Maide, that she wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly agreed to what-soeuer they would, and not onely
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:3511:225"/>
permitted them to carry away the bed where vpon her Father and Mother lay: but also suffered them to visit her owne bed, nay to take it quite away, and make her another in a little <hi>Stoue,</hi> where was no roome for her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Mother to lye. And when in the day time they entred into the Chamber, they came not neere their Daughter, nor talked with her in secret. Now during this fortnight, the foure wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnderstood of them how this Maides sicknesse first began, and how many yeares she had p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ies. Likewise the said women found that the said Maide is at some-times weaker and fainter then at other some, and they haue alwayes watched with her, two by day, and two by night. And for a more exact as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance of the truth, one of the foure lay euery night with the said Maide in her bed, so that by no meanes any fraud could happen, where vnto they alwaies tooke very dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent heed, and watched very carefully both day &amp; night, but neuer could finde any other thing, then as the saide Maide had still before very truely affirmed of her selfe.

            <p>I well fore-see (sayth he) that two sorts of people may be mooued, either with the only subiect of these discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses (touching such as haue liued without eating) or of the proofes thereof. The one is ignorant of naturall Phylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy and Physick, persons to bee reuerenced for their simplicity and piety, as the common people, and al those that apply not their studie to examine the causes of each thing. The other is diabolicall, persecuting that with most impudent stander which they knowe to bee well spoken. I will not stand vpon these, because they attend not the explication of my speech but with their poyson infect and depraue all that is receiued by their impure thoughts: As for the rest, mee thinkes it is conuenient I should satisfie them with all sincerity.

Certainely it were true if we did not acknowledge that it was so giuen against the Lawes of nature to men in perfect health, through a certaine priuiledge, as wee religiously beleeue. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption from the infirmity of the flesh was Diuinely granted to them for a time: insomuch that their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition at this time was other then the condition of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde. But those which as wee learne out of prophane Histories haue liued certaine yeares without eating, if their report bee true, it must needes bee that those per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons were all vnhealthy and full of much cold iuce, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the bodie might be nourished a long time. For by that which dayly happens wee see that many sick folkes haue no appetite, by reason their ventricle is stuft with euill humors, and they receiue lesse meate in a weeke, then they did in a day when they were well. But when a man of a sound bodie can but passe one or two daies without meate: and not bee an hungred, that exceedes the rules of nature, and is a Diuine miracle. Howe much more admirable is it, that such a man should fast fortie daies togither in such manner that hee feeles no hunger, hath no neede to resist the desire of eating, nor hath any more appetite to meate or drinke, then an Angell? Wee beleeue that IESVS CHRIST had a bodie exceeding temperate and pure, though hee were subiect to our infirmities according to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of his humaine natu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Wherevpon it ensueth that they are iustly es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemed for excellent miracles, whereby the authority of those Prophets and of IESVS CHRIST were establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed. Nowe it is no nouelty that the like effects should happen by the order of things which our most good and mighty GOD hath prescribed to nature, and by an eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent miracle against the lawes of the same nature. For feauers and diuers other disseases, which the Saints haue healed, the Physitions doe also cure. But the meanes which they vse, make great difference in the case. For the Saints by their worde or touch alone, through the grace of GOD, tooke away the causes of such effects with the necessity imposed vpon nature. The Physitions do nothing but oppose vnto naturall things other like wise naturall, whereby if the vertue of the remedies giuen by the Creator bee of greatest strength, and that it be his will it should not bee in vaine at that time, the cause which doth offend is defaced.

Where-vpon hee resolued to bee ruled by them. Not long after, the Souldiers and Inhabitants of the place, prouoked by the enemy, made a sallie. GRIMANI remembring his vision, followed them faire and softly aloofe off, onely to behold the fight, and because hee

For feare had so chaunged him, that whereas the day before hee had a Vermillion hewe, of a flaxen hayre, and of a pleasing aspect: hee was now like vnto a bodye taken out off the Graue, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the hayre of his head and beard, like to one of seuentye yeares olde, and hee had the resemblance more of one that had beene hanged, then of a ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing man.</p>
            <p>The Emperor thinking there had bin some fraud vsed, and that some other offender had beene foysted into this Gentlemans place, who was not yet 28. yeares old, hee caused a search to bee made, whence this wonderfull and sodaine change should come. and then beholding wistly this poore offender thus terrefied, the desire of iust vengeance was conuerted and turned into mercye: and as it were reuiued out of a deepe amazement, hee said vnto him. <hi>I pardon thy offence;</hi> commanding that they should let him goe, adding withall that hee had beene punished sufficiently for his fault, without the losse of his head.

it to the deepe apprehension and attentiue thought of approching death, peercing through the heart: for the affection and passion of the minde, beeing amazed was so violent and so bitter to the young Gentleman, as the vitall spirits were almost quencht and suffocated in him, all the parts of the bodye loosing their liuely and pleasing colour, did wither and fade sodainely; so as the rootes of the hayre, nourished and watred by the fuming vapour that is betwivt the skinne and the flesh, as the herbes in the ground, that are toucht with a cold and drie quality, they did wither, and present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loose their naturall beautye: for euen as the leaues of Trees and Vines in the heate of Sommer growe some times y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The which wee doe see happen to most men that haue beene in dangers in the Warres, or in hazard at Sea, or that haue beene toucht with dangerous diseases: for then they thinke but of one thing, which is, that Death hath taken them by the throat, if not perchance (through long custome, solide instruction and good resolution by the precepts of true Philosophie, and by the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance of more then a humane spirit) they bee not accustomed nor vsed to feare so much.

one, or that the imagination thereof, more bitter then death it selfe is framed in the thought, they die some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times before they are dying, as it hath happened vnto many, or else the Senses are dulled and mortefied, so as the offenders feele not the stroakes, as we haue seene in many that haue beene be-headed, and broken vppon the Wheele, resembling men that haue Apoplexies, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargies, falling-Sicknes, Sowndings; or like to others which open their eyes, yet neither see nor knowe any man. The dangers incident to Sea and Land, whereas the Image of Death appeares before their eyes, and doth fixe it selfe more strongely in the thought, make them that are in them to tremble and looke pale: the blood retires it selfe and flies from all parts towards the fortresse of the heart: all the parts of the body in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant want their norishment, not any one doth discharge his due function, but the feete stagger, the sight growes dymme, the force fayles, the vnderstanding becomes blunt, the spirit dull, the cheekes leane and withered, the tongue fumbling, and the teeth shaking in the head. To conclude there is no man, how strong and confident so euer, that is not amazed when any mortall danger sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priseth him sodainely.</p>
            <p>True it is that a Christian fixing his hope in the grace of GOD, recouers his spirits by little and little, shakes of feare, assures himselfe, and becomes inuincible, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing him-selfe with a cheereful and vndaunted cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to any danger that hee sees ineuitable: except that that for death is horrible and fearefull to al Nature which hath breathing of life: for that it destroyes this nature.

Hee dined at my Table soberly and modestly. Then going downe into the Court, he returned soone againe: hauing taken vp a great Stone, hee strooke him selfe such blowes vpon the naked brest, as they had beene able to haue killed an Oxe.

<pb n="502" facs="tcp:3511:257"/>
hauing made an obeysance vnto mee, and receiued a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, hee departed. My seruants beeing amazed at this sight, one of them thinking him-selfe more suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient then his companions, began to saye vnto them. Poore fooles why doe you wonder? doe you thinke that this counterfet hath put the fire in his mouth indeed? They bee Impostures and iugling trickes. And in say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so, hee layde holde of the Yron by the verye ende which was out of the fire, to shew that it might be han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled without any hurt or burning. But hee had no sooner gript it in his hand, but hee shakt it off as spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily: but not with such ease: for the space of many dayes, hee had the palme of his hand and fingers so pittifully burnt with the fire, as hee had much paine to heale it.</p>
            <p>His companions could not conteine them-selues from laughing, asking him, if hee did not beleeue that a flaming fire was whotte? adding, That hee might if hee pleased, make a second tryall to confound them whome hee had so mocked: But hee would no more meddle with it. At dinner, this <hi>Turke</hi> who sayde he was a Monke, reported vnto mee, that his Abbot, a holy and famous man for his miracles, was accustomed to cast his cloake vpon a Lake neere vnto the Couent, and then did sit vpon it, and did sport himselfe as easily vpon the water in this sort, as if hee had beene rowing in a faire and calme day in a Boate. That when as they did flea a Sheepe, the manner was to sowe vp this Abbot in the skinne, so as the fore-feete were fitted to his armes, and the hinder to his thighes: and in this equipage they did cast him into a burning Ouen, where hee remained vntill the Sheepe was roasted, then they drew him out of the

Furnaise whole and sound, to eate his part of the Mutton merely with his Monkes. If you will say vnto mee, that such miracles of Sathan, are Impostures where-vnto you giue no credit, no more doe I. I tell you but what the Monke reported: but as for the burning Yron, I did see it with mine owne eyes: the which is not so admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as you would thinke at the first: for I doubt not but this counterfet worker of miracles, going to seeke a stone in the Court-yard to beate his brest withall, might an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint his mouth with some-thing that was fitte to resist the violence of the fire, as you know there is.

Being set vpon a seate equalling the heigth of the table whereon they set the meate, hee tooke a knife with his feete, and began to cut both bread and meate, carrying it vnto his mouth, and a goblet also, as easilie with his feete as an other doth with his handes. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dinner hee beganne to write both <hi>Italien</hi> hand and <hi>Dutch,</hi> so right and so well, as euerie one of vs desired to haue of it, to keepe for a singularity. At my request hee tooke a pen-knife and made good pennes to write, and presented them to mee and to others. Beeing thus busied, I did carefully consider the fashion of his feete and did finde this toes were sum-thing long, fit to laie hold of anything, and a farre off, they resembled the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of a mans hand: as for his legges hee kept them couered with his cloake.

Not long since there was a man seene at <hi>Paris,</hi> without armes, beeing fortie yeares olde, stronge and lustie, who did in a manner all the actions that an other might doe with his hands: with the stumpe of his shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and his head, hee would strike a hatchet as strongely, as an other man could do with his armes. More-ouer hee would lash a Carters whippe, and did manie other actions with his feete: hee did eate, drinke, plaied at cardes and dice: in the ende hee was a theefe and a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer, and was put to death in <hi>Gelderland.

When as the Preacher in his Sermon makes mention of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our IESVS CHRIST, the young man before anie other puts his hand to his hat, and bends his knee with great reuerence.

            <p>The Earle of <hi>Beneuent</hi> had a foote-man, to whome a certaine man came, saying that hee was his Brother, and that being young, hee had left his parents. They were so like, as no man could well descerne them, but that hee which came last, seemed to bee some-what elder then the other. And although the foote-man were called by him to goe and receiue his part of a certaine inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, yet he sayd alwaies to the other, I knowe you not, I am not of your Countrie: swearing that hee was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing a kinne to him.

him as his Brother: so as in the ende the Earle comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them to goe togither to a certaine ancient Woman who sayd shee was their mother. The footeman went thether, beeing there, notwithstanding anie thing that he could alleage, hee could not put it out of this Womans head, but he was her owne Sonne. More-ouer to moue him the more, shee sayd vnto him, if you bee my Sonne, you should haue a marke on such a foote, and in such a place, which was burnt when you were young. The foote-man wondring thereat, confessed it to bee true. Yet he denied it still that hee was her Sonne: protesting that hee had neuer beene in that place, as it was true: for it was iustefied that he differed in nature from those peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and it was certainely knowne who were his parents. <hi>The same Author.</hi>

There were two Daughters so like, as turning but the eye you could not distinguish the one from the other. These young maidens were thirteene or foureteene yeares old: and hauing demanded of the Mother which of them was the elder, shee shewed me the one, saying that shee was halfe an houre elder then the other, for that they were both of one birth, and that with them there came a Son also into the world, who liued with an vncle of his in SE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GOVIA.

They were both learned, affecting to follow great men, and to deale in affaires. They playde both of the Lute, Song their parts, and did write one like vnto another, the sound of their voyce, words gesture, going and all their actions were so like, as their Father, Mother, and Brethren were deceiued to shewe the difference. IHON WILLEMIN, a learned man, hath confest vnto me, that liuing vsually with these two Bretheren, and talking in a manner hourely vnto them, yet he could not distinguish them, so as thinking to impart some secret vnto the one, hee found afterwards that it was the other: so as it was a reuiuing of SOSIAS in PLAVTVS AM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHITRIO.

There are in the Cittie, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbes and Castell, fiue thousand fiue hundred Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, all in a manner like vnto Chappels: many beeing made with great Trees, one layde vpon the toppe of another. And they had high Towers with-out eyther Yron or Stone, very fine and artificially made. The great Dukes lodging is also of Wood: the which hee holds farre more healthfull, then if it were of harde Stone. The Castell is reasonably strong of Walles and

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gone from the <hi>Narue,</hi> about the 10. of Iuly 1570. I arriued at <hi>Moscow</hi> about the beginning of August, where I found the great Duke and his people busied to search out some 30. persons, all which dyed by the Hangmans Sword, onely one was cast aliue into boyling water, for that they had receiued presents and money. Most of them were great Noble-men, and very familiar with the Duke. The rest were Marchants of <hi>Nowgart,</hi> with their Wiues, Children and Families, beeing accused of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in fauour of the King of <hi>Poland.</hi> Within fewe dayes after, a horrible plague entred the Cittie of <hi>Moscow,</hi> and the Countrie about it, with such vyolence, as in lesse then foure moneths there dyed aboue two hundred and fiftie thousand persons. And it was particularly obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that in eyght dayes, from the tenth to the eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of August, there dyed 2703. Priests, and this Plague continued so strangely, as in the ende euery man did wonder, if hee mette with any one of his acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance as then aliue.</p>
            <p>This extreame misery was followed the yeare after with a strange ruine, the 15. of May. The occasion was, that the Emperour of the <hi>Tartares</hi> beeing malcontent, that the <hi>Muscouite</hi> payd him no more a certaine annuall Tribute, and hearing on the other-side, that the great Duke by his tyrannies and murthers, had so wasted his Countries, as they could make no great resistance on
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:3511:273"/>
that side, hee did sommon him to paye his Tribute. But the great Duke answered him with reprochefull spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and scornes. Where-vpon the <hi>Tartar</hi> left his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie about the end of February, hauing an Armie of a hundred thousand Horse, who in two moneths and a halfe, marched almost fiue hundred <hi>Germaine</hi> Leagues. Being within two dayes iourney of the Dukes frontiers, hee resolued to meete them, giuing them Battaile, but he lost it, with a horrible route and slaughter of his men. The Duke knowing that the <hi>Tartar</hi> would seeke after him, fledde with great speed as farre off as hee could. Hee was but nine Leagues from <hi>Moscow,</hi> when as the <hi>Tartares</hi> came to inuest the Towne, thinking him to bee there. They fiered all the Villages about, and seeing that the Warre would prooue too long for them, they resolued to burne this great Cittie, or at the least the Suburbes thereof. Hauing to that end disposed of their troupes round about, they set fire of all parts, so as it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a circle on fire. Then did there rise so vyolent a winde, as in an instant the Towne was fired. This fire was so sodaine, as no man had any leisure to saue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, but where hee was at that very instant. The num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them that were burnt in this fire, came to aboue two hundred thousand: the which happened for that their Houses were all of Wood, and the pauementin the Streetes was of great Sappin Trees, the which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Oylie, made the fire the more violent, so as in foure houres space, the Towne and Suburbes were quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed. I and a young-man of <hi>Rochell,</hi> my Interpretor, were in the middest of the fire, in a ware-house all vaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of Stone, wonderfully strong, the Walles beeing three foote and a halfe thicke, and had vent but of two
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:3511:273"/>
sides: one by the which they went in and out, the which was a good long entrie, and had three Yron doores, distant some sixe foote one from an other. On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side, there was a window, hauing three Yron dores one halfe a foote from an other, which vents wee did stoppe on the in-side, as well as wee could <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet there came in so great a smoake, as it had beene sufficient to haue smothered vs, if wee had not had a little Beere, where-with wee did some-times refresh our selues. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie Noble-men and Gentle-men were smothered in Caues, whether they retyred them-selues, for their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses beeing made of great Trees, comming to sincke so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, smothered them all. Others beeing consumed to Ashes, stopt all vent: so as for want of ayre, those that were shutte in perished. The poore Country-men twentye miles about, who had saued them-selues there with their Cattell, seeing the fire, retyred them-selues into a great voyde place in the Cittie, which was not paued with Wood as the rest were, yet they were all so roasted there, as one of the tallest men seemed but a Childe, the heate of the fire had so shrunke them vp: and that by reason of great houses that were about it. They were the most hideous and fearefull things to see that could bee imagined. In many parts of that place, men lay vpon heapes aboue halfe a Pike thick: the which did wonderfully amaze mee, not beeing able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend how they should bee heapt so one vppon an other.</p>
            <p>This horrible fire made most part of the battlements of the walles to fall, and splitted all the ordinance that lay vpon the walles, which were made of Bricke after the Anticke fashion, with-out any Rampars or Ditche
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:3511:274"/>
about it. Many hauing saued themselues about the walles, were notwithstanding roasted among others; there were manie <hi>Italiens</hi> and <hi>Wallons</hi> of my acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Whilest the fire continued, it seemed to vs that a Million of Cannons thundred togither, and we drempt of nothing but of death, thinking that the fire would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue some daies: by reason of the great circuit of the Cittie, Cas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ell and Suburbes: But all this was consumed in lesse then foure houres: at the ende whereof the noise ceasing, wee had a desire to see if the <hi>Tartares</hi> were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, of whome wee had no lesse feare then of the fire. They bee people made for the Warre, and yet they eate nothing but rootes or some such substance, and drinke nothing but water; and the greatest Lords among them liue vpon no thing but vpon flesh that is sodden betwixt the horse-backe and the saddle wherein hee rides; yet they are stronge men, apt to endure paine and so are their horses, which runne wonderfull swiftly, and goe more ground in one daie feeding but vpon grasse, then ours will doe in three, though they haue store of oates. And therefore the Tartares come easily from farre to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayle the <hi>Muscouits.</hi> but they come onelie in Sommer, for the commoditie of their horses. Their Countrie is temperate, from whence they depart in the ende of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary to bee in <hi>Moscouie</hi> in the beginning of Iune, and they returne in the ende of it into their Countrie, least they should bee surprized with Winter in <hi>Russia:</hi> the which happening, they should all die of hunger, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the desartes conteyning aboue 300. <hi>Germaine</hi> Leagues not inhabited, and therefore without all releefe of victuells, and their horses also hauing no grasse; so as they are forced to make this voiage. Which is aboue
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:3511:274"/>
1200. <hi>Germaine</hi> Leagues, in foure or fiue monethes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all their armie, the which doth commonly consist of a 150. or 200. thousand horse: but their horse-men are ill armed, carrying no other armes but a shirt of maile, with a Iauelin, and a bowe and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>rowes: they knowe not what artillery nor Harguebuzes meanes: hauing but two Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties whereas their Emperor keepes his Court, without any other Townes, villages or houses: but they content them-selues to liue in Tentes which they remooue from place to place.</p>
            <p>To returne to our miserie, hauing listened a little, we might heare some <hi>Muscouits</hi> running vp and downe through the smoake, who talked of muring vp the portes to keepe out the <hi>Tartares,</hi> who staied vntil the fire were al quencht. I and my Interpreter, going out of the ware<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house, found the ashes so hot, as we durst scarse goe, but necessitie forcing vs, wee did runne to the cheefe port, where wee found fiue and twenty or thirtie men that had escaped the fire: with whome in a short time wee did mure vp that port and the rest, and kept watch all night with some hargubuzes that were preserued in the fire. In the morning seeing that the Cittie was not to be held by so fewe men as we were, wee sought some meanes to enter into the Castell, the entrie whereof was then in a manner inaccessible. Hee that commanded there was very glad to heare our Intentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; called vnto vs that we should be very welcome. But there was great difficulty to enter by reason of the Bridges that were burnt, so as wee were forced to climbe ouer Walles, hauing heigh Sappin Trees for Ladders which they had cast out vnto vs, in the which they had cut notches to keepe vs from slyding, Wee did climbe vp with great difficultie, for
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:3511:275"/>
besides the apparent danger of those vneasie Ladders, wee carried about vs the summe of 4000. Dallers, and some pretious stones: the which did trouble vs much to climbe vp theese trees, and that which did increase our feare was, that before our eyes wee did see some of our companions, (hauing nothing but their bodies to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue,) rowle downe from the top of these trees into the ditch full of bodies that were burnt: and wee could not goe but vpon dead bodies, the heapes whereof were so thick in euery place as we were forced to go ouer them, as if they had beene hills to mount vpon: and that which did much trouble vs, going vpon them, armes and legges did breake, the members of these poore Creatures, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing calcined and dried vp through the heate of fire. Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thus into these miserable carcases, the bloud and filth did bound vpon vs. The which caused such a stench through out the whole Cittie, as it was impossible to remaine there.</p>
            <p>The 25. of May at night, as wee did attend in great perplexity what the <hi>Tartares</hi> would attempt against vs, who were 400. or there abouts within the Castell, the <hi>Tartares</hi> (whom we had saluted with our shot, and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne some of them that had approched to neere one of the Castell gates) beganne to turne head the way by the which they came, with such speede as the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning all this storme was past for the which hauing prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed GOD, and giuen order for our affaires, as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent calamity would permit, wee departed from this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solate Countrie.</p>

<pb n="543" facs="tcp:3511:277"/>
her selfe, as all did reuerence, respect and esteeme her, no lesse then one of the Apostells of our Sauiour IESVS CHRIST, for that shee did as it were miraculously cure the Children of many honorable families, making crooke-backes straight, setting legges and thighes that were broken sodenly, not by art nor by any medycines: but by words, inioyning some particular deuotion as a fast of three daies with bread and water: to say the Lordes praier thrice: to goe in pilgrimage to our Ladie of <hi>Ardembourg,</hi> or to Saint ARNOVL of <hi>Audenbourg,</hi> or to Saint IOSSE: or to Saint HVBERT in the Forest of <hi>Ardennes:</hi> or to cause a Masse or two to be song eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie daie, and to assist at them deuoute'y, or to cause some praiers or smal suffrages to be sayd at their charge. These deuotions dulie performed, with in fewe daies after the diseased were cured, through the hope which they and their friends had in this woman. Her carriage &amp; miracles being published through the Country: the Councellors and Iudges (whose Iudgements were perfect, and did see more cleerely then the popular) caused this woman to be apprehended in the night, &amp; carried to prison, but not very straightly kept, where the next day she was exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, how, by what means, by vertue of what alliance, &amp; with what co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidency, she did those cuers? She alwaies an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered confidently, that she had done all with a good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and deuotion, for holie respects, and therefore they ought not to imprison her so ignominiously. Yet the Councel mooued by certaine &amp; apparent presumptions, appointed that she shold be tortured: being brought vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the rack and mildly exhorted to confesse the truth; she persisted still in the negatiue, with an assured counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance: mayntayning, that shee had done nothing
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:3511:278"/>
but by Lawefull meanes, and without conference with any euil spirit. There was present at her examination the Bourgomaster of <hi>Bruges,</hi> a man much afflicted with the goute, by reason whereof during her examination, he did some-times groone and crie out like a man that had beene rackt. The olde woman turning to him, sayd, Maister Bourgomaster will you be quite freed from this torment of the goute. If you please, I will cure you, and that soone. Is it possible (sayd the Bourgomaster). I would willingly giue two thousand Crownes to haue ease, I will giue it thee if thou canst performe what thou saiest. Then the Councellors and Officers that were present sayd vnto him. Sir beware what you say and promise. Beleeue vs (and sending this Witch into her Chamber) and heare quietly what we will say vnto you. The woman beeing carried away, they added. See in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to what daunger you are brought, through a vaine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion, that this woman, like vnto the Apostles, can by Lawfull meanes cure your goute. In outward shewe, all that she doth seemeth holie and diuine, but if you looke narrolie into her actions, there is a great difference. Let her be called againe, and demanded howe she pretends to cure you: if she promiseth to helpe you miraculously as the Apostles did diseases in their time, and that shee followeth the course which they did, we will not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict her, knowing that GODS arme is not shortned. If she vseth vnlawfull meanes, and relies vpon them, both shee and all her inuentions ought rightly to be suspected. Being therefore called backe againe, one of these Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors askt her: If thou presumest to cure the Bourgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master of his gout, what meanes and remedies will thou applie, no other (sayth shee) but that the Bourgomaster
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:3511:278"/>
beleeue for certaine, that I haue power to cure him: hee shall then be whole and sound of his feete. Hauing spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken these words, shee was sent back vnto her Chamber. Then the Councellors with one voyce and consent said vnto the Bourgomaister and to the Assistance. You may vnderstand by the answer of this Woman, that she doth nothing but by the power of Sathan, &amp; that she doth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-take to cure the Bourgomaster by vnlawfull meanes: for in her healing she doth not imitate the holy Apostles, who did cure diseases by faith and the power of GOD. saying vnto the Lame; <hi>In the name of our Lord</hi> IESVS CHRIST <hi>rise vp and walke.</hi> And to the blinde; <hi>In the name of our Lord</hi> IESVS CHRIST <hi>receiue thy sight:</hi> the one recouered his legges, and the other his sight, not by any humaine helpe, but by the Diuine power, in the name and faith of IESVS CHRIST. But this Witch doth brag to cure him, so as the patient trust in her, and beleeue that she can do it. This faith (or misbeleefe) is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contrary to the Apostles faith. This answer duly waighed and considered of; the Bourgomaister being sorry for that which he had said, would not commit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to the olde Woman, but was ashamed of his light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. To returne vnto the Witch, for that she did persist in the negatiue of the offences where-with she was char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with apparent presumptions of truth: it was decreed againe, that she should be put to the Racke: where being roughly handled, shee made confession of some light faults. As for Sorcerie and Witch-craft, shee denied it confidently. Shee was therefore let loose and shutte in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her Chamber. A while after beeing charged againe vpon new presumptions, shee was drawne to the Rack, where shee confessed certaine light faults, as shee had
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:3511:279"/>
done before. But feeling her selfe tormented, shee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to crye out and say; Take mee from hence, else I shall poyson you all with the stincke of my excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the which I can no longer holde. There were harde by certaine Vaultes or Priuies, whether some of the assistance were of opinion they should suffer her to goe. Others that were better aduised, would by no meanes haue her let loose, least there should fall out some new difficultie worse then the former. But by the pluralitie of voyces shee was vnbound, and ledde where shee pretended to goe, where shee stayed aboue halfe an houre, without returning, not-with standing that shee had beene called twise or thrise: In the ende shee was forced to come from thence, to bee layde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine vpon the Racke, the which they began to straine more then before. Shee with-out any lamenting or crying out as shee did before, began to laugh, and knoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with her fingers, shee began at the Iustice, saying. You my Maisters, and thou wicked Hang-man, doe what you will, your crueltie cannot preuaile against mee. Most of the assistants thought that the Diuell had made her impassible. For that shee would not aduowe any thing of that where-with shee was charged by new informations: but beeing stretcht out vppon the Rack, shee did eyther laughe or sleepe. So as beeing vnbound, shee was carryed againe to her accustomed place. Afterward some other witnesses were heard, and newe proofes allowed: Wherevpon it was ordeyned, that shee should bee the third time tortured. But before shee was layde vpon the Racke, wee caused her to bee powled, and all her hayre to bee shauen: then was shee layde vppn the Racke againe, and tortured verye
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:3511:279"/>
sore. Continuing still thus obstinate, some of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie remembred, that they had not shauen the hayre vnder her Arme-pittes, and in some other places which I name not. They called certaine Women, who laying hand on her, found little scrowles of Parchment thrust into her priuie partes, conteyning certaine names of euill spirites, and some Crosses betwixt both. These scrowles beeing deliuered vnto the Iustice, were the cause that shee was stretcht againe vppon the Racke, where-as then shee beganne to crye at the first pull, and to confesse euery pointe of that where-with shee was charged by three Informations.</p>
            <p>Beeing demanded the cause of her obstinate perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance in her former denialls, shee sayde, that if they had not shauen away all her hayre, and depriued her of those breuets, the trueth had neuer come out of her mouth, for that the force of the euill spirit was such, as with the helpe of her haire, and those billets shee was impassible, as it appeared. Some condemned her to bee burnt aliue, others for the most part to doe a rigorous penance publicklye, and then to bee banished for euer, vppon paine of burning. According to this last ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise and counsell, shee was set vppon a Scaffolde, and a false Periwigge made for her, the which was taken from her head by the Hang-man, and cast into a great fire made to that ende: and shee was ledde by two Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators and the Aduocate of <hi>Bruges,</hi> out of the Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie. So shee retyred out of the Countrie of <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> into <hi>Zeland,</hi> remaining some certaine weekes at <hi>Middelbourgh,</hi> where shee returned presentlye to her first trade. FLORENT DAM, Iudge of the Towne was aduertised presently by vs, of all the cause that had
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:3511:280"/>
past in the processe of this woman; and in fauour of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, there was sent vnto him a coppie of the Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, of her confession vpon the Racke and of the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that was giuen against her. By meanes whereof he had a watche ouer her, and discouering by diuerse ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent presumptions, that shee did continue in her diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish sorceries, caused her to bee apprehended and put in prison, who hauing straightly examined her by her vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary confession, and according to the former Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he condemned her to be burnt, the which was exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted. Then he sent Letters of aduice to the Councell of <hi>Bruges,</hi> of all that had past, &amp; by mouth made a large dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to DAMHOVDERE, from whom we had this relation.

            <p>About the yeare 1545. there was discouered at <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doa,</hi> a very famous and renowmed Towne in <hi>Anda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousia</hi> in <hi>Spaine,</hi> that which followeth. A Childe of a poore familye called MAGDELINE <hi>de la Croix,</hi> of the age of fiue yeares, was put by the Parents or Tutors into a Couent of Nunnes. It is not knowne whether it were for deuotion or for pouertie. Beeing thus young, and ignorant as yet what euill was, they say not-with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing (so inscrutable are the Iudgements of GOD) that the Diuell appeared vnto her, in the forme of a blacke and hideous Moore. Although at the first sight shee were greatly terrified, yet this enemie did so flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter her, and did promise her so many pretty workes where-in Children take delight, as shee did accustome her selfe to talke familiarly with him, but alwaies inioyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her, that she (who was fearefull) should discouer no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of this association. In this time the child seemed to
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:3511:280"/>
haue a wonderfull witte, quicke, and differing in disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from others: so as shee was much esteemed of the ancient Nunnes, and of other young Maides. Beeing come to the age of 12. yeares or there-abouts, shee was sollicited by the Diuell to marry her-selfe vnto him: and for her dowrie he promised her to worke so, as for thirty yeares or there abouts, shee should liue in such opinion of Holynesse through-out all <hi>Spaine,</hi> as there had neuer beene the like. Whilest that MAGDELEINE (vnder the opinion of this contract) spent the time in her Chamber with this vncleane spirit, who entertained her by his illusions: An other Diuell tooke the forme and resemblance of MAGDELEINE, &amp; was in the Church, in the Cloyster, and in all the assemblies of Nunnes, with great shew of deuotion. Besides after that hee had done MAGDELEINS seruice in the Church, he let her vnderstand all that was done in the world, whereof gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing aduertisment to those that had her already in great reputation, shee was esteemed to bee a Holy Virgin, and began to haue the name of a Prophetesse. By reason whereof, (although shee were not yet of full age) shee was chosen Abbesse by a general consent of the Monkes and all the Nunnes. When as the Nunnes receiued the Sacrament on dayes accustomed among them, the Priest did alwayes cry out, that they had taken away one of his Ostes, the which was carryed by the aboue-named Angell to MAGDELEINE, who was in the middest of her Sisters, the which she put into her mouth, &amp; shewed as a great miracle. They say moreouer, that if by chance MAGDELINE was not present when Masse was sayde, although there were a Wall betwixt them, yet when the Priest did lift vp the <hi>Corpus Domini,</hi> this Wall did
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:3511:281"/>
riue in two, that MAGDELINE might see it, and eate it afterwards. It is also a notorious thing, that if in any sollemne Feast-day, the Nunnes did lead her in processi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to make the acte more reuerent by some extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie wonder, shee was raised from the ground in the presence of them all, aboue three Cubittes high. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times shee carryed a little Image of IESVS CHRIST, new borne and naked, and in weeping (for shee could powre out aboundance of teares when shee pleased) her haire grewe downe to her heeles, where-with shee couered the Image: then sodenly her haire appeared in their first length. Shee did many such other illusions, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially on sollemne dayes, to make all more admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: These were her principall miracles.</p>
            <p>In the meane time, the Pope, the Emperour, and the great men of <hi>Spaine</hi> did write vnto her: and by their Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters did beseeche her, to haue them and their affaires in recommendation in her prayers: yea they asked her aduise in matters of very great importance: as it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by Letters that were found afterwards in her Clos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set. More-ouer, there were many Ladyes and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women which did not swadle their Children new borne, before the Abbesse MAGDELINE had with her holye hands toucht and blest the swadling bands: in like sort, all the Nunnes of <hi>Spaine</hi> were wonderfully well pleased to haue such a Mother, to whome they did attribute a good part of the holynesse of their Orders. In the end GOD would haue this fraude of Sathan layde open. For MAGDELINE after that shee had spent about thirtie yeares in this acquaintance with the Diuell, and beene Abbesse twelue yeares, shee began to growe wearie of her passed life. There-fore after that she had detested
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:3511:281"/>
these Diuilish Artes, and the horrible society of Sathan, shee discouered freely (and when as they least dreamt of it) this notable wickednesse, vnto the Visiters of the Order. Some <hi>Spaniards</hi> of credit and very learned, haue reported vnto mee, that MAGDELINE knowing that the Nunnes had discouered her fraude: and that (fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to bee accused,) shee had preuented them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing her offence first: for that the custome of <hi>Spaine</hi> is, that if any one did freely confesse an offence, which deserued a gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>euous punishment, hee was pardoned. Euery one was amazed at this confession, the newes thereof was so strange, and they were of opinion to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire more curiously of this matter. To proceede more lawfully therein, and with better order: MAGDELINE was imprisoned in the Couent where she was Abbesse: where beeing examined, shee confest all: and yet the Moore continued his illusions still, for whilest shee was in prison watcht narrowly by men that were at the dore of the prison, and that they did examine her cause: the Nunnes beeing gone into the Church at midnight to sing Mattins; MAGDELINES fantosme came and sat in the Chaire in the Quier, after the accustomed man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and was seene vppon her knees, as it were pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and attending the other Nunnes: so as euery one thought verely it had beene their Abbesse, and that the Visiters had suffered her to come vnto the mid-night Mattins, for the great testimonies shee gaue of her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. But the next daye following, the Nunnes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding that MAGDELINE came not out of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, reported vnto the Visitors what they had seene the night before. They hauing well examined the matter, found that MAGDELINE went not out of prison.

            <p>I will tell you what I haue seene, beeing at <hi>Calaris</hi> a Towne in the Iland of <hi>Sardinia,</hi> whereas then they tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of the arraignment of certaine Witches, who (they sayd) had had conference with them of <hi>France</hi> and of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> which had beene sought out and punnished not long before. A very faire Gentlewoman, about seauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene or eighteene yeares of age, being inticed by one of these Witches, came to haue conference with a Diuill, who came some-time to see her, in the shape of a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man: by meanes whereof he deceiued her, and had his pleasure on her, shee beeing fallen greatly in Loue with him. Hauing entertayned her some-time, they desco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer that she was a Witch: and although shee were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uicted, yet could they not get her to confesse her faults, but contynuing obstinate, she beleeued confidently that the Diuill would saue her, as he had promised, and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with the affection which she bare him, she spake many things which did terrefie them that heard her, To conclude, shee suffred her-selfe to bee put aliue into the fire, calling still vpon this Diuill, and so perished misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.

            <p>An other Gentlewoman, rich, faire and of a very great quality, seeing a knight her neighbour, who was rich and a goodly Gentleman, shee fell in Loue with him, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king on him with great affection, but not descouering her passion. Some-time after, the Diuill, espying this
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:3511:282"/>
Gentlewoman, tooke vpon him the shape of this knight, and proceedes in such sort, as hee winnes the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman, vpon condition that hee should marry with her. Shee who thought it had beene her knight, accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of him, and receiued him manie nights into her Chamber where hee late with her. In this sort they spent some monethes, during the which the Diuill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded her not to send any message vnto him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for that their businesse must continue secret: and when hee should see her, hee would not seeme to knowe her: and therefore although shee were some-times before the true Knight, shee made no shewe of her affection, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so shee imputed it to dissimulation that hee spake not vnto her, and gaue no signe of that which concerned their Allyance. Some-times after, the Gentlewomans Mother gaue her Daughter a certaine relick to weare about her. Whereat the fayned knight counter fetting an amazement, came no more, and so some monethes were spent: during the which the Gentlewoman know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the true Knight made Loue to another, shee grewe into an extreame iealousie: and not able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure this distemperature in her braine, shee sent one daie to intreate him to come and speake with her, hauing some-thing to say vnto him. The Knight ignorant of the cause, but other-wise a courteous Gentleman, went pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently vnto her, found her alone, and sayd that hee was come to heare and receiue her commandements. The Gentlewoman seeing him, and hearing him speake, like one that did scarce knowe her, shee beganne to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of him, for that so longtime hee had not cared to see her nor speake to her. The Knight much amazed as one that did not conceiue the meaning of this woman,
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:3511:283"/>
answered her in such sort as shee thought he dissembled to much. Growing therefore into choller, she beganne to chide him, saying, that seeing hee had enioyed her so long, there were no reason hee should nowe thinke to for-sake her, but he must performe the promise which he had made to marry her: and if he would do other-wise, besides that shee would make her complaintes to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie GOD &amp; the world, she would force him to the execution of his promise, seeing that hee would not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly performe it. The Knight grewe more amazed then before, and made her answere, that hee vnderstood nothing of her Language, and that she mistooke herself, for that hee had neuer had any secret conference with her: had promised her nothing, neither could shee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mande any thing at his hands. The Gentlewoman mad with this answere, in replying sayd. Do you not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that you did this and this with mee, repeating euery thing that had happened vnto her with the Imposter in the Knights shape: adding withall, you cannot auoide it to bee my husband and I your wife. The Knight beeing much amazed, beganne to protest that shee was much deceiued to thinke it to be true, and contending thereon, the Gentlewoman did note vnto him the day of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, which was vpon a sollemne feast daie. Then the Knight sware vnto her that vpon that daie, nor three weekes before, nor three weekes after he had not beene in the Towne, neither in his house, nor in hers: the which I will prooue vnto you so plainely, as you shall rest satisfied, and if any one hath deceiued you in my name, I am not to bee blamed. But to the ende you should not doubt of the truth of my saying, I will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently verefie it. Then (not departing from her,) hee
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:3511:283"/>
caused seauen or eight of his house-hold seruants and others to come, who vnacquainted with the cause, did sweare that the Knight had spoken the truth, and that all that time hee had beene aboue fiftie Leagues from thence. The Gentlewoman much troubled with this deposition, beganne to remember some particularities, and to apprehend that no mortall man could haue done them: but that they were Imposturs of Satan: so as soone after the retreate of the true Knight, shee beganne to finde the cause of this abuse: and detesting her foolish concupiscence, humbling her-selfe, shee resolued not to thinke anie more of marriage, but ended the remainder of her daies in a Monasterie. <hi>In the same Booke.</hi>

other, he tolde wonders at his returne. Hauing carried with him a great waxe-candle that was blest and light when as he entred. Going farre into the Caue, hee first past an iron dore: then hee went on from Chamber to Chamber vntill he found greene and stately gardins. In the midest of it was a hall richely furnished: and in it a verie faire Maide, carrying on her head a Crowne of gold, with her haire hanging downe, but from the Nauel downe-ward it was an horrible Serpent. Shee tooke LEONARD by the hand, &amp; led him to a Cofet of iron, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the which did lye two great black dogges, which beganne to barke horribly against him. But the Maide beganne to threaten them, and causing them to bee still, shee takes a great bundell of keyes which hunge about her necke, opens the Cofer and drawes forth all sortes of Medaills, of gold, siluer and copper: most of the which shee presented to this young man, who she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed them after-wards to manie in <hi>Basill.</hi> Hee added that this Maide sayd vnto him, that shee was issued from a Royall stocke: and that shee had beene mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strously transformed in that sort long since by horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Imprecations: neither did shee hope for any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuery, vntill that a chast young man, who had beene neuer poluted in anie sort, had kist her thrice. Then shee should recouer her first forme, and for a recompence shee would giue vnto the young man that should free her, the Treasure conteyned in that Cofer. Hee did affirme, that there-vpon hee came verie neere vnto her, and had kist her twise, but at either of them shee made such greeuious and horrible faces, as hee thought shee would deuower him or teare him in a thousand peeces.

Being carried by some disordred people into a Tauerne, hee could neuer afterwards finde the entry, nor the des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent into the Caue: for the which the poore wretch did often lament and weepe bitterly.

from the which it doth some-times cast such great flames of fire, as in the night it may be plainly seene 25. leagues off. Many haue imagined, that it was some vaine of gold that was molten, and entertained this fire. For this cause a IACOBIN would make tryall of it: causing a Chaine of Yron to bee forged, with an Yron Bucket at the end of it, and went to the place with foure other <hi>Spaniards.</hi> Beeing there, they let downe the Chaine with the Buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, the which was molten with some part of the Chaine. The <hi>Iacobin</hi> returned very angrie to <hi>Leon,</hi> complaines to the Smith that hee had made the Chaine much slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer then hee had commanded. The Smith makes an other much greater then the first. The same being done with a Bucket proportionable vnto it: the <hi>Iacobin</hi> goes the second time to the Mountaine with his companions, and lets downe the Chaine and Bucket as at the first: But it succeeded as before, and almost worse: for soden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there came out of this hollow place, a Ball of fire so great, as the <hi>Iacobin</hi> and his companions thought to haue dyed there: at the least they were so amazed, as they had no more list to meddle with that fire, but returned much terrified vnto the Towne, without euer speaking more of the Mountaine, or of the Treasure. I haue knowne a Priest in the same Towne, who hauing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with a <hi>Spanish</hi> Treasurer, had oportunitie by his meanes to send a Letter to the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> in the which hee beseeched his Maiestie to furnish him with 200. slaues to worke in this Mountaine, promising to drawe forth wonderfull great Treasures. The King sent him word, that he should worke at his owne charge if he would: as for him, hee had no slaues to send him. So the Mountaine remained still in that place, with-out stirring

Then they went to search along the bankes of the riuer which was neere, where they found great store of stuffe, Couerlets, and vessell of earth and wood, which they had hidden in the Reeds, with about 120000. crowns in gold wrought, the which COMACCO Lord of the Village had hidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there thinking to saue it from the <hi>Spaniards</hi> hands.

We will present that which he speaketh of those of our time, following the scope of this our collection of Histories.</p>
            <p>Vpon the 14. day of September 1509. an horrible Earth-quake so shooke the Cittie of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> for the space of eighteene dayes, that all the walles towards the Sea, and all the houses adioyning, were quite ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne,
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:3511:289"/>
&amp; Ditches filled vp with the ruines. The Castle was throwne downe where the <hi>Turke</hi> layes his treasure, together with his fiue Towers, and the Palace where-as the Lyons are kept. In like manner all the conduits that conuey water from <hi>Danubius</hi> to <hi>Constantinople</hi> were sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and spoiled. The straight of the Sea betweene the Cittie and the Towne of <hi>Pera,</hi> moued in such manner, that the water flashed ouer the walles on eyther side. The Custome-house was cleane ouer-turned into the Water. Thirteene thousand persons were slaine with ruines in Earthquake.</p>
            <p>The yeare following, almost all <hi>Italy</hi> was shaken with diuerse reiterated Earth-quakes. The yeare 1517. an Earth-quake in <hi>Germanie</hi> ouer-threwe two thousand houses and Granges at <hi>Nordlingen</hi> and there-about. All <hi>Portugall</hi> was shaken the yeare 1531. Fifteene hundreth fayre great Houses were ouer-throwne in the Cittie of <hi>Lisbon:</hi> and almost all the Churches fell downe. This Earth-quake endured eight dayes, and seauen or eyght times a day shooke the Cittie exceedingly. Also the ground opened in many places, whence issued a conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ayre that engendred a Plague, which carryed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye an exceeding multitude of people. Two yeares after, there was an Earth-quake at <hi>Tergow</hi> in <hi>Zwitzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which turned a pritty bigge Riuer from his course, where-into it entred not againe, till it had vnder-mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and ouer throwne a little Hill that hemmed it in. Presently there-vpon the Towne of <hi>Basill</hi> was shaken very sore with three seuerall Earth quakes, in lesse then a moneth.</p>
            <p>In the yeare 1537. the Country of <hi>Pouzol</hi> was so forely shaken with Earth-quakes, for the space of twenty
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:3511:289"/>
moneths and aboue that not an edifice remained whole and entire. But toward the end of September, in the yeare following, this Earth-quake began againe with such vehemencie, and with-out discontinuing eyther night or day, that the Sea reculed two hundreth paces backe, where-vpon ensued the taking of a huge quantity of Fish. The 30. day of the same moneth, a great conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent of land betweene the foote of the Mountaine cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Barbaro,</hi> and the Sea by the Lake <hi>Auerna,</hi> seemed to rise vp, and suddenly to take the forme of a Mountaine. The next morning about two of the clocke, this Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of earth cleauing in sunder, began to vomit forth flames of fire, with a wonderfull noyse. Amidest those flames it cast out <hi>Pumyce</hi> stones and Flints, with such a company of stinking Ashes, that they couered all the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines of <hi>Pouzol,</hi> and the fields adioyning: the Trees were borne downe, and the Vines a quarter of a mile about were reduced to powder, The Foules and Beasts of the fields had their share of it. As for the inhabitants of <hi>Pouzel,</hi> they saued them-selues in <hi>Naples.</hi> These stink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ashes blewe aboue eyght miles abroad, beeing very drye close to the ouer-ture, but sulpharous and moyste a farre off.

The flames endured diuers moneths.</p>
            <p>The twentith day of Ianuary 1538. <hi>Basil</hi> was shaken againe with an Earth-quake, and two yeares after in the moneth of December all <hi>Germanie</hi> had experience of it, with the ruines and spoiles of many buildings. The

The wars, plagues, famines, inundations of seas and riuers, happening after such signes from heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, are noted in the histories of our time: as wee also purpose to present the histories of them in their fit place. On Su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>day the first day of March 1584. in the Countries of <hi>Lyonnois, Masconnois Dauphine, Sauoy, Piemont, Valais, Suisserland</hi> &amp; <hi>Bourgondy,</hi> betweene a 11. &amp; 12. a clock at noone, the skie cleare &amp; bright and the Sun shyning, happened a suddaine earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, which lasted not aboue ten or eleuen minutes at that time. It was chiefly perceiued by the crackling of
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:3511:290"/>
windowes, clapping of dores, shaking of houses, beames, and trees togither, with a great noise and roaring in the aire. Many chimneis fell downe, diuers walles crackt in sunder, and the foundations of certaine houses shooke, namely about the lake of <hi>Lausanne,</hi> especially in the Countries of <hi>Vaut, Fossigny, Chablais</hi> &amp; places adioyning.

The next day, this earth-quake redoubled about the vpper end of the Lake of <hi>Lausanne,</hi> and on Tuesday both in the morning and at night it waxed greater with winde and sleete, but on Wedensday betweene 9. and 10. of the clock in the morning this which followeth happened in a certaine place of the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try being some two houres iourney fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this vpper end of the Lake, and foure Harguebuze shot or there about from the towne of <hi>Aille,</hi> appertayning to the <hi>Canton</hi> of <hi>Berne.</hi> A great quantity of earth tumbling from the top of the mountaines (like an impetuous floud of waters rushing downe the rocks) lanched it selfe forth, as some haue affirmed, the length of a mile, not so much by it owne naturall motion, which tended downe-ward, as pushed forward by winds and exhalations mingled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong. This earth ran so violently along, that in an instant it couered the places which were next belowe it, vpon the which it disgorged it selfe, and carried all the ground that it met withall before it: which rouled along as furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously as the first: &amp; it was like to a rough sea, where one waue driues on another. The plaines were not only carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away, but the hills that ouerlooked the bottoms were likewise remooued. Now it is to be noted that the place of this first motion of the earth was at the mouth of a straite caused by diuers hillocks which are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly sou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:3511:291"/>
in the nookes of mountaines. At the mouth and issue of this straite was <hi>Corberi</hi> a small village or hamlet of some 8. houses, and 10. or 11. granges with certaine mills, that were driuen by the water of a little brooke. The earth rushed so furiously on this village, that suddainly it was al couered ouer, except one house, where it chanced that the good-man astonished with the noise hee heard, told his wife that he was perswaded the end of the world was come, &amp; therefore willed her ioyne with him in praier vnto GOD, that it might please him to haue mercy on them. Whervpon falling on their knees in their house they rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped such fruite of their praiers, that the earth which rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led along, past like a raging waue ouer their house with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any hurt, saue the good-man himself, that was a little hurt in the head. As for the other houses &amp; granges they were all cast downe, and almost quite couered ouer. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other notable thing happened in this very place, namely a Child of 12. or 13. weekes old was found safe &amp; sound in his Cradle, hauing his poore mother dead by him, who laying her armes ouer the Cradle for to saue her Child had her braines beaten out with the fal of the house. The like befell a little girle of a yeare old found safe and well vnder the ruines of another house. As for the milles they were broken all to peeces. A meruailous matter happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For standing in a lowe place the beame of the wheele, and the wheele it selfe were found whole and entier on the top of a little hill 500. paces higher then the scituation of the Mill. Moreouer the further this deluge of earth ran downe-ward, the more the desolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on augmented. For shooting it selfe against the village of <hi>Yuorne,</hi> which lay vnderneath <hi>Corberi,</hi> it buried an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth persons aliue (some say more) two hundreth &amp; 40.

milch-kine, and a number of Horse and Oxen.

            <p>On the fift day of September beeing Saterday 1590. according to the ancient computation, and an houre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Sunne set, the earth began to shake in <hi>Austria, Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uia, Bohemia, Misnia, Silesia</hi> and <hi>Lusatia.</hi> But a little after, to witte, betweene twelue and one of the clock at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, this Earth-quake began againe thorow all the Prouinces aforesaid, with a meruailous shaking, and most of all in <hi>Vienna,</hi> the capitall Cittie of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dutchy of <hi>Austria:</hi> where the toppe of the great steeple of Saint <hi>Stephens</hi> Church, was so shaken that a number of mighty huge stones fell downe from it vpon the roofe of the Church: and the whole frame of the said steeple was moued with such vehemencie, that they were faine to new repaire it. Another steeple by it, wherein hangs one of the greatest Bels in <hi>Europe,</hi> was like-wise shaken. Not farre from the <hi>Scottish</hi> gate, the Steeple of a Church was ouer-throwne, and the Church it selfe was so cleft in sunder, that they were forced to take it downe. It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened at the same time, that a certaine Butcher, which vsed to lye a nights in his stall fast by that <hi>Scottish</hi> gate, vpon a suddaine felt his stall beaten downe with the stones that tumbled on it in very great aboundance, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out receiuing any hurt, or so much as once touched with those stones in any part of his body. Contrarilye the Sunne an Inne in the Citty, was dashed all to peeces with the fall of a steeple that stood by it. And diuers persons were brained, namely the Mistresse of the house, her Daughter and Mother, two rich Merchants, that had fiue thousand Crownes in gold found about them, the Poste
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:3511:292"/>
of <hi>Lintz</hi> and three other men: whose bodies at length were drawne forth from vnder the ruines. Besides this Saint <hi>Michels</hi> steeple, a Church of the Iesuits, and the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles of Saint <hi>Laurence</hi> and Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> Churches fell downe. There was neither building, bulwarke, Church nor house within the walles of <hi>Vienna</hi> which was not sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, crakt, broken, or in some sort damnified by this earth-quake. All the inhabitants got them out of the Citty with all speede, and went into gardens and other voyde open places.</p>
            <p>In a village not farre from <hi>Vienna,</hi> called <hi>Hernalsi,</hi> the Church and diuers houses fell downe. Asmuch happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the towne of <hi>Oula,</hi> another village named <hi>Siegeitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirchen</hi> had the Church, the parsonage house, and the walles of the Church-yard ouerthowen: <hi>Pixendorf,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther village was quite and cleane cast downe.

In other places diuers persons were hurt and killed with the ruines of houses. Two miles from <hi>Vienna,</hi> a Mill that stood on the water, was hoisted vp and throwne a good way of vpon the dry Land: and a great sorte of fish were cast vp on the banks of the same riuer. A little beneath <hi>Vienna,</hi> the ground o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, whence issued such a stinking pestilent vapor, that the inhabitants about it were not able to endure it. The ouerture was foure foote broade, very long, and so deepe that it could not bee sounded.

But IOHN, ARIAS and ANTHONY, runne and defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in such sort, as they kill foure of the Assaylants, and force the rest to retire with more speede then they had entred. In the meane time the Marriners goe on their course, and leaue the fregate farre behinde them.

These soldiars being followed by a <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugall</hi> Surgion, a valient man entred into the riuer with their Marriners and watered. But as they returned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their shippe, behold the enemies came swarming downe on either banke, who with a shower of stones and arrowes thought to beate downe the soldiars and to sinke the boate. But the soldiars couered themselues so well with their Targetts, and the Marriners did their duties so

well in rowing, as they got out of the riuer into the open Sea. But for that the flud cast them backe hauing no winde, three great vessells manned with all that was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for the warre, and which carried many Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Country, came to inuest them. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander called ZVDAMEC, was of IAVA, who appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with a chiefe barke, which carried a hundred and fifty men. As for the <hi>Portugalls,</hi> they resolued to die, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to yeeld to become slaues: and after they had recommended themselues to GOD, they prepared corragiously to the combate. The Barber beganne, and layed hold of the prowe of their chiefe vessell with such force, as his foure Companions had meanes to enter into it, and hee had meanes to leape in after them.

Captaine VASQVES FER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NAND CAESAR, running with a shippe of war along the straight of <hi>Gibraltar</hi> was inuested by six foysts of <hi>Moores.</hi> They desired nothing more, then this prey, and thinking it impossible for him to escape them, they beganne to shoute for ioye, then with their Arrowes, Harguebuzes and Muskets, they sought to oppresse him. CAESAR plaied with his Artillery, to keepe them from bording him, auoyding their blowes, with his rowing, and still killing some one of them: by meanes whereof their choller was some-what cooled which hee descouering, he ranne vpon three of these foysts that were togither, the winde hauing driuen away the three others and kept them aloofe. The enemies came also to incounter him wherevpon he set fire to a great peece of Ordynance, so; as the boullet passing from prowe to poupe of one of these three foysts, brake all the owers. The <hi>Moores</hi> drewe this may med foyst betwixt the two others, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payred it as well as the time would giue them leaue. Then they ioyne againe and charge CAESAR, who running vp and downe with a braue resolution, and incorraging his soldiars with a loude voice, hee did so batter these foysts with his great shot, as the Assaylants found a harder par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie then they expected, final'y a great shot carried away most of the slaues in one of the foysts: so as the <hi>Moores</hi> hauing lost many soldiars slaine with the Cannon, seeing

two of their foysts broken, and that the taking of CAESAR would cost them deere, they left the fight. This Captaine being alwayes of a valiant spirit, followed the foysts: but for that they went with oares and hee sailed, the winde being scant hee could not ouer-take them: so as hee put into the Port of <hi>Malaga,</hi> to burye such men as had beene slaine, and to cure the wounded. <hi>In the same Booke, Chap.</hi> 2.</p>

This valiant exploite did greatly amaze the enemies, and filled the besieged with great hope: the Commander of them intreated VEGA to returne and to ioyne with Captaine SOVSA, who had some ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels to indomage this fleete the more easily: where-vnto VEGA yeelded, although hee had a priuate quarrell with SOVSA, and that hee was hurt. Hee therefore with as great hazard as at the first time, forced through the enemies fleete againe, aduertised SOVSA of the estate of the besieged: and when it began to flowe, they two with their Souldiers entred fight with them, the which

continued long, and was very furious. The enemies lost tenne vessels that were sunck, a great number slaine, and many hurt.

It happened after the Battaile that a Monke a <hi>Suisse,</hi> called BVRCARD: who had made a voyage into <hi>France</hi> with the Emperours consent, to bring in this armie, going forth on Horse-backe, as it were to triumph for this defeate of his Countrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and marching with his Caske on, but his beuer was vp, and his face was vncouered, that hee might with more ease behold the dead bodies, among the which he marched, he began to cry out, O pleasant spec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle, what a goodly thing it is to marche in this medow bedeckt with Roses: at those words a <hi>Suisse</hi> lying vpon the place, and breathing more for the libertie of his country, then for his owne life, being so neere his death, hee awakes, and rising as well as hee could vpon his

            <p>In the yeare 1514. the <hi>Suisses</hi> going to succor MAXI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MILIAN SFORZA Duke of <hi>Milan,</hi> had the gard of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uare,</hi> the which they defended with such resolution, as notwithstanding that the <hi>French</hi> made a furious battery against the walles, yet the <hi>Suisses</hi> shewed to haue so little feare of them, as they would neuer suffer the Towne gate, which lookt into the campe to be shut. A breach being made, they endured an assault courragiously, and repulst the Assaylants. And which is more, the night following, beeing led by Captaine MOTIN, they went (without attending the succors that came vnto them) to charge the <hi>French</hi> armie, marching directly to the Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, the which they wonne valiantly, beeing two and twentie peeces, and carryed them the next daie in try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph to <hi>Nouare,</hi> hauing slaine a great part of the <hi>French</hi> armie, and put the rest in rout: the which we will describe more amply in the following discourse, where wee will write of great battailes giuen in diuers partes of the worlde, since a hundred and fiftie yeares.

<pb n="585" facs="tcp:3511:298"/>
that the <hi>Venetian</hi> armie approched to assault them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde, they despayred of victory (which they held for certaine the daie before) so as it growing late, they did sound a retreate, and taking their Artillery, vpon their shoulders, they turned their squadrons, and holding still their accustomed discipline, they marched softly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Milan,</hi> with such amazement to the <hi>French,</hi> as not any one of foote or horse-backe durst followe them. There were onelie two Companies of theirs, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fled into a farme house, were burnt by the <hi>Venetian</hi> light horse men. The rest of the armie returned to <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan</hi> without disorder, shewing the same countenance and resolution: and some say they buried in the ground fiueteene peeces of great ordinance, which they had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten at the first Incounter, for that they had no meanes to carrie them away. All men say, that for a long time there had not beene seene a more furious and fearefull battaile in <hi>Italie.</hi> TRIVVLCE (an ancient Captaine which had seene much) sayd, that this battaile had beene performed by Giants, not by men: and that eighteene battailes in which hee had beene, were but combats of little children in respect of that: and some hold that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the <hi>Canon</hi> the <hi>Suisses</hi> had gotten the victory, who being entred at the first charge into the fortifications of the <hi>French,</hi> and hauing taken from them the most of their peeces, had alwaies wonne ground.

that their poore innocent subiects who were not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with such quarrells, should smart for it. That they must ende this quarrell betwixt themselues.

            <p>The Lord of a little Towne in the Principalitie of <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mona</hi> in the Realme of <hi>Naples,</hi> shewed himselfe coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous and proud in his gouernement: so as his poore sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects could not subsist, but were strangely opprest by him. An honest man, but very poore and contemned, did for some occasion hurt a Hound belonging to this Lord very sore: Who greatly mooued for the death of his Dogge, caused this poore Man to bee layde holde on, and imprisoned in a hoale. After some dayes, the garde which kept all the doores carefully shutte, comming to open them according to their custome, to giue him a little bread, they found not their prisoner in his hoale. Hauing sought all places for him, and found
<pb n="626" facs="tcp:3511:319"/>
no markes nor shew of his escape, in the end they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted their Lord with this wonder, who at the first mockt and threatned them, but vnderstanding the trueth after-wards, hee was no lesse amazed then the rest. Three dayes after this Alarum, all the doores of the prison and of the Dungeon beeing shutte as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the same Prisoner with-out the knowledge of any, was found shutte vp fast in the former Dunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, hauing the face and countenance of a man distrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: who required them that they should lead him pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently vnto their Lord, to whome hee had some-things of great and waighty importance to impart. Beeing brought before him, hee tolde him that hee was come from Hell. The occasion was, that beeing no longer able to endure the rigour of the prison, vanquished with despaire, fearing death, and voyde of good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, hee had called the Diuell to his ayde, that hee would drawe him out of that captiuitie. That soone after the euill spirit had appeared vnto him in the Dungeon, in a hideous and terrible forme, where they had made an agreement, according to the which hee had beene drawne and carryed from thence, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out greeuous torments, then cast head-long into pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces vnder-ground, that were wonderfull hollow, as in the bottome of the earth, where hee had seene the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of the wicked, their punishments, darkenesse, and horrible miseries, seates that were stincking and feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: Kings, Princes, and great men plunged in darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, where they burnt in flaming fire, with vnspeake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able torments; that he had seene Popes, Cardinals and other Prelates attired in state, and other sorts of men in diuers equipages, afflicted with distinct punishments in
<pb n="627" facs="tcp:3511:319"/>
very deepe gulphes, where they were tormented inces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly. Adding, that hee had knowne there many of his acquaintance, namely one of his greatest friends, who knew him and inquired of his estate: the prisoner ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing tolde him that their Country was in the hands of a cruell Lord: hee then inioyned him, that beeing retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, he should command this rough Maister to leaue his tyranous vsage: and to tell him, that if hee continued, his place was markt in a certaine seate thereby, which he shewed vnto the prisoner. And to the end (sayd this spirit vnto the prisoner) that the Lord of whome wee speake, may giue credit vnto thy report: bid him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the secret counsell, and the speech wee had to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, when as we carryed armes together in a certaine warre, and vnder Commanders that hee named vnto him. Then he told him in particular this secret, their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, the wordes and mutuall promises: the which the prisoner deliuered distinctly, one after another in order, vnto this Lord, who was wonderfully amazed at this message, wondering how it could bee, that things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by him alone, the which hee had neuer discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to any, should bee decifred vnto him so boldly by a poore subiect of his, who did represent them, as if hee had read them in a Booke.</p>
            <p>They adde, that the prisoner hauing inquired of the other with whom hee deuised in Hell, if it were possible and true, that so many Men whom hee did see stately ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrelled, should feele any torments: the other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, that they were burnt with continuall fire, and tortured with greeuous and vnspeakeable punishments, and that all those ornaments of Golde and Scarlate, were nothing else but burning fire so couloured.</p>

The poore pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner beeing set at libertie, seemed to those that came vnto him at his returne to his house, as a man distracted and growne dull, which doth neither heare nor see, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes pensiue, speaking little, and scarce answering the questions that were demanded him.

When the Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster returned, his Horse (which had his head at the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow) knew him, and began to neigh.

<pb n="629" facs="tcp:3511:320"/>
with an intent to keepe him safe, that hee might not bee lost, and that hee had carefully executed his Maisters commandement. They had much a doe to shackle this poore beast, and to let him downe with Ropes from the top of the Tower. Soone after, some whome this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman had robd, resoluing to pursue him in Iustice, his Horse-keeper sayde vnto him. Maister saue your selfe, shewing him a Sack, out of the which hee drew many horse-shoes puld by him from horse-feete to staye their course in the voyage which they vnder-tooke against his Maister, who in the end being taken, and put in prison, inrreated his Horse-keeper to helpe him. You are too fast bound there, answered the seruant, I cannot free you. But the Maister making great instance, in the end his seruant sayde: I will drawe you out of captiuitie, so as you make no signe with your hands thinking to saue your selfe. Which agreed vppon, hee takes him with his shackles and Bolttes, and carryes him through the ayre. This miserable Maister beeing amazed to see himselfe in such a strange field, began to crye out. Oh <hi>eternall GOD, whether doe they carrye mee?</hi> Sodenlye his seruant (that is to say the Diuell) let him fall in a Marish: then comming home to the house, lettes the Gentle-woman his Wife to vnderstand, in what estate and where her Husband was, that they might goe and deliuer him.</p>

Going forth of the village where hee had beene, hee found a little Hermitage and Chapell with certaine lattise windowes of woode, and a Lampe burning within it. Beeing alighted from his Horse, hee did his deuotion, then casting his eye into the Hermitage, hee did see to his thinking, comming from vnder the ground three persones which came towardes him with their heads couered, and then to stand still. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing be held them a little, seeing their haire shine and sparkle, although hee were held to bee verie valiant, yet hee was affraied, and going to Horse-backe hee beganne to flie. But lifting vp his eyes, hee descouers these per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons which went a little before him and seemed to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companie him. Recommending him-selfe continually vnto almightie GOD, hee turned first one waie then an other waie, but this troupe was alwaies aboute him. In the ende hee coucht a short Lance which hee carried, and spurd for-warde to strike them: but these vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions went as fast as the Horse, so as ANTHONIE was forced to take them in his company, vnto the gate of his lodging, where there was a great Court.</p>

Bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing demanded, and not able to drawe anie thing from him, shee sent for a verie friend of his, a Learned man, who came presently: and finding him as pale as a dead

            <p>They accept of the condition, fit them-selues with stuffe, and passe the time merilie for a monethes space. At the ende whereof, AYOLAS two companions go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to bedde earlie, and hee late in his studie, hearing a great noise as it had beene of manie iron chaines, sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken togither, hee went out of his studie, with his sword,

and in his other hand his candle-light, then hee plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him-selfe in the midest of the Hall, without a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his companions, expecting what should beecome of this noise, the which in his opynion came from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the staires, answering to a great Court, right bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Hall. Beeing in this expectation hee desco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers at the staires dore a verie greeuious and fearefull vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, of a Carcasse that had nothing at all but bare boanes, drawing about his feete and the middle of his bodie, these chaines which made such a noyse. This vision stayed, and AYOLA resuming courrage, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to coniure it, that hee should let him vnderstand in some conuenient manner what hee would haue. The vision beganne to crosse his armes, to hold downe his head, and to becken him with one hand to followe him downe the staires. AYOLA answered, goe before and I will followe thee: where-vpon the vision begannne to go downe softly, like vnto one that were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>This renewed his feare, yet incorraging him-selfe againe, hee sayd vnto the vision, thou seest that my candle is out, I will goe and light it againe: if thou wilt tarrie for mee heere in this same place, I will returne presently vnto thee againe. Hee ranne to the harth where the fire was, and lighted his candell, and came to the staires, where he found the vision standing there and then hee followed it. Hauing crost the Court of the lodging, they enter into a great gardin, in the midest whereof was a well: the which made AYOLA thinke that this vision would doe him some harme: and therefore hee stayed. But the vision then made a
<pb n="636" facs="tcp:3511:324"/>
signe vnto him to goe to another place in the Garden, and as hee went thether, the vision sodenly vanished away. AYOLA being alone, began to call him, protesting that he would do any thing that was in his power, and stayed there awhile: But the vision appeared no more, and the <hi>Spaniard</hi> returned to his Chamber, and awaked his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, who seeing him so pale, gaue him a little Wine and some comfitures, inquiring of his aduenture, the which hee reported vnto them. Soone after this accident being bruted throughout all the Citty, the Gouernor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired carefully of the manner of it, and vnderstanding all circumstances by the relation of AYOLA, hee caused some to digge where-as the vision vanished away. There they found a carcase in Chaines as AYOLA had seene it, in a deepe Sepulchre, from whence being drawne and interred in an other place with others, all the noise which had beene before in this great lodging ceased.
