            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entlemen, and you the Burgesses of
the House of COMMONS; I am
commanded by the Lords to let
you know, that they have taken serious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation
of the Propositions made by you
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59542:3"/>
the other day at a Conference concerning
the Church-government in this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>First, I am commanded to put you in
minde what have passed already upon this
Occasion before in the maintenance of the
Church-government of this Kingdom,
wherein the House of Commons have
shewed such great affections to the good of
the Church and of the State therein for the
maintenance of it.</p>
            <p>First, that the Church-government in
both Kingdomes, is that which were so be
vvished, but no alteration or innovation
msust be of that vvhich is setled by the
Lavves of each Kingdom, and enacted by
them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that the Government of the
Church of <hi>England</hi> is setled and established
by the Lawes and Statutes of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to the uniting of a brotherly love and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59542:3"/>
Government in both Kingdomes under his
Majesties Dominion.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I am commanded to let you
know their Lordships pleasure in this, or in
any thing else that may conduce to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of Almighty God, the service of our
King, and the good of our Kingdom, and
will be very ready to give such assistance as
you shall propound, or upon debate with
them, thinke fit to advance the worke you
were pleased to deliver unto them.</p>
            <p>And finding also that there have been,
and having great cause to suspect that there
still are, even during this present sitting in
Parliament, endeavours to subvert the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall
Lawes of this Kingdom and of
<hi>England,</hi> whereby they may introduce the
exercise of a tyrannicall Government by
most pernicious and wicked Counsels,
Plots, and Conspiracies, that hath been
taught against this Kingdom, and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59542:4"/>
of <hi>England,</hi> with divers innovations
and superstitions, that have been brought
into this Church, multitudes driven out of
his Majesties Dominions, with the great
suppressing of them by the Bishops and
their tyrannicall Government over the
Church, and the good religious Ministers
therein.</p>
            <p>And therefore because the Government
of the Church doth remain as properly to
proceed from you, as from us, therefore if
you shall thinke fit that any thing else shall
be propounded by you, that may be effected
for the Government of the Church and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
or if you do not propound, their
Lordships will then let you know their
Propositions; if you be not now provided
to confer about it, we shall when you please
debate the same, and give you such reasons
for it, as you shall thinke fit of, to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and praise of God, and the good of our
King and Kingdom.</p>
