            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>O England, England</hi> If thou bee'st not given quite over to a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate

yet remaining in Thee, be warn'd, be warn'd by this <hi>Trance,</hi> by the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
objects, the hideous and horrid apparitions thereof: If no <hi>temporall</hi>
respects can win Thee, let the apprehensions of <hi>eternall</hi> ruin work upon
Thee: If the hopes of Heaven cannot prevail with Thee, let the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Hell deterr Thee, which are represented to the very life unto
Thee in this ensuing Vision. Be not accessary to thy owne <hi>destruction,</hi>
to thy own <hi>damnation;</hi> Let not thy children be deluded any longer with
chymeras of more liberty, and advancement of common good. 'Tis true,
<hi>To love one's Countrey</hi> (which is the specious pretence of all these insur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections)
is a commendable thing, yet it is but a <hi>Pagan</hi> precept; <hi>To feare
God, to honour his Priests, to give</hi> Caesar <hi>his due, not to do evill that good
may come of it,</hi> these are all <hi>Christian</hi> precepts, and <hi>Scripture</hi> principles.</p>

Poor thing, thou want'st a <hi>Physitian</hi> to cure thee, rather than a <hi>Divine</hi>
to confute thee: Return then, O return to thy wits, to thy old English tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
again, els 'tis high time for Thee to make thy last Will, and that the
Bell should ring out to invite thy Neighbours to the funerall of thy <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty;</hi>
And because I have already half promis'd, I will lay this <hi>Epitaph</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Vch is the force of Fancy, so large is the reach, so
boundlesse is the prerogative of humane <hi>Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi>
that though the small concave of a scull
some two or three spans compasse be her ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and naturall habitation, yet the whole Globe
of the Earth, nor all the elementary world can totally confine
her, but she will at pleasure clime up to the skies, and make
a scale of the Starrs to conduct her to the Empyrean Heaven;
Thence she can descend in a trice to the great Abysse, and take
a survey of the Kingdom of darknesse; And though it be a
maxime among Divines that <hi>ab Orconulla redemptio,</hi> there's no
return out of Hell, and that the passage back thence is irreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
yet the Imagination of man hath this privilege, that she
can make egresses and regresses, she can enter, and come off
cleer thence when she list, and all this if need be in an <hi>instant;</hi>
wherein she seemes to partake of that admired quality which
is inherent in that most comfortable creature the <hi>Light,</hi> who
is held the soveraign of all sensible qualities among the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers,
and to come neerest to the nature of a Spirit, which
creature requires but an instantaneous moment and point of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94590:3"/>
time to performe his office of illumination, and dilate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
throughout the Hemisphear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whence some inferre that
he is not corporeall, in regard it is an unquestioned principle
in nature that all <hi>bodies require a succession of time in their moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi>
but there is this difference twixt the <hi>Imagination</hi> and <hi>Light,</hi>
that there be some places whereinto Light cannot enter, but
there is no part of the Vnivers so impervious, where the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
may not make his accesses and recesses at pleasure; as
will appeare by the following example.</p>
            <p>IT fortun'd very lately that I was in a <hi>Trance,</hi> a strange kind
of Extasie surpriz'd me on a sudden, which lasted a good
while; during the time, me thought I was transported to
the remotest place, and of the greatest distance that possibly
could be from Heaven; me thought I was in <hi>Hell,</hi> in <hi>Hell,</hi> God
blesse us, among the Devils, and damned Spirits; I had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that golden branch, nor the help of a <hi>Sybilla Cumana</hi> to
conduct me up and down as the Trojan Prince had, but me
thought a Spirit did lead me gently and softly all along till I
came to <hi>Plutoes</hi> Palace, where a speciall Counsell was held to
take a strict examination what service the three Furies, <hi>Alecto,
Tisyphone,</hi> and <hi>Megaera,</hi> with other inferiour Fiends that were
their Assistants, had done on Earth, towards the advancement
of the Kingdom of darknes, since their last <hi>mission</hi> thither,
which was presently upon the apparance of the last blazing
Star in the yeare 1618. Pluto vouchsafed to be present and
preside at this Counsell, and to be <hi>Chaireman</hi> himself, to
which purpose he had a strong Legion of <hi>Cacodaemons</hi> for his
guard, but the businesse was prepared and facilitated for his
hearing before hand by a <hi>Committee</hi> appointed of purpose
for that end, whence I inferred that <hi>Committees</hi> were first
hatcht in Hell, especially some of those that we have now
adaies. The three ghastly daughters of Night appeard with
dreadfull fiery countenances before Puto, in lieu of aire they
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94590:4"/>
evaporated huge flakes of fire, which they tooke in, and let out
with the accents of their words, huge bunches of Snakes with
their tailes rooted in their sculls hung dangling and waving a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
their heads like dischevelld haire: A furious contestation
fell between them who should be Proloquutrix, but in regard
that <hi>Alecto</hi> and <hi>Tisyphone</hi> had given an account of their former
missions, the one of the <hi>League</hi> in France, the other of the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt</hi>
of the Hollander, it came now in due turn that <hi>Megaera</hi>
should have the priority of speech, so the youngest of the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarian</hi>
Girls began as followes;</p>
            <p>May your high <hi>Acherontic</hi> Majestie vouchsafe to understand,
that since the last happy Comet, which by the Parallax was
found to be in the Heaven, appeard, we have for 30 yeares toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
been more active, and more eager in your Majesties ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
than ever we were; We have incited the affections of the
foolish Inhabitants of the earth to war, and to worry one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
like Wolves in most places; To effect which our pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
hath been to bring the <hi>beggerliest</hi> and <hi>toughest</hi> people up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>richest</hi> and <hi>softest;</hi> We brought the <hi>Swead</hi> upon the
<hi>German,</hi> the <hi>Catalan</hi> upon the <hi>Castillian,</hi> the <hi>Tartar</hi> upon the
<hi>Chinois,</hi> the <hi>Scot</hi> upon the <hi>English,</hi> and now lastly, the <hi>Turke</hi>
upon the <hi>Venetian,</hi> and the <hi>Cosaque</hi> upon the <hi>Pole;</hi> We have
continued a lingring bloudy war in <hi>Germany</hi> for thirty yeares
together, which entangled into it most of the neighbouring
States; We have thrust divers Princes out of their ancient
Inheritances, among others the Duke of <hi>Lorain,</hi> and the <hi>Pals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave</hi>
of the <hi>Rhin;</hi> We brought two Grand Turks to be strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
which never happened before; We have often puzzled
<hi>Italy,</hi> we have made the Kings of <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> though
Brothers to bandy so fierce one against the other, as if the one
had been an Infidell, the other a Jew; But Sir, the most advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious
and signall services we have done to your infernall Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie
have been in the Iles of great <hi>Britaine</hi> and <hi>Ireland:</hi> For
whereas we divided our selves before, and went singly among
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94590:4"/>
other people, we went jointly thither all three, because we
might be sure to bring our ends home to our aime. The Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
fittest for us to work first upon was the <hi>Scot,</hi> who have been
so obedient to their Kings, that of above a hundred they brag
of, scarce two parts of three dyed in their beds; We did su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scitate
them first against their native King, and to appeare in a
daring hostile manner before him upon the borders; At which
time it cost us a great deale of labour so to besot the English,
to abase their courage, and entangle them with Factions (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
sure confidents among them to that end) that they durst
not present them battell, and this Sir was an important peece
of service, for had they fought then, or had they been sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
afterwards of the Nationall dishonor they received at that
time, their King being in the field, and consequently had they
stucke to him afterwards to have vindicated it, all those Wars
we have fomented since might have been prevented: We
shortly after transmitted the same Spirit of Insurrection into
<hi>Ireland,</hi> who being encouraged by the good successes the <hi>Scot</hi>
had (for he had what he list, yet could he not sit quiet) and the
<hi>Irish</hi> Commissioners being but harshly entertained by this
English Parlement who intended to send over a Deputy that
should pinch them more than they were before in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,
besides in that they revoked that leave which the King
had granted under hand and seale to the Spanish Ambassadors
to have some part of <hi>Straffords</hi> Army in <hi>Ireland</hi> (which were
our prime instruments for the Rebellion) to go for <hi>Spaine,</hi>
with other incentives, we stird the <hi>Irish</hi> also to rise in bloud,
which they did to some purpose. Then came we to worke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>English,</hi> whom we found as fit to receive our impression
as Flax is to take fire, in regard of their long surfet of peace
and plenty. We broke up one Parlement because most of the
Members thereof were not for our turn; The first thing we did
in <hi>this</hi> Parlement was to indue them with a faculty to create
feares and jealousies whereof we have made excellent use, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94590:5"/>
although all those feares and jealousies appeare since to the
common people, and City of <hi>London,</hi> more plain than their
nose on their faces to be but forgeries, yet we have so infatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
their intellectualls that we make them still adore the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventors
of them. And to give your <hi>Stygian</hi> Majestie among
divers others one more pregnant and undeniable demonstration
what footing you have got you in that Island, we have within
these few yeares raised more <hi>Pythonesses</hi> (which the vulgar call
witches there) than ever were in that Island since your Majesty
tempted <hi>Eve:</hi> And we enabled our <hi>Pythonesses</hi> to send their
Imps abroad in pursuit of your service. We stood at the
Kings elbo when he passed that happy <hi>Act of continuance,</hi> and
and a <hi>Scot</hi> was our cheifest engine to work that; The City
of <hi>London</hi> stood us also in excellent stead to bring our designes
about; We made the riff-raff of that City, as <hi>V.</hi> with his Myr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mydons,
and <hi>B.</hi> with his bandogs (for so they called the rak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ells
they had raised) to <hi>rabble</hi> the King out of Town; We
brought also into <hi>London</hi> the silly Swaines of the Countrey in
whole swarmes upon they knew not what; VVe were in <hi>KIn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
field, and made the youthfull Generall of the Kings Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry
<hi>de gayeté de coeur</hi> to pursue the Parlements Cavalry so
far, as the day was lost by it, whereas if he had stuck Glose to
the Infantry the businesse had been dispatch'd then on the
Kings side, and so your Majesties service since had been fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated;
VVe were at <hi>Marston</hi> Moore, and made the same
Generall so impatient that he could not forbeare fighting till
the next day, else he had taken all the Roundhead Army in a
pound; VVe took great paines at <hi>Leycester</hi> that the King
should not march Northward, but fortifie the place and go
backe to <hi>Naseby</hi> where we had our Imps that bestird them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
notably; VVe so manag'd the businesse afterwards that
we made the King, because he is a profest enemy to your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
to go disguis'd in a Servingmans habit to his Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
the <hi>Scots,</hi> and we prevail'd so far with them that they
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94590:5"/>
delivered him over as a Sacrifice, and betraid him like <hi>Iudas</hi>
to the English who have crucified ever since like <hi>Iewes,</hi> by tos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
and tumbling him up and down, and by compulsory
meanes to work upon His conscience, and stretching it upon
the tenter; VVe made <hi>Pembrock</hi> Castle, and <hi>Colchester,</hi> with
other single (or rather simple) Counties to rise of purpose to
betray themselves: In summe, we have reduced that Kingdom to
a new conformity with this of your Majesties, to a sweet Chaos
of all confusion, we have brought the sway solely into the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
peoples hands; And never did common people more tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
act the part, and discover the genious of a common people
more lively, whose nature is still thursting after novelties and
Utopian reformations, though they foole themselves thereby
into a baser kind of slavery, finding when 'tis too late those
sprecious idaeas, and confused formes of Government they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
before, and hugg'd in their own conceits to be meet
absurdities, when they come to the application and practice
of them.</p>
            <p>And Sir, the most advantagious instruments we have used
to bring all this about, have been the <hi>Pulpit</hi> and the <hi>Presse;</hi> by
these we diffus'd those surmises and suppositious feares for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
spoken of, to intoxicate the braines of the people: In
stead of <hi>Lights</hi> we put <hi>Firebrands</hi> into their Churches, who, as
we did dictate unto them, did bawle out nothing but Sedition
and Bloud, we have made some of them to bring divers to have
as good an opinion of the <hi>Alchoran</hi> as of their Liturgie;
we have made secular <hi>Ordinances</hi> to batter down all ancient
Ecclesiastick <hi>Canons;</hi> we have made them to unsaint all those
whom they call Apostles in heaven, and to rob their Churches
on earth; we have made them put division twixt the <hi>Trinity</hi> it
self; we have made their Pulpiteers to preach the Law and
<hi>your Kingdome</hi> in the Church, but the Gospell and Heaven in
the Chamber; we have brought them to keep their <hi>Fast</hi> day
more solemnly then the <hi>Sabboth,</hi> upon which, we have made
them not only to sit in Counsell, but to put in execution all
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94590:6"/>
designs of bloud. But the main, and most materiall thing we
have made use of, was <hi>spirituall pride,</hi> your Majesties old ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
which we have infused into the mind of every
Mecanique and Countrey Swaine, who will boldly now under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
to expound any Text of Scripture, New or Ol, dupon the
warrant of their owne braines, and by the light of their own
fires; Insomuch that we have made that Book which they
call the <hi>Bible,</hi> that was ordained first for their <hi>Salvation,</hi> to be
the chiefest Instrument of their <hi>Damnation</hi> VVe have
brought these Exotic words, <hi>Plundering</hi> and <hi>Storming,</hi> which
were never known among them before, and that once abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
word, <hi>Excise,</hi> to be now familiar among them, they are
made all three free Denizons, and legitimated among them;
VVe have rais'd an Army of the dreggs of the people, though
of precious stuffe to your Majesty, and so puffed them with
the pride of their good successes, and so flesh'd them in Bloud,
that they are no more tender of a mans or womans life then
they are of a dog or a cats; We have made those that came Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioners
for Peace to be <hi>murthered,</hi> and those that came for
VVar to be thanked and <hi>hugged;</hi> VVe have reduced them to
such slavery as to make the very countenances of men to be
commented upon, and their very thoughts to be plundred; We
have made the mother to betray her child, the child the father,
the husband his wife, the servant his master; VVe have brought
a perfect tyranny ore their very <hi>soules</hi> and <hi>bodies;</hi> upon the one,
by tedious and endlesse imprisonment, with the forfeiture of
all their livelihoods before conviction or charge; upon the
other, by forcing them to swallow contradictory Oaths. On
that foolish superstitious day call'd <hi>Christmas,</hi> with other Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stivalls,
we have brought them to shut up their Churches, and
open their shops, so that in time they will forget the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
memory of their Saviours Incarnation; We have brought
them to have as little reverence of their <hi>Temples</hi> as of their
<hi>Tap-houses,</hi> and to hold the <hi>Church</hi> to be but a Charnell-house
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:94590:6"/>
of rotten bones; and though they cringe, and knee, and stand
bare before any wrangling Bench of Common Pleas, yet we
have so stiffned their <hi>joints,</hi> and made their <hi>heads</hi> so tender in
that which they call Gods House, that they can neither <hi>bow</hi> the
one there, nor scarce <hi>uncover</hi> the other; We have fil'd lately the
Tribunals in <hi>Westminster</hi> Hall with Favourers of your Cause,
which makes some of them look rather like <hi>Iuglers</hi> than
<hi>Iudges;</hi> We have made the Fundamentals of Law to be term'd
but Formalities; We have caus'd <hi>Magna Charta</hi> to be torne to
a thousand flitters, and stretched the privilege of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
so wide, that it hath swallowed up all other; We have
grub'd up and cast away those hopefull Plants that grew in
their two <hi>Seminaries</hi> of Learning, and set in their room grafts
of our own choice. And Sir, your precious children, and our
deare brethren, the Angels of the Army, have comported them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
notably for the improvement of your Majesties service
in all these things, into whom we have infus'd such principles
that <hi>Machiavill</hi> himself were he alive there, would be accounted
a Baby in comparison of them. Among divers other wholsome
maximes, we have instill'd this into their braines, that <hi>Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
must be supported by Villaines, and mischief cannot be safe but
by attempting greater;</hi> We have made the wealth of Town and
Countrey, of poore and rich, to glitter in Plunder upon their
backs; We make them to command Free-quarter of those who
who were fitter to aske <hi>them</hi> Almes; We have made them to
rifle the Monuments of the Dead, to rob the Lazaretto, to
strip the Orphane and Widow, to violate and pillage all things
that were dedicated to God; We have made them wreek their
revenge upon the very vegetables, to make socks of Surplices,
to water their beasts at the Font, to feed them on the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
Table, and to terme the thing they call a Sacrament, a
Two penny Banquet: Sir, we have turn'd supposed <hi>Superstition</hi>
to absolute <hi>Prophanesse,</hi> Government to Confusion, and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
to pure Slavery; We have brought their King to live
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94590:7"/>
in a manner upon Charity, and His Queen to beg of the
French Friers, and His Children to be a kind of Runnagates
up and downe the world; We have so intoxicated that deare
Daughter of yours the City of <hi>London,</hi> that she knowes not
which way to turn her self; And whereas her Apprentices did
rise up like <hi>Tigers</hi> against their King, they are now become
as so many silly <hi>Sheepe</hi> against our Army; We have puzzled
them with such vertiginous fancies and feares among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
that one neighbour dare not trust the other. To conclude
Sir, we have eclips'd the glory of the English Nation, we have
made them by all people far and near that ever had knowledge
of them, to be pittied by some, to be derided by others, to be
scorn'd of all, and to become the very taile of all Nations; In
fine Sir, we have brought that Kingdom to such a passe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion,
that it is a fit place only for your Imperial <hi>Phlegetontic</hi>
Majesty to inhabit; And Sir, there's never a Crosse now there
fright you, unlesse it be upon their Coines of Gold and Silver,
wheron they leave Crosses to be still in honour of your <hi>Pluto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi>
Highnesse, as you are <hi>Dis,</hi> and God of riches.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Megaera</hi> having thus given up her account in behalf of her self
and her two Sisters, they all bowed their snaky heads down to
their feet, which were toed with Scorpions, before the black
Throne of <hi>Pluto,</hi> who giving a humme that made all Hell to
tremble, answered thus:</p>
            <p>MY pretious and most trusty <hi>Tartarean</hi> Daughters, we highly
approve of the supererogatory service you have done us
for the propagation of the Stygian Empire upon earth, and
specially in great <hi>Brittany:</hi> we have sued a long time to have a
Lease of that Iland (touching <hi>Scotland</hi> we have no mind to go
thither our self) and we hope to obtaine it; therefore when you
have visited those of that Nation whom you have sent hither
already to people this <hi>P<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t,</hi> I would have you returne thither,
and prepare that place for one of my principall habitations:
The proper'st instrument you are to employ, is the <hi>Army,</hi> and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:94590:7"/>
you must continue to infuse such principles into their heads,
that they never desist till they have quite thrust out <hi>Religionem
ex solo, Regem ex solio,</hi> and <hi>Dominium ex salo.</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>Nec sic recedant odia, vivaces agat</l>
                  <l>Violentus iras animus, &amp; saevus furor</l>
                  <l>Eterna bella pace sublata gerat.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Make Rebell to fight against Rebell, Independant against Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian,
London against the Army, and all against the <hi>Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier,</hi>
till that Nation be wholly extinguish'd, that one may not
be left to pisse against a wall; Let them never rest till they have
made an end of the King who is our greatest enemy; Let those
Idolatrous <hi>Bishops</hi> which in that idle legend their <hi>Gospell</hi> are
call'd <hi>Angells,</hi> be utterly extirpated, and the very name of them
banish'd for ever, as the <hi>Tarquins</hi> were once at <hi>Rome;</hi> Let not a
Church or Chappell, or any consecrated place stand in the
whole Isle, I intend to have a new Almanack of Saints made at
my comming, for I have some Star-gazers there already fit
for my purpose; make haste, for feare a peace be shuffled up
on a sudden, and acquit your selves of your duties, and I may
chance get you <hi>Scotland</hi> for your reward.</p>
            <p>The three Furies with a most profound reverence replied,
May it please your Majestie, your Ferriman <hi>Charon</hi> is hourely
so pester'd with such multitudes of English and Scots Round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads,
that we were forced to stay a long time ere we could get
a passage hither, and we feare we shall be so hindred againe;
therefore we most humbly desire for our expedition, that your
Highnesse would vouchsafe to give us a speciall warrant to be
serv'd first with a <hi>non obstante</hi> when we come to the bankes of
<hi>Styx.</hi> You shall deare Daughters, saith <hi>Pluto,</hi> and my warrant
shall be adressed to a new Journey-man, an English Tarpaling
that came thither lately to serve <hi>Charon,</hi> upon whom I will lay
my commands of purpose to attend you upon all occasions.</p>
            <p>Having all this while listned unto what passed 'twixt <hi>Pluto
and his Furies,</hi> my Spirit lead me up and downe Hell to see
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:94590:8"/>
the various sorts of torments that are there, which indeed are
innumerable: the first I beheld was <hi>Ixion,</hi> tied with vipers to a
wheele, and whirld about perpetually, I might perceive a
multitude of lesser wheeles newly made thereabouts, whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
great numbers of English, and divers of my acquaintance
were bound; hard by I might discerne a huge company of
windmils, and bodies tied with ugly Snakes at every wing, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
round perpetually; a little further there were a great many
broken by millstones, who were whirld with them perpetually
about; in another place I might perceive black whirlepooles
full of tormented soules turning incessantly about: I asked
what might be the reason of so many whirling tortures, my
good Spirit answered, all these except <hi>Ixions</hi> wheele are new
torments appointed for english <hi>Roundheads,</hi> who have destroy'd
from foundation to top, all Government both of Church and
State; and as their brains turn'd round there, after every wind of
Doctrin, so their souls turn here in perpetuall paines of rota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
A little further I spied <hi>Prometheus</hi> removed thither from
<hi>Caucasis,</hi> with a ravenous Vulture tearing and feeding upon his
Liver, which as one part was eaten, renewed presently after,
and abundance of new commers were tormented in the same
manner, these I was told were English men also that are pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
like <hi>Prometheus,</hi> because as he is tortured so for stealing
fire from heaven, so those <hi>fierie Zelots</hi> of <hi>England</hi> would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuously
pry into the secret, and Cabinet Counsels of
God Almighty, and dive into those high points of Predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
Election, and Reprobation, being not contented <hi>sapere
ad sobrietatem,</hi> but expect ever and anon to have new lights and
flashes of illuminations. Then came I to the bottomlesse tub
which <hi>Danaus</hi> Daughters were a filling, a numberlesse company
of other such tubs were there, and English women and men
were incessantly labouring to fill them up with the stenchy
black waters of <hi>Acheron:</hi> Those I was told were those over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curious
people in <hi>England</hi> which would be never satisfied with
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:94590:8"/>
Christian Knowledge, and had no other devotion then to be
<hi>alwaies learning and never comming to the Truth,</hi> as these restlesse
fillers never come to the bottome; Then I beheld the most
horrid tortures of those Giants that would have thust <hi>Iove</hi> out
of heaven, and a world of English among them, who partaked
of the same punishments, because they had conspired upon
earth to dethrone their lawfull King; Not far further I might
espie glowing fiery tubs made Pulpit like, and I was told they
were prepared for those profane and presumptuous Mecanicks
and other Lay men, who use to preach in <hi>London,</hi> and abuse the
Sacred Oracles of God; and <hi>Vzza</hi> was not far off tormented
there for being so bold with the <hi>Arke;</hi> A little thereabouts I
saw hoopes of Iron were made <hi>Garter</hi>-like, of hot glowing
steele, these I was told were designed for those perjured Knights
of St <hi>George</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> to weare upon their legs, when they
come thither for breaking in the late war that solemn Oath
they had taken at their instalement, to <hi>defend the honour and
quarrells, the rights and dignities of their Soveraigne;</hi> A little
distant I might see divers brasse hoopes glowing with fire, and
they were scarfe-like, I was told they were ordained for those
Knights of the <hi>Bath</hi> to weare for Ribbands next their skins
when they came thither, for infringing that Sacred Oath they
made at their Election, which was, <hi>To love their Soveraigne
above all Earthly creatures, and for his right and dignity to live
and die;</hi> A little beyond I saw a <hi>Copper</hi> Table, with Chaires of
the same, all <hi>candent hot,</hi> I was told those were for perjured
English privy Concellors, who had bro<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>k their Oath to the
King, which they took <hi>to be true and faithfull servants unto Him,
and if they knew or understood any manner of thing to be attempted,
done, or spoken against His Majesties Person, Honour, Crown, or
Dignity, they swore to let and withstand the same to the uttermost
of their power, and cause it to be revealed, either to himself, or any
other of his Privy Councell;</hi> Some few paces off I might descry
a little <hi>round</hi> place like a Porters Lodgeat Court with a Fane
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:94590:9"/>
on the top of it, where was a new kind of exquisite torment
provided, but I could not discerne it by reason of the smoake;
for once a Secretary of State and his Son in <hi>England,</hi> who
though they were of differing opinions in every thing else,
yet jump'd in this, to destroy their King and Countrey; Hard
by, I saw a little furnace so candent glowing hot that it look'd
of the colour of a Rubie or <hi>Carbuncle,</hi> I was told that was to
clap in the Master of the Kings Jewell-house when he comes
thither, for being so perfidious and so perjurious to his Master;
I asked whether there were any other infernall tortures besides
<hi>fire,</hi> yes I was answered, for to speake of fire to a people habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated
to a cold clime, were not only to make them to slight
Hell, but to invite them to come to it; So my Spirit brought
me Northward a little, and shew'd me a huge lough, where
there were <hi>frosted</hi> mountaines up and down, and I might disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
among them a world of <hi>Blewcaps</hi> lying in beds of Ice with
their noses and toes nipt, the icesicles stucke to their fingers
ends like hornes, and a bleak hispid wind blew incessantly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, they made the most pitious noise that me thought
I heard in all Hell; for they wawld, screechd, and howld out
ever and anone this note, <hi>Weae is me, wea is me, that ever I betrayd
my gid King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Among all these damned soules, I desired to see what pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
an <hi>Atheist</hi> had: my Spirit answered me, there were
no Athiests in Hell at all, they were so on earth before they
came hither, and here they sensibly find and acknowledge there
is a God by his <hi>Iustice and Iudgement:</hi> For there is here <hi>paena
sensus,</hi> and <hi>paena damni;</hi> the outward torments you behold is not
so grievous as the inferiour regrets and agonies the soules have
to have lost Heaven, whereof they were once capable, and to be
eternally forsaken by their Creator; adde hereunto that they
know these torments to be endlesse, easelesse, and remedilesse:
Besides these qualities that are incident to the damned soules,
they have neither <hi>patience</hi> towards themselves in their owne
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:94590:9"/>
suffrances, nor <hi>pitty</hi> towards others, but their nature is
so accursed, that they wish their neighbors torments to be
greater then their own: Besides, their torments never lessen
either by tract of time or degree of sence, but they persever
alwaies the same; they are still fresh, and the soule able to
beare them. I saw that <hi>everlasting Villaine</hi> who committed
the first Sacrilege we read of, by burning <hi>Dianas</hi> Temple,
and his torments were as fresh and violent upon him as
they were the first day he was thrown in thither; <hi>Iudas</hi>
was in the same degree and strength of torture as the first
moment he fell thither; <hi>Iack Cade, Wat Tyler, Iack Straw Kit
the Tanner</hi> did fry there as fresh as they did that instant
they were cast thither: Amongst whom it made my heart
to melt within me to see some of their new-com'd Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treymen
amongst them, whereof I knew divers: And
though <hi>Society</hi> useth to be some <hi>solace</hi> to men in misery,
yet they conceived no comfort at all by these fresh com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions.</p>
            <p>It is high time for us now said my good guiding An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell
to be gone to the other world, so we directed our
course towards the Ferry upon <hi>Styx;</hi> Lord, what varities
of lurid, and ugly squalid countenances did I behold as
I passed! There was one sort of torment I had not seene
before, there were divers that hung by their tongues up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
posts up and down; I asked what they were, answer
was made, that they were English Divines, and Lawyers,
who against their <hi>Knowledge,</hi> as well as their <hi>Consciences,</hi>
did seduce the ignorant people of <hi>England</hi> in the late Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
Warre. A little further I might see abundance of
<hi>Committee-men</hi> and others, slopping up drops of moulten
lead in lieu of French-barley broath, with a rabble of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:94590:10"/>
sweeping the gutters of Hell, with brooms tufted
with Addars and Snakes, because they resorting to the
Wars, had thereby broke their Indentures with their
Masters, and their Oaths of Supremacy to their Prince.</p>
            <p>Passing then along towards the Ferry, a world of hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
shapes presented themselves unto me; there I saw
<hi>Corroding cares, panick feares, pining grief, lethargy, sleep,
ugly rebellion, revengefull malice, snakie discord, and spirituall
pride,</hi> the sin that first peopled Hell: Couches of Toads,
Adders, and Scorpions in a corner hard by, I ask'd for
whom they were prepared, I was answered, for some
English <hi>Evangelizing, Anabaptisticall, and Legislative La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi>
which make writing of Notes at Sermons, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
a meere vaile to cover their hypocrisie; So having
me thought by a miraculous providence charm'd <hi>Cerbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
by pointing at him with the signe of the Crosse upon
the fingers, we passed quietly by him, and being come
to the Ferry, I found true what <hi>Pluto</hi> had said before,
that there was a new English <hi>Tarpaulin</hi> entertained
by <hi>Charon,</hi> but he was in a most cruell torture, for his
body was covered thicke all over with Pitch and Tarre,
which burnt and flam'd round about him: And here the
<hi>Trance</hi> left me.</p>
            <p>Having thus come out of this sad swound, I began by
a serious recollection of my self to recall to my thoughts
those dismall and dreadfull objects that had appeared un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me; for though I was in Hell I did not taste of <hi>Lethe</hi>
all the while, so that I did not forget any thing that I had
seen; all things seem'd to appeare unto me so really, that
if I had been of that opinion (wherof many have been)
that Devills are <hi>nothing else but the ill affections, the exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
passions, and perturbances of the mind,</hi> it had been able
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:94590:10"/>
to have convinced me. The Reader may easily imagine
what apprehensions of horror these apparitions left in my
braine: For as a River being by an inundation swell'd out
of her wonted Channell leaves along the neighbouring
Medowes seggs and sands, and much riff-raff stuffe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
her upon her return to her former bed; So did this
<hi>Extasis,</hi> with that deluge of objects wherewith it over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm'd
my braine, leave behind it blacke sudds, and gastly
thoughts with in me, which have done me no hurt I thank
God for it, it being a true rule that <hi>Malum cognitum faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius
evitatur:</hi> And I wish they may produce the same
effects in the Reader as they did in the Author. VVe find
in the Sacred Oracles that <hi>Dives</hi> in his discourse from
Hell with <hi>Abraham,</hi> wish'd that some body might be sent
from the dead to informe and reclaime his Brothers upon
earth, because the words of a <hi>dead man</hi> would gaine more
credit with them then any others. Let the Readers of this
<hi>Trance</hi> make account that the Author was <hi>such a one;</hi> for
he hath been <hi>buried</hi> many years, and so let it work within
him accordingly.</p>
