         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Maſter <hi>Speaker,</hi>
               </salute>
            </opener>
            <p>VVEe ſit now upon that Grand buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the breaches of the Rights
and Priviledges of Parliament,
which are ſo many, and great, ſo
carefully preſerved, and defended, and having in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
times ſeverely puniſhed the infringers thereof,
that I had thought and conceived, that no Subject
of what degree or dignity ſoever, would either in
their own perſons, or by miſ-informing his Majeſty,
concerning the ſame, have preſumed to have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenched
in the leaſt meaſure upon the free Liberty,
Rights, and very being of Parliaments, tending to
the breach thereof. But Maſter <hi>Speaker,</hi> I perceive
the perverſeneſſe, and obſtinate frowardneſſe of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:152271:3"/>
perſons in this Kingdome, in places of power,
and authority, as well of the Clergy, as Layitie, are
growne to that height, that they dare not only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
to inſtigate, and provoke His ſacred Majeſty,
by their ſubtill and politicke miſ-informations, but
themſelves in their owne perſons dare attempt, if
His Majeſty in His royall wiſedome, tender care, and
affection towards his loyall ſubjects do refuſe to do
the ſame, to endeavour as much as in them lyes, by
their malignant carriages in Petitions, and Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to reſiſt the lawfull power, and undoubted
Iuriſdiction, both of the King, and his high Court
of Parliament.</p>
            <p>Maſter <hi>Speaker,</hi> Theſe men notwithſtanding, they
apparantly perceive that their wicked Practiſes, and
malicious Deſignes, cannot take effect according to
their expectation, but are rejected, and detected, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
by his Sacred Majeſty, as his Lords and his
whole Councell, dare aventure, to endeavour by caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
aſperſions, and ſpreading abroad evill reports,
not onely of the Members, but of the Proceedings
of the Houſe of Commons againſt them, and
others of their Adherents and Favourites, in their
wicked and deſperate actions and deſignes againſt
their lawfull Soveraigne, and his Liege people.</p>
            <p>I conceive Maſter <hi>Speaker,</hi> did theſe perſons, but
remember the many preſidents, yet extant of the
juſt and deſerved puniſhments inflicted by former
Parliaments upon ſuch miſcreants, as witneſſe the
Archbiſhop of <hi>Yorke,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Suffolke,</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:152271:3"/>
Chiefe Iuſtice <hi>Belknap,</hi> and the reſt of that conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy
in the raigne of K. <hi>Richard</hi> the 2. they would
have prejudicated to themſelves, the like danger
would follow upon them for their evill actions;
Nay Maſter <hi>Speaker,</hi> did theſe men but conſider with
themſelves, the juſt Iudgements of God, that have
immediately lighted upon the necks of ſuch, as have
beene the Troublers of Kingdomes and Common-wealths,
whereof they have beene members, as
well recorded in ſacred writ, as of late times in
this Kingdome, yet ſtill in freſh memory, they
would have laid their hands upon their mouths
and hearts, when they went about to ſpeake or doe
any thing tending to the diſhonour of Almighty
God, in innovating of his true Religion, corrupting
the ſincere Doctrine and Diſcipline of Chriſt and
his Apoſtles, as alſo any thing tending to the diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and perpetuall deſtruction of his Royall Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
and however, otherwiſe they may pretend
the fundamentall lawes and liberties of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
the rights and priviledges of Parliaments,
and the very being thereof: but ſurely Maſter <hi>Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi>
they are altogether benummed and ſtupified,
their conſciences dead and ſeered, their lives and
converſation altogether devoted to the workes of
darkeneſſe, and impurity; their deſires altogether
Senſuall, Carnall, and Diveliſh, forgetting God,
kicking and ſpurring with maliciouſneſſe againſt all
piety and godlineſſe, or elſe, they would never have
adventured to practiſe ſuch things, as it is too too
manifeſt they have done.</p>
            <p>Maſter <hi>Speaker,</hi> I intend to bee briefe in that, which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:152271:4"/>
I am to ſpeake concerning the breaches of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
of Parliament</p>
            <p>Firſt, to informe his Majeſty of any proceedings
in the Houſe of Commons upon any buſineſſe
whatſoever, before they have concluded, finiſhed
and made ready the ſame, to preſent to his Majeſty,
for his Royall aſſent, thereupon is a breach of the
priviledges of Parliament.</p>
            <p>Secondly, to miſ-informe his Majeſty contrary
to the proceedings in Parliament, thereby to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe
and provoke him againſt the ſame, is a breach
of priviledge of Parliament.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, to cauſe or procure any information or
accuſation to bee brought, or preferred without the
knowledge or conſent of the Parliament into the
Houſe, againſt any of the members thereof, is a
breach of priviledge of Parliament.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, to apprehend any ſuch accuſed, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon
their perſons, to ceaſe upon their goods or
eſtates, to proſecute and proceed againſt them to
their triall and judgement, to condemne or execute
them upon ſuch accuſation, without the conſent or
advice of the Parliament, is a breach of the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
thereof.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, to endeavour to caſt an evill opinion of
ſuch members accuſed into the hearts of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
loyall Subjects, whereby they diſ-affecting
them, may be ready and willing to put in execution
any command or warrant for their apprehenſion,
and impriſonment, is a breach of the priviledges
of Parliament.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, to come in open Parliament, for any Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:152271:4"/>
or Sergeant, to demand and arreſt any ſuch
member accuſed, be it of high Treaſon, or any other
crime whatſoever, without the knowledge of the
whole Houſe, is a breach of the priviledges of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, to come to a Parliament ſitting in free
conſultation, aſſiſted and guarded with Armed men,
and with them beſetting the Houſe, to demand
as it were (<hi>vi &amp; (armis</hi>) ſuch members accuſed, is a
breach of the priviledges of Parliament.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, to procure to be ſet forth, or to ſet forth
under His Majeſties name, any Proclamation, or
Declaration, prohibiting the repaire of ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
accuſed to the Parliament, as members thereof,
and to apprehend them in what place ſoever they
ſhall bee found, without the adviſe and conſent of
the whole State aſſembled, and ſitting in free Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
is a manifeſt breach of the priviledges thereof.
And this Maſter <hi>Speaker</hi> is all that I have to ſay,
concerning this dayes buſines, humbly
leaving the ſame to the further
conſideration of this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Aſſembly.</p>
