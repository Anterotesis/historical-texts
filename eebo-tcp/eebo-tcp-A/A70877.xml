            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I am verily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that the large Continent that <hi>Seneca</hi> propheſied of, is yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcovered, and remains to yeild us this honour, if we dare venture on it. I do not queſtion but that there are ſome will follow me in this my late famous enterprize; for whoſe grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter delight and encouragement, I have written this diſcovery, which I preſent to the world in this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Relation.</p>
            <p>After I had taken leave of my friends and acquaintance, I embark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>All winds Port,</hi> in a Ship called the <hi>Fancie:</hi> we ſay led very proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly for ſome days; at length we fell into a Current which our Pilots
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44301:10"/>
were not acquainted with; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unable to reſiſt its impetuoſity, we were hurried to a Land which had not yet been diſcovered. As ſoon as we had caſt anchor there, it being very ſecure riding all about, we ſent Captain <hi>Young</hi> on ſhore, with two of our beſt Souldiers, <hi>Merry man</hi> and <hi>Good fellow,</hi> to diſcover what they could of the Country: from whom after a ſhort ſpace for their return, we had this following Relation, That this new diſcovered part of the World was called <hi>Pſittacorum Regio,</hi> or, <hi>Womandecoia the ſhe-lands,</hi> which are in the Dominions of <hi>Prince de l' Amour,</hi> ſcituated towards the <hi>Cape of Good Hope,</hi> looking towards the <hi>Tropick of Capricorn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s;</hi> a Country repleniſhed with many <hi>Fountains of Orange flower water,</hi> and Trees whoſe heads are ever green; and ſuch a great quantity of <hi>Sweet William</hi> and <hi>Roſemary,</hi> that the very air is perfumed with it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:44301:10"/>That the Grounds were fertile enough, but badly <hi>Husbanded</hi> (it being pity it ſhould be otherwiſe, the men being ſo <hi>ſhrewdly wived</hi>) yet nevertheleſs, ſometimes they are more fruitful then the inhabitants deſire; for they bring forth before their time; and the fruit falling ſo plentifully before it is expected, doth cauſe very great differences, to the detriment and diſquiet of the Publick good.</p>
            <p>They acquainted us alſo, that before we could arrive at the <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,</hi> we muſt paſs through ſeveral Provinces, both large and rich, yet all of ſeveral Conditions, Habits and Languages.</p>
            <p>We could not but reſt ſatisfied with their intelligence; wherefore (after we had taken care and well provided for our Ship) and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our ſelves, we reſolved to try our various Adventures. For my part, I ſo depended upon their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:44301:11"/>
that I could not otherwiſe then believe that the Country was rather pleaſant then dangerous; in ſomuch that I travelled ſo far into it without any conduct, that I mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtook my way, but at laſt fortunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcovered a ſtrange Province called <hi>Gluttonia (High dyet</hi> being an introducer into <hi>Laſciviania</hi>) which is alſo in <hi>Prince de l' Amours</hi> Dominions.</p>
            <p>The ſoyl of this Province is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily admirable, the Air delicately temperate. O how it pitied me, that ſo bad Husbandmen ſhould poſſeſs ſo fruitful and pleaſant a habitation! In Latitude it lyeth full thirty two degrees, and in Longitude forty four: it joyns to <hi>Quaffonia,</hi> where they ſpeak the ſame language, and are ſcituate in the ſame Longitude and Latitude: they have both one Prince, one Law; and a happy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation (if there could be ſuch a one) would make them concur both
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:44301:11"/>
in Prince, Law, Habit and Manners. The <hi>She-Landreſſes</hi> of <hi>Woman-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coia</hi> traffique much hither, but more to <hi>Laſciviania,</hi> where (when there is a truce between them and that Province) they uſe to make exchange by bartering of Chriſtalline Glaſſes for Unguents and Pomanders.</p>
            <p>To avoid prolixity, I ſhall here chiefly diſcourſe of the preſent cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms and manners of the Natives of this Country. Every Month they are bound by their Law (and would be ſo, were there no Law) to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate a ſolemn Feaſt, where every <hi>Aldergut</hi> of the whole Society muſt preſent himſelf, all excuſes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays whatſoever ſet a part, to conſult (after dinner; for before, it is unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for any one to give his voice) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the publick good. The place where they meet is <hi>Gurmonds-Hall:</hi> every one knoweth his ſeat, and hath his <hi>Jourdan</hi> or Chamber-pot ſtanding by him, in a little Coffer
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44301:12"/>
made for the purpoſe. Well, being met, and having turned their Wine into Water, and their Oyſters into Shells; every one takes his Chair, and to dinner they go. Their dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieſt diſhes are evermore the firſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices unto their ſtomacks: for they hold that the beſt meat meeteth fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt with the beſt appetite. Now they do not count it convenient, as to their appetites, in any caſe to have their Boars, Sheep, Goats, Lambs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſerved up in parcels and joynts, as we of <hi>Europe</hi> uſe; but they muſt have all whole, (the old <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> taught them that:) you ſhall ſee the Waiters come ſweating with a whole Hog, or an whole Calf, upon a great pewter Engine, you would bleſs your ſelf to behold it. He that riſeth before ſix hours are fully run, incurs a moſt rigorous Fine: and after this, for a while they eat and drink by little and little onely (for that cauſe that made <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſite

               <hi>Philoxenus</hi> wiſh himſelf the neck of a Crane) to take the more delight in the delicacies. But for the breaking up of the Feaſt, they obſerve this order: They have a door in their Hall, large enough for the greateſt <hi>Gut-monger</hi> that lives, take him faſting: at this door they all enter, when they come to the Feaſt; which being ended, he that offers to paſs the ſame way that he came, and cannot get his belly tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, is let forth another way: but he that paſſeth as eaſily as he came in, is ſtaid by an Officer appointed for that purpoſe, called the <hi>Serjeant</hi> of the <hi>Maw,</hi> and brought back again, (will he, nill he) where he muſt ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle himſelf to a new <hi>Collation,</hi> until his belly be able to kiſs both the cheeks of the door at once; and then he is diſmiſſed. (I cannot be fully perſwaded, but the creeping through Saint <hi>Wilfrids</hi> Needle, which was whilom to be ſeen in
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:44301:13"/>
               <hi>Bever-Caſtle,</hi> was a device brought by ſome ancient Pilgrim, from this more ancient cuſtom.) Nay, mark but whether theſe men have not a care of the Cities credit. They have a common Hoſpital (and that I'll aſſure you a large one) wherein all ſuch as have got the Dropſie, the Gout, the Cough of the Lungs, or any ſuch malady by too much eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, are maintain'd at the publick charge. But all ſuch as have loſt their Teeth by age, or by ſupping their Broth too hot, are forthwith provided for conveniently, and ſent away into <hi>Spoon-meat-Iſlands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moſt of theſe Citizens are of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſurable groſneſs (and ſeemed to me when I ſaw them, to walk much like ſo many tuns, moving each up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Pottle-pots:) nor is that man worthy of their meaneſt ſalutation, that is not all cheeks to the belly, and all belly to the feet; like him whoſe Epitath this was:</p>

            </lg>
            <p>And ſuch ſhapes do the Women of this City walk in alſo: (the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Towns</hi> do pretty well in imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theſe <hi>Great Boſſes;</hi> but the <hi>Barbarians</hi> come very neer them) the young Women may not marry till ſuch time, as before a Bench of Matrons, they make a publick de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration to their Husbands that ſhall be, that their Dugs and Chins may meet without any forcing of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. They go for the moſt part all naked, onely the <hi>Alder-guts</hi> may wear Gowns; marry, thoſe muſt be onely the Skins of ſuch Beaſts as they are able to devour alone at one ſitting. Yet there is no Freeman of the Town, but wears a large Knife, and a Spoon as big as a Ladle bound
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:44301:14"/>
to his right arm. Before, upon his breſts, each one weareth a poke of Hair-cloth, to ſave what otherwiſe may fall beſides, and to wipe their mouths withal; but thoſe they uſe ſo long in this greaſie imploy ment, that whether their ſhining exceed their blackneſs, or their blackneſs their ſhining, he had need to be well ſighted that ſhould diſtinguiſh. They are naturally dull of wit, and ſlow of apprehenſion; and yet, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, moſt perfect in all the Arts they reſpect. Their Schools have no Lectures read in them, but onely <hi>Apicius his Institutions of the Art of Muncherie:</hi> and there all the young Fry are taught the Sciences of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, Chewing and Swallowing: Oh moſt profoundly! The <hi>Gluttonian</hi> Lecturer (when I was there) was one <hi>Doctor Full-Gorge,</hi> a man moſt rare in his Profeſſion; and inſtead of <hi>Grammar,</hi> he read the firſt Section of the aforeſaid Inſtitutions of <hi>Api<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius.</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:44301:14"/>
Their Library is a large room, ranked full of Pots, Kettles, Spits, and belly-Utenſils of all ſorts, every ſort being enſeamed in their ſeveral <hi>Claſſes:</hi> the Scholars have alſo each one his full Pot, and his laden Platter, for his book: the Freſhmen have leſſer meaſures, the Sophiſters larger, and ſo up to the <hi>Graduats.</hi> The firſt, perhaps, hath his Pint and his Pullet; the next, his Quart and his Gooſe; the third, his Pottle and Quarter of Lamb, or his Gammon of Bacon; and ſo upwards: nor may any leave his task, or have leave to play, till he have made an end of what was injoyned him. If one ſtay ſeven years in theſe Schools, and benefit nothing, he is, forſooth, baniſhed for ever into <hi>Starveling-Iſles,</hi> to <hi>Hungerland</hi> is he ſent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, to dyet upon <hi>Spaniſh</hi> dinners, furniſhed with half Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers.

On the Eaſt part it is ſtrongly fortified with Barrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does and Bulwarks of <hi>Barrels,</hi> and the Roofs of the Houſe are moſt of one and the ſame manner, covered with the boards of broken Casks: In the entrance of the Gates, from morning until night, there is placed a double Cannon of <hi>Pewter</hi> (for their Law commandeth this to be duly obſerved) the Citizens call it the <hi>Flaggon of Hoſpitality;</hi> and round about it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are theſe words in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven, <hi>Aut bibe, aut abi; Drink or be gone.</hi> He that arriveth muſt either drink it all off, or elſe he is carried before the Magiſtrate, to render an accompt of his Contumacy.

            <p>I had a great deſire to ſee the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of their publick Feaſts, and yet not to be ſeen by the Citizens. So my Comrade at laſt agreed to per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>form my requeſt, and to ſatisfie my longing; indeed he gave me withal certain cautions of danger, that I

By and by came the <hi>Quaffonians,</hi> juſt as the <hi>Glottonians</hi> do, onely they had more drink, and leſs meat.

            <p>At firſt, they begin a ſacrifice to <hi>Bacchus,</hi> their General God: not as the <hi>Romans</hi> did of old, with pouring a little Wine upon the ground; no, no, far more religiouſly, and with more ſtately Ceremonies.

While theſe Songs were

At the beginning of their Feaſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they generally have (as hath been ſaid) very ſlippery memories, quickly forgetting what they do,

they have a publick Notary, whom they call <hi>Clerk of the Winde-pipe,</hi> who is appointed to Regiſter every particular Carouſe, and ſo files them up for common Records, what each man hath drunk, and unto whom; which done, after the Feaſt he reads them to the Company, (if any be awake to hear them.)

a long Pilgrimage unto Saint <hi>Borachio</hi> of <hi>Bottlesbrook.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I wondered at this new name, and this as yet undiſcovered Pilgrimage; ſo I queſtioned him at large of the Country, of this Towns ſituation and diſcipline; and finally, of the Vertues of this <hi>Borachio. Bottles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brook,</hi> Sir, ſaid he, is ſeated in the confines of <hi>Hot-watrea,</hi> and <hi>Laſcivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ania,</hi> and is of great fame through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out both the Soyls. Beſides divers other ancient Monuments in the Town, there is a Temple of <hi>Bacchus Fiery face,</hi> they call it the <hi>Cappel-Ardent,</hi> where a rich and rare Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his is erected, not like a grown man, but very youthful, juſt as his Father took him from the burning Womb of <hi>Semele;</hi> ſo it is, having been long ago ſo cut out of the hard Rock of Rubies. The top of this Temple is all ſet with Carbuncles, and golden Sparks, moſt rich to behold; and from the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:44301:31"/>
embowed Arch there drops, they ſay, a kinde of hot fuming Liquor (as <hi>Cataracts</hi> do in ſome places of <hi>Mardelzur,</hi> as <hi>Hackluit</hi> affirms in his Voyages, and is received into a <hi>Borachio</hi> that ſtands placed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly; whoſe Vertue is ſuch, that if one drink a large draught of it with good devotion, he ſhall never in his life after be either drunk before noon, or athirſt before midnight: both which helps may do me much good; for I am a man ſo imployed in my Country, that I can never lye in my bed until midnight for thirſt; nor never riſe before noon, but I am drunk and faſt a ſleep again. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have I gone theſe three days without drinking at all (ſave that I drunk one diſh of water this morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) becauſe I would merit the more of this holy St. <hi>Borachio,</hi> when I come there; nor dares any man im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune me to drink, or any in my company, as long as I wear this

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> intreated both his company and patronage. Well, we went chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on until I obſerved the Soyl altered; wherefore I asked him, where we now were.

quoth I, being very weary, Whither go we now? is not this <hi>Bottles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brook?</hi> O Lord, no, he replyed; but cheer up your ſelf, we have but, in compariſon, a foot of ground till we are there; we are onely to trample a little over the pleaſant ſhores of <hi>Hot-watrea,</hi> and we ſhall preſently arrive at <hi>Bottlesbrook.</hi> But whence, ſaid I, is that ſmoak? he replyed, It comes out of <hi>Mount Denis,</hi> wherein the ſouls of ſuch as either lived too ſoberly, or killed themſelves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperately, are purified by fire; and there they burn, until ſome of their living friends go in Pilgrimage to <hi>Chappel-Ardent</hi> for a Bottle of Saint <hi>Borachio</hi>'s water; and pouring that upon their Tomb, they are freed. I ſmiled at this, and thought now ſurely I have found the Original of Purgatory: let <hi>Abbot Odilo,</hi> and his Monks of <hi>Coruna</hi> tell me never ſo many tales of Mount <hi>Aetna,</hi> and ſo many good-morrows, 'tis here
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:44301:33"/>
thought I, or 'tis nowhere.</p>
            <p>Well, at length we arrived at <hi>Bottlesbrook:</hi> in truth I found it to be a pretty ſweet Town; marry it was both paved with Bottles, and roofed with Lethern-bougets. <hi>I</hi> do not remember that <hi>I</hi> ſaw any Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer in all the Town, but Lethern Jack-makers. The reaſon is, the men of this Country uſe no pure Wine, as the other <hi>Drink-alls</hi> do, but certain diſtilled waters mixed with the ſtrongeſt Grapes they can get; which are ſo violently hot, that the brittle Glaſs cannot hold them, and therefore they are forced to fortiſie their Bottles with Lethern Jerkins, rivited together with Pitch and Rozen.</p>
            <p>We travelled on through many craggy and fenny paſſages, till at laſt we arrived at a Port called <hi>Puerto d' Aqua forte,</hi> the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of which place drink <hi>Brand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fireal,</hi> by moſt of them for brevity

called <hi>Brandewine,</hi> ſquezed from the ſowreſt Grapes, which the <hi>French</hi> (rather then they would throw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way) thought it more convenient to make a more profitable traſtique of. Some ſay the <hi>Dutchlanders,</hi> to diſperſe the unwholeſome Fogs which ariſe from their Seas, ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en and fortifie their ſtomacks with this tipple, which I alſo found here, (how they came by it in theſe parts I know not) but this I am ſure, that it is with them <hi>A-la-modo,</hi> luſtily quaft off. The Yeomen of theſe <hi>Brandy</hi>-bottles here are fiery faced, cholerick of condition, of a ſtagger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manner of pace in their going: but that which is moſt terrible of all, they drink, and they breath nothing but elemental ſire, meer flames.

            <p>As ſoon as theſe cruel Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſes had taken me upon the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of <hi>Laſciviania,</hi> they brought me away (as <hi>I</hi> have ſaid) to this their chief City, where they towl'd a Bell, and preſently all the <hi>Petti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coat-Inhabitants</hi> came flocking thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a trice, and began to prie more narrowly upon me, who ſtood bound ſure enough (God wot) for offering them any falſe meaſure.

At length one of the rout, (their <hi>Captainneſs</hi> it ſeems ſhe was) gave a ſign to the reſt to be ſilent (as ſhe had need) and then ſhe thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpake the Company; What, or of whence this fellow is, <hi>I</hi> do not know, onely we took him in the confines of yonder damned Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of our Enemies, <hi>Laſciviania;</hi> and ſeeing they have offered us ſo much injury, <hi>I</hi> hold it very fit now (if it be not too late) to take revenge of them, and firſt with this priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:44301:39"/>
is very fruitful: it is divided into many Provinces, both large and wealthy: The principal of them are theſe: <hi>Fattingen, Scoldonna, Blubberick, Giglot-angir,</hi> the high and low; <hi>Cockatrixia, Shreweſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg,</hi> and <hi>Blackswanstack,</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe called <hi>Modeſtiana.</hi> Not far from theſe is an Iſland, called <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maphrodite,</hi> or <hi>Double-Sex:</hi> many of theſe Provinces <hi>I</hi> did paſs through, when <hi>I</hi> was carryed Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to <hi>Goſſipingoa.</hi> But to ſpeak truth, <hi>Fattingen,</hi> or the <hi>Land of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rots,</hi> is the beſt Country of them all, and hath many fair Cities in it, as <hi>Pratingople, Talesborne,</hi> and <hi>Lips<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wagg;</hi> through the laſt of which there runneth a great River, called <hi>Silver Streams,</hi> which ſometimes will overflow the banks, and drown all the lower parts of the Country, which they call <hi>Chinnedale;</hi> but the Countrymen have now deviſed very ſtrong Rampiers to keep it from
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:44301:39"/>
breaking out any more, but when they liſt to let it out a little now and then for clearing of the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel.</p>
            <p>As touching their forms of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, they are allowed of for a Free State by <hi>Prince de l' Amour</hi> (queſtionleſs the kindeſt Prince of the world to Women, and the moſt unlikelieſt to debar them of their liberties) their Government being ruder and differing from his, the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in his Country being more courtly and civilized; and if other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, upon any diſlike ſent hither, where they need not to queſtion their welcome entertainment: For here, for ought I could perceive, each one ſeeks Superiority, and would be ſo popular, as to avoid o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. They have no Laws at all, doing every thing by the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Voices. But the giving up of their Voices, ſtruck me into a wonder, being unacquainted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:44301:40"/>
for they ſet up a cry all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; none gives <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ar, but each one yells, as if ſhe were horn-mad; and is not this able to abaſh a milde mans ſpirit? They hold a continual Parliament (if the word ſignifies ſo, as it is rendred in their conſultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) onely to prattle about their affairs of State; ſo that <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> as he had in part already done in his <hi>Colloquies,</hi> would be able to give a ſtronger teſtimony of Womens turning Suitors. Now this conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance is neceſſary, becauſe of their Laws uncertainty: for the decrees of this day, are altered or diſanulled to morrow; but the ſame day they cannot, leſt their Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>givers ſhould ſeem to be inconſtant in their Edicts. Every ones voice is alike in worth, the City of <hi>Goſſipingoa</hi> through, but not every ones dignity, for they have a ſet number of choſen women, they call them <hi>Graveſſes;</hi> and theſe have the Authority of moſt Honour
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:44301:40"/>
in each particular City: but they are not born to this dignity, but are elected, either for their Beauty, or their Eloquence; for by theſe two are all Elections ordered. They had once a cuſtom to elect theſe <hi>Graveſſes</hi> by voices, but afterwards every one giving her voice but onely for her ſelf, it bred a confuſion, and ſo made them to aboliſh that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Election: and then they drew a Decree, that thoſe onely ſhould have the ſway in this ſame envious contention, who would profeſs themſelves neither to be Fair nor Eloquent: But this brought all to ſuch a paſs, that in the whole Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of them, you ſhould not finde one that would be <hi>Electreſſes;</hi> the elder ſort holding that they had the Eloquence, and the younger ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as firm in it that they had the Beauty. At length they all agreed to paſs over theſe places of <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctreſſes</hi> unto twelve of the moſt aged
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:44301:41"/>
Matrons of old <hi>Mumpington</hi> (a ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inous Village hard by) and ſo they did, giving them the moſt glorious Titles of <hi>Electreſſes Graveſial:</hi> The chief of whom, when I was there were theſe, the Dutcheſs of <hi>Cackle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tout,</hi> the Counteſs of <hi>Banne alleyla,</hi> the Arch-presbytereſs of <hi>Slaver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpreg,</hi> the <hi>Palatine</hi> of <hi>Twittle-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tattle,</hi> and eight more ſubordinate Electreſſes. To ſet them the more agog to their charges, they are ſtrangely adored, and wonderfully curſified. And beſides this honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſtile, <hi>The reverend of the age,</hi> wealth and abundance comes in flowing continually upon them; for the ambitious young Wenches will ſo bribe and ply them with gifts, to have their voices at the day of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, that I hold that there is not a Court more corrupt in giving voices, or more wealthy in getting of riches. Inſtead of Scepters and Swords, the <hi>Graveſſes</hi> have Fans
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:44301:41"/>
and Glaſſes born before them, huge Chriſtal Glaſſes; and ſtill as they paſs through the ſtreets, they prank up their attires by the ſaid Glaſſes, (and looſe no time) but ſet all their gew-gaws in order as they go along.</p>
            <p>There are a few <hi>Shee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>landreſſes</hi> born in this Nation, but moſt of them being, as we ſaid, of the unci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viler ſort of Females, are excluded out of <hi>Prince de l' Amours</hi> Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; ſuch as will either wear their Husbands Breeches, or elſe ſuch as their Husbands jealouſie will baniſh, thoſe are ſent in flocks hither. Now all ſuch as are their Husbands Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and are therefore baniſhed upon the unjuſt claim unto Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty; theſe are aſſigned to inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite the Frontiers of the <hi>Shee-lands,</hi> eſpecially in the Countries of <hi>Shrewesbourg;</hi> and there they are all put in Garriſon. But as for thoſe that are voluntary Exiles, they are
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:44301:42"/>
generally of meek and unmanly ſpirits; and theſe are ſeated in the heart of the Land, to become Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tareſſes to <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Beauty;</hi> and yet you need never dream that this Weal-publick (however weakly founded) ſhould go to ruine for want of particular Members: and I will tell you why, there are ſo many Volunteers, (eſpecially free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women) come to this Camp, that the fear is rather that there will want room for the new Inhabitants, then otherwiſe. Truely, I am in great perplexity leſt my Countrywomen (though they are uſed ſo well here) ſhould have any underſtanding of this State: for if they have, we may go ſnick-up for any Female that will abide amongſt us; but all will away, we ſhould not have one big belly left to lay the Foundation for a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture age by.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Goſſipingoa,</hi> I got (beſides my Freedom) the Cities Letters for my

I was not many Leagues from <hi>Loveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> the firſt Town of this Country, when I entred into an Air as deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cately ſeated, as if the Perfumers in <hi>England</hi> had lately play'd their prizes therefor eternal Soveraignty; the whole Country round about it is ſo ſtufft with Apothecaries and <hi>Pomandrificoes:</hi> The reſt I omit, as I look upon theſe as the chief <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificoes</hi> of this State. The women of this Country are generally tall, gracefully adorned; and (were it not that they practice the Art of <hi>Sneek-oyling</hi> over much) we might imagine them handſome. They wear nothing on their faces, nor on their breſts: as for the reſt of their habit, it is fair in ſhew, light in weight, and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:44301:43"/>
eaſie to mount. I travelled hard, till at laſt I arrived at a Province named <hi>Shameſgrave,</hi> (for ſo they call the Shire-town of <hi>Giglot-angyr,</hi> where it is reported that the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre of <hi>Modeſty</hi> lyes. Here their houſes are made all of <hi>Muſcovia</hi> Glaſſes, as tranſparent as Air: where it is labour loſt to ſeek any of them at home, unleſs you make your inqueſt immediately upon their dreſſing time, or ſomewhat before: But lay your plot to ſeek them in a Playhouſe, or in a Tavern, or ſo, and it ſtands upon a good Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for there you are ſure to find your Female, either a laughing, a ſinging, or ſome extraordinary im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment. You never ſaw Spider contrive a more artificial Net for a Flie, then theſe women do for the <hi>Laſcivianians</hi> (however their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries deadly Enemies) yet ſome of theſe men ſerve their deſires as Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunteers for provant and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:44301:43"/>
Others they lay their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſhes for, and fetch them in firſt by looſe Allurements, then by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and then by pence; and if none of theſe means will work, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel them to ſerve their wanton de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires by force. And when they have done ſo, juſt as your Stallion Horſes are kept for breed, ſo are they ſtowed into cuſtody, dieted with <hi>Eringo's, Potato's, Culliſſes,</hi> and other deviſed diſhes, until <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> ſends her ſecond ſummons.

And all their own Nation that have not ſhewn themſelves perfect, both in begetting, and bringing forth, are made ſlaves to the reſt: and when they take any that are but ſimply of one Sex, you would admire what a coyl they keep about them, as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digies and Monſters, as we do thoſe that are born double-headed, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch deformed births.

For ſeeing Nature, ſay they, hath beſtowed two hands, two feet, two eyes, two ears, and two noſtrils to every mans perfect body; why ſhould not the moſt perfect Creature of all be perfect in two Sexes alſo?

Thus are they wont to perfect their deformities: and truely you may obſerve in them all, beſides their ſhapes, both mans wit, and a womans craft.

            <p>The women ſit at meat, and the men attend; the women ſleep when they pleaſe, and the men watch; ſo do they ſcold and fight, whilſt the men are fain to bear off, with ears, head and ſhoulders.</p>

Well, but (you will ask) what is the end of all this ceremonious obſervation? By my troth a ridiculous one, able to move the gentleſt ſpleen alive; they are all ſingularly and ingeniouſly Coney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catcht, men and women, rarely fetcht over, and with Arts quinteſſence: and yet for all that, this Art is ſo ſecret, that though no man paſs this trial, that is not made an Aſs; yet every one had rather blame his own ſlothfulneſs and incredulity, or elſe believe that he had committed ſome

miſtake, rather then ſo much as once to glance at any imperfection in the power of the Goddeſs. Well, having propounded your petition, (ſuppoſe it be Honour) the Goddeſs aſſents to it moſt graciouſly, commanding the ſuppliant firſt, after ſome hours, to take a potion, whereby his ſpirit may be the better adapted to the enſuing felicity; and then to lay him down again until ſhe call him the ſecond time: which if he do but rightly obſerve, he ſhall aſſuredly (as they ſay) be crowned with his full wiſhes, to continue enſtalled in happineſs for ever, and to have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the ſame cauſe to be grateful to the Goddeſs for her heavenly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence.</p>

            <p>The <hi>Mystery of Folly</hi> in three Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes; the firſt is the <hi>Simpletons</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs; the ſecond is the Introducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

            <p>The trick to frizzle and curle the hair according to the features of the face.</p>

            <p>The invention how with a little coſt to gain much honour.</p>

            <p>Within this City there are places ordained for <hi>Fine Petticoat-Skirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes,</hi> and <hi>gilded Chariot-Turnaments.</hi> Now <hi>fine Petticoats</hi> are certain kinde of <hi>Animals</hi> that have neither feet nor teeth, but yet are very coſtly.

As for gilded Chariots &amp; Coaches, they are <hi>pretty Engines</hi> to trundle wealthy <hi>Amoro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo's</hi> and <hi>Amoretta's</hi> about in. Theſe have ſometimes four Beaſts to draw them without, and half a dozen Butter-Flies riding within. The firſt that enter <hi>Maiae's</hi> Park, are not always the happieſt, but rather the laſt; for theſe being freed from the throng, they may the better execute their brave deſigns, advance, retreat, thruſt forward, caſt flaming Darts without burning, diſcharge Piſtols without noiſe; amongſt which many other of the City-Coaches are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to exerciſe, which though they

make not ſo much noiſe, do as good execution, and many times come off and on with as great applauſe. In fine, amongſt all their ordinary di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſements, this Myſtery is the moſt publick, and yet the leaſt underſtood; and thoſe which cannot unriddle their winks and nods, and the Stenography of their black patches, their ſmiles and other ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile geſticulations, will take it onely for a confuſed noiſe and throng of Coaches, able to cauſe the <hi>Meagri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Ladies of this Court, as of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, do not all of them affect the ſame ways; for ſome climb over the <hi>Mountains</hi> of <hi>Advancement,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers creep under the <hi>Hedge</hi> of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi> and <hi>Toleration;</hi> but moſt love the cloſe way of ſecret ſolitude, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Beſides theſe ſtrange Cattle, there were thoſe that would force you
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:44301:83"/>
(whether you would or no) to look and gaze upon them; theſe were called the <hi>beſmeared ones,</hi> of which there are three ſorts; the White-Plaiſterers, the Red-Painters, and the Varniſh-Daubers, which laſt Flye the Sun as much as the other ſhun the Rain. Some of theſe their naked parts are ſo croſſed over with over-groſs paintings (as they uſe in <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſcovia</hi>) that you would imagine you ſaw ſome Statue or <hi>Weſtminſter-Tomb,</hi> rather then a living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; ſuch a Cart-load of falſe colours enſconce their faireſt beauties.</p>
            <p>To draw to a concluſion; amongſt theſe Ladies there are the <hi>Admirable ones,</hi> which nevertheleſs have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be admired of them, but the name. And then the <hi>Precious ones,</hi> which at preſent were very common and cheap.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Raviſhing ones,</hi> that commit more rapes upon the purſe then the hearts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:44301:83"/>There are alſo the <hi>Perplexed ones,</hi> that have ſtill ten plots in their heads, and twenty Gallants at their heels. Together with the little <hi>Mincing Minions,</hi> which ordinarily have as ſlender wits as waſtes.</p>
            <p>There were ſome alſo that have the titles of Saints, right Saint-<hi>touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me-not,</hi> that would ſeem to be meer <hi>Platonick Idea's,</hi> which refuſe all before the World, and deny nothing in a corner; <hi>Cum multis aliis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Air of this Country is ſo tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate and wholeſome, that one ſeldom hears of any great maladies there; and if an <hi>Amoretta</hi> findes but the leaſt change in her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, as any apparent redneſs, or the like, ſhe makes her complaints to all the World, as if it were a moſt grievous out-rage that Nature had committed againſt Love: nor are they hindred from keeping their beds, provided that it be for ſome advantage to diverſifie their game,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:44301:84"/>
or any other intereſt, which experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence alone can teach them.</p>
            <p>But indeed there is nothing more delightful to behold in all this City, then the <hi>Flying-hearts,</hi> of which it is very full: they are covered with Flames and large Wings; and 'tis to be admired their Flames are ſo moderate, they do not ſcorch their Plumes: they court all the Ladies they meet, and tell them fine things in their ears; but are not much ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eitious, whether they be reſpected or diſdained: theſe are a Sect by themſelves, whoſe Founder, 'tis ſaid, was one certain <hi>Hylas;</hi> they have taken the Hiſtory of <hi>Inconſtant Lovers</hi> for their <hi>Directory,</hi> and their Motto is, <hi>Qui plus en aime, plus aime:</hi> in one and the ſame converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they pearch upon one Ladies ſhoulders, on anothers head, in a thirds lap; and are ſo tame, that they may eaſily be taken by any fair ones hand: they do homage to this
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:44301:84"/>
Ladies Eyes, to that Ladies Hair, and pay tribute to their lips and breaſts: they flye at all, and ſtay with none; laugh at every Lady, and are ſcofft at again; for theſe <hi>Flying-hearts</hi> can laugh as well as ſpeak.</p>
            <p>Expect not here (gentle Reader) any exacter deſcription of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, either of how I found it, or how I left it: you may better inform your ſelves, if you pleaſe but to take pains to give it ſuch a viſit as I did: if at your arrival there you do not ſinde theſe Countries, as I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed them to you, blame not any defect in me: for their forms of Government are ſo continually al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, that one may deſcribe ye the ſhape of <hi>Proteus,</hi> or the colour of a <hi>Chamaelion,</hi> or tell ye what weather it will be to morrow, ſooner then tender you any true knowledge of their diſcipline. For my part, I give the <hi>Portugals</hi> free leave to brag
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:44301:85"/>
of their travels and large diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; I reached to the hight of my ambition, when with ſafety I ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted my Native Soyl. Farewel.</p>
