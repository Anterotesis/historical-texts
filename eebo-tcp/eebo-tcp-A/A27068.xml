            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="4">IV. DioceÅ¿an Churches are of three Å¿orts. 1.

And to dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿h from his Law (which hath a CurÅ¿e.)</p>
            <p>The third Å¿ort of DioceÅ¿ans, is either 1. of a DioceÅ¿s (like a great PariÅ¿h with Chappels) Å¿o Å¿mall that one PaÅ¿tor may poÅ¿Å¿ibly overÅ¿ee it.

To be obedient to a DioceÅ¿an, is no Å¿uch Renunciation. Therefore it is no Å¿uch Renunciation to promiÅ¿e to obey them in lawful things, Å¿ubordinate to obeying ChriÅ¿t. If it prove a <hi>miÅ¿take</hi> in them, and that they owe no Å¿uch Obedience, every Å¿uch miÅ¿take doth not degrade them.

            <p n="2">2. To take DioceÅ¿ans to be <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> is Å¿aid by Å¿ome to be <hi>deÅ¿tructive</hi> of the <hi>PaÅ¿toral Office,</hi> and Churches, and a change of the <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi> Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

But no Law determined for any of theÅ¿e alone. UnleÅ¿s you will Å¿ay, the Preface to the Book of Ordination doth it, by Å¿aying [<hi>It is evident to all men diligently reading holy Scripture, and Ancient Authors, that from the ApoÅ¿tles time, there have been</hi> theÅ¿e Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders <hi>of MiniÅ¿ters in ChriÅ¿ts Church, BiÅ¿hops, PrieÅ¿ts, and Deacons.

            <p>Here Å¿ome Å¿ay, That the Church of <hi>England</hi> took not theÅ¿e for three diÅ¿tinct Orders before 1640, but now: Therefore by the word [<hi>theÅ¿e Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>] is meant only <hi>two.</hi>

            <p>Indeed <hi>Aelfricks</hi> Laws in <hi>Spelman,</hi> make BiÅ¿hops and PrieÅ¿ts the Å¿ame Order, and Å¿o do a great part of Schoolmen and other PapiÅ¿ts; but the <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi> BiÅ¿hops and Clergy were Å¿ome of one mind, and Å¿ome of another about it, and determined it not. UnleÅ¿s this Preface be a Determination, the Name [<hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Office</hi>] being both uÅ¿ed.</p>
            <p>And (to inÅ¿tance in no other) <hi>Saravia</hi> (tho no <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi> man, yet of the Church of <hi>England</hi>) wrote more Å¿trongly almoÅ¿t than any that I ever read, for DioceÅ¿an EpiÅ¿copacy (againÅ¿t <hi>Beza,</hi> &amp;c.) and that upon this ground of <hi>Divine right,</hi> that they <hi>Å¿ucceeded the ApoÅ¿tles,</hi> and Å¿uch as <hi>Timothy, Titus,</hi> &amp;c. in the Government of many Churches. (And the Kings Divines at the IÅ¿le of <hi>White</hi> went all on that Ground).</p>
            <p>To Å¿ay then, that to plead a <hi>Divine right</hi> for them, is <hi>new,</hi> is to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict large HiÅ¿torical Evidences. And were it true, that this had been never before ImpoÅ¿ed or SubÅ¿cribed; Å¿urely it is not an Opinion of the Divine right of <hi>governing</hi> of many Churches, that renounceth the <hi>being</hi> of thoÅ¿e Churches; it <hi>aÅ¿Å¿erteth them</hi> to be by <hi>Divine right.</hi> For that which is <hi>not,</hi> is not <hi>governable. Non entis, non Å¿unt accidentia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But where and how hath the Law or Church altered the caÅ¿e Å¿ince 1640. TheÅ¿e words were in the Book of Ordination before, and I know of none plainer that way Å¿ince. Its <hi>deÅ¿tructive DioceÅ¿an</hi> Government, which

renounceth the Government of any Å¿ubject Churches, but of one only, and of any PaÅ¿tors that I argue againÅ¿t, and not <hi>Governours</hi> of Å¿uch Churches.</p>
            <p n="34">XXXIV. But it's objected, <hi>That they Å¿wear</hi> [<hi>not to endeavour any altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Church-Government; therefore they renounce the PaÅ¿toral Office, becauÅ¿e the preÅ¿ent Government excludeth it.</hi>

            <p n="3">3. Their SubÅ¿cription <hi>never to endeavour alteration,</hi> engageth them never to endeavour to deÅ¿troy the PariÅ¿h Churches and MiniÅ¿try, and Å¿o is <hi>for them</hi>: For that would be a great alteration indeed.</p>

ReaÅ¿on and Church-conÅ¿ent among theÅ¿e, made one a PreÅ¿ident over the reÅ¿t, and called him the BiÅ¿hop pecularly, (if it were in <hi>Marks</hi> days, as <hi>Hierom</hi> Å¿aith, it was in <hi>John</hi>'s). And tho this be not eÅ¿Å¿ential to a Church, it is lawful, and fit; and at laÅ¿t it grew to Å¿o great a Reputation and Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of neceÅ¿Å¿ity, that all Churches had Å¿uch BiÅ¿hops, and gave them a Negative voice, and ordained not without them, and defined Churches as eÅ¿Å¿entiated by Relation to them, <hi>EccleÅ¿ia eÅ¿t plebs EpiÅ¿copo adunata.</hi> If now Å¿uch men as <hi>J.O.</hi> Mr. <hi>Nye,</hi> Dr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> &amp;c.

The Heathen Country might be his DioceÅ¿s, but not his Church. The converted ChriÅ¿tians got into Å¿everal MonaÅ¿teries, and not into PariÅ¿h-Churches.

And our preÅ¿ent Canons Å¿ince 1604, tho they null not the Parochial PaÅ¿torÅ¿hip, do Å¿o far reÅ¿train it, as I hope my ConÅ¿cience Å¿hall never approve. But yet, for that I will not forÅ¿ake what is of God, nor make mans failings a pretence againÅ¿t my duty to God and Man, to the Violation of Love, Unity and Peace.</p>

            <p>HE that gave me notice of this Book which I anÅ¿wer, did withall Å¿end me a ManuÅ¿cript to be privately anÅ¿wered, containing the very Å¿ame things, but Å¿omewhat enlarged: His diÅ¿pleaÅ¿ure againÅ¿t my former mention of his private Writings to me, and the Contents, made me confident that he would not have any thing PubliÅ¿hed which I Å¿hould anÅ¿wer to his laÅ¿t: By which I found my Å¿elf in a notable Å¿trait: For if he at once privately Å¿ent me his reaÅ¿ons, and alÅ¿o in another Book Printed them, if I Å¿hould anÅ¿wer his private papers (which reaÅ¿on forbad me doing in my condition, for his uÅ¿e alone) I Å¿hould judg my Å¿elf foreÅ¿talled from anÅ¿wering the Printed Book, becauÅ¿e the matter being the very Å¿ame (and 'tis likely by the Å¿ame man) I Å¿hould be Å¿uppoÅ¿ed to have broken the Laws of Civility, to have anÅ¿wered his private papers. But (having no AmanuenÅ¿is, or Scribe to take any Copy of his papers, or my own) I thought it the beÅ¿t way to return his unanÅ¿wered (they being Written for my uÅ¿e, which Reading will as fully Å¿erve as anÅ¿wering them) but Å¿uppoÅ¿ing the Printed papers muÅ¿t be anÅ¿wer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I inÅ¿erted alÅ¿o an anÅ¿wer to the Å¿trength of all his additionals in the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cript.</p>
            <p>And at laÅ¿t he giveth me Å¿ome notice of his thoughts of publiÅ¿hing the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cript, or a vindication of it. Which falls well for the Readers uÅ¿e, that I have anÅ¿wered that ManuÅ¿cript before it is PubliÅ¿hed, without taking notice of it, and Å¿<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

You have the freedom of uÅ¿ing words at your pleaÅ¿ure, but not impoÅ¿ing them on mankind; when neceÅ¿Å¿ity hath taught the World to diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿h eÅ¿Å¿ential and integral parts, you have no authority to confound their Language, by the quibble of calling <hi>Integrals eÅ¿Å¿ential cauÅ¿es of the whole: A totum per aggregationem</hi>

And if you make contiguity an eÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ential cauÅ¿e, or how elÅ¿e you will, you have liberty of Å¿peech: But we will not be cheated by it to believe that it cauÅ¿eth any more than <hi>Totality</hi> or <hi>Integrality,</hi> and the abÅ¿ence of it is a privation of no more. And all mens Graces, Obedience, and WorÅ¿hip, are defective in point of Integrality and degree, and I hope you will not Å¿ay that they need no favour, or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, or amendment.</p>
            <p n="2">2. All human actions have their faults: muÅ¿t we therefore do nothing, or converÅ¿e with no men? <hi>England</hi> is one Kingdom; If there be one or many faults in its Laws or officers, may we therefore obey none that are faultleÅ¿s? The Laws are the Rule of National JuÅ¿tice; may a Judg, JuÅ¿tice, Officer or Å¿ubject uÅ¿e none of them, becauÅ¿e Å¿ome are faulty? Doth that make him guilty of all? <hi>Bonum eÅ¿t ex cauÅ¿is integris:</hi> The fault of a part may indeed denominate the whole faulty Å¿o far. But the whole Law or Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy may be called faulty for a part, and yet he that uÅ¿eth either, not be guilty of any of the bad part, for uÅ¿ing the good. The Law and Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy are one thing, and the uÅ¿e is another: Its faults are no further his, than he owneth them; your Bread or Meat may be called bad, if part only be bad, and yet if you eat none but the good part, it will not hurt you.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But if it muÅ¿t be otherwiÅ¿e, no man may hear you, or joyn with your Churches: And do you think (as aforeÅ¿aid) that Mr. <hi>Faldo,</hi> and all his Church at <hi>Barnet,</hi> lived not in a Å¿inful communion very many years, that omitted at leaÅ¿t an integral part of publick worÅ¿hip, the Å¿inging of Gods praiÅ¿e? ChriÅ¿t with his DiÅ¿ciples Å¿ung a Hymn after the Sacrament. The <hi>Jews</hi> Church made it the chief part of their WorÅ¿hip. <hi>James</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cribeth it us in all our Holy Mirth, Å¿uch as the Lords Day is appointed for, 1 Cor. 14.26. <hi>Every one had a PÅ¿alm,</hi> and with them <hi>no one had a PÅ¿alm,</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:63048:57"/>
tho his Judgment was for it; the queÅ¿tion was, Whether he Å¿hould forÅ¿ake them for refuÅ¿ing it: I thought not, becauÅ¿e it was better that they had Å¿omething that was good, than nothing. But your argument would not only unchurch them, but make all Å¿inners that communicated with them: for omiÅ¿Å¿ions of great duties are faults, and greater faults than tolerable failings in performance: He that prayeth not at all, doth worÅ¿e than he that prayeth by a Book; and he that preacheth or teacheth not at all, doth worÅ¿e than he that readeth a Sermon; Å¿o that their total Å¿tated omiÅ¿Å¿ion and oppoÅ¿ition to Å¿inging, by your falÅ¿e rule, denominated them <hi>no worÅ¿hippers of God,</hi> if the whole muÅ¿t be denominated from a part.</p>
            <p>How many private Meetings in <hi>London,</hi> never Å¿ing a PÅ¿alm for fear of being diÅ¿covered? Yea, how many Å¿eldom read a Chapter, but only preach and pray, and Å¿ometime adminiÅ¿ter the Sacrament? MuÅ¿t we needs Å¿ay therefore that they omit all WorÅ¿hip?</p>
            <p n="6">VI. On Å¿uch occaÅ¿ions I argued, That if we muÅ¿t not communicate with any PariÅ¿h Church becauÅ¿e of the faults of the Liturgy, it will follow, that we muÅ¿t not communicate with any Church on Earth that hath as great faults; and that by this we muÅ¿t renounce Communion with all ChriÅ¿ts Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy on Earth: All the <hi>Armenians, NeÅ¿torians, Eutychians, Copties, AbaÅ¿Å¿ines, Georgians, Greeks, RuÅ¿Å¿ians, PapiÅ¿ts,</hi> yea <hi>Lutherans,</hi> have a more faulty Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, or manner of worÅ¿hip, than the <hi>EngliÅ¿h.</hi> Yea the Churches called Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniÅ¿ts have their Liturgies and faults: And I inÅ¿tanced in <hi>Switzerland,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e as God hath of late moÅ¿t preÅ¿erved their peace, Å¿o they are taken to be the honeÅ¿teÅ¿t Å¿ort of ProteÅ¿tants, that in poverty Å¿erve God with Å¿oundeÅ¿t doctrine, and leaÅ¿t Å¿candal of Life, but yet have no proper diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline but the MagiÅ¿trates? Is it a Å¿in to have confederacy or Communion with their Churches?</p>
            <p>To this he plainly Å¿aith Page 11. It is: <hi>That is, all that confederate with them, as Churches, are guilty of their error, called EraÅ¿tian: For Å¿ubjection t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>

            <p n="2">2. For my part I have oft publiÅ¿hed, That it is not the leaÅ¿t part of my charge againÅ¿t Popery, that they unchurch almoÅ¿t all the ChriÅ¿tian World Å¿ave themÅ¿elves: But yet they are about a 4th or 3d part of profeÅ¿Å¿ed ChriÅ¿tians themÅ¿elves; and divers of them do not unchurch the <hi>Greeks</hi>;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:63048:58"/>
But to unchurch or forbid Communion with all that are as faulty, as the <hi>Helvetians</hi> and all other ProteÅ¿tant Churches that have Liturgies or partial faults, is that which I dare not be guilty of: I think that to Å¿ay, That a thouÅ¿and parts to one of ChriÅ¿ts Church, are none of his Churches, is next to depoÅ¿ing him from his Kingdom: Much like as it would be to Å¿ay, no part of <hi>London</hi> is the Kings but <hi>Amen Corner,</hi> nor any part of <hi>England</hi> but <hi>Barnet</hi> or <hi>Brentford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. And is it not one of our juÅ¿t accuÅ¿ations of the PapiÅ¿ts, That they Å¿ay all the ProteÅ¿tant Churches are no true Churches, and the MiniÅ¿ters no true PaÅ¿tors; and that Communion with them is unlawful? and Å¿hall we now juÅ¿tifie them and Å¿ay as they (tho not on the Å¿ame ReaÅ¿on, but for a far Å¿maller difference)? Is this our running from Popery?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Yea, is it not the great thing that we accuÅ¿e the Å¿uperconformiÅ¿ts for? That they make us to be no true MiniÅ¿ters or Churches? and are we indeed of the Å¿ame mind?

To call any practice, <hi>Equivocation,</hi> or by any ill name<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> is no proof that it is Å¿o; nor is here a word of true proof given us: I ask the ConÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate; Is it in the power of a Law-maker, to make all WorÅ¿hip and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to God unlawful by commanding to do it for an unlawful end, or upon falÅ¿e principles? What if a Law Å¿aid, All people Å¿hall worÅ¿hip God, not
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:63048:58"/>
becauÅ¿e the Scripture commandeth it, but becauÅ¿e the State com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands it? Would this make it unlawful to worÅ¿hip God? I would diÅ¿own the Principle, and go on.</p>
            <p>What if the Law Å¿hould Å¿ay, The PaÅ¿toral Office is not of Divine Right, but humane, muÅ¿t the office therefore be renounced? And why can Å¿uch a Law any more bind me to judg of Church-conÅ¿titu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by the Lawmakers words, rather than by Gods Word?</p>
            <p>SuppoÅ¿e that the <hi>AnabaptiÅ¿ts</hi> Å¿ay, That rebaptizing is the true way of Church-gathering: Is it a Å¿in to communicate with them, if they will receive me when I profeÅ¿s the contrary.</p>
            <p>I am againÅ¿t the Covenant which you defend, as making an <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent</hi> Church: Is it therefore a Å¿in to communicate with them, becauÅ¿e it is not as conÅ¿tituted by that Covenant?</p>
            <p>What do Parties more differ in of late, than Forms, Orders, Modes and CircumÅ¿tances of Church Government; and if they be of many contrary minds, were it twenty, there can be but one of them in the right: And is it unlawful to join with all the reÅ¿t?

            <p>AlmoÅ¿t all the Churches that I hear of in the world, have their agreed profeÅ¿Å¿ions publiÅ¿hed; the ProteÅ¿tants are gathered in the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus confeÅ¿Å¿ionum</hi>; the EngliÅ¿h Church Principles and Orders are expreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed in the Book of Canons, the Liturgy, Ordination, the 39 Articles, the Homilies, the Apology, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> MuÅ¿t every one Å¿tay from their Churches, till he hath read and underÅ¿tood all theÅ¿e Books, and be Å¿ure that there is no fault or error in them?

            <p>You will Å¿ay, That is their crime that make all theÅ¿e ConfeÅ¿Å¿ions and Books: They will anÅ¿wer, but that's none of our fault: We made them not, and yet muÅ¿t we not communicate with any Church that maketh Å¿uch? The old SeparatiÅ¿ts, called <hi>BrowniÅ¿ts,</hi> publiÅ¿hed their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿Å¿ion, and therein owned many PariÅ¿h Churches in <hi>England,</hi> and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with them: I recited their words in my ReaÅ¿ons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But you are gone beyond them: The <hi>New<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> England</hi> churches printed their confeÅ¿Å¿ion, and all there agreed not to it: The EngliÅ¿h <hi>Independents</hi> publiÅ¿hed their Principles and ConfeÅ¿Å¿ions: And the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and they agreed in the <hi>WeÅ¿tminÅ¿ter</hi> Synods confeÅ¿Å¿ion, catechiÅ¿m and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory: Is every poor Man and Woman bound to Å¿tay from all their

            <p>The <hi>AnabaptiÅ¿ts</hi> publiÅ¿hed their confeÅ¿Å¿ion: The <hi>Dutch</hi> have theirs: Many churches agreed with them in the Synod of <hi>Dort.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> have theirs; the <hi>Saxons,</hi> the <hi>Helvetians, Geneva,</hi> the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> the <hi>ProteÅ¿tants</hi> in general had the <hi>AuguÅ¿tane,</hi> and many more have theirs.

there were certain ceremonies called the <hi>cuÅ¿tomes of the UniverÅ¿al Church,</hi> which all the known Churches agreed in, (even thoÅ¿e that differ'd about <hi>EaÅ¿ter-day,</hi> and other Å¿uch) that is, 1.

            <p>Now I agree with this Author, that theÅ¿e things were indeed a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viation from the ApoÅ¿tles practice, and ought not to have been thus uÅ¿ed: But the queÅ¿tion is, whether every ChriÅ¿tian was guilty of the fault that had communion with any of theÅ¿e churches? and whether had he then lived, he Å¿hould have Å¿eparated from all the Churches on earth?</p>
            <p>By this you Å¿ee, that this opinion muÅ¿t needs make men Å¿eekers, who Å¿ay, that the church was in the wilderneÅ¿s, and loÅ¿t all true MiniÅ¿try, (and, Å¿ay they, particular churches, and Scripture) after the firÅ¿t (or at moÅ¿t the Å¿econd) century: and Å¿o that for fourteen hundred years ChriÅ¿t had no viÅ¿ible Kingdom on earth: And conÅ¿equently, that we have no wiÅ¿er anÅ¿wer to the PapiÅ¿t [<hi>where was your church before Luther</hi>] than to Å¿ay that it was <hi>InviÅ¿ible</hi>; that is, that we cannot prove that there was any Å¿uch thing on Earth; and conÅ¿equently, that we cannot prove that ChriÅ¿t had any Kingdom on earth, and was its King; that is, whether there was any ChriÅ¿t in actual church-adminiÅ¿tration? And doth Å¿epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating from the whole viÅ¿ible church-communion agree with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies and precepts of union? Was this church like a grain of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tard Å¿eed in its growth? Was all the wonderful works of redemption wrought for no viÅ¿ible Å¿ociety after one or two hundred years, in which a few perÅ¿ecuted ones were viÅ¿ible? Is not this the next Å¿tep (and a temptation) to utter infidelity? If ChriÅ¿t have now no viÅ¿ible church on earth, but the people called <hi>BrowniÅ¿ts</hi> or <hi>SeparatiÅ¿ts,</hi> doth it anÅ¿wer the Scripture deÅ¿cription of him and his church? And is it not expoÅ¿ing chriÅ¿tianity to the Å¿corn of infidels, Å¿o to Å¿ay ? Would not almoÅ¿t all rather turn PapiÅ¿ts, than believe this? And be rather of their church, than of none.</p>

            <p n="8">VIII. I argued alÅ¿o, from the common frailties of us all, that it will be unlawful to communicate with any Church on earth, even with thoÅ¿e of the objectors mind, if we are guilty of the Å¿ins in Doctrine, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hip and diÅ¿cipline, of all Churches that we communicate with. I will aggravate none, nor render that odious which God accepteth: My work is to confute thoÅ¿e that do Å¿o. But I Å¿ay, that 1. we have all many errors; And men uÅ¿e to put their errors into their prayers and preaching 2. Do not men uÅ¿e to deliberate more, and Å¿tudy what to write, than what to preach? And have men reaÅ¿on to be confident that our preaching will be more Å¿ounder than our writing? This Author exclaims againÅ¿t me, as PopiÅ¿h, Arminian, for JuÅ¿tification by works, for merit, &amp;c. May it not be expected that I preach as bad as I write? And is it not then a Å¿in to be my hearer? Can I think
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:63048:60"/>
that he will not preach as ill as he writeth in this book? And are all Å¿in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners therefore for hearing him? I promiÅ¿e him that if I know of any PariÅ¿h MiniÅ¿ter that will uÅ¿ually preach with as much error, reflexion and gall as he here writeth, I will be none of that mans hearers, or uÅ¿ual Communicants.</p>

This ReaÅ¿on croÅ¿Å¿eth the buÅ¿ineÅ¿s of the opponent; for whereas the greateÅ¿t reaÅ¿on againÅ¿t Communion with PariÅ¿h Churches is the badneÅ¿s of the Communicants, and MiniÅ¿ters lives; theÅ¿e are not the obeying of the Law or Canons, but diÅ¿obeying them: The Law, called the Rule, bids no man Å¿wear raÅ¿hly, lye, be drunk, unclean, Å¿lander, rail, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nay it commandeth the MiniÅ¿ter to deny the Sacrament to Å¿uch: Ignorance, unbelief, hypocriÅ¿ie, are not commanded, but forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by that Rule: MiniÅ¿ters break the rule, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="1">1. Gods Law is never a falÅ¿e rule, but an erring ExpoÅ¿itor may make the words the matter of a falÅ¿e rule by putting on them a falÅ¿e Å¿enÅ¿e.</p>

Indeed it is more fitly called the diÅ¿cerner of his rule and duty, as the eye is to the body: For it maketh not duty, but diÅ¿cerneth it made: But if any will call the <hi>UnderÅ¿tanding a Rule</hi> to the <hi>Will,</hi> inÅ¿tead of a <hi>Guide,</hi> we may bear with the impropriety. All this is clear truth.</p>
            <p>Now the queÅ¿tion is, how any of theÅ¿e Å¿ubordinate rules are <hi>juÅ¿t</hi> or <hi>falÅ¿e</hi>?</p>
            <p n="1">1. Two things God hath not only allowed, but commanded them all to do about Religion. 1. To command Å¿ubjects as Gods officers to obey Gods Laws, and in juÅ¿t caÅ¿es to puniÅ¿h the breakers of them, in matters within their juriÅ¿diction. And to do this by Laws, Mandates, Judgment and Execution. 2. To make Å¿ubordinate Mandates or Laws for determining Å¿uch CircumÅ¿tances as God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to determine, by the General Law of Governing or Ruling, and of doing all to unity concord, edification, peace, order, and decency.

            <p>And theÅ¿e rules may be called <hi>falÅ¿e</hi> or <hi>true,</hi> in Å¿everal degrees.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It's groÅ¿s falÅ¿ood and uÅ¿urpation, to Å¿et up an office forbidden of God, and falÅ¿e in its very nature.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It's next in degree falÅ¿e, for men of an office of Gods inÅ¿titution, to command things utterly out of their calling and juriÅ¿diction, in which they have no power from God mediately or immediately. ConÅ¿cience binds none to formal obedience (<hi>propter authoritatem imperan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis</hi>) to either of theÅ¿e; tho material obedience, and non-reÅ¿iÅ¿tance, may be duties.</p>
            <p>The lower degree, is when the office is of God, and the matter is in their power, and not only belonging <hi>ad alienum forum</hi>; But they <hi>miÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determine</hi> it in the manner, not uÅ¿urping anothers office, but doing their own amiÅ¿s: Tho herein conÅ¿cience is not bound to obedience; <hi>gratia materiae Å¿ub ratione indebiti modi</hi>; yet if the matter be not forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of God, obedience may be a duty herein, <hi>Å¿ub ratione medii,</hi> neceÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ary to Å¿everal ends; that is, <hi>to concord, to honour the governor, to avoid off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nce, and to avoid greater hurt to the Church, others, or our Å¿elves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if the thing commanded be forbidden of God, no man muÅ¿t do it. But divers things commanded unlawfully in the manner, may become duties by that command, becauÅ¿e they be made thereby need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful means of Unity, Peace, Honour to Rulers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as aforeÅ¿aid, which elÅ¿e would have been Å¿in (as to meet at an inconvenient time or place, to uÅ¿e a TranÅ¿lation, metre, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> leÅ¿s fit.)</p>
            <p>Now all theÅ¿e being Å¿ubordinate rules, they bind only Å¿ubordinately by virtue of Gods Å¿upreme rule, who made them rulers (and he is no ruler that can give no rule); even as corporation By Laws bind only by vertue of the Soveraigns higher Law.</p>
            <p>And tho this Author would be the Ruler of Language Å¿o far, as to Å¿ay that all <hi>Å¿inful WorÅ¿hip is not falÅ¿e WorÅ¿hip,</hi> they that uÅ¿e words, as greater MaÅ¿ters have long Å¿tated the Å¿ence, do know, that the falÅ¿eneÅ¿s is the diÅ¿conformity to Gods Å¿upream Rule, and that may be in all the degrees forementioned: And Rules or WorÅ¿hip are both falÅ¿e Å¿o far as they are diÅ¿conform to the Law of God.</p>
            <p>And now wherein is our Rule, falÅ¿e and theirs true? 1. We own no Rule of direct immediate obedience to God, nor of any univerÅ¿al or unchangeable duty to God, but what his Law (of Nature, or Å¿uper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural)
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:63048:62"/>
doth make us. We hold that no man hath power to alter Gods word, to command any thing againÅ¿t it, nor any thing which God hath appropriated to himÅ¿elf, as to make new conditions of Å¿al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, new Sacraments, new Laws, as Gods, or new duties for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves, neceÅ¿Å¿ary to Salvation; no, nor any thing but what Gods own General Law doth command or allow them to determine, being left by him undetermined, to their Power and Rule.</p>
            <p>We hold that if any Ruler go contrary to, and beyond thoÅ¿e Rules of God, it is their Å¿in, and not ours, and we openly diÅ¿own it: And Å¿o do our Rulers in general themÅ¿elves moÅ¿t expreÅ¿ly in the Books of Articles, Ordination, Homilies, Apology, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Binding all MiniÅ¿ters to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for the Rule of their Preaching and Living, only infallible, Å¿uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient in all things neceÅ¿Å¿ary to Salvation; and that if Councils, or any men err or diÅ¿agree with Scripture, they are not to be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>We openly renounce all falÅ¿e Rules, and Canons; but if for Å¿uch Å¿in againÅ¿t their own profeÅ¿Å¿ion of Scripture-Å¿ufficiency, we muÅ¿t re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce Communion with all that are guilty, we Å¿carce know the Church on Earth which we muÅ¿t not renounce. And the opponents in Particular.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For let us try now whether you have no Rule which you call <hi>FalÅ¿e,</hi> as well as falÅ¿e or Å¿inful practice. But I will firÅ¿t take in his ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler explication, left I miÅ¿take him.</p>

            <p>By all this, it is evident that Church Rulers there muÅ¿t be; and Å¿uch Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿ors of the ApoÅ¿tles in the ordinary parts of their office as ChriÅ¿t will be with to the end of the World, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.20. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿o in what their Rule conÅ¿iÅ¿teth.</p>

            <p>Time and Place belong to all natural actions: But the Time and Place Å¿eparated to Gods WorÅ¿hip is an accident only of that.</p>
            <p>It is not the natural Å¿pecification of an act or circumÅ¿tance, or the generical nature that we Å¿peak of; but the individual accident or cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumÅ¿tance as appropriate to a religious work.</p>
            <p>Is love to God no worÅ¿hip, becauÅ¿e love is a natural act? Is praying no act of Religion, becauÅ¿e we may pray to men? Is eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no part of the Sacrament, becauÅ¿e we uÅ¿e them as natural acts for our daily Å¿uÅ¿tenance?

            <p>It magnifieth theÅ¿e acts to be applied to worÅ¿hip, and it is a commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of WorÅ¿hip-Ordinances that they are Å¿uited to nature, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance and Å¿anctifie it.</p>
            <p>Now at laÅ¿t I come cloÅ¿er to my queÅ¿tion: Have you no Church Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers among you? No Elders that rule well?

            <p>Oh what is Man! What are the beÅ¿t of Men! What doth the Church and World Å¿uffer by them!

Much more muÅ¿t we watch againÅ¿t deÅ¿ires of revenge, or call for fire from Heaven, or imitate any that injure us, by requiring evil with evil, but Å¿ee that we forgive as we would be forgiven. If they be impenitent, and God forgive them not, their Å¿uffering will be heavy enough.</p>
            <p n="3">3.

            <p>I here adjoin it to my confeÅ¿Å¿ions: 1.

That the practice of them that prophaned the Lords day, and the malignity of their abettors, made me too much offended at the books that called the <hi>Lords day no Sabbath,</hi> and the <hi>MiniÅ¿ters, PrieÅ¿ts,</hi> and the <hi>Table, an Altar,</hi> and the <hi>Sacrament, a Sacrifice</hi>: For
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:63048:69"/>
I now know that theÅ¿e allegorical Names were uÅ¿ual with the beÅ¿t of the ancient Churches without contradiction: And that the <hi>Lords Day</hi> is indeed never called <hi>the Sabbath</hi> in the New TeÅ¿tament; and that the word <hi>Sabbath</hi> in the Bible Å¿ignifieth <hi>a day of ceremonial ReÅ¿t,</hi> which was a <hi>JewiÅ¿h Ceremony</hi>; and that all Å¿uch are by <hi>Paul</hi> Å¿aid to be put down, and that the <hi>Lords Day</hi> is a day of <hi>holy AÅ¿Å¿emblies</hi> and rejoicing in Å¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, Evangelical WorÅ¿hip.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>prejudice</hi> in theÅ¿e controverÅ¿ies prevailed, not from <hi>argument,</hi> but from the <hi>experience</hi> of the <hi>quality of</hi> too many that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿ed them: They thought it a moÅ¿t improbable thing, that God Å¿hould illuminate vicious, worldly haters of GodlineÅ¿s, and deÅ¿ert thoÅ¿e that moÅ¿t deÅ¿ired to pleaÅ¿e him.</p>
            <p>And of late times, what abundance have been driven from the publick Churches, by thoÅ¿e that rail at them when they come there, and would get the Birds into their Net by throwing Å¿tones and bawl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at them; and would get the fiÅ¿h to take the bait, by beating the Waters.</p>
            <p>The BiÅ¿hop of <hi>WorceÅ¿ters</hi> Å¿ilencing me, and preaching as he did, and the impriÅ¿onment of many of the people after, affected my old hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers with Å¿o much diÅ¿taÅ¿t of that Å¿ort of men, that all the Writings and perÅ¿waÅ¿ions I could uÅ¿e, would not reconcile them, nor Å¿carce keep them from falling out with me for my perÅ¿waÅ¿ions: And now they have a Worthy, Pious, preaching BiÅ¿hop, a Man of Love and Peace, and a good MiniÅ¿ter, they all crowd the Church, and are like to fall in love with Å¿uch BiÅ¿hops.</p>
            <p>And I muÅ¿t teÅ¿tifie, that with the generality of the Nonconforming Laity, I never found, but it was <hi>good preaching</hi> and <hi>good living</hi> that won their Love: And they will honour and follow Å¿uch men, whether Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hops, ConformiÅ¿ts, or NonconformiÅ¿ts.</p>
            <p n="15">XV. Since the writing of this, I underÅ¿tand that Å¿ome timerous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ons have been afraid to communicate in publick, or joyn with the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy, by hearing that Å¿ome that have done it, have been Å¿o troubled in ConÅ¿cience, that they have fallen into deÅ¿pair, and a doleful Å¿tate of trouble.</p>
            <p>To this I anÅ¿wer, 1. You Å¿hall never prove that I have perÅ¿waded any MiniÅ¿ter, to give ChriÅ¿ts body and blood as a Drench to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing, or to make the Sacrament of Love, the InÅ¿trument of Malice or Cruelty, or a Å¿nare to Å¿trangle Souls. It muÅ¿t be that Offence muÅ¿t come, but wo to them by whom it cometh. The old Church made men

beg for Church-Communion; if any withdraw from it, and excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate themÅ¿elves, they did not Å¿end them to Goal for their ConverÅ¿ion, to force them to Å¿ay, that they repent, and to force them to Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But I muÅ¿t Å¿ay, that theÅ¿e MiniÅ¿ters or people that have Å¿o ill taught theÅ¿e troubled Souls (by Doctrine or Example) as to tempt them to take their Duty (or a lawful thing) for Å¿o deadly a Å¿in, are far from being guiltleÅ¿s of their Trouble, DiÅ¿traction or DeÅ¿truction. If any Å¿hould make them believe that it were Å¿uch a dangerous thing to pray by a Book, to Å¿ing <hi>Davids</hi> PÅ¿alms, to Communicatie with Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians, not to be rebaptized, not to keep the <hi>Saturday</hi> Sabbath, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And then, when he hath affrighted one to make away himÅ¿elf in melancholy deÅ¿pair, Å¿hould uÅ¿e this inÅ¿tance as an argument to affright a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way others alÅ¿o from their duty; I Å¿hould think that he were too blame: This were not by <hi>good words and fair Å¿peeches,</hi> but by <hi>bad words and deeds,</hi> to deceive the hearts of the Å¿imple, in cauÅ¿ing diviÅ¿ions and offences.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I believe I have had with me in my time many Å¿cores that have had Å¿uch melancholly terrors, without any Å¿uch cauÅ¿e; and muÅ¿t the matter of their trouble therefore be proved faulty? I have known thoÅ¿e that for many years could have no peace of mind, while they continued Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox and Religious; and at laÅ¿t hearing Irreligious Sadduces, turned <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I will not write a Book to contend on the queÅ¿tion, Whether Mr. <hi>Faldo</hi> or I be the wiÅ¿er or better man: I am conÅ¿cious of Å¿o much ignorance and bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s, that if it may edifie the Reader, let him think of me as ill, as Mr. <hi>Faldo</hi> and all Å¿uch men would have him: If he have a good cauÅ¿e, I wiÅ¿h the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may be of his mind: If not, I find not my Å¿elf obliged to talk on againÅ¿t Å¿uch Writers any further, for his reÅ¿cue; nor do I think I can Å¿ay any thing herein, which at his rate Mr. <hi>Faldo</hi> cannot anÅ¿wer.</p>
            <p>I only Å¿ay, that he and Å¿uch other have Å¿atisfied me, That the Liturgy-VVorÅ¿hip in the common Lords Day office is comparatively purer than the VVorÅ¿hip of many is like to be, who oppoÅ¿e it.

And tho he Å¿eem diÅ¿pleaÅ¿ed for being called a conÅ¿enter to my catholick communion, either he conÅ¿ented that the <hi>PariÅ¿h-Church-WorÅ¿hip Å¿hould rather be uÅ¿ed than none,</hi> or elÅ¿e (which I Å¿uÅ¿pect<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>) when I have read his Book, I cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tand Å¿o much as what he is for or againÅ¿t; what he meaneth by a <hi>Meeting</hi> of <hi>four,</hi> whether he take it for a <hi>Church,</hi> I know not: I take it not for a Church, that hath no MiniÅ¿ter or Sacrament: And if he know of Å¿o many Å¿core, or hundred thouÅ¿and Nonconformable MiniÅ¿ters as may guide all the

My glaÅ¿s is almoÅ¿t run: If I be not more apprehenÅ¿ive of my Å¿peedy account, and it awe me not to own nothing but the truth, without dawbing with one extream or other, I am much to blame. And I have Å¿een Å¿ome more of the experience of both extremes (tho alas I Å¿aw too much before).</p>
            <p>And after all, comparing all together, I leave poÅ¿terity my thoughts.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> That I had rather the Church had a Liturgy (to make all foreknow what WorÅ¿hip they meet for) with free prayer alÅ¿o in its place, than to have either alone.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> If they muÅ¿t be Å¿eparated when the Minister is of tryed Å¿oundneÅ¿s and ability; I had rather have his free prayer alone. But for many others, I had rather have the Liturgy alone.</p>
            <p>And for inÅ¿tance, Mr. <hi>Faldo</hi> hath oft told me, that his Church at <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi> (as I twice Å¿aid before) not only omitted, but renounced or oppoÅ¿ed all Å¿inging of PÅ¿alms for many years; that many of them were of Å¿uch ill opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, that he was put to much work to Å¿ave them from being Quakers (and at what coÅ¿t they can now have Church-Meetings when he hath left them, I know not).</p>
            <p>For Mr. <hi>Faldo</hi> to hold up Å¿uch a Church even to Å¿uffering, and to write againÅ¿t Communion with the Liturgy, where there are able godly MiniÅ¿ters, is either erroneous partiality in him, or I am blind in my unwilling ignorance.</p>
            <p>To which I further add again, that I cannot expect that men Preach Å¿ounder Doctrine than they Å¿tudiouÅ¿ly Write; nor that they pray more Å¿oundly than they preach; and if Mr. <hi>Faldo,</hi> and all Å¿uch Writers, Å¿o pray, and Å¿o preach, and Å¿o live, (much more if alÅ¿o their Churches have Å¿uch Maimed WorÅ¿hip as aforeÅ¿aid, and Å¿ome of them unordained MiniÅ¿ters, and many Churches men of many contrary doctrines) I take the Common-prayer Book WorÅ¿hip and Communion, to be much purer than theirs. The Lord make our Å¿ucceÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ors wiÅ¿er, better, and more peaceable than we are.</p>
