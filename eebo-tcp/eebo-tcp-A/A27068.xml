            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="3">III. The ſame is true of the name [<hi>Paſtor.</hi>]</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Dioceſan Churches are of three ſorts. 1. Such as have at preſent but one fixed Aſſembly, but deſign to gather more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after: Such, Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> thought they were in Scripture times. 2. Such as have one Dioceſan Governour, or Superintendent over many inferior Churches, and their Paſtors. 3. Such as have one only Biſhop or Paſtor, having no other true Paſtor, Elder, Church-Ruler, or Presbyter of Chriſts Inſtitution under him; but Chappels which have no ſuch Ruler or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor.</p>
            <p n="5">V. The firſt ſort of Dioceſans we have now nothing to do with.</p>
            <p>The ſecond ſort is controverible, ſome holding it ſinful, ſome lawful, and ſome (and very many) to be of Divine Inſtitution, as Succeſſors of the Apoſtles, not in the extraordinaries, but in the ordinary parts of their Office: Chriſt having made an imparity (or a ſuperiority of ſome over o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) they think that to ſay without proof, that he changed that order in one Age, is 1. to charge him with mutability and levity. 2. And to dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh from his Law (which hath a Curſe.)</p>
            <p>The third ſort of Dioceſans, is either 1. of a Dioceſs (like a great Pariſh with Chappels) ſo ſmall that one Paſtor may poſſibly overſee it. (This is tollerable, when more cannot be had; and when they can, it hurts only <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>he well-being of the Church): Or 2. it is of a Dioceſs ſo great as that one man cannot do what is eſſential to a Paſtor, and ſo it is undone: This nullifieth that Species of Churches which is of Chriſts Inſtitution.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. A particular Church of Chriſts Inſtitution of the loweſt political order, is, [<hi>A competent number of Neighbour-Chriſtians, who by Chriſts ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, and their own expreſt conſent, are aſſociated with one or more Paſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p n="7">VII. The Paſtoral Office as over this firſt or loweſt Church, and as it is in unfixed Miniſters, related yet to no one Church more than another, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth but as the ſubject matter (or object) of their charge doth differ, and not in the fundamental Power or Order.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. This Paſtoral Office is eſſentially Miniſterial to Chriſt as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, Prieſt, and King of his Church. 1. A Power to Teach. 2. To Lead in Worſhip. 3. To Guide by the Keys of Reception, Admonition, Excluſion and Reſtoration.</p>
            <p n="9">IX.

Therefore every limitation, reſtraint, rebuke, or puniſhment, for Mal-adminiſtration, nullifieth not the Office, nor yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing an appeal to Superiors.</p>
            <p n="10">X. To hinder a <hi>Paſtor</hi> from <hi>forcible excluding</hi> men from Church or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and allow him only to do it by <hi>Application of Gods word,</hi> is agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his Office.</p>

It is <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Obligation to exerciſe,</hi> and not the preſent <hi>actual Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe,</hi> that is eſſential to the Office in the fundamental Relation: But ſhould the Non-exerciſe be total and ſtated, it would not make up a Church in act; No more than a mere Power to Teach, will make a School in act.</p>

It was the ſame to the Eccleſiaſtical Courts as now. If any pretend to ſuch ſingular skill in Law, as to ſay that there was no Law for the Book of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, which made the ordained to Covenant to obey their Ordinaries, nor any Law for the Canons, I hope he will have more reaſon than to lay the controverſie about Separation on his odd conceit, when all the People in <hi>England</hi> have in the days of the four laſt Soveraigns, been forced to ſubmit to theſe as Legal; and no ſuch pretender could at any time deliver them. Books have been written, and Pleas uſed againſt ſubmitting to the Courts that declared not that they held their Authority from the King; but the Judges ſtill over-ruled it againſt them And they that profeſt to hold it from the King, did many, if not moſt, mean but the Liberty of publick exerciſing it, as the Miniſtry is held under him, or the adjunct Cogent Power, or the <hi>Circa ſacra.</hi>

The Parliament and Convocations, and Biſhops and Clergy, all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that they have no power to overthrow the Church eſſentials or offices of Chriſts Inſtitution: They have not revoked the Church Writings in which all this is oft profeſſed: They confeſs that if their Laws miſtake and do contrary, they bind us not: They never openly profeſſed a war againſt God or Jeſus Chriſt: What if one Dr. <hi>S.

            <p>To ſay then, that to plead a <hi>Divine right</hi> for them, is <hi>new,</hi> is to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict large Hiſtorical Evidences.

            <p>But where and how hath the Law or Church altered the caſe ſince 1640. Theſe words were in the Book of Ordination before, and I know of none plainer that way ſince. Its <hi>deſtructive Dioceſan</hi> Government, which

renounceth the Government of any ſubject Churches, but of one only, and of any Paſtors that I argue againſt, and not <hi>Governours</hi> of ſuch Churches.</p>
            <p n="34">XXXIV. But it's objected, <hi>That they ſwear</hi> [<hi>not to endeavour any altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Church-Government; therefore they renounce the Paſtoral Office, becauſe the preſent Government excludeth it.</hi>

            <p>

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. It is not true (that ever I heard) that they <hi>ſwear</hi> what this Objection ſaith: The Miniſters do not <hi>ſwear,</hi> but <hi>ſubſcribe</hi> it, and <hi>ſwear Obedience</hi> in <hi>licitis &amp; honeſtis:</hi> (And I could never learn what Law commands that Oath).

            <p n="3">3. Their Subſcription <hi>never to endeavour alteration,</hi> engageth them never to endeavour to deſtroy the Pariſh Churches and Miniſtry, and ſo is <hi>for them</hi>: For that would be a great alteration indeed.</p>
            <p n="4">4.

true Paſtor among the Presbyterians, when the <hi>Claſſis</hi> exerciſeth the higheſt part of the Power; nor in <hi>Helvetia,</hi> where Diſcipline is unexerciſed; nor in <hi>England</hi> from the firſt Reformation: Were all the Conformiſts that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Dioceſans no Church-Paſtors? nor no Independents, whoſe Churches having many Paſtors and Elders, no one exerciſeth (no nor hath) more than part of the power? <hi>Integrity</hi> and <hi>eſſentiality, office</hi> and exerciſe, are not all one.</p>
            <p n="2">2. All good Miniſters that I know in the Pariſh Aſſemblies, do conſent to the Paſtoral Office, and the people love them, and ſhew their conſent by ordinary Communion; and they exerciſe all eſſential to the office, tho under the <hi>reſtraints</hi> of Government, not owning (in conſent) <hi>deſtructive,</hi> but <hi>governing</hi> Dioceſans, ſome as <hi>de jure divino, lawful</hi>; ſome as beſt, ſome as neceſſary, many as merely impowered to a cogent Government by the King; and doth not your conceſſion imply, that theſe are true Churches? of intolerable men I ſpeak not.</p>
            <p n="3">3. What you confidently deny, is certainly true: There may be <hi>two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional churches</hi> in one nation, if not three; that is, the word is equivocal, and hath divers ſences; and it is not called <hi>national, becauſe</hi> all perſons in the nation are of it, but becauſe that the diffuſed parts of the Nation own it formally in a publick national relation.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A <hi>Chriſtian Kingdom</hi> as ſuch, is by many called a <hi>national Church</hi>; thus <hi>England</hi> is ſuch.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A coalition of the moſt, or all the publick Miniſters in a Nation in Synodical Agreements for Communion as ſuch, is called a <hi>National Church</hi>; ſuch alſo is <hi>England.</hi>

            <p n="3">3. The ſubjection of the moſt of the Clergy in a nation by conſent to ſome Eccleſiaſtical Primate, Patriarch, or other conſtitutive, governing Head (as a Biſhop is in his Dioceſs) may make a national Church in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſence.</p>
            <p>The ſame men may be of divers of theſe equivocal Churches; or if part be for one form, and part for another, yet agreeing in the ſame ordinary, external Communion; one part may be called national as well as the other.

               <hi>XLIX.</hi> What he ſaith about <hi>unlawful terms of Communion,</hi> p 21. &amp;c. in the inſtances of <hi>kneeling, putting off the hat, ſtanding up,</hi> &amp;c. I anſwer, 1. The Author all along ſeemeth to forget, that I am not <hi>accuſing him,</hi> not telling every man his duty, but only giving the Reaſons of my own and ſuch others practice: ſo they make a long ado, to vindicate him whoſe Manuſcript I anſwered, and ſay, <hi>His queſtion was only, whether it be lawful to communicate with the churches as ſetled by Law,</hi> and <hi>not in other reſpects</hi>? When I ever told them, I meddle with none of their Queſtions, but my own, viz, 1. <hi>Whether I and ſuch other do well or ill in that communion we hold with the Pariſh Churches</hi>? 2. <hi>Whether all Proteſtants in England are bound in conſcience to renounce and avoid Communion in the Liturgy with all Pariſh Churches and Chappels, and rather to give over all church worſhip</hi>?</p>
            <p>I only gave my Reaſons, why that Manuſcript (divulged and boaſted of as unanſwerable) changed not my Judgment; and I anſwered that in his Arguments, which went further than the queſtion put by them, and aſſault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my own aſſertions; having before in my <hi>Chriſtian Directory,</hi> and <hi>cure of Church diviſions</hi> (without naming him) fully anſwered his printed Reaſons, to prove it unlawful to uſe an impoſed form or Liturgy, <hi>eſpecially becauſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters muſt uſe their own gifts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if any man believe that it is a ſin to <hi>communicate kneeling, or ſtanding,</hi> or <hi>ſitting, unleſs he lye down as Chriſt did</hi>; or at any time, ſave at a feaſt or ſupper; or any where <hi>ſave in an Inn</hi> or an <hi>upper room,</hi> or with any <hi>women,</hi> or more <hi>than twelve,</hi> or if they think it ſin to <hi>kneel at prayer,</hi> or be <hi>uncove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,</hi> or to <hi>ſing Pſalms</hi> in our <hi>Metre and Tunes,</hi> whether theſe men ſhould ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from all the Churches that will not receive them in their own way, or how far they do well or ill that will not let every man do what he will, is none of the caſe that I have before me: It will not follow, that I muſt ſeparate from a Church that bids me kneel, and be uncovered, &amp;c. becauſe you take it to be ſin: put not your meaſures on all others.</p>
            <p>And here becauſe ſame maketh Mr. <hi>Faldo</hi> the Author of the Vindicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which I anſwered, that I may ſo far vindicate him, as to ſhew, that it's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

than in an abſent Biſhop? what greater omiſſion or defect is there in many Pariſh-Churches?</p>
            <p>I again ſay, that I am ſo far of the Judgment of <hi>Hilderſham, John Ball,</hi> &amp;c. that I had rather joyn (<hi>caeteris paribus</hi>) in a Church that uſeth the Pſalms, Chapters, and all the Lords-day Prayers in the Liturgy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Sermon, than one that only giveth us one Pſalm (or none) and a Pulpit-prayer and a Sermon without all the reſt of Church Worſhip.</p>
            <p n="50">L. I will conclude all with repeating a little of the Explication of my miſuſed writings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. The paſtoral <hi>Overſight</hi> of the <hi>Laity</hi> by the Elders, or Biſhops of the ſeveral Flocks, is of Chriſts Inſtitution, and belongs to all true Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: And tho in neceſſity it may be done by divers tranſient Miniſters, <hi>pro tempore,</hi> moſt regularly, every Church ſhould have its ſtated Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Where ſuch Churches are large, the work requireth many Miniſters, where each one hath but part of the <hi>Charge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. Reaſon and Church-conſent among theſe, made one a Preſident over the reſt, and called him the Biſhop pecularly, (if it were in <hi>Marks</hi> days, as <hi>Hierom</hi> ſaith, it was in <hi>John</hi>'s). And tho this be not eſſential to a Church, it is lawful, and fit; and at laſt it grew to ſo great a Reputation and Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of neceſſity, that all Churches had ſuch Biſhops, and gave them a Negative voice, and ordained not without them, and defined Churches as eſſentiated by Relation to them, <hi>Eccleſia eſt plebs Epiſcopo adunata.</hi> If now ſuch men as <hi>J.O.</hi> Mr. <hi>Nye,</hi> Dr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> &amp;c. ſhould have in one Church ſix or ſeven young men of their own training up to be their Aſſiſtant-pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, I do not think an Independent Church would take it for any crime that he ſhould have a Negative voice in acts of Order and Diſcipline, or that they ſhould ordain Miniſters therein without his Conſent.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. By degrees ſingle Congregations increaſed to as many as our great Pariſhes that have Chappels, and tho ſtill they communicated in the chief Church at ſome ſpecial times of the year; they ordinarily met in divers places, and the Presbyters officiated ſome in one meeting, and ſome in another; at firſt, whoſoever the Biſhop daily ſent; but after their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Tyths or Chappels were aſſigned to each; yet all together were eſteemed but one Church, governed by one Biſhop, and his Colledg of Presbyters.</p>
            <p n="5">V. When they increaſed yet more and more, fixed Chappels were aſſigned to fixed Presbyters; but not as diſtinct Churches, but parts of the Dioceſan Church, tho at laſt they were larger than one Biſhop and Colledg could guide, according to the firſt Inſtitution.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. Yet long every Chriſtian City had a Biſhop and Church, and every incorporate big Town, like our Corporations or Market-Towns, was called a City (not becauſe it had a Market, as a reverend Slanderer ſeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

            <p n="7">VII. Yet the People and Biſhops being ſenſible that there was more work For a Biſhop in a City-Dioceſs, than one could do; in many Countries they had Rural Biſhops ſet over <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Heathen Country might be his Dioceſs, but not his Church. The converted Chriſtians got into ſeveral Monaſteries, and not into Pariſh-Churches. Theſe Monaſteries were partly for Society in Religious Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, and partly for Studies, like Schools to Educate Youth for the Miniſtry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So that long a Dioceſs was only the Biſhops Church with divers Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. At laſt, Gentlemen for their convenience built and endowed Pariſh-Churches; the Biſhops old ſingle Churches being called the Cathedrals: And finally, by the help of Princes, all the Land was divided into Pariſhes, ſubject to the Cathedral-Biſhops, to whom Deans and Chapters were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in imitation of the old Biſhops Colledg of Presbyters in every ſingle Church.</p>

            <p>But I know how they govern, by what Canons, and by what Courts; and as all their Cogent power is from the King, it is no wonder if they be choſen by him: But the old ſort of Biſhops that had no forcing power, was ſo conſtantly otherwiſe choſen, that their Canons nulled the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates choice.

Dr <hi>Hammond,</hi> (and many old Canons before him) tells us, that the Bp. was out of the Church flock, to <hi>take care of all the poor, orphans, widows, ſtrangers</hi>; Deacons were herein but ſervants under them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> on 1 Cor 12.28. <hi>The ſupreme truſt</hi> and <hi>charge was reſerved to the Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Bps. of the Church.</hi> But the poor will ſtarve if the Incumbent with his aſſiſtance do not more in this than the Dioceſan.</p>

anciently mentioned as one branch of the office of Bps. therefore it may very reaſonably be reſolved that the Bps. of the Church, one in each particular Church, are here meant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> Is it the Dioceſan (perhaps 50 Miles off) that the ſick muſt ſend for, or that the Law and Church impoſe this on, (to viſit the ſick, and pray over them, &amp;c.)? or is it the Incumbents?</p>
            <p n="3">III. But the great doubt is, who hath the <hi>Power of Government,</hi> and who <hi>actually governs,</hi> (not by the ſword) but with the <hi>Miniſterial Paſtoral Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here it muſt ſtill be remembred. 1. That this particular power of the Keys or Government, is only by the word of God opened and appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; as Bp. <hi>Bilſon</hi> hath proved, and is commonly confeſſed; ſome call it <hi>Perſwaſive,</hi> ſome <hi>Directive,</hi> ſome <hi>Doctrinial</hi>; But it is not ſuch meer <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection or perſwaſion</hi> as any man may uſe to another; but ſuch as is the part of one commiſſioned to it as his office; An <hi>Authoritative perſwaſion,</hi> and a <hi>Judicial deciſion,</hi> as by an <hi>intruſted ſteward</hi> of Chriſt: but only <hi>on Conſcience,</hi> and <hi>on Voluntiers,</hi> and not by any power to exerciſe force on body or purſe. 2. That <hi>Governing,</hi> and <hi>unjuſt reſtraining this power,</hi> is not <hi>taking it away</hi> from the Paſtor; and laying <hi>penalties</hi> on men for <hi>exerciſing</hi> ſome part of that which Chriſt hath given, doth but bind men to bear that penalty when the exerciſe is neceſſary. Now let us conſider <hi>wherein</hi> the Governing Power doth conſiſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It primarily conſiſteth in judging who is capable of <hi>Baptiſme</hi> and ſo Baptizing them. This is the firſt and great exerciſe of the Keys, and that <hi>

            <p n="2">2. A ſecond great exerciſe of the Church Keys, is <hi>Miniſterially as from Chriſt to declare his Laws<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

methinks the Dioceſan here uſeth leſs of the <hi>judicial power</hi> than the Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent, for he doth but <hi>lay his hands</hi> on them and ſay a prayer over ſuch as come to him; for no man can dream that he can examine all the people in his Dioceſs ſo far as to judg whether they are fit for Communion: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is ſuppoſed but to <hi>execute</hi> the <hi>judgment</hi> of the <hi>certifying Incumbent</hi> (If he take all at a venture, without a certificate, or knowledg, or if the Incumbent be unfaithful, I cannot help or excuſe that). 3.

They may admoniſh him, (if he will ſpeak with them). 6. They may refuſe him if obſtinate and impenitent. 7. They may declare the reaſon why they do ſo, as Chriſts Miniſters by his Authority, and tell the Church their duty to avoid the Communion of ſuch. 8. They may bind him over to anſwer his contumacy at the Bar of God; and what of this is denied by the Church, to belong to the Incumbents Office? and who elſe is capable of doing this in Pariſhes that have multitudes of ungodly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons?</p>
            <p>If all this ſhould be made ſo <hi>difficult</hi> by the <hi>multitude</hi> and <hi>badneſs of delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents,</hi> or by <hi>bad Canons,</hi> or <hi>bad Government</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> by <hi>Dioceſans, Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficials,</hi> &amp;c. and thereby be almoſt all <hi>left undone,</hi> I cannot help that, nor excuſe it; but what I have ſaid againſt <hi>ſuch doing</hi> is too little: And if <hi>Prieſts</hi> be ſo <hi>bad,</hi> that they will (any where) ſooner ſcorn it than practice it, at the rate that it muſt coſt them, I am as much againſt ſuch Prieſts as others are: But I will not therefore make the <hi>Office of Christ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The ſum again is, 1.

            <p n="2">II. The ſaid office in <hi>mutable accidents</hi> or <hi>circumſtances</hi> may be altered by <hi>Princes Laws,</hi> or the ſeveral <hi>Churches Agreements,</hi> and thus far it is hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane.</p>

            <p>HE that gave me notice of this Book which I anſwer, did withall ſend me a Manuſcript to be privately anſwered, containing the very ſame things, but ſomewhat enlarged: His diſpleaſure againſt my former mention of his private Writings to me, and the Contents, made me confident that he would not have any thing Publiſhed which I ſhould anſwer to his laſt: By which I found my ſelf in a notable ſtrait: For if he at once privately ſent me his reaſons, and alſo in another Book Printed them, if I ſhould anſwer his private papers (which reaſon forbad me doing in my condition, for his uſe alone) I ſhould judg my ſelf foreſtalled from anſwering the Printed Book, becauſe the matter being the very ſame (and 'tis likely by the ſame man) I ſhould be ſuppoſed to have broken the Laws of Civility, to have anſwered his private papers. But (having no Amanuenſis, or Scribe to take any Copy of his papers, or my own) I thought it the beſt way to return his unanſwered (they being Written for my uſe, which Reading will as fully ſerve as anſwering them) but ſuppoſing the Printed papers muſt be anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I inſerted alſo an anſwer to the ſtrength of all his additionals in the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript.</p>
            <p>And at laſt he giveth me ſome notice of his thoughts of publiſhing the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript, or a vindication of it. Which falls well for the Readers uſe, that I have anſwered that Manuſcript before it is Publiſhed, without taking notice of it, and ſ<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Author profeſſeth himſelf my great acquaintance. Who he is, I know not; but he ſeemeth to be a very rational ſober man. God forbid that I ſhould ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute (unleſs duty do it accidentally) to the grievance of ſuch men. I doubt not but he ſpeaketh as he thinketh. And I doubt I have given him occaſions by ſome uncautelous words in my writings. I truly thank God and him, that I am called to review them, and to clear my ſence before I die. And I adjure the tearing perſecuting ſect, to think no more strangely and odiouſly of our differences in this caſe, than of the ſharp contention of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi>; or that men ſhould ſcramble if Gold and Pearls were ſcattered in the ſtreets, where dogs and ſwine would never ſtrive about them.

               <note rend="inter">§ 1.</note>THE chief matter of this Book is already anſwered by the Holy Ghoſt, 1 Cor. 1.10. 1 Cor. 3. Rom. 16.16, 17. Eph. 4.4. to the 17. Phil. 2.1, 2, 3. 1 Theſ. 5.12, 13. John 17.22, 23, 24. And 1 Cor. 12. And Acts 20.30.</p>
            <p>The Spirit and Stile of it is anſwered in the third Chapter of <hi>James</hi> throughout.</p>
            <p>I have nothing then to do but to anſwer the pretended argumentation of it: For the Author ſhall not draw me from my Defenſive part, to play the part of a plaintif againſt others, or to waſt my time in altercations, and ſpend many ſheets to tell the world that another man hath not skill to ſpeak ſence, and that he ſeduceth others by ambiguous words, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions.</p>

            <p n="3">3. This objection would inſinuate that all that are Baptized in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick manner in <hi>England,</hi> were thereby incorporated into an unlawful Church, which they muſt by being rebaptized, or by open renunciation diſclaim, And ſo that it is not Lawful to Communicate with any that were Baptized in the Pariſh Church, till they have repented it, or are

            <p n="4">4.

            <p>Obj. II. <hi>All that are liable to a Church Excommunication when they have offended, are declared Members of the Church. But all Communicants and Native Inhabitants are ſo. Therefore the Law hath excepted none. — How comes it to paſs, that the Church hath power of excommunicating any Perſon, but by vertue of Incorporation, which ſhe hath by the ſame Law? He that is not in the Church, how comes he to be caſt out? — Is he not by Communion in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of baptiſm made a Member?</hi>

            <p n="2">2. You know that they excommunicate Papiſts, and Atheiſts, who deride them for it and ſay, It's a ſtrange Church that will caſt us out, becauſe they cannot compel us to come in.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If this be a good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>argument, that all are of their Church that are excommunicate, then you are either ſafe from Excommunication; or of their Church, whether you will or not: If to make good your argument, you will aver that no Separatiſt, Independent, Presbyterian, Anabaptiſt, or Quaker, was ever<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>excommunicate, or impriſoned as ſuch, you will change the Current of Intelligence, and comfort many that can believe you, and teach them how to eſcape a Priſon for the time to come. But if not, you make your ſelf and all theſe parties, incorporate Members of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as well as me.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Do you think a Lay Civilian by Excommunicating, can prove or make a man a member of any Church againſt his will? Then mens Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt Pariſh Churches, for want of conſent, is void. They may be made ſuch againſt their wills.</p>

were never in it) but out of the Univerſal Church: If this be not their ſenſe, let them give it you themſelves, for I am not bound to be their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter.</p>
            <p>And yet to moderate our Cenſures of them, I'le tell you a wonder: Within this hour I received a Letter of credible Intelligence, of a Chancellor who hearing of a Conventicle not preſented by the Church-Wardens, and being told that they met to repeat the publick Sermon, ſaid, God forbid that they ſhould be hindered.</p>

And Chriſts Commiſſion to his Apoſtles was, <hi>To go and Diſciple all Nations</hi> (as much as in them lay) <hi>baptizing them.</hi> Nations as ſuch, were, firſt to be <hi>diſcipled,</hi> and <hi>then baptized,</hi> (Infants are part of Nations). And <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. Chriſt would have gathered <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> Children (all the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation) into his Church, as a Hen gathereth her Chickens under her Wings. And <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. Only their own unbelief broke them off from being a National Church, (including Infants). And it is part of the Saints triumph, that <hi>the Kingdoms of the World are become the Kingdoms of the Lord, and of his Chriſt.</hi> If you will read Mr. <hi>Beverlys</hi> Book, called <hi>The whole duty of Nations,</hi> it will give you full proof of this.</p>
            <p>Where hath the Goſpel <hi>extenſively</hi> much proſpered where Princes and Rulers were not Chriſtians? The <hi>Turks</hi> give liberty of Religion.

            <p>Obj. IV. 8. <hi>If ſuch a confederation in lawful Circumſtantials, as well as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrals, will make a Church, I know not why we may not have a Catholick Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church organized, if this be a due acception of a Church.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. You have the freedom of uſing words at your pleaſure, but not impoſing them on mankind; when neceſſity hath taught the World to diſtinguiſh eſſential and integral parts, you have no authority to confound their Language, by the quibble of calling <hi>Integrals eſſential cauſes of the whole: A totum per aggregationem</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as a heap of Sand, or a field of Graſs, is not conſtituted of a proper eſſentiating form, and ſo homogeneous mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter aggregate is all the being it hath. And if you make contiguity an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential cauſe, or how elſe you will, you have liberty of ſpeech: But we will not be cheated by it to believe that it cauſeth any more than <hi>Totality</hi> or <hi>Integrality,</hi> and the abſence of it is a privation of no more. And all mens Graces, Obedience, and Worſhip, are defective in point of Integrality and degree, and I hope you will not ſay that they need no favour, or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, or amendment.</p>
            <p n="2">2. All human actions have their faults: muſt we therefore do nothing, or converſe with no men? <hi>England</hi> is one Kingdom; If there be one or many faults in its Laws or officers, may we therefore obey none that are faultleſs? The Laws are the Rule of National Juſtice; may a Judg, Juſtice, Officer or ſubject uſe none of them, becauſe ſome are faulty? Doth that make him guilty of all? <hi>Bonum eſt ex cauſis integris:</hi> The fault of a part may indeed denominate the whole faulty ſo far. But the whole Law or Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy may be called faulty for a part, and yet he that uſeth either, not be guilty of any of the bad part, for uſing the good. The Law and Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy are one thing, and the uſe is another: Its faults are no further his, than he owneth them; your Bread or Meat may be called bad, if part only be bad, and yet if you eat none but the good part, it will not hurt you.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But if it muſt be otherwiſe, no man may hear you, or joyn with your Churches: And do you think (as aforeſaid) that Mr. <hi>Faldo,</hi> and all his Church at <hi>Barnet,</hi> lived not in a ſinful communion very many years, that omitted at leaſt an integral part of publick worſhip, the ſinging of Gods praiſe? Chriſt with his Diſciples ſung a Hymn after the Sacrament. The <hi>Jews</hi> Church made it the chief part of their Worſhip. <hi>James</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth it us in all our Holy Mirth, ſuch as the Lords Day is appointed for, 1 Cor. 14.26. <hi>Every one had a Pſalm,</hi> and with them <hi>no one had a Pſalm,</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:63048:57"/>
tho his Judgment was for it; the queſtion was, Whether he ſhould forſake them for refuſing it: I thought not, becauſe it was better that they had ſomething that was good, than nothing. But your argument would not only unchurch them, but make all ſinners that communicated with them: for omiſſions of great duties are faults, and greater faults than tolerable failings in performance: He that prayeth not at all, doth worſe than he that prayeth by a Book; and he that preacheth or teacheth not at all, doth worſe than he that readeth a Sermon; ſo that their total ſtated omiſſion and oppoſition to ſinging, by your falſe rule, denominated them <hi>no worſhippers of God,</hi> if the whole muſt be denominated from a part.</p>
            <p>How many private Meetings in <hi>London,</hi> never ſing a Pſalm for fear of being diſcovered? Yea, how many ſeldom read a Chapter, but only preach and pray, and ſometime adminiſter the Sacrament? Muſt we needs ſay therefore that they omit all Worſhip?</p>
            <p n="6">VI. On ſuch occaſions I argued, That if we muſt not communicate with any Pariſh Church becauſe of the faults of the Liturgy, it will follow, that we muſt not communicate with any Church on Earth that hath as great faults; and that by this we muſt renounce Communion with all Chriſts Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy on Earth: All the <hi>Armenians, Neſtorians, Eutychians, Copties, Abaſſines, Georgians, Greeks, Ruſſians, Papiſts,</hi> yea <hi>Lutherans,</hi> have a more faulty Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, or manner of worſhip, than the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> Yea the Churches called Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſts have their Liturgies and faults: And I inſtanced in <hi>Switzerland,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as God hath of late moſt preſerved their peace, ſo they are taken to be the honeſteſt ſort of Proteſtants, that in poverty ſerve God with ſoundeſt doctrine, and leaſt ſcandal of Life, but yet have no proper diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline but the Magiſtrates? Is it a ſin to have confederacy or Communion with their Churches?</p>
            <p>To this he plainly ſaith Page 11. It is: <hi>That is, all that confederate with them, as Churches, are guilty of their error, called Eraſtian: For ſubjection t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſuch diſcipline is the condition of their Communion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ. Subjection</hi> is an equivocal word: If it were by profeſſion or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of conſent it were indeed to be guilty of that error (tho not by a fau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t of the Part denominating the whole, to make their worſhip unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, or their Churches none) but if by ſubjection you mean but joyning in their Churches as Chriſtian and Proteſtant for doctrine and worſhip, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the defect which they cannot help, yea which they diſclaim, bare accuſation will not prove this a ſin; but by this we ſee how much of Chriſts Church you are for ſeparating from.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For my part I have oft publiſhed, That it is not the leaſt part of my charge againſt Popery, that they unchurch almoſt all the Chriſtian World ſave themſelves: But yet they are about a 4th or 3d part of profeſſed Chriſtians themſelves; and divers of them do not unchurch the <hi>Greeks</hi>;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:63048:58"/>
But to unchurch or forbid Communion with all that are as faulty, as the <hi>Helvetians</hi> and all other Proteſtant Churches that have Liturgies or partial faults, is that which I dare not be guilty of: I think that to ſay, That a thouſand parts to one of Chriſts Church, are none of his Churches, is next to depoſing him from his Kingdom: Much like as it would be to ſay, no part of <hi>London</hi> is the Kings but <hi>Amen Corner,</hi> nor any part of <hi>England</hi> but <hi>Barnet</hi> or <hi>Brentford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. And is it not one of our juſt accuſations of the Papiſts, That they ſay all the Proteſtant Churches are no true Churches, and the Miniſters no true Paſtors; and that Communion with them is unlawful? and ſhall we now juſtifie them and ſay as they (tho not on the ſame Reaſon, but for a far ſmaller difference)? Is this our running from Popery?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Yea, is it not the great thing that we accuſe the ſuperconformiſts for? That they make us to be no true Miniſters or Churches? and are we indeed of the ſame mind? One ſide ſaith, We are no true Miniſters for want of Bps. Ordination, &amp;c. Another ſide ſaith, You are no true Miniſters for having Communion with the Biſhops and Churches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

To call any practice, <hi>Equivocation,</hi> or by any ill name<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is no proof that it is ſo; nor is here a word of true proof given us: I ask the Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate; Is it in the power of a Law-maker, to make all Worſhip and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to God unlawful by commanding to do it for an unlawful end, or upon falſe principles? What if a Law ſaid, All people ſhall worſhip God, not

becauſe the Scripture commandeth it, but becauſe the State com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands it? Would this make it unlawful to worſhip God? I would diſown the Principle, and go on.</p>
            <p>What if the Law ſhould ſay, The Paſtoral Office is not of Divine Right, but humane, muſt the office therefore be renounced? And why can ſuch a Law any more bind me to judg of Church-conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by the Lawmakers words, rather than by Gods Word?</p>
            <p>Suppoſe that the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> ſay, That rebaptizing is the true way of Church-gathering: Is it a ſin to communicate with them, if they will receive me when I profeſs the contrary.</p>
            <p>I am againſt the Covenant which you defend, as making an <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent</hi> Church: Is it therefore a ſin to communicate with them, becauſe it is not as conſtituted by that Covenant?</p>
            <p>What do Parties more differ in of late, than Forms, Orders, Modes and Circumſtances of Church Government; and if they be of many contrary minds, were it twenty, there can be but one of them in the right: And is it unlawful to join with all the reſt? Muſt we needs be ſure which of theſe is in the right?</p>
            <p>Almoſt all the Churches that I hear of in the world, have their agreed profeſſions publiſhed; the Proteſtants are gathered in the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus confeſſionum</hi>; the Engliſh Church Principles and Orders are expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Book of Canons, the Liturgy, Ordination, the 39 Articles, the Homilies, the Apology, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Muſt every one ſtay from their Churches, till he hath read and underſtood all theſe Books, and be ſure that there is no fault or error in them?

            <p>You will ſay, That is their crime that make all theſe Confeſſions and Books: They will anſwer, but that's none of our fault: We made them not, and yet muſt we not communicate with any Church that maketh ſuch? The old Separatiſts, called <hi>Browniſts,</hi> publiſhed their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and therein owned many Pariſh Churches in <hi>England,</hi> and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with them: I recited their words in my Reaſons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But you are gone beyond them: The <hi>New<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> England</hi> churches printed their confeſſion, and all there agreed not to it: The Engliſh <hi>Independents</hi> publiſhed their Principles and Confeſſions: And the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and they agreed in the <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Synods confeſſion, catechiſm and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory: Is every poor Man and Woman bound to ſtay from all their

            <p>The <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> publiſhed their confeſſion: The <hi>Dutch</hi> have theirs: Many churches agreed with them in the Synod of <hi>Dort.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> have theirs; the <hi>Saxons,</hi> the <hi>Helvetians, Geneva,</hi> the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in general had the <hi>Auguſtane,</hi> and many more have theirs.

            <p>Let us riſe upward, till we come to the Apoſtles days: None of all theſe churches named, dare profeſs all their agreements and confeſſion to be without fault, that ever I heard of, except the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who bind Miniſters to aſſent and conſent to all things commanded and preſcribed in three Books and excommunicate thoſe that ſay their Books or Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and Government hath any thing contrary to the Word of God; but no Lay-man is bound to believe them; <hi>Wickliffe,</hi> and <hi>John H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:63048:59"/>
there were certain ceremonies called the <hi>cuſtomes of the Univerſal Church,</hi> which all the known Churches agreed in, (even thoſe that differ'd about <hi>Eaſter-day,</hi> and other ſuch) that is, 1. Cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Baptized in white Garments. 2. Giving them milk and hony to taſt. 3. Anointing them with Oyl. 4. Not kneeling in adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on any Lords day, or any other day between <hi>Eaſter</hi> and <hi>Whitſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.</hi> There is no notice when theſe began, ſo ancient were they, nor of any one Church or Chriſtian that refuſed them; but they were commonly called the Traditions Apoſtolical, or cuſtomes of the Univerſal Church.</p>
            <p>Now I agree with this Author, that theſe things were indeed a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viation from the Apoſtles practice, and ought not to have been thus uſed: But the queſtion is, whether every Chriſtian was guilty of the fault that had communion with any of theſe churches? and whether had he then lived, he ſhould have ſeparated from all the Churches on earth?</p>
            <p>By this you ſee, that this opinion muſt needs make men ſeekers, who ſay, that the church was in the wilderneſs, and loſt all true Miniſtry, (and, ſay they, particular churches, and Scripture) after the firſt (or at moſt the ſecond) century: and ſo that for fourteen hundred years Chriſt had no viſible Kingdom on earth: And conſequently, that we have no wiſer anſwer to the Papiſt [<hi>where was your church before Luther</hi>] than to ſay that it was <hi>Inviſible</hi>; that is, that we cannot prove that there was any ſuch thing on Earth; and conſequently, that we cannot prove that Chriſt had any Kingdom on earth, and was its King; that is, whether there was any Chriſt in actual church-adminiſtration? And doth ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating from the whole viſible church-communion agree with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies and precepts of union? Was this church like a grain of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard ſeed in its growth? Was all the wonderful works of redemption wrought for no viſible ſociety after one or two hundred years, in which a few perſecuted ones were viſible? Is not this the next ſtep (and a temptation) to utter infidelity? If Chriſt have now no viſible church on earth, but the people called <hi>Browniſts</hi> or <hi>Separatiſts,</hi> doth it anſwer the Scripture deſcription of him and his church? And is it not expoſing chriſtianity to the ſcorn of infidels, ſo to ſay ? Would not almoſt all rather turn Papiſts, than believe this? And be rather of their church, than of none.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But let us next ſpeak of the perſons. I may ſpeak my thoughts without impoſing on you. I think that the Major vote is no rule to the Minor, nor always is in the right. If a hundred men that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand

When Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> (and late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a very good man here) thought none fit to Baptize him again, but Baptized himſelf; was not that ſingularity a juſt cauſe of ſuſpicion? Yet I make not the old Nonconformiſts your rule.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. I argued alſo, from the common frailties of us all, that it will be unlawful to communicate with any Church on earth, even with thoſe of the objectors mind, if we are guilty of the ſins in Doctrine, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and diſcipline, of all Churches that we communicate with. I will aggravate none, nor render that odious which God accepteth: My work is to confute thoſe that do ſo. But I ſay, that 1. we have all many errors; And men uſe to put their errors into their prayers and preaching 2. Do not men uſe to deliberate more, and ſtudy what to write, than what to preach? And have men reaſon to be confident that our preaching will be more ſounder than our writing? This Author exclaims againſt me, as Popiſh, Arminian, for Juſtification by works, for merit, &amp;c. May it not be expected that I preach as bad as I write? And is it not then a ſin to be my hearer? Can I think
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:63048:60"/>
that he will not preach as ill as he writeth in this book? And are all ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners therefore for hearing him? I promiſe him that if I know of any Pariſh Miniſter that will uſually preach with as much error, reflexion and gall as he here writeth, I will be none of that mans hearers, or uſual Communicants.</p>
            <p>But to this he ſaith, P. 19. <hi>We diſtinguiſh between the rule of worſhip, and the adminiſtration and performance:</hi> — 1. <hi>It is not ſins of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary infirmity.</hi> 2. <hi>Nor ſins not foreknown, ſo as to prevent joining with them, but them that worſhip God by a falſe rule,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. This is the great ſtrength of all his Book, That we ſin by a falſe rule, but they ſin only againſt a true rule; but I think nothing is ſin indeed, but that which is againſt a true rule, even Gods word; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and uſing a falſe rule, is therefore ſin, becauſe it is againſt the true rule. Moſt hypocrites are ſuppoſed to own a true rule while they are falſe to it, and ſin againſt it. To ſin againſt knowledge, and an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged rule, is an aggravation of the ſin, and ſuch ſhall be bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with many ſtripes: <hi>Paul</hi> opens it to the <hi>Jews,</hi> Rom. 2. at large, therefore this will not excuſe our communion with ſuch.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This Reaſon croſſeth the buſineſs of the opponent; for whereas the greateſt reaſon againſt Communion with Pariſh Churches is the badneſs of the Communicants, and Miniſters lives; theſe are not the obeying of the Law or Canons, but diſobeying them: The Law, called the Rule, bids no man ſwear raſhly, lye, be drunk, unclean, ſlander, rail, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nay it commandeth the Miniſter to deny the Sacrament to ſuch: Ignorance, unbelief, hypocriſie, are not commanded, but forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by that Rule: Miniſters break the rule, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> they preach error, or hereſie, or againſt Love and Peace, and promote not Godlineſs, and mens ſalvation, with all holy diligence, by Doctrine and Life; ſo that no ſins againſt this is cauſe of ſeparation, if it be only uſing a falſe rule that is, juſt cauſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But what is the falſe Rule? The word <hi>Rule</hi> maketh all this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe and accuſation of his a meer equivocation: In general, a <hi>rule</hi> is any thing to which we purpoſely conform our actions, that they may be right: Of this there are divers ſorts.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Primary Rule is the abſolute Law of God, to which all mens actions ſhould be conformed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Subord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nate humane Rules: Theſe are of divers ſorts. 1. The obliging commands of Authority. 1. Of Magiſtrates. 2. Paſtors. 3. Parents and Maſters of Families. 4. School-Maſters and Tutors
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:63048:61"/>
of Youth, &amp;c. 2. Contracts or Agreements of men for concord.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Gods Law is never a falſe rule, but an erring Expoſitor may make the words the matter of a falſe rule by putting on them a falſe ſenſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Juſt ſubordinate rules are not falſe, juſtly uſed. 1. Magiſtrates rule either by <hi>common Laws,</hi> or temporary and particular Mandates, both being obligatory to duty, and indeed but ſeveral ſorts of Laws, while they uſe but that authority which God gave them. Laws or Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates are juſt rules.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Paſtors can make duty by ruling-authority for none but the Flocks committed to them: They may command what God authorizeth them to command; whether it be by word or writing, is all one: And whether you will call it a Law or not, the name altereth not the caſe: Tho indeed in the general notion, all is true law, which authoritative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by command maketh a ſubjects duty. Its a true rule when the Ruler goeth not beyond his authority<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.7, 17, 24. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.12, 17, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The ſame muſt be ſaid of Parents, Maſters, Tutors, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Agreements or contracts are rules made for Concord by the ſelf-governing power that all men have over themſelves: and they are juſt rules when juſtly uſed.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Beſides all theſe, moſt make a mans own reaſon, judgment or conſcience, the immediate ſubordinate rule of his actions. Indeed it is more fitly called the diſcerner of his rule and duty, as the eye is to the body: For it maketh not duty, but diſcerneth it made: But if any will call the <hi>Underſtanding a Rule</hi> to the <hi>Will,</hi> inſtead of a <hi>Guide,</hi> we may bear with the impropriety. All this is clear truth.</p>
            <p>Now the queſtion is, how any of theſe ſubordinate rules are <hi>juſt</hi> or <hi>falſe</hi>?</p>
            <p n="1">1. Two things God hath not only allowed, but commanded them all to do about Religion. 1. To command ſubjects as Gods officers to obey Gods Laws, and in juſt caſes to puniſh the breakers of them, in matters within their juriſdiction. And to do this by Laws, Mandates, Judgment and Execution. 2. To make ſubordinate Mandates or Laws for determining ſuch Circumſtances as God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to determine, by the General Law of Governing or Ruling, and of doing all to unity concord, edification, peace, order, and decency. Theſe things Chriſtian-Magiſtrates may do Nationally. Paſtors to their Flocks, Maſters to their Families and Scholars; and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:63048:61"/>
equals (Paſtors and People) may make fit agreements where they are free:</p>
            <p>And theſe rules may be called <hi>falſe</hi> or <hi>true,</hi> in ſeveral degrees.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It's groſs falſood and uſurpation, to ſet up an office forbidden of God, and falſe in its very nature.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It's next in degree falſe, for men of an office of Gods inſtitution, to command things utterly out of their calling and juriſdiction, in which they have no power from God mediately or immediately. Conſcience binds none to formal obedience (<hi>propter authoritatem imperan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis</hi>) to either of theſe; tho material obedience, and non-reſiſtance, may be duties.</p>
            <p>The lower degree, is when the office is of God, and the matter is in their power, and not only belonging <hi>ad alienum forum</hi>; But they <hi>miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determine</hi> it in the manner, not uſurping anothers office, but doing their own amiſs: Tho herein conſcience is not bound to obedience; <hi>gratia materiae ſub ratione indebiti modi</hi>; yet if the matter be not forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of God, obedience may be a duty herein, <hi>ſub ratione medii,</hi> neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſeveral ends; that is, <hi>to concord, to honour the governor, to avoid off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nce, and to avoid greater hurt to the Church, others, or our ſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if the thing commanded be forbidden of God, no man muſt do it. But divers things commanded unlawfully in the manner, may become duties by that command, becauſe they be made thereby need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful means of Unity, Peace, Honour to Rulers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as aforeſaid, which elſe would have been ſin (as to meet at an inconvenient time or place, to uſe a Tranſlation, metre, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> leſs fit.)</p>
            <p>Now all theſe being ſubordinate rules, they bind only ſubordinately by virtue of Gods ſupreme rule, who made them rulers (and he is no ruler that can give no rule); even as corporation By Laws bind only by vertue of the Soveraigns higher Law.</p>
            <p>And tho this Author would be the Ruler of Language ſo far, as to ſay that all <hi>ſinful Worſhip is not falſe Worſhip,</hi> they that uſe words, as greater Maſters have long ſtated the ſence, do know, that the falſeneſs is the diſconformity to Gods ſupream Rule, and that may be in all the degrees forementioned: And Rules or Worſhip are both falſe ſo far as they are diſconform to the Law of God.</p>
            <p>And now wherein is our Rule, falſe and theirs true? 1. We own no Rule of direct immediate obedience to God, nor of any univerſal or unchangeable duty to God, but what his Law (of Nature, or ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural)
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:63048:62"/>
doth make us. We hold that no man hath power to alter Gods word, to command any thing againſt it, nor any thing which God hath appropriated to himſelf, as to make new conditions of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, new Sacraments, new Laws, as Gods, or new duties for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, neceſſary to Salvation; no, nor any thing but what Gods own General Law doth command or allow them to determine, being left by him undetermined, to their Power and Rule.</p>
            <p>We hold that if any Ruler go contrary to, and beyond thoſe Rules of God, it is their ſin, and not ours, and we openly diſown it: And ſo do our Rulers in general themſelves moſt expreſly in the Books of Articles, Ordination, Homilies, Apology, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Binding all Miniſters to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for the Rule of their Preaching and Living, only infallible, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient in all things neceſſary to Salvation; and that if Councils, or any men err or diſagree with Scripture, they are not to be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>We openly renounce all falſe Rules, and Canons; but if for ſuch ſin againſt their own profeſſion of Scripture-ſufficiency, we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce Communion with all that are guilty, we ſcarce know the Church on Earth which we muſt not renounce. And the opponents in Particular.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For let us try now whether you have no Rule which you call <hi>Falſe,</hi> as well as falſe or ſinful practice. But I will firſt take in his ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler explication, left I miſtake him.</p>
            <p n="9">IX.

            <p>1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.12. Let a man ſo account of us, as of the Miniſters of Chriſt, and Stewards of the myſteries of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Heb. 13.7, 17.24. Remember them <hi>who have the Rule over you,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Obey them that have the rule over you, and ſubmit your ſelves, for they watch for your ſouls, as they that muſt give account,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Salute all that have the rule over you,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>1 Tim. 5.17. <hi>The Elders that rule well are worthy of double ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1 Cor. 14.26. <hi>Let all things be done to edifying.</hi> 4. <hi>Let all things be done decently and in order.</hi> 33. <hi>God is not the author of confuſion, but of peace, as in all the churches of the Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By all this, it is evident that Church Rulers there muſt be; and ſuch ſucceſſors of the Apoſtles in the ordinary parts of their office as Chriſt will be with to the end of the World, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.20. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in what their Rule conſiſteth.</p>
            <p>Now to the queſtion of <hi>Impoſing:</hi> (I premiſe, that tho this uſurper of a Magiſtry in Language will have <hi>Impoſing</hi> taken ſtill in an ill ſenſe; I leave that to him, it is enough for me to tell him that I take it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the prime ſignification [<hi>to put a thing on others</hi>] without reſpect to well or ill doing it.)</p>
            <p n="1">1. I know not whether by <hi>every Church,</hi> he intend a meer voting body of People and Paſtors by conſent, or the Paſtors alone as the Rulers of a voluntary People.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I know not whether he take [<hi>prudential determinations</hi>] as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from <hi>Governing Obligations,</hi> or not.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I know not whether by [<hi>preſent uſe</hi>] he mean it only for <hi>one pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent meeting,</hi> or for more, and for how many and how long: And [<hi>by ſtanding</hi>] how long he meaneth.</p>
            <p>I grant to him that no man may make <hi>univerſal</hi> or <hi>unchangeable</hi> Laws, but temporal and mutable, and only for his own ſubjects. But I main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That Paſtors may by word or writing make binding commands
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:63048:63"/>
or determinations to their Flocks of the foreſaid modes and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Religion and Worſhip. For 1. They are ſuch as are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary <hi>in genere,</hi> and the determination to this or that ſort disjunctively neceſſary: Somebody muſt determine them (and that for more than the preſent meeting, even ſtatedly): And it belongs to the Rulers of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to do it: None elſe is fit or hath any other power, than by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract.</p>
            <p>I have oft enough inſtanced in particulars. It is not meet that every meeting the People be put to Vote where to meet next: And there is no certainty that they will agree; but ſome be for one place, and ſome for another: An ordinary capacious place is neceſſary: It is the Rulers office to appoint it. It's no ſin againſt Chriſt for him to require them to come to the ſame place, from year to year, while it is fit.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſame I ſay for a commanding determination of the Lecture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days, or times of meeting, which the Paſtor may preſcribe ſtatedly by his office, without the Peoples votes.</p>
            <p>Or if all ſuch things were impoſed by a Major Vote on the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, their Vote would be a Governing Rule to the Minor part.</p>
            <p n="3">3. While Praying with the Hatt on, is by the cuſtom of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try a ſign of unreverence, the Paſtors (or Elders that Rule well) may command the Flocks by their authority, ordinarily, and not at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent only, to be uncovered at Prayer and Sacrament in the aſſembly, without wronging Chriſts Power, unleſs obeying it be wronging it.</p>
            <p>The ſame I ſay of uſual kneeling at Prayer.</p>
            <p n="5">5. If the Congregation be called to confeſs their Faith, or renew their Covenant with God, the Rulers may command all that conſent, to ſignifie it by ſuch a ſign, as ſtanding, or lifting up the hand, or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And they are bound to obey them.</p>
            <p n="6">6. I have oft enough inſtanced in Tranſlations, Metres, Tunes, Utenſils, Ornaments, and many ſuch like.</p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>The Paſtors make no Laws. Anſ.</hi> Dally not with names: Any thing is a Law which ruling authority maketh duty: If Writing it, maketh a Law, they may write it: But a verbal-Mandate is one ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of a Law: And impoſeth and determineth, and obligeth to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; and it is ſin to diſobey, becauſe God commandeth them to obey, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17. And even by the 5th Commandment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:63048:63"/>It doth as truly limit, and oblige when Paſtors command, as when Magiſtrates do it, tho they force not by the Sword.</p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>But theſe are but natural circumſtances, and belong no more to worſhip, than to any other things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> It's a ſad thought to me to think how many ſeem ſatisfied with ſuch an anſwer as this. All ſubſtances have their accidents, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, time, place, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But yet the accident of one ſubſtance is not the accident of another; The quantity and quality of a man is not the quantity and quality of a Toad, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When theſe accidents are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned to worſhip, they be not accidents of other things. Is <hi>Speaking</hi> no part nor accident of worſhip, becauſe ſpeaking is uſed in common things?</p>
            <p>Kneeling is uſed in other caſes: But kneeling in prayer to expreſs reverence, is not common to other things.</p>
            <p>Putting off the hat ſheweth Reverence to a Prince: But to be unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered at Prayer or Sacrament is the Accident at leaſt of that Worſhip, and not of other things: Metre and Tunes belong to Ballads: But the Metre and Tune of Pſalms doth not, but is appropriate to thoſe Pſalms.</p>
            <p>Time and Place belong to all natural actions: But the Time and Place ſeparated to Gods Worſhip is an accident only of that.</p>
            <p>It is not the natural ſpecification of an act or circumſtance, or the generical nature that we ſpeak of; but the individual accident or cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance as appropriate to a religious work.</p>
            <p>Is love to God no worſhip, becauſe love is a natural act? Is praying no act of Religion, becauſe we may pray to men? Is eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no part of the Sacrament, becauſe we uſe them as natural acts for our daily ſuſtenance? Is waſhing no part of Baptiſm, becauſe we waſh at other times: Thinking is a natural act, but holy thinking is more: Were <hi>Davids</hi> ſorts of Muſick no part or accident of Worſhip, becauſe Muſick is natural or artificial?</p>
            <p>It magnifieth theſe acts to be applied to worſhip, and it is a commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Worſhip-Ordinances that they are ſuited to nature, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance and ſanctifie it.</p>
            <p>Now at laſt I come cloſer to my queſtion: Have you no Church Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers among you? No Elders that rule well? Is it unlawful to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with you, if thoſe Elders by Mandates which are obligatory to the flock do preſcribe Days, and Hours, Temples, or publick places
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:63048:64"/>
for ordinary Worſhip, and if they command you to uſe the new Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation rather than the <hi>Geneva,</hi> publickly, or preſcribe the ſame Metre and Tunes, rather than your Congregation ſhall ſing, ſome one Pſalm, and ſome another: Or if they command them to be uncovered at Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament and Prayer, or to kneel at prayer? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If you take this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er from the Paſtors, and will ſeparate from them for ſuch obliging Laws or Mandates, you do that very thing which you fiercely talk againſt; you deſtroy or reſiſt Chriſts Kingly Government by his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers</p>
            <p>Oh what is Man! What are the beſt of Men! What doth the Church and World ſuffer by them! The ſame men that cry up Chriſts Kingdom, call it rebellion againſt him to obey his Officers: As if we muſt depoſe or diſobey the King, unleſs we diſobey all his Judges, Juſtices and Officers.</p>
            <p>All the obligatory deciſions that the Apoſtles made about their Love Feaſts, anointing the ſick, the Kiſs of Love, long Hair, covering or uncovering, order of prophecying, and of collections, &amp;c. were not ſtanding Laws to us; nor done by uncommunicable power; but were temporary Laws, and local, and ſuch as their Succeſſors, when fit, may make.</p>
            <p>If you have no ſuch Rulers in your Churches, you ſhould queſton whether your Churches have the true order of Paſtors, as well as you queſtion the Pariſh Miniſters: Do they not want ruling power, as well as theirs; ſpecially if <hi>you</hi> deny the very <hi>power,</hi> and <hi>they</hi> be but hindred in the exerciſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But ſome may be forced to ſay, <hi>Our Pastors do nothing, but by the peoples conſent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> They are their Paſtors by conſent, and rule them as voluntary, and not by force: But their rule and precepts are never leſs obligato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on Conſcience by vertue of Gods command to obey them: Muſt they preſcribe none of the things forementioned, till all have voted it, or conſented? They muſt command them to conſent, and they ſin if they diſobey, tho they can force none to obey.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But ſome may be driven to ſay, <hi>We allow ſuch preſcribing power to Paſtors, but not to Magiſtrates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. What Power the Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> uſed in Worſhip, <hi>David, Solomon, Aſa, Jehoſaphet, Hezekiah, Joſiah,</hi> I need not tell.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Chriſt came not to put down Kings, but to ſanctifie their office:
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:63048:64"/>
All power is given him: By him Kings reign: The Kingdoms of the world are his by right: Rulers are his Miniſters for our good: They muſt puniſh evil doers, and promote well doing: He commands us to honour and obey them; They are keepers of both Tables: They may drive Miniſters to their duty, and puniſh them for mal-admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration: Tho they may uſurp nothing proper to the paſtoral office, nor forbid them any ſuch thing, yet ſuch circumſtances as belong to the nation, or to many Churches, and not to this or that in peculiar, the Magiſtrates may determine: It is of great uſe, that all the approved Churches in a Nation, ſignifie their conſent in the ſame Confeſſion of Faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the ſame anniverſary days of Humiliation and Thanksgiving (as is done about the Powder Plot) and the ſame Tranſlation of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, if not alſo the ſame Pſalm Books; God ſtrictly commandeth Concord, and to ſerve him with one mind and mouth, and to avoid confuſion, and diviſion, and diſcord: What reaſon can any man give why Chriſts Officers appointed to rule by the ſword, may not thus diſcharge their truſt? Shall we ſin if the Law impoſe a Tranſlation, Pſalm Book, or reverent geſture, unleſs we ſeparate? Is commanded obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence become a ſin? And yet not if a Paſtor or a ruling Majority of people injoin it, or unleſs we leave all to confuſion?</p>
            <p n="10">X. Here therefore I utterly renounce the opinion that ſhall hold that ſuch things being lawful when uncommanded, become unlawful when commanded by ſuch as in Miniſtry, Magiſtracy, or Families, or Schools, are Rulers: Yea, if the Ruler miſdo his work, the ſin is his; I muſt not ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from every Kingdom, Church, or Family that is ill governed: Nor am I diſcharged from obedience in <hi>lawful</hi> things by the addition of ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful commands that deſtroy not acceptable Worſhip, and turn not our food to Poyſon: I tell thoſe Miniſters that publickly charge this on Nonconformiſts, that they muſt not charge any Doctrine of Seekers or Anabaptiſts, or ſuch ſeparatiſts, to be the Nonconformiſts Doctrine: I know not one meer Nonconformiſt of that mind: What we of this Age thought of Ep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="5">
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:63048:67"/>5. When I went twice a day to their Church at <hi>Acton,</hi> I was ſent to the common Gaol (accuſed for a Sermon for meekneſs and obedience, and ſubmiſſion to Government) and when I built a Chappel, it coſt me about 20 l. to get a Miniſter out of the priſon (that had formerly been impriſoned for the Kings ſervice) for preaching but one Sermon there, when I was twenty miles off.</p>
            <p n="6">6. All that I had, was diſtrained on, and taken from me, all my books, and the very bed I lay on, for preaching after (though, <hi>bona fide,</hi> they had been on juſt conſiderations given, or made over to another, and were not mine, but the preſent uſe of them only reſerved to me) and this by many warrants, as convict by the oaths of I know not whom, nor when, nor could ever know my accuſer or witneſs, nor was ever ſummoned to ſpeak for my ſelf, much leſs to examine the witneſſes.</p>
            <p n="7">7. I have been put in city and countrey to remove my habitation about twelve times, and my perſon twenty, in the midſt of my pains, to my great coſt and trouble.</p>
            <p n="8">8. How many thouſand pounds my conſcience hath coſt me in the loſs of a biſhoprick (by the Lord Chancellor offered) ſince 1661. beſides all other loſſes and charges, I leave you to compute, and ask you which of you hath loſt more? tho I acknowledg with thankfulneſs to God that I never wanted food or raiment.</p>
            <p n="9">9. And while I am now writing for Parochial churches and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and know no Law of the land that I break, I am hated; and while I keep my bed in pain, or my couch, there are new aſſaults which I think not fit to publiſh.</p>
            <p n="10">10. And all this is but as a flea-biting in compariſon of the ſufferings which I carry about me by continual pain or langour through age and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny uncurable diſeaſes: And under the expectations of death, how ſmall a matter is it to me, whether I dye in a Gaol for my duty to God, or in my hired houſe, out of which I have very few times gone theſe two years, but it hath been a priſon to me. What difference but conceit and conſent? If our Rulers think it for the intereſt of any cauſe or party that I dye in priſon, I ſhall acknowledg Gods will in the effect of theirs, and it ſhall not be in their power to make me ſuffer for any thing but my duty to God (beſides faults long ago pardoned, and common humane infirmities). And it is not mens calling duty by the name of the moſt odious ſins, that depriveth Martyrs of their reward with God. The falſe imputation of ſin by men, was not the leaſt part of the ſufferings of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and the Martyrs in all ages.</p>
            <p n="17">
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:63048:67"/>XVII. And becauſe others as well as I, have need of ſuch admonition, I will tell my Brethren, that our chief work is (the ſame with <hi>J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>bs</hi>) to fruſtrate the Tempter, and ſee that <hi>in all this we ſin not, nor charge God fooliſhly</hi>: And he that only triumpheth in ſuffering in conſcience of his innocency, and doth not know that ſuffering hath its proper temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and ſtudyeth not wiſely how to eſcape them, will ſuffer more by himſelf than by all his enemies.</p>
            <p>I will therefore tell you what are the temptations here which I fear and watch againſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Leſt the injuries of men ſhould <hi>deſtroy my due charity to them</hi>: Tho its true that the ſetled Study and labour of ſome, for factious or carnal ends, be to deſtroy Chriſtian Love, and ſerious Godlineſs, and the Souls, Bodies, and eſtates of the moſt innocent who they think ſtand in their way, (<hi>and falſehood, hatred and deſtruction</hi> are the Devils work and image) and no man muſt extenuate ſuch crimes, John 8.41, 42. Yet Diaboliſme is not to be imputed <hi>to all</hi> that men <hi>ſuffer by</hi>; much leſs to our <hi>Govornours, whom we muſt honour: Paul</hi> himſelf perſecuted in ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance; and Chriſt ſaid, <hi>they know not what they do</hi>? Much leſs muſt we blame others, if truly the cauſe be only in our ſelves.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Much more muſt we watch againſt deſires of revenge, or call for fire from Heaven, or imitate any that injure us, by requiring evil with evil, but ſee that we forgive as we would be forgiven. If they be impenitent, and God forgive them not, their ſuffering will be heavy enough.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We muſt watch againſt blinding paſſions, that it carry us not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to contrary extremes, that we may be far enough from ſin; and ſo leſt we fall into ſin on the other ſide. Too few can keep to the line of truth; moſt reel like drunkards from ſide to ſide.</p>
            <p n="4">4. We are much in danger of <hi>biaſſed ſtudy</hi>; never ſtudying <hi>impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially what may be ſaid againſt us,</hi> and <hi>for our oppoſers,</hi> but only all that may be ſaid <hi>for us againſt them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Men that have a good cauſe are too apt to betray and ſpoil it by <hi>an ill manner</hi> of defending it, by <hi>mixt errors, ill arguments</hi> or <hi>paſſions,</hi> to the hardening of the adverſaries and afflictors.</p>
            <p n="6">6. We muſt take heed that we fear not <hi>ſuffering wrong,</hi> more than <hi>doing wrong.</hi> He that <hi>doth the wro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>g</hi> is a far greater ſufferer or loſer, than he that <hi>is wronged.</hi> Our ſtudy muſt be, that we neither <hi>think, wiſh, ſpeak,</hi> or <hi>do</hi> any wrong to our adverſaries and afflictors.</p>
            <p n="7">7. We muſt watch leſt the <hi>great wickedneſs</hi> of any adverſaries ſhould be ſo much in our eye, as to tempt us to make light of our
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:63048:68"/>
               <hi>own ſin,</hi> becauſe it is not ſo great as theirs.</p>
            <p n="8">8. And we muſt watch leſt the conſcience of our <hi>good cauſe</hi> or <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency to man,</hi> ſhould make us foget our <hi>many ſins againſt God,</hi> for which he may permit men by injury to afflict us.</p>
            <p n="9">9. We muſt watch leſt we judge of the <hi>Cauſe</hi> by the <hi>Perſon,</hi> and ſhould take <hi>truth</hi> to be <hi>falſhood,</hi> and <hi>good</hi> to be <hi>evil,</hi> becauſe <hi>bad men</hi> or <hi>adverſaries</hi> own it; or leſt we take <hi>falſhood</hi> to be <hi>truth,</hi> and <hi>evil</hi> to be <hi>good,</hi> becauſe <hi>good men</hi> hold it; and leſt in Love or Pity we <hi>juſtifie the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n</hi> of any ſufferers.</p>
            <p n="10">10 But we muſt ſpecially take heed leſt fleſhly intereſt and love of r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ches, liberty or life, ſhould bias and blind our judgments, to take any thing to be Lawful which we think is neceſſary to our quietneſs and ſafety, and to uſe ſinful means to avoid danger and ſufferings.</p>
            <p>Theſe are my Studies, and I think them neceſſary to all.</p>
            <p>And the rather when (it grieveth my heart to ſee, ſo) many carryed by ſuffering ſo far from unity, charity, and moderation, that they even joyn with thoſe whom they ſharplieſt accuſe, (tho by other reaſons) to do their <hi>very work,</hi> and to deſtroy that which they think they are promoting. For inſtance,</p>
            <p n="1">1. They blame the Papiſts and ſuch conformiſts for ſaying that the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the Reformed Churches are <hi>no true Miniſters:</hi> And <hi>they ſay the ſame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. They blame them for ſaying <hi>their Churches are no true Churches. And they ſay the ſame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. They blame them for recuſancy, and ſaying it is unlawful to communicate with them; and <hi>they ſay the ſame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. They blame them that <hi>ſilence Miniſters,</hi> and forbid and hinder them from worſhipping God. And they themſelves diſſwade all the <hi>land from all publick Church-worſhip,</hi> where none but with thoſe that uſe the Liturgy can be had.</p>
            <p n="5">5. They juſtly blame <hi>Love-killing reproachful Sermons.</hi> And they write <hi>Love-killing reproachful Books.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. They juſtly blame <hi>falſe accuſers of particular perſons,</hi> and they <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>lſely accuſe almoſt all the Churches on Earth, as no true Churches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>They are juſtly for mutual forbearance,</hi> and againſt <hi>cruelty</hi>; and they unjuſtly aggravate the faults of almoſt all Church-worſhippers on earth, as ſo odious that it muſt be ſeparated from; and in a ſort excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate them</p>
            <p n="8">8. They fear Popery is ready to take poſſeſſion of the Land and Church, and they exhort all Proteſtants to forſake all the publick
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:63048:68"/>
churches, which are the Gariſon of the Proteſtant cauſe, that ſo the gates may be ſet open, and the Adverſaries may find the houſes ready ſwept and garniſhed, or the Gariſon emptied for their coming.</p>
            <p n="9">9. They are againſt the ejecting of the Miniſters 1662. and yet cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down a <hi>Comprehenſion,</hi> they would not have them reſtored, unleſs it were on terms that will take in them alſo (and who knoweth whom?)</p>
            <p n="10">10. Yea, the very top of Popery is to <hi>appropriate all power of church-government and worſhip to the Clergy,</hi> and to make Magiſtrates therein but the Clergies Executioners, ſaying they are only for <hi>civil government,</hi> for the body, but the Pope and Clergy only for <hi>Religious government</hi> of the church, and for the ſouls. And ſome called by dividing names among us, ſay, That Chriſt only and his Miniſters have power in ſuch matter<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and that Princes ſin if they command but a <hi>Tranſlation,</hi> a <hi>reverent ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture,</hi> a <hi>church-ornament,</hi> and ſuch circumſtances; and that it's a ſin to obey them.</p>
            <p>When I ſee that exaſperation by afflicters hath caſt ſome ſufferers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch ſelf-contradicting ways, I will ſet on my heart and judgment a double watch in ſufferings and abuſe.</p>
            <p>And now Reader I again ſay, That tho I was dragg'd to this ſort of work as againſt my will, I thank God (and my ſober ſort of Opponents) for calling me to it, that before I dye I might explain my Writings, and not by writing only againſt one extreme, leave them behind me as ſnares to tempt men to the other extreme.</p>
            <p>And I here leave my teſtimony again againſt all malignity that would charge theſe errors on the innocent for a cloak of hatred, and cruelty, and oppreſſion, that <hi>I know not one meer Nonconformiſt that holdeth any of theſe errors</hi>; and <hi>I</hi> verily believe that the <hi>Independents</hi> that <hi>I</hi> am acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with, are true ſervants of Chriſt; and many called <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, godly Chriſtians; and that ſome called <hi>Separatiſts</hi> retain Chriſtian charity, and meerly for fear of ſinning, flye too far from others.</p>
            <p>And as for all the reſt, it is not mens calling them all <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> nor their ſuffering together, that can make the innocent reſponſible for the faulty, who perhaps do more againſt their miſtakes, than ever ſuch Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers did (to cure them).</p>
            <p>And I muſt tell the <hi>Abaddons,</hi> that the oppoſition that hath been rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed againſt them among thoſe that I was acquainted with before 1641, and 1642, was cauſed chiefly by the badneſs of thoſe that made it their trade to preach againſt ſtrict and ſerious obedience to God, as <hi>Purita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm,</hi> and Hypocriſie, and made it the Ladder of their aſpiring Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:63048:69"/>
to make ſuch odious, and to hunt with jealous ſeverity thoſe that uſed for mutual help in the ways of Salvation, to pray together (eſpecially if they faſted) or conſulted how to obey Gods Law: Juſtacting over the part of the Bps that <hi>Martin</hi> ſeparated from, deſcribed by <hi>Sulpitius Severus,</hi> rendering all ſuſpected of <hi>Priſcillianiſm</hi> that were more than others in reading the Scripture, Faſting and Praying) and clapping on the back with encouragement the Drunkards and prophane ignorant rabble, who in every Town were the haters of the godly Conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts and Nonconformiſts; and making theſe the inſtruments of their malice, and praiſing them, and the multitude of ignorant, reading Prieſts, as more worthy Subjects, than men fearing God. <hi>Ri.

            <p>It's true that many were very hot againſt Biſhop <hi>Laud</hi> and the <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> and againſt Dr. <hi>Heylin,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Pockington,</hi> for proving <hi>Sunday no Sabbath,</hi> and calling the <hi>Table an Altar,</hi> and the <hi>Miniſters, Prieſts,</hi> and the <hi>Sacrament a Sacrifice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Blame not men that had read of their principles and practice, how <hi>Rome</hi> is a Leech that muſt live on blood, and cannot ſtand without it, if they were afraid of coming thither again, or drawing too near it. Upon my knowledg, the debauchery and malignity of many that hunted them, and would not let them ſtay at home in peace, and the terror of two hundred thouſand murdered in <hi>Ireland,</hi> was it that drove moſt that ever I knew into the Parliaments Army: And fear doth often drive men to ſeek for ſelf-defence to that which ſeemeth next at hand. Had thoſe whom they feared been ſuch as their functions obliged them to be, men of Holineſs, Love and Peace, they would have been leſs prejudiced againſt the reſt; they bore eaſily with Dr. <hi>Chappel,</hi> Mr. <hi>May<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>I here adjoin it to my confeſſions: 1. That I thought worſe of that called <hi>Arminianiſm</hi> than I ſhould have done: (and have proved in my Catholick Theology, (not yet writ againſt by any that I know of) that the difference is not in any great and intolerable error on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide). 2. That the practice of them that prophaned the Lords day, and the malignity of their abettors, made me too much offended at the books that called the <hi>Lords day no Sabbath,</hi> and the <hi>Miniſters, Prieſts,</hi> and the <hi>Table, an Altar,</hi> and the <hi>Sacrament, a Sacrifice</hi>: For
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:63048:69"/>
I now know that theſe allegorical Names were uſual with the beſt of the ancient Churches without contradiction: And that the <hi>Lords Day</hi> is indeed never called <hi>the Sabbath</hi> in the New Teſtament; and that the word <hi>Sabbath</hi> in the Bible ſignifieth <hi>a day of ceremonial Reſt,</hi> which was a <hi>Jewiſh Ceremony</hi>; and that all ſuch are by <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid to be put down, and that the <hi>Lords Day</hi> is a day of <hi>holy Aſſemblies</hi> and rejoicing in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, Evangelical Worſhip.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>prejudice</hi> in theſe controverſies prevailed, not from <hi>argument,</hi> but from the <hi>experience</hi> of the <hi>quality of</hi> too many that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed them: They thought it a moſt improbable thing, that God ſhould illuminate vicious, worldly haters of Godlineſs, and deſert thoſe that moſt deſired to pleaſe him.</p>
            <p>And of late times, what abundance have been driven from the publick Churches, by thoſe that rail at them when they come there, and would get the Birds into their Net by throwing ſtones and bawl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at them; and would get the fiſh to take the bait, by beating the Waters.</p>
            <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Worceſters</hi> ſilencing me, and preaching as he did, and the impriſonment of many of the people after, affected my old hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers with ſo much diſtaſt of that ſort of men, that all the Writings and perſwaſions I could uſe, would not reconcile them, nor ſcarce keep them from falling out with me for my perſwaſions: And now they have a Worthy, Pious, preaching Biſhop, a Man of Love and Peace, and a good Miniſter, they all crowd the Church, and are like to fall in love with ſuch Biſhops.</p>
            <p>And I muſt teſtifie, that with the generality of the Nonconforming Laity, I never found, but it was <hi>good preaching</hi> and <hi>good living</hi> that won their Love: And they will honour and follow ſuch men, whether Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, Conformiſts, or Nonconformiſts.</p>
            <p n="15">XV. Since the writing of this, I underſtand that ſome timerous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons have been afraid to communicate in publick, or joyn with the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy, by hearing that ſome that have done it, have been ſo troubled in Conſcience, that they have fallen into deſpair, and a doleful ſtate of trouble.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, 1. You ſhall never prove that I have perſwaded any Miniſter, to give Chriſts body and blood as a Drench to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing, or to make the Sacrament of Love, the Inſtrument of Malice or Cruelty, or a ſnare to ſtrangle Souls. It muſt be that Offence muſt come, but wo to them by whom it cometh. The old Church made men
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:63048:70"/>
beg for Church-Communion; if any withdraw from it, and excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate themſelves, they did not ſend them to Goal for their Converſion, to force them to ſay, that they repent, and to force them to Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But I muſt ſay, that theſe Miniſters or people that have ſo ill taught theſe troubled Souls (by Doctrine or Example) as to tempt them to take their Duty (or a lawful thing) for ſo deadly a ſin, are far from being guiltleſs of their Trouble, Diſtraction or Deſtruction. If any ſhould make them believe that it were ſuch a dangerous thing to pray by a Book, to ſing <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalms, to Communicatie with Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians, not to be rebaptized, not to keep the <hi>Saturday</hi> Sabbath, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And then, when he hath affrighted one to make away himſelf in melancholy deſpair, ſhould uſe this inſtance as an argument to affright a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way others alſo from their duty; I ſhould think that he were too blame: This were not by <hi>good words and fair ſpeeches,</hi> but by <hi>bad words and deeds,</hi> to deceive the hearts of the ſimple, in cauſing diviſions and offences.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I believe I have had with me in my time many ſcores that have had ſuch melancholly terrors, without any ſuch cauſe; and muſt the matter of their trouble therefore be proved faulty? I have known thoſe that for many years could have no peace of mind, while they continued Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox and Religious; and at laſt hearing Irreligious Sadduces, turned <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ilthy, and ranters, and were never under trouble more (that could be perceived) but boaſted of their peace. Who knoweth not that Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly maketh many of the moſt ſound and blameleſs perſons, like <hi>Spira,</hi> a weary of their lives, thorough deſparation.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I can tell theſe Objectors of eminent ancient godly men, that long forbore publick Communion, and at laſt uſed it, and have had more comfort and edification, than ever they had before; and the more for breaking through all the ſharp Cenſures of their former company, in obedience to their Conſciences herein: And when they have ſeen a ſcandalous perſon with them at the Sacrament, have gone with Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, Love, and Tears, and told him of his ſin and danger, and had ſuch ſucceſs as hath comforted them more than avoiding that Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion ever did: yea, I know thoſe that being threatned by violent Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, that uſe Diſſenters with rigor, have humbly and ſubmiſſively ſo pleaded with them from Scripture and experience, againſt that Spirit and Way, as hath overcome them, and melted them into a more tender and peaceable mind and courſe.</p>

            <head>A Poſtſcript on a Book of Mr. <hi>J.F</hi>'s.</head>
            <p>SINCE the Writing of all foregoing, I have received another Book ſent me by <hi>J.F.</hi> Whether he will be angry if I expound this <hi>J. Faldo,</hi> I cannot tell; I read it over to ſee if there were any thing in it that ſhould change my Judgment: But I will not promiſe to do ſo by any more ſuch. Nor will I ſo much as tell the Reader what my Judgment ſaid of it in the reading; much leſs write down the Anſwers which readily offered themſelves to my underſtanding as I went on; for it would but more provoke him, I ſee, and do the Reader little good, unleſs by helping him to lament the churches caſe through the infirmities of ſuch as I and he are; And the more patiently to bear all our preſent ſufferings, by conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering how unable we are to agree what to chuſe for our ſelves, if we had our wills, and how far we ſhould be from deſired concord.</p>
            <p>I will not write a Book to contend on the queſtion, Whether Mr. <hi>Faldo</hi> or I be the wiſer or better man: I am conſcious of ſo much ignorance and bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that if it may edifie the Reader, let him think of me as ill, as Mr. <hi>Faldo</hi> and all ſuch men would have him: If he have a good cauſe, I wiſh the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may be of his mind: If not, I find not my ſelf obliged to talk on againſt ſuch Writers any further, for his reſcue; nor do I think I can ſay any thing herein, which at his rate Mr. <hi>Faldo</hi> cannot anſwer.</p>
            <p>I only ſay, that he and ſuch other have ſatisfied me, That the Liturgy-VVorſhip in the common Lords Day office is comparatively purer than the VVorſhip of many is like to be, who oppoſe it. His Counſel is good, to know what the VVorſhip is before I conſent to it: I have tried what is in the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy; I</hi> concurred with many better men, <hi>1661</hi> in telling the VVorld, how far we could approve or uſe it. I find in it much good, and in the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Lords Day common ſervice, no fault that ſhould alienate me from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with the Church therein.</p>
            <p>To talk of faults in Baptizing, Burial, Marrying, <hi>&amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> is to ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to this point; I never ſaw any of theſe uſed ſince I joined with the Church in the Lords-Day VVorſhip: But how to try Mr. <hi>F. his</hi> VVorſhip before-hand, I know not He ſaith, that if we will be at the coſt of it, we may have better worſhip. And tho he ſeem diſpleaſed for being called a conſenter to my catholick communion, either he conſented that the <hi>Pariſh-Church-Worſhip ſhould rather be uſed than none,</hi> or elſe (which I ſuſpect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) when I have read his Book, I cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand ſo much as what he is for or againſt; what he meaneth by a <hi>Meeting</hi> of <hi>four,</hi> whether he take it for a <hi>Church,</hi> I know not: I take it not for a Church, that hath no Miniſter or Sacrament: And if he know of ſo many ſcore, or hundred thouſand Nonconformable Miniſters as may guide all the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:63048:71"/>
People in <hi>England,</hi> as ſuch Churches of four, I do not: And if Communion in the Liturgy be ſimply unlawful, it is ſo to all the Land. I think there are millions in the Kings Dominions, that can have no other Church-Worſhip than with the Liturgy, at what rate ſoever they would purchaſe it.</p>
            <p>If his conceits of my ſelf contradictions were as true as they are falſe, I will tell him other reaſons of what he counteth unaccountable, than that I wrote one Book in <hi>1659,</hi> and another in <hi>1684.</hi> I am now <hi>25</hi> years elder than I was then; and its a ſhame to learn nothing in ſo many years: I am more above all worldly hopes than he is: I am paſt all capacity of them. I have leſs cauſe of fear than he: They will hardly confine me to a Priſon narrower than my Bed and Couch. My glaſs is almoſt run: If I be not more apprehenſive of my ſpeedy account, and it awe me not to own nothing but the truth, without dawbing with one extream or other, I am much to blame. And I have ſeen ſome more of the experience of both extremes (tho alas I ſaw too much before).</p>
            <p>And after all, comparing all together, I leave poſterity my thoughts.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> That I had rather the Church had a Liturgy (to make all foreknow what Worſhip they meet for) with free prayer alſo in its place, than to have either alone.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> If they muſt be ſeparated when the Minister is of tryed ſoundneſs and ability; I had rather have his free prayer alone. But for many others, I had rather have the Liturgy alone.</p>
            <p>And for inſtance, Mr. <hi>Faldo</hi> hath oft told me, that his Church at <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi> (as I twice ſaid before) not only omitted, but renounced or oppoſed all ſinging of Pſalms for many years; that many of them were of ſuch ill opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, that he was put to much work to ſave them from being Quakers (and at what coſt they can now have Church-Meetings when he hath left them, I know not).</p>
            <p>For Mr. <hi>Faldo</hi> to hold up ſuch a Church even to ſuffering, and to write againſt Communion with the Liturgy, where there are able godly Miniſters, is either erroneous partiality in him, or I am blind in my unwilling ignorance.</p>
            <p>To which I further add again, that I cannot expect that men Preach ſounder Doctrine than they ſtudiouſly Write; nor that they pray more ſoundly than they preach; and if Mr. <hi>Faldo,</hi> and all ſuch Writers, ſo pray, and ſo preach, and ſo live, (much more if alſo their Churches have ſuch Maimed Worſhip as aforeſaid, and ſome of them unordained Miniſters, and many Churches men of many contrary doctrines) I take the Common-prayer Book Worſhip and Communion, to be much purer than theirs. The Lord make our ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors wiſer, better, and more peaceable than we are.</p>
