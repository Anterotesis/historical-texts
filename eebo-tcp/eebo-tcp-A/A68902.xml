            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

he comes into the <hi>Session-house</hi> with such a

his <hi>Cause,</hi> that no man can expect the least right

pretty perfume of a <hi>Judicious and Learned Divine,</hi>
he doth so swell and improve by degrees, that
he makes his work above all the <hi>Humane,</hi> and
equall to the Laws <hi>Divine.</hi> For speaking of the

               <hi>It is as true, or at least wise more fit, that the Bishop
should do as he would have him.</hi> Which is so high a

practice of all <hi>Ordinaries</hi> (who execute their own

            <p>And for the other, what meaning should he

            <p>The <hi>Vicar,</hi> a <hi>Chorister</hi> in the College, and bred
up in <hi>Musick,</hi> brought along with him from his
faculty, some odde <hi>Crochets</hi> into the <hi>Ministery.</hi>
And having too much favour from his <hi>Diocesan</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:20765:6"/>
(who had never seen a tolerable <hi>Incumbent</hi> of
that Church before) began to fly upon his own
<hi>Coat,</hi> and turn'd out of the Town two grave and
painfull <hi>Preachers</hi> salaried by the <hi>Parish;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the one was his own <hi>Cozen,</hi> and brought in by
himself a little before. His next <hi>quarrell</hi> was
with the <hi>Alderman</hi> and his <hi>Brethren,</hi> about some
matters of <hi>Malting</hi> and <hi>Tithing:</hi> which (by the
continued favour of the <hi>Ordinary</hi>) was ended to
his <hi>advantage.</hi> Then he fell upon this removing
of the <hi>Communion-table</hi> from the <hi>upper part</hi> of
the <hi>Quire</hi> (where it was<note n="a" place="margin">Aldermans Letter.</note> 
               <hi>comely placed</hi> and had
stood time out of mind) to the <hi>Altar-place,</hi> as he
called it. M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> 
               <hi>Wheately</hi> the <hi>Alderman</hi> questioning
him thereupon, what <hi>Authority</hi> he had from the
<hi>Bishop, Chancellour,</hi> or any of his <hi>Surrogates,</hi> to do
this <hi>alteration,</hi> received this Answer,<note n="b" place="margin">Aldermans Letter.</note> 
               <hi>that his
Authority was this, He had done it, and he would justifie
it.</hi> Upon the which <hi>return</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> 
               <hi>Wheately</hi> comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
his Officers to remove the <hi>Table</hi> to the place
again; which they did accordingly, but not
without striking, much heat, and indiscreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
both of the one side and the other: The <hi>Vicar</hi>
saying, <hi>he car'd not what they did with their old Tresle,
for he would build him an Altar of stone at his own
charge, and fix it in the old Altar-place, and would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Officiate upon any other:</hi> the rude people reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>he should set up no dressers of stone in their Church,
and they would find more hands to throw his stones out,
then he should do to bring them in; and would all in a
body make a journey to the Bishop, before they would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
it.</hi> Whereupon M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> 
               <hi>Wheateley</hi> the <hi>Alderman</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:20765:6"/>
presently wrote unto his Lordship of these
passages; as also of his light gestures in <hi>bowing at
the name of</hi> JESUS, so as sometimes his <hi>Book</hi> fell
down, and once <hi>himself,</hi> to the derision of those
that were not so well affected to that <hi>religious
Ceremony.</hi> And this was about <hi>June</hi> or <hi>July</hi> 1627.
To this the <hi>Bishop</hi> returned no answer in <hi>writing</hi>
at that time, but sent a quick and sharp Message
by <hi>word of mouth;</hi> both to the <hi>Alderman</hi> and
the <hi>Vicar;</hi> that they should not presume, either
the <hi>one</hi> or the <hi>other</hi> of them, to move or remove
the <hi>holy Table</hi> any more, otherwise then by spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
direction from him or his <hi>Chancellour;</hi> and
that it should remain where it did (if it stood
within the <hi>Quire</hi>) untill his next passage to <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln</hi>
by that Town; at what time he would him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
by <hi>view</hi> taken upon the place, accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
the same according to the <hi>Rubrick</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons.</hi>
And that the <hi>Vicar</hi> should not presume to
set up any thing in <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Chancell,</hi> in the <hi>inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim.</hi>
Which <hi>return</hi> did not altogether pacifie the
<hi>People</hi> of the Town in their jelousies against their
<hi>Vicar.</hi> But M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> 
               <hi>Wheateley,</hi> a prudent and discreet
man, afraid to offend the <hi>Bishop,</hi> (as one who had
been a singular friend and patrone to that Town,
when he was in <hi>place</hi>) resolved to ride unto his
Lordship. Which was no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ooner known, but all
they of the <hi>Town</hi> that were able, would needs
hire horses and ride along with him. The <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi>
when he saw such a <hi>company,</hi> enquired of them
what the matter was? They opened unto him
all this <hi>difference,</hi> assured his Lordship they were
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:20765:7"/>
every one of them <hi>quiet</hi> and <hi>peaceable</hi> men, <hi>conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi>
in all things to the Kings <hi>Laws Ecclesiasticall,</hi>
and willing to submit themselves to any <hi>Order,</hi>
concerning the situation of the <hi>holy Table,</hi> which
his Lordship should appoint. Onely they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
unto his Lordship, that they were much
scandalized with the putting down of their <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi>
and this new intended erection of a <hi>stone-Altar</hi>
upon the neck thereof. And that, if his
Lordship should appoint the <hi>Table</hi> to stand in the
<hi>upper end of the Quire,</hi> it was impossible that the
24<hi rend="sup">th</hi> part of the <hi>Parish</hi> should <hi>see</hi> or <hi>heare</hi> the <hi>Vicar</hi>
officiating thereupon. Desiring his Lordship to
take it to his consideration, that the <hi>Vicar</hi> (whom
his Lordship much favoured) was not alwayes
right in the <hi>Head-piece;</hi> and that they lived in the
midst of <hi>Recusants,</hi> their chiefe <hi>Governour</hi> being
one of that profession himself; and that those
kind of men began already to jeere and deride
this new <hi>Alteration.</hi> The <hi>Bishop</hi> entring into a
discourse of the <hi>indifferency</hi> of this <hi>circumstance</hi> in
its own nature, the <hi>Vicar</hi> came suddenly into
the <hi>Hall,</hi> pale and staring in his looks, and either
with his journey, or some other affrights much
<hi>disordered.</hi> Which the <hi>Bishop</hi> observing, used
him with all <hi>sweetnesse</hi> and <hi>lenity,</hi> bade him not
be troubled with any thing that had happened,
for he would end this difference to his content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
The <hi>Vicar</hi> brake out into <hi>passion</hi> and <hi>teares,</hi>
and said they threatned to set his house on fire.
The <hi>Bishop</hi> answered, that if they did so, he
would procure him <hi>another;</hi> and he hoped <hi>his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:20765:7"/>
would provide for them such <hi>houses,</hi> as in
that case they well deserved. The <hi>Alderman</hi>
&amp; his <hi>Assistants</hi> utterly denied the knowledge of
any such base intents, or <hi>menaces:</hi> but submitted
themselves wholly (as the <hi>Vicar</hi> likewise did) to
the <hi>Bishops decision.</hi> Then the Lord <hi>Bishop</hi> taking
the <hi>Vicar</hi> aside, talk't with him in private a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
while. What they discours'd of is not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
known. His Lordship was over-heard
somewhat earnest with the said <hi>Vicar,</hi> to tell him
who they were that set him on upon these <hi>altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
And it is conceiv'd generally, that the
<hi>Vicar</hi> told his Lordship all the truth, from point
to point. At the close, the <hi>Bishop</hi> said unto him,
Well, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. () you shall sup with your Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
in my <hi>Hall</hi> to night, upon such cold provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
as my people can make you: But I have sup't
already upon that you tell me. And if all the
<hi>Books</hi> I have of that <hi>nature</hi> be able to do it, I will
find some satisfaction for <hi>my self</hi> and <hi>you</hi> in all
these particulars, before I goe this night to <hi>bed.</hi>
And I will provide a Letter, as written to you,
M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> 
               <hi>Alderman,</hi> to shew to your <hi>Brethren,</hi> and some
<hi>Notes</hi> to be delivered to the <hi>Divines</hi> of the <hi>Lecture</hi>
at <hi>Gr.</hi> And both these (if the fault be not in my
<hi>servant</hi>) shall be ready by seven a clock in the
<hi>morning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Bishop</hi> sate up most of the night, and his
<hi>Secretary</hi> with him in his Study. What they there
did is not distinctly known: But it was observ'd
that the <hi>Secretary</hi> came down for the <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs</hi>
which stood in the <hi>Hall,</hi> and borrowed from
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:20765:8"/>
the Parish-church Bishop <hi>Jewells</hi> workes. In the
Morning between 7. and 8. of the clock, was
delivered to the <hi>Alderman</hi> this Letter sealed up.</p>
            <p>M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> 
               <hi>Alderman,</hi> I do conceive, that your <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion-Table,</hi>
when it is not used, should stand in the
upper end of the Chancell, not <hi>Altar-wise,</hi> but <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-wise.</hi>
But when it is <hi>used,</hi> either in the time of
the <hi>Communion,</hi> or when your Vicar shall be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to read the <hi>later part</hi> of the <hi>Divine service</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
the <hi>Churchwardens</hi> are to cause the Clerk or
Sexton to remove it, either to the place where it
stood before, or any other place in <hi>Church</hi> or
<hi>Chancel,</hi> where your <hi>Minister</hi> may be most audibly
heard of the whole Congregation. If both your
<hi>Churchwardens</hi> agree with the <hi>Vicar</hi> upon such a
<hi>place,</hi> let it be disposed of accordingly; and
your <hi>Ministers</hi> are not to <hi>of ficiate</hi> upon it in any
other place. If your Churchwardens <hi>disagree</hi>
with the <hi>Vicar,</hi> let them take the opinion of
that <hi>Surrogate</hi> of my <hi>Chancellour,</hi> who dwels next
unto your Town of <hi>Grantham,</hi> and he and any
one of the <hi>Churchwardens</hi> shall upon <hi>view</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe
the <hi>place</hi> where the <hi>Table</hi> shall stand in most
conveniency, when it is to be <hi>of ficiated</hi> on by
either of your <hi>Ministers.</hi> And so I desire you
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o intimate this unto the <hi>Churchwardens,</hi> and do
recommend me very heartily to you and all
your neighbours, and you and them in my
prayers to Gods protection. And am</p>
            <p>At the same time this <hi>Letter</hi> was delivered,
there was delivered also by the <hi>Secretary,</hi> a sheet
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:20765:8"/>
of paper closed up, to be conveyed to the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines</hi>
of the <hi>Lecture</hi> at <hi>Gr.</hi> upon their next mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting-day,
with a Note of direction from the
said <hi>Secretary,</hi> that if they conceived these pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages
contained in that <hi>Paper</hi> to be well and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>collected,</hi> and had not found in their <hi>readings</hi>
and <hi>observations</hi> the contrary, they should im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
them to the <hi>Vicar</hi> of <hi>Gr.</hi> being one of their
<hi>Company,</hi> and improve them what they could to
give him satisfaction, not denying (if he so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired)
to let him take out a <hi>Copie</hi> of the same
for his own use, but not to divulge these <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers</hi>
any farther. But if they found any mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings
in these <hi>Quotations,</hi> or had met with
any other <hi>Canons</hi> or <hi>Constitutions</hi> differing from
these, or that they themselves varied in opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from the premisses, they should forbeare
to impart them, but write freely back again
their said <hi>variance</hi> from these directions, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with their <hi>reasons</hi> for the same, which
should be very kindly and thankfully accepted.
Or to this effect. We met accordingly, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>used
these <hi>Papers,</hi> found them digested in the
<hi>former</hi> part into the fashion of a <hi>Letter,</hi> (yet di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
to no body) but not so figuredly and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly
in the <hi>later.</hi> They were not written
with the <hi>Bishops</hi> own hand, with which we were
all acquainted, nor subscribed by any body,
and they varied in some places in <hi>matter</hi> from
this <hi>printed Copie,</hi> but little in <hi>form.</hi> After per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usall
we did conferre with the said <hi>Vicar</hi> at two
severall dayes, especially about the Contents
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:20765:9"/>
of this <hi>Paper.</hi> Who undoubtedly, at that time,
received full <hi>satisfaction</hi> thereby, and conceived
that he had lost nothing by this <hi>decision,</hi> having
gain'd all the points, excepting the <hi>Form</hi> of pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
the <hi>Table;</hi> against the which he conceived
the <hi>Rubrick of the Liturgie</hi> to be apparant, but his
Lordships <hi>opinion</hi> to be very indifferent, because
he observed (as he said) the <hi>Table</hi> in his Lordships
private <hi>Chappell</hi> to be so placed, &amp; furnished with
Plate and Ornaments above any he ever had
seen in this Kingdom, the Chappel Royall onely
excepted. And so this difference was at that time
thus ended and composed, and the <hi>Vicar</hi> well satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
and never out of his Lordships favour (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
he reaped after this much fruit and profit) to
his very dying day. Now the true Copy of this <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
or <hi>Notes</hi> (for without all question they were
neither superscribed nor subscribed) here ensueth</p>
            <p>Sir, with my very hearty commendations un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you, &amp;c. When I spake with you last, I told you
that the standing of your <hi>Communion-table,</hi> was
unto me a thing so indifferent, the unlesse of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
and umbrages were taken by the Town a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it, I should never <hi>move</hi> it, or <hi>remove</hi> it. That
which I did not then suspect, is come to passe.
Your <hi>Alderman,</hi> whom I have known these 17 or
18 yeares to be a discreet and modest man, and
far from any humour of <hi>Innovation,</hi> together with
the better sort of the <hi>Town,</hi> have complained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it. And I have without taking any notice
of your <hi>act,</hi> or touching in one syllable upon
your <hi>reputation,</hi> appointed the <hi>Churchwardens,</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:20765:9"/>
whom in my opinion it principally doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern,
under the <hi>Diocesan and by his directions,</hi> to set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
it for the time: as you may see by this <hi>Copie</hi>
enclosed. Now for your own satisfaction, and my
poore advice for the <hi>future,</hi> I have written unto
you somewhat more at large then I use to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
my selfe in this <hi>kinde.</hi> I do therefore (to
deal plainly) like many things well, and disallow
of some things in your cariage of this businesse.
It is well done that you affect <hi>decency</hi> and <hi>comelines</hi>
in the officiating of Gods <hi>divine service,</hi> that you
president your selfe with the Forms in his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
<hi>Chappels</hi> and the Quires of <hi>Cathedrall</hi>
Churches, (if your <hi>Quire,</hi> as those others, could
contain your whole congregation) that you do
the reverence appointed by the <hi>Canons</hi> to that
blessed name of JESUS, so it be done humbly and
not <hi>affectedly,</hi> to procure the <hi>devotion</hi> &amp; not move
the <hi>derision</hi> of your Parishioners, who are not it
seems <hi>all of a piece</hi>) and that you do not maintain
it <hi>Rationibus non cogentibus,</hi> &amp; so spoil a good cause
with bad arguments. These things I do my self al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
and practise. But that you should say you will
upon your own cost build an <hi>Altar</hi> of <hi>Stone</hi> at the
upper end of your Quire; That your <hi>Table</hi> ought
to stand <hi>Altar-wise;</hi> That the fixing thereof in the
<hi>Quire</hi> is so <hi>Canonical,</hi> that it ought not to be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
(upon any occasion) to the <hi>body</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi>
I conceive to be in you so many mistakings.</p>
            <p>For the first; If you should erect any such <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi>
(which I know you will not) your <hi>discretion</hi>
(I fear me) would prove the onely Holocaust
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:20765:10"/>
to be sacrificed on the same. For you have <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed</hi>
when you came to your place, that that
other <hi>Oblation,</hi> which the <hi>Papists</hi> were wont to
offer upon these <hi>Altars,</hi> is a <hi>Blasphemous figment
and pernicious Imposture. In the</hi> 31<hi rend="sup">th</hi>

also, that we in the Church of <hi>England</hi> must take
heed lest our <hi>Communion</hi> of a <hi>Memory</hi> be made a
<hi>Sacrifice. In the 1. Homily upon the Sacrament.</hi>
And it is not the <hi>Vicar,</hi> but the <hi>Churchwardens</hi>
that are to provide <hi>Vtensils</hi> for the <hi>Communion,</hi>
and that not an <hi>Altar,</hi> but a faire <hi>joyned Table.

the <hi>Altars</hi> were removed by Law, and <hi>Tables</hi>

I think somewhat may be said for that, because
the <hi>Injunctions</hi> 1559 did so place it. And I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it to be the most decent <hi>situation</hi> when it is
not <hi>used,</hi> and for <hi>use</hi> too, where the <hi>Quire</hi> is
mounted up by <hi>steps,</hi> and <hi>open,</hi> so as he that <hi>offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates,</hi>
may be <hi>seen</hi> and <hi>heard</hi> of all the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Such an one, I am informed, your <hi>Chancell</hi>
is not. But if you meane by <hi>Altar-wise,</hi> that the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:20765:10"/>
Table should stand <hi>along close by the wall,</hi> so as you
beforced to officiate at the one <hi>end</hi> thereof (as
you may have observed in great mens <hi>Chappells</hi>)
I do not beleeve that ever the <hi>Communion-tables</hi>
were (otherwise then by <hi>casualty</hi>) so placed in
<hi>countrey-churches.</hi> For besides that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey-people,
without some directions before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
from their <hi>superiours,</hi> would (as they told
you to your face) suppose them <hi>Dressers</hi> rather
then <hi>Tables.</hi> And that Queen <hi>Elisabeths Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners</hi>
for causes ecclesiasticall directed, that the
<hi>Tables</hi> should stand, not <hi>where the Altar,</hi> but <hi>where
the steps to the Altar formerly stood. Orders</hi> 1561.
The <hi>Minister</hi> appointed to read the <hi>Communion,</hi>
which you (out of the <hi>Books</hi> of <hi>Fast</hi> in 1<hi rend="sup">mo</hi> of the
<hi>King</hi>) are pleas'd to call <hi>Second service,</hi> is directed
to read the <hi>Commandments,</hi> not at the <hi>End,</hi> but
at the <hi>North-side of the Table,</hi> which implies the
<hi>End</hi> to be placed towards the <hi>East great window.
Rubrick before the Communion.</hi> Nor was this a new
direction in the <hi>Queens</hi> time onely; but practised
in K. <hi>Edwards</hi> reign. For in the plot of our <hi>Liturgie</hi>
sent by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Knox</hi> &amp; <hi>whittingham</hi> to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Calvin,</hi> in the
reign of Q. <hi>Mary,</hi> it is said, <hi>that the Minister must
stand at the North-side of the Table. Troubles at
Frankford, p.</hi> 30. And so in K. <hi>Edwards</hi> Liturgies, the
Ministers standing in the <hi>Midst of the Altar,</hi> 1549.
is turned to his standing <hi>at the North-side of the
Table,</hi> 1552. And this last <hi>Liturgie</hi> was revived
by <hi>Parliament</hi> 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 
               <hi>Elis. c.</hi> 2. And I beleeve it is
so used at this day in most places of <hi>England.</hi>
What you saw in <hi>Chappells</hi> or <hi>Cathedrall Churches,</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:20765:11"/>
is not the point now in <hi>Question,</hi> but how the
<hi>Tables</hi> are appointed to be placed in <hi>Parish-churches.</hi>
In some of these <hi>Chappels</hi> and <hi>Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dralls,</hi>
the <hi>Altars</hi> may be still standing, for ought
I know; or, to make use of their <hi>Covers, Fronts</hi>
and other <hi>Ornaments, Tables</hi> may be placed in
their room, of the same length and fashion the
<hi>Altars</hi> were of. We know the <hi>Altars</hi> stand still in
the <hi>Lutherane</hi> Churches. And the <hi>Apologie</hi> for
the <hi>Augustane Confession, Artic.</hi> 11. doth allow it.
The Altars stood a yeare or two in the reigne
of King <hi>Edward,</hi> as appeares by the <hi>Liturgie</hi>
printed 1549. And it seems the <hi>Queen</hi> and her
<hi>Counsell</hi> were content they should stand, as we
may guesse by the <hi>Injunctions,</hi> 1559. But how is
this to be understood? The <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of the <hi>Masse</hi>
abolished (for which <hi>Sacrifice</hi> onely <hi>Altars</hi> were
erected) these (call them what you please) are
no more <hi>Altars,</hi> but <hi>Tables</hi> of <hi>Stone</hi> or <hi>Tymber.</hi> And
so was it alledged 24. <hi>Novem.</hi> 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 
               <hi>Edv.</hi> 6. 1550.
<hi>Sublato enim relativo formall, manet absolutum et ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriale
tantúm.</hi> And so may be well used in <hi>Kings</hi>
and <hi>Bishops</hi> houses, where there are no people so
void of <hi>Instruction</hi> as to be scandalized. For upon
the <hi>Orders</hi> of breaking down <hi>Altars,</hi> 1550. all
<hi>Dioceses,</hi> as well as that of <hi>London,</hi> did agree upon
<hi>receiving Tables,</hi> but not so soon upon the <hi>form</hi>
and <hi>fashion of their Tables. Act. and Monum. pag.</hi>
1212. Beside that, in the old <hi>Testament</hi> one and
the same Thing, is termed an <hi>Altar</hi> and a <hi>Table.</hi>
An <hi>Altar,</hi> in respect of what is <hi>there offered unto
God;</hi> and a <hi>Table,</hi> in respect of what is <hi>thence parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipated
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:20765:11"/>
by men,</hi> as for example, by the <hi>Priests.</hi> So
have you <hi>Gods Altar</hi> the very same with <hi>Gods Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
in <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 7. The place is worth the mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
For it answers that merry Objection out

We have no <hi>Altar</hi> in regard of an <hi>Oblation;</hi> but
we have an <hi>Altar,</hi> that is, a <hi>Table,</hi> in regard of a
<hi>participation</hi> and <hi>Communion</hi> there granted unto
us. The proper use of an <hi>Altar</hi> is to <hi>sacrifice</hi> upon,
the proper use of a <hi>Table</hi> is to <hi>eat</hi> upon, <hi>Reasons,
&amp;c. 1550. vide Act. &amp; Monum. pag.</hi> 1211. And
because a <hi>Communion</hi> is an Action most proper
for a <hi>Table,</hi> as an <hi>Oblation</hi> is for an <hi>Altar;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Church in her <hi>Liturgie</hi> and <hi>Canons</hi> calling
the same a <hi>Table</hi> onely, do not you now, under
the <hi>Reformation,</hi> call it an <hi>Altar.</hi> In King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Liturgie</hi> of 1549 it is almost every where;
but in that of 1552, it is no where called an <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi>
but <hi>The Lords Boord.</hi> Why? Because the
<hi>people</hi> being scandalized herewith (in <hi>Countrey-churches</hi>)
first it seems beat them down <hi>de facto;</hi>
then the supreme <hi>Magistrate</hi> (as here the <hi>King</hi>)
by the advice of Archbishop <hi>Cranmer</hi> and the
rest of his Counsell, did <hi>Anno</hi> 1550 by a kind of
Law put them down <hi>de jure.</hi> 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 
               <hi>Edv. 6. Novemb.</hi>
24. And setting these <hi>Tables</hi> in their rooms, took
away from us, the Children of this <hi>Church</hi> and
<hi>Common-wealth,</hi> both the Name and the Nature
of those former <hi>Altars.</hi> As you may see <hi>Injunct.</hi>
1559. referring to that Order of King <hi>Edw.</hi> and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:20765:12"/>
his Counsell, mentioned <hi>Act. &amp; Monum. pag.</hi>
1211. And I hope you have more learning, then
to conceive <hi>The Lords Table</hi> to be a <hi>new Name,</hi>
and so to be ashamed of the <hi>Word.</hi> For, besides
that <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe instituted this <hi>Sacrament</hi>
upon a <hi>Table,</hi> and not an <hi>Altar;</hi> (as Archbishop
<hi>Cranmer</hi> and others observe, <hi>Act. &amp; Monum. pag.</hi>
1211.) it is in the <hi>Christian Church,</hi> at the least
200 yeares more ancient, then the name of an
<hi>Altar</hi> in that sense; as you may see most learned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
proved (beside what we learn out of S. <hi>Paul</hi>)
out of <hi>Origen,</hi> and <hi>Arnobius,</hi> if you do but reade
a Book that is in your Church, <hi>Jewel against Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
of private Masse, Artic. 3. pag.</hi> 145. And
whether this name of <hi>Altar</hi> crept into the <hi>Church,</hi>
in a kind of <hi>complying in phrase</hi> with the people
of the <hi>Jews,</hi> as I have read in <hi>Chemnitius, Gerar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi>
and other sound <hi>Protestants;</hi> (yet such as suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<hi>Altars</hi> to stand;) or that it proceeded from
those <hi>Oblations</hi> made upon the <hi>Communion-tables</hi>
for the use of the <hi>Priest</hi> and the <hi>poore,</hi> whereof
we reade in <hi>Justine Martyr, Ireneus, Tertullian</hi>
and other ancient writers; or because of our
<hi>Sacrifice</hi> of <hi>praise</hi> and <hi>Thanks-giving,</hi> as Archbishop
<hi>Cranmer</hi> and others thought, <hi>Act. &amp; Monum. pag.</hi>
1211. the <hi>name</hi> being now so many yeares aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
in this Church, it is fitter in my judgement,
that your <hi>Altar</hi> (if you will needs so call it)
should according to the <hi>Canons</hi> stand <hi>Table-wise,</hi>
then your <hi>Table,</hi> to trouble the poore Town of
<hi>Gr.</hi> should be erected <hi>Altar-wise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, that your <hi>Table</hi> should <hi>stand</hi> in the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:20765:12"/>
               <hi>higher part</hi> of the <hi>Chancell,</hi> you have my assent in
opinion already: And so was it appointed to
stand, out of the <hi>Communion. Orders by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss.
for causes ecclesiasticall,</hi> 1561. But that it
should be there <hi>fixed,</hi> is so farre from being the
onely <hi>Canonicall</hi> way, that it is directly <hi>against</hi>
the <hi>Canon.</hi> For what is the <hi>Rubrick</hi> of the
Church, but a <hi>Canon?</hi> And the <hi>Rubrick</hi> saith, <hi>It
shall stand in the Body of the Church, or in the Chancell,
where Morning prayer and Evening prayer be appointed
to be said.</hi> If therefore <hi>Morning prayer</hi> and <hi>Evening
prayer</hi> be appointed to be said in the <hi>Body</hi> of the
<hi>Church,</hi> (as in most <hi>Countrey-churches</hi> we see it is)
where shall the <hi>Table</hi> stand in that <hi>Church</hi> most
<hi>Canonically?</hi> And so is the <hi>Table</hi> made remove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
when the <hi>Communion</hi> is to be celebrated,
to such a place, <hi>as the Minister may be most conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently
heard by the Communicants;</hi> by Qu. <hi>Elis. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct.</hi>
1559. And so saith the <hi>Canon</hi> in force, <hi>that
in the time of the Communion, the Table shall be placed
in so good sort within the Church or Chancell, as there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the Minister may be most conveniently heard, &amp;c.
Canon</hi> 82. Now judge you, whether this <hi>Table</hi>
(which like <hi>Daedalus his Engines</hi> moves and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves
from place to place, and that by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
wheeles of the <hi>Church Canons</hi>) be fitly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled
by you to an <hi>Altar</hi> that stirs not an
ynch, and supposed to be so resembled <hi>most
Canonically.</hi> And if you desire to know out of
<hi>Eusebius,</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Augustine, Durandus,</hi> and the fifth
<hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> how long <hi>Communion-tables</hi>
have stood in the <hi>midst</hi> of <hi>Churches,</hi> read a
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:20765:13"/>
Book which you are bound to reade, and you
shalbe satisfied, <hi>Jewel against Harding: Of private
Masse, Artic. 3. pag.</hi> 145. The summe of all is
this.</p>
            <p>1. You may not erect an <hi>Altar,</hi> where the
<hi>Canons</hi> admit only a <hi>Communion-table.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. This <hi>Table</hi> (without some new <hi>Canon</hi>) is
not to stand <hi>Altar-wise,</hi> and you at the <hi>North-end</hi>
thereof, but <hi>Table-wise,</hi> and you must officiate
on the <hi>North-side</hi> of the same, by the <hi>Liturgie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. This <hi>Table</hi> ought to be <hi>laid up</hi> (decently
covered) in the <hi>Chancell</hi> onely, as I suppose;
but ought not to be <hi>officiated upon,</hi> either in
your <hi>first</hi> or <hi>second service</hi> (as you distinguish
it) but in that place of <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Chancell,
where you may be most conveniently seen and heard
of all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Though peradventure you be (with him
in <hi>Tacitus) Master of your own,</hi> yet are you not
of <hi>other mens Eares,</hi> and therefore your <hi>Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shioners</hi>
must be <hi>Judges</hi> of your <hi>Audiblenes</hi> in this
case, and upon complaint to the <hi>Ordinary,</hi>
must be relieved.</p>
            <p>5. Lastly, whether side soever (<hi>you</hi> or <hi>your
Parish</hi>) shall first yeeld unto the other in these
needlesse controversies, shall remain in my
poore judgement, the more discreet, grave,
and learned of the two. And by that time
you have gayned some more experience in the
<hi>Cure of Soules,</hi> you shall finde no such <hi>Ceremony</hi>
to <hi>Christian charity.</hi> Which I recommend unto
you, and am ever, &amp;c.</p>

(the Favourites of the time) are of opinion, that
this word <hi>Capella</hi> is derived from <hi>Capa,</hi> which
signifies a <hi>Hood</hi> or a <hi>Mantle,</hi> and borrowed from
the first Christian Kings in <hi>France</hi> of the <hi>Mero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingian</hi>

For when the <hi>Rubrick</hi> and <hi>Common prayer</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,

and direction of all the Churches in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and it is said in them, that the holy Table in every
Church shalbe decently made, and set in the place where
the Altar stood, and there commonly covered, as thereto
belongeth, <hi>(there is added which he leaves out,</hi> and
as shalbe appointed by the Visitours) <hi>and if so,</hi> then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<hi>(without any</hi> ifs <hi>and</hi> ands,) it must stand along
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:20765:23"/>

is,</hi>
               <note n="r" place="margin">p. 56.</note> generally and for the most part.<note n="s" place="margin">p. 19.</note> And him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
affirms, that placing of the Table where the Altar

<hi>but as before,</hi>
               <note n="t" place="margin">p. 17.</note> in the place of the Chancell
where the Altar stood) is the most decent situation, when
it is not used, and for use too, where the Quire is mounted
up by steps, &amp;c. which might have easily been done.
<hi>Howbeit afterwards, like a curs'd Cow,</hi>

               <hi>that</hi> he thought somewhat might be

               <hi>and</hi> that (<hi>as he

            <p>So that, as the former Argument was taken

of the twayn, if it had a <hi>Cube,</hi> or any solidity

            <p>I answer first: That though I may grant the

               <hi>Queens Injunctions</hi> to have been an <hi>Ecclesiasticall
Law,</hi> yet shall I ever hold them to have been
<hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and not of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>
And<note n="c" place="margin">Post-nati, p. 106.</note> the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>England</hi> have a power
from God himselfe, not onely to <hi>make</hi> Laws,
but to <hi>alter</hi> and <hi>change</hi> Laws from time to time,
for the good of themselves and their Subjects,
as I shewed before. Especially those parts of the
<hi>Injunction,</hi> which (like trees) breed the Worms
in the Body of them, which in a short time must
needs destroy them, cannot but be subject to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration.
And this <hi>Injunction for Tables in the
Church,</hi> is clearely of that nature; <hi>That the</hi> holy
Table <hi>should be set in the place where the</hi> Altar <hi>stood,
and there commonly covered as thereto belongeth, and
as shalbe appointed by the Visitours.</hi> Which last words
this false-fingerd gentlemen left out in his
Quotation, as I noted before. So that this <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction</hi>
is but, as he said of<note n="d" place="margin">1 Sam. 13 1.</note> 
               <hi>Saul, the sonne of

for thy reasoning. How many <hi>Acts of Parliament</hi>

it? What was that last <hi>Proviso</hi> in the Statute of

               <note n="g" place="margin">P. 58, 59, 50.</note> you so much stood upon even now, but
to imply, that the <hi>Queen</hi> by her <hi>Commissioners</hi>
(when she saw cause) would appoint alterations
of Ceremonies, without making your Master<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
so merry disposed? However, this <hi>Injunction</hi>
had her <hi>plenitudinem dierum,</hi> having lived to the
last minute it was ever intended for, that is, the
setling of some other <hi>Order</hi> in the premisses by
the <hi>Queens Comm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

They setled the <hi>Table</hi> from the Wall, and<note n="h" place="margin">P. 26.</note> 
               <hi>so
it continued for many yeares in most places of</hi> England,
<hi>(perhaps when this</hi> Letter <hi>was written) though much
deviated</hi> (as you think) <hi>from the ancient practice,</hi> of
those few Moneths, <hi>scil.</hi> under the foresaid <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction.</hi>
But the <hi>Coal</hi> is not yet quenched; for he
flames in the faces of the <hi>Commissioners,</hi>
               <note n="i" place="margin">P. 22.</note> for
<hi>offering to place the</hi> Table <hi>where the</hi> Steps <hi>stood, and
yet fixing upon the wall</hi> (which the <hi>Advertisements</hi>
of 1565 do call the <hi>East-wall) the Tables of Gods
Precepts imprinted for the said purpose; which could
not be, if the</hi> Communion-table <hi>were not to stand
abo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap> the Steps, and under the Commandments, and
therefore all along the wall,</hi> (and why not aswell <hi>in
the place of the steps,</hi> and <hi>end-wise to the wall?) on which
the ten Commandments were appointed to be placed.</hi>
Here is the longest conclusion, that ever I heard
made of such short and pettie premisses. I hope
he doth not think that the <hi>Tables of the Law</hi> did
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:20765:24"/>
hang <hi>Geometrically,</hi> by a perpendicular line cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
right angles with the <hi>Communion-Table.</hi> For
if they did, they would not serve his turn even
in that pendancy. So that to be fixed <hi>on the Wall,</hi>
or <hi>the East-wall,</hi> over the <hi>Communion-boord,</hi> can
signifie nothing else, but that they should be fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
higher then the <hi>Communion-Table,</hi> upon
some part of the East-wall, so as the people

this may be the better done, though the <hi>Table</hi>

And so in B. <hi>Sand's visitation</hi> 13<hi rend="sup">o</hi> of the <hi>Queen,</hi>
the <hi>Article</hi> runs no more then thus, <hi>Whether have
you in your Church or Chappell the Table of the ten

cannot but have <hi>Tanto di naso,</hi> a nose as long as
the <hi>Rhinoceros,</hi> in making themselves merry with

Nonsequitur.</hi> They may be over the <hi>End</hi> of the <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi>
And that shalbe the end of my first answer.</p>
            <p>Secondly, how doth it follow, that<note n="n" place="margin">P. 8, &amp; 9.</note> if the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:20765:25"/>
               <hi>Injunction</hi> require that the <hi>Table</hi> should be set
in the place where the <hi>Altar</hi> stood, it must
<hi>stand along close by the wall?</hi> have you no better
proof for it,<note n="o" place="margin">P. 19.</note> then that <hi>Altars alwaies stood
so?</hi> Although this be a most bold and ignorant
assertion (as shall be shewed in due time) yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
admitted, it doth not prove your sequele.
For it might stand <hi>above</hi> the <hi>steps,</hi> with the <hi>end
Eastward,</hi> and the <hi>side Northward,</hi>
               <note n="p" place="margin">P. 26.</note> 
               <hi>as it was in
most places of</hi> England, <hi>when this</hi> Letter <hi>was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,</hi>
and yet obey the words of the <hi>Injunction,
and be in the place where the</hi> Altar <hi>stood.</hi> If the
<hi>Injunction</hi> had said, It was to be in the very
place of the <hi>Altar,</hi> it had not done your feat.
For, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> tells us, <hi>there is a double place;</hi>
there is<note n="q" place="margin">Natur. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scult. lib. 4. c. 4.</note> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> there is a place of
the <hi>Altar,</hi> which might hold <hi>more</hi> then the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar</hi>

                  </gap>. Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>just no
more</hi> in any dimension, then the thing placed.
And the <hi>Injunction</hi> directed to her Majesties <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,</hi>
and not to her <hi>Mathematicians,</hi> is likelier
to use the term of a <hi>common</hi> and <hi>ordinary,</hi> then
of a <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>Mathematicall</hi> place. This very
<hi>Injunction</hi> saith in the next words, that <hi>in the
time of the Communion it shall be in the</hi> Chancell.
<note n="s" place="margin">Before the Communion.</note> The <hi>Rubrick</hi> saith, <hi>in the</hi> body <hi>of the</hi> Church
<hi>or</hi> Chancell. The<note n="t" place="margin">Canon 82.</note> 
               <hi>Canon</hi> in force, <hi>in

and <hi>Mechanicall,</hi> and not <hi>Mathematicall</hi> pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
And so the <hi>place</hi> of the <hi>Altar</hi> in this <hi>Injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi>
is not all, and in all dimensions, but some
part onely of the Room which that <hi>Altar</hi> filled,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:20765:25"/>
But here it is not so difficult neither. The
words are, <hi>In the place,</hi> UBI, <hi>where the</hi> Altar
<hi>stood;</hi> as in the<note n="u" place="margin">Also that the Steps, &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>Orders</hi> of <hi>Tertio, where the</hi> Steps
<hi>stood.</hi> So that the <hi>Injunction</hi> doth not describe
the <hi>Mathematicall</hi> place, but the <hi>Vbi</hi> onely,
and <hi>artificiall</hi> place of the <hi>Altar.</hi> And<note n="x" place="margin">De subtilit. Exercit. 359. § 5.</note>

And therefore for the great

finding <hi>that the</hi>

either wilfully corrupting the text, or swallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

in all words and syllables; who (had he any

               <hi>Queen</hi>
and the <hi>Counsell</hi> do not, unto me, seeme to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove,
but rather to disprove the standing of
<hi>Altars,</hi> in this <hi>Injunction.</hi> They say indeed, that
absolutely, and abstractedly from circumstances
and considerations, it seemeth no matter of great
moment, unto them, whether the Sacrament be
administred upon the <hi>Altars,</hi> or the <hi>holy Tables,</hi>
so as it be <hi>duely</hi> and <hi>reverently</hi> performed. <hi>Duely,</hi>

the case not abstracted and naked, but cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
and adorned with all its circumstances unto

down the <hi>Altars,</hi> and set up the <hi>holy Tables,</hi> for
two main reasons.<note n="e" place="margin">
                  <hi>In these words,</hi> Yet for observation of one uniformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty through the whole Realme, and for the better imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Law in that behalf, it is ordered, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

That it had been<note n="f" place="margin">P. 22.</note> 
               <hi>ridiculous indeed to imagine,</hi> that
the <hi>Queen</hi> and her <hi>Counsell</hi> (the very flower and

being in contention on whether part to turne their

confirmes very much the conceit of the <hi>Letter,</hi>
seeme it to <hi>Doctor Coal</hi> never so shallow. That
the <hi>Table</hi> should stand above the <hi>steps,</hi> if there
were any; That it should not stand along close

but two long <hi>sides,</hi>
               <note n="o" place="margin">Letter pag. 71. 70.</note> one of them should be

               <hi>When you build an high Altar, there must
be from the foot or lowest degree thereof, to the Rails
that enclose the same, eight cubits, and more, if the
Church will bear it, that there may be room for the

Masses.</hi> When the <hi>Altars</hi> therefore, with their
appurtenances, were taken down (for I will not

is this:<note n="l" place="margin">p. 63.</note> 
               <hi>That his sacred Majestie</hi> (whom God

to the Metropolitanes, Bishops, and other

            </p>
            <p>If this were true, it might very well serve for a
Wall of brasse to keep off the tongues and pens of
all the <hi>Clergie</hi> and <hi>Laity</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> from intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in this Theme or Question any more. For
who could have so steely a brow, as to outface
such a sacred Sentence; especially in a matter of a
nature indifferent, &amp; acknowledged by all Laws
divine and humane, to depend immediately upon
the <hi>Royall decision?</hi> But it is most untrue, that <hi>his
Majesty</hi> hath declared in that <hi>Act</hi> one word of his
pleasure <hi>Hereupon,</hi> that is, against the Contents of
this <hi>Letter;</hi> although it was (if I be rightly infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med)
either punctually read, or opened very ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
unto his most excellent <hi>Majesty</hi> at that <hi>Hearing</hi>
But this <hi>Pamphleter,</hi> whose whole <hi>book</hi> is but a <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel</hi>
against a <hi>Bishop,</hi> and every <hi>page</hi> thereof a <hi>malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

in the Conclusion of his work, <hi>ponere os in coelum,</hi>

the remainder will prove a full confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this <hi>Letter</hi> he so much frets against, and a
most condigne reprehension of that Squirrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed
yong man, that without consent of his
<hi>Fellow minister,</hi> and in contempt of his <hi>Diocesan,</hi>
and all that populous <hi>Parish,</hi> would throw the
<hi>Communion-table</hi> out of doores, and build him a
close <hi>Altar,</hi> out of faction and singularity. <hi>His
Majesties</hi> Rescript, <hi>Mentis aureae verba bracteata,</hi> fit
to be written in plates of gold, is this, and this
onely, concerning the point in controversie.</p>
            <p>And likewise, for so much as concerns the liberty gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven<note place="margin">p. 65.</note>
by the said Communion-book, or Canon, for placing
the Communion-table in any Church or Chappell with
most conveniency: That liberty is not to be understood, as
if it were ever left to the discretion of the Parish, much
lesse to the particular fancy of any humorous person, but
to the judgement of the Ordinary, to whose place and fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
it doth properly belong to give direction in that
point, both for the thing it self, and for the time, when and
how long, as he may finde cause.</p>
            <p>With this Sentence I will conclude the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:

Games finding his adversaries members
so slick and slippery with oile and sweat,
as it was impossible to lay any fixed hold upon

and fastning: So this <hi>Pamphleter</hi> having slipt and

impossible to refute them without committing

And should we all be so affected as to demurre on
the Commands of our Superiours, in matters of exteriour
order, and publick government, till we are satisfied in the
grounds and reasons of their Commands, or fly off from our
duty, we should soon find a speedy dissolution both of
Church and State. You know who said it well enough;</hi> Si

               <hi>Majestie

(whereof I have shewed the contrary in the

            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>The Vicar of</hi> Gr. <hi>himself</hi>
               <note n="e" place="margin">pag. 9.</note> 
               <hi>might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire

               <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
for any thing the</hi> Canon <hi>tells us, the</hi> Vicar (who
is never nam'd or dream't of in the <hi>Canon,</hi> or ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticled
unto concerning this particular in either
the <hi>Diocesan</hi> or <hi>Metropolitan</hi> Visitation) <hi>was to have
a greater hand in ordering of the said</hi> Table <hi>then the
Bishops immediate Officers, the</hi> Churchwardens, <hi>were
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:20765:34"/>
or ought to have; as one that better understood, what was
convenient in and for Gods Service, then they did or
could. Nor did the</hi> Vicar <hi>any thing against the</hi> Canon
(as he did not by taking his Mornings draught
before he went about it) <hi>in causing the</hi> Table <hi>to be
disposed of to a more convenient place then before it stood
in. Onely this</hi> Epistoler <hi>is pleas'd to countenance the
Vestry-doctrine of these dayes, in which the Churchwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens
and other Elders</hi> (that grow in the <hi>Doctours</hi> bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
wit, never dream't of in the <hi>Letter) would do
all, leaving their Minister</hi> (God blesse good holy
Church-men from such a misadventure) <hi>to his stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
and Meditations.</hi> A thing more fitting for S.
<hi>Basil</hi> or S. <hi>Bernard,</hi> then for a <hi>Vicar,</hi> who was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
intended for a <hi>looker on,</hi> or a <hi>dull spectatour</hi> of
their active undertakings in removing (when
they are commanded by the <hi>Ordinary</hi>) a joyned
<hi>Table.</hi>
               <note n="g" place="margin">pag. 11.</note> 
               <hi>For the Curate being once appointed as a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
man to take</hi> Altars <hi>down,</hi> who but he should
set them up? <hi>It is true indeed that the Bishop of the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cese
is the man, to whom by right</hi> (and by the <hi>Liturgie)
the ordering of these things doth belong; but then it is as
true</hi> (or if it be not true, as it is most false and foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish)
yet (saith the<note n="h" place="margin">Title pag.</note>

send his resolutions to the Priest, then to the</hi> (I know
not what) <hi>people,</hi> a kind of <hi>Myrmidons</hi> swarm'd out
of the <hi>Doctours</hi> fancie, and never mentioned in the
<hi>Letter</hi> confuted. And to say that they are the
<hi>Diocesans subordinate officers</hi> in this kind, is another
<hi>smack of the Vestry-doctrine;</hi> And placed there on
front; to delight the people, encouraged thereby
to contemn their <hi>Parsons,</hi> who are left to meere
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:20765:34"/>
               <hi>contemplative Meditations,</hi> and not employed (as
they should be) in removing and providing of
<hi>Frames</hi> and <hi>Tables.</hi> And therefore, O bloudy Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,
to gore thy Clergy in this kind, as not to
suffer them to execute all these Mandates of
<hi>Commissaries</hi> and <hi>Officialls,</hi> concerning <hi>Bells,
Frames, Bell-ropes, Beeres, Shove ls,</hi> and <hi>square Tables;</hi>
but leave those active spirits to moulder away
(against all conscience) in divine Meditations!
<hi>Parce precor stimulis.</hi> Oh be not so hard-hearted
and mercilesse<note n="i" place="margin">pag. 48.</note> to advance on this sort the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
of the Churchwardens so high above their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.</hi>
Especially<note n="k" place="margin">pag. 51.</note> seeing the <hi>Vicar in correspondence
unto former practice</hi> (some 80 yeares before) <hi>thought
the place where formerly the</hi> Altar <hi>stood, to be fittest for

<note n="l" place="margin">pag. 3.</note> 
               <hi>though the</hi> Epistoler <hi>seem to be a</hi> Diocesan,
<hi>and the other a private</hi> Parish-priest <hi>in his Iurisdiction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly and lastly, If both the <hi>Ordinary</hi> and
<hi>Vicar</hi> (which is not to be conceived) should want
a power to set the holy Table <hi>Altar-wise,</hi>
               <note n="m" place="margin">pag. 4. &amp; 28.</note> what
can be said to that <hi>uniformity of publick order, to

Shall such<note n="n" place="margin">pag. 3.</note> 
               <hi>a poore trifling piece of work as this,</hi>
discountenance these sublime intentions? <hi>Non
sinam, non patiar, non feram.</hi> And thus our <hi>Coal</hi>
sparkles and layes about him.</p>
            <p>But surely these demonstrations were born in
<hi>Thebes,</hi> and not in <hi>Athens,</hi> and being of the true

For if the <hi>Vicar</hi> had power to transpose <hi>Tables</hi>
and set up <hi>Altars</hi> without and contrary to the
will of his Ordinary, why should he not (in the
name of God) <hi>demurre upon the Commands of his

First, as touching the Reverend Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of this Land, if there be any that dislike of
their Callings, or conceive of the same as not

I would he were with Master <hi>Cotton</hi> in the

or challenged unto themselves any such exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant

and <hi>Canons</hi> established (especially over <hi>Acts of

saith, that the <hi>Doctours</hi> call it so, and especially
S. <hi>Austin,</hi> as he speaks a little before: <hi>he</hi> doth
not call it so <hi>himselfe.</hi> And what doth he adde,
concerning those <hi>Doctours</hi> that call it so, in the
very next words to these which are quoted by
you? speak truth, man, and shame the Divell;
for he is the old <hi>Clipper of speaches.</hi> Well, I
must do it for you. <hi>The Doctours might be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:20765:49"/>
in some points: I beleeve them, when they say well:</hi>
or, as it is in the Margent, <hi>Doctores legendi sunt
cum venia,</hi> The <hi>Doctours</hi> must be pardon'd, if they
sometimes slip in their expressions. And this
is all that you have gain'd by Reverend <hi>Latimer.</hi>
The last you produce in this kinde, is Bishop
<hi>Ridley.</hi> And he is for you <hi>not onely, but also.</hi> First
he saith, <hi>that in the Sacrament of the Altar is the
naturall body and bloud of Christ.</hi> But why do
you leave out still those few words that go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore?
You know they are these;<note n="z" place="margin">Act. &amp; Mon. part 3. fol. 492.</note> 
               <hi>To the Question
thus I answer.</hi> What is the <hi>Question</hi> then? Turn
the leaf, and look. <hi>Article 1. We do object to thee,
Nicolas Ridley,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That thou hast openly defended,
that the true and naturall body of Christ is not really
present in the Sacrament of the Altar.</hi> What saith
he? <hi>To the Question I answer, That in the Sacrament
of the Altar,</hi> &amp;c. So that the word is the word
<hi>articulated upon him,</hi> not <hi>his.</hi> And he could not
possibly avoid the repeating of it, unlesse he
should <hi>mutare terminos,</hi> and so confound all me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
of Disputation. But in all his own <hi>voluntary
expressions</hi> in all that <hi>Conference,</hi> he never calls it,
<hi>The Sacrament of the Altar,</hi> but <hi>the Sacrament of
the Communion</hi> onely. The which <hi>Communion</hi> he
there affirms to be <hi>onely a memory of Christs Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</hi>
Which is the Doctrine I have all this while
endeavoured to prove, to have no relation at all
to a <hi>materiall Altar.</hi> In answering that place in
<hi>Cyrill,</hi> objected by the Bishop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
that <hi>Bishop</hi> would fain prove, that as <hi>erecting
of Altars</hi> in <hi>Britanny</hi> did imply that <hi>Christ</hi> was
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:20765:50"/>
               <hi>come</hi> and <hi>beleev'd</hi> on in those parts; so the <hi>plucking
of them down,</hi> as B. <hi>Ridley</hi> had done, was suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to imply, that <hi>Christ</hi> as yet was <hi>not come</hi> in
the flesh) he saith, as you say, <hi>That the word</hi>
Altar <hi>in Scripture, signifieth as well the</hi> Altar
of the <hi>Jews, as the</hi> Table <hi>of the Lords Supper:</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luding,
without all question, to <hi>Hebr.</hi> the 13.
as <hi>Philpot</hi> but even now expounded that place.
But that the Bishop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> should apply that
<hi>Altar</hi> whereof S. <hi>Cyrill</hi> spake, to those <hi>materiall
Altars</hi> pull'd down in the <hi>Reformation</hi> under <hi>Edw.</hi>
the sixth, B. <hi>Ridley</hi> (in the midst of his great
<hi>Afflictions</hi>) could not heare without a little <hi>smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</hi>
D. <hi>Ridley smiling answered.</hi> And then ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
up his countenance againe, he tells him
freely; That <hi>the removing of Altars was done upon
just considerations;</hi> and, That <hi>the Supper of the
Lord was not at any time better, ministred, nor more
duly received, then when these Altars were taken down.</hi>
And would you know how he placed his <hi>Table,</hi>
when these <hi>Altars</hi> were gone?<note n="a" place="margin">Act &amp; Mon. part. 2. p. 700.</note> 
               <hi>When some used
the Table Altar-wise, he determined, that to use it as
a Table, was most agreeable to Scripture.</hi> And as
B. <hi>Ridley</hi> smil'd dat the B. of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> so would the
B. of <hi>Lincoln</hi> (were he alive) smile heartily at you,
that would bring such a passage as this to defend
your <hi>Altars.</hi>

            <p>Having thus impannell'd his <hi>Jury,</hi> he begins
to open his <hi>Evidence,</hi> for <hi>the Sacrament of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi>

he produced those worthy <hi>Martyrs,</hi> that is, to
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:20765:50"/>
witnesse point-blank against himself. For in this
<hi>Quotation,</hi> he doth but peep over the Wicket, and
touch upon the Title of the <hi>Statute:</hi> he dares
not for his eares open the doore, and enter in to
the <hi>Body</hi> thereof. It is enough for him, that in
the <hi>Title, The Sacrament of the body and bloud of
Christ</hi> is (at that time before the Statute of the
six <hi>Articles</hi> was actually repealed) said to be
<hi>commonly called, The Sacrament of the Altar.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
saith he, <hi>That Name of the Sacrament of the
Altar doth occurre in that Statute still in force.</hi>
First, I deny it to be the <hi>Name</hi> in that place, but
the <hi>Addition</hi> onely of <hi>the blessed Sacrament, of the
body and bloud of Christ. The Sacrament of the body
and bloud of Christ</hi> is the <hi>Name,</hi> and <hi>true Name;</hi>
the other is onely an <hi>Addition</hi>

cannot inferre a <hi>proper Altar.</hi> Then for the
<hi>Pontificians,</hi> they are all of this opinion; I will
single out a few of the Prime. <hi>An Altar of Stone
is never erected to praise God or say our prayers at,</hi> saith
<note n="g" place="margin">In Epist. ad Hebr. c. 13. ad octav.</note> 
               <hi>Salmeron.</hi> If not of <hi>Stone,</hi> neither of <hi>Timber;</hi> for
that makes not the difference. <hi>There is none so

               <hi>Calvin; They that extend
the name of Sacrifice to all Ceremonies and religious

To Sacrifices taken improperly and metaphorically, the

are no way requisite,</hi> saith<note n="k" place="margin">Les circ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:20765:59"/>
of one Argument, wherewith I will conclude this
Passage. God would not suffer the first Age of
the world, for 1650 yeares, to passe away without
<hi>Prayers, Praises,</hi> and <hi>Thanksgivings</hi> unto him; but
he suffer'd it to passe without any <hi>Altars:</hi> That
of <hi>Noahs</hi> being the<note n="m" place="margin">

               <hi>first</hi> that ever was built, as
learned men are of opinion. Therefore these du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
may be still performed without <hi>Altars.</hi> And
consequently, if after all this search in the <hi>Collects</hi>
of the <hi>Liturgie,</hi> you can finde the <hi>Vicar</hi> nothing,
but <hi>Prayers, Praises, Thanksgivings,</hi> and <hi>Commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations;</hi>
the <hi>holy Table,</hi> in the place where it stood,
will serve for all these, without erecting or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting
this <hi>new Altar.</hi> But what if I finde you
severall <hi>Altars</hi> for all these spirituall <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> in
the ancient Fathers, will you promise not to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb
the <hi>peace</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> any more? Or if this
be too much for you to perform, will you have a

the poore man to procure, if he can, so poore a
<hi>Vicaridge</hi> as your <hi>friends</hi> was, to be quiet in? <hi>Is it
not a very little one?</hi> It is but a piece of a piece of a

               <note n="o" place="margin">Bilson of Christ subject. part 4. p. 524.</note> 1 <hi>Christ and his Apostles did forbear it, and
therefore our Faith may stand without it. 2 The spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches

and consequently unusefull for the edifying of the people.
3 Lastly, we finde by experience, that this very expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion

For I will be bold (not without some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditation)
to make all these severall observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
upon this passage.</p>
            <p>First, that this is the first sonne of the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Church of <hi>England,</hi> that hath presum'd o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly
to expound this place, of a <hi>materiall Altar:</hi>
Yet not <hi>constantly</hi> neither: For he confesseth, for
all his love to this <hi>Text,</hi> that the <hi>Apostle</hi>
               <note n="q" place="margin">Pag. 47.</note> 
               <hi>may
mean</hi> there <hi>the Lords Table,</hi> or <hi>the Sacrifice it self,
which the Lord once offered.</hi> And so a great Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
indeed of this Church hath expounded it.
<hi>For the</hi> Altar <hi>in the old Testament is by</hi> Malachy
<hi>called MENSA DOMINI.</hi>
               <note n="r" place="margin">Bish. Andrew's notes upon Peron, p. 7.</note> 
               <hi>And of the</hi> Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>in the new Testament, by the</hi> Apostle <hi>it is
said, HABEMVS ALTARE.</hi> The <hi>Altar</hi> in
the <hi>old,</hi> the <hi>Table</hi> in the <hi>new Testament</hi> (if we will
speak with that great personage, properly and
Theologically.) And this is the exposition of
<hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> mentioned in the <hi>Letter,</hi> which this
squeamish gentleman could by no meanes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand:
That as sometimes a <hi>Table</hi> is put for an
<hi>Altar,</hi> as in the first of <hi>Malachy;</hi> so sometimes
an <hi>Altar</hi> may be put for a <hi>Table,</hi> as in this <hi>Epistle</hi>
to the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> Then the which solution there
may be peradventure a more full, (for the <hi>Crosse
of Christ</hi> is more appositely aim'd at in that Text,
then the <hi>holy Table</hi>) but there cannot be a more
plain and conceivable Answer. And whereas it
is infer'd, <hi>that then at the least S.</hi> Paul <hi>conceiv'd the
name of an</hi> Altar <hi>neither to be improper, nor imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
in the Christian Church;</hi> there is no man
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:20765:64"/>
ever made doubt thereof; so as it be taken, as S.
<hi>Paul</hi> takes it, <hi>Metaphorically,</hi> and by way of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion,</hi>
but not <hi>materially,</hi> for this <hi>Church-Vtensill;</hi>
which is the thing that lies before us upon the

            <p>For a full Answer to this <hi>Quillet,</hi> I do reade
in Antiquitie, that the form and situation of the

from the<note n="e" place="margin">

               <hi>long Table</hi> of the Shew-bread, which stood in

Fathers</hi> (which you shall by and by finde in
the Margin) the conceits of two <hi>Iewish Rabbins,</hi>
somewhat tending to our purpose. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 4. 22.
it is thus written, <hi>And he said unto me, This is the
Table before the LORD:</hi> Meaning (without doubt)
<hi>the Altar of Incense.</hi> The Question then grows,
why the <hi>Altar</hi> is here call'd a <hi>Table, I have heard
this given as a Reason of it,</hi> saith<note n="o" place="margin">Vitalpand. in Ezek l. 4. c. 51.</note> R. <hi>Shelomo, That
at this day the</hi> Table <hi>performs what the</hi> Altar <hi>was
wont to do.</hi> R. <hi>Iohanan</hi> and R. <hi>Eliezer</hi> give the
like reason, <hi>That while the Temple stood, the</hi> Altar
<hi>of God; but sithence the destruction thereof, the</hi> Table
<hi>of a</hi> man, <hi>is become the place of Sacrifice and propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation.</hi>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:20765:67"/>
But I leave these <hi>Rabbies</hi> to <hi>Rabbi Coal's</hi>

run thus, <hi>Anno 1550. other Letters</hi> (not a <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter)

this impudency of yours, which put us to this
narrow search, we have met with two <hi>particulars</hi>
very pertinent to the present <hi>dispute.</hi> First, that
upon the taking down of the <hi>Altar,</hi> the <hi>Table</hi>
is not directed to be set up in the place <hi>where
the Altar stood,</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">In the Letter of the K. and Counsell to Bishop Ridley, Act. &amp; Mon. part. 2. p. 699.</note> but <hi>in some convenient part of the

meaning of the <hi>Kings proceedings</hi> (better known
to this <hi>Bishop,</hi> then to you) was, <hi>that the</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Ibid. p. 700. col. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Table
should not be placed and disposed Altar-wise,</hi> which
is the Question now before us.</p>
            <p>Soone after, D. <hi>Coal</hi> begins to relent, and could
finde in his heart to bestow half a <hi>Vicaridge</hi> upon
the <hi>Writer</hi> of the Letter, for saying, <hi>That in the

Altar in respect of</hi>
               <note n="e" place="margin">Pag. 33.</note> 
               <hi>what is there offered unto God, and

<hi>participated by men.</hi> See what it is to put a man

               <hi>However it behooveth humble

themselves to the Order of the Church, appointed

which it so well deferves, there is little feare,
that the <hi>people</hi> will <hi>clap them down upon their Breech</hi>

this Church to say, <hi>Amen,</hi> to such divine raptures

those that have the chief care and government in the

if you relie upon his <hi>Character,</hi> the <hi>Letters</hi> placed

have his courteous <hi>Readers</hi> to swallow this
<hi>Gudgeon,</hi> without so much as champing or chew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <hi>Beza</hi> confesseth, that at

to <hi>Geneva,</hi> there was a <hi>Marble-Altar</hi> used for a

(abstracted from all former <hi>relations</hi> to a <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi>)
unto this day. Which I therefore note, to
let you see that <hi>Calvin</hi> was not so strait-lac't in
this <hi>particular.</hi> Yea, but <hi>he findes great fault with
the Commemoration of the dead.</hi> And doth he so?
And I pray you, what doth K. <hi>Iames</hi> declare the

<hi>Commemorations</hi> in the time of the <hi>Communion,</hi>

(another <hi>project,</hi> it seems, the learned Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop

For in the <hi>first Letter</hi> he presents his Grace

the <hi>Impropriations</hi>) I say, it doth not seem they
were much acquainted, by that first <hi>Letter</hi> that
<hi>Calvin</hi> writes unto him. For in that he rails most
bitterly upon yong <hi>Osiander,</hi> a Divine very near

from the <hi>French,</hi> wherein the <hi>Date</hi> was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded)
then came it to the <hi>Dukes</hi> hands (as some
<hi>Letter</hi> from <hi>Calvin</hi> was then delivered to the <hi>Duke</hi>
by one <hi>Nicolas,</hi> a Tel-tale of M. <hi>Calvins,</hi> that stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died

            </p>
            <p>Let us not therefore, as we tender the credit of

as our <hi>Common Prayer-book</hi> is, to be disparaged

               <hi>Curiositie of the

a clear explanation. Of the which <hi>curiosity</hi> and
<hi>mistaking,</hi> whether this removing and placing
of the <hi>Altar,</hi> which they found usually so termed
in the former <hi>Liturgie,</hi> might not be a speciall
branch, I leave to the Readers collection, out of
what hath been already delivered in the examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>Counsell-Act</hi> in that behalf. And
partly also he shall find the <hi>Book</hi> was altered, for
the more<note n="n" place="margin">In the same Act.</note> 
               <hi>perfection</hi> thereof, or (as it followeth

looking every day for the stroke of the <hi>Ax,</hi>
when this Book was passing the severall <hi>Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees</hi>
in the Upper and Lower house of <hi>Parliament.</hi>
And that it <hi>seems</hi> by any one syllable of the <hi>Letter</hi>
to <hi>Farell,</hi> that <hi>Calvin</hi> wrote unto the <hi>King</hi> about
the <hi>change</hi> of the <hi>Liturgie,</hi> is another <hi>blue one.</hi> Reade
the <hi>Letter,</hi> and you will be of my opinion.</p>

               <hi>Yea, but the</hi>
               <note n="o" place="margin">Pag. 40.</note> King <hi>in his Answer to the</hi> Devonshire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<hi>had formerly affirmed, that the</hi> Lords Supper,
<hi>as it was then administred, was brought even to the
very use, as</hi> Christ <hi>left it, as the</hi> Apostles <hi>used it,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:20765:79"/>
and as the holy</hi> Fathers <hi>deliver'd it.</hi> I answer, that
these <hi>Devonshire-men</hi> (whom the <hi>Doctour</hi> cloaths
in this <hi>fair Livery</hi>) were a sort of notorious <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells.</hi>
And if a <hi>King</hi> (to avoid shedding of bloud)
should answer such people clad in steel, <hi>edictis
melioribus,</hi> in a more passable language, then will
endure Logicall examination; is it fit he should
be so many yeares after jeered thus, by such a
<hi>Mushrom</hi> here on <hi>earth,</hi> reigning himself (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all doubt) a most glorious <hi>Saint</hi> above in
<hi>Heaven?</hi> Besides that, <hi>the Form that</hi> Christ <hi>left,
the</hi> Apostles <hi>used, and the</hi> Fathers <hi>deliver'd the</hi>
Lords Supper <hi>in,</hi> is never taken by <hi>judicious Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines</hi>
in a meere <hi>Mathematicall</hi> and <hi>indivisible point</hi>
of exactnesse: but in a <hi>Morall</hi> conformitie, which
will admit of a <hi>Latitude,</hi> and receive from time
to time degrees of<note n="p" place="margin">
                  <hi>And so the King clearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it.</hi> That we may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged from time to time further to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clam. before the Book of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> 1548.</note> 
               <hi>perfection.</hi> But I will not
lead you to any woods, to borrow shadows for
this place: the <hi>Answer</hi> is set down in such capitall
Letters, <hi>that he that runnes by may read it.</hi> The
<hi>Rebells</hi> in their third <hi>Article</hi> (set on by the <hi>Popish</hi>
Priests) do petition for their <hi>Masse</hi> (that is, that
which we call <hi>the Canon of the</hi>
               <note n="q" place="margin">We will have Masse celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as it hath been in times past, without any man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating with the Priest, <hi>Acts and Mon. part. 2. p.</hi> 666.</note> 
               <hi>Masse) and words of
Consecration,</hi> as they had it <hi>before,</hi> and that the
<hi>Priests</hi> might <hi>celebrate it alone, without the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating
of the people.</hi> To this the <hi>King</hi> answers,
<hi>That for the Canon of the Masse and words of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration</hi>
(which is in nothing altered in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<hi>Liturgie) they are such as were used by</hi> Christ,
<hi>the</hi> Apostles, <hi>and the ancient</hi> Fathers: that is,
They are the very <hi>words</hi> of the <hi>Institution.</hi> But
for the second part of their Demand, which was
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:20765:79"/>
for the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of the <hi>Masse,</hi> or <hi>the Priests eating
alone,</hi> they must excuse him: <hi>For this the Popes of</hi>
Rome <hi>for their lucre added unto it.</hi> So there is a
clear <hi>Answer</hi> to both parts of the <hi>Article.</hi> They
should have a <hi>Table,</hi> and a <hi>Communion,</hi> and the
<hi>words</hi> of <hi>Consecration,</hi> as they were used body <hi>Christ,</hi>
the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and the ancient <hi>Fathers:</hi> But they
should have no <hi>Altar,</hi> nor <hi>Sacrifice; for these the
Popes of</hi> Rome <hi>for their lucre, had added to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution;</hi>
being, as<note n="r" place="margin">Def. part. 3. p. 315.</note> B. <hi>Jewell</hi> truly calls them, <hi>the

            </p>
            <p>And this <hi>Answer</hi> did nothing like our noble
<hi>Doctour.</hi> And therefore from making himself
merry with the <hi>King,</hi> by a kinde of <hi>Conversion</hi>
(borrowed from father<note n="s" place="margin">3 <hi>Convers. part. 2. c. 12. p.</hi> 615. But yet for the present, this was the pure Word of God, and the worke of the H. Ghost, and no man might mislike or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it.</note> 
               <hi>Parsons three Conversions</hi>)
he wheels about, and breaks a Lance upon the
<hi>Parliament:</hi> That would take upon them to <hi>mend
a Book,</hi> which they <hi>could not but acknowledge to
be both agreeable to Gods Word and the Primitive
Church.</hi> And then he quotes 5<hi rend="sup">o</hi> and 6<hi rend="sup">o</hi>

to maintain it. I say still, that this <hi>Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ablenesse
to Gods Word and the Primitive Church,</hi> is
not to be taken in a <hi>mathematicall,</hi> but in a <hi>morall</hi>
point. The <hi>first</hi> Book was in <hi>some,</hi> the <hi>second</hi>
is in <hi>more</hi> degrees, <hi>agreeable</hi> to those excellent
<hi>Paterns.</hi> But what need I say this, when the
<hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> saith no such matter as is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended?
In that part of the <hi>Act,</hi> where these
words are mentioned, some <hi>coertion</hi> and <hi>penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
were provided for sensuall persons, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractory
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:20765:80"/>
               <hi>Papists,</hi> who forbore to repair to the
<hi>Parish-Churches</hi> upon the establishment of the
<hi>English Service,</hi> desiring still to feed upon <hi>husks,</hi>
when God had rain'd down his <hi>Manna</hi> upon
them. The <hi>Parliament</hi> (according to their deep
wisdome in that kinde) desirous to include some
reason in the <hi>Preamble,</hi> of the <hi>smart</hi> that comes
after in the <hi>body</hi> of the <hi>Act,</hi> tells the Offenders
against this <hi>new Law,</hi> that <hi>Prayers in the Mother-tongue,</hi>
is no <hi>Invention</hi> of theirs, as the <hi>Priests</hi>
would make them believe, but the <hi>direction</hi> of the
<hi>Word of God,</hi> and the <hi>practice</hi> of the <hi>primitive Church.</hi>
Medling no further with the <hi>Liturgie</hi> in this part
of the <hi>Act,</hi> then as it was a <hi>Service in the Mother-tongue.</hi>
And so begins the <hi>Act, That</hi>
               <note n="t" place="margin">5<hi rend="sup">o</hi> &amp; 6<hi rend="sup">o</hi> Ed. 6. c. 1.</note>

was <hi>Prayer in the Mother-tongue,</hi> and this the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi>
avows to be <hi>agreeable to Gods Word and the
Primitive Church.</hi> And I hope, you are not moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
as yet to that height, as to dare to <hi>deny</hi> it. If
any Reader can doubt of so clear an explication,
let him look once more upon the <hi>Kings Answer</hi>
to the <hi>Devonshire-Rebells,</hi> immediately before
this <hi>Parliament,</hi> and he shall finde <hi>Sun-beams</hi> to

               <hi>Parliament:</hi> both mean
the same <hi>thing,</hi> as they use the same <hi>words: An

that Father <hi>Parsons</hi> and you must <hi>unlaugh</hi> again
this foolish <hi>Laughter,</hi> which you made without

            </p>
            <p>Well, let the <hi>King,</hi> the <hi>Counsell,</hi> and the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi>
order what they please; two things he
will make good: first, that if <hi>Origen,</hi> or <hi>Arnobius</hi>
do<note place="margin">Pag. 45.</note> say <hi>they had no Altars in the Primitive Church,
they meant, not any for bloudy or externall Sacrifices,
as the Gentiles had.</hi> Where you see, he is almost
come to that we have been wrangling for all this
while, That they had <hi>no Altars for externall Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices.</hi>
And shew me, that ever one <hi>Father</hi> or <hi>School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
did teach a necessity of an <hi>externall Altar</hi>
to an <hi>internall Sacrifice,</hi> and I will yeeld him the
better of the <hi>Controversie.</hi> But I see his Loop-hole
already; he will help himself with those words,
<hi>As the Gentiles had:</hi> Although it be, God wot,
but a <hi>poore shift.</hi> And secondly, he will make it
good, that the <hi>Church had Altars, both the Name</hi>
(which the <hi>Letter</hi> denies not, but onely the <hi>name</hi>
applied to the <hi>materiall</hi> Instrument call'd <hi>the
Lords Table) and Thing too, a long time together, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the birth of Origen and Arnobius.</hi> This later part
would prove too heavie a <hi>Buckler</hi> for any man to
take up, that were to fight it out with a <hi>Scholar</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.
For the <hi>Writer</hi> of the <hi>Letter</hi> doth utterly
decline the Combat, retiring himself to his 200
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:20765:81"/>

<hi>Masse</hi> should be said no where, but upon an <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar</hi>)
as to an advantage of ground, and turning B.
<hi>Jewell</hi> against this <hi>Goliah,</hi> without <hi>averring</hi> any
thing of his own, beside the testimony of S. <hi>Paul:</hi> at
which this <hi>Doctour,</hi> like that drunken <hi>Gossip,</hi> saith,
<hi>Amen;</hi> when he should have said, <hi>All this I sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastly
believe.</hi> But having to do but with <hi>this
man of rags,</hi> I dare undertake him in both the
<hi>points;</hi> and if I could fully satisfie that place of
<hi>Tertullian</hi> in his Book <hi>De Oratione,</hi> will adventure
my credit, to wipe his nose of the rest of those
<hi>Testimonies</hi> produced by him. And all this while I
am no <hi>Champion</hi> for the <hi>Writer</hi> of the <hi>Letter</hi> (who
hath withdrawn his Neck out of the Collar) but
of the great <hi>Champion</hi> of our Church, B. <hi>Jewell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the first therefore, because B. <hi>Jewell</hi> saith,
<note n="b" place="margin">Pag. 45.</note> 
               <hi>that then the faithfull, for fear of Tyrants, were
fain to meet together in private houses,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>therefore
it was, they were not so richly furnished, or at least wise
they had not such Altars, as the Gentiles had,</hi> saith
D. <hi>Coal.</hi> But B. <hi>Jewell,</hi> when he spake those words
of their wanting of Churches in the Primitive
Church, addes presently a word or two (which
this <hi>Doctour</hi> did not unwillingly forget)<note n="c" place="margin">Art. 3. p. 145.</note> 
               <hi>And
may we think that Altars were built before Churches?</hi>
Which though it be not altogether an unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
Question (for<note n="d" place="margin">
                  <hi>Because</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Isaac, <hi>and other</hi> Patriarchs <hi>built</hi> Altars <hi>unto the Lord, before the</hi> Tabernacle <hi>or</hi> Temple <hi>were erected, Suar. in 3. tom. 3, 4. 83. disp. 81. Sect. 5. So saith Walasr. Strabo de rebus Ecclesiast. c.</hi> 1.</note> men are of opinion that
<hi>Altars</hi> were built before the <hi>Churches;</hi>) yet is it
sufficient to declare the impudencie of this man,
that would undertake to answer <hi>Origen,</hi> and <hi>Arno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius,</hi>
out of B. <hi>Jewell.</hi> B. <hi>Jewells</hi> conclusion there
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:20765:81"/>
is, that <hi>M. Harding was ill advised to say confidently,
that Altars have ever been sithence the Apostles times.</hi>
And he answers fully out of S.<note place="margin">August. in Q. V. &amp; N. Testam. qu. 101.</note> 
               <hi>Austin,</hi> the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours</hi>
Objection, <hi>that Altars being then portativo,
and carried by the Deacons from place to place</hi> (which
the learned Papists do not deny) they might have
had <hi>Altars,</hi> although they had no standing <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</hi>
That is, <hi>portative Altars,</hi> not of <hi>Stone, fixed</hi>
to the walls of the Church (as our late <hi>Popish Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars</hi>
be) of the which B. <hi>Jewell</hi> might very well
make his former Question.</p>
            <p>Now for that other <hi>Flam,</hi> That <hi>Origen</hi> and
<hi>Arnobius</hi> should deny their having onely of <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenish,</hi>
but not of <hi>Christian Altars;</hi> although it
were enough to stop the mouth of this <hi>Ignoto,</hi> to
set down the Testimonies of those great Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies
of the reformed Church, who (with B. <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell</hi>)
expound these two Fathers, of the <hi>having no

            <p>For <hi>Origen;</hi> it is clear'd in a word, that he

<hi>no Altars at all,</hi> but those <hi>immateriall Altars</hi> we

            <p>And <hi>Arnobius</hi> well weighed, comes to the same
effect. For howbeit he had not to do with <hi>Jewes,</hi>

termes, not, that they erected no <hi>Altar</hi> for their
<hi>Gods</hi> and <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> but that they built them no
<hi>Altar, venerationis ad officia,</hi> to <hi>officiate</hi> upon in any
kinde of <hi>divine worship.</hi> And so <hi>Desiderius Heraldus,</hi>
the best <hi>Critick</hi> extant upon that Book, delivers
himself, That this may be understood<note n="n" place="margin">Potest hoc intelligi sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliciter, quòd nulla haberent simpliciter, <hi>Desid. Herald. ad Ain. l. 6. p.</hi> 342.</note> 
               <hi>simply</hi> and
<hi>absolutely,</hi> without any relation to the <hi>Pagan Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars.</hi>
Holding an opinion elsewhere, that simply
and absolutely there were no <hi>Altars</hi> erected in the
Church of God, before <hi>Tertullians</hi> time. But
this will appeare yet more clearly by a place of
S. <hi>Cyrill,</hi> which the L.<note n="o" place="margin">Institut. l. 6. c. 5. p. 464.</note> B. of <hi>Duresme</hi> doth tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly
examine to this purpose. For <hi>Julian</hi> the
<hi>Apostata</hi> had been a<note n="p" place="margin">Greg. Nazianz. Orat. 3. advers. Julianum.</note> 
               <hi>Reader</hi> of our Church, and
knew the generall practice thereof, and that it
had been in him a ridiculous thing to imagine,
that the <hi>Christians</hi> should have any <hi>Pagan Altars.</hi>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:20765:82"/>
Nay the <hi>wittie Prince</hi> takes notice of it, that the
very <hi>Jewes</hi> do <hi>sacrifice,</hi> and have an agreement in
that particular with the <hi>Pagans,</hi> and yet concludes
bitterly against us (as he conceives) <hi>Offerre Sacra
in Altari &amp; sacrificare cavetis,</hi> You <hi>Christians</hi> are
most scrupulous in offering of any <hi>Sacrifice</hi> upon
your <hi>Altar.</hi> And to this (as the Learned Bishop
well observes) S. <hi>Cyrill</hi> answers not one word:
which had been prevarication before <hi>God</hi> and <hi>man,</hi>
if the <hi>Christians</hi> had acknowledged in those dayes,
any <hi>Christian-Sacrifice</hi> upon a <hi>materiall Altar.</hi>
And in <hi>Minutius Felix,</hi> (if it be well observ'd, and
rightly read) there is as pregnant a testimony as
this of S. <hi>Cyrill.</hi> Some one had<note n="q" place="margin">Et qui homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem summo supplicio pro facinore puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, &amp; Crucis ligna feralia, eorum Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monias fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantur, (<hi>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>For first, the <hi>Order of Morning Prayer</hi> is not (as
this man supposeth) nor ever was, the whole <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

Besides these <hi>Mattius</hi> or <hi>Order of Morning
Prayer,</hi> there were of old,<note n="m" place="margin">See the two Primars.</note> 
               <hi>Lauds, Primes, Houres,

            <p>Besides that, according to this new Recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
we shall have (that which I will be hold to

               <hi>devised

that the <hi>Curate</hi> may hold a privie <hi>Session</hi> in the

this is the true meaning of that <hi>first Rubrick,</hi> that

               <hi>Dominicus de Soto</hi> is of opinion, that
if a sinner do but <hi>privately</hi> demand the <hi>Sacrament</hi>
of the <hi>Parish-priest,</hi> the <hi>Priest</hi> may not deny it
him, untill it be pronounced deniable unto him

               <hi>Suarez</hi> and

the <hi>Parish-priest</hi> to be <hi>restrained</hi> in this case,

onely. But in the case of a <hi>publick demand</hi> the
<note n="l" place="margin">In 3<hi rend="sup">m</hi>, disp. 67. § 4.</note> 
               <hi>Iesuite</hi> sets down, in my opinion, an excellent
Rule. It is requisite for the <hi>Common good,</hi> and the
convenient order of both <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Common-wealth,</hi>
that all <hi>common favours,</hi> which are <hi>publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
to be disposed and distributed according to
the <hi>merit</hi> &amp; <hi>dignity</hi> of <hi>private persons,</hi> should be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensed
by some <hi>publick Minister,</hi> designed thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
by the chief person in that <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Common-wealth;</hi>
not according to the <hi>private knowledge</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of that <hi>Minister,</hi> but according to a <hi>publick</hi>
and <hi>notorious cognisance,</hi> agreed upon in that
<hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Common-wealth.</hi> And however a sinner
doth by his offence against God, loose (as the
<hi>School-men</hi> think) his <hi>right</hi> and <hi>interest</hi> in this bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<hi>Sacrament,</hi> untill by a new <hi>Repentance,</hi> he
makes, as it were, a <hi>new Purchase</hi> of the same; yet,
saith<note n="m" place="margin">In 4<hi rend="sup">m</hi>, d. 12. q. 1. art. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Aquinas, must he loose it in the face of the
Church, before it can be denied him in the face of the
Church:</hi> Being to be <hi>judged</hi> (as in all other <hi>Cases</hi>)
not by any <hi>man,</hi> nor any <hi>Ministers private knowledge,</hi>
but according to <hi>Proofs</hi> and <hi>Allegations,</hi> before
such <hi>men</hi> and in such <hi>places</hi> onely, as have power
to admit of <hi>Proofs</hi> and <hi>Allegations.</hi> The <hi>Common
good</hi> requiring necessarily, that all such <hi>publick
actions</hi> of this nature should be reigled by a kind
of <hi>publick,</hi> and not <hi>private knowledge;</hi> which once
admitted into <hi>Iudicature,</hi> would soon fill up the
<hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State</hi> with a world of <hi>Scandals, Injuries</hi>
and <hi>Inconveniences.</hi> And although <hi>publick de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders</hi>
of this <hi>Sacrament</hi> are by the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of
these <hi>Iesuites</hi> to be <hi>publickly</hi> rejected, when their
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:20765:94"/>
offences are known to the <hi>Priest,</hi> either by an
<hi>Evidence of Law,</hi> or by an <hi>Evidence of fact;</hi> yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
this later <hi>Evidence of fact</hi> doth arise from a
scrupulous and curious examination of the <hi>num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
of the <hi>persons</hi> which know the same (and how
many of the present <hi>Communicants</hi> be of that <hi>num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>)
as also of the <hi>quality</hi> of the <hi>place,</hi> the <hi>nature</hi> of
the <hi>Crime,</hi> the <hi>Condition</hi> of the <hi>Witnesses,</hi> and a
thousand other <hi>Circumstances;</hi> I had leiver entrust
the <hi>Ordinary</hi> for altogether, then trouble a
simple <hi>Curate</hi> to charge his head-piece with so
many Quillets, and be liable afterwards to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
over in higher <hi>Courts,</hi> for the least <hi>misprision,</hi>
and <hi>misapprehension</hi> in any of these curious pieces
or Circumstances.</p>
            <p>My practice therefore hath ever been, not to
<hi>keep back,</hi> but to <hi>admonish</hi> onely, <hi>publick offenders,</hi>
upon the like <hi>evidence of fact;</hi> and that not <hi>publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
neither, nor by <hi>Name.</hi> And I continue the
stiffer in this Opinion, because I find sithence
the <hi>Reformation,</hi> our Church had once a <hi>Canon</hi>
for the <hi>One</hi> (which still may be in some force)
but never any footstep of the <hi>other,</hi> being the
height of the <hi>Genevan</hi> and <hi>Presbyterie Doctrine.</hi> But
for the former, there was (as I said) a <hi>Rubrick</hi> of
this nature, immediately before the <hi>Collect, You

               <hi>Here the

commune with him privily at convenient leisure. Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily,</hi>
not <hi>in the Church: At leisure,</hi> not <hi>by chopping

               <hi>he so fain

<hi>on the other: The</hi> Laws <hi>and</hi> Canons <hi>now in force
looking alike in all. And if there be not some cunning,
to make</hi> Chappells <hi>and</hi> Cathedralls <hi>guilty of some
foule Transgression.</hi> The Reason that the poore

The <hi>Reason</hi> that you give is void of all
<hi>reason</hi> (though not of all <hi>malice</hi>) that he should do

he doth both <hi>approve</hi> in the <hi>Vicar,</hi> and <hi>imitate in his

the point in hand, <hi>That whereas in</hi> Parish-churches,
<hi>the ten Commandments were onely appointed
to be printed in little Tables, and to be fixed upon the
wall over the said Communion-Boord; there is a speciall
Proviso, that in</hi> Cathedrall Churches, <hi>the Tables of
the said Precepts be more costly and largely painted out.</hi>
Whereof this may be a reason, That in some <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrall

in <hi>tertio</hi> of the <hi>Queen,</hi> and consequently

might stand, as the <hi>Altar</hi> did before, <hi>all along,</hi> and
the Commandments be more <hi>largely painted out,</hi>
to fill up the length and extension of the same.
But he that will peruse all these <hi>Canons</hi> well, that
concern the placing and displacing of <hi>Tables,</hi>
shall finde, that not one of them names <hi>Cathedrall
Churches;</hi> And will easily condemne this mans
supposition, as childish and ridiculous, That

made good, let the <hi>Writer</hi> defend himself for
me; I wash my hands of him. Yes, there is
nothing can be more clearly prov'd. For in
the Letter to Bishop <hi>Ridley</hi> it is said, that <hi>it
was come to the Kings knowledge already</hi> (that is,
before any <hi>Order</hi> given by the <hi>King</hi> or the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell,</hi>
for ought appeares in any <hi>Book</hi> or upon

were taken down.</hi> Were they taken
down <hi>already,</hi> before the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Counsell</hi> heard
thereof? and upon <hi>Considerations</hi> onely? Then
surely, not upon any <hi>Command</hi> of the <hi>King, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi>

of the <hi>People,</hi> instructed by their <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,</hi>
that <hi>the form of a Table would more move
the simple to the right use of the Lords Supper.</hi> For
so the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Lords,</hi> in their first <hi>reason,</hi> do

Nay, this <hi>Iudicious Divine</hi> implies very strongly,
that the <hi>name</hi> and <hi>fashion</hi> of an <hi>Altar</hi> is more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to the <hi>Pietie of the times,</hi> and the <hi>Good

to prove the <hi>lawfulnesse of bowing before the Altar.</hi>
The <hi>Altar,</hi> I say, not the <hi>Table,</hi> by any means.
For in this short <hi>Discourse</hi> (which held me but

thus, untill within these threescore yeares.
And yet in this severe <hi>Reformation,</hi> which that
<hi>Cardinall</hi> made in all the Churches of the State
of <hi>Millain,</hi> he doth<note n="g" place="margin">Actor. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. Mediolan. part. 4. l. 1. de fabr. Eccles. p. 567.</note> require, that there be

<pb n="224" facs="tcp:20765:116"/>
every Sabbath-day perform the</hi> Agends <hi>of this</hi> Austin
<hi>and S.</hi> Gregory. And shall we believe, that no
<hi>Church</hi> of all the <hi>English</hi> Nation, did imitate here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
her first <hi>Metropolis?</hi> It is impossible it should
be so. But we may the more reasonably presume,
the <hi>Conjecture</hi> (for I dare not otherwise pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
it) of D.<note n="r" place="margin">An Answer of a true Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an to a counterf. Catholick, Artic. 14.</note> 
               <hi>Fulk</hi> to be worthy of further
consideration. That <hi>if you mark the most part of the
old Churches in</hi> England, <hi>you shall plainly see, that
the Chancells are but additions builded since the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es.</hi>
Also that some Churches are builded <hi>round,</hi>
as one in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and the <hi>Temple</hi> in <hi>London;</hi>
to which may be added the old <hi>Pantheon</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi>
call'd by the Moderns, <hi>Santa Maria Rotunda.</hi>
And many Churches (if you mark it) which are
of the <hi>Gothick</hi> building, have their steeples at the
<hi>East-end.</hi> Lastly, a number of our old Churches
have their <hi>Iles</hi> of such a perfect <hi>Crosse,</hi> that they
cannot possibly see either <hi>high Altar,</hi> or so much
as the <hi>Chancell.</hi> A shrewd Argument that the
<hi>holy Tables</hi> in <hi>England</hi> were not <hi>fixed</hi> as the <hi>Piety
of the Times</hi> would now have them, when these
<hi>Churches</hi> were first erected. I will conclude all

the different Customes in the Christian Church, saith of

<hi>that it was built in different manner from all other

makes (or would fain make) these two <hi>Historians</hi>
to say, that the generall practice of the Church
(besides a few places in <hi>Antioch</hi>) was to make
their <hi>Altars</hi>

Howbeit properly the <hi>Altars</hi> cannot be said to
