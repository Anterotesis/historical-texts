         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For as betvvene the Flynt and Yron, being striken together, fyre doth Flye out, so Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gementes and VVittes contending, the Light off right knovvleadge must nedes appeare. Suche Lighte ones appearing, the Truthe is soone had. You M. Ievvel, to haue this Truthe tryed, haue proposed your Questions, and haue Challenged all that vvill, to ioyne issue vvith you in a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Articles. To that your Challenge it hathe bene Ansvvered Copiously and Lernedly. And
<pb facs="tcp:5494:5"/>
the Truthe hathe bene proued, not only in the Termes of your Challenge vvhich is lesse mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, but much more in the Matter, comprised in those Termes. To that Ansvver you haue Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied largely also and painefully.</p>
            <p>In this your Replie as you haue spared no Rhetorike, multiplyed Allegatyons, hunted af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Common places, entred in to Digressyons, al to make a Shevve of lerning, and a Countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of a Iuste and Full Replie to the Matter it sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe: so haue you for the Disgracing of your Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, and for Discredityng the Author him selfe, vsed much Arte and taken great Paynes. Novve vvith Scoffes and Tauntes, Novve dissembling a great vvhile his Meaning, and reasoning sadly against that no man saied, coming in after vvith your, <hi>But M.

At other times not Replying to him at all, but Opposing off your ovvne store. But one Caste you haue inuented, vvhich I remembre not that any other vvriter e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer Vsed before. A Caste I saie sufficient alone, if it vvere clenly conuayed, and vprightlye practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, not only to discredit the Author and to Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founde the Aduersary, but also to ouerthrovve his Doctrine, and to satisfie the Matter. VVhat is

            <p>In these <hi>Vntruthes,</hi> you note to the Reader, not only the presumed faultes, errours or escapes of the Author, in penning and treating his Matter, but much more you note euery Principall poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te of Doctrine, euery Proued Proposition, and Matter treated, that semed to you and your hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, Vntrue. In this Inuentyon you take great pleasure. Of it you make great Vau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes. By it you thinke to vvinne the Credit and Persuasion of al men. For, this point you note to your Reader of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes not only in the text of your Replie, but in your Preface, in your Conclusyon, and in the Table of your booke. In your Text, tovvard the ende of your first Article, hauing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> charged D. Harding vvith .44. Vntruthes, you Crie out, and saie. <hi>O M. Harding,</hi>

               <hi>is it not possible your doctrine maye stande without lies? So many Vntruthes, in so litle roome, without the shame of the worlde, without feare of God?</hi> In an other place you put the Reader in minde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine of this matter, and you saie of <hi>D.</hi> Harding. <hi>This man coulde neuer vtter so many Vntruthes together without some speciall priuilege.</hi>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lbeit in the Epistle prefixed to M. Iewell, I haue (Christen Reader) saied so much, as maye in greate parte suffise to instruct and prepare thy Attention to the reading and vnderstanding of this Returne of Vntru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes &amp;c: yet, to thentent that before thou enter to perusing thereof, thou maye all thinges thouroughly be instructed, I haue thought good shortly to laye before thee, the Cause of this our Enterprise: the Order and maner of our present writing: the Matter principally contayned therein: and the profit that hereof maye be looked for.</p>
            <p>Touching the first it is not vnknowen to all those that any thinge haue trauayled in perusing such bookes, as of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te haue come forthe touching matters in religion controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sious, neither what Challenge was published at Paules Crosse of late yeres, neither what Answer hath bene made thereunto, nor last of all what Replie hath come forthe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst that Answer. The Replie is knowen to be greate, estemed to be lerned, and thought to be such a piece, as the party impugned shall neuer be able to answer. VVhat an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer the party can make, it shall in the Reioynder appeare. But for one man to answer the whole, and that stitche by stitche (as the Replier requireth) bothe the time woulde be so longe, that many a soule in the meane might perish, abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb facs="tcp:5494:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by that lewde piece of worke, and also the booke woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de be so greate that fewe woulde bye it, fewer peruse it, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It hath bene thought good therefore of those that in Truthes cause loue to take payne, that for better expedition, many sett vpon it, though eche one did but a litle. The Answerer hath not bene ydle, as by his Reioynder it wil wel appeare. Yet other mens pennes he coulde not staye, euery one to folowe, as Zele pricked forwarde,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>M. Rastel.</hi>
               </note> I haue thought good to Iustifie the Vntruthes, which it hath liked the Replyer to charge vpon his Aduersary all alonge his Replie. To this I was moued by diuerse reasons.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se of the setting forthe of this Retur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne &amp;c.</hi>
               </note> I euer thought (as in the processe afterwarde I sawe it fell out) that the weakest par<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes through out the Replie, should be those, where such Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truthes were noted. For I thought not, nor any man els I tro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>we wil thinke, either that the Replyer hath so litle witt as not to espie, which partes were most lykely to be Vntrue, and there to score vp his Vntruthe (the proper Badge in dede of this Replyers Cognysance) either that he owed any such good wil to his aduersary (who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by that Inuentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he minded for euer to deface and discredit) as that he would dissemble and winke at great faultes, and note only certayne small es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capes. These weaker partes therefore being proued stronge and good, I thought the residewe of the whole Answer shoulde nede at al no defence: but might stande for true, as
<pb facs="tcp:5494:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
being passed ouer by the Replyer without any note of Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truthe. For as in a broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nette, the holes being sowed vp, the whole net is good and wil serue wel againe: so it semed me, these presumed Vntruthes being redressed or discharged, the whole Answer might goe for good, godly, and true. By this meanes therefore going through the Replie, a compendyous waie was founde, shortly and yet sufficiently bothe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende the former Answer, and to satisfie this Replie. And this lo was one and the first Cause that moued me to (deuise this Returne. An other Cause (which perusing a longe the Vntruthes as they stode in the Margin of the Diuisions I es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied) was this. The Replyer in all these foure Articles, the former halfe of his Replie, hath noted for Vntruthes, bothe the principall Matters treated and proued in the Articles, and also the Conclusions thereof, as not yet proued. I sawe therefore that in Iustifying these Vntruthes it was necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to enter the Replie: to labour the principall Matters: and to proue, that all thinges were wel proued. This is in effect to answer the whole. For, other small matters nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther so waighty, as the Replyer woulde cauille at them, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther so weake as he coulde finde any Coulour of Vntruthe to sett vpon them, might well for breuities sake, in a full and perfect Reioyndre be omitted. This therfore I haue done, and by this the Replyer maye thinke him selfe suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently answered, in this former halfe of his Replie.</p>
            <p>Howe, in what Order and maner, and howe farre I ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ue this done, it shall nowe appeare. I do first laye forthe the

Then foloweth i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mediatly the Vntruthe and the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof noted by the Replyer, worde for worde, as it standeth in the Margin of his Replie vpon the text of D.H. After in an other distinct letter, foloweth the Iustifying and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging of the Vntruthe, whereby the Replyer is Rechar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, the Vntruthe vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him Returned, and he proued a Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underer. VVhen occasion serueth, as when some principall Matter contayning doctrine and concerning the state of the Questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> occurreth, whereby the Reader maye be edifyed, the whole text of the Replie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning that matter is inser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and to euery parcel thereof Answer is made. In the first Article I haue done this only in two places, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tayning the ve<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry substaunce of the Article, as I shal anon declare. All the other Vntruthes I Iustifie shortly without entring to the text of the Replyer. Thus I haue there done bicause D.H. hath him selfe made a full and perfit Reioyndre to this first Article. In the Seconde Article, as the Vntruthes there no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, require very seldom such labour, but may shortly be Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified, so haue I not often entred the text of the Replie, but only aboute the Principall matters of the Article, whereof I shall speake anon. In the thirde and Fourthe Articles, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the Fourthe, I haue not lefte any whit of M.

For a daily externall Sacrifice on the priestes parte being necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and yet the people not bounde by any lawe or precept dai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly to communicat, it remayneth most necessary, that in Case none will Receiue, the priest maye and ought to Receiue alone, seing without Receiuing the Sacrifice maye not be celebrated. And thus priuat Masse, which is the sole Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the priest, is founde not only lawfull, but necessary.

Last of all that such Appeales doe necessarely importe a Soueraine Authorite of the Pope ouer the whole Churche. Item that no Appeales can be remoued from the Pope or made to the Emperour in causes ecclesiasticall, as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyer laboureth in vaine to proue.

And thus much of the principall matters especially treated and deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the processe of these foure Articles.</p>
            <p>VVhat profit of all these Matters thus debated, maye of thee be looked for (gentle Reader) thou mayest soone con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieue considering only this one Case. D. Harding in his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, treating first most of these Matters, bothe hath vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red such good lerning as he founde in other Catholike wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, treating before of the same in latin: and also by his ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and priuat study beside hath added much thereunto, M.

Iewell hath in his Replie partly vttered such escapes to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide the Authorites alleaged, as commonly of the Latin writers of his secte are vsed, partly and that most common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hath aleaged beside against the Truthe all tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, Allegations, reasons and Authorytes for the Contrary parte: As if he did not Replie against an other, but treate him selfe freely and freshly of the matter. By this meanes in these two bookes (the Answer of D. Harding, and the Replie of M. Iewell) bothe partes haue saied their minde, the one for the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like faithe: the other not only against the Catholike faythe, but also for his owne secte and opinion. I haue bene therefo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re driuen in persecuting the text of the Replies, not only to defende the Catholike, but also to answer the heretike: not only to vpholde our owne grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des and to repayre them with newe defences, against the Replyers newe assaultes, but much more to ouerthrowe the Aduersaryes groundes and foundations which he opposeth and setteth vp afresh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Truthe. I haue done therefore herein a thirde and newe labour in most pointes not before done of any. By perusing whereeof, thou shalt (gentle Reader) be instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, not only howe to maintaine the Catholike doctrine, but also howe to ouerthrowe the heresy: not only to see the groundes of the Catholike faithe established, fortified and confirmed, but also to beholde the fickle foundations of the
<pb facs="tcp:5494:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Lutheran and Caluinian Religion (touching the pointes here treated) battered, shaken, and ouerthrowen. Brefely thou shalt see in the person of M. Iewell and of his maner of reasoning, that the foundation of his and his felowes Re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ligio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, especially against their dewe Obedience to the See A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolike, standeth vpon Ignorance of the stories, falsifying of the doctours, of councelles, of the lawes,<note place="margin">

For hereof loe, Arise the hundreds of Vntruthes committed by this Replyer in the treating only of these principall matters aboue specified and in fighting only against the weakest and vntruest par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of his aduersaryes Answer. If our purpose had bene, to haue gone alonge his whole Replie and to haue persecuted his text vpon other partes of the Answer, not so noted with Vntruthes, and therefore of all lykelyhood the more True partes, the Stronger, and the lesse able truly to be reproued, this Replyer then should tel by the Thousandes, and might go for a Pinner for his Numbers of Vntruthes. But of his Dealing in the Epistle prefixed to him, it hath bene saied sufficiently. To returne to our matter I saie.</p>
            <p>If the Argument of these other three first Articles do lesse delight, as being in dede of lesse importaunce, yet Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider I beseche thee (gentle Reader, if thou shortly desire to be informed which waye to take) and diligently peruse the Fourthe Article of this booke. Namely in such places whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re M. Iewelles Replie against Appeales made to the Pope, against the Confirmation of Generall Councelles, and of

For in those places it shall appeare, bothe with what shiftes, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities, Inconueniences, and open Vntruthes the allegatyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of D. Harding are impugned, and much more with what extreme lying, lewde and Vntrue dealing, the contrary par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te is by M. Iewell vpholded and defended. Being in this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle persuaded, euery wise and discrete Reader, shall incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently in al other matters nowe denied by heretikes, retire to the vnite and belefe of the Catholike Church.

<pb facs="tcp:5494:31"/>
For none but Priestes can do that which Christ did, none <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> but Priestes can minister the holy Sacrament as Christ then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> did. Againe a number receiueth daily thourough out the who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le Church of Christ, a number eateth, breaketh, and dothe that which Christ did. And so the commaundement of a number <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> is fulfilled. Last of al this is in dede the example of Christ, that in his blessed Supper, a number did communicat. But this is no commaundement of Christ that for euer a number should in like maner co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municat together. He saied: <hi>Hoc facite,</hi> doe ye this, bicause they were then made priestes that should so do, he saied not <hi>Sic facite,</hi> do ye after this sorte as ye see I haue done.

Shortly after this time the Britains being forsaken of the Romains, oppressed with the Peightes and Scottes their euill neighbours, and last of all so ouerronne with the Saxons and English people, sent for in to ayde them, that with in lesse then ij. hundred yeares, all that is now called England, was brought vnder the dominion of the Saxons, and English people (the olde Brittons beinge driue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the straightes, which they yet ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe) being all heathen and infidels, then to our countre of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland and to vs Englishmen liuing in paganisme and idolatry, that holy and blessed bishop of Rome S.

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:5494:43"/>
that being once done, it standeth good for all daies and for euer.</p>
            <p>For these are his owne very wordes. It shall be now proued against him out of the fathers that not withsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding the wordes of S.

Nowe the two commaunded to be present in Soters decree, to answer to the Priest, it was indifferent whether they were off the laie or of the clergy.

then?<note place="margin">How the Sacrifice and the preaching is called daily.</note> The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, saye you, it is an Vntruthe, to saie it was daily. No Vntru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the at al M. Iewell. For when the saying of an Author is true in that sence which he meaned, then is the saying true. Nor daily preaching, nor daily Sacrifice is so auouched, that precisely eue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry daie in the whole yeare, either sermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s were made, either the Sacrifice offred. That is called daily in the olde writers whiche was often done and ones at the lest euery weke. So was the preaching, so was the sacrifice. You heard S. Austen before call the Blessed Sacrament, our daily bread. And thereuppon you conclude your selfe,<note place="margin">pag. 63. lin. 11.</note> The people then receiued the Sacrament euery daye. And yet in the next page before disputinge againste the daily Sacrifice,<note place="margin">M. Iewell contrarye to him selfe.</note> you saye. Neyther was the Communion then Ministred euerye daye. For proufe whereoff yow alleage an epistle sent from certaine bishoppes, wherein it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed that the ministration was only vpon the Sondaies.<note place="margin">pag. 62. lin. 3.</note> Now then M. Iewell if the people receiued the Sacrament euery da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ie, and yet the Communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was only ministred vpon the Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daies, either you must graunt that they receiued without a Communiom which is by your doctrine a great abuse, either that a thinge may be called daily though it be done but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in the weke. And then if you may so interpret the dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sacrifice, why may not we interpret the daily preaching in like maner, bicause it was done ones in the weke, as the place which you alleage out of Chrysostom against D. Harding, wit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nesseth expressely?<note place="margin">pag. 63. lin. 35.</note> Thus it was no Vntruthe for D. Harding to call that daily preaching which was but ones in the weke, no more then it is for you to saye The people receiued euery daye,<note place="margin">The 70. Vntruthe For befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re he sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ied: <hi>The people re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry daie.</hi>
               </note> and yet The communion was ministred only vpon the Sonday.</p>
            <p>Againe to shifte away the daily sacrifice, you saie the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament may be called daily bread not for that it is daily receiued, but for that there is no day excepted, but it may be receiued euery day. By this meanes also we may saie, The preaching in Antioche was called daily of D. Harding: bicause there was no day ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:5494:54"/>
but that there might be a Sermon made euery day. Thus M. Iewel by your owne phrases and expositions,<note place="margin">M. Iewell confuteth him selfe.</note> the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of D. Harding is proued to be no Vntruthe.

            <p>This Gheasse as it is vtterly vntrue, so it is vtterly vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. I will tell you Chrisostoms purpose, and proue it to by his owne wordes.

Thus farre Nestorius persuading his hearers that we receaued the bare Fleshe of Christe in the Sacrament without the diuinite or Godhead adioyned. Again<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ste the which damnahle Heresye, Cyrillus disputing in the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me place saieth. <hi>Num hominis comestionem nostrum hoc Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum pronuncias, &amp; ad crassas cogitationes vrges eorum qui cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diderunt mentes</hi>?

Sacrament, but the bare flesh to be by it selfe, and the Bloud in like maner by it selfe, it is easy to iudge that he was of this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that vnder the forme of Bread in the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, was the Bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dy of Christ without Bloud, which is the thinge that D.

            <p>This deprauation M. Iewell laieth to D. Hardinges charge for putting the worde <hi>(only)</hi> in the last place.

As in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, the tenth, the eight and the seuententh chapters it may be sene. And so it is no Vntruthe, that by the letter of holy Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re, the Apostles baptised only in the name of Iesus Christ. The displacing of a worde which altereth not the sence (vnlesse M. Iewel ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> proue it was done of fraude or malice) is no Vntruthe in any vpright iudgement. The sence of holy scripture being kept, the Scripture is not depraued, though some worde be put out of order. Now that the Scripture so saieth, bothe the only mentioning of such forme of baptim, in all the Actes of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, bothe the letter it selfe I saie, and the meaning also of the letter, if we beleue the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of S.

When it is saied, In the name of our lorde Iesus Christ, by the vnite of the name, the sacrament is complete. For (as S.

Bicause we haue begonne to speake of holy thinges, it is not to be left vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>spoken, that sanctification is one thinge, and that which is sanctified an other. For Sanctification is that which sanctifieth an other. But that which is sanctified, can not sanctifie an other, though it selfe be holy. As
<pb facs="tcp:5494:76"/>
for example:</hi>
               <note place="margin">The sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne of the Crosse.</note> 
               <hi>Thou makest the signe of the Crosse ouer thy bread, right so as S. Paule saieth. For it is made holy by the worde of God and pra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ier.

               <hi>but also Sanctification. For as much as not only that is geuen, which is sene, but also which is vnderstanded. And so it is laufull to cast of the sanctified bread to beastes, and to infidels, bicause it doth not sanctifie the receiuer. But if that which is tak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now that which is geuen with the hande, is not to be geuen to beastes, nor to infidels, for that is not only Sanctified, but also Sanctification and sanctifieth the receiuer.</hi> Thus farre Chrysostom. In which wordes he doth bothe expounde the place of the 24. of S. Luke (whereof I spake a litle before) for the Sacrament, and also saieth expressely touching this place which we now talke of, the 27. of the Actes, that S. Paule in the ship gaue the bread with his han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de to Luke, and to the rest of his disciples (not to infidels M.

            <p>At the first planting of the faith amonge vs englishmen S. Gregory sent churche bookes to England from Rome for the Church Seruice of the new conuerted Englishmen.</p>
            <p>But those Church bookes sent from Rome were in the latin tongue.</p>
            <p>Ergo the Churche Seruice of the new conuerted English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men was in the latin tounge.</p>

               </note>For proufe of the Maior, or first proposition, I bringe the testimony of Venerable Bede, a lerned countreman of oures, writen in the yere of our lorde, 730. His wordes be these. <hi>Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der more the saied Pope,</hi> (he meaneth S. Gregory) <hi>for so much as Augustine had aduertised him that there was a great haruest, and fewe workemen, sent him with his saied legates, more preachers: of the which the chefest were Mellitus, Iustus, and Ruffinianus. By them also he sent al such thinges as were necessary for the furniture and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery of the Church: As holy vessels, aultar clothes, ornaments for the Churches, apparell also for the priestes and clergy. Also relikes of the holy Apostles and martyrs, and many Bookes.</hi> Thus farre Bede. In who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se wordes we see for the Furniture and Ministery of the church Bookes to haue ben sent from Rome: That this was done at the first planting of Christen faith amonge vs Englishmen (vs En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glishmen I saie, occupying at that time all that is now called England, the olde Brittons being driuen in to the straights of Wales) let the whole History of Venerable Bede be a witnesse to all englishmen, though M. Iewell in this Article afterwarde, most impiously, and impudently after his maner do denie it.</p>
            <p>Now touching the Minor, or second proposition that these Churche bookes sent from Rome were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n the latin tounge,<note place="margin">The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor.</note> it nedeth not I trust to proue. It is euident that our english Saxon tounge was not at that time vnderstanded at Rome, neither of

those which came fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Rome, at their first arriual in to our cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tre, but the Latin tounge only. And therfore those bookes sent from Rome for the Furniture and Seruice of the Church were in Latin and not in English. Thus the premisses being clere, the Conclusion is vndoubted. Other argumentes are brought afterwarde in this Article by D. Harding, to the which how well M. Iewell hath replied, it will appeare in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation thereof. Vpon this conclusion, that the Church serui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice was in the Latin tounge, it shal not nede I trowe to infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re. Ergo it was in a strau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge and vnknowen tounge to English men. I trust M. Iewell will not be so impudent as to saie that all Englishmen then conuerted to the faithe vnderstode the Latin tounge. Which if he will saie, as truly with no lesse im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudency he denieth the faith to haue ben then first planted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge vs englishmen and most wickedly violateth the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed memory of our Apostle S.

Other prouinces lying betwene these, do reade the bookes of Palestina, which Eusebius and Pamphilus, being first corrected by Origen, did sett foorth, and all the worlde in this triple variete of copies contendeth one with the other.</p>
            <p>By these wordes of S. Hierom it is euident, that in all the East parte of the worlde (which he calleth here the whole worlde) from Aegypt to Constantinople, and within all the countres lying betwene, comprehending al Asia the les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se, these three copies only of the Greke Bibles were vsed. For in this triple diuersite, he saieth all that parte of the world con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth. Of those midle prouinces lying betwene Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople and Antioche, are those countres aboue named of the lesser Asia, except Thracia which is of the proper Iurisdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Constantinople and no parte of the lesser Asia. As the skill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in Cosmographie do knowe right well. Now out of this place of S. Hierom for proofe of the Maior or first propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:5494:81"/>
thus I reason.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The common seruice of those countres was for the most parte taken out of their Bibles and holy Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But by S. Hieroms testimony their Bibles were only in the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke tounge of the</hi> 70. <hi>translation, sett forth either by Hysichius, or Lu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cianus the Martyr or Eusebius and Pamphilus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ergo <hi>their common seruice was only in the Greke tounge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The maior of this Syllogismus, is euident bothe for that the Psalmes and the lessons are knowen to be the greater parte of the Seruice, and also by diuerse canons of that age and time,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Concil. Carthag.</hi> 3. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> 40.</note> commaunding Scripture to be read in the Church seruice. The minor is S. Hieroms. So the Conclusion is certaine. Againe, S. Basill celebrated the Seruice in Cappadocia in the Greke tounge as it appeareth by his Liturgie yet extant in gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke: Chrisostom also in Thracia, as it appeareth by his Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie or Masse yet extant also in Greke. Ergo the Publike Seruice in Cappadocia and Thracia were in the Greke tounge.</p>

            <p>Soothely (good Reader) if it had liked M. Iewel to haue ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the leaue to reade forthe the whole sentence of S. Hierom, thou shouldest haue sene this singing of psalmes was no parte of the Church seruice, but an extraordinary deuotion of that people toward that good woman deceased. For thus it folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth immediatly after the wordes by M. Iewell alleaged. Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes were songe <hi>not only for three daies space, vntil the time she was buried vnder the Church nygh to the vawte of our lorde, but also through out the whole weke: al that came, thinking it their owne fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall and their owne sorowe.</hi> Now vnlesse M. Iewell will saie
<pb facs="tcp:5494:84"/>
that al the weke longe they were a saying her diriges, or that in a sett seruice of one Churche there should be a confusion of so many tounges, or that the Seruice was in all those foure to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unges at once, this can nothing helpe him.

            </p>
            <p>The truthe is. In all places and countres, the priest must so distinctly pronounce the Seruice, that when the people of duty must answer, he may be vnderstanded, what he say. So children and Parisheclarkes are taught to answer the Priest, knowing well the wordes what he saieth, though not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing what the wordes meane. And as now for the whole people one or a fewe doth answer, being taught and instructed thereto, so in the primitiue Church all the people for the most part was so instructed and did so answer.

At what time the Seruice was only in Greke and Latin (as it shall in the next Vntruthe appeare) and yet sundry Nations vnderstode not at that time the very Greke and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin. This therefore is a very weake and false proceding of M. Iewell, in auouching that thinge, the contrary whereof is by
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:5494:97"/>
such an vniuersall practise of Christes Churche proued and iustified. For euery good Resolution M. Iewell, proceding from the causes to the effectes, (as this your Resolution would seme to doe) ought to procede <hi>A Causis per se &amp; proximis.</hi> from proper causes, and those the nearest, not of bastarde surmised causes and those farre sought. As you do heare M. Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well. For when you inferre, <hi>The people must answer, Amen, Ergo they must vnderstande the praier,</hi> making the vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the people, to folowe necessarely of the answering Amen, you make a Fallax, of <hi>Non causa pro causa.</hi> For as I sayd, the people may and haue these many hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred yeres answered <hi>Amen</hi> to the priest, though they vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de not the priest. But the cause why the people must answer Amen, is as S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin and S. Cyprian hath tolde you M. Iewell, partly to geue their consent to Gods Minister, partly thereby to lifte vp their hartes to God, and to praie with him. Thus therefore, as one linke of a chayne being broken, all that foloweth, falleth of, and will hange no more together, so your resolution fayling here in the middest, that which you drawe after, must nedes dragge behinde, and come shorte of the whole purpose.

               <hi>Amen, to God at thy thankes geuing? For he knoweth not what thou saiest. Thou geuest thankes well. But the other is not edified. For these causes therefore it behoueth, that the praier at the holy Oblation, and also other praiers be offred with lowde voice of the holy bishoppes and priestes vnto our Lorde Iesus Christ with the Father and the holy Ghoste.</hi> Thus farre the Constitution of Iustinian. His wordes do require (as S. Augustins also before) that the Priest do speake alowde at the holy Oblation time. And the cause thereoff he geueth. Not that the people may vnderstande him. For in Iustinians time, fewe or none of the common vulgar people vnderstode the lerned Greke or Latin wherein the
<pb facs="tcp:5494:99"/>

But that the people hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the priest, <hi>might thereof be stirred to more deuotion, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour geuing to God.</hi> To the which deuotion the people is stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, when the priest lifteth vp his voice, stretcheth his han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, and knocketh his breast, with other such godly tokens of the inwarde man, though they vnderstande not the very wordes that the priest speaketh: Yea and better also then if they vnderstode them, as the very experience of deuotion in olde time,<note place="margin">Vulgar Seruice Distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> and at these dayes dothe euidently declare. For no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we the people (as I haue heard them my selfe complaine) harkening to the Minister reading the Scriptures in English, and vnderstanding the meaning thereof as much as if they were readd in greke, they spende the litle time which they abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de in the Churche rather in wondering at suche straunge mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, then in priuat deuotion and praier. Yea by that externall noyse of the English Seruice familiar to their eares, and stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge to their vnderstanding, they are forced to harken to that which they attaine not, and remaine distracted from that which they woulde doe. But in the olde Latine Seruice when the priest saied his <hi>Confiteor,</hi> all the Parishe woule knele downe and lifte vp their hartes to God with him. Likewise some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what before the Sacring, when the priest speaking more alow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de, beganne to saie <hi>Per omnia secula seculorum,</hi> and that which foloweth, the whole Parish woulde stande vp, and lifte vp their hartes also to God with the priest, deuoutely attending the presence of their Maker in those most Holy and Dreadful Mysteries. Neither was there any so ignorant in al the parishe which did not at that time lifte vp his harte to God with the Priest, though he vnderstode no one worde that the Priest saied. For they came then to the Seruice to praye vnto all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God: They came to Sermons to lerne and to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed. In this deuotion many a thousand of englishmen, though they vnderstode no one worde of the Priest, haue yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

the greke Church, though he spake generally, yet his wordes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re to be drawen only to that which was of him intended, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che was only the greke Churche, as it shall anon appere.

But as in bothe these lawes, the generall wordes are to be restrained to the intent of the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we maker, whiche is vnderstanded, either by the Common maner of speache vsed in such lawes (as in the Case of generall pardons) or by the persons intended in the lawe, as in the firste Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </label> Gregorius Haloander, whom M.

His intent in this place was to shewe that the faithe of the Romanes whiche the Apostle S. Paule commended, remayned still in the same feruour and zele, as it did from the beginning.

If the crying out of Amen maye either pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uethe Vulgar Seruice or the Constitution of Iustinian to be generall and to extende to Rome, then M.

            <p>The verye wordes of D. Harding being laied forthe will soone answer all this wondering of M. Iewell. His wordes in the texte are these. <hi>And thus he ordeined for the greke Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che onelye, and thereto onely it is to be referred, for that some thought the Sacrifice should be celebrated rather with silen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, after the maner of the Churche of Rome, specially at the Consecration.</hi> In these wordes D. Harding reporteth the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Churche of Rome specially at the Consecration time to haue bene, to speake in silence, where as the grekes vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered those wordes allwaies alowde. But the agreing of S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustins wordes withe the meaning of Iustinian is spoken of the Churche of Afrike not of the Churche of Rome. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine of vttering the wordes before the Consecration, as <hi>Sursum corda</hi> and such like (as by the Conference of S. Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian alleaged by M.

Thirdly the agreing is this, that nei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther Iustinian nor S. Augustine, do speake any thinge for the Vulgar Seruice, but only for the lowde speaking of the priest, whiche though it were vsed in Afrike, yet will it not folowe that it was vsed in Rome. Last of all though we graunted that bothe Afrike and also the Churche of Rome vsed suche lowde speaking of the priest at the Common Seruice in Saint Augustins time, yet it will hardly folowe that the same was done by the force of Iustinians Constitution made a full hundred yeares after, or that the Churche of Rome shoulde

therefore be subiect to that the lawe made so many yeares af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

Beside all other giftes (of prophecy, of healing, and of toun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges) there was also a gifte of praier, whiche was called, the gifte of the Spirit.

And he geueth hereof the reason, shewing also the maner in these wordes. <hi>For whereas not knowing what is good for vs, we aske many thinges of God that are not profitable for vs, this gifte of praier came vpon some one of them whiche then liued, who for suche thinges as might be profitable for the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, bothe stoode him selfe and praied for all the other, and also taught the other.

               <hi>here calleth by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of Spirit bothe suche a gifte, and also that soule which receiued such gifte, and praied vnto God and mourned. For he that was foun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de worthy of this gifte, standing vpp withe great compunction off minde, and also with much lamentation, such lamentation I saie, as from the harte lyeth prostrat before God, and praieth for all suche thinges as are behoofull for the congregation. Of the whiche maner, the deacon at this daye is a token praying for all the people.</hi> Thus farre Chrysostome. This praying by the waie of a miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous gifte, was no sett, ordinary, and appointed Seruice, to be readen out of the booke, as nowe we haue it, and as in Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostoms time it was, but a maner of miraculous praying vpon the sooden, so as the Spirit moued. Againe he that had this gifte of praying, did not onely praye him selfe, but also <hi>alios edocebat,</hi> he taught and instructed other. To praie, it was not requisit he should be vnderstanded. For that was done <hi>gemitibus ijs qui ipsa quidem mente deo se prosternunt</hi>: by sighyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, suche as from the harte doo prostrat them selues before God. But to teache other, it was necessary that he shoulde be vnderstanded. Therefore when anye man vsed that gifte of prayer withe the gifte of tounges together, praying in a straunge tounge, without <hi>prophetia</hi> the gifte of vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding added thereunto, <hi>he spake mysteries, he prayed to God, he edified him selfe, he prayed in Spirit.</hi> But he edified not the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:5494:134"/>

When he so praied, the lerned him selfe whiche supplied the roome of the ignorant did not vnderstande him, nor coulde not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer Amen to his praier. Why?

               </note> There nedeth not such a longe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of giftes. It is but one thing that I desir, that I seke for. That your neighbour may be edified. Loe here is according to the doctores Iudgementes, the whole issue, processe and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, of the blessed Apostle in that Chapter, whiche also in that which foloweth he prosecuteth yet more, geuing a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular order howe they shall speake with tounges, and howe they shall interpret one after an other, not talke confuselye without an interpretour. We see the whole drifte of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle is that the Corinthians in vsing the gifte off tounges, shoulde adde also the Interpretation thereof vnto it, that the Audience might be edified. Here it may be obiected. If the Apostle require the Corinthians to haue an interpretation and exposition of that whiche was spoken in straunge toun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, at the time of Common Praier: doth not the same reason binde vs also to haue our Common praier either in no straun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge tounge at all, or els to haue with all an Interpretation the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof, to the entent that the people nowe also maye be edified? To this I answer diuers waies. And Marke well gentle Reader our answer herein. First I saie the Apostle speaketh not of the
<pb facs="tcp:5494:137"/>
straunge tounges vsed at seruice time, at the Oblation time, at the time of celebrating and Ministring the holy mysteries, but at the time of preaching. Proue this you saie. Thus I proue it. First, the Apostle persuadeth in all this Chapter, the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians not to affecte so much the gifte of tounges, as the gifte of Interpretation. And the reason he addeth, saying. <hi>He that speaketh in the tounge, speak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>th not to men, but to God. For no Man heareth</hi> (that is, vnderstandeth) <hi>him. But in the sprit he speaketh mysteries. Nowe he that prophecyeth</hi> (that is, which interpreteth and expoundeth) <hi>he speaketh to men,</hi> he speaketh <hi>to edifie, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort and to conforte.</hi> Nowe who doubteth but this edifying, which consisteth in Exhortations, and in Counforte geuing, apperteineth properly to homilies, sermons, and preaching? In this case therefore it is necessary that the people vnderstande that which is saied. Nowe in the Oblation, and holy ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is a time of praier, not of exhortation and preaching. This to be the ende, intent, ad drifte of the Apostle it appeareth by this entry and beginning which he maketh. To this purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se hath he alleaged all that before hath bene saied, as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parisons of the musicall instrument, of the Trumpet, and so forthe. At the ende also of his disputation it appereth yet more euident. For thus he saieth. <hi>Si ergo conuenit vniuersa ecclesia, &amp; omnes fore loquantur, intrent autem idiotae &amp; infideles, nonne dice<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t quòd insanitis</hi>? If there the whole Congregation doe mere to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and all speake with tounges, and then bothe ignorant men and infidels doe enter, will they not saye, that you are madde? Lo, that whiche the Corinthians did in these assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, where they spake in tounges and so forthe, was so open, that infidels and all might enter and bothe haue and see what was done. But such might only come to Sermons, not be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent at the holy ministration. Therefore that which the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians did in those assemblies was no parte of the holy mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration or oblation, wherein the mysticall praiers were vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:5494:137"/>
The maior or first proposition of this argument is the expresse saying of the Apostle. The minor or second proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is euident and manifest to all that are lerned and expert in the practise of the primitiue Churche. For as the Catechu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mins, so muche more all infidels departed out of the Church as soone as the sermon was done. To the sermons the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels came sometime, and to nothinge els. To certaine praiers also the Catechumins were admitted, but not to all. Whereof we read of <hi>Missa Catechumenorum,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>August. fer. de <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

By these therefore it is euident that this vsing off straunge tounges was not at the time of Prayer and oblation, but at the time of sermons and exhortations. And this be the first answer.</p>
            <p>Secondarely I make this answer. The Apostle in dede amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge other examples, as of the Musical instrument, of the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, of priuat comunication, of priuat praier, bringeth also for example, the Common praier vsed in a straunge tounge, when he sayethe: <hi>If thou blesse in spirit, howe shall he that supplieth the roome of ignorant, answer, Amen.</hi> That is, as hath bene before declared, if thou geue the Benediction in a straunge tounge, by that miraculous gifte of tounges, howe shall &amp;c. But here (and marke well gentle Reader) it is to be vnderstanded, there are two sortes of straunge tounges. One is <hi>prorsus peregrina,</hi> vtterly straunge and foraine as well to the lerned as to the vnlerned, as well to him that supplieth the roome of the ignorant, as to the ignorant him selfe. So Chrisostom a greke Father, reakoneth vp for such straunge tounges, <hi>the Persian and the Romaine,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

Vpon this distinction of straunge tounges it is euident that though the Apostle by the waye off an example, blameth the blessing at Common prayer made in a straunge tounge, that yet he meaneth not by that straunge tounge, that whiche is the Common lerned tounge of the Churche, and whiche he that supplieth the roome of the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant is acquaynted with all, though it be a tounge of the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant him selfe not vnderstanded, but that he meaneth ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by such a straunge tounge, as was vsed by the miraculous gifte of speaking withe tounges, and whiche was so straunge, that neither the ignorant, nor he that supplied the roome of the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant vnderstode, yea and the whiche the Minister or priest him selfe vnderstode not.

To awn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer therfore shortly to the obiection made, I saie. The Chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe disputation of the Apostle in that Chapter is not of straun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge tounges vsed at the Oblation and praier, but at the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons and preaching.

toucheth nothing the Seruice of Christes Churche now vsed in the Common lerned tounge.

The thirde awnswere maye be, that the same blessing in Spirit in a straunge tounge (whiche the Apostle by the waye of example bringeth in) though it was done in the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon praier, yet that blessing was no parte of the Common praier, sett in bookes, and ordinare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vsed (as we haue it nowe, and as in Chrysostomes time they had it) but it was a blessing or thankes geuing that some one of the Congregation vsed vpon the soden being moued and stirred thereunto by the Spirit, as we haue before out of Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome proued at large. By all this it maye appeare that this fourtenth Chapter of the firste to the Corinthians, as of M.

<pb n="122" facs="tcp:5494:145"/>
people it selfe confesseth, they are much distracted from their deuotion, by attending to the Minister reading the Seruice and not vnderstanding it. Yea do not your owne doinges M. Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well confesse it? You haue taken order in certaine places of the realme (as we certainely vnderstande) that betwene your ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins and the Communion there be a staye made of halfe an howre or so, to thentent the people in that meane while may attende to their priuat praier and priuat deuotion. Why is this order taken, but bicause at Seruice time the people is distracted from priuat praier, and priuat deuotion? And truly herein, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the priuat deuotion of the people be not much more now distracted by harkening to there english Seruice which yet they vnderstande not alltogether, then it was att the latin Seruice, when they vnderstode nothing, I dare to make the people itt selfe iudge thereof. The reason M. Iewell, why you esteme the english Seruice to encrease deuotion, more then the latine, is bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause you imagin for certain that the people vnderstandeth it. As I will easely graunt they do sometimes vnderstande some part thereof: so that they do allwaies vnderstande the whole, though you would graunt, yet no wise man wil graunte it, and the people it selfe, I dere wel say, wil denie it. Verely I haue hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de of a Gentleman which reading the Booke of the Statutes in english, confessed he oftentimes vnderstoode not what the Sta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tutes meaned. And doubtlesse Holy Scripture iff it were not much harder then the english Statutes are, so many lerned com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries shoulde not haue ben made thereupon: so many he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies had not ben grounded vpon the doubtefull interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof. Brefely itt had not bene so many hundred yeares read only in the lerned tounges greke and latin. The Scripture therefore being not allwaies vnderstanded though in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tounge, no maruaill if the people be some times distracted. For when the Minister readeth on still, and the people Harke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thereunto knoweth not what it meaneth, what shall they
<pb facs="tcp:5494:146"/>
do? Shall they harken? It is to no profitt. Shall they let the Seruice goe and fal to priuat praier? Your order is against it, whereby if any harken not to the Seruice, he shall be taken for a papist. Thus by your vulgar Seruice the people ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is forced to be idle, or if he will be well occupied, incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rech displeasure.

And being not here, why re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port yow it so, as though it were here? What singular thing here is attributed to S. Paule, which maie not be saied of euerie of the Apostles? And thinke you, that euery one off them, went through out and about the world, and that euery one of them preached personally in the Ile of Britannie?</p>
            <p>If yow had saied (as of Theodoretus Authorite) that all the Apostles came at the begynning to this Ileland, It woulde haue seemed incredible. For, there were more Countres (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side Britannie) to be gone vnto, and all the Apostles neither could nor woulde goe to euery place, nor it is likely they would al of them goe to one litle Ileland, so far from the most populouse nations of the world.

Yet not only S. Paule, but all the Apostles are mentioned by Theodoretus.</p>
            <p>But what to haue done? To haue gone personally ouer the world? No truly, but to haue instructed the worlde and to haue brought them vnto hym that was Crucified. And how thinke you, might not that be done without their presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce. Who doubteth thereof, but he that hath no experience. For euen at this daie the Fishers and Publicanes and sowers of Tentes, whom Theodoretus speaketh of, which are S. Peter, S. Andrew, S. Iohn, S. Iames, and S. Matthew, And S.

<pb facs="tcp:5494:149"/>
by their Gospels and Epistles by their Praiers, and not by personal and visible presence of bodye.</p>
            <p>See then how openly M. Iewell deceaueth thee (Christian Reader) by drawing that specially to S. Paule, which is spoken of all the Apostles generally. And by referring that to the Persons them selues, which is vnderstanded of their writinges only or their succession.</p>

For in this one sentence he hath couched three moste mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest Vntruthes. First that the same slaughter was made vpon the refusall of the Brittaines accorde. For longe before that slaughter the holy bishop Augustin departed this life,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 2.</note> as Bede in that Chapter recordeth. Wherby it is euident that. S. Austin was not the cause of that slaughter,<note place="margin">Polidore also wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:5494:157"/>
whom Bede in the last chapter of the first booke compareth to Saul for his great Victories. M. Iewell named for Ethelfri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus the heathen, Ethelbertus the Christened kinge, that it might seme to haue bene done by S. Augustins procurement. Thirdly he calleth them <hi>godly Religiouse Men,</hi> who were in dede obstinate schismatikes, as the which being gently admonished of their schismatical Obseruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinewed notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding peruersely in the same,<note place="margin">

In whose wordes I beseche thee gentle Reader consider thre thinges. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First that the Charge of the VVhole Church and Principalite thereof is committed vnto Peter. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondarely that the Commission of that charge was made by our lorde and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour him selfe to Peter by name, and that in three seuerall ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes in the gospell. In S. Matthew at his Confession of Christ. Before Christes passion, when the Apostles were in most da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unger to falle, and after Christes passion for full confirmation of all that went before. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Last of all that not withstanding all that preemine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Peter, notwithstanding the Charge that he had of the VVhole Church, not withstanding he was Prince of all the Apostles, and had the Principalite of the whole Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che committed vnto him, notwithstanding I saye all this, yet by the name of an Vniuersall Apostle he was not called.</p>
            <p>Touching the first point, note the matter and pithe of this Article to be confessed, which is the chefe gouuernement of Christes flocke in the Bishop of Rome. For as Peter was Bishop of Rome, as the Churche to him committed endureth
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:5494:159"/>
for euer, as that Authorite was not geuen for Peter only, so are the Bishops of Rome his successours, so doth that commission endure for euer, and so doth that Authorite take place, force, and effect for all the Church of Christ, from that time fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde for euermore. Therefore Chrisostom saieth expressely, that Christ did shead his bloud, <hi>vt pecudes eas acquireret,</hi>

In which wordes we see M. Iewell the chiefe gouuernement in Christes flocke to be confessed in Peter the Bishop of Rome, and in his Successours.</p>
            <p>Touching the seconde point, that this chiefe gouuerneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t so co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fessed is grounded vpon the Scriptures, and Authorite of our Sauiour him selfe. For S. Gregory after he had affirmed this chiefe gouuernement in Peter, he added the reason thereof and saied. <hi>Ipsi quippe dicitur.</hi> For to him it is saied: Fede my shepe. Lo vpon this Commission of Christe geuen in holy Scripture to Peter Only, Gregory groundeth the Authorite of Peter. So doth also Chrysostom in the place aboue alleaged.</p>
            <p>Touching the last pointe, marke I beseche thee (good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) diligently, that though such principall Authorite ouer the whole Churche be graunted in Peter, yet he is not fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> all that called an Vniuersall Apostle. The Power is confessed, the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me or Title is denied. Right so of any Bishop of Rome euer sen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce Peter, that title or name of Vniuersal Bishop, was neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired nor vsurped. And yet the Authorite notwithstanding hath bene bothe confessed and practised. Neuer Pope more practised this vniuersall Authorite then Gregory him selfe. His writinges, decrees, and Epistles yet extant doe most euidently
<pb facs="tcp:5494:160"/>
declare it. Yet no man euer more abhorred the name then he. M. Iewell in all this Article hath not shewed One Pope that euer called or wrote him selfe Vniuersall Bishop. It is therefore a great vanitie and but a point of a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentious sprit in M. Iewell, to crie and call vpon the name of Vniuersall Bishop in the Pope, the power and Authorite vniuersall being confessed, the name also by the Pope him selfe neither desired, neither vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped. For as S. Augustin most truly telleth you M. Iewel. <hi>Quid est contentiosius quàm vbi de re constat, certare de nomine</hi>?

You bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he denieth one, would force him to denie bothe. Thus M. Iewell (not D. Harding) altereth and mangleth <hi>S.</hi> Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.

            <p>These wordes M. Harding thought good to nippe of in the middes. Such is his dealing in the allegation of the Auncient Fathers. If I liste to vse his owne termes, I might well call this Foysting or Cogging, or I know not what.

            <p>You teache vs still M. Iewell howe to answere your owne demeanour. This worde (Whole) wherein the effect of S. Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gories meaning stode, M. Iewell thought good to nippe of in the middes. Such is the dealing of M. Iewell in the allegation
<pb facs="tcp:5494:162"/>
of the Auncient Fathers: So he corrupted before Clemens Alexandrinus, S. Ambrose, Seuerus Sulpitius, S. Hierom and others. If I liste to vse M. Iewelles termes, I might saye he had the Choynecough &amp;c. Certainly the holy Fathers in the Councell of Constantinople saie thus. It is not mete for Catholike men thus to choppe and to pare the sayinges of the holy Fathers. It is rather the very property of heretikes. <hi>Exore tuo te iudico serue nequam.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>As for the sentence which M. Iewell chargeth D. Harding to haue nipped of in the middes, neither was it in the middes, but a sentence folowing, neither did the omitting thereof any thinge derogat from the meaning of S. Gregory. M. Iewell the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore hath talked hetherto against him selfe pleasantly and largely, but to the matter he hath yet saied nothinge. Neither doth he say any thinge in many wordes after. He imagineth D. Harding to obiect that S. Gregory though he blamed the name of vniuersall B. in Iohn of Constantinople,<note place="margin">A fayned obiection of M. Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well.</note> yet he clai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the same to him selfe, as a title only belonging to the See of Rome. Hereupon he heapeth vp a Mayn number of sayin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of S. Gregory against the title of Vniuersall bishop as well in him selfe, as in any other. All that is to no purpose. For it is not here defended by D. Harding. And it is not in this place at all disputed of, nor at al in any other place vpholded in that sence as S. Gregory blameth it. It is neither required nor vsed of any Pope. Therfore M. Iewell I may well call your labour therein <hi>Vanitas Vanitatum.</hi> For it is a great token of idlenes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se to be so earnest and so copious in disprouing that thinge that no man affirmeth. And yet M. Iewell so forceth this matter, as if all the right of the cause lay vpon it. It is a lewde kinde of logicke so stoutely to disproue that no man defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, and to leaue that thinge vntouched, which only shoulde be answered.

Gregory, or of his predecessours, or of any Pope sithens, that M. Iewell is able to name. And therefore S.

Iewell imagineth, bicause by that Title he woulde become Head of all the Churche, but the reason which S. Gregory principally forceth against the bishop of Constantinople, and for the whiche he him selfe and his predecessours refused that Title, is, that by the same Title he would be the bishop Alone, the Patriarche Alone, the priest Alone. To Conclude. S. Gregory forceth two reasons against the bishop of Constantinople, why he may not be called the Vniuersall Bishop. And he geueth one reason why he and his predecessours haue refused that Name. The two reasons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Bishop of Constantinople are these. First and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally bicause <hi>appetit solus episcopus vocari,</hi> he coueteth to be called the only Bishop: bicause by that Name, <hi>Patriarcharum nomen coeteris derogatur.</hi> Other Patriarches are made no Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arches at all.

In this Matter therefore, in this proude vnlawefull attempt of the Patriarche of Constantinople, what did the Bishop of Rome, or howe demeaned he him selfe therein? We shall see.

This did Pelagius vnder whom that Ambitious Title of Iohn the Patriarche of Constantinople was first attempted. But what did Saint Gregorye his nexte Successour, a man of suche humilite and lowlynesse, that he woulde not suffer (as Master Iewell alleageth) the worde of Commaundement to be vsed to him? Did he thinke yowe (Master Iewell) not practise the like Authorite, as his prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours did? Or bicause he was a holye and lerned Father, abhorred he (thinke yowe?) suche kinde of Superiorite and primacy ouer other? As the bishops of Rome, his predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours vsed? Nay he saieth expressely, speaking of the proude disobedience of Maximus a bishop of Salona in Illyricum, who had in the open Cyte rent in pieces, the Popes letters, <hi>Ante paratus sum mori,</hi>

And bicause the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour (as I saied before) bolstered vp this Iohn the Patriarche in his Attempt, and woulde not heare the Pope to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, S.

that they ought to suffer these thinges, yet the sinnes of the Apostle Peter are none at all, that in your dayes he shoulde so suffer. Thus that holye and meke Father dealed bothe withe Iohn the Patriarche him selfe, and with the Emperesse, at the first.

Whereas after the dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the of this Iohn, Cyriacus his successour in Constantinople, had called a Synod vpon some other pretence, minding in coulour thereof, to establish this vaine Title of Vniuersall bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, as being the One Only Bishop for all, S.

            <p>Fourthely (as I noted before) diuers holy Fathers and Aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient writers haue alleaged in their lerned writinges yet extant and not doubted of, certain Canons of the Nicene Councell, which a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </label> Now to your second Vntruthe M. Iewell couched in your laste wordes alleaged, where you saie, that by those authentike copies it appeared, that the Pope had falsified the holye Councell. This as I saied, is a Manifest Vntruthe ioyned with a slau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der. Vntruthe, bicause the Authentike copies, whereby you would proue the Pope a falsifier, are now proued to be no Authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke copies, but to wante manye of the assured Canons of that Councell. For if Zosimus be a Forger or falsifier of the Nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne Councell, bicause the Canon which he alleaged out of the Nicene Councell, was not founde in those copies sent from Alexandria and Constantinople, then is S. Hiero<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, S. Ambrose, S. Augustin, yea then is the Apologie of Englande a Forger and a falsifier of the holye Councell, whiche hathe alleaged a Canon out of the Nicene Councell not founde in the copies sent from Alexandria and Constantinople.</p>
            <p>A slaunderous Vntruthe it is, bicause M. Iewel hath no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor thereof but his felow protestants of Magdebourg and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che

            <p>So saieth M. Iewell. But then lett vs consider the reason of the Canon. The Canon saieth.

               </gap>he like maner, order, and authorite of Iurisdi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. What? hath the bishop of Rome the like Iurisdiction ouer Aegypt, lybia, and Pentapolis, and shal therefore the Patriarke of Alexandria haue the same? Doe those two wordes <hi>Parilis mos</hi> necessarely inferre so much, and can they not otherwise be expounded? Then two seuerall Patriarches must haue one and the like Iurisdiction. Then which what ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be more absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de? What then? Shall therefore the bishop of Alexandria haue such and such Countres allotted vnto him, bicause the B. of Rome hath such and such other Countres? And what reason is this to make a Decree, I appeale to al men of reason and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding. This might perhaps serue for a like and simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, as that the B. of Alexandria shoulde be the Patriarche ouer such Countres, Euen as the Bishop of Rome is the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arche ouer other Countres.

of the Decree. It is not brought as a Like or Similitude to exemplifie the decree. Therfore it can not be taken as M. Iewel fantasyeth, to signifie a like maner and Authorite of Iurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the bishop of Rome. But it must of necessite signifie a Superior Authorite of the B. of Rome.

was there a Copie sent, but not published by the Aphrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes? If the first, as likely were the other to haue the Copies corrupted and imperfect, as that Patriarkeship vtterly to lese them. If the seconde, then dealed not the Aphricanes so vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly as they might haue done. Verely the Aphricanes them selues in their letters to <hi>Caelestinus</hi> the Pope, certifying him of the receyte of those Copies from Alexandria and from Constantinople, do not auouche them for the absolute true and only Copies, but do call them <hi>Concilia veriora,</hi> the truer Copies of the Nicene Councel,<note place="margin">

            <p>Againe Marcus the bishop of Ephesus, one that of all other forceth most this dealing of the Aphricanes against the See of Rome, affirmeth that the Aphricanes sent not to Cyrillus and Atticus, but to Cyrillus and Proclus.

            <p>M. Iewell is not contented to auouche an Vntruthe vpon D. Harding, but he addeth also a manifest and Captain Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truthe of his owne making beside. For first Iustinian the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour writing to Iohn the seconde Pope of that name calleth his holynes by these very wordes: <hi>Caput omnium sanctarum ecclesiarum:</hi> The head of all holy Churches. And in an other Constitution he saieth expressely. <hi>Vt legum originem anterior Roma sontita est, ita &amp; Summi Pontificatus Apicem apud eam esse <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the very decree,) is here spoken of other bishoppes, and that by the waie, not expounding what that Prerogatiue was, or to whom it belonged. Yet M. Iewell with his accustomed modesty and shamefastnesse, telleth vs: This priuilege graunted to the bishopp of Rome, to be the first of all priestes (which are the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des off themperour Iustinian) was onely in generall meetinges and Councelles to sitte in place aboue all others.

For this edict must nedes be refered to the Canons off former Councelles which the edict expressely nameth saying, <hi>Secundum Canonum definitiones,</hi> according to the determinations of the Canons.

<pb facs="tcp:5494:223"/>

            <p>In the second place alleaged by M. Iewell out of S. Paule he not only wresteth S. Paule to a contrary meaning,<note place="margin">M.

Nay are they not expressely submitted and put vnder the same? And thus M.

But iff the party accused desiring his cause to be hearde ones againe, do intreate the Bishop off Rome to send legates from his side, it shall be in the power off the Bishopp to doe as he shall thinke good. And if the Pope determine to sende such as may iudge the matter with other bishops, hauing his Authorite from whom they are sente, that also shall be at his arbitrement.

Thus farre the decree of the great Councel of Sardica made anon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Nicene Councell, for the establishing and confirming of the same, by the consent of 300.

In this Decre we see a plaine and large Appeale to the See of Rome, to determine the matter either by his ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne Legates, either by such other iudgement as he shal appointe.

            <p>Before I open the Vntruthes off M. Iewell in these fewe wordes alleaged, Let vs first consider (gentle Reader) the matter a parte by it felfe. M. Iewell must proue, there laye no Appeale to Rome. For this purpose he alleageth S. Ciprian complayning of the rashe and ofte running to Rome about Ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>peales. And what other thing doth al this proue, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that at the same time appeales laye to Rome, but S. Cyprian was offended therewith? Thus M. Iewell telleth vs that Appeales laye to Rome, and yet saieth he will proue that none laie to Rome. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine S. Ciprian was offended, not with the Appeales it selfe simply and absolutely, But (as his wordes do expressely saie) <hi>with their sutle and deceitfull rashenes</hi> aboute Appeales. And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o was S. Bernarde in his time (as we shall anone heare) offended with Appeales, and yet no man more expressely witnesseth the Authorite of Appeales to Rome then he. So at this daye the late Generall councell of Trident hath cutt of a number off Appeales fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Rome,<note place="margin">

               </gap>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of most matters, not yet for all that abolishing all Appeales to that See. Thus also S. Cyprian who liued longe before the Nicene councell in a tyme of persecution, when les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se cause of contention was offred, was worthely offended with the rashe and vnruly behauiour off cer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ine which ranne to Rome, and abused the good Pope Cornelius with false and deceitefull tales, as in this epistle S. Ciprian mentioneth. Agai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:5494:235"/>
this semed to be a decree amonge the Africanes euen in S. Ciprians time, that no suche Appeale should be made out off their countre. For so dothe S. Ciprian beginne this sentence, <hi>Cum statutum sit omnibut nobis, aequumque ac iustum sit &amp;c.</hi> Seing it is decreed amonge vs all,<note place="margin">M. Iewel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les true dealing.</note> and is also meete and right that the cause shoulde there be hearde where the faulte is committed. etc. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Now M. Iewell hath omitted those first wordes of the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and committed a wilfull Vntruthe, to make the Reader beleue that S. Ciprian spake and reasoned generally against all Appeales, not of any Statute or decree touching the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tre of Aphrica. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Againe whereas he concludeth of <hi>godly Fathers and Bishoppes in olde time,</hi> he hath made an Vntrutbe.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> But for euident proufe, that this Nouell Constitution off Iustinian maketh nothinge at all against Appeales to Rome, let S. Gregory one of the foure Doctours <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And it is not to be feared that he will vsurpe a more Vniuersal Authorite then was dewe to the See of Rome, who did so much inueigh and was so earnestly bente against the Name or Title of Vniuersal bishop. S.

It is to be thought that S. Gregory vnderstode this Nouel Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of Iustinian as well as M. Iewell dothe. And verely though <hi>S.</hi> Gregory had not expressed that case, wherein the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision of the matter ought to be ended before the bishop of Rome, notwithstanding the lawe of Iustinian commaunded that the Patriarche shoulde ende it, yet other lawes teache vs that such a case being omitted, the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lawe leseth not the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore her force.

            <p>Here is a heape of Great, Mighty, Maine, Huge wordes to Amase the Reader: But in dede a Fardle of Open, Clere, and Manifest Vntruthes to Deceiue the Reader.

The wordes alleaged by M. Iewell in Latin, are translated of Erasmus or some such late Writer of our daies. The wordes whiche nowe we will alleage, are trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated out of Chrysostomes Greke Epistle to Pope Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, by Palladius sometimes the scholer off Chrysostome him selfe, and a lerned Bishoppe off Helenopolis. Whereby it is easy to be iudged, whiche translation is worthy of more cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit. Palladius therefore writing the whole life of Chrysostom his master, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prising in that the story of his great trouble, and banishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, in the which he Appealed to Pope Innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tius, recordeth the very letter that Chrysosto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sent to Innocentius,<note place="margin">

M. Iewell. For where you saie, <hi>these holy Fathers being thus in extreme miserie &amp;c.</hi> You meane and speake of Chrysostom, Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius and Theodoret. As touching Chrysostom and Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret they liued at the lest the one a hundred and more, the other al most two hundred yeres after those troubles and miseries happened in the East Church. Those troubles aboue mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned happened al in the reigne of Constantius the Arrian Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, and towarde the ende of his Empire.

Vnder Arcadius those troubles of the East Churche mentioned by M. Iewel vtterly ceased. Now to allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge those troubles so longe before passed and appaised, to be the cause of Chrysostoms, and of Thedorets Appeales to Rome which so longe after folowed, who seeth not that it was imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently and impude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly alleaged?

            <p>Athanasius obeying the Summoning came.

<pb facs="tcp:5494:250"/>
him a legacy to the Pope, to accuse Athanasius. At this second coming to Rome, Athanasius founde there Paulus the bishop of Constantinople, Marcellus bishop of Ancyra, Asclepas bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Gaza,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cap.</hi> 15.</note> Lucianus bishop of Adrianopolis, all complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in like maner to the Pope for iniuries done vnto them by the Arrians. Nowe first let vs consider that the first flight of Athanasius to Rome was before the troubles mentioned by M. Iewel: and that therein (as I saied) he hath deceiued his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, making that to be the cause of Athanasius flight which happened after his flight. Secondarely that he bringeth of Paulus the bishop of Constantinople that he was hanged, you perceiue I trust already, that therein also he hath brought that for a cause which happened after the effect. Vnlesse M. Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel wil saie that Paulus was ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged of the Arria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, before he ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me to Rome to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaine of the Arrians. Likewise that he tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs of Lucius otherwise Lucianus bishop of Adrianopolis that he died in preson, it must nedes be after the first coming of Athanasius to Rome, seing that in his seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d coming he fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de the same Lucius or Lucianus at Rome. Marcellus also of Ancyra who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he founde at Rome at the same second coming could not be the cause of Athanasius first coming to Rome. Now that which foloweth in M. Iewelles allegations of The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odulus and Olympius commaunded to be murthered, and of the Emperours fury against Athanasius commaunding him to be brought aliue or dead,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cap.</hi> 38.</note> all this happened after the third flight of Athanasius, and a great many yeres after his first flight to Rome, of the which only D. Harding here mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and against the which M. Iewell would driue all these troubles of the East hetherto alleaged, all befalling (as you see) longe after the same. Thus you see how that all these alllega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions proue nothing against the matter alleaged, and therefor were brought in by M. Iewel only to Dase and Amase his Rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der for the time, that after he might worke his feate at pleasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re.
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:5494:250"/>
For now, where it foloweth in M. Iewel, as we haue before tolde you his wordes, <hi>These godly Fathers being thus in extreme miserie, &amp;c. sought to the Churche of Rome,</hi> you see neither Chrysostom nor Theodoret (who liued so many yeres after all these troubles appeased) neither Athanasius whose flying to Rome talked of in this place, happened before all these troubles, can be any of these godly Fathers that M. Iewell concludeth of. But only these godly Fathers Chrysostom, Theodoret and Athanasius are alleaged here to haue sought to Rome. Ergo all this hath bene brought vtterly beside the purpose, only to deceiue and abuse the well meaning Reader. This is the sincerite of M. Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, when he semeth to talke most lernedly.</p>
            <p>To shewe farder that Athanasius in his second flight to Ro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me, that Paulus of Constantinople, Marcellus of Ancyra,<note place="margin">Paulus of Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople and diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of the East Appealed to Rome.</note> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sclepas of Gaza, Lucius of Adrianople all lerned and Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke bishops of the East Churche (who mett there at that time all together) fled not thither (as M. Iewell imagineth) bicause they knewe not whether els to flie, but to be restored againe to their bishopprickes by the Popes authorite, that therefore I saie, they fled and for no other cause, let vs consider shortly what the ecclesiasticall history reporteth herein. The history writeth thus. <hi>Cognoscens ergo Romanus Episcopus</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The bishop of Rome therefor hearing the accusations and complaintes of eche one,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

               <hi>and finding them al to agree to the Nicene Councel, receiued them in to Communion, as hauing charge of them al, through the dignite and praerogatiue of his owne See, and restored to euery one their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: He wrote also to the bishops of the east, that they had not wel v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed innocent me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> driuing them from their Churches, that also they kept not the constitutions of the Nicene Councell. Some of them also he commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded to appeare before him at a certaine daie, that they might knowe he had pronounced a iust determination of them. He tolde them also he woulde not from hence forthe suffer them, onlesse they leaued such disorder and innouations in the Church. Thus wro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
<pb facs="tcp:5494:251"/>
the Pope. And Athanasius and Paulus sending the Popes letters to the bishopps of the East, recouered eche one againe their bishoppric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes.</hi> Thus farre the Tripartite Hstory out of Sozomenus. Whether all this declare not a Supreme Authorite in the See of Rome ouer the East Churche no lesse then ouer the west, I leaue it to the discretion off euery wise Reader to considre. Let vs now returne to the discourse of M. Iewell and see how he procedeth herein.</p>

Though the epistles of Chrysostom can not helpe you, yet perhaps <hi>the bishop of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes dealing therein,</hi> and <hi>the ende of the cause</hi> will helpe you. For by these two waies more, you promised to proue that Chrysostom made no Appeale. Let vs then see, what the bishop of Romes dealing herein was.</p>

Yow knowe M.

            <p>This was euen nowe before alleaged. It hath before bene answered vnto. Yet againe I saie the stubbornesse of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian bishop and the Arrian Emperour Constantius caused the Pope thus to doe. In like maner Paulus Samosatenus being condemned by a great Councell of bishops at sundry times and yet not obeying thereunto, but continuing still in his bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricke, the matter was referred by the bishops them selues to Aurelianus then Emperour being a heathen and infidell. The extreme stubbornesse of that heretike forced those bishops so
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:5494:258"/>
to doe. Yet it is not therefore to be concluded that either bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops ought not to Iudge vpon heretikes, or that the Prince especially being vtterly an heathen and infidell, ought to ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke that Iudgement vpon him. Againe if the Pope at this daye vse the secular Arme to the repressing of heresies, it is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the misery and wickednesse of our time, it is no ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument against the Popes Supreme Authorite or Iurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>

As in a Case. Iohn being cast by the Archedeacon, Appealed to the Archebishop, where as he should first haue appealed to the bishopp, as to a nerer Superiour. But this errour doth not hurte, bicause he appealed to a higher Iudge. The same Iohn from the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chedeaco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:5494:263"/>
appealed to the Officiall of Cau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>terbury, where as he shoulde haue Appealed to the Iudge of the Prerogatiue Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te. This errour hurteth not neither, bicause he Appealed to a Iudge equall and off like Authorite to that Iudge to whom he ought to haue Appealed. Therefore his Appeale shal procede before the Iudge to whom he should haue Appealed, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the errour committed in meaning an other Iudge, being his equall. In the thierde Case Iohn Appealed from his bishop to an other bishop, where as he should haue Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the Archebishopp. In this case he looseth the benefyt of Appeale. Bicause he hath appealed to a Iudge, neither higher, neither equall to that Iudge to whom he ought to haue Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed, that is to the Archebishop, butt to an inferiour Iudge. For the bishop to whom he Appealed, though he be equall to the Iudge who before had geuen the Sentence, yet he is infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to the Iudge to whom the Appeale ought to be made. In this case therefore the Appeale is voide. The wordes the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore of Ostiensis and of the glose saying that the errour hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not when the Appeale is made to an equal Iudge, doe not meane,<note place="margin">The true meaning of Osti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ensis his wordes.</note> a Iudge equall to the party Appealing, or equall to the Iudge from whom the Appeale is made, but they meane a Iud<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ge equall to him to whom of right the Appeale shoulde haue bene made. It is therefore a manifest Vntruthe, contrary to al lawe and reason that M. Iewell saieth. Appeales maye be made not only from the lower Iudge to the higher but from equal to equal And to saie that Ostiensis or the lawe so saieth, it is a double Vntruthe.<note place="margin">

But no Inferiour or equal can correct the Iudgement of his superiour or equall, bicause he hath no rule ouer such. Therefore no Inferiour or equall can take an Appeale from his Superiour or equall. Againe the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:5494:263"/>

<pb facs="tcp:5494:268"/>
the lerned and godly Fathers in those dayes dealed with such which woulde from bishops appeale to the Ciuill magistrat.

Thus Farre Agatho the Pope in that epistle sent to the Sixt generall Councell, read in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:5494:272"/>
and allowed by their commom consent all crying, <hi>in ea per Agathonem Petrum loqui,</hi> that Peter speake in that letter by the mouthe of Agatho.

Therefore vndoubtedly either that Councell is nowe corrupted, as the fifte general Councell was by heretikes, or els Honorius was condemned not as Pope, nor as decreeing and defending that heresy by publike autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, but as holding that hereticall opinion by him selfe, and as vttering the same in his letters to Sergius of Constantinople. And then Honorius was in dede condemned there for an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retike, but not the Pope: Els Pope Agatho had most impude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abused the Councell, and the Councel no lesse wickedly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled his falshood, when bothe he auouched that none of his predecessours had bene heretikes, and that his auouching the Councel allowed. Hereunto may be added that Photius the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Constantinople, writing of the seuen generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celles, and reakoning vp al that were in those Councelles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, maketh no mencion at all of this Honorius Pope off Rome.<note place="margin">

This is all that Ruffinus telleth of them. They laboured to reduce men to the Catholike Faithe. They founde Hilarius so doing of his owne heade without any commission. Here was no correcting or visiting by waie of authoritye, but only a zelous labour towarde a reformation, such as Hilarius tooke vpon him without any commission or commaundement, and such as manye a good man woulde perhaps take in our owne countre, if a tyme of reformation were graunted, without any breache or diminishing of euery bishops Authorite in his ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne Dyocese, or of the Popes primacy ouer all.

Which also our most godly Emperour and our Brother Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius bishop of that Cite do continually professe. Yet if she or any other Churche haue any good thinge to be folowed, I am ready to folowe my inferiours in good thinges, whom I for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bidde from vnlawfull thinges. For he is vnwise which thinketh him selfe therefore to be chiefe, that he may neglect to lerne the good that he seeth. Thus farre holy S. Gregory. In whom we see notwithstanding he wrote letters of conference to the bishop of Constantinople, and calleth him here his brother, yet he calleth him his inferiour, and dissembleth not that his Churche is subiect vnto him. And in the next epistle he wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth of the bishopp of Constantinople, that being accused of a certaine crime, the Iudgement was referred vnto him of the Emperour <hi>iuxta statutae Canonica</hi> According to the statutes of the Canons, not by the mere will or commission of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour.

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:5494:284"/>
and the other Patriaches, and yet they notwithstanding be subiect vnto him, S.

               <hi>And he will praise thee. For he is the minister of God to doe the good. But if thou do euil, then feare him.</hi> Thus S. Gregory was brother to al other bishops, wrote familiarly and frendly vnto them vntell they offended. Then he woulde vse and shewe his power ouer them, euen ouer the bishop of Constantinople him sefe, the chiefest of all the Patriarches after the Pope. So he excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated Iohn of Constantinople: so he iudge ouer Eusebius bishop of the same See: and so he expressely professeth and putteth it out of doubte that the Church of Constantinople is subiect to the bishop of Rome. And thus M. Iewelles vnfal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible token is not founde to be so much as a bare gheasse. But voide of al truthe and weight. By such false sleightes and seely surmises M. Iewell maintaineth his schismaticall disobedience against Christes Vicaire, and draweth other to the snare of his schisme.</p>

If I offende not the lawe, the magistrat hath nought to doe with me. He can not commaunde me. But the Master may commaunde his seruaunt, do he well or euill. The Pope is not so primat ouer other bishops that he hath them at commaundement as seruauntes.

So Athanasius bishop of Alexandria being cited to the Churche of Rome, appeared there as to his superiour, So Cyrillus bishop also of Alexandria, was legat to Pope Celestinus in the thirde Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councell of Ephesus.

is layed not vpon the Popes restoring, but vpon Basilides his wronge information. And this Sabinus continued bishop not contrary to the confirmation of Pope Cornelius, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the restitution of Pope Steuen. And yet not bicause Pope Steuen restored Basilides, but bicause Basilides had mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se informed Pope Steuen. Thus M.

               </note> I aske M. Iewell. Where was this ecclesiasticall rule or Canon decreed? There was no general Councell before that time but the first Nicene Councell. The great Councell of Sardica was helde certaine yeares after, though in the time of this Iulius, as it appeareth euidently by the auncient stories, and by the new Chronographies. It coulde be no Canon of any prouinciall Councell, that should make such a generall decree, to binde Sy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ria it selfe and al the East to the Authorite of the bishop of Ro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me. I aske M. Iewell then by the waie, where was that Canon decreed? Let him scoure out his note bookes, let him examine the Centuries of the Magdeburgenses, let him looke to the common approued tomes of the Councell, he shall finde it no where decreed before that tyme, but in the Nicene Councell, and in the Nicene Councell he shall finde it decreed, not in the imperfect copies commonly extant, nor in the corrupted authentikes alleaged of the Africanes against pope Zosimus: But he shall finde it in the epistle of Iulius this same Pope he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re mentioned, to these same Arrian Bishoppes of the Easte. For in that epistle complayning of their schismaticall Synod, and blaming them therefore, that neither he nor any in his place was present thereat, he geueth the reason saying, <hi>Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus quippe in Nicena Synodo iubentibus, &amp;c.</hi> Seing the Canons in the Nicene Councell do commaunde, that without the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorite of the bishopp of Rome, Councells in any wise ought not to be celebrated, nor bishops be condemned.

Valentiniam the Emperour and Eudoxia his wife, at Sainte Peters Churche, with many of the bishoppes kneeling on their knees, to require the Emperoure Theodosius, that an other Synod might be called to reuoke those things which Diosco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus (the heretike bishoppe of Alexandria) had concluded in the condemnation of Flauianus the Catholike bishoppe of Constantinople, and in the deposing of the Catholikes. Thus farre the wordes of Liberatus.

If this be admitted, what doe we professe a Christen faithe any longer? What do we talke of Fathers and Councelles, if when Fathers and Councelles are brought, we must yet proue farder that the Fathers speake truly, and that the Councelles saye well. This is not to be tried by the Fathers: but it is to trie and examine the Fathers them selues. And then they are not our Fathers, but our scholers.

            <p>You might haue added here M. Iewell, so in the late gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councell of Trent, the Oratours of the Emperour and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery Catholike prince there present, confirmed the decrees of the Councell. And yet neither the other examples nor this late example is any thinge like to the confirming of the bishop of Rome, The bishop of Romes confirmation is so necessary that without it, (as the Canons do commaunde) no Councell can be kept. No bishop nor prince hath such a confirmation. As for example, Theodosius which you alleaged first, confirmed the Councell of Ephesus. And yet that Councell was after and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer sence accompted for no lawfull Councel bicause the lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of Pope Leo were not admitted, but by violence of the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retike dioscorus iniured.<note place="margin">

               </note> Therefore as all your other examples do proue a godly zele in these good Catholike Emperours, and do shewe howe necessary it is that the secular power do aide the spirituall, yet no Emperour or laie prince euer confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med any Councell, as the Iudge and president hereof. To be shorte. The bishop of Rome hath in all Councelles a negatiue voice, as without whose, none can be approued: for so doth the Canon, mencioned in the Ecclesiasticall history, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely witnesse. Such a negatiue voice, such an absolute and supreme Authorite in approuing Councelles no Prince nor Patriarche hathe, but only the bishop of Rome successour to Peter chiefe of the Apostles.</p>

And this hauing longe sought where and howe to pitche, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing dased his Reader, with a longe variable tale from the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, sodenly he concludeth: <hi>And therefore Iulius</hi>: &amp;c. But what? Is therefore the story vntruly alleaged of D. Harding? Is it therefore proued that the Pope had no authorite to Sum<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mon Councelles? Is this M. Iewelles Reason? The Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Patriarches is specially required to allowe Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, The Pope is the first off the foure-Patriarches, Ergo the Pope hath no authorite to summon Councelles? Or. Ergo D. Harding hath falsified the story off the Councell off Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che? For this is the Conclusion whiche M. Iewell tooke v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon him to proue. This is the vntruthe, which he noted. And yet nowe, M. Iewel after longe roning and wandering vtterly forgetting what he shoulde doe and where aboute he went, telleth vs that the story is true, and al is wel alleaged: but an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther faulte there is. And that is this. In dede the Councell off Antioche was voide and of no force for lack of the Popes Au<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thorite, M. Iewel confesseth. But that was, not as he was Pope, but as he was one of the Patriarches. This is a prety co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uayance in dede. But M. Iewel should proue it to be so. Verely he hath such a custome to lie, that his bare worde hath but smal credit. Then let vs consider his proufes. He saieth.</p>

it is proued of the bishopp of Rome? This is not true, and this M. Iewell is neuer able to proue. Againe this Councell off Antioche was no generall Councell, but a Councell off the East Churche only. Thirdely this difference and prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue off the bishopp off Rome in approuing Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celles aboue other patriaches appeareth most euidently in this very example off the Councell off Antioche. For not only Iulius the bishopp off Rome, but Maximus the bishopp off Hierusalem, another off the Patriarches, was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent from that Councell of Antioche. And yet the ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call history making mention thereof, geueth no token of disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulling the Councell by reason of his absence, as vndoubtedly it woulde, had his presence bene of such necessite. But the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me history making mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the bishop of Romes absence, ge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ueth out forthewith a reason, why the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel should be voide saying. <hi>VVhereas yet the Ecclesiastical rule dothe Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunde, that without the bishop of Romes Authorite no Councells ought to be held.</hi> Such an Ecclesiasticall rule disallowing Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uncelles for wante of the Authorite of any other Patriache or metropolitane can not be shewed. And therefore the second Councell at Ephesus was disanulled, bicause the Popes legat was repelled, though all the patriarches beside were present. Di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>oscorus of Alexandria, Iuuenalis of Hierusalem, Flauianus of Constantinople, And thus though all the Patriarches were summoned, yet the absence of no one Patriarche, but of the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Rome only, did disanull any Councell. This is the thinge that proueth a superiorite in the bishop of Rome aboue all other bishops. This M. Iewel should haue disproued. But with all that he had saied, he is not able. Wherefore his Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion folowing must nedes hange very loosely, where he saieth.</p>

            <p>Albeit it were true, that Reconciliation of it selfe were no necessary token of Primacy, yet this Reconciliation, being off the Chiefest prelats and Patriarches in Christes Churche, to the See of Rome, this Reconciliation also being ioyned with the other argumentes of Primacy in the Apostolike See off Rome, (as Appeales, Confirming of Bishoppes, Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations in all partes of Christendom, Restitutions of bishops and Confirmations of Councelles) it is a necessary and suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient argument for the Primacy and Souueraintie of that See aboue all others. For as many Circunstances may make a good and sufficient euidence, where one Circunstance alone coulde proue nothinge, so the argument of Reconciliation being ioyned with the other, is sufficient for the acknowlead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and confessing of a Primacy.</p>
            <p>Againe if Reconciliation be no argument of Primacy, M. Iewel should haue done well either to haue shewed that the bishop of Rome was reconciled to other bishopps as well as other bishoppes were to him, or els to haue geuen a reason howe it came to passe that the bishop of Rome was neuer in
<pb facs="tcp:5494:325"/>
such sorte reconciled. Verely beside the examples alleaged he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re by D. Harding of the Africane bishops reconciled to Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facius the seconde, and of Alexander the Patriarche of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioche reconciled to Innocentius, bothe bishops of Rome: we reade also, that the Bishops of the East, who were no parte off the bishop of Romes peculiar prouince or Patriarkeship, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vniustly deposed Flauianus of Constantinople, and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly consented to Dioscorus the Eutychian, were not only reconciled by Leo the B. of Rome, but did also require that Reconciliation, and in the reconciliation did abide the Order prescribed by the Pope.</p>

            <p>We see by the first wordes alleaged that they were reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led not only to the Communion of their owne Churches, but also to the Communion of the See Apostolike, and that they desired such a Reconciliation. If this had bene but a Common Reconciliation as betwene frendes and equalles, whiche haue bene at variaunce, it had bene enough for them that they were restored by the Popes legates to the Comunion of their owne Churches. It had not neded to haue had beside a Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and a restoring to the Communion of the Churche off Rome.</p>
            <p>Againe we seee in the wordes in the second place alleaged,

that a kinde of discretion was vsed in graunting the Reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which importeth a Soueraintie in the graunter, and a kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de of subiection in the party reconciled.</p>

This Reconciliation admitting some and repelling other by Authoritye, is a clere and manifeste to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of a Primacy and Soueraintye in the See Apostolike ouer the bishops of the East. For albeit in the waye of Charitye one aequall may be reconciled to an other, yet in the way of Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce one aequall hath no power to punish the other, that will not be reconciled. This Reconciliation therefore to the Pope off bishops not properly subiect to his Diocese or prouince, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein as some are reconciled, so other are repelled, is a necessarye token of Primacy in the Pope ouer more bishoppes then of his own prouince, which Primacy in no other B. or Patriarche can be shewed. Against such a Reconliation he speaketh not one worde. Onely he reasoneth that euery Reconciliation im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth not a Primacy. Whiche thinge is not auouched by D. Harding. But only that by such a Reconciliation as was made vnto the B. of Rome, of them as were not of his own prouince or Diocese, a Primacy of the Pope was acknowledged and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>This loe is the Iudgement of S.

Other bishops so to haue spoken, it had ben in dede neither right nor conuenient. This therefore being so clerely affirmed of Innocentius a Pope of such Authorite well nere twelue hundred yeres paste, in two sundry epistles, and by the Iudgement of lerned S.

In the mean the Reader seeth, both that you haue (not ouerreached or missetolde) but flatly belyed your Author S. Gregory, and also howe D. Harding hath neither ouerreached nor missetolde his Author, but hath auouched that, which his Author expressely wrote.</p>
            <p>But let vs take S. Gregories wordes, euen as your selfe M. Iewell, hath alleaged them. Thus they stande. The name off <hi>Vniuersall bishop was offred by the Councel of Chalcedon to the bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop

of Rome.</hi> His wordes are not. <hi>The Councell offred to call him so.</hi> Therefore M. Iewell hathe ouerreached and missetolde his Authors tale.</p>
            <p>Nowe when the Councell offred that name to the bishop of Rome, I would gladly lerne of M. Iewel, how and by what meanes they offred it. Either they offred it by mouthe, or by writinge. If by writinge, then they intitled him so, and called him so in writing. If they offred that name vnto Leo by mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the, then they spake it out to his legates (for he him selfe was not present at the Councell) they spake it I saie and vttered it by mouthe. I trust M. Iewell will not saie. The whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell stode vp, and gaped vpon the legates, and profered to speake, but the legates before they spake or vttered any worde at all, desired them to holde their peace, and not to vtter their mindes. Vnlesse they did this, or some like thinge, it can not be true that M. Iewell saieth, <hi>They offred to call him so,</hi> but it must be true that D. Harding saieth, <hi>they called him so in dede,</hi> and that either by mouthe or by writing. For howe a name or title can be offred, without it be spoken or writen I knowe not.</p>

That is. To the moste holye and moste blessed <hi>Vniuersall archebishopp and Patriarche</hi> of the great Citie of Rome Leo, and to the moste holy Councell assembled together in the Citie of Chalcedon according to the will and commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements of God, by Sophronius a Christian man. Will this Example please you M. Iewell? This is an Example of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Churche. This was neither poore deacon, nor straun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge priest, as you terme them scornefully, more like a Hicke scorner, then like a Bishop, but this was a Christen laye man and as it appeareth a man of worship. For in his Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Pope and to the Councell, wherein he accused <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oscorus</hi> the tyrannicall Patriarke of Alexandria, he added, that many other coulde saye as muche as he saied against the same <hi>Dioscorus,</hi> but that <hi>siue pro paupertate, siue pro timore eius tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nidis non sunt ausi,</hi> partly for pouerty, partly for feare of his ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny they durst not. Wherby it appeareth, this Sophronius was neither poore, neither of such a state as he neded to feare the Patriarke.</p>
            <p>Nowe bicause M. Iewell vrgeth this matter and woulde make it of no force, bicause no bishop did so call the Pope in the Councell, I would wishe M. Iewell, if he can, to satisfie and solute these questions.</p>

If not the bishoppes, then either the Emperour and his Councell, or the notaries and inferiour clergy of those bishoppes did offer that name and Call his predecessours by that name. And then it was not the Councell at all that did it. For a Councell con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth of bishops, not of the laye magistrat, or of the inferiour clergy.

any one writer before the age of that fonde frier Martin Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that euer wrote the contrary. It is maruail that M. Iewell auouching this matter so stoutely, and building his Vntruthe thereuppon, would yet in all his text, bringe no proofe, no reason, no argument at al to confirme it.

Iewell auoucheth that only Peter was called Head of the Churche, and yet his assertion nothinge weakened there by, let vs shortly See a reason or two that may be Framed thereof.</p>
            <p>S. Peter by M. Iewelles confession, was called Head of the, Churche of the Fathers.</p>
            <p>S. Peter was Bishopp off Rome within the first .600. yeres. Ergo the Bisshopp off Rome was Called Head of the Churche within the first .600. yeres. Nowe bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause M. Iewell saieth that only S. Peter was so called, let vs proue the like of Damasus an other bishop of Rome .400. yeres after Christe, by the argument that D.

            <p>

            <p>
               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:5494:347"/>The Minor or second proposition is euident by the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of S. Ambrose alleaged. The Maior or first proposition is euident by S. Paules very wordes, whiche are these. <hi>These thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges I write vnto thee</hi> (o Timothee) <hi>hoping to come shortlye vnto thee. But if I slacke to come,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. <hi>Timo.</hi> 3.</note> (I haue thus writen) <hi>to thentent thow mayest knowe howe to behaue thy selfe in the house of God, whiche is the Churche of the liuing God, the Piller and grounde of truthe.</hi> Loe this howse of God which S. Paule here speaketh of, is that Church which is the Piller and Grounde of truthe. Suche is no particular Churche, but only the Vniuersall Churche. For Particular Churches may and haue erred many, but the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall Churche can not possibly erre, and hathe neuer erred. She is the Piller, She is the Grounde of Truthe. Against her Hell gates shall not preuaile. Thus the former Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions being bothe euident and true, the one out of S. Paule, the other out of Holye and Lerned Saincte Ambrose com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting vpon S. Paule, the Conclusion must nedes folowe, which is, that Damasus the Pope Ruled the Vniuersall Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, not only his owne dyocese, or patriarkeshipp of Rome. Nowe if the Ruler be not the Heade, I would M. Iewel should instructe vs what the Head of a companye or common wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the signifieth, other, then the Ruler of that company or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon welthe. Thus M. Iewell hath in termes equiualent the Head of the Vniuersall Churche. And a bisshopp of Rome so called farre within his first 600. yeres. If therefore M. Iewell made his Challenge at Paules Crosse for the honour of God, for boulting out of the Truthe, and for the matter it selfe whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is in controuersy, he must according to his promise yelde and Subscribe to this Olde holy Father S. Ambrose. If he did but dally and to ye about certaine termes and phrases, then the worlde may knowe and See, what trifling Sermons prelats and Preachers of this newe clergy not only doe make and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce, before their honourable and worshipfull audience,
