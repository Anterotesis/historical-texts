            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE lamentable ignorance and ungodlineſs of too many of the common people, and the pride and ſelf-conceitedneſs of many Profeſſors of godly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the weakneſs, unſettledneſs and giddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of others, doth give advantage to all ſorts of Hereticks and Deceivers to make their attempts with hope of ſucceſs. And to our wonder, grief, and ſhame we ſee, that ſcarce any of them are ſo groſly unreaſonable and vile, but they get ſome followers in moſt places where they come: And when this wind ariſeth to try our Congregations, and neighbours, the light, unſtable, chaſſie Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors are carried away. And though one ſect have carried away ſome of them, and another hath riſen and condemned that, and carried away more; and another and another have done the like by them; yet ſtill the next ſect that riſeth up, is as confident that they are in the right, and as zealouſly vent their own conceits, and condemn all others, as if they had never been warned by the examples of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny before them, whoſe confidence hath left them in contempt, like Prognoſticators, Wizards and falſe Prophets, that will be bold to propheſie of uncertain events, though ſo many of their predeceſſors have leſt their names to the deriſion of poſterity; We cannot won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der therefore, if among other ſects, the Quakers (with their <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Brethren, the Paracelſians, Behmeniſts, and Seekers) do ſtep in and take their turns in the game; who will come down with greater ſhame then moſt that have gone before them, when they have plaid their part.</p>

one God, one Mediator between God and man, one holy Spirit; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a member of that one Catholick Church, which is not confined to the ſect of Papiſts, or the ſect of Anabaptiſts, or any ſect, but containeth all the true Chriſtians in the world, though ſome parts of it be Reformed and pure, and others more deformed and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt: having one Catholick Rule, the Word of God; and a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Love to all Chriſtians in the world, with a care and deſire of their welfare, proportionable to their ſeveral degrees of lovelineſs, Being my ſelf a member of this Catholick Church, and finding my ſelf on the Rock which the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt, the ſecurity of my ſtation encourageth me the more boldly to do my part in defending the cauſe of God, againſt the aſſaults of all theſe deluded ones; and particularly the Quakers. And if any man find in himſelf the leaſt temptation to like of their way, I ſhall here give him thoſe Reaſons in a little room that move me to conceive, that no Chriſtian, or reaſonable man, ſhould be a Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, or approve of, or excuſe their way.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. The Quakers (with the Seekers) deny and revile the Church and Miniſters of Chriſt, and yet cannot tell us of any Church or Miniſtry which is indeed the right, and to be preferred before theſe that they do deſpiſe. If the Quakers are of no Church themſelves, they are no Chriſtians; and then they are Infidels, Atheiſts or Heathens. If they be of the Church, let them tell us which is the Church that they are of. They renounce the Church that we are of: and that is the only Church on earth, containing all true believers in Chriſt. They have not told us of any ſect but their own, which they take to be the true Church: And he that takes the Quakers to be the only Catholick Church, muſt deny the Church and Chriſt himſelf, if he underſtand what he ſaith. For the Quakers are but of a few years ſtanding: They roſe from among the Papiſts, Seekers, Ranters, and Anabaptiſts but a while ago. And if Chriſt had not a Catholick Church before then, and ever ſince his Aſcenſion, he ceaſed to be Chriſt in Office, the Head and Saviour of the Church: For no Church, no Saviour; No bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, no Head: No School, no Teacher: No Kingdom, no King: No Wife, no Husband. So that its all one to ſay, that the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers have made a new Catholick Church, when there was none be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and to ſay, they have made a new Chriſt, where was no Chriſt before. This Argument the Papiſts abuſe upon falſe ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions; but it is only the Catholick that can make juſt advantage of it, and may better ask the Papiſts, <hi>[Where was your Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church before</hi> 400. <hi>or</hi> 500. <hi>or</hi> 600. <hi>years after Chriſt?]</hi> then they can ask us, <hi>[Where was your Church before</hi> Luther:] Where there were viſible Societies of Chriſtians, there was a viſible Church. I dare not be of ſo narrow a Catholick Church as the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60961:3"/>
Papal is, much leſs as the Quakers or any upſtart ſect; I profeſs my ſelf a member of a far wider Catholick Church then all of them ſet together; in which I hope to live and die.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſon</hi> 2. No wiſe man can be a Quaker, becauſe their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is an uncertain thing; And ſo is not that Religion that muſt ſave us. The things that they agree in, beſides the furious oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of others, are but a few broken ſcraps of Doctrine, which they never yet ſet together, as making the ſubſtance of their faith: I never met with man that heard of any ſum or body of their Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, Faith or Religion, which they have publiſhed: No not ſo much as in Catechiſm, or ſhort Confeſſion: Nor did I ever hear that one of their Speakers did ever recite the ſubſtance of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. If they know not yet the contents of their own Religion, they are too blame to be ſo zealous for it, and thruſt that upon others, which they know not themſelves: and well may we ſtay till they know it better, before we become their followers for we know not what. The Chriſtian faith is known long ago, even this 1600 years, and more. If they ſay that they wait till the Spirit revealeth it; I anſwer, The Spirit hath revealed and ſealed the Chriſtian Faith long ago: though it muſt tranſcribe it out of the Scripture into the heart of every believer. The Spirit is not given now to make us a new Religion, or new Goſpel, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 8, 9. but to cauſe us to believe and receive the old one. I abhor any Goſpel or Religion that was not made 1600. years ago at leaſt. If they look for a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to make them a new Religion or belief, they have not, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect not the Chriſtian Religion or belief. Well, and will any but a mad man let go his Chriſtian Faith, before he know where to have a better? or for he knows not what? ſhall we turn Quakers meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe they bark and bawl at our Religion, Miniſtry and Church, before they once tell us where to find a better, or give us ſo much as a Catechiſm, or Confeſſion to tell us what their own Religion is, which they would have us to receive? We know not but the fag-end of it that is yet out of ſight, may be ſo abominable as to ſhame all the reſt; I am reſolved to be of no Religion that is kept in the pockets of men, and muſt not be all made known to the Church, as the Papiſts keep things undetermined, to make us new Articles of ſaith <hi>(quoad nos,</hi> as they ſpeak) when they pleaſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſon</hi> 3. No man of Reaſon ſhould be a Quaker, conſidering that among thoſe ſcraps of their Religion which is made known, there is ſo much notorious falſhood and ungodlineſs. Its like to have a good end that hath ſuch a beginning. This falſhood and wickedneſs, cannot ſoder with ſaving truth. The very perſon of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt many of them blaſpheme, and ſpeak allegorically and equivocally when they mention his name and nature, and ſo ſhew
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60961:4"/>
that indeed they are not Chriſtians. One of them lately ſpoke to a Chriſtian in theſe words, <hi>[I deny the God that thou worſhippeſt.]</hi> The Scriptures, many of them in my hearing and in others, have denyed to be the rule of Faith and Life, and the Hebrew and Greek text they expreſly ſaid, they do deny. They reproach the Catholick Church, and the Miniſters: They deny many of Gods Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; not only the Baptiſm of Infants, but of any; and uſe not the Lords Supper: They deprave the Doctrine of Juſtification, deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the imputed righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and truſting to that which is in them only: Many more ſuch abominations they maintain, which certainly tell us they are not of God. If any man ſay that all of them are not of theſe opinions: I anſwer, What a fair di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted company are they already then, when they are of ſo many minds, and we are never the nearer knowing what they hold by hearing and reading the ſayings of ſo many!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſon</hi> 4. Beſides their falſe pernicious Doctrines, their Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Religion doth much conſiſt in notorious wickedneſs, injuſtice and uncharitableneſs. I ſhall here inſtance but in three parts of it. 1. Their very preaching and zealous talk is much, if not moſt of it, malicious prating againſt Gods ſervants, (3 <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.) and railing accuſations and reviling words; yea lyes and ſlanders; impudently charging that upon the Miniſters of Chriſt, which they have not ſo much as a reaſonable pretence to accuſe them of. There is ſcarce a ſcold heard among us in ſeven years time, that uſeth ſo many rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words to the baſeſt that they quarrel with, as theſe people will uſe familiarly in their Religious exerciſes againſt the faithful ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Chriſt. Nay I have had more railing language from one of them in one letter, then I ever heard from all the ſcolds in the Countrey to my remembrance this twenty years. And no ſervant of Chriſt who hath learnt of him to be meek and lowly, can believe (if he be well in his wits) that this is the language of the Spirit of Chriſt. He that being himſelf reviled, reviled not again, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 23. and hath commanded us not to eat with a railer, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 11. and hath given ſuch an odious Character of ſuch, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 10, 11, 12. <hi>Jude</hi> 8, 9, 10, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will hardly own them for his beſt ſervants. If we may judge what Countrey men are of by their language, theſe are not of heaven, nor fellow-Citizens with the Saints, that ſo reproach and rail at Saints. And it is the more impious in that they entitle God to it, and think they do him ſervice, by reviling his ſervants: yea, and abuſe the phraſes of Scriptures to it; as if they might call ſuch by any names which God hath called the worſt of men by; Even dogs, wolves, greedy dogs and hirelings, children of the Devil, and enemies of all righteouſneſs, hypocrites, Devils, with abundance ſuch. 2. They break the fifth Commandment by open diſhonouring of Magiſtrates and Miniſters, and impenitently
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60961:4"/>
juſtifie themſelves in all. They will not only deny civil honour to the Magiſtrate, but revile him if he diſpleaſe them. Their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage is like the rebellious followers of <hi>Corah, Numb.</hi> 16. 3. <hi>Ye take too much upon you—wherefore liſt ye up your ſelves above the Congregation of the Lord?]</hi> 3. Many of them live idly and diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, going up and down the Countrey, and living on the bread of others, and not working with their hands, contrary to 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3. 6, 11.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſon</hi> 5. The worſt of all is, that they behave themſelves like Malignant enemies to the very <hi>Cauſe,</hi> and <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and <hi>Servants</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt. And if they be of the Serpentine brood, they cannot be the only ſervants of Chriſt ſure. Moſt of them that I have ſeen, have an altered countenance, looking upon every man that they ſuſpect to be a Miniſter or a friend to the Miniſtry, with ſuch deteſtation and hatred, as if malice it ſelf had choſen their faces to demonſtrate its complexion in. Their very deſign, Religion and work, is, to make the people hate the Miniſters and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile them as <hi>they</hi> do, as if this were a mark of a converred man. And beſides this Miniſtry (as much as they revile them) who have we to carry on the work of the Goſpel? A mean wit may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee what would come of the Goſpel, and of the Church, and the ſouls of men, if the Miniſtry were hated, rejected or caſt out. Doth it go well with any Nation on earth without them? Name me the place. Will the Goſpel be propagated without Preachers? Or have you better enough if all theſe were down? Where be they? that we may ſee and know them. He that would deſtroy the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, and Magiſtrates, is like to be an enemy to the Army and the Common-wealth. They take the ſame courſe againſt the Church and Cauſe of God, as the malicious enemies in all ages have done; even to oppoſe the beſt and painfulleſt Miniſters. Such as the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens tormented, and the Papiſts burnt, and others ſilenced, theſe men chooſe out to vilifie and oppoſe. Mark when they come to any Town, whether they do not ten times more oppoſe the Miniſters that ſpend themſelves in private and publick labours againſt ſin, then they do the moſt ignorant or vicious men. Cannot we ſee whoſe ſervants they are, when we ſee who they fight againſt, even the choiceſt ſervants of Chriſt! It is a wonderful thing that even Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant enemies ſhall be thought to be Chriſts only ſervants by any that know what it is to ſerve him, or what an enemy differeth from a friend.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſon</hi> 6. Moreover that part of the Quakers peculiar Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which conſiſteth not in errour and Malignant impiety, is very much of it made up of childiſh unreaſonable fopperies. When they have called me Dog and Devil, and abundance of ſuch names, and I have asked them what was my fault? forſooth, it was that I was
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60961:5"/>
called Maſter, that I ſtood above the people in a pulpit, that I preached by an hour-glaſs, that I preacht by Doctrine, and Uſe, and ſuch like. And doth the Chriſtian Religion conſiſt in ſuch ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous accuſations as theſe? Doth God lay mens ſalvation upon an hour-glaſs, or a Pulpit, or being called Maſter?

As for the grounds of theſe ſilly cavils, I have ſhewed in <hi>[The Quakers Catechiſm]</hi> how weak they are. Chriſt doth no more forbid the title of <hi>[Maſter]</hi> then of <hi>[Father]</hi> or then <hi>[ſitting in the uppermoſt ſeat]</hi> as you may ſee in <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. And ſeriouſly would theſe wiſe men have no man called Father, or ſit uppermoſt? It is the proud affectation of honour, and the abuſe of it that Chriſt doth forbid, and not the thing; when he hath made it the firſt Commandment with promiſe, that children (and ſo all ſubjects and inferiours) muſt honour their parents and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious in the Lord. See what a difference there is between this ſort of prophetical people, and the antient Prophets and Apoſtles of Chriſt. The Apoſtles of Chriſt did preach up Faith, and Hope, and Love, and a Kingdom conſiſting in Righteouſneſs and Peace, and Joy in the holy Ghoſt, and not in meats or drinks, Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or uncircumciſion. But ſee now a new generation of preachers; and what is their meſſage? I am aſhamed to mention it. They go about the world to preach down hour-glaſſes, and pulpits, and tithes, and the title of <hi>Maſter;</hi> Do you think that the ſalvation of the world doth lie upon this Doctrine? They come to preach down rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bons, and lace, and points, and cuffs: O glorious and excellent Doctrine, for children to make ſport with!</p>

All the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and Churches of Chriſt that adhere to the Miniſtry, they pronounce them, children of the Devil: and as ſoon as they do but hear a man ſpeak for the Miniſtry, though they know nothing of his life, they can preſently tell that he is an Hypocrite and child of the Devil; ſo quick and ſagacious they are in damning men, as if they were as forward to it as Chriſt to ſave, and pleaſed as much in curſing, as good men in bleſſing. Yea they muſt venture into the Throne of God, and ordinarily take on them to know mens hearts, to judge them hypocrites. Thoſe that dwell and walk with God, and have lain longer at his feet in prayers and tears, then any of them, and walk in uprightneſs in the midſt of a malicious world, and ſpend themſelves in the work of God; even theſe muſt be damned at a word by a boy or wench that's but a Quaker, as confidently as if God had bid them ſpeak it.

And to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Saints. 6. And to the Spirit which ſtill concur's with theſe.</p>
