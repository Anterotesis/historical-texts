            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

CONTINUATION
OF THE
HISTORICAL RELATION
Of the Late
GENERAL ASSEMBLY
IN
SCOTLAND, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>IT is in Writing as in Building, when once a man engageth him
self in it, before he hath done he is necessitated to carr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>y <hi>it on
further than what he first thought on.</hi> The Historical Relation <hi>of the
late General Assembly in</hi> Scotland, was at first extorted from me
by the Curiosity of a private Friend, who afterwards prevailed to have
it published: When I yielded to it, I thought my business was done,
and expected no further trouble, but now I am made to believe, that
there lies an obligation upon me, to continue the History of <hi>our Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians</hi>
in <hi>Scotland,</hi> because my <hi>former Relation</hi> hath increased in
many a <hi>Curiosity</hi> to <hi>understand more</hi> and more, of the <hi>Genius</hi> and <hi>Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi>
of that <hi>party,</hi> and because what I have done, will be incompleat
if I do not add to it an Account of the <hi>Commission of that Assembly,</hi>
for the <hi>South</hi> and for the <hi>North</hi> of <hi>Scotland.</hi> I know that by such en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprises,
I expose my self to the malice and aspersions of a party, of
whose Revenge and Calumnies we have frequent instances, but see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
I have already dipt my Hand in the affair, I will proceed in it, for
what ever prejudice it may be to my self, it may be an advantage to
Posterity to lay open the Errors and Miscarriages of those, who, to
the destruction of many, have set themselves up as the true Lights of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54716:3"/>
the World. The false Opinion which the World had of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi>
party, <hi>has</hi> twice been the occasion of Shipwrack to the Church of
<hi>Scotland,</hi> and it may be expected, that the shewing them such as they
are, may both prevent it a third time, and also help to recover it
for this, for I hope people will not be so mad as to suffer themselves
any more, to be led <hi>blindly</hi> by such Guides as they see have not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
enough to qualifie them for the Office; and who while they
pretend to be the purest part of Christians, commit such things as
even Heathens would <hi>scruple at.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since <hi>the publishing</hi> of the <hi>Historical Relation of the</hi> General <hi>Assembly,
they</hi> have <hi>Printed</hi> the <hi>principal</hi> Acts <hi>of</hi> the <hi>General Assembly,</hi> with an
<hi>Index</hi> or <hi>Table,</hi> of such <hi>Acts</hi> as were not thought fit to be published.
By this, the truth of many particulars in my former <hi>Relation</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,
only I find a mistake in one or two <hi>Acts</hi> I made mention of,
as also one or two more which were <hi>altogether omitted. In the 52d</hi> page
of the <hi>Historical Relation of the General Assembly, It was said that Peda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues,
Chapla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ns and Students, were appointed</hi> to <hi>own and subscribe
the Confession of Faith,</hi> but I find in the <hi>first Article</hi> of that <hi>Act,</hi> Intitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
<hi>An Act approving several Overtures, which relates to that matter. That
Probationers Licensed to Preach, Intrants into the Ministry, and all other
Ministers and Elders received into Communion with them in Church
Government, are obliged to this,</hi> and no mention of <hi>Pedag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>gues, Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains,
and Students;</hi> but I am <hi>assured,</hi> that they were <hi>named in</hi> the first
draught of the <hi>Act</hi> presented to the <hi>Assembly,</hi> and those who inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me, did not advert to the alteration of it, which was caused by the
<hi>Commissioner,</hi> who knew that otherwise it would occasion no little
disturbance in this Country, for as there were many <hi>Pedagogues and
Chaplains,</hi> who would have refused it, so the Families, in which
they are, would have been disgusted with the Government, if they
had been obliged to <hi>part with them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, it was said, page 61. <hi>That Mr.</hi> Gilbert Rule <hi>was joined to
Mr.</hi> Alexander Pitcairn, <hi>for writing an answer to the printed accounts of
the Persecution of the Episcopal Clergy, and that the latter had excused him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
for not doing it sooner, by the want of due information of matter of fact,
but it</hi> appears now from the Index of <hi>their imprinted Acts,</hi> that this task is
wholly committed to Mr. <hi>Gilbert Rule:</hi> And Mr. <hi>Pit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>airn</hi> declared lately
to one of my acquaintance, that he refused that employment altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
at the Assembly, because by some informations that had been sent to
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>he saw these accounts could not be otherwise answered than by justifying
of the Rabble, which he neither would, nor could do.</hi> My Authors
do not remember, <hi>that</hi> they heard such free and plain Language at the
Assembly, and certainly it was too <hi>remarkable</hi> not to be taken notice of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:54716:3"/>
but because Mr. <hi>Pitcairn</hi> saith it, I make no doubt but this hath passed in
some <hi>private Committee,</hi> where he hath expressed himself so freely
upon this head, that they found him too honest and <hi>ingenuous for serving</hi>
their designs, and have thought Mr. <hi>Gilbert Rule</hi> a fitter Tool by <hi>far</hi>
for their purpose. The time of the sitting of a new Assembly doth
approach, to which he is obliged to give an account of his diligence,
and yet nothing of this nature has appeared from him, from which we
may conclude, that he finds the task very hard for him, and that he is
much puzzled <hi>both</hi> at once to save his honesty, and to excuse his <hi>party.</hi>
If he be the Author of that Pamphlet, Intituled, <hi>A Vindication of the Church
of Scotland</hi> (which is an answer to the <hi>ten Questions</hi> about Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians)
as is commonly reported and believed, we may easily guess how,
and after what manner he is to answer these accounts, <hi>viz. First,</hi> By
an impudent denial of the Truth. <hi>Secondly,</hi> By extenuating the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
of our Clergy, in <hi>comparison of what they suffered;</hi> for it's said
there, that <hi>all the instances alledged are false, and that any one of many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them, suffered more than all the Episcopal Clergy.</hi> His <hi>ingenuity</hi>
in the first, appears from what I have said of Mr. <hi>Pitcairn,</hi> who refused
to make any reply to these printed accounts, because the information
sent to him confirmed the truth of them: And as to the other, tho it
were true that they suffered as much, or more, yet that is <hi>no reasonable
excuse</hi> for the present sufferings of the <hi>Episcopal Clergy;</hi> as the common
Proverb is, <hi>Two Blacks make not a White:</hi> Nor will it justifie the ills and
grievances of the present times, that in former times there were as great
and as many. If they had had a due sense of their sufferings, or if
they had rightly improved them, this would have prompted them to
Mercy and Compassion. The Spirit of Christ teacheth us as to bear
the Cross, when it is on our selves, patiently and chearfully, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>o to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
it in others, as much as is possible, and when it falls upon them,
to ease and relieve them all we can: It maketh men gentle and meek,
and to deal tenderly with one another, but it seems they are acted by
another Spirit, <hi>viz.</hi> A Spirit of Bitterness, Cruelty, and Revenge,
which makes them forward to render others miserable, and to take
pleasure when they see them afflicted. But it is not true, that either <hi>any</hi>
or all of them suffered so much as the <hi>Episcopal Clergy</hi> have in this Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.
Indeed, by the <hi>Act of Glasgow,</hi> which proved fatal both to
Church and State, a good many Ministers were laid aside, or rather
they made a pretext of it to lay themselves aside, thinking by their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
to render <hi>the Government</hi> odious, or to oblige it to revoke that <hi>Act,</hi>
which required their submission to Episcopacy; but this is nothing <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
to</hi> the treatment our Ministers met with from the <hi>Rabble.</hi> They
were forewarned by the <hi>Act of Glasgow,</hi> and had several months allowed
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54716:4"/>
them to deliberate upon it, and were suffered, <hi>even after</hi> the expiring
of the term prescribed by that Act, to possess their Houses, and to take
up their Stipends; nay, very many continued still in the exercise of their
Ministry, and were con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ived at by the Government till the year 1683.
and a great many also of those, who were actually turned out, were again
indulged by the Clemency of the <hi>King</hi> and Government, to go to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Parishes, which was the occasion of a Schism among them, for
they who had not the benefit of the Indulgence, envied them who had
it, and divided from them, and uttered bitter words against them,
which obliged them to make a Vindication of themselves in a Book, Intitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
<hi>A Review of the History of the Indulgence;</hi> but the treatment of our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
was summary, and the proceedings against them very cruel and
severe. The <hi>Rabble</hi> surprised them, assaulted them in the Night, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
them not the least respite, but Barbarously thrust them, their
Wives and Children, instantly out of Doors. Nor had they time given
them to dispose of their Goods, to gather in their Debts, or provide ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
sustenance for themselves and Families: So, many who might
have otherwise lived well enough, are at present in a starving condition,
and are necessitated to receive Alms, that they and their Families may
not quite perish. Besides, some have sustained the loss of their Wives,
others of their Children, <hi>and some</hi> of both, occasioned <hi>by the inhumane
usage</hi> of the <hi>Rabble.</hi> And whatever the <hi>Episcopal Clergy</hi> have suffered
at <hi>this time, they</hi> have suffered <hi>meerly upon</hi> the account of <hi>Episcopacy,</hi>
whereas <hi>in the late times, none</hi> ever <hi>suffered meerly upon the account of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery.</hi>
See Sir <hi>Geo. Mackenzie</hi>'s defence of the Reign of <hi>King Charles the</hi> 2d.
<hi>Some of them indeed</hi> were Hanged, as <hi>King,</hi> and <hi>Kid,</hi> and two or three
more, very deservedly, because they were guilty of Sedition and Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
against the Government. There was never any severity shewed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them, till they were found Ploting, and then <hi>indeed</hi> the security
of the Government did oblige our <hi>Rulers</hi> to have a strict eye over them,
and by all means to curb them. And what Government would not be
severe to men of their principles, who hold it lawful to Deth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

found nothing material for inflicting such a censure upon him,
and therefore gave their advice that he should <hi>be reponed,</hi> which was
done; but since that time, a <hi>Synod in Fife</hi> will have him again laid aside
upon the former Indictment, <hi>telling him, that the private</hi> judgment or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of <hi>a particular Committe,</hi> did not oblige them, seeing the Assembly
made no Act <hi>in his favour.</hi> `Again, it is said, that they will not <hi>depose
them simply for their judgment about the Government of the Church,</hi>
that is, for this thing only; but withal, it implies, that this may be one
reason, and we see it is often made a principal one, for they lay such stress
upon it, that for this cause they set Spies on persons actions, and search
out all that can be said to render any odious, who differ from them in
this matter. It is evident, that persons principles, together with the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
which they held, has been the great motive of prosecuting them hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto;
<hi>but what is most remarkable is,</hi> that its said <hi>they will not urge Re-ordination
upon them,</hi> for not to urge a thing, certainly imports this
much, That they may require it, tho for grave and weighty reasons they
will also <hi>dispense with it. It was advisedly</hi> done to make this only a <hi>Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the Moderator,</hi> for it would not probably have passed into <hi>an
Act;</hi> for tho there be none other in the World, <hi>who call in question the
lawfulness</hi> and validity of <hi>Episcopal Ordination (Boxter</hi> himself <hi>believed</hi>
it <hi>so necessary,</hi> that he would needs <hi>be ordained by a Bishop</hi> (if I remember
aright 'twas Bishop <hi>Hall</hi>) after he had received the Ordination of Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters)
yet the most of them at present, carry things so high, as to deny
<hi>the lawfulness</hi> of it, and there are some instances of <hi>Re-ordination</hi> in the
<hi>former times of Presbytery;</hi> so little do they regard the <hi>Ordination and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterial
Authority of Episcopal men,</hi> that it has been <hi>declared frequently</hi> in
their Sermons, that all the time of Episcopacy, people have been without
a Ministry, and without Sacraments. Some <hi>two</hi> or <hi>three years</hi> ago, there
was <hi>one</hi> who preached up this Doctrine so warmly, in and about the <hi>Lead-Mines of Hopton,</hi> that, as was reported, he prevail'd with many to suffer
themselves to be <hi>Re-baptized, and Re-married, and had twelve pence</hi>
from each of them for so doing. And one Mr. <hi>Cassine in Fife,</hi> when he
was admitting Elders in the <hi>Kirk</hi> of <hi>Flisk,</hi> caused them before the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,</hi>
to renounce their <hi>Baptism,</hi> and all the Sacraments and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
which they had received from <hi>Curates,</hi> as he called <hi>Episcopal Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters</hi>
by way of contempt. This is so true, that the <hi>Heritors</hi> and <hi>Parishio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi>
of <hi>Abdie,</hi> did upon this very head protest against Mr. <hi>Cassine,</hi> his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
amongst them; but notwithstanding this, the <hi>Presbytery of Couper</hi>
admitted him, so that it seems they have not look'd upon that as any
fault or errour.</p>
            <p>Now what jugling and hypocrisie is it? how do they play at fast,
and loose with us, when sometime they tell us, that they will make no
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54716:5"/>
difference on the accounts of mens judgments, and sentiments, about
matters of Government; and yet never check or censure such gross and
wild extravagancies; nay, so far from it, as to encourage such as are
guilty of them, and to be forward to settle them in Churches, while
others <hi>more moderate are</hi> slighted and neglected: As Mr. <hi>Alexander
Orrok,</hi> who (as all that know him say) has more sense and learning
than the most of them; and yet, for all the vacancies, they have never
bestowed <hi>one Church</hi> upon him. And <hi>they joyned</hi> with Mr. <hi>Rymer,</hi> to
<hi>keep</hi> him out of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> to which he had a Call, from the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian
party there, and where he himself desired to be: And all this,
because he is somewhat moderate, as to the distinguishing principles,
and entertains some favourable sentiments of many of the <hi>Episcopal
Clergy.</hi> And as they do not encourage their own, unless they be
rigid and severe about their modell of Government, and Discipline;
so they give all discouragement to such as have served under Episcopacy,
but are willing to submit <hi>to Presbytery,</hi> and to live peaceably with them,
Mr. <hi>William Hamilton,</hi> offered himself with such submission, that they
had no shadow of excuse, for refusing to admit him into their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion;
but they deny him all other kindness and favour, they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
offer to repone him to either of the Churches out of <hi>which</hi> he was
rabled, nor do they encourage any Call to any other; for they have
so concerted it among themselves, as that none shall invite him to
Preach, or any wise imploy <hi>him.</hi> He <hi>had</hi> lately an invitation to serve
the <hi>Cure</hi> at <hi>Curry,</hi> in the absence of another Mr. <hi>Hamilton,</hi> who <hi>is settled</hi>
Minister there; at first the <hi>Presbytery of Edenburgh</hi> agreed to it, but
afterwards Mr. <hi>Hugh Kemedy</hi> revoked the order, and dashed it out
of the minuits of the Presbytery with his own hand. He had also ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Call to the Kirk and Parish of <hi>Lauder,</hi> subscribed by the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
of the Town, and the most of the Heritors and Parishoners;
which when he presented to the Presbytery they rejected it, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
another made by five Weavers. We have another late instance of
their want of moderation towards these, who differ from them, in
point of Church Government, which if it do not expresly contradict the
abovementioned <hi>Declaration of the Moderator of the Assembly:</hi> Yet, it
clearly sheweth, that the inferiour Judicatures of Synods and Presbyters
are not of that mind, nor, resolved to bind themselves up to these mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures.

               </gap>ur preference of it to all others, we do think fit to continue the
restraint formerly laid upon you by the Presbytery.</p>
            <p>Whilst I am shewing my own omissions, I may be excused if I give
an account of an omission of the <hi>Clerk</hi> or <hi>Recorder</hi> of the Assembly: Who
had forgot to set down an Act said to be made by them, either amongst
the <hi>Printed Acts,</hi> or in the List of the <hi>unprinted ones;</hi> and I confess,
for his excuse that I cannot meet with any person, <hi>who</hi> remembers to
have heard it once mentioned in the Assembly: So that we owe the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
thereof, only to the <hi>Presbytery</hi> of <hi>Dalkeith,</hi> who lately declared it,
upon this occasion.</p>
            <p>They sent one or two of their number sometime ago, to the Parish
<hi>of Inverask,</hi> which lyeth within four Miles of <hi>Edinburgh;</hi> to entreat
them to choose a Minister; and because this people unanimously shewed
their aversion to a Presbyterian (for of three or four thousand in that
Parish, there are only some twenty, or thirty that incline to that
party) therefore there was a promise made them, that if they made
choice of any good or pious man, who would submit to the Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
he should be accepted of, whether he were a Presbyterian
or Episcopal; whether the person who promised this, spoke ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
his own sentiments, or the mind of his brethren; whether it
was said only to dispose the people to be more favourably enclined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the <hi>Presbytery of Dalkeith,</hi> or because they saw it impossible to
to get their consent to a Presbyterian Minister, I shall not enquire.</p>
            <p>But the Parish laid hold on this promise, and accordingly did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missionate
some of their number to wait upon the <hi>Presbytery of Dalkeith,</hi>
with a List of seven or eight persons, <hi>Episcopal Ministers,</hi> who had sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the Civil Government, and to entreat their allowance, for
their Preaching to them, according to the promise which was made
that such of them as pleased the Parish best might be called to be their,
Ministers. When this was first proposed, the Moderator huffed and
grew angry, and asked, <hi>if they came to abuse and reproach the brethren?</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:54716:6"/>
The Gentlemen replyed, they designed not to abuse any; that what
they alledged was true, and they were ready to prove it, or they would
appeal to the persons themselves, who had said it. Then the Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
told them, <q>That if any Brother had said or promised so, he had
done it rashly of his own head, and would receive a Reprimand
from the Presbytery for it, that the Presbytery could allow of no
such thing for there was <hi>an act of the, Assembly forbiding Episcopal Incumbents
to preach out of their own Churches, or people to give them a call.</hi>
               </q> So under
the shadow of this <hi>invisible Act,</hi> and, in all appearance, of their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vising,
they shifted the promise made to the Parish of <hi>Inverask.</hi> It
was said at that time, that there was no <hi>such Act</hi> in all the <hi>History of
the Assembly:</hi> To which it was replyed, <hi>that if it was not Printed, it would
be Printed very shortly,</hi> which I have done, lest the honest man should fail
in his word.</p>
            <p>Before I leave their <hi>Acts,</hi> it will be fit to take notice of the reasons
of <hi>An Act,</hi> which was mentioned in the <hi>Historical Relation of the Assembly</hi>
viz. <hi>An Act</hi> which prohibiteth <hi>private use and Administration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
on any account whatsoever.</hi> The Reasons of this <hi>Act</hi> are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to be remarked.</p>
            <p>The first of them is, <hi>That by the Authority of this Church, in her former
Assemblies, the private use of them hath been condemned:</hi> Which brings to
my remembrance the Character, that the Reverend and Pious <hi>Bishop
Leighton,</hi> was wont to give of the Presbyterians, viz. <hi>That they made
themselves the Standard of opinions and practices, and never looked either
abroad into the world, to see what others were doing, nor yet back into the
former times, to observe what might be warranted or recommended by Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity;</hi>
and as by this means, they become singular in many things, so
in the point in hand, they differ from all other Churches in the World.
All the Reformed Churches abroad allow the use of the Lords Supper
to sick and dying persons, which they have peremptorily prohibited;
as there was nothing more ordinary in the Primitive times, which
might be made appear from several instances.</p>
            <p>It was from this practice, that it received the name of <hi>Viaticum;</hi>
and seeing our Blessed Lord did institute this Holy Sacrament, for the
commemorating his death, and for the conveying the blessed effects of
it, to strengthen our faith and hope, and to assure us of the pardon
of our Sins, and of a victory over Death and Hell, through our Lord
Jesus Christ: It may be truly thought great Cruelty, to deny this sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
consort to sick and dying persons; because they stand most in need
of it; for then it is they have the deepest sense of their sins, and the
greatest fears of Death and its consequences. The other reason given
by them for this prohibition, is <hi>that by allowing the private use of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:54716:7"/>
in pretended cases of necessity; the superstitious opinion is nourished,
that they are necessary to Salvation, not only as commanded duties; but as
means without which Salvation cannot be contained. Therefore the Assembly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges
the Administration of the Lords Supper to sick Persons in their Houses,
and all other use of the same, except in the publick Assemblies of the Church;
and also do discharge the Administration of Baptism in private; that is, in
any place, or at any time, when the Congregation is not orderly called toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to wait on the dispensing of the Word. In which</hi> we may take notice
of these particulars. First, that they deny the comfort and benefit of
Christ's own Ordinances to some, because others entertain wrong
notions of them, which may be more safely removed by publick and
private instruction. Secondly that they restrain the use of Christs
Ordinances, to times and places without any Divine warrant, for the
same; And yet Mr. <hi>Rule</hi> hath laid it down as a principal (Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the Presbyterian Government, page 2.) <hi>That Christ as head
of the Church hath given forth Laws, by which the affairs of the Church
should be managed; and hath not left any nomothetick power in the Church
to make Laws, for her self; her work being to declare and ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ute the Laws
of Christ:</hi> Thirdly that they have no regard to what our Lord says,
Math. 18. 20. <hi>Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there
will I be amongst them;</hi> otherwise they would not prohibit the private
Administration of the Sacraments in cases of necessity and great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency;
in which they use only to be desired; and even then they
were never wont to be administred, but in the presence of a greater
number than that our Saviour speaks of. Fourthly, this Act of theirs
about Baptism proceeds from a mistake of <hi>Math. 28. 19:</hi> as if thereby
<hi>Teaching or Preaching,</hi> were appointed to go before Baptizing; whereas
the word in the Original signifies not to <hi>Preach;</hi> but to <hi>make Disciples;</hi>
and if their sense were true, none ought to be Baptized, but such as
were first <hi>taught;</hi> and consequently Infants ought not to be Baptized
at all, because incapable of being <hi>taught.</hi> Fifthly we may gather hence,
their wrong notion of P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>eaching and dispensing the Word, as they
call it: For as Baptism was never used to be Administred, even in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,
among us in <hi>Scotland,</hi> without the Word, that is, without some
previous discourse of the nature of the Sacrament, of the Covenant of
Grace, of our Redemption through Jesus Christ, and other points per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
to that occasion, so their prohibiting the Administration of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,
without the <hi>Dispensing of the Word,</hi> (which is done with respect to
the practice of the Episcopal Clergy) clearly shews, that they do not
think the Gospel is preached, or the Word dispensed, but when one
takes a Text, divides it, raises Doctrines and Uses from it, and runs
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
               </gap> into <hi>Firstlys, Secondlys,</hi> and <hi>Thirdlys,</hi> until they come to <hi>Twelf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>hly</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:54716:7"/>
and <hi>Twentiethly beloved.</hi> Finally tho the stream of this <hi>Act</hi> runs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
               </gap>
as if the Sacraments could not in any case be lawfully or duly Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred
in private, yet in the conclusion it is said that <hi>this be carefully ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
when and wherever, the Lord giveth his people peace, liberty, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
for their publick Assemblies;</hi> which is added, to prevent the cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their own practices in their Teeth, and to justifie their private Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministrations,
if they shall happen to be reduced to the state, in which
they were before this Revolution; for they are pretty dextrous at bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and loosing themselves. And it is further to be observed, that when
they want peace and liberty, it is happier for their Children; for then
they may have the benefit of Baptism in any place and at any time;
whereas now they suffer them to die without it, unless they can wait
their leisure in the <hi>publick Assemblies,</hi> which falls out but once a week,
except it be in some Cities.</p>
            <p>I must not let pass, how they have recorded the dissolving of <hi>the
Assembly,</hi> and the appointing of another. As was said in the former
relation, both these were done by the <hi>Commissioner</hi> in the Kings name, to
which at the time they submitted; but yet they intended so to record
it, as if the same had been done by the simple Authority of the <hi>Assembly</hi>
it self; for they had it thus. <hi>This Assembly thought fit to dissolve it self, and
to call another;</hi> which when it was read, the Commissioner found fault
with it, and desired, that it might be said, that he in his Majesties name
had done it, to whom the Moderator replyed, <hi>Your Grace needs not
be offended; these things are but words, and we will not stand upon them:</hi>
But the Commissioner pressing a change of the first form; they have
at last worded it thus. <hi>This Assembly being dissolved, and the next general
Assembly appointed to be held at</hi> Edinburgh <hi>the first day of</hi> November <hi>next</hi> to
come, the Members were dismissed with Prayer, neither did this please
the Commissioner, but they would not make any express mention of
the <hi>Kings Authority</hi> or of the <hi>Commissioner</hi> representing him, lest it should
prove an ill president. They were careful to leave nothing upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
that might make against the Soveraign Supremacy, which they
claim.</p>
            <p>This being all that is needful to be added to the former <hi>Relation of
the General Assembly,</hi> I therefore proceed to give an Account of what
has passed since, and to shew the effects and consequences of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
laid down in the <hi>Assembly</hi> for the establishing and securing the
Presbyterian Government.</p>
            <p>To keep the order of Time; the first thing to be taken notice of, is
the <hi>Synod of Lothian and Twedal,</hi> which sate down at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> on
<hi>Tuesday</hi> the second of <hi>December,</hi> Mr. <hi>Areskin,</hi> who preached in the
<hi>Trone Church of Edinburgh,</hi> was chosen Moderator of it; in that Synod
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:54716:8"/>
there was an early proof, that either moderation was not seriously re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
by the <hi>Assembly,</hi> to the particular <hi>Synods and Presbyteries,</hi>
or that they had no disposition to obey: For Mr. <hi>Alexander Heriot
Minister of Dalkeith,</hi> being referred to this <hi>Synod</hi> by the <hi>general As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly,</hi>
they were so far from redressing him, that instead of
relaxing him from the sentence of suspension, pronounced by the
<hi>Presbytery of Dalkeith;</hi> they added to it the <hi>Sentence of Deposition</hi>
and <hi>deprivation.</hi> They concluded the affair without calling upon him,
or hearing his defences, and his first appearance was to hear himself
deposed after the formality of reading his <hi>Libel</hi> or <hi>Indictment.</hi> Mr.
<hi>Heriot</hi> was much surprised with this method and manner of proceeding,
and complained of it: He told them, there was nothing more unjust
than to condemn a man unheard, to let his <hi>Parties</hi> and <hi>Enemies</hi> (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Presbytery of <hi>Dalkeith,</hi> and particularly Mr. <hi>Calderwood</hi> there)
sit his Judges, and to refuse him the liberty of vindicating himself, and
of clearing his innocence; he shewed them, that the <hi>Libel or Indictment,</hi>
upon which they were going to pronounce Sentence, differed from that
which was given to himself, which was not fair dealing; that a double
of the particulars, which were added, should have been delivered to
him, and time allowed him to answer them; but all these things avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
nothing; for they were resolved to have him out <hi>per fas &amp; nefas:</hi>
but having told them, that as the only gross thing laid to his charge
was <hi>the dancing about Bonfires,</hi> October, 14<hi>th.</hi> 1688. So it was evident,
that he was charged with this falsly and maliciously; and that if any
had sworn it, they were perjured; for the 14<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>October</hi> in the Year
1688, happned to be a <hi>Lords Day,</hi> on which there never were any
<hi>Bonfires,</hi> upon the hearing of this the <hi>Synod</hi> was surprised, and kept silence
for a while, and sta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ed one upon another in the face; but at last Mr.
<hi>Areskin</hi> the Moderator answered, that the <hi>thing had been proven by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of witness; that if there was any errour or mistake, it lay at the
witnesses door, and if they had Sworn falsly, let them, said he, look to that,
we are not to blame for it; you may seek reparation from them:</hi> But in the
me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>n time they refused to tell him, who the witnesses were, that he
might prosecute them; Yet the starting of this made them delay the
depriving him at that time, until they should try, whether he would
willingly dimit his charge; and for that end they appointed some of
their number, both <hi>Laicks</hi> and <hi>Ministers,</hi> to wait upon him and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
with him. They told him that the Church of <hi>Dalkeith</hi> was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous
place, and the <hi>Presbytery seat;</hi> and therefore they could not
suffer it to be in the possession of one of his Circumstances, that is,
of one who had served under Episcopacy; but if he would dimit, they
would pass from the libel and recommend him to some other <hi>vacant
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:54716:8"/>
Church,</hi> which he peremptorily refused, because he thought a voluntary
dimission seemed to infer an acknowledgement of the guilt; therefore
the next day they overcame all difficulties, and formally deposed him,
thereby shewing, that they would commit the greatest injustice, and
betray the g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ossest partiality, rather than not obtain what they would
be at. And therefore in respect to Justice and Equity, all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of that <hi>Synod,</hi> who consented to the <hi>Sentence of Deposition</hi> against
Mr. <hi>Heriot,</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ght to be exauctorated and declared for ever inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable,
and ought to have some <hi>Stigma</hi> of Infamy fixt upon them.
This one instance might make the whole party bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of blushing at any thing: But as the <hi>Scots</hi> Proverb is, <hi>Shame is
passed the shed of their hair.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> being so much injured, by this <hi>Synod;</hi> appealed from it,
to the first Lawful <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Supremacy</hi> abolished in <hi>Parliament,</hi> which
was not rashly to be attempted; wherefore all that the <hi>Council did</hi>
for him, was to pass an <hi>Act for delivering up the Depositions of the witnesses,
and for recognizing the affair in the next Synod;</hi> neither of which has yet
been done: Both the <hi>witnesses names and their Depositions</hi> are still concealed
and kept up from Mr. <hi>Heriot.</hi> And as if he had been justly and legally
deposed, they have proceeded to plant another, in the <hi>Church of Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keith,</hi>
notwithstanding both he himself, and almost all the <hi>Heritors</hi> and
<hi>Parishoners</hi> protested against it. Some of the <hi>Heriters</hi> and <hi>Parishoners</hi>
in name of the rest, went to the <hi>Presbytery,</hi> and desired them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
that Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi>'s affair was still depending, and his <hi>Appeal</hi> not
discussed, so that they could not admit of another Minister, and as
they thought themselves obliged to own Mr. <hi>Heriot,</hi> as their <hi>Lawful
Pastor,</hi> whom they knew to be innocent and greatly injured; so
they objected against Mr. <hi>Mean</hi> (so the old Man is called, whom
they have put into the <hi>Church of Dalkeith</hi>) and shewed that he had
not the <hi>call</hi> and <hi>consent</hi> of the people; for they had almost all of them
declared against him; and to prove this, they produced <hi>a Paper</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their hand to this purpose. After this they went to Mr. <hi>Mean</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and repeated the same to him, who answered, <hi>that their prejudice
against him was groundless, that he was misrepresented as a very severe and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54716:9"/>
rigid man, but he would prove otherwise; for such as came and heard him,
should be welcome, and they who did withdraw should be let alone, and
have their Liberty to go whither they pleased:</hi> So to facilitate his entry,
he gave smooth words, and dissembled both his own temper, and the
Spirit and Genius of his party. But tho his discourse shewed, that he
desired to be settled at <hi>Dalkeith,</hi> upon any terms and conditions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it was a good and convenient <hi>Living,</hi> yet at his <hi>admission,</hi> he
professed publickly, a great reluctancy and aversion to it, and that it
was meer constraint that made him accept of the Charge. This was
so gross, that several who were present, could not hear it with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
but at the very time exclaimed, and charged him with Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence,
Hypocrisie, and mocking of God; for it was well known,
that he had for a long time a great desire to that place, and himself
knew, that he got it against the <hi>Will and Inclinations of the people</hi> (a very
few excepted). If this be not Intrusion, I know not what may be
called so.</p>
            <p>The next thing which falls under our consideration, is the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the <hi>Fast,</hi> appointed by the <hi>Assembly;</hi> the <hi>Act</hi> and <hi>Reasons</hi>
for this, which was enjoined to be read by all the Ministers in <hi>Kirks</hi>
and <hi>Meeting-Houses,</hi> and the <hi>Civil Sanction</hi> enforcing it, were
published with the <hi>Historical Relation of the General Assembly.</hi> This
<hi>Fast</hi> was long and much discoursed of before the day of keeping
it. They who smell Political Designs, in all the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Fasts,
said, That the intent of it was not to pay Devotion to God, or to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliate
his favour, by a general Humiliation, throughout the Kingdom,
as was pretended, but that it was a Contrivance to ruine the Interest
of the <hi>Episcopal Clergy,</hi> that those who should observe it, might be
look'd upon as men of no Conscience, and that whosoever should slight
it, might become obnoxious to the censure of the Government. A
Gentleman told me, that some time before the sitting of the Assembly,
he and some others were pleading for the Minister of that Parish,
whom they designed to turn out, and that when the <hi>Presbyterian Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,</hi>
and Lay-Elders (among whom there was a present <hi>Lord of
Session</hi>) were deliberating what answer to give, he over-heard one say,
<hi>We may grant the Gentlemen their request at this time, for the Assembly is to
sit shortly, in which there will be an Act made, which will turn out all the
Curates very easily.</hi> The Gentleman, at the time, could not understand
of what nature that would be, but afterwards, when the <hi>Fast</hi> was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned,
he concluded, that was it which was designed to give so severe
and universal a blow to the Episcopal Clergy. It is certain, that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of this nature was designed from the beginning, for as they were
resolved not to admit any Episcopal Minister into Communion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:54716:9"/>
some acknowledgment; so understanding, that enjoyning every
one to do Pennance in particular, for his defection from the Covenant,
and complying with Prelacy, would be obstructed, therefore they
thought a general Humiliation would be a fitter expedient, which was
Equivalent upon the matter. Whosoever had read and considered
<hi>Mr. Rule</hi>'s <hi>Representation of Presbyterian Government,</hi> might have foreseen
this, for in his answer to that objection (which is the seventh) <hi>That if
Presbyterians got power, they would force all to make publick Repentance
who have owned Bishops, taken the Test, or other Oaths which they dislike.</hi>
He saith, <hi>our principle is, That publick Scandals ought to be publickly rebuk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
yet there are Cases, in which the strictness of Discipline, in this matter,
may, and must be relaxed: As first, When the matter of offence is contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
and the sinful practise is from the mis-information of the Conscience.
And secondly, When the fault is Universal, and either the w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ole, or the
greater part of the Church is Guilty,</hi> and so he concludeth, <hi>that a general
Humiliation of the whole Church, may be instead of particular application of
Censures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Presbyterians gave out, that this <hi>Fast</hi> was a Reconciling thing,
and that whosoever duly observed it, would be taken in upon very easi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>
terms; but the Episcopal Clergy were mightily offended with it, and
nothing gravelled them more than the <hi>Civil Sanction,</hi> for they would
not have much regarded the <hi>Act of the Assembly,</hi> if that had not been
added to it, but seeing that was added, they were puzled how to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
themselves from a contempt of the Civil Government, if they
did not keep the <hi>Fast,</hi> as they found it difficult to keep up their Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
among the people, with the observation of it, for the people
were no less disgusted with it than the Clergy, looking upon it as an
Unchristian Act, to impose such a task upon the Ministers of the Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal
Perswasion; and on all occasions they plainly said, that none
but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ordid Compliers would observe it, for, in truth, the <hi>Presbyterian
Fasts</hi> are not so taking now, as they were formerly in the <hi>reign of the
Covenant,</hi> for it is observed, that <hi>Mountebanks never thrive so well the
second time they set up, in any place, as the first.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This time there were several Papers emitted, containing reasons why
the Episcopal Clergy would not observe that <hi>Fast,</hi> 
               <q>because they could
not own the Authority of the Assembly that enjoyned it, as a Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Representative of this Church; that by the Laws of God and the
Church, the Ministers of the Presbyterian Perswasion had no right
to impose Commands upon those of the Episcopal, seeing the essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Constitution of their Government, which is Parity, gives them no
Jurisdiction over the Brethren; and consequently, their Acts cannot
bind them without their Consent, which cannot be p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>etended to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:54716:10"/>
here, seeing they had no Delegates, or Representatives in the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.
It was again argued, that the <hi>Reasons</hi> of the <hi>Fast</hi> were very
ambiguous, and not easily understood; that if by the <hi>general De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi>
and <hi>taking of unlawful Oaths,</hi> they meant the compliance
with Prelac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>, and <hi>swearing Allegiance, and the Test,</hi> the Episcopal
Clergy could not profess Repentance and Humiliation for these,
without a horrid Profanation of the Name of God, while in their
Consciences they were not convinced of the unlawfulness of these
Compliances, and that it shewed the little regard the Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
had for the Sacred Offices of Religion, to enjoin their obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
of this, when they knew what their Judgment and Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
were, as to these things.</q> But amongst all the papers which
came abroad on that occasion, there was none more diverting than
the <hi>Burlesque Poem</hi> on the <hi>Fast,</hi> which one witily called the <hi>Present
State of Scotland,</hi> for it not only gave a lively Picture of the Presbyterian
party, but also it wittily represented the Humours and Characters of
the <hi>several parties</hi> within the Kingdom, and of many <hi>particular persons,</hi>
so that even those concerned, thought their Neighbours part was well
done; however, displeased they might be with their own.</p>
            <p>When the time of observing the <hi>Fast</hi> drew near, the <hi>Clergy of the
Diocess of Aberdeen,</hi> took occasion to communicate their thoughts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and found themselves obliged, both in Conscience and Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
not to observe it: Those of <hi>Angus, Perth,</hi> and some other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
followed their Measure;, so that it was kept by very few in the
<hi>Northern parts.</hi> The Episcopal Clergy in the <hi>South,</hi> had not such op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of meeting, and therefore were not so unanimous, either
in their Sentiments or Practises. Some few made no scruple, either
of keeping the Fast, or of reading the <hi>Assemblie's Reasons</hi> for it. Some
others kept the <hi>Fast,</hi> but would not read the Paper appointed by the
<hi>General Assembly,</hi> and what perswaded them to this, was a Report that
the Court had given Assurance, that they who observed the Day
should not suffer, tho they had no regard either to the <hi>Authority</hi> or
<hi>Reasons,</hi> of the <hi>General Assembly.</hi> And to make this the more probable,
there was a Paper handed about amongst them, concerted and agreed
to (as was said) at <hi>London,</hi> by some Bishops and others there, to be
read instead of that appointed by the Assembly; I shall set it down,

so they read the <hi>Assemblies Paper,</hi> and Commented upon it, and by
an excess of Charity, made the <hi>Assembly</hi> speak what they ought to have
done, rather than what they actually did. The Ministers of <hi>East
Lothian,</hi> and, I suppose, some from the <hi>Mers,</hi> met at <hi>Haddington,</hi>
the Week before the <hi>Fast,</hi> to take joynt measures for the observation of
it: It was soon agreed to, That they could neither in Reputation
nor Conscience observe it, as it was enjoyned by the <hi>Assembly,</hi> and
therefore it was first resolved to do it with a <hi>Protestation;</hi> accordingly
the following <hi>Protestation</hi> was Composed, which each of them was to
take a Copy of, and to read it from the Pulpit, both on <hi>Sunday,</hi> at
the Intimation of the <hi>Fast,</hi> and on <hi>Thursday,</hi> the Eighth of <hi>Ianuary,</hi>

in it.</head>
                        <p>WHereas Their Majesties most Honourable Privy Council, by
their Act and Proclamation, of the date <hi>November</hi> 21â€”90,
hath ratified and approven an Act of the General Assembly, of the
date <hi>November</hi> 12. that same year, appointing a Solemn National
Fast and Humiliation to be observed in all the Churches and Meeting-Houses
within this Kingdom, the 2d. <hi>Thursday</hi> of this Instant. We
declare, That we judge our selves obliged to give obedience to the
foresaid Act of Council, in so far as that is consistent with good
Conscience, and the Duty we owe to God and his Truth; and that
we are most desirous to joyn with all others within this Nation, in
the publick and solemn Confession of our Sins, deprecating the
Wrath of God, and supplicating for his Mercy, and in all the other
Pious and Religious Exercises, proper for that Day of Humiliation
and Fasting. But being that there are several Causes and Reasons
expressed and specified in the said Act of the General Assembly,
which do manifestly contradict our Principles and Opinions, and
some things affirmed and asserted, irreconcileable to Truth and
Charity, and other Christian Duties; and lest our observance of that
Fast, should be Interpreted the Homologating of these, or a sordid
or deceitful Compliance against our Consciences, we judge our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:54716:12"/>
bound to declare, as hereby we do declare, That we intimate
and publish this Fast, and will observe it, for these Reasons and
Causes only that are consistent with our Opinions, which we have
owned by Solemn Oaths, and with the Charity, and other Duties,
incumbent on us, by the Laws of the Gospel; and do renounce all
Grounds, Reasons and Causes, contrary unto, or inconsistent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with:
And in particular, We do protest</p>
                        <p>1. That by keeping of this Fast, we do not own or acknowledge,
the Power and Authority that the foresaid Assembly does arrogate
over us, in so far as that is contrary to the Word of God, and never
heard of in the Christian Church before this time, to wit, That
Presbyters should have a power of Government and Jurisdiction over
other Presbyters, who are of the same Office and Degree.</p>
                        <p>2. We do protest, that we do not approve of these Words, <hi>That the
Supremacy was advanced in such a way, and to such a height, as never
any Christian Church acknowledged,</hi> being we know, and are ready
to prove, that they are false, and being, tho the Supremacy is taken
away by the Law, as unsuitable to the present circumstances of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs;
yet it is not declared a sinful Prerogative of the Crown, neither
do we esteem it as such.</p>
                        <p>3. We do protest, That we do not own or assent unto that Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the Fast, <hi>That the Government of the Church was altered, and
Prelucy, which hath always been grievous to this Nation, introduced
without the Churches consent, and contrary to the standing Acts of our
National Assemblies,</hi> &amp;c. being we certainly know, that Episcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
was never more grievous to the Nation than Presbytery, and
that it was settled with the Churches consent, in free General Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,
after the Reformation, and was afterward received and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to, by the Church, in free Meetings and Assemblies: And,
in particular, we do assert, That the Assembly held at <hi>Glasgow</hi> 1610.
which established and settled Episcopacy, was as lawfully Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated,
and of as undoubted Authority, as the Assembly held at <hi>Glas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gow</hi>
1638. which turned it out; as also that Episcopacy was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
by a lawful Parliament, <hi>An.</hi> 1661. and approved by the subse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
actings of the Church, in so far as that was necessary, in referenc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Assemblies of more unquestionable Authority, than any that had
Abolished the same.</p>
                        <p>4. We do protest, that we do not approve of these Words, <hi>That
Prelacy was introduced contrary to the standing Acts of our National As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies,</hi>
being it doth imply, that the King and Parliament canno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to give an Absolute and Uncontroulable power to Church men,
and is inconsistent with the undoubted Right and Power the State
hath for reforming Abuses in the Administration of Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
and Discipline, and disposing of that as may best serve the
ends of Religion, and the peace of the Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>5. We do protest, that we do not approve of these Words: <hi>An<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

suddenly and readily comply with that alteration of the Government, some
out of Pride and Covetousness, or Men pleasing, some through Infirmity
and Weakness, or fear of Man, and want of Courage and Zeal for
God, many faithful Ministers were thereupon cast out, and many insuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
and scandalous thrust into in their Charges, &amp;c.</hi> for these do necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
imply the Divine Right of Presbyterian Government, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>no
Humane Authority can alter it, and that submission unto, or com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pliance
with any other is sinful; and that submission to Episcopacy
restored, <hi>An.</hi> 1662. did proceed from vitious Causes; as also they
do imply an uncharitable Censure of many faithful Ministers, as
Men pleasers, wanting Courage and Zeal for God, and the like,
which we think very opposite to the temper and disposition where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
the Duties of Fasting and Humiliation should be performed.</p>
                        <p>6. We do protest that we do not approve of these Words, <hi>That
there hath been under the late Prelacy a great decay of Piety, so that it
was enough to make a man be Nick named a Phanatick, if he did not run
to the same excess of Riot with others;</hi> for tho we do grant there hath
been much Impiety under the late Prelacy, and do mourn for it,
yet we do affirm, That it abounded as much under Presbytery,
and it is not agreeable to the sincerity of our Confessions, on a
Day of Solemn Humiliation, or at any time, to be partial in the
Rehearsal of our Sins, or to distinguish our selves from others,
as if we were more Righteous, and to confine Religion and Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to a Party.</p>
                        <p>7. We do protest, that we do not approve of that <hi>Reason of the Fast,
That the Nation hath been guilty of breaking their Oaths, and imposing
and taking ungodly and unlawful Oaths and Bonds, &amp;c.</hi> in so far as
these may signifie the <hi>Oaths of Allegiance, Supremacy,</hi> and the <hi>Test,</hi>
which <hi>Oaths,</hi> as we Swore in Judgment, Righteousness, and Truth,
so we do still acknowledge the equity and obligation of them.</p>
                        <p>8. We cannot approve of <hi>that Reason of the Fast, The wonted
Care and Religious Sanctifying of the Lords Day is gone, &amp;c.</hi> And of
that Petition we are required to send up unto God, <hi>that the preaching
of the Word, and dispencing of the Sacraments, may be accompanied with
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:54716:13"/>
the wonted presence, power, and blessing of the Spirit of the Lord:</hi> in so
far as they may imply, that the power of the Word and Sacraments
is restrained and true Godliness decayed under Episcopacy, and that
they abounded under Presbytery; which is to make the Life of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
depend upon Opinions and outward Forms of Government, or
to have the persons of men in admiration, and favours of that Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
and pha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>â€¢</desc>
                           </gap>isaical pride, which will render all our solemn humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
hateful to God.</p>
                        <p>9. We do protest, that these words, <hi>We have sinned notwithstanding
of Promises and solemn Vowing and Covenanting with God to the contrary,</hi>
are not understood by us with any reference to the <hi>Solemn League and
Covenant,</hi> which some do apprehend to be the meaning of the <hi>General
Assembly.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>All these and the like Reasons and Causes of the <hi>Fast,</hi> tho not here
exprest, that are inconsistent with our declared opinions are renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
and disowned by us. And we do protest, that our observance
of this <hi>Fast</hi> shall not be interpreted as the approving and homologa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
any of these; And we do desire and intreat all that are of the
same Principles with us, as they will avoid the Sin of Hypocrisie
and mocking of God, and would be accepted of him, that they
carefully separate betwixt these grounds and reasons of the <hi>Fast,</hi> that
are agreeable to, and these that are contrary to their duty and good
Conscience, and that they joyn with us in this our Protestation,
openly owning and declaring their Judgment anent the same: We
do also earnestly exhort all, in the love and fear of God, that laying
aside all prejudices, malice, uncharitableness, and indiscreet and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
zeal, lying, and slandering; that they may unite together in
confessing the Sins they are guilty of; and humble themselves in
the sight of God, for their Sins, and the Sins of their Fore fathers,
without any partial respect to the opinion, that hath occasioned some
divisions and differences in present and former times; and that they
send up their fervent prayers to Almighty God, that he would be
pleased to bestow, of his Grace and Spirit upon all Orders and Ranks
of People, that they may live as becomes the Gospel, and shew forth
the praises of him, who has called them from darkness to his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous
light; and in particular that they would pray, that it may
please our most merciful Father, to inspire all the Members of his
Church, with the meek and loving Spirit of our blessed Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
Jesus Christ, and that every one may seek after these things
that make for peace, and whereby they may edifie one another; that
there may be a mutual forbearance of one another, as to the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
anent the Government of the Church, which hath occasioned so
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:54716:14"/>
much disquiet and disorder to this Church and Kingdom; and that
none be forced or tempted to declare or do against their Consciences,
and that amidst the differences of opinions, there may be a chearful
concurrence, in all things that have a respect unto the glory of God,
and the advancement of true Godliness.</p>
                        <p>Finally we do exhort all (as we our selves do resolve by Divine
Assistance) religiously and devoutly to observe the <hi>Fast</hi> for all these
ends and purposes, and in the manner specified in the <hi>Act of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Assembly,</hi> in so far as that is consistent with this our Protestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and is allowable by the Laws of the Gospel.</p>

            <p>But upon second thoughts, it was concluded, that the <hi>Protestation</hi>
might give greater offence than the total neglect of the <hi>Fast,</hi> and so at
last it was agreed, that none should observe the <hi>Fast</hi> in any wise. But
one Mr. <hi>D.</hi> who was not present, being advised, that it was safest to
make some observation of it, that he might not be singular, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
with the <hi>Minister of Haddington,</hi> and one or two more, to break
off from that general resolution, and to keep the <hi>Fast</hi> with him.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Edinburgh</hi> it was only observed by Mr. <hi>Wilkie</hi> in the <hi>Tolbooth,</hi> and
Mr. <hi>Craig</hi> in the <hi>Lady Yesters Church:</hi> But no mans Behaviour in this
affair was so worthy to be remarked, as that of the Reverend Mr. <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
heretofore Professor of Divinity in the Colledge of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and
at present Minister of <hi>Dirleton.</hi> All who have any acquaintance with
him, know that he is a person both of great learning and piety, whose
Charity prompted him to think all the good of every one that can be
reasonably conceived. He was convinced, that there were too many
reasons and causes, which called for fasting, mourning, and humiliation,
but as he well knew the practices of Presbyterians in former times, so it
seemed evident to him, that at this time they were endeavouring to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
on their own Selfish ends under the colour of Religion and had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
this <hi>Fast</hi> to be a snare, whereby the weak and ignorant might be
drawn unawares to own and acknowledge their false and narrow prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
and which might afford a fair opportunity of inflicting <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
Censures</hi> and <hi>other punishments</hi> upon others who would not so
sordidly desert their Principles, nor debase their former Character and
Profession. He had such an impression of this base dealing, of the
scandal and prejudice, which Religion suffered by it; and of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
which threatened the best part of the Church, that he thought
every one obliged to testifie against this <hi>Act of the Assembly,</hi> and to do
all he could to prevent the peoples being deceived. And because a
bare forbearing a <hi>Fast</hi> in his judgment was not a sufficient <hi>Remonstrance,</hi>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

to this purpose.</p>
            <q>
               <p>Ye have heard the causes of the <hi>Fast,</hi> as they are represented by
<hi>the General Assembly;</hi> they have recommended it to Pastors and others
to be serious and sincere in the Confession and acknowledgment of
their own and the Nations transgresions, and to be earnest in the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>

Supplications for such favours from God, as the present condition
and circumstances, in which this and other Reformed Churches are,
do call for. I hope after the hearing of so long a Paper, you will
have a little further patience, while I sincerely represent to you some<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>things
concerning the sins we are to confess, and the mercies for
which we are to supplicate. All who are wise and have a right sense
of true Religion and Christianity, cannot but see, that there hath
been a great defection amongst us.</p>
               <p>This defection hath not been from the truth, or from the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Articles of the Christian Faith, but from the life of God
and the power of Religion, and from that temper and conversation,
which the Gospel requires in us, so that I doubt not but we and all
good men will joyn with the <hi>Assembly,</hi> in acknowledging the sins
and defection of the Nation.</p>
               <p>But whereas the <hi>Assembly</hi> seems to represent <hi>Episcopacy</hi> as a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
and capital point of the <hi>defection,</hi> and as introductory into further
degrees of Corruption; I find my self obliged to declare my sense in
this affair upon this ocasion. I do not take my self to be bound to
endeavour to justifie the manner of the introduction of Episcopacy
into this Church <hi>An.</hi> 1662. nor the manner of Election and nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of persons to that Office, which was in use among us, nor the
legal Establishment, nor the Laws, by which it was established among
us, nor the conduct of those who were in Office; and I will not say
but some who were in the Office of Episcopacy and that complied
with that Government, might have been in some measure accessary
to the corruptions, by their bad example or Connivance, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
of the true Exercise of Discipline. But yet I cannot think that
the settling of an <hi>Imparity</hi> of the Officers of the Church, is to be looked
upon as a <hi>defection,</hi> or that it is a thing in it self unlawful, or that it
is of it self introductory of the abounding of wickedness and scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals
in the Church. This I may with the greatest confidence affirm,
that Religion never flourished more in the World, than it did when
and where there was an <hi>Imparity</hi> among the <hi>Officers</hi> of the Church
And this I know, that some famous <hi>Protestant Churches,</hi> do allow
<hi>Episcopacy,</hi> and continue till this day under that <hi>form</hi> of <hi>Government;</hi>
and I am sure that most of the Wise, Pious, and Learned men abroad,
tho they live where the Goverment is not Episcopal, have not such
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:54716:15"/>
bad thoughts of it as our Brethren here have. And whereas they
charge many of the then standing Ministry with compliance with
the alteration of the Government. I do not see that the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of Pastors to serve God and the Church under the late settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
is to be look'd upon as a defection, for which they are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent;
divers of them having continued to serve in the Ministry,
neither out of Pride, nor Covetousness, or Fear, or Weakness, or
want of Courage, but out of Conscience, and a fear to offend
God, by refvsing their service in that station, when there was no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>superable
stop, or bar put in their way, as they thought there then
was not. And the like may be said of many others, who entred
afterwards into the Pastoral Office, under the the late Government.
But notwithstanding of what we have said of this matter, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but acknowledge, that there has been a great defection among
us. Men generally have shaken off the Yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>e of Christ; and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest
none of that respect, which we all owe to his Laws, and
have abandoned themselves to their Lusts, and corrupt inclinations,
so that iniquities and Immoralities of all sorts have abounded, and
generally men of all ranks have corrupted their ways. Covetousness,
Fraud, Oppression, Injustice, Sensuality, Drunkenness, and divers
kinds of uncleannesses, Cursing, Swearing, Atheism, neglect of the
worship of God, and other Sins, besides these reckoned in this Paper
have abounded. The <hi>Assembly</hi> acknowledges, that there have been
some disorders, among those of their perswasion: Which, they say
is matter of humiliation, such as, scandalous divisions, injurious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
against worthy men, and some dangerous principles drunk
in. They say, it should be lamented, <hi>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>

the main things did endeavour to maintain their Integrity, did not give sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable

and did not keep a d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

I know not what else can be understood by it) that it is to be lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that some of their way did not separate from such as complied
with the Government, but did joyn in worship with them: This
will not appear to any others, besides some of themselves, to be
matter of Lamentation. It is rather matter of Lamentation, that
so many of them did behave themselves so schismati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

cruel actions, which have been so much the more scandalouss as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
acted under colour and pretence of Religion. These and such
like should be confessed ingennously, and mourned for: And O
that it might please God to make us all sensible how far we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
from that Spirit, and temper, and that behaviour and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,
which the Gospel requires in us, and to dispose us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
and amend.</p>
               <p>As to those things for which we are desired to pray, we have all
reason heartily to joyn with them. There is only one expression
which I have observed, in which I fear they mean, something for
which I cannot joyn in Prayer with them. The expression is,
<hi>Tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap> all the Lords people may be of one mind in the Lord;</hi> if they mean
by it as they should do, that they may all agree in the fundamentals
of Religion, and may with one mind and one mouth glorifie God,
and may live in Love, Peace and Concord together; and joyntly
pursue the attainment of everlasting Life: It is a very fit Petition,
and we are all earnestly to pray for it. But if they mean, we are
to pray <hi>that all may have the like sentiments with themselves, about
the Government of the Church, and may consider Presbyterran Government
to be of such concern and importance, as themselves take it to be;</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
joyn with them in it. That opinion being the source of most
of the distractions, which abound among us, and depriving them
who hold it, of what they owe to all, who hold the fundamentals of
the Christian Faith, and walk agreeable to the Laws of the Gospel. It
incapacitates them who hold it for performing all Offices of Love,
to these, who are not of their perswasion, and prompts them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:54716:16"/>
themselves towards all such as Enemies to God and Religion;
it makes them look with an evil eye upon these Protestant Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
which have not such a model of Government, and begets in
them, a neglect, dislike, and aversion from these Churches.</p>
               <p>I use not to speak so much of these things in such an auditory, nor
had I now spoken of them, if we had been so discreetly dealt with
as not to be driven to it. <hi>This was said on</hi> Sunday. <hi>On</hi> Thursday,
<hi>which was the Fast day, he added as follows,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This day is set a part for Fasting, and humbling our selves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Sense of our Sins, and the Sins of the Church, and Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
of which we are Members, and to deprecate the wrath and
heavy judgments, which our sins deserve, and to beg mercy from
God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And indeed it is evident that we are all highly guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
before God, and have grievously provoked him to wrath, and
indignation against us; we have disobeyed and despised the
Gospel, and almost Universally under the Profession of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion, have lived as Heathens; and whereas the Gospel
teaches us to live Righteously, Godlily and Soberly; Unrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Ungodliness, Uncharitableness, and Intemperance have aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
among us, it is fit, that we confess these things with grief and
sorrow. The <hi>Assembly</hi> in that Paper which was read to you the
other day, tho they lay open the sins of others, yet are too spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
in confessing these of their own way. They say among
other things, that <hi>Episcopacy was introduced, many faithful Ministers
were cast out, and insufficient and scandalous men thrust in on their
Charges;</hi> but there was not a word in all the Paper of not a few
faithful Pastors cast out by some of their way, in a disorderly and
tumultuous manner, they being private persons and without Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.
I wish the vacancies they have made may not be supplied
by scandalous persons, or such as are weak and insufficient, and
destitute of a right sense and understanding of Religion.</p>
            </q>
            <p>This much may suffice of the behaviour of <hi>Episcopal men;</hi> as to
the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> thems<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>lves, to be sure, they kept the <hi>Fast</hi> with a
great deal of fervour and zeal; but as if it had been only appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for confessing the <hi>errours</hi> of <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> and the <hi>Sins</hi> of <hi>Episcopal
men:</hi> They spent the whole day upon this: Their Sermons and
Prayers were nothing else, but so many invectives against the Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal
Clergy, and the former Reigns, which was done partly to
satisfie their Revenge, because they could do no more at present;
and partly to enflame the peoples rage; and to render them more
keen upon their destruction. Only Mr. <hi>Wilkie</hi> in the Meeting house
of the <hi>Canon-gate,</hi> thought he would be too partial, if he should
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:54716:16"/>
only reckon up the Sins of others; wherefore in the <hi>Afternoon,</hi> he
resolved to confess his <hi>own sins</hi> and the <hi>sins of his Party,</hi> and so
he instanced among other Peccadillos, their <hi>taking an Indulgence
from a Popish King, which was only granted to make way for Popish
Priests and Iesuits, who sought the ruine of the Protestant Religion:</hi> 
               <q>We
knew this, said he, well enough; but self interest byassed us: and
the same principal of self interest made us guilty of sinful silence;
for all that time, we never Preached against Popery, fearing that
we might lose that Liberty, if we did. And none said he, was
more guilty than my self; for <hi>Mass</hi> was said daily at my <hi>Lugg,</hi>
and yet I never opened my mouth.</q> Indeed these men were very
cautious then, and careful to abstain from every thing, that might
be supposed to give the least offence; by which, they shewed
that they had their Tongues under great command; for before
they were wholly addicted to railing against Popery, and every
thing, which they fancied to be like it. Yet they could tie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
up instantly, when they apprehended it might do them hurt.
This cautiousness was very observeable, one day in Mr. <hi>Geo. Iohnson,</hi>
who Preached in the same Meeting-House of the <hi>Cannongate.</hi> He had
in his Prayers unwares, contrary to the concerted measures, let
fall these words, <hi>O Lord confound the Land of Graven Images,</hi> which
no sooner passed from him, than he instantly checked himself,
and with the same breath, cryed out, <hi>But O God save our King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus I have given a full account of the <hi>Fast,</hi> which occasioned
as great variety of sentiments and practices, as any one thing that
ever was enjoyned.</p>
            <p>It is evident, that from the beginning of this Revolution, the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians
have had the turning out of the Episcopal Clergy wholly
in their Head, at least, more than any other thing: Revenge, as
as well as Interest and Security, prompted them to this, for they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
it hard, if not impossible, to preserve the Interest and Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their great <hi>Diana Presbytery,</hi> or to oblige people to a Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Worshipping of this <hi>Goddess,</hi> by which they have their Wealth,
while there were so many, who thought and taught, that there was
no <hi>Divinity</hi> in it; and consequently, both their <hi>Craft</hi> would be in
danger to be set at nought, and their <hi>Diana</hi> should be despised, if
these men were not removed from amongst them. And to compass
this, they tryed various methods: First, as <hi>Demetrius</hi> raised an uproar
in <hi>Ephesus,</hi> against St. <hi>Paul,</hi> so they began with a <hi>Rabble</hi> in the <hi>West<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
               </hi>
and some places of the <hi>Southern Borders,</hi> in which they succeeded ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their mind; for, in a short space of time, they emptied
all these Churches to the number of about three or four hundred.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:54716:17"/>
But this method was only proper for these places, where the ignorant
Bigots, and Partisans of Presbytery are, it could not be attempted
in other parts of the Kingdom, where the people were better In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed,
not so rude and barbarous, and who generally were very
well pleased with the Ministers of the Episcopal Perswasion, whom
they preferred every way, and in all things, to the Presbyterian
Preachers. If it were narrowly examined, it would be found, that
even this method, in the <hi>West,</hi> is no demonstration of a total aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
in the people there, to the Episcopal Clergy, as it was given
out to be; for there was not a General Insurrection of the Parishes of
that Country, but a certain <hi>Rabble</hi> combined together, and run up
and down, thrusting out Ministers, the Parishes being no less surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with it than the Ministers themselves, and in many places the
Parishes would have defended the Ministers, if either they had been
forewarned, or sufficiently Armed, to make resistance. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
they could not gain their point in the rest of the Kingdom,
by these means, wherefore their only recourse was to the <hi>Civil Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi>
which was very favourable to them at the time, so that they
resolved to improve the occasion diligently, not knowing how long
it would last. Here the E. <hi>Crafurd</hi> was very useful to them, for his
Zeal caused them to search out all that might be attacked upon the
head of <hi>difference</hi> from the <hi>Civil Government,</hi> and he held Councils
for several Months together, only for depriving such. <hi>Oversights,
Omissions</hi> of <hi>little Formalities,</hi> and <hi>small Escapes,</hi> were aggravated as
if they had been willful and heinous Crimes. The gaining and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging
compliance with the Civil Government, was so little studied,
that all discouragement was given, that the <hi>Episcopal Party</hi> might
thereby be Incapacitated, and consequently the danger prevented,
which the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> feared from their number. There was no
place for Repentance, nor could second thoughts be of any use, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one was judged by his first resolution; and if there were but the
least flaw in ones compliance, he was dealt with as if he had not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
any compliance at all. By these means a great many more of
the <hi>Episcopal Clergy</hi> were laid aside, and the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> would have
been glad to have had all turned out this way, for then they thought
the <hi>Odium</hi> would not lye upon them. But this method failed at
last too, for the <hi>Council</hi> became weary of it, as they had reason; so
the next thing resolved on, as was reported, was to procure an <hi>Act
of Parliament,</hi> for declaring all the Churches within the Kingdom
<hi>vacant:</hi> The pretence was, that the present Incumbents were all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded
upon the Parishes, and therefore it was fit that the <hi>people</hi>
should have their free choice, and be allowed to call <hi>Ministers</hi> suitable
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:54716:17"/>
to their own Inclinations; but they were advised not to propose this,
as that which would be very far from serving their design, because
upon <hi>calculation</hi> it would be found, that most of the Parishes within
the Kingdom would call back their own Ministers, or other <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
ones,</hi> for by this time the people were every where shewing their
disgust both at <hi>Presbytery,</hi> and the present <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold
instances it appeared, that neither of them were acceptable to
the greater, and better part of the Nation. Seeing therefore they
could work no more by other mens means, the <hi>Presbyterian Clergy</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to do the work themselves, howsoever invidious it may seem
to be, and for this end they got the <hi>Government</hi> of the <hi>Church, and
all Ecclesiastical Iurisdiction,</hi> by <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> put into their own
hands. When the <hi>Covenant</hi> was in <hi>force,</hi> they found good service of
<hi>Itinerant Committees</hi> or <hi>Commissions,</hi> and they judged it would be of no
less use now, to set them up again; and so, before the rising of the
<hi>Assembly,</hi> two were appointed, <hi>one</hi> for the <hi>South,</hi> and an <hi>other</hi> for the
<hi>North,</hi> with full power to <hi>visit</hi> all <hi>Ministers,</hi> and to purge out of the
Church such as should be thought <hi>Insufficient, Scandalous, Erroneous,</hi> or
<hi>supinely Negligent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Names of the persons appointed for these <hi>Commissions,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

to be done on design to discompose them for Preaching the day
following. At this very hour also, they sent a Summons to <hi>Dr. Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:54716:18"/>
               <hi>The tenor of the Summons was this,</hi> To compeir before the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
upon the twenty first of <hi>January,</hi> to be tryed in Life and Doctrine,
and discharge of the Duties of the Ministerial Function, and censured by
the said Commission as they shall think Iust.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr. Alexander Malcolm, Mr. Iames Hutchison, Mr. Iohn Farqhuar,
Mr. Samuel Nimbo,</hi> and <hi>Mr. Andrew Lumsden,</hi> met, and all of them
resolved to take the same joint-measures, seeing they were all in
the same Circumstances. Accordingly, on the <hi>21st.</hi> day of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary,</hi>
to which they had been cited, <hi>Mr. Iames Hutchison</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
himself before the <hi>Commission,</hi> and in his own Name, and
in Name of the other four, he desired of the <hi>Commission</hi> a special
<hi>Citation,</hi> containing, and expressly naming, their <hi>Crime</hi> or <hi>Crimes,</hi>
for which they were to be tryed and censured, the <hi>Accusers</hi> and
<hi>Witnesses Names,</hi> and a competent time for preparing such <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences</hi>
as were <hi>legal and just;</hi> but all this was flatly denied. The
next day <hi>Mr. Malcolm</hi> compeired and proposed, in his own Name,
and in the Name of his Brethren, the same things, and had the
same answer, for <hi>Mr. Kennedy,</hi> the <hi>Moderator,</hi> said, <q>That the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission</hi>
was not bound to give an account why they Summoned
them, nor to tell who were their <hi>Accusers,</hi> nor for what they
were <hi>Accused,</hi> or who were to <hi>Witness</hi> against them, but that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
cited, they were obliged to answer instantly to what should
be asked of them, and if they refused, he told them the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission</hi>
had power to Censure them, and would do it. To
which Mr. <hi>Malcolm</hi> replied, That it was illegal to Summon any
<hi>Super inquirendis,</hi> that he and his Brethren were not bound either
by <hi>Civil Laws,</hi> or <hi>Ecclesiastical Cannons,</hi> to regard or obey <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
citations,</hi> and that none of them would answer, except they
got <hi>citations</hi> which were <hi>special</hi> and <hi>particular.</hi>
               </q> He added, That
they were more unjust than <hi>Festus,</hi> a Heathen Judge, for he thought
it unreasonable to send a <hi>prisoner</hi> to <hi>Caesar,</hi> and not withal to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
<hi>the crimes laid against him,</hi> but (saith he) <hi>we are here conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
before you, and you'll not tell us for what cause.</hi> Upon this
he was ordered by the <hi>Moderator</hi> to remove.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ianuary</hi> the <hi>23d,</hi> these <hi>five Ministers,</hi> to free themselves of
farther trouble from the <hi>Commission,</hi> resolved to disown and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline

took <hi>Instruments</hi> upon the delivery of it.</p>

            <p>This being the first <hi>declinature</hi> from their Authority which any
had made, therefore the <hi>Commission</hi> resolved to put some severe Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
upon it. Some proposed <hi>immediate deprivation</hi> and <hi>deposition,</hi>
others were for <hi>Excommunication,</hi> and, as was said, the <hi>first</hi> carried
it over the <hi>last,</hi> only by <hi>two Votes,</hi> which was intimated in the
several Churches the very next <hi>Lords day.</hi> As the <hi>Commission</hi> was
censured by some, for their rigid and summar proceedings against
these Ministers, and never offering to treat with them in any gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
manner, so these <hi>five Ministers</hi> were blamed by others, for their
precipitancy in declining the <hi>Commission;</hi> for it was said, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
so far owned them as to appear before them, and formerly
to give up their <hi>Session Books,</hi> when they were asked of them, it
was no ways agreeable now to give in a <hi>declinature:</hi> And as their
practices were disagreeable and inconsistent, so they had thereby
much wronged themselves, for by this means they had occasioned
their own <hi>deprivation</hi> and <hi>deposition,</hi> whereas, if they had taken
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:54716:19"/>
an other course, compeired before the <hi>Commission,</hi> and suffered
them to accuse and lead probation, as they would have been obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to do, they might have continued in their Offices a longer
time and perhaps defeat the <hi>Commission</hi> altogether, because it would
have been very hard to have proven any thing, that might have
deposed any of them; and if they had only <hi>appealed,</hi> when the
<hi>Commission</hi> was about to do them some palpable Injustice, they
then might have expected <hi>protection</hi> and <hi>redress</hi> from the <hi>Civil
Authority<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
               </hi> but these <hi>Ministers</hi> answered thus for themselves, That
some of them had never any ways owned the <hi>Presbyterian Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
as yet, and others of them but very little, and that that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
acknowledgment which they had made, could neither infer
that they had renounced their former <hi>Sentiments</hi> about <hi>Episcopacy,</hi>
nor yet entirely submitted to <hi>Presbytery,</hi> and that they had good
reason to decline or disown the <hi>Commission,</hi> considering the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice</hi>
and <hi>Illegality</hi> of their proceedings, which was both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to <hi>Scripture,</hi> the <hi>Canons</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and the <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,</hi>
owned by themselves; for as in <hi>Scripture</hi> it is commanded,
first to <hi>tell men their faults in private,</hi> and not <hi>to receive any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation
against an Elder of the Church, but before two or three Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses.</hi>
So by an <hi>Act</hi> of the <hi>Assembly</hi> at <hi>Perth, March</hi> 1. 1596.
none ought to be summoned, <hi>super inquirendis,</hi> without instancing
the Names of the Accusers, and the crimes and faults they are
accused of. And by an other <hi>Act of a General Assembly</hi> at <hi>St. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews,
April</hi> 24. 1582. it is appointed that Ministers within the
Kingdom should have <hi>forty days</hi> allowed them, whereas only ten
had been given them. They said further, that they had reason
to <hi>disown</hi> the <hi>Commission,</hi> and to refuse to appear before them,
considering how they had treated others, and how <hi>partial</hi> they
were; that they were not <hi>Iudges</hi> properly, but <hi>Parties</hi> and <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi>
who had resolved upon their ruine before ever they met,
and, who had not only determined to have them out, <hi>quovis
modo,</hi> but had also assigned their several Churches to particular
persons, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Grayfrier Church</hi> to Mr. <hi>Gilbert Rule,</hi> the <hi>Old
Church</hi> to Mr. <hi>Blair,</hi> and the <hi>Tolbooth Church</hi> to Mr. <hi>Kirkton,</hi> which
was indeed commonly talked long before, and it proving true,
was a demonstration that there was a <hi>laid</hi> and <hi>formed design</hi> of
turning out all the Ministers of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> by one means or other,
though they themselves were the occasion of the more speedy exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of it.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding the <hi>Act</hi> and <hi>Sentence</hi> of the <hi>Commission,</hi> these <hi>five
Ministers</hi> were resolved to continue the Exercise of their Ministry,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:54716:19"/>
unless they met with violence from a <hi>Rabble,</hi> or that the <hi>Civil
Magistrate</hi> concurred with the <hi>Commission.</hi> Many thought the <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Magistrate</hi> would not meddle in the matter, and a <hi>Rabble</hi>
was not much feared in <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> These who frequented the
<hi>Episcopal Churches,</hi> were resolved to defend their Ministers, if they
met with any disturbance, but on <hi>Saturday</hi> and <hi>Sunday</hi> morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
the <hi>Provost</hi> of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> sent to Mr. <hi>Malcolm,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hutchison,</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Farqhuar,</hi> forbidding them, upon the highest peril, to
attempt Preaching, or to be seen about their Churches that day,
so they kept their Houses; and the <hi>Episcopal Party</hi> being disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
came back from the Churches both in discontent and
rage, and if their temper were as much enclined to Tumults, as
the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> are, a little matter would have occasioned one
that day: And indeed, the <hi>Provost</hi> feared it, and upon the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
of it, ordered the <hi>Captain</hi> of the <hi>Town Guards</hi> to have
all his Men together in readiness, for preventing any such
thing.</p>
            <p>All the <hi>Ministers</hi> of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> were now laid aside, either by
the <hi>Council,</hi> or the <hi>Commissions,</hi> except Mr. <hi>Wilkie</hi> in the <hi>Tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>booth
Church,</hi> who was also at this time turned out by a <hi>cunning
Trick,</hi> which had no <hi>parallel</hi> then, and indeed none but the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians</hi>
are capable of giving any; but if they continue we may
come to have enough such instances; for Mr. <hi>Craig</hi> of the <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
Gate,</hi> his Case is much like it, as shall be related afterwards.
Upon Dr. <hi>Robertson</hi>'s death, Mr. <hi>Wilkie</hi> was appointed by an <hi>Act</hi>
of the <hi>Town Council,</hi> to go to the <hi>Gray Frier Church,</hi> to be Colleague to
Mr. <hi>Hutchison</hi> there, because no <hi>Presbyterian</hi> would joyn either,
and because by putting them together, they saved a Church,
for the use of one of their <hi>Presbyterian Ministers;</hi> who keep at as
great distance from these that are <hi>Episcopal,</hi> as ever their <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dccessors</hi>
the <hi>Pharisees</hi> did from Heathens and Publicans, whom
yet our Saviour often preferred to them: When Mr. <hi>Wilkie</hi> was
advertised of this by <hi>Two</hi> of their numbe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, <hi>viz. George Hume</hi>
Bailiff, and <hi>Iames Crawford</hi> Apothecary, sent to him for this
end; he replied, <hi>That he would very readily obey the good Town,
provided his Legal Right, as one of the Ministers of</hi> Edingburgh,
<hi>was not thereby prejudged or obstructed:</hi> And then it was told him,
that he needed not fear that, for there was no design to wrong
him, by transplanting him. This was on the <hi>23d.</hi> of <hi>Ianuary,</hi>
and on the <hi>25th.</hi> Mr. <hi>Kirkton</hi> was brought to the <hi>Tolbooth Church,</hi>
and settled Minister in it, without the Call or Consent of the
Parish, the Formality of an <hi>Edict,</hi> or any thing of that Nature,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:54716:20"/>
usual in the <hi>admission</hi> of a Minister: But while Mr. <hi>Wilkie</hi> was
thinking to take possession of the <hi>Gray Friers Church,</hi> the Lord
<hi>Provost</hi> sends for him, acquainting him, that the <hi>Commission</hi> had
appointed Mr. <hi>David Williamson</hi> to preach in the <hi>Gray Frier Church,</hi> for
intimating the <hi>Sentence</hi> of <hi>Deposition</hi> against Mr. <hi>Hutchison,</hi> wherefore
his <hi>Lordship</hi> desired to forbear that day, for Mr. <hi>David</hi> craved both
<hi>forenoon</hi> and <hi>afternoon,</hi> and he assured him, that he should sustain no
prejudice by it, to which Mr. <hi>Wilkie</hi> also yeilded, being very desirous
to please them, and gain their favour. Some other Excuse was invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for shifting the next <hi>Sunday</hi> to, and so on for <hi>two</hi> or <hi>three Sundays,</hi>
till Mr. <hi>Wilkie</hi> turned impatient at their delayes to settle him in the
<hi>Gray Friers Church,</hi> when he had so easily parted with the <hi>Tolbooth
Church:</hi> And he was not a little apprehensive of some disingenuous

            <p>But when pretences and dissimulation could no more be
used, it was plainly told him, that the <hi>Gray Frier Church</hi> was
to be otherwise bestowed, notwithstanding he had not only
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:54716:21"/>
the <hi>private promise</hi> and assurance of the <hi>Provost</hi> and other <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates,</hi>
but also the publick Faith of the <hi>Town Council,</hi> by
an <hi>Act</hi> of theirs dated. <hi>Ianuary</hi> 23, which was the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
on which he parted with the <hi>Tolbooth Church,</hi> Tho Mr.
<hi>Wilkie</hi> might have guessed this from the first time that they
desired his forbearance to preach; and tho he was forewarn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by several Persons, that a Trick was designed him, yet he
could not keep himself from being mightily surprised and
troubled at this final Answer and Resolution: The loss of his
Living vext him, and the manner of taking it away was
matter of more vexation, than if it had been done by the
formality of a Sentence, tho never so unjust. It galled him
exceedingly, that he should have been so simple as to trust
men of no ingenuity, and that by currying the favour of
those, who designed him a Cheat, he had suffered himself
to be Trickt ont of his Ministry without <hi>Citation</hi> or <hi>Process,</hi>
and while he was under no <hi>Sentence</hi> or <hi>Censure,</hi> neither was
<hi>accused</hi> of any <hi>crime</hi> or <hi>maleversation,</hi> which might have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
him. He made great Complaints, but they had no
success. The good Lord <hi>Provost</hi> and <hi>Bailiffs</hi> excused them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in that the <hi>Ministers</hi> would not quit the possession
they had got, and the <hi>Ministers</hi> on the other hand, told
him, that his business was with the <hi>Magistrates,</hi> for they
had not meddled with him; he had not consulted them,
when he dimited the <hi>Tolbooth Church,</hi> and as they were
not to enquire upon what terms he did it, so he could not
blame them for taking possession of <hi>Churches</hi> that were <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant.</hi>
Thus betwixt the two he was kept out of his just rights,
and all the defence that can be made for it, is, That the
<hi>Presbyterians</hi> had now declared open War with the <hi>Episcopal
Party,</hi> and their Allies, and all that had been in <hi>confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi>
with them: And in War men use not much to regard
the points of Justice and Ingenuity; If the enemy be defeated
and weakened, it is no matter by what means, whether
by giving fair and open Battle, or by secret Ambuscades;
the Cities or Castles which are once in possession are kept,
tho they have been won not by force or generous valour, but by
baseness and treachery.</p>
            <p>After much importunity to silence his clamour, they first
proffered him Mr. <hi>Kirtons Meeting House,</hi> in the <hi>Castle Hill,</hi>
which he refused, because it was an uncertain thing, and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:54716:21"/>
none of the <hi>legal Churches</hi> of the <hi>City,</hi> to one of which he
had an undoubted Right. Then at last they bestowed on
him the <hi>Lady Yesters Church,</hi> Which he has accepted of, and
seems to be contented with at present: But it will be found,
that they are still befooling him; for besides that the <hi>Earl of
Twedale</hi> debates with the <hi>Good Town</hi> the Right of planning
that Church, it has no Parish annexed to it, and the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates</hi>
of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> when they find their opportunity, may
have many pretences, for the shutting it up again. But it
was believed, and not without Reason, that the giving this
Church to Mr. <hi>Wilkie,</hi> was done not so much to repair the
injury he had received, as to be a pretext for turning out
Mr. <hi>Craig</hi> and his People, that having no other place to go
to, they might find themselves under a kind of necessity, of
uniting with the <hi>Presbyterian Congr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>gation</hi> in the <hi>Connon-gate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Because I have mentioned this Case of Mr. <hi>Craig,</hi> and
that it hath some resemblance to that of Mr. <hi>Wilkie,</hi> I will
give some short-account of it here, tho it was posterior to
the other in time, by several months. This Mr. <hi>Craig</hi> is
one of the Ministers of the <hi>Cannon-gate,</hi> and has had the
whole charge of that <hi>Parish</hi> these two or three years, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Mr. <hi>Burnet,</hi> the other Minister, was deprived by the
<hi>Council.</hi> This Parish of the <hi>Cannon-gate</hi> had the use of the
<hi>Lady Yesters Church,</hi> from the <hi>Town</hi> of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> until such
time as a <hi>new-one</hi> of their own should be built. When this
<hi>new one</hi> was finished, which was only in <hi>Summer last,</hi> the
<hi>Presbytery</hi> of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> appointed another Mr. <hi>Wilkie,</hi> who
preached in the <hi>Meeting-house</hi> to take possession of it, and
with his Elders to choose another <hi>Minister,</hi> as if there had
been a <hi>total vacancy,</hi> never regarding Mr. <hi>Craig</hi>'s right to
be a Minister there. Mr. <hi>Craig,</hi> and those of the <hi>Episcopal
Perswasion</hi> in that <hi>Parish,</hi> which are in proportion more
than <hi>three</hi> of <hi>four,</hi> when they heard this they addressed the
<hi>Presbytery</hi> for the maintenance of their rights and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
and receiving no satisfactiun from them, they brought
it before the <hi>Lords of the Council,</hi> where also the <hi>Presbyterian</hi>
party prevailed; for the <hi>Council,</hi> ratified and approved the
<hi>Orders</hi> of the <hi>Presbytery,</hi> and so Mr. <hi>Craig</hi> was shuffled out
of his Right, tho he was willing to submit to Presbytery,
and to joyn with Mr. <hi>Wilkie</hi> the Presbyterian, and had
condescended not only not to pretend to any <hi>priority</hi> and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:54716:22"/>
               <hi>preceedency,</hi> as the <hi>Elder Minister</hi> and <hi>possessour,</hi> but even also to
yield the <hi>precedency</hi> to Mr. <hi>Wilkie,</hi> and to serve only as <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Minister.</hi> Mr. <hi>Craig</hi> being thus kept out of the <hi>New
Church</hi> of the <hi>Cannon-gate,</hi> resolved to continue preaching
in the <hi>Lady Yesters Church,</hi> and his wonted Hearers were
also resolved to wait still upon him there; but that being
considered as dangerous to the <hi>Presbyterian Interest</hi> in the
<hi>Cannon gate,</hi> and a too great occasion of withdrawing the
people from Mr. <hi>Wilkie</hi> the <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> therefore the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates</hi>
of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> were advised to give the <hi>Lady Yester-Church</hi>
to Mr. <hi>Thomas Wilkie,</hi> who had been Minister of the
<hi>Tolbooth Church,</hi> by which means Mr. <hi>Craig</hi> has no Church
at all to preach in, and is forced to take refuge in an <hi>old
Chappel,</hi> lying near the <hi>Water-gate,</hi> in the foot of the
<hi>Cannon-gate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to return to the <hi>Commission</hi> of the <hi>General Assembly,</hi>
who were busie about their work of purging, the Church:
Great endeavours were used to fix some scandal or other
upon Mr. <hi>Iohn Monro,</hi> Minister of <hi>Sterlin,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Kay,</hi> Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of <hi>South Leith,</hi> that the <hi>Commission</hi> might, take occasion
to deprive them, and by that means, get those two conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous
Churches into their possession; but both of them
appeared for themselves, and defended themselves so shout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that the <hi>Commission</hi> could gain no ground. Mr. <hi>Monro</hi>
upbraided the <hi>Presbyterian party,</hi> to their face, with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude
towards him, for he shewed how kind he had
been to them in former times; that some of them he
had visited and relieved while they were in Prison, and
that he had even been Instrumental in saving some of them
from the <hi>Gallows;</hi> and yet, for a requital, they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing
not only to deprive him of his Livelihood and
Ministry, but also of his <hi>good Name,</hi> which is dearer to
one than his Life. When they perceived that sufficient Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
could not be laid against him, they tryed to work
him up to a <hi>voluntary dimission.</hi> The chief <hi>Accuser</hi> and <hi>Leader</hi>
on of the <hi>Process,</hi> came to him one day, and told him, That
if he would dimit, they would pass from the Libel, and give an
ample Declaration of his Innocence. This past in private, and
being for his Reputation, to have some publick and undoubted
evidences of the same, he went presently to the <hi>Commission,</hi>
and told the <hi>Moderator</hi> the proposal that had been made to him,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:54716:22"/>
and made the Person to own it publickly before them; for it was so
recent, that he had neither a Face to deny it, nor yet time to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the <hi>inconveniency</hi> of acknowledging it. And Mr. <hi>Monro</hi> says,
that this Man confess'd before them all, that the <hi>Libel</hi> was not true,
and they were only desirous to be rid of Mr. <hi>Monro,</hi> that by his
removal they might get a Minister of their own Persu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>sions: Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which <hi>Mr. Monro</hi> took occasion to reason his Case with the
Commission, and to convince them how much he was injured: but
the Moderator would not be rash in as<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>

                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap> Day
there fell out a remarkable Passage, which shews what an <hi>honest
Witness</hi> a Presbyterian will make. While <hi>Mr. Monro</hi> was pleading
his Case before the Commissi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>n, he had a Nephew attending him
without Doors, who fell a discoursing with a Countryman, whom he
perceived very curious to know what the Commission was a doing;
disguising his own Sentiments, he asked the <hi>Countryman,</hi> what was
his Business, he told him he was come in to help away the <hi>wicked
Curates:</hi> Then the other said the <hi>Curate of Sterlin</hi> was presently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Commission,</hi> that it would be for the Glory of God and good
Service done to the Church to have him out, but that they wanted
<hi>Witnesses;</hi> and so he asked if he would go in and witness against him,
to which the <hi>Fellow</hi> replyed, that <hi>indeed he knew him not, but for the
Glory of God and the good of the Church he was very ready and willing
to do it:</hi> Just as he was saying this one of the <hi>Presbyterian Ministers</hi>
passes by, and overhearing it, cryed to the <hi>Fellow</hi> to take heed to
himself, for he was amongst his Enemies; and he added that he
ought not to witness falsly upon any account, that it might not
be thought that they approved of such things.</p>
            <p>But in truth there are too many Instances which prove that
the <hi>Presbyterian Clergy</hi> look at Truth as little as their Witnesses that
are adduced before them: for they do not receive the <hi>exculpation</hi> of
any <hi>Episcopal Minister</hi> so readily and willingly as they do a <hi>Libel</hi>
or <hi>Indictment</hi> against them: They mark punctually what has a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
to render him <hi>odious</hi> or <hi>criminal,</hi> but nothing which makes
for his <hi>Vindication,</hi> or the clearing of his Innocence. So this very
<hi>Commission,</hi> having charged Mr. <hi>Key</hi> of <hi>South-Leith</hi> with Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
none of the Witnesses could prove it; and one of them was
so far from doing it, that he evidently proved the contrary: Upon
which Mr. <hi>Hugh Kennedy</hi> the Moderator, bad the <hi>Clerk</hi> write, <hi>Nihil
novit in causa.</hi> The <hi>Witness</hi> understanding Latin, replyed, Sir, <hi>how
can you say so, for I know very<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap> much of the matter; I have declared and
made it evident to you, that Mr.</hi> Key <hi>was not drunk at that time you
speak of:</hi> Upon which another Brother rose up and spoke in Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:54716:23"/>
               <hi>Sir, you were brought hither to witness against your Minister, and
not to clear him or plead for him.</hi> Whence it is evident, that it was
not the Truth they were seeking; and all the reason they had to
conclude Mr. <hi>Key</hi> drunk at that time, was, because he had baptized
two Children in one day, and was at both their Entertainments,
as if one could not be witness to a Feast without running to excess.</p>
            <p>During the sitting of this <hi>Commission,</hi> the 30 day of <hi>Ianuary,</hi>

The Observation of it last year was opposed by the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian
Clergy,</hi> they both refus'd to preach upon the Subject Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and Argument of the <hi>Day;</hi> and also to delay the going to Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<hi>till ten a Clock,</hi> which was desired, that the <hi>Lords of Council and
Session,</hi> and others of the Nobility and Gentry might come to Church
more solemnly as the <hi>Day</hi> required. And because they were so
strict upon their <hi>Hours,</hi> the only Remedy was to keep back the
Clock, which was made to strike <hi>eight</hi> only when it was <hi>ten</hi> by the
Course of the Sun, because that is the <hi>ordinary hour</hi> of beginning their
<hi>Weekly Sermons.</hi> It was Mr. <hi>Hugh Kennedy's</hi> turn to preach, and tho
the <hi>Pulpit</hi> and all the rest of the Church was hung with <hi>Black,</hi>
yet the <hi>little old Fox</hi> came up in a <hi>Gray Cloak,</hi> and held forth his <hi>Hour</hi>
without touching the occasion directly or indirectly, either in his
<hi>Sermon</hi> or <hi>Prayer:</hi> He durst not condemn the thing, because most
People in the Church knew he was an Accessary to it. And I
know a Gentleman, who made haste to see him in the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> saying,
he thought the Pulpit should break, or the Black fall of while <hi>Kennedy</hi>
was in it, as well as the Corps used to bleed at the presence of the
Murtherer. To which it was answered, that Miracles were wrought
to detect secret and hidden Murthers, but not to attest those which
were known and transacted in the Face of the Sun.</p>
            <p>This Year, to get this <hi>Anniversary</hi> duly observed, the <hi>Court of
Session</hi> was adjourned for that day, and both <hi>Lords of Council and
Session</hi> sent some of their number to wait upon the <hi>Commission,</hi> and
to desire that they would appoint one to preach to them a <hi>Sermon</hi>
for the <hi>Day;</hi> Sir <hi>Colin Campbel</hi> of <hi>Arbruchell</hi> was one of them
who was sent after he had delivered the <hi>Request</hi> of the <hi>Council and
Session,</hi> which all others think in such Cases to be equivalent to a
<hi>Command:</hi> the <hi>Moderator</hi> said to him, <hi>My Lord, we are very busie and
have much to do, and should not be hindered: And you and the rest all know
well enough that it's not agreeable to our Persuasion to keep days.</hi> To which
it might have been replyed, that none of them make any scruple of
keeping Days, which bring them in Money, for they preach very
frankly at the <hi>Anniversary</hi> of <hi>George Heriot</hi> in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> by which

an hundreth <hi>Marks Scots</hi> come to the Preachers Pocket. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
was so civil as to deliberate about the Request: but the Re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sult
was, That they could not obey it; which the <hi>Lords of Council
and Session</hi> were highly offended with, as being an Affront to their
Authority; and therefore sent them Word, That unless they did
obey them, they would not suffer them to have any <hi>other Sermon</hi>
that day. The <hi>Lord Provost</hi> had Orders to see that their Will in
this was observed; who therefore forbad ringing of Bells to the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<hi>Weekly Sermon,</hi> but forgot to call for the <hi>Keys</hi> of the <hi>Church Doors,</hi>
so that they caused the <hi>Trone Church</hi> to be opened, whither they went
and set up <hi>Mr. Shields</hi> to preach, which was interpreted a greater <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt</hi>
of the <hi>Authority of Council and Session,</hi> than if it had been any
other Person; because this <hi>Mr. Shields</hi> in a Book of his, entituled,
<hi>The Hind let loose,</hi> doth expresly defend and justifie <hi>the Murther of
King</hi> Charles <hi>the First,</hi> and the <hi>Assassination</hi> of the <hi>Archbishop of St.
Andrews.</hi> In the beginning of his Sermon he said, <hi>It may be expected
that I should speak something of that Man that dyed forty years ago:
He either dyed justly or unjustly: If unjustly, it was the better for himself:
if justly, we need not trouble our selves more about him.</hi> The rest of
his Sermon was stuffed with <hi>Invectives</hi> against <hi>Bishops,</hi> and the <hi>Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal
Clergy</hi> and the <hi>Church of England;</hi> and he held forth, that it
was very unlawful to keep any Confederacy with <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Mr. Shields</hi> is one of the <hi>Three Cameronians,</hi> who addressed
to the Assembly, as was said before in the <hi>Historical Relation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:</hi>
since that time he hath published a <hi>Pamphlet,</hi> called, <hi>An Account
of the Methods and Motives of the late Union and submission to the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly:</hi>
in which all the steps of <hi>his</hi> and <hi>his two Brothers</hi> Proceedings
are narrated, and the larger Paper published; which the <hi>Assembly</hi>
thought to have suppressed altogether, because it contain'd some
Reflections on the Members of the Assembly. When all is consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
the coming in of these <hi>Cameronians</hi> appears a kind of Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
which cannot be well understood, for there seems not to be a true
<hi>Union,</hi> but only a kind of <hi>Truce</hi> for present Conveniency; or if there
be any <hi>Union,</hi> the <hi>Condescendence</hi> is upon the <hi>Assembly's side;</hi> so that
it may be said, the <hi>Assembly</hi> has turned <hi>Cameronian:</hi> For <hi>Mr. Shi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>lds</hi>
and his <hi>Two Brethren</hi> declare, That they have not retracted any
thing they said or did formerly; and as they would not condemn
their own Principles and Practices, so they have laid heavy
and grievous things to the charge of those in the <hi>Assembly,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent
with the Principles of <hi>true Covenanted Presbyterians;</hi> which,
as <hi>Mr. Shields</hi> observes, the <hi>Assembly</hi> has not contradicted nor refuted.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:54716:24"/>
And as their Silence is a tacite Confession of their Guilty, which they
also acknowledge in general Terms, in the <hi>Act</hi> and <hi>Reasons</hi> for the
<hi>Fast,</hi> so the receiving <hi>Men</hi> into their Communion without Check
or Censure, who teach publickly in their Sermons, and maintain
in their <hi>Books, Tenets,</hi> and <hi>Positions,</hi> which are both Scandalous to
Religion, and also destructive of human Society: I say this is an
evidence that they are of the same mind, and have no abhorrence
of such scandalous and pernicious Principles, as those men have
vented. But though the Assembly and <hi>Mr. Shields, Mr. Linning,</hi> and
<hi>Mr. Boide</hi> have made an Agreement, without coming to particulars<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
or expressing the mutual Terms or Conditions; yet the other <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meronians</hi>
refused to patch up a Peace so easily; they require ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
and particular Declarations from <hi>the other Presbyterians,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
that what <hi>Mr. Shi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>lds</hi> and his <hi>Two Brethren</hi> did, may be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
as their own <hi>Private Deed,</hi> and not the <hi>Deed</hi> of the whole Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
and it is said the <hi>Breach</hi> is rather wider than it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
<hi>Mr. Howston,</hi> who now heads the <hi>Cameronians,</hi> refused to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
his Call to the <hi>Kirk</hi> of <hi>Kilsyth,</hi> to the <hi>Presbytery</hi> of <hi>Glasgow;</hi> and
when one who was sent from that <hi>Presbytery</hi> to preach there, possessed
the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> it's reported, that he went up to a <hi>Loft</hi> or <hi>Gallery</hi> in the
Church, and instead of instructing the people, they fell soul upon
one another: Whatever be of this, it's certain the <hi>Parish</hi> was divided
upon this Head, and one part followed the one, and another the
other. To such a height is this difference arrived, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be
decided by no meaner person than the <hi>King;</hi> so that <hi>Mr. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston</hi>
went to <hi>Flanders</hi> that King <hi>William</hi> might interpose his Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
for repairing the Injury he had received; and I am told that he
not only complained of his own Treatment, but also represented
to his <hi>Majesty,</hi> that the <hi>Assembly</hi> and other <hi>Presbyterians</hi> took mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
that were not good either for Church or Kingdom. Thus,
though they will not acknowledge the <hi>King</hi> to be the <hi>Head of their
Kirk,</hi> yet they, as well as others, will have recourse to him on oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion.
He succeeded so well, that he procured <hi>two Letters</hi> from the
<hi>King</hi> in his behalf, one to the <hi>Council,</hi> another to the <hi>Presbytery</hi> of
<hi>Glasgow:</hi> He delivered the first to my Lord <hi>Crawford,</hi> and went with
the other to <hi>Glasgow:</hi> The <hi>Presbytery</hi> received it; and to prevent any
Protestation he might make for their not obeying it, they said to him,
that some of the Brethren should be appointed to confer with him; and
in the mean time they dissolved the <hi>Meeting</hi> and did nothing. Upon
this he returned to <hi>Edinburgh</hi> to be redressed by the <hi>Council;</hi> but
when he came there he found that his <hi>Letter</hi> had never been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd,
and <hi>Crawford,</hi> to whom he had delivered it, had taken
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:54716:24"/>
Journey for <hi>London,</hi> so that he is still where he was: and by this
it appears, that <hi>Kings</hi> Recommendations avail but little with
some Men.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Howston</hi> has a <hi>Brother,</hi> who also will not unite with our <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
men;</hi> but goes up and down drawing <hi>People</hi> from <hi>them,</hi> as
they were wont to do from the <hi>Episcopal Ministers:</hi> being found
in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> he was shut up in Prison, and detained <hi>several Months;</hi>
till of late with difficulty he hath procured his enlargment. So
little reason is there to talk of their Harmony and Union, except
it be in the opposition, which both make to the <hi>Episcopal Party,</hi> that
the <hi>Cameronians,</hi> to distinguish themselves the better from the other
<hi>Presbyterians,</hi> have taken up a <hi>new Name,</hi> viz. That of the <hi>Society;</hi>
they do not add, of <hi>Iesus,</hi> lest they should be taken for the <hi>Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi>
of <hi>Ignatius Loyola.</hi> Those of this <hi>Sect</hi> sometimes begin their <hi>Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi>
at <hi>Ten</hi> or <hi>Twelve</hi> at <hi>Night,</hi> or at the <hi>dawning</hi> of the <hi>Morning,</hi> and
they use to be well armed with <hi>Swords</hi> and <hi>Staves;</hi> and I'm told
there have been hard blows given betwixt them and the other
<hi>Presbyterians</hi> in the <hi>Southern</hi> and <hi>Western Shives,</hi> as happened in the
<hi>late times:</hi> so now we may expect <hi>variety of Sects</hi> and <hi>Opinions,</hi> which
will ruin <hi>Religion,</hi> as well as disturb the <hi>publick Peace</hi> and <hi>Quiet.</hi>
For <hi>Fanaticism</hi> is a <hi>Spiritual Vertigo;</hi> which makes people reel and
stagger from side to side, and run about till they fall into <hi>Atheism</hi>
and <hi>gross Impiety.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To return to the <hi>Commissi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>n,</hi> which sat down again upon <hi>Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesday</hi>
the Fifteenth of <hi>April:</hi> When they were met, Sir <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am
Leccart</hi> the King's <hi>Sollicitor</hi> came and presented to the <hi>Moderator</hi>
a Letter from the <hi>King,</hi> which was not received with that Respect
which was due. The <hi>Moderator,</hi> without rising from his <hi>Seat,</hi> bad
him give it in to the <hi>Clerk,</hi> telling him, <hi>That there was very much
noise of that Letter:</hi> For indeed it was not only talked of, but also se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Copies of it were spread up and down both <hi>City</hi> and <hi>Country.</hi>
Then the <hi>Moderator</hi> turn'd to the <hi>Clerk,</hi> and said, <hi>Man take off the Scab
of the Wamb of it, and see what's within it,</hi> for so, as is said, he called
the <hi>King's Seal</hi> upon it. This Letter was the effect of that <hi>Address,</hi>
which those Commissionated by the <hi>Episcopal Clergy,</hi> who were still
in place, made to the <hi>King</hi> before his going to <hi>Flanders;</hi> whither
also <hi>Two</hi> of them followed him, <hi>viz.</hi> Dr. <hi>Canaries</hi> and <hi>Mr. Lesk,</hi>
that they might even there negotiate the Affairs of their <hi>Party,</hi> and
get that stop put to the <hi>Proccedings</hi> of the <hi>Presbyterians;</hi> which was
promised them, but which could not be presently given, because of
the <hi>King</hi>'s haste to go beyond Seas. This is a true Copy of the
Letter.</p>

                  <p>WHereas there hath been humble Application made to us, by several Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
for themselves and others, who lately served under Episcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
in that our ancient Kingdom, We have thought good, as well for
the Good and Advantage of that Church, as the Publick Iustice and Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
of the Nation, and the Interest of our Government, to signifie our Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
to you, That you make no distinction of Men, otherwise well qualified
for the Ministry, who are willing to join with you, in the Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of, and Submission to the Government of Church and State, as it is by
Law now established, though they have formerly conformed to the Law in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing
Episcopacy; and that ye give them no vexation or disturbance for
that cause, or upon that head; and that in regard many of these Ministers
are turned out summary, without any Sentence or Order of Law, if such
shall be called to be Ministers of any Congregations, by plurality of
Heritors and Elders, we judge it reasonable that you admit them, where
there is no just Cause to the contrary, without making any difficulty. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
some of these Ministers complain of Severities and Hardships by several
Sentences pronounced against them, we think fit to give you opportunity to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view
what Cases shall be brought before you, that your selves may give such
just Redresses as the matter requireth, before we take any further notice of
these Complaints.</p>
                  <p>We will assure you we will protect you, and maintain the Government of
the Church, in that our ancient Kingdom, by Presbytery, without suffering
any invasion to be made upon it: And therefore we will expect; That you
will avoid all occasions of Divisions and Resentments, and cordially unite
with those that will agree with you in the Doctrine of the Protestant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and own the Confession of Faith, which the Law hath established as the
Standard of the Communion of that Church. And it is our Pleasure, That
during our absence out of <hi>Britain,</hi> until we give our further Directions, that
you proceed to no more Process or any other Business, and dispose your selves
to give out your best Means, for healing and reconciling Differnces; and
apply your selves to give impartial Redresses upon any Complaints that shall be offered unto you, against Sentences already past, that we be not obliged to

give our selves any further trouble thereanent. So we bid you heartily fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel.

            <p>When this <hi>Letter</hi> was read, the Anger and Displeasure of the <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi>
was to be seen in their Countenances: One said that there was
no regard to be had to <hi>it,</hi> because the <hi>King's Hand</hi> was not at <hi>it.</hi>
Another replied, That whether it had come only from the <hi>Secretary</hi>
himself, or been sent by the order of the <hi>King,</hi> there was no reason
to take any notice of it, or be concerned with it; for it proceeded
from a mistake and mis-information, as if they had turned out any
summarly, without any Sentence or Order of Law, whereas they
were conscious of no such thing. It is reported of the <hi>Moderator,</hi> That
when the <hi>Contents</hi> of this <hi>Letter</hi> were first imparted to him, he said,
<hi>If the King had not so many Men at his back, he would make two of it:</hi>
But a <hi>Person</hi> of <hi>Honour</hi> assured me, That when he was speaking to
him of <hi>it,</hi> his answer was, <hi>That the King would be as wise to let these
matters alone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After much deliberation, it was resolved to write an <hi>Answer</hi> to the
King, and to send <hi>two</hi> of their number to negotiate their Affairs
with his <hi>Majesty,</hi> and to remove the Prejudices he might have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
against them by false Representations. The Persons who
were thought fit to be sent, were Mr. <hi>Iohn Law,</hi> and Mr. <hi>David Blair.</hi>
The <hi>Letter</hi> which they were to carry with them, was but once read
publickly; nor did the <hi>Moderator</hi> suffer any at the time, to propose
his Judgment about it; for he said, That there was a <hi>private Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee</hi>
appointed for that matter, and so he desired every one to come
in apart by himself, and there to declare his Mind, what he would
have added to it, or taken away from it: Which was done either to
keep the thing more secret, or that the <hi>Draught of the Letter,</hi> which
the <hi>Moderator</hi> and other leading Men had made, might pass more
easily without any change. The King's <hi>Letter</hi> required two things:
<hi>One</hi> was to redress the Grievances which the <hi>Episcopal Ministers</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
of: The <hi>other</hi> was, To forbear the proceeding any more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them, so long as the <hi>King</hi> was absent from <hi>Britain.</hi> They had
no Mind to grant the <hi>first</hi> at all; but in compliance with the <hi>last,</hi>
they thought it convenient to stop a little, that they might not give
their Adversaries occasion to irritate the <hi>King</hi> against them, and to
withdraw his Favour, which was their only present support. The
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:54716:26"/>
yielding to this, was only a delaying their Affairs, till they were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
stated, which afterwards might be ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ily compensated; and by
doing so, they would dispose the <hi>King</hi>'s Mind for receiving their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences
for what was already done. So leaving all things as they
were, the <hi>Commission</hi> was adjourned till the next <hi>Qarterly Sessi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>n.</hi> But
it must not be forgot, that they left particular <hi>Presbyteries</hi> and <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods,</hi>
to act their part in the mean time, for they issued out no Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to stop them, neither made they any intimation of the <hi>King's
Letter,</hi> or of his <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Pleasure</hi> therein unto them; so that when it
was objected by any <hi>Episcopal Minister,</hi> they still pretended igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Month</hi> the <hi>Synod</hi> of <hi>Lothian</hi> and <hi>Tueddale</hi> met at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and
concluded a <hi>Monthly Fast</hi> to be kept for some time: For this end, the
<hi>Secret Council</hi> was addressed to, that they might ratifie and approve
the same by an Act: Which indeed they did; but Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi>
would admit of no other reason for the <hi>Fast,</hi> than that of the <hi>present
War,</hi> and the <hi>King's Expedition to Flanders.</hi> This did not a little dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please
the <hi>Brethren,</hi> who, to delude and amuse the People, and to
serve their own particular Ends, had heap'd up a number of such
Reasons, as the <hi>Assembly</hi> gave for the <hi>former Fast:</hi> Wherefore, because
the <hi>Council</hi> would not accept of, and agree to the <hi>Act</hi> and <hi>Reasons</hi> as
they were drawn up by them, they resolved to shew no regard to
<hi>what</hi> the <hi>Council</hi> had done: So at the intimation of this <hi>new Fast,</hi>
they did take no notice of the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Council</hi> or <hi>Proclamation</hi> published
by them; but enjoyned it in the <hi>Synod</hi>'s <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Authority,</hi> reading
to the People the <hi>Act</hi> and <hi>Reasons</hi> of the <hi>Synod</hi> for it. Particularly
Mr. <hi>Kirkton</hi> in the <hi>Tolbooth Church</hi> of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> said, <hi>That they ought
to look to this Paper which came from the Synod for their direction, in the end
and nature of this Fast, and not to that other which was selling up and down
the Town;</hi> by which he meant the <hi>Act</hi> and <hi>Proclamation</hi> of the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.</hi>
The <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Crawford</hi> and <hi>two</hi> more of the <hi>Council</hi> were present.
<hi>One</hi> of them said, That the <hi>Council</hi> could not sit with this, nor let it
pass without censure; for their <hi>Authority</hi> was baffled and affronted:
But it seems it was found convenient to take no notice of it, lest
they should be more baffled and affronted, by medling with these
<hi>peremptory</hi> and <hi>stubborn Kirk-men,</hi> who are like an <hi>imperious Wife,</hi> that
will both have all <hi>her</hi> own Will, and a part of <hi>her Husbands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About the middle of <hi>Iuly,</hi> the <hi>Commission</hi> met again. Some few
days before, the <hi>two Ministers</hi> they had sent over to <hi>Flanders,</hi> retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
of whose Reception by the <hi>King,</hi> there were various Reports:
But in answer to that <hi>Letter</hi> which they carried from the <hi>Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi>
there came a <hi>second Letter</hi> from the <hi>King,</hi> which was ordered to
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:54716:26"/>
be delivered to the <hi>two Ministers,</hi> if they returned before the <hi>Meeting</hi>
of the <hi>Commission:</hi> But if they were late a-coming, another was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to give it to the <hi>Commission</hi> at its first sitting down. So the
night before Mr. <hi>Iames Elphinston</hi> went with it to Mr. <hi>Iohn Law,</hi> and
Mr. <hi>David Blair,</hi> who presented it to the <hi>Commission</hi> the next day,
with an account of their Negotiation and Diligence.</p>

presented to us from you, by Mr. <hi>John Law,</hi> and Mr. <hi>David Blair,</hi>
Ministers, your two Commissioners, we do perceive you sufficiently understood
our Intentions contained in our Letter, directed to you from the <hi>Hague;</hi>
and we are well-pleased with what you write, both as to your own unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Inclinations to redress those, who may be lesed, and to unite with such
of the Clergy, who have served under Episcopacy, and fallen neither under
the Qualifications of the Act of Parliament, nor the Terms of our Letter,
and that you are sufficiently instructed by the General Assembly to receive
them: From all which, we do expect a speedy and happy success; and that
ye will be so frank and charitable in that matter, that we cannot doubt but
that there shall be so great a progress made in this Union betwixt you, before
our return to <hi>Britain,</hi> that we shall then find no cause to continue that stop,
which at present we see necessary; and that neither you, nor any Commission<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Church-Meeting, do meddle in any process or Business, that may concern the
purging out of the Episcopal Ministers: And we do not restrain you a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

matters relative to the Church or your selves; nor did we ever intend to
protect any in the Ministry, who were truly scandalous, erroneous, or supine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
negligent; and therefore we did propose their subscribing the <hi>Confession
of Faith,</hi> as the Standard of the Church-Communion, which takes off the
suspicion of Errour: And as for those who are really scandalous, insufficient,
and supinely negligent, if such shall apply, either by themselves or with others,
though they were willing to acknowledge our Authority, and to join with
you, we do not oblige you to receive such; and in that case where there is
just cause, you may proceed to a fair impartial Inquiry, in order to their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

received in the Government of the Church, but not in relation to the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

has left them to our further Orders, we will not doubt of the sincere perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of what you have so fairly promised in your Letter, whereby you will

            <p>Ever since this Revolution, the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> has been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
about the <hi>Government</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> The <hi>Episcopal Party</hi> have
been upon the <hi>defensive side.</hi> First, they studied to preserve the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of Episcopacy</hi> it self; and for that end addressed to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
which proved altogether in vain. In the <hi>next place,</hi> when
<hi>Presbytery</hi> was established by <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> the <hi>Episcopal Clergy</hi> pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioned
for a share of the <hi>Government of the Church,</hi> or at least to be
secured from the <hi>Iurisdiction of the Presbyterians,</hi> who had declared
themselves a <hi>stated Party</hi> against them. But neither was this harken'd
to. Then, as their last Refuge, they considered how to save <hi>themselves,</hi>
their <hi>personal Rights</hi> and <hi>Priviledges,</hi> that they might sustain no <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice,</hi>
upon the account of their private Sentiments and Perswasion.
And for this cause, they resolved to address King <hi>William</hi> himself,
seeing the Applications made to others were so ineffectual: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Dr. <hi>Canaries</hi> was sent from some of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> on the <hi>South-side
of Tay;</hi> Mr. <hi>Mac Gill,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Small</hi> from <hi>Angus;</hi> Dr. <hi>Gaider,</hi> Mr. <hi>Leisk</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Fobess</hi> from the <hi>Diocess of Aberdeen.</hi> This last Design suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
better than any of the former; for the <hi>King</hi> thought their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
reasonable, and promised them his Protection in this matter;
and in both his Letters to the <hi>Commission</hi> of the <hi>Assembly,</hi> he required
this, as that which was most just and equitable. Nay, the refusing
it was judged so unreasonable, that it is said, that those <hi>Presbyterian
Ministers,</hi> who were sent up from the <hi>rest,</hi> did expresly promise to
receive such <hi>Episcopal Ministers,</hi> not only into <hi>Communion,</hi> but into the
<hi>Government,</hi> as could not be excepted against, either for Life or Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.
And which is yet more, it appears from <hi>King William's se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Letter,</hi> that the <hi>Commission</hi> has given some such thing under their
Hand.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:54716:27"/>Wherefore to try their Sincerity, it was thought fit to put them to
it, by making some of the <hi>Episcopal Clergy</hi> address to them. The <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
and <hi>form</hi> of the <hi>Address</hi> was drawn up, and concerted at <hi>London,</hi>
and sent down to <hi>Scotland</hi> with Mr. <hi>Mac Gill</hi> and Mr. <hi>Small;</hi> for it
was judged requisite they should Address all after the same manner;
the tenour of which is as followeth.</p>

and to act in Church-Judicatories for carrying on of
these Ends, without any regard to the Difference of Persuasion in
matters that are not fundamental.</p>
                        <p>We do therefore humbly and earnestly desire, That in order
to these Ends, we may be suffered to act as Presbyters in

            <p>This being proposed to the <hi>Episcopal Clergy,</hi> several Arguments
were used to persuade the subscribing it; which some declined fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

one Reason, and some for another. Some guessing the success from the
<hi>Presbyterian Temper,</hi> thought it would be a prostituting their Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to offer a thing which would not be accepted: Others apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that to be yielding of the <hi>Episcopal Cause</hi> to the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and
therefore would not do it. But in the <hi>Diocess of Aberdeen,</hi> the most
part condescended, and gave a <hi>Commission</hi> to Mr. <hi>Leisk,</hi> to wait upon
the <hi>Commission</hi> at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> so soon as it should sit, and in their Name
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:54716:28"/>
to address them as above; which he did: But the <hi>Moderator</hi> said to
him, That they could not receive it; for there was a <hi>particular Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission</hi>
appointed for all on the <hi>North side of Tay;</hi> and if the Ministers
of these places had any thing to say, they ought to say it to them.
Mr. <hi>Leisk</hi> replied, that there was no <hi>Commission</hi> sitting in the <hi>North</hi> at
that time; that he was <hi>Moderator</hi> of <hi>both Commissions,</hi> and he judged
it all one which of them he applied himself to! That the <hi>King's Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
was directed to them, which required them to receive such as
should make application unto them; and if they refused it, he would
<hi>protest,</hi> and take <hi>Instrument.</hi> The <hi>Moderator</hi> bad him do what he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;
and so after <hi>Protestation,</hi> he removed. Mr. <hi>Small</hi> went along
with Mr. <hi>Leisk;</hi> and while Mr. <hi>Leisk</hi> was talking with the <hi>Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi>
one of the Brethren rises from his seat, came towards Mr. <hi>Small,</hi>
took him by the Shoulder, and with a most <hi>frowning Countenance</hi> said
to him, <hi>Ye are a pack of prophane Raskals, and deserve no pity, neither ought
to be received.</hi> After which, he returned to his <hi>seat,</hi> leaving Mr. <hi>Small</hi>
surprized with his <hi>Discretion</hi> and <hi>Civility</hi> in such a place, and at such a
time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The same day, or the day following, Mr.</hi> Tho. Wood, <hi>Minister at</hi> Dumb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

done by</hi> Ministers <hi>on the</hi> South-side of Tay, <hi>they had not the former

by the late General Assembly of this Church, having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
a Petition presented to them by Mr. <hi>Thomas Wood,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Denune,</hi> signed by them and twelve other Ministers, who call
themselves of the Episcopal Persuasion, do find that some of these
Petitioners are deposed, some suspended, both of them for gross
Immoralities; others of them are in processes referred by the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Assembly to this Commission, and some declared contuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
by the <hi>Presbyteries</hi> of the Bounds, where they have their resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:54716:28"/>
and some live without the Bounds committed to the inspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of this Commission. They do also find, That not only these
Petitioners do not look upon this Commission as a Judicatory of this
Church, but also do mistake their Work, by ascribing to them a
Power to establish the Judicatories of this Church, which is not
committed to them by the General Assembly; and though the
Commission be satisfied to hear of their Zeal against <hi>Popery,</hi> and
Firmness in the <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> Duty and Fidelity to their <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties;</hi>
yet they find, that seeing the Petitioners have not offered to
own and subscribe the Confession of Faith, which by Law is made
the Standard of the Doctrine of this Church, they give no security
against Errours; nor do they offer to submit and concur with the
present established Government of this Church, according to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of the General Assembly, much less to acknowledge it, as
is required by his <hi>Majesty's</hi> gracious Letter: And whereas in the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition,
the Petitioners seem to desire an allowance for setting up a
Government separate from, and independent upon that which is
established by Law, and have refused, when desired by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
to explain either for their Brethren, or for themselves,
this or any other Expression that seemed dark and doubtful to the
Commission; declaring also expresly, That they had no further to
say, than what was contained in the Petition, and that they could
do nothing separately by themselves without their Constituents,
Therefore on these grounds the Commission cannot grant this Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as it stands <hi>in terminis,</hi> however willing they be to receive
such of them as personally shall be found duly qualified according to
the Instructions of the Assembly, and his Majesty's grac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            </q>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Wood</hi> and Mr. <hi>Denune</hi> having got this <hi>last Answer,</hi> they made
a <hi>Protestation</hi> against the <hi>Commission,</hi> for refusing them the Favour
which the <hi>King's Letter</hi> required of them.</p>
            <p>Some blamed both the <hi>Ministers</hi> and the <hi>Commission;</hi> and thought
that neither of them acted so candidly as did become them; for while
both pretended a willingness to unite, each of them kept at a distance,
and studied what might hinder, rather than what might fu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ther the
Union. It was said, That the Ministers did needlesly offend the
<hi>Commission</hi> by the <hi>Title</hi> of their <hi>Address;</hi> for seeing they made no
scruple of addressing to the <hi>Commission,</hi> they might have made as
little of giving them their <hi>due Title:</hi> And it was either mere nicety
to refuse it, or it was done with a design to pique them, that
they might not accept of the <hi>Address.</hi> Again it was said, That they
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:54716:29"/>
were very unreasonable in refusing to explain the <hi>ambiguous terms</hi> of
the <hi>Address,</hi> and that they gave the <hi>Commission</hi> a good pretext for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
their Request, when they would not tell what was the Nature
and Import of it; for the <hi>Commission</hi> could not be obliged to grant
what they did not understand.</p>
            <p>On the <hi>other hand,</hi> the Answer of the <hi>Commission</hi> was found
fault with very much, and it was said, that by it, they clearly
shewed that they were no wise willing to receive <hi>Episcopal Ministers,</hi>
whatsoever they had professed or wrote to the <hi>King.</hi> The very Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressing
to them was thought such a <hi>Condescendence</hi> in <hi>Episcopal Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,</hi>
as to deserve a better and more kindly reception than that
which it met with. And the <hi>Commission</hi> was censured not only as
very indiscreet, but as most unjust, for giving them these <hi>odious Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thets</hi>
in the beginning of their <hi>Answer;</hi> for there was but <hi>one</hi> or <hi>two,</hi>
whom they had any shadow or p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ence to name so; and even
these <hi>two</hi> offered to vindicate themselves, if they were allowed a fair
Hearing. The greatest part of those, who subscribed, were neither
under <hi>Process</hi> nor <hi>Censure,</hi> nor had they been at any time <hi>Libelled;</hi>
so that the <hi>Answer</hi> was unjust to them, whatever it might be to the
rest. Further, it was very unjust, to reject the <hi>Address,</hi> because the
<hi>Confession of Faith</hi> was not offered to be subscribed; for though this
was not expressed <hi>in terminis,</hi> yet it was clearly enough implied, and
it was then only time to make that <hi>Objection,</hi> when the <hi>Confession</hi> was
put to them and refused. <hi>Finally,</hi> Though the <hi>Ministers</hi> keep to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals,
and refused to explain what they meant by <hi>Acting as Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters;</hi>
yet that was thought no just or sufficient Reason for deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their <hi>Request:</hi> For if they could not grant it in the <hi>largest extent,</hi>
it was in their power to set limitations to it. They might have
been sure that <hi>Episcopal Ministers</hi> would not be received at all, if not
under the Notion and Character of <hi>true</hi> and <hi>lawful Presbyters,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being obliged to receive <hi>new Ordination:</hi> And in this Sense they
ought to have interpreted the Petition, unless the <hi>Ministers</hi> had, in
express terms, craved more. And as they could not be blamed for
refusing to allow them to <hi>act independently;</hi> so their not admitting
them as <hi>Presbyters,</hi> and not consenting to their having the <hi>Power</hi> and
<hi>Privilege</hi> of such, which was all that seemed to be required, is a
clear demonstration that either they did not own them to be <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters,</hi>
or that they did not desire to join with them.</p>
            <p>They had so <hi>few Ministers</hi> of their <hi>own Party,</hi> that it might been
thought, they would have been glad to have received any that were
willing to come over to them; but, in truth, they chused rather to
want, than to admit of any who had served under <hi>Episcopacy;</hi> and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:54716:29"/>
thought the one a less inconvenience than the other, as appears
from the treatment, which some <hi>Ministers,</hi> who were called <hi>Anti-Testers,</hi>
met with. Five of these who refused the Test, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Lun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Craig,</hi> Mr. <hi>Paterson,</hi> Mr. <hi>Marchiston,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Carmichael</hi>
made Application to them, both at their last <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ssion</hi> in <hi>April,</hi> and <hi>this</hi>
in <hi>Iuly:</hi> They thought their case more favourable than that of
other <hi>Episcopal Ministers;</hi> and it was said that they designed to go
a very great length: I cannot tell positively what it was they would
have done; for they resolved to deliver their Mind by word of
Mouth, and not to give any thing under their Hand, but <hi>they</hi> would
not so much as give them <hi>access;</hi> they would neither hear them nor
take their Case into consideration.</p>
            <p>Thus it is evident, that they were resolved not to admit any Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
of the <hi>Episcopal Persuasion,</hi> nor any who had heretofore ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
under the <hi>Episcopal Government:</hi> For though the <hi>King</hi> had requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
this in his <hi>Letter;</hi> yet by their Instructions they were enjoined
to receive none, but <hi>such as they had ground to believe would be true
and faithful to the Government.</hi> And it was concluded, that none
could be trusted to, who did not renounce their former Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
abjure Episcopacy, and cry <hi>Peccavi</hi> for their complyance
with it. But it might be reasonable enough to trust to them who did
this, because such would be so much abhorred by the <hi>Episcopal Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
whom they deserted, that they would then find it their Interest
to keep up <hi>Presbytery.</hi> This was expresly required of Mr. <hi>Thomas
Wilkie,</hi> Minister of the <hi>Tolbooth Church:</hi> for when he humbly sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated
them to be received, making great Promises of an entire
Submission to their Government; the <hi>Moderator</hi> ask'd if he had no
more to say, and pressed him to declare himself more fully. To
which Mr. <hi>Wilkie</hi> replyed, That he thought he had said enough,
and given a sufficient Declaration of his Mind. And indeed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
he had said more upon the Head than could be well justified.
Yet nothing would satisfie them unless he would say that his <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance</hi>
with <hi>Episcopacy</hi> was a Sin: And because he made a Scruple
of that, they obstructed his Business, as was related before, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
to receive him. But upon these Terms they admitted one
Mr. <hi>Menzies,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hugh Nisbet</hi> and Mr. <hi>Arrot Minister</hi> of <hi>Ginglekirk,</hi>
who are the only Persons that have gone entirely over to the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian
Party,</hi> and the <hi>Episcopal Party</hi> have sustained no loss by their
Desertion. For <hi>Mr. Hugh Nisbet</hi> has the Character of <hi>being Ignorant,
Insufficient and Scandalous; Mr. Arrot,</hi> besides that he is ignorant,
he is so sordidly Covetous, that he is not ashamed of any base
thing, if it will bring in <hi>filthy Lucre:</hi> To save himself from the
<hi>Rabble,</hi> he, at the very beginning, went to the <hi>Pulpit</hi> with Inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:54716:30"/>
against the <hi>Episcopal Government,</hi> and was not short of the
wildest <hi>Cameronian</hi> in Raillery and vile Expressions: And that
he might oblige the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> to let him keep his Possession, he
offered <hi>to put on Sackcloth</hi> and to <hi>do Penance</hi> in as may Churches as
they pleased. And as for <hi>Mr. Menzies;</hi> he was first a <hi>Hill-Preacher;</hi>
next he submitted to <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> and received a Church under that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
which afterward he deserted, and run again to the
<hi>Hills,</hi> and was in the <hi>Rebellion</hi> at <hi>Bothwell-Bridge,</hi> which rendred him
obnoxious to the Laws: And that he might escape the due Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his Crime, he surrendred himself to the mercy of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and took and swore the Oath of the <hi>Test.</hi> By these In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
it doth appear what Qualification is requisite to recommend
one to the Favour of the <hi>Commission.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as we have seen <hi>one part</hi> of the <hi>King's Letter</hi> disobeyed; so
neither was the other regarded, which required the redressing the
<hi>Grievances</hi> which the <hi>Episcopal Ministers</hi> complained of. No Censure
was abated, no Process revised; nor did they recal the <hi>Sentences</hi> of
<hi>Suspension</hi> and <hi>Deposition</hi> pronounced by particular <hi>Presbyteries</hi> and <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods</hi>
against <hi>Ministers,</hi> whom all the World knew to be innocent. But
whether the <hi>Censures</hi> were inflicted justly or unjustly, they continued
them. And to make it evident that some <hi>Episcopal Ministers</hi> had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to complain of <hi>Partiality</hi> and <hi>Injustice,</hi> I shall, instead of many
Instances, which would make me tedious, narrate fully the Case of
<hi>Mr. Simon Cuper Minister at Dumfermlin,</hi> and <hi>Mr. George Iohnson,
Minister of Brunt-Island.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But first I will divert the Reader with an Account of something
which happen'd in <hi>Fife</hi> while this <hi>Commission</hi> was sitting. The noise
of the <hi>King's Two Letters</hi> spread abroad, and the intimation of his
<hi>Favourable Inclinations</hi> towards <hi>Episcopal Ministers</hi> who would own
his <hi>Government,</hi> both alarm'd and awaken'd the <hi>Presbyterian Party,</hi>
and put them upon divers Inventions how to prevent what they so
little desired, and what they thought would prove prejudicial to
them at the last. This was thought the best expedient, which might
keep the <hi>Episcopal Clergy</hi> from owning and submitting to the <hi>Civil
Government,</hi> because it was upon the Hope and Promise of this that
so much favour was procured to them. And to effectuate this, it
was resolved to make use of their <hi>Common Stratagem;</hi> that is, to let
the <hi>Rabble</hi> loose upon such <hi>Ministers</hi> as they would be rid of, and
to fright them from a Compliance. Indeed they have not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted
this Design; But the Attempt upon the <hi>Minister of Kem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back</hi>
in <hi>Fife</hi> is a sufficient Proof of it: an Account of which I have
from one who was present, who upon a mistake was near to have
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:54716:30"/>
suffer'd for the other; and it is as followeth: On <hi>Iuly</hi> the 22, 1691.
about Twelve <hi>a Clock</hi> at night there came two men and knocked at
the <hi>Gate,</hi> of the <hi>Minister of Kembock</hi>'s <hi>House,</hi> desiring a Servant to direct
<hi>Two Strangeer Gentlemen,</hi> who had lost the Road through the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the night. A short while after, they came up to the Chamber
Window, and asked the same Favour in the Name of one <hi>Andrew
Clepan,</hi> a <hi>near Relation</hi> of the <hi>Laird</hi> of <hi>Kembock,</hi> and who belongs
to Major <hi>Balfour's Troop,</hi> which was lying at St. <hi>Andrew</hi>'s some <hi>four
Miles</hi> distant. The <hi>Minister</hi> himself was not at home, for he had gone
the day before to <hi>Angus,</hi> to visit his <hi>Father</hi> who was sick, and there was
only a <hi>deprived Minister</hi> lodging at his <hi>House</hi> at the time. This Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
made them no answer at first, apprehending they were <hi>Rogues</hi>
who were come to rob the House. When therefore their <hi>Lyes</hi> and
fair <hi>Language</hi> proved ineffectual, they began more plainly to
discover themselves, calling at the <hi>Window</hi> to open in the <hi>King</hi> and
<hi>Council's Name,</hi> threatning, if it was not done, to <hi>Pistol</hi> the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
and fire the House about him. Then the <hi>Stranger</hi> answer'd
from within, your Design cannot be just, seeing ye have <hi>twice</hi>
made use of <hi>Lyes;</hi> the <hi>Minister</hi> of <hi>Kembock,</hi> whom you pretend to
seek, is not at home; I am unknown to you, and you do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to search for me, and therefore I entreat you to be gone. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this answer they beat up the <hi>Windows,</hi> fired <hi>Pistols</hi> into the <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
and thrust in their <hi>Swords,</hi> which made the <hi>Stranger</hi> leave his
Bed and run naked out of the <hi>Chamber;</hi> for his Cloaths were so near
the <hi>Window,</hi> that he durst not go to fetch them. Finding the <hi>lowest
Windows</hi> well barred with Iron, they scaled the <hi>House,</hi> and attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to get in at the <hi>upper Windows:</hi> But being disappointed there too,
they next batter'd the <hi>Door</hi> of the House with great <hi>Stones,</hi> and at
last, by frequent pushing with a long <hi>Tree,</hi> or <hi>Pole,</hi> which they found
in the <hi>Closs,</hi> loosed the <hi>Bands,</hi> broke the <hi>Lock,</hi> and forced open the
<hi>Door:</hi> But nevertheless they durst not venture forwards at first,
fearing that he who was within had laid some Snare for them, or
that he was in readiness to kill the first who advanc'd. This made
them with great <hi>Oaths</hi> and <hi>strong Asseverations,</hi> promise safety to his
Person, which somewhat encourag'd him. But as soon as they found
him, they dragg'd him in <hi>his Shirt</hi> to the <hi>Gate,</hi> abusing him with most
opprobrious Language, as <hi>Hell-Hound, S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

them he was not the <hi>Minister</hi> of the place, whom they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to seek, but acknowledged that he was a <hi>Minister</hi> deprived
by the <hi>Council;</hi> and they still supposing otherwise, <hi>Twelve</hi> of them
in <hi>Country Cloths,</hi> with <hi>drawn Swords</hi> and <hi>cocked Pistols,</hi> made him
<hi>twice</hi> kneel, swearing that they would allow him but one minute
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:54716:31"/>
for Prayer; and that all of them were resolved to have the <hi>Honou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of taking his Heart Blood.</hi> But while he was in this <hi>sad Case,</hi> expe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cting
the worst, a <hi>Boy,</hi> whom they called <hi>Guide,</hi> when he perceived
they were in earnest, cryed out vehemently and bitterly, <hi>That man
is not the Minister of this Place, for,</hi> said he, <hi>I know the Minister very
well. Ten</hi> of them upon this went aside to consult the matter, and
return'd with a <hi>Resolution</hi> to let him go, if he would swear never
to preach again. He asked if ever any of them had <hi>Oaths</hi> forced
upon them? <hi>Two</hi> of them answering <hi>Yes;</hi> he asked in the next place,
<hi>if they did keep them;</hi> and they saying, <hi>that they thought they were
not bound to do it:</hi> Then he replyed, <hi>Why would you impose an Oath
upon me, which your selves acknowledge one is not bound to keep?</hi> After
some Communing, they agreed to accept of his <hi>Oath</hi> never to preach
under King <hi>William, nor to pray for him, nor to accept of any Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances
from the General Assembly;</hi> assuring him that it was resolved
<hi>that King</hi> William <hi>'s Letter should never do any good to an Episcopal
Soul-murdering Hell-bound.</hi> Though they spared his Life, yet they
pulled his Shirt <hi>twice</hi> or <hi>thrice</hi> over his Head, and beat his <hi>naked
back</hi> and <hi>Breast</hi> with the <hi>Buts</hi> of their <hi>Musquets:</hi> and before they
parted with him, they sent some of their number to find out the
<hi>Schoolmaster,</hi> and <hi>Church-Beddel,</hi> whom they also threatned and treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
barbarously, to make them deliver the <hi>Keys</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and
swear never more to officiate in it. The <hi>Beddel</hi> hesitating a little,
one of them advanc'd to <hi>pistol him:</hi> and would certainly have done
it, if the <hi>Pistol</hi> had not by a happy Providence misgiven. Then
the <hi>fear of Death</hi> made both him and the <hi>Schoolmaster</hi> do, what was
required of them<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> They declared that they were put upon this by
<hi>Persons</hi> of <hi>the greatest Quality in the Kingdom,</hi> and that they were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to give account of their Diligence to the <hi>Assembly,</hi> that the one
half of their Company was gone to the next <hi>Preaching Episcopal
Minister,</hi> and that it was resolv'd none should escape. As they were
parting, <hi>one</hi> of them said, <hi>It is my Iudgment you should not let this
Fellow pass so easily: Complyers</hi> and <hi>Non-Complyers</hi> should be treated alike.
Upon which a part of them return'd; which the <hi>Minister</hi> perceiving,
went and hid himself in a <hi>Field of Corn</hi> till they were gone, being
all the while in his <hi>Shirt,</hi> for they never allowed him time to put
on his <hi>Cloaths.</hi> What hindred the other Party, or what stop either
of them met with is not known; but afterwards they came not
near any other <hi>Minister.</hi>

               <p>UPon the <hi>third of September,</hi> 1690, The <hi>Ministers</hi> at <hi>Dumferm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi>
were cited to compeir before the <hi>Presbytory</hi> there, the <hi>tenth

them to the <hi>Presbytery,</hi> nor any <hi>Warrant</hi> given by the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery</hi>
for citing them (Mr. <hi>Frazer of Brae,</hi> their <hi>Moderator,</hi> having
declar'd to the Laird of <hi>Pitliver,</hi> and Mr. <hi>George Gray, Minister</hi> at
<hi>Beath,</hi> that he knew nothing of a <hi>Libel</hi> against them, nor of any

that <hi>illegal Citation,</hi> order'd by some <hi>private Cabal,</hi> probably the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilers</hi>
of the <hi>Libels</hi> that were to be given in.</p>
               <p>Whereupon the <hi>Heritours</hi> of the <hi>Parish,</hi> and <hi>Magistrates</hi> of the
<hi>Burgh</hi> formed a <hi>Representation,</hi> and gave it in by some of their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

such Rebuke as the matter deserved; and withal desiring that if
there were any <hi>particular Libels</hi> offer'd against their <hi>Ministers,</hi> or any
of them, the <hi>Presbytery</hi> would be pleased to impart the same to them,
to the effect that they might give <hi>due Information</hi> concerning their
<hi>Ministers,</hi> of their Life, Conversation, and Deportment in their
Charge.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Iames Graham,</hi> one of the <hi>Ministers,</hi> went also to the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,</hi>

made on the <hi>Presbytery's Authority,</hi> and the Injury done
to them, desiring, that at least they would declare that <hi>Citation</hi> void

told him, the <hi>Presbytery</hi> had sustained the <hi>Citation;</hi> Mr. <hi>Graham</hi>
Pleaded that it could not be sustained, being both Informal and Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legal
given without <hi>any order</hi> from the <hi>Presbytery,</hi> Appealing to the

                  <hi>Cited;</hi> and, producing the <hi>Citation</hi> it self, shewed that it was <hi>in prima

while, called; the <hi>Moderator</hi> told him, that though they sustained
the <hi>Citation,</hi> yet, in his favours who had compeired, they passed from
it, and gave him the eighth of <hi>October</hi> to answer to the <hi>Relevancy
of his Libel:</hi> He pleading the same favour to his <hi>Collegue,</hi> it was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely

               <p>That Day Mr. <hi>Simon Cupar,</hi> the other <hi>Minister,</hi> is <hi>cited</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peir

pleaded that the <hi>first Citation</hi> might be declared <hi>null.</hi> Notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of which, the <hi>Presbytery</hi> proceeded and called Mr. <hi>Cupar</hi> before
them; the <hi>Moderator</hi> told him, that by his not answering the <hi>first
Citation,</hi> he had <hi>forfaulted</hi> the <hi>benefit</hi> of objecting against the <hi>Rele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancy</hi>
of the <hi>Libel;</hi> that the <hi>Presbytery</hi> had judged it <hi>relevant,</hi> and
that now he was called to hear and see <hi>Probation</hi> led. Mr. <hi>Cupar</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
That he had not <hi>forfaulted</hi> the <hi>benefit of being heard on the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levancy
of his Libel,</hi> seeing it had been sufficiently represented to
them by his <hi>Collegue</hi> the <hi>last day,</hi> that That <hi>first Citation</hi> was <hi>infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal</hi>
and <hi>illegal;</hi> that his <hi>Collegue</hi> had compeired, not as answering
that <hi>Citation,</hi> but as a <hi>Plaintiff</hi> in both their Names: That the <hi>Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
was previous to any <hi>Libel</hi> offered to, or considered by the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery,</hi>
and without any <hi>Iudicial Order,</hi> or <hi>Warrant</hi> granted by them,
that the <hi>Citation</hi> was to <hi>hear and see himself deposed,</hi> and not to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to the <hi>Relevancy of a Libel;</hi> and therefore he ought as yet to
be heard on that head. The <hi>Moderator</hi> answered, That they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
the <hi>Informality</hi> of the <hi>first Citation,</hi> but sustained the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality</hi>
of it, seeing it had been proved before them, that there was a

He is removed, and, after a little space, called on.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Moderator</hi> makes return, that the <hi>Presbytery</hi> sustained that
<hi>first Citation,</hi> and were resolved now to proceed to the <hi>Examination</hi>
of the <hi>Witnesses.</hi>

                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:54716:32"/>Mr. <hi>Cupar</hi> pleaded, That before they proceeded to <hi>Examine Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,</hi>
he might be allowed to see the <hi>Libel,</hi> and to give in his <hi>Answers</hi>
to it, because <hi>his Answers</hi> might perhaps prevent the necessity of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
any to their <hi>Oaths;</hi> and if any thing should be deponed,
which he could disprove, he behoved either to be debarred from
<hi>just defence,</hi> or an occasion must be given to <hi>contradictory Oaths.</hi> This
was absolutely refused him, only a <hi>double</hi> of the <hi>Libel</hi> is given him;
and the <hi>Moderator</hi> told him, That though immediately after the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position</hi>
of the <hi>Witnesses,</hi> they might proceed to Sentence, yet he
should have the Eighth of <hi>October</hi> to hear the Depositions, and make
answer.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Heritors</hi> pleaded, that, conform to an <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Cupar</hi> might be present at the <hi>Examination</hi> of the <hi>Witnesses,</hi>
(which being denied, alledging that Act reached not <hi>Church-Iudicatories,</hi>)
they protested and took Instrument. Then pleading
that they might be present: This also was denied. Notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
several who were not <hi>Members</hi> of the <hi>Iudicatory,</hi> were admitted.
The <hi>Witnesses,</hi> about thirty, were called; five only compeired at that
time; against whom Mr. <hi>Cupar</hi> objected not: They are sworn; the
rest of the <hi>Witnesses</hi> answered, some that <hi>day,</hi> some on the <hi>morrow;</hi>
Mr. <hi>Cupar</hi> was not called, nor enquired if he had any thing to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
against them: One <hi>Robert Mody,</hi> who had an hand in forming
the <hi>Libel,</hi> officiates as <hi>Clerk</hi> at the deposition of <hi>Witnesses;</hi> whose
<hi>Depositions</hi> were not read over to them, nor they required to subscribe
the same.</p>
               <p>Upon the Second of <hi>October</hi> Mr. <hi>Graham</hi> is <hi>Cited</hi> to the <hi>Eighth, to
hear and see Probation led against him,</hi> and receives a double of his <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,</hi>
notwithstanding the <hi>Presbytery</hi> had allowed him that <hi>day</hi> to be
heard on the <hi>Relevancy</hi> of his <hi>Libel:</hi> An Evidence that the <hi>Citations</hi>
were not ordered by the <hi>Presbytery,</hi> but by the <hi>Libellers.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>October</hi> the Eighth, The <hi>Heritors</hi> and <hi>Magistrates</hi> made a <hi>second
Address</hi> to the <hi>Presbytery,</hi> complaining of their procedure against
their <hi>Ministers,</hi> and bearing an ample <hi>Testimony</hi> of their Life, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
and Deportment in the <hi>Exercise</hi> of their <hi>Ministry,</hi> &amp;c.
Notwithstanding of which they proceeded to call Mr. <hi>Cupar.</hi> The
<hi>Moderator</hi> proposed two Questions to him: <hi>First,</hi> By what Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
he could presume to exercise any Ministerial Office indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
upon them, seeing the Power by which he was Installed, was
dissolved? <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whether or not he owned their <hi>Authority?</hi> And
by another <hi>Minister</hi> it was proposed that he should be charged with
his Absence from the <hi>several Dyets</hi> of the <hi>Presbytery,</hi> since their sitting
at <hi>Dumfermlin.</hi>
               </p>

                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:54716:33"/>Mr. <hi>Cupar</hi> answered, That he came to hear the <hi>Depositions</hi> of the
<hi>Witnesses,</hi> and to make his <hi>Defence,</hi> but understood not the design of
these <hi>Questions,</hi> seeing by the <hi>Laws</hi> of the Land he was <hi>in bona fide,</hi>
to exercise his <hi>Ministerial Function,</hi> and had not hitherto declined
<hi>their Iudicatory.</hi> Hereupon the <hi>Heritors</hi> gave in <hi>another Paper;</hi> in
which, narrating their former <hi>Representation,</hi> and their <hi>Address</hi> that
day, with the <hi>Presbytery's</hi> slighting of both, they protested against
the <hi>Presbytery's</hi> further procedure; and did <hi>Appeal</hi> from them to the
General Assembly ensuing: Upon several <hi>grounds</hi> therein contained,
which being read, and <hi>Instruments</hi> taken. Mr. <hi>Cupar</hi> did in his own
Name also <hi>Appeal</hi> from them to the said <hi>Assembly,</hi> upon the Reasons
contained in the <hi>Heritor's Appeal,</hi> and others, which he reserved liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to himself more largely to propose.</p>
               <p>About an Hour after they sent for Mr. <hi>Cupar;</hi> the <hi>Moderator</hi> told
him, the <hi>Presbytery</hi> had considered his <hi>Process,</hi> and had referred the
same to the <hi>General Assembly;</hi> and in the mean time they did prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
him to exercise any <hi>ministerial Office,</hi> until the Meeting of the said
<hi>Assembly,</hi> without giving any ground on which they founded such a
<hi>Censure.</hi> Mr. <hi>Cupar</hi> told them, he thought strange of that <hi>Step</hi> of their
<hi>procedure,</hi> that after <hi>Appeals</hi> and the <hi>Process</hi> referred by themselves,
they should proceed to <hi>Sentence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About six a Clock Mr. <hi>Graham</hi> is called; he complained that
though the <hi>Presbytery</hi> had given him that Day to be heard on the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levancy</hi>
of his <hi>Libel;</hi> yet he had received a <hi>Citation</hi> to hear and see
<hi>Probation led.</hi> The Moderator disown'd that <hi>Citation,</hi> and offered to
burn it. Tomorrow at nine a Clock is assigned him, and the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
are <hi>apud act a</hi> cited to the same <hi>Dyet.</hi> After he had been heard
on the <hi>Articles</hi> of his <hi>Libel,</hi> the <hi>Relevancy</hi> of it is referred to the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral

which, and the fore-named Scandals, the generality of the serious

               <head>His ANSWER.</head>
               <p>TO the <hi>First</hi> and <hi>Fifth</hi> Articles, bearing his persecuting Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
by his sending Elders to inform against them, and his sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegious
robbing the <hi>Poor</hi> to carry on his <hi>Persecution.</hi> This is utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
false, and is not so much as probable, that the Elders should be
sent on that Errand, or that they would go. The only ground of
this is, That in the Yearâ€”all the Elders were summoned to

the <hi>Circuit Court</hi> held at <hi>Sterlin.</hi> The Elders complained of this Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den;
and application being made to some then in power, that they
might be freed of that trouble, it was answered, That the ordinary
course of such Jud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>catories required it; but that <hi>two</hi> or <hi>three</hi> might go
in the Name of the rest: Which being represented to the Elders
three are condescended on, <hi>viz. Iohn Cupar, Thomas Steinson,</hi> and
<hi>Iohn Main,</hi> the rest, each one contributing eight Shillings <hi>Scots</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fray
their Expences.</p>
               <p>To the <hi>Second,</hi> The Parioch of <hi>Dumfermlin</hi> extends on every side,
two Miles from the Town, in some Corners three: It consists of
above two thousand seven hundred examinable persons; every Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the Town is visited ordinarily once a year, and twice examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
the Landward is divided into upwards of twenty Districts.</p>
               <p>These are visited twice a year, and all persons capable are conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to be examined on the principles of Religion, the Duties of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,
and relative Duties are particularly recommended, besides on
all accidental Occasions of Baptism, Marriage, Difference in Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
or between Neighbours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they are particularly treated with
in private. The Sick, upon notice given, are carefully attended,
and the Scriptures explained, sometimes in larger, sometimes in lesser
portions.</p>
               <p>To the <hi>Third</hi> and <hi>Fourth,</hi> all due Endeavours are used to debar scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
and notarly vicious persons from the Lord's Supper: The Elders
are Men of as unquestionable Integrity as any of their Quality in the
Parioch; at least nothing to the contrary, of either Communicants
or Elders, was ever privately or publickly signified to him. Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
has been carefully and impartially exercised.</p>
               <p>To the <hi>Sixth,</hi> His entrance to the Charge was by presentation of
the Heretors and Magistrates, the then undoubted <hi>Patrons;</hi> his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
was legal and approved, by the favourable reception of the

               <head>Indictment and Libel against Mr. James Graham, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent

               <p>THat whereas by several <hi>Acts</hi> of the <hi>General Assemblies</hi> of this <hi>Church,</hi>
and consonant to the Word of God, and in particular by Act

to their Demerits, by the respective Presbyteries in which they
live. And it being of verity, that the said Mr. <hi>Iames Graham</hi>

the Parioch of <hi>Dumfermlin,</hi> by presentation of the Patron, Collation,
and Institution of the Prelate, and that against the Consent of the
generality of the godly and serious Persons within the said Parioch;
and that the said Mr. <hi>Graham</hi> has in all things joyned and complied
with, and assisted Prelacy contrary to the Word of God, establish'd
Laws of this Church, and the Land's solemn Engagements thereto, and
his taking of Declarations and Canonical Oaths, has testified his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrigibleness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That he hath been supinely negligent, contrary to 1 <hi>Tim.</hi>
3. 2. As, 1. That he doth not visit Families ministerially. Nor, 2.
Hath not privately and personally stirred up the People to the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Holiness. 3. In neglecting to visit the Sick. 4. That he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
to lecture or to explain the Scriptures, according to the Order of
the General Assembly for that effect. 5. That he Catechises not,
according to the Larger and Shorter Catechisms. 6. That he takes
no notice of <hi>Quakers</hi> in his Parioch, who exercise all the Duties

                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That he hath horribly prophaned the Ordinance of the
Lord's Supper, by his admitting of unclean Persons to that holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.
2. That he hath admitted and keeps on his Session very
scandalous Elders, some of which are Tiplers, others Swearers, and
the most part ignorant, and Neglecters of the Worship of God, in
their Families, Prophaners of the Sabbath.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That he takes no notice of Persons publickly prophaning
the Sabbath-day, in the Town and about it, by dighting of their
Beer to the Pot, bringing in of Water and Kail, and their Walking,
Drinking, and Caballing; Children's playing (and his own among
the rest) and that in a constant course; which is not unknown to
him, at least should not be, being so publickly acted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That he hath not brought several scandalous Persons, such
as Adulterers, Fornicators, and others, nor so much as endeavoured
to bring them to Repentance, nor to undergo just Censure in order
thereunto; for Proof of which, the Session-Book is required.</p>
               <p>For all which, and sundry others not express'd, he is justly cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surable;
and therefore it is humbly craved, that the Brethren of the
Presbytery of <hi>Dumfermlin</hi> would take cognisance of the same; and
being found guilty thereof, that the Presbytery may inflict such Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
as in their godly Wisdoms they shall think meet: And that he
may be examined upon his Doctrine and Sufficiency, is desired by
<hi>Andrew Rolland</hi> of <hi>Gask,</hi> and <hi>William Smith,</hi> in <hi>Dumfermlin,</hi> in Name
of several Presbyterians in <hi>Dumfermlin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Life and Conversation of these two Ministers, were so inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
and exemplary, that there was not the least Pretext of charging
any Immorality upon them, nor any Crime, but what was forged by
Ignorance and Malice: Wherefore their <hi>Libels</hi> were adduced as a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
and particular Proof, to shew how unjust and ridiculous the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian
Clergy are towards such as are of another Persuasion; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when it was requir'd to try Mr. <hi>Graham</hi> in his Doctrine and
Sufficiency; a Person whom all know to be an able Divine and an
eminent Scholar. It happened that some carried these Libels to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
where the matter was represented to a certain Person of Quality,
a great Friend and Prop to the Presbyterian Party and Interest; and
he was so set upon for this, that he thought himself obliged to write
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:54716:35"/>
to the leading Men of his Party in <hi>Scotland,</hi> to meddle no more with
the Ministers of <hi>Dumfermlin,</hi> because it was made a great Objection
against them. This was the Cause why the Process against Mr. <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
was let fall: But though there was the same Reason to right
Mr. <hi>Cupar,</hi> yet because the Sentence was already past against him, they
would not re-call it, as if all their Acts were of the nature of the Laws of

and from one Session of the Commission, he was put off to
another, with this Excuse only, That they had no leisure, for other Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness,
to consider his Case. At last, Mr. <hi>Cupar</hi> being wearied with so
long and so frequent attendance, and finding his Parioch grudging
the want of his Ministry, at their importunity he has returned to
the exercise of his Ministry, the Presbyterians not being able to
oppose or hinder it, unless by the <hi>French</hi> method of Dragooning
the Parioch.</p>

               <p>IT having been humbly represented to the Reverend Presbytery,

there shall be occasion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> As to the said Mr. <hi>George</hi> his entry to his pretended Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry.
It was by Episcopal Ordination, Presentation, and Collation,
and which obliged him to take Declarations, Oaths of Allegiance,
Supremacy, and Canonical Obedience, which are contradictory to
our National Engagements, and inconsistent with <hi>Presbyterian</hi> P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
which hath involved in them Persecutions and bloody Cruelty,
that hath been exercised upon <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> these by-gone Years, nor
have we heard ever of any resentment he ever had or hath
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:54716:36"/>
thereof till this day, whatever length he may now come to, to secure
his Benefice; yea, we are obliged to judge him the same Man he was,
seeing he keeps at his old forms of singing the Doxology, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nor
can there any change be seen upon him from what he was: And how
in this case <hi>Presbyterians</hi> can submit to his Ministry, we cannot
see.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to his entry at <hi>Brunt-Island,</hi> it then gave great g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>

of Jealousie, that he was a Man of bad Principles, and Jesutically in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd;
for having bee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap> Curare at <hi>Fala,</hi> and having been deserted
of that People, and they deserted of him, he was dispensed with
by the Earl of <hi>Perth,</hi> Chancellor, and others of our Arbitrary Rulers,
anent the Test that time imposed; and the said Earl of <hi>Perth,</hi> and
that <hi>Cabal,</hi> then being his Patrons, they did by the Earl of <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
procure for him a Presentation to the Benefice of <hi>Brunt-Island</hi>
(being then vacant, and the King Patron) till a more eminent place
should be provided for him; which at that time gave great Offence
to all sorts of people here; and which yet more encreaseth this Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louse,
not only of the <hi>Presbyterian Party,</hi> but even of his own Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
the Curats of their Meeting at <hi>Kirkaldie:</hi> for without ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
that Meeting, upon his obtained Presentation, he received
his Institution from one single Neighbor Curate (by what Authority
is unknown to us) who came and gave him the Keys of the Church-Doors
and Bell-tows, as Symbols of possessing his Benefice; which
was so received by that Meeting, that they then judg'd his Practice
irregular, and this Man who used it, to be of bad Principles; for
which they resolv'd to disown him for a Brother, and (for any
thing known to us) they continue in the same mind still, having
hitherto heard nothing of their further Brotherly Correspondence;
so that at his Entry here, he was under a very bad Character.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Jealousie mentioned (not without just Ground) of
his unsound Principles and Practices, is so universally entertain'd,
and hath taken such impression amongst all that are <hi>Presbyterian</hi> in
that Congregation, that there can be no ground to expect that his
Ministry can do good in that place, though it were submitted to
(as it never will be) by the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> in that <hi>Parish.</hi> It must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
certainly be very inconvenient (if not unjust) to force
him upon us, or to require or expect our Submission in this Case
to a Man's Ministry we have such Resentments of, and Reluctancy
against, as is exprest.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:54716:36"/>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Since his Settlement here, his Negligence in his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterial
Work hath been visible to all: For except upon Invitation to
visit sick persons, we know no Ministerial Work he hath performed,
except his custom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>y preaching, which he must perform for his
Hire; and in those Visits, be the Persons never so ignorant, he sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
(if eve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>) fails to find them in that good Case, as to assure
them of Heaven, and so sooths them in their Sins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But as to
any other part of the Ministerial Work, in Visitation of Families
or Examination (though he hath been near two years incumbent
here,) there is no shadow of Account can be given, until the Act
for settling of Presbyterian Government was past; wherein he and
his Adherents finding his supine Negligence in this would readily
meet him. To prevent this hazard, he goes about to take up a
Roll in the Parish in order to Examination: And even in this
last he hath made some discovery of himself: for in his Circuit
of his coming to some of the Presbyterian's House to enquire their
Names, and interrogating if they used to come to Church. It was
answered, they did not; for being <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> they waited on the
Ordinances of the Meeting House; which he affirmed was their
great Sin: and it being replyed to that, That they judged it no Sin,
but a Duty: He asserted it to be their greatest Sin, and so left
them: and if what is said infer not Insufficiency, we know not
what will.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> His unconcernedness in matters of Scandal seems also
to infer, both Negligence and Scandal against him; whereof Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
hath lately afforded us a sufficient Instance while he was
Curate in <hi>Fala.</hi> A Scandal of an Adultery in the Parish of <hi>Dalkeith,</hi>
pursu'd before the Session there, and the persons guilty, being contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macious,
it was by a Reference brought to their Presbytery (such
as it was) where he was a Member<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and from them to the Bishop
and his Synod, where he was a Witness to the whole Process, which
is very dextrously conducted, and the Guilt fully and clearly instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted;
so that the Scandal was manifestly notair to him. But so
little was his Zeal and Tenderness, that though the Adulterer, hath
as a Stranger being valetudinary, lived in <hi>Brunt-Island</hi> ever since
Mr. <hi>Iohnston</hi> came here, unknown to any Person but to him; yet
he never made discovery of him to any Person, but suffered him
of late to be m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>rried (though under Suspicion also to be married
to another Woman at <hi>London</hi>) without any Intimation of the Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal:
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:54716:37"/>
but a little after, upon an emergent, the Magistrates of <hi>Brunt-Island,</hi>
finding it their Duty to enquire after that Scandal, and
making their Application to the Incumbent at <hi>Dalkeith,</hi> he gave
them a full account of the Process, and produced very freely to
them the Session and the Presbytery Books; where they saw the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
very clearly instructed, where that incumbent did exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
marvel, that Mr. <hi>Iohnston,</hi> that had been a Witness to this whole
Process, had past over this matter; and did then write a Letter
or Declaration anent that Business, and directed it to the Magistrates
and Ministers of <hi>Brunt-Island</hi> to be looked after, which was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
to Mr. <hi>Iohnston</hi> by the Magistrates, and he urged to publish
the same by them, that the people might be upon their Guard and
know how to carry towards him; which with the advice of his
Adherents he refused to do.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> The Presbyterian Party here (as in other places) ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
for Conscience sake been fined, persecuted, and born down for
Non-complyance with Prelatical Courses, carried on by such In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
these years by-past; and having had this Yoke of Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
thus wreathed about their Necks, could not but in all reason
and Justice expect, that when the Lord should return to have
mercy upon Zion, and put the Government of his House in the
Hands of his own Servants, to manage the Affairs of his Church,
that we should be eased of this unsupportable Burthen. And can
it be supposed any feigned submission <hi>Mr. Iohnston</hi> can now give
for this World's sake, can either satisfie our Consciences, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade
us of his Sincerity in this matter, whose Principles have been
to follow Courses to maintain that wicked Hieratchy? Nor can
it be suppos'd the Reverend Presbytery, who have it in their Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to ease us of this Burthen, will instead thereof wreath this Yoke
yet upon our Necks, and thereby sink us under it, and make our
Bondage yet more grievous to be born.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> The Presbyterian Party in the Parish are all Unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
never to submit to <hi>Mr. Iohnston</hi>'s Ministry, nor to own him in
that Station, whatever may be the Event; and if the gratifying of
him and his Adherents in this matter be the way to secure and
settle Presbyterian Government, it may easily be conjectured, when
it is considered, that there is no Person for him who is not an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
openly declared in Judgment and Practice against Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery;
which but corresponds to <hi>Mr. Iohnston</hi>'s own Declaration
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:54716:37"/>
and Judgment in his Case; for when Summons were given him
to appear before this Reverend Presbytery, he did even then disown
their Authority, affirming he would not appear before them, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
another Presbytery of his own, to whom he would answer,
but not to them; or he would answer to the Council.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eighthly,</hi> It is not to be doubted but a disappointment in this
matter, will occasion such a rupture amongst us, as will not be easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
healed; And what the end or event of that may be, who can
tell? Nor can it be expected or judged just, to impose upon us the
keeping up of a Meeting-House to prevent other inconveniences,
since there is a Legal Maintainance due to the Faithful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
there, in whose Ministry the Presbyterians there pretend the
largest share.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ninthly,</hi> How can it be supposed that this Man is of Presbyterian
Principles, or a Friend or Well-wisher to the late Happy Change
in the Government of Church and State, since all his Familiarity is
with such as are well known to be Friends to neither; nor have we
an instance of any thing done by him to signifie his satisfaction with
the Change, except his Praying for K. W. and Q. M. which is not
doubted was done by Advice to keep off a present stroke: And it
was observed, and generally talked of, when he was ordered to read
that Proclamation for Praying for their Majesties, he did read it, but
with that contempt in his reading, sitting on his bottom and mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, that his manner of reading of it made many think there was
more contempt in doing thereof, than if he had forborn it. And
such like there having been a Sol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>mn Day of Thanksgiving appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to be kept, and a Proclamation issued out from the Convention
of Estates for that effect; for his own security, he preached one Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
that Day, but spoke not one word to the occasion of it. As
also, there being of late a Solemn Day of Humiliation to be kept,
by appointment of Parliament and general meeting of Ministers,
for Happy Success in the King's Expedition for <hi>Ireland,</hi> &amp;c. he
preached that Day, but was so general and unconcerned, as no
hearer could have judged, by his discourse, one Sentence in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
relating to the occasion, which cannot but give a discovery of
the Man's Spirit and Principles by which he is led, whatever he may
pretend to the contrary: And it is no wonder to see him contemn
Authority, who affirms neither Church nor State to be right.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:54716:38"/>
                  <hi>Tenthly,</hi> How true a Friend he is to the Protestant Religion and
Protestants for its sake, may be conjectured by his Charity to the
poor banished Protestants, who were lately forced to fly from <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi>
For there having been a publick Collection appointed to be
gathered for their necessary Supply, he not only neglected to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
the Appointment to his Hearers, and press them to that Duty
of Charity; but it was commonly said, he used all the means he
could to dissuade such as he had influence upon to contribute any
thing in that Charitable Supply; and the event was answerable to
his design and desire, for nothing was collected in that Church for
that use; nor did any Person, within his Association, contribute one
Farthing thereto.</p>
               <p>From what is said, it may appear what just grounds there are for
trying Mr. <hi>Iohnston</hi> anent his pretended Ministry, and the Exercise
of it at <hi>Brunt-Island;</hi> which is left to the Reverend Presbytery's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,
and their definite Sentence for his removal from amongst
us, as to his pretended Ministry, is humbly expected and waited
for.</p>
               <p>This is given with Protestation to add further, as there shall be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion:
And beside all that is said, Mr. <hi>Pitcairn</hi> was called to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry
of <hi>Brunt-Island,</hi> and appointed by the Synod of <hi>Fife</hi> to serve
there long before Mr. <hi>Iohnston</hi>'s intrusion amongst us, so that
Mr. <hi>Iohnston</hi> can have no just pretence.</p>

               <head>Remarks upon the foresaid LIBEL, given in against
Mr. GEO. JOHNSTON.</head>
               <p>THE <hi>First</hi> Article will be confessed, and none, except the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
composers of the Libel, will have the worse opinion of
Mr. <hi>Iohnston</hi> on that account.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Second,</hi> it may be said, That Mr. <hi>Iohnston</hi> might as well
take a Presentation from K. <hi>Iames,</hi> who was undoubted Patron of
the Church of <hi>Brunt-Island,</hi> as the Presbyterians an Indulgence from
the same King; the one is no Crime, the other cannot be well justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
because contrary to standing Laws, and because they knew the
Design was to make way for Popery, which Mr. <hi>Iohnston</hi> is less a
Friend to, than the Presbyterians are. Whereas it was said, That he
was deserted of the People of <hi>Fala,</hi> the contrary is very well known,
for that People had a great love to him, and he was in good esteem
amongst them: They expressed a great deal of regret when he par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from them; and if there were any who ran to the Presbyterian
meeting-house while he was there, they were very few, and very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable.
His manner of Institution to the Church of <hi>Brunt-Island,</hi>
was not singular, nor yet irregular, according to the practice of
the Church, and can be no reasonable prejudice against him. Nor
is it true, That the other Ministers of that Presbytery disowned him;
for they always did, and still do, entertain a Brotherly Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
with him.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Third,</hi> It might have been true, That the <hi>Presbyterians</hi>
entertained a Jealousie of him; and their groundless Jealousie might
have raised a Prejudice against his Ministry: But notwithstanding of
that, Mr. <hi>Iohnston</hi> is very capable of doing good in that Parioch, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Presbyterians are not near the number of the People of
another Persuasion, who love <hi>Mr. Iohnston</hi>'s Person, and are so very
well pleased with his <hi>Ministry,</hi> that they have testified a great deal of
Concernment for him.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Fourth,</hi> All that know <hi>Mr. Iohnston,</hi> know that he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
Conscience of discharging the Duty of a <hi>Minister;</hi> so that he
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:54716:39"/>
cannot be liable to censure upon this Head; except amongst ignorant
and malicious Persons, his Omissions will be found very pardonable:
And what is there given as an instance, is to be ascribed to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
of the Times<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> rather than to any neglect of his. It is indeed a
little strange to see an Episcopal <hi>Minister</hi> accused by Presbyterians, for
encouraging Persons with assurance of Heaven, without pressing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
upon them; for the Presbyterian <hi>Ministers</hi> are known to be
much more guilty of this: And the only Reason why the Vulgar use
to be more affected with the Visits of Presbyterian <hi>Ministers,</hi> than
with the Visits of Episcopal <hi>ones,</hi> is, That the Discourses of the
one goes all upon Comfort, and the other mostly on Duty: It is
the practice of the Episcopal Clergy, first, to press Faith, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and Obedience to the Laws of God, and to give hopes of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
only upon these terms; which, being somewhat hard to Flesh
and Blood, therefore some choose the Presbyterian way of it, which
is more easie, but certainly not so safe.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Fifth,</hi> The scandalous Person there spoken of, was living
in <hi>Brunt-Island</hi> before Mr. <hi>Iohnston</hi> came to it, and had joyned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to the Presbyterian Meeting-House, so that he was never under
Mr. <hi>Iohnston</hi>'s cure; and considering the Indulgence given, then to
those of that Persuasion, there was no Obligation on Mr. <hi>Iohnston</hi>
to take notice of one who belonged not to his Congregation. The
Banns of Marriage, were proclaimed in the Meeting-house, and he
was Married by the Presbyterian Minister; and therefore, if the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
him to be married was a Fault, it cannot be charged upon
Mr. <hi>Iohnston.</hi> The emergent which, they say, put the Magistrates
of <hi>Brunt-Island</hi> upon their Duty to enquire after this scandal, was
only some difference that fell out betwixt them and him; whereby
it is evident, that their prosecuting of scandal proceeds more often
from a Pique, than from any sense of the Sin.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sixth</hi> Article is Trueblue Presbyterian, and if it be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
as relevant, the whole Episcopal Clergy must be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missed.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Seventh,</hi> whatever be the Resolutions of the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
Party, it is the concerted Resolution of the Episcopal Party
to own <hi>Mr. Iohnson,</hi> and to adhere to him. It is no more just
to satisfie the one than the other, and it is reasonable that the lesser
number yield to the greater.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:54716:39"/>The <hi>Eighth</hi> is very unjust, for the accidental Inconvenience which
some bring upon themselves, is no good reason for the taking away
ones Legal Rights and just Possession.</p>
               <p>There is nothing in the other remaining Articles but uncertain
Sur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ises and uncharitable Constructions; and therefore this very
Libel is a great Demonstration of <hi>Mr. Iohnston</hi>'s Innocence. For
when no real Crime could be objected against him, by these whose
M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>lice prompted them to do it, if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap> the least ground
for it, it is evident, that his Depo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

and consequently the Presbytery most unjust who su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spended
him, and the Commission of the General Assembly no
less, who refused to repone him, and redress the Wrong<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

being very sensible of the Injury which both he and they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
resolved to do themselves right; and so they met, gave
<hi>Mr. Iohnston</hi> a new Call, and put him in Possession again of the
Church, declaring that they will maintain him in it by a strong
Hand. And there can be no reason given why this way of pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessing
Ministers should not stand and be justified as well as the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possessing
and turning them out by a Rabble. The Presbyterians
fret very much at this, as they have reason, because it shakes one
of the pretended Pillars of their Kirk, <hi>viz.</hi> The Inclinations of the
People; and therefore they have taken out Council-Letters, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
them to deliver up the Keys of the Church.</p>
