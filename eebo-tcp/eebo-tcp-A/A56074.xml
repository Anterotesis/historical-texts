            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PROTEST OF THE <hi>City of Amſterdam,</hi> In Oppoſition to The States of Holland: Who Pretend to raiſe 16000 New Levies, by Plurality of Voices, CONTRARY TO The Immunities and Priviledges Granted Them By <hi>MARY</hi> Counteſs of <hi>HOLLAND,</hi> BEING A MANIFEST VIOLATION OF THEIR <hi>Vndoubted Liberties.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE Burgomaſters and Council of <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> being informed by their Deputies belonging to the Aſſembly of the States Provincial, that the 31th of <hi>January</hi> laſt, by Plurality of Voices, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their Deputies Oppoſition; The ſaid States Provincial had formed a pretended Concluſion, as if that Province had conſented to the Raiſing of 16000 Men; are Neceſſitated to declare againſt ſuch Irregulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, both in matter and form, having often declared the contrary, and ſhewn Reaſons for their Diſſent; Alledging it better to Obtain a ſpeedy Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> for the Repoſe of <hi>Europe</hi>: eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, Conſidering the moſt <hi>Pagan</hi> Enemy Advancing to revenge the Affronts of the laſt Campagn, and that the raiſing of new Levies can no ways Faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litate an Accord between the two Crowns; but rather be a Means to cauſe his Catholick Majeſty to rely the more thereupon, and his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty to be Exaſperated, and thereby not only engage the States General, and by Conſequence, <hi>England,</hi> into a moſt bloody War.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:59930:2"/>That they were refuſed a Conference, <hi>May</hi> 15. 1683. although they had declared their Intentions, not only to the Court of <hi>Spain</hi>; but alſo, to the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> that the States Provincial proceed to a Concluſion without any Regard to the Fundamental deſign of the Government, conformable to which all the Antient Mazerines and Cuſtoms in the time of the Earls Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, were with the greateſt Zeal put in Execution againſt ſuch as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringed the ſame.</p>
            <p>And among the Reſolutions of the States Provincial, <hi>March</hi> 11. 1681. It was Concluded, That no Member whether of the Nobility or Gentry, ſhould be Concluded by a Plurality of Voices, againſt their Wills, in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of concern, which Reſolutions are purſuant to the Rights and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges Confirmed to <hi>Holland</hi> in the time of the Earls Government.</p>
            <p>But, by raiſing of New Levies thus, the leſſer Number will ſtand equal with the greater; eſpecially, in matters of Taxes, which always was by their Predeceſſors lookt upon to be a thing of ſo great Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; that they could never be perſwaded to admit thereof, though in the greateſt danger of this Republick, and Concurrence of two Thirds of the States in the ſame.</p>
            <p>They alſo declared that they could not hold their Seſſions in that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Aſſembly, if they might not remain Unmoleſted in their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Liberty, and have an Intire Freedom, to conſent or not, in matters of Taxes, upon which the Welfare of their Cities depended, and of which none but themſelves could be Competent Judges, and if Plurality of Voices could carry it, it was the only way to ruine them.</p>
            <p>Upon Concluſion, in the year 1681. 'twas Corroborated by a Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the Members of the States, the ſecond and third of <hi>October</hi> 1671. That it was not in the Power of a Plurality of Voices (with Right) to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a matter where the Plurality of Voices cannot take place, which if they ſhould allow, it would Alter and Subvert the Fundamental Conſtitution of the Government, and thereby raiſe Taxes at their Pleaſure, which not in the leaſt is to be Admitted.</p>
            <p>For which Reaſons, the preſent Burgo-Maſters and Councel, Declare the aforeſaid Concluſion, of the Provincial State, to be Null and Void; and Declares, That they will Adhere to this Sentiment, and not Contribute any thing towards the Charge of the ſaid Levies, of 16000.</p>
