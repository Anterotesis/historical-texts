            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:160234:3"/>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Diſcoverer never travelled far for it, but in <hi>March</hi> 1644. he had ſome ſeven or eight of that horrible ſect of Witches living in the Towne where he lived, a Towne in <hi>Eſſex</hi> called <hi>Maningtree,</hi> with divers other adjacent Witches of other towns, who every ſix weeks in the night (being alwayes on the Friday night) had their meeting cloſe by his houſe, and had their ſeverall ſolemne ſacrifices there offered to the <hi>Devill,</hi> one of which this diſcoverer heard ſpeaking to her <hi>Imps</hi> one night, and bid them goe to another Witch, who was thereupon apprehended, and ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched by women who had for many yeares knowne the Devills marks, and found to have three teats about her, which honeſt women have not: ſo upon command from the <hi>Juſtice,</hi> they were to keep her from ſleep two or three nights, expecting in that time to ſee her <hi>familiars,</hi> which the fourth night ſhe called in by their ſeverall names, and told them what ſhapes, a quarter of an houre before they came in, there being ten of us in the roome, the firſt ſhe called was</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Holt,</hi> who came in like a white kitling.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Jarmara,</hi> who came in like a fat Spaniel without any legs at all, ſhe ſaid ſhe kept him fat, for ſhe clapt her hand on her belly, and ſaid he ſuckt good blood from her body.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Vinegar Tom,</hi> who was like a long-legg'd Greyhound, with an head like an Oxe, with a long taile and broad eyes, who when this diſcoverer ſpoke to, and bade him goe to the place provided for him and his Angels, immediately transformed himſelfe into the ſhape of a child of foure yeeres old without a head, and gave halfe a dozen turnes about the houſe, and vaniſhed at the doore.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Sack and Sugar,</hi> like a black Rabbet.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Newes, like a Polcat. All theſe vaniſhed away in a little time. Immediately after this Witch confeſsed ſeverall other Witches, from whom ſhe had her <hi>Imps,</hi> and named to divers wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men where their marks were, the number of their <hi>Marks,</hi> and <hi>Imps,</hi> and <hi>Imps</hi> names, as <hi>Elemauzer, Pyewacket, Peckin the Crown, Grizzel Greedigut, &amp;c.</hi> which no mortall could invent; and upon their ſearches the ſame Markes were found, the ſame number, and in the ſame place, and the like confeſſions from them of the ſame Imps, (though they knew not that we were told before) and ſo
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:160234:3"/>
peached one another thereabouts that joyned together in the like damnable practiſe, that in our Hundred in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> 29. were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned at once, 4. brought 25. Miles to be hanged, where this Diſcoverer lives, for ſending the Devill like a Beare to kill him in his garden, ſo by ſeeing diverſe of the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Papps, and trying wayes with hundreds of them, he gained this experience, and for ought he knowes any man elſe may find them as well as he and his company, if they had the ſame skill and experience.</p>
            <p>Quer. 5. <hi>Many poore People are condemned for having a Pap, or Teat about them, whereas many People (eſpecially antient People) are, and have been a long time troubled with naturall wretts on ſeverall parts of their bodies, and other naturall excreſſencies, as Hemerodes, Piles, Childbearing, &amp;c. and theſe ſhall be judged only by one man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and a woman, and ſo accuſed or acquitted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw,</hi> The parties ſo judging can juſtifie their skill to any, and ſhew good reaſons why ſuch markes are not meerly naturall, neither that they can happen by any ſuch naturall cauſe as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore expreſsed, and for further anſwer for their private judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments alone, it is moſt falſe and untrue, for never was any man tryed by ſearch of his body, but commonly a dozen of the ableſt men in the pariſh or elſe where, were preſent, and moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly as many ancient skilfull matrons and midwives preſent when the women are tryed, which marks not only he, and his company atteſt to be very ſuſpitious, but all beholders, the skilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of them, doe not approve of them, but likewiſe aſsent that ſuch tokens cannot in their judgements proceed from any the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove mentioned Cauſes.</p>
            <p>Quer. 6. <hi>It is a thing impoſsible for any man or woman to judge rightly on ſuch marks, they are ſo neare to naturall excreſſencies, and they that finde them, durſt not preſently give Oath they were drawne by evill ſpirits, till they have uſed unlawfull courſes of torture to make them ſay any thing for caſe and quiet, as who would not do? but I would know the reaſons he ſpeakes of, how, and whereby to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the one from the other, and ſo be ſatisfied in that.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The reaſons in breefe are three, which for the preſent he judgeth to differ from naturall marks; which are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1. He judgeth by the unuſualnes of the place where he findeth the teats in or on
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:160234:4"/>
their bodies, being farre diſtant from any uſuall place, from whence ſuch naturall markes proceed, as if a witch plead the markes found are Emerods, if I finde them on the bottome of the back-bone, ſhall I aſs<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> with him, knowing they are not neere that veine, and ſo others by child-bearing, when it may be they are in the contrary part?</p>
            <p n="2">2. They are moſt commonly inſenſible, and feele neither pin, needle, aule, &amp;c. thruſt through them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The often variations and mutations of theſe marks into ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall formes, confirmes the matter; as if a Witch hear a month or two before that the <hi>Witch-finder</hi> (as they call him) is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, they will, and have put out their Imps to others to ſuckle them, even to their owne young and tender children; theſe upon ſearch are found to have dry skinnes and filmes only, and be cloſe to the fleſh, keepe her 24. houres with a diligent eye, that none of her Spirits come in any viſible ſhape to ſuck her; the women have ſeen the next day after her Teats extended out to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer filling length, full of corruption ready to burſt, and leaving her alone then one quarter of an houre, and let the women go up againe, and ſhee will have them drawn by her Imps cloſe againe: <hi>Probatum eſt.</hi> Now for anſwer to their tortures in its due place.</p>
            <p>Quer. 7. <hi>How can it poſſibly be that the Devill being a ſpirit, and wants no nutriment or ſuſtentation, ſhould deſire to ſuck any blood? and indeed as he is a spirit he cannot draw any ſuch excreſſences, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving neither fleſh nor bone, nor can be felt, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> He ſeekes not their bloud, as if he could not ſubſiſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that nouriſhment, but he often repairs to them, and gets it, the more to aggravate the Witches damnation, and to put her in mind of her <hi>Covenant:</hi> and as he is a Spirit and Prince of the ayre, he appeares to them in any ſhape whatſoever, which ſhape is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by him through joyning of condenſed thickned aire to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and many times doth aſsume ſhapes of many creatures; but to create any thing he cannot do it, it is only proper to God: But in this caſe of drawing out of theſe Teats, he doth really en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the body, reall, corporeall, ſubſtantiall creature, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth that Creature (he working in it) to his deſired ends, and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the organs of that body to ſpeake withall to make his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:160234:4"/>
up with the Witches, be the creature Cat, Rat, Mouſe, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Quer. 8. <hi>When theſe Paps are fully diſcovered, yet that will not ſerve ſufficiently to convict them, but they muſt be tortured and kept from ſleep two or three nights, to diſtract them, and make them ſay any thing; which is a way to tame a wilde Colt, or Hawke, &amp;c.</hi>

               <hi>Anſ.</hi> In the infancy of this diſcovery it was not only thought fitting, but enjoyned in <hi>Eſſex</hi> and <hi>Suffolke</hi> by the Magiſtrates, with this intention only, becauſe they being kept awake would be more the active to cal their Imps in open view the ſooner to their helpe, which oftentimes have ſo happened; and never or ſeldome did any Witch ever complaine in the time of their keeping for want of reſt, but after they had beat their heads together in the Goale; and after this uſe was not allowed of by the Judges and other Magiſtrates, it was never ſince uſed, which is a yeare and a halfe ſince, neither were any kept from ſleep by any order or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection ſince; but peradventure their own ſtubborne wills did not let them ſleep, though tendered and offered to them.</p>
            <p>Quer. 9. <hi>Beſide that unreaſonable watching, they were extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily walked, till their feet were bliſtered, and ſo forced through that cruelty to confeſſe, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> It was in the ſame beginning of this diſcovery, and the meaning of walking of them at the higheſt extent of cruelty, was only they to walke about themſelves the night they were watched, only to keepe them waking: and the reaſon was this, when they did lye or ſit in a chaire, if they did offer to couch downe, then the watchers were only to deſire them to ſit up and walke about, for indeed when they be ſuffered ſo to couch, immediately comes their Familiars into the room and ſcareth the watchers, and heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth on the Witch, though contrary to the true meaning of the ſame inſtructions, diverſe have been by ruſticall People, (they hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them confeſs to be Witches) miſ-uſed, ſpoiled, and abuſed, diverſe whereof have ſuffered for the ſame, but could never be proved againſt this Diſcoverer to have a hand in it, or conſent to it; and hath likewiſe been un-uſed by him and others, ever ſince the time they were kept from ſleepe.</p>
            <p>Quer. 10. <hi>But there hath been an abominable, inhumane, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifull
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:160234:5"/>
tryall of thoſe poore creatures, by tying them, and heaving them into the water; a tryall not allowable by Law or conſcience, and I would faint know the reaſons for that.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is not denyed but many were ſo ſerved as had Papps, and floated, others that had none were tryed with them and ſunk, but marke the reaſons.</p>
            <p>For firſt the Divels policie is great, in perſwading many to come of their owne accord to be tryed, perswading them their marks are ſo cloſe they ſhall not be found out, ſo as diverſe have come 10. or 12. Miles to be ſearched of their own accord, and hanged for their labour, (as one <hi>Meggs</hi> a Baker did, who lived within 7. Miles of <hi>Norwich,</hi> and was hanged at <hi>Norwich</hi> Aſſizes for witchcraft) then when they find that the Devil tells them falſe they reflect on him, and he (as 40. have confeſsed) adviſeth them to be ſworne, and tels them they ſhall ſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nke and be cleared that way, then when they be tryed that way and floate, they ſee the Devill deceives them againe, and have ſo laid open his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It was never brought in againſt any of them at their tryals as any evidence.</p>
            <p n="3">3. King <hi>James</hi> in his <hi>Demonology</hi> ſaith, it is a certaine rule, for (ſaith he) Witches deny their baptiſme when they Covenant with the Devill, water being the ſole element thereof, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith he, when they be heaved into the water, the water refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to receive them into her boſome, (they being ſuch Miſcreants to deny their baptiſme) and ſuffers them to float, as the Froath on the Sea, which the water will not receive, but caſts it up and downe, till it comes to the earthy element the ſhore, and there leaves it to conſume.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Obſerve theſe generation of Witches, if they be at any time abuſed by being called Whore, Theefe, &amp;c, by any where they live, they are the readieſt to cry and wring their hands, and ſhed tears in abundance &amp; run with full and right ſorrowfull acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to ſome Juſtice of the Peace, and with many teares make their complaints: but now behold their ſtupidity; nature or the elements reflection from them, when they are accuſed for this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible and damnable ſin of Witchcraft, they never alter or change
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:160234:5"/>
their countenances, nor let one Teare fall. This by the way, ſwimming (by able Divines whom I reverence) is condemned for no way, and therefore of late hath, and for ever ſhall be left.</p>
            <p>Quer. 11. <hi>Oh! but if this torturing Witch-catcher can by all or any of theſe meanes wring out a word or two of confeſsion from any of theſe ſtupified, ignorant, unitelligible, poore ſilly creatures, (though none heare it but himſelfe) he will adde and put her in feare to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe telling her, elſe ſhe ſhall be hanged; but if ſhe doe, he will ſet her at liberty, and ſo put a word into her mouth, and make ſuch a ſilly creature confeſſe ſhe knowes not what.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> He is of a better conſcience, and for your better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of him, he doth thus uncaſe himſelfe to all, and declares what confeſſions (though made by a Witch againſt her ſelfe) he allowes not of, and doth altogether account of no validity, or worthy of credence to be given to it, and ever did ſo account it, and ever likewiſe ſhall.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He utterly denyes that confeſſion of a Witch to be of any validity, when it is drawn from her by any torture or violence whatſoever; although after watching, walking, or ſwimming, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe have ſuffered, yet peradventure Magiſtrates with much care and diligence did ſolely and fully examine them after ſleepe, and conſideration ſufficient.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He utterly denyes that confeſſion of a Witch, which is drawn from her by flattery, viz. <hi>if you will confeſſe you ſhall go home, you ſhall not go to the Goals, nor be hanged, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. He utterly denyes that confeſſion of a With, when ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſseth any improbability, impoſſibility, as <hi>flying in the ayre, riding on a broom, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. He utterly denyes a confeſſion of a Witch, when it is inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated to her, and words put into her mouth, to be of any force or effect: as to ſay to a ſilly (yet Witch wicked enough) <hi>you have foure Imps have you not?</hi> She anſwers affirmatively, Yes: <hi>did they not ſuck you?</hi> Yes, ſaith ſhe: <hi>Are not their names ſo, and ſo?</hi> Yes, ſaith ſhee: <hi>Did not you ſend ſuch an Impe to kill my child?</hi> Yes ſaith ſhe this being all her confeſſion after this manner, it is by him accompted nothing, and he earneſtly doth deſire that all Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates and Jurors would a little more then ever they did, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:160234:6"/>
witneſses, about the interrogated confeſſions.</p>
            <p>Quer. 12. <hi>If all theſe confeſſions be denyed, I wonder what he will make a confeſſion, for ſure it is, all theſe wayes have been uſed and took for good confeſsions, and many have ſuffered for them, and I know not what, he will then make a confeſsion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes, in brief he will declare what confeſſion of a Witch is of validity and force in his judgement, to hang a Witch: when a Witch is firſt found with teats, then ſequeſtred from her houſe, which is onely to keep her old aſsociates from her, and ſo by good counſell brought into a ſad condition, by underſtanding of the horribleneſs of her ſin, and the judgements threatned againſt her; and knowing the Devils malice and ſubtile circumventions, is brought to remorſe and ſorrow for complying with Satan ſo long, and diſobeying Gods ſacred Commands, doth then deſire to unfold her mind with much bitterneſs, and then without any of the before-mentioned hard uſages or queſtions put to her, doth of her owne accord declare what was the occaſion of the Devils ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing to her, whether ignorance, pride, anger, malice, &amp;c. was predominant over her, ſhe doth then declare what ſpeech they had, what likeneſs he was in, what voice he had, what familiars he ſent her, what number of ſpirits, what names they had, what ſhape they were in, what imployment ſhe ſet them about to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall perſons in ſeverall places, (unknowne to the hearers) all which miſchiefes being proved to be done, at the ſame time ſhe confeſsed to the ſame parties for the ſame cauſe, and all effected, is teſtimony enough againſt her for all her denyall.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 13. <hi>How can any poſsibly beleeve that the Devill and the Witch joyning together, ſhould have ſuch power, as the Witches con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, to kill ſuch and ſuch a man, child, horſe, cow, or the like; if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve they can doe what they will, then we derogate from Gods power, who for certaine limits the Devill and the Witch; and I cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve they have any power at all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> God ſuffers the Devill many times to doe much hurt, and the devill doth play many times the deluder and impoſtor with theſe Witches, in perſwading them that they are the cauſe of ſuch and ſuch a murder wrought by him with their conſents, when and indeed neither he nor they had any hand in it, as thus:
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:160234:6"/>
We muſt needs argue, he is of a long ſtanding, above 6000. yeers, then he muſt needs be the beſt Scholar in all knowledges of arts and tongues, &amp; ſo have the beſt skill in <hi>Phyſicke,</hi> judgment in <hi>Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ognomie,</hi> and knowledge of what diſeaſe is reigning or predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in this or that mans body, (and ſo for cattell too) by reaſon of his long experience. This ſubtile tempter knowing ſuch a man lyable to ſome ſudden diſeaſe, (as by experience I have found) as <hi>Pluriſie, Impoſthume,</hi> &amp;c. he reſorts to divers Witches; if they know the man, and ſeek to make a difference between the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and the party, it may be by telling them he hath threatned to have them very ſhortly ſearched, and ſo hanged for Witches, then they all conſult with <hi>Satan</hi> to ſave themſelves, and <hi>Satan</hi> ſtands ready prepared, with a <hi>What will you have me doe for you,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Divells ſpeech to the Witches.</note> 
               <hi>my deare and neareſt children, covenanted and compacted with me in my helliſh league, and ſealed with your blood, my delicate firebrand-darlings.</hi> Oh thou (ſay they) that at the firſt didſt promiſe to ſave us thy ſervants from any of our deadly enemies diſcovery, and didſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to avenge and ſlay all thoſe, we pleaſed, that did offend us; Murther that wretch ſuddenly who threatens the down-fall of your loyall ſubjects. He then promiſeth to effect it. Next newes is heard the partie is dead, he comes to the witch, and gets a world of reverence, credence and reſpect for his power and activeneſs, when and indeed the diſeaſe kills the party, not the Witch, nor the Devill, (onely the Devill knew that ſuch a diſeaſe was predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant) and the witch aggravates her damnation by her familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and conſent to the Devill, and ſo comes likewiſe in compaſs of the Lawes. This is Satans uſuall impoſtring and deluding, but not his conſtant courſe of proceeding, for he and the witch doe miſchiefe too much. But I would that Magiſtrates and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rats would a little examine witneſses when they heare witches confeſs ſuch and ſuch a murder, whether the party had not long time before, or at the time when the witch grew ſuſpected, ſome diſeaſe or other predominant, which might cauſe that iſsue or effect of death.</p>
            <p>Quer. 14. <hi>All that the witch-finder doth, is to fleece the country of their money, and therefore rides and goes to townes to have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, and promiſeth them faire promiſes, and it may be doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:160234:7"/>
for it, and poſſeſſeth many men that they have ſo many wizzards and ſo many witches in their towne, and ſo hartens them on to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> You doe him a great deale of wrong in every of theſe particulars. For, firſt,</p>
            <p n="1">1. He never went to any towne or place, but they rode, writ, or ſent often for him, and were (for ought he knew) glad of him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He is a man that doth diſclaime that ever he detected a witch, or ſaid, Thou art a witch; only after her tryall by ſearch, and their owne confeſſions, he as others may judge.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Laſtly, judge how he fleeceth the Country, and inriches himſelfe, by conſidering the vaſt ſumme he takes of every towne, he demands but 20.ſ. a town, &amp; doth ſometimes ride 20. miles for that, &amp; hath no more for all his charges thither and back again (&amp; it may be ſtayes a weeke there) and finde there 3. or 4. witches, or if it be but one, cheap enough, and this is the great ſumme he takes to maintaine his Companie with 3. horſes.</p>
