            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

made falſe Tranſcripts. They <hi>Exciz'd</hi> what they liked not; ſo
mangled and <hi>Reform'd,</hi> that 'twas no Character of an <hi>Aſſembler,</hi>

<hi>Judas</hi> Root and Branch. This <hi>Aſſembly</hi> at firſt
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98178:3"/>
was a full Century; which ſhould be reckon'd as
the Scholiaſt's <hi>Hecatomb,</hi> by their Feet, not Heads:
or count them by Scores, for in things without
Heads Six-core to go to an Hundred. They would
be a New <hi>Septuagint;</hi> the Old tranſlated Scripture
out of <hi>Hebrew</hi> into <hi>Greek,</hi> theſe turn it to <hi>four ſhillings
a day.</hi> And all theſe <hi>Aſſemblers</hi> were begot in one day,
as <hi>Hercules's</hi> fifty Baſtards all in one night. Their
firſt Liſt was ſprinkled with ſome names of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
(Dr. <hi>Sanderſon,</hi> Dr. <hi>Morley,</hi> Dr. <hi>Hammond, &amp;c.</hi>)
But theſe were <hi>Divines;</hi> too worthy to mix with
ſuch <hi>ſcandalous Miniſters,</hi> and would not <hi>Aſſemble</hi>
without the <hi>Royal Call.</hi> Nay, the firſt Liſt had
one Archbiſhop, one Biſhop, and an Half, (for
Biſhop <hi>Brownrigg</hi> was then but <hi>Elect.</hi>) But now
their <hi>Aſſembly</hi> (as Philoſophers think the World)
conſiſts of <hi>Atoms;</hi> petty ſmall Levites, whoſe
<hi>Parts</hi> are not <hi>perceptible.</hi> And yet theſe inferior
poſtern Teachers have intoxicated <hi>England,</hi> (for a

they all meet, they ſhew Beaſts in <hi>Africk</hi> by
promiſcuous coupling ingender Monſters. Mr. <hi>Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</hi>
viſit's them (as <hi>Perſians</hi> uſe) to ſee <hi>wild Aſſes</hi>
fight: when the <hi>Commons</hi> have tyr'd him with
their new Law, theſe Brethren refreſh him with
their mad Goſpel: They lately were gravell'd
'twixt <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and <hi>Jericho;</hi> they knew not the

PROVINCIALL, CLASSICALL, CONGREGATIO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NALL;
he ſwore <hi>damnably,</hi> that a pack of good Dogs
made better Muſick: His Alluſion was proper
ſince the <hi>Elder's Maid</hi> had a four-legg'd Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.
To ſpeak truth, this <hi>Aſſembly</hi> is the <hi>two
Houſes</hi> Tiring-room, where the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi>
put on their Viſards and Maſques of Religion.
And their <hi>Honors</hi> have ſo <hi>ſifted</hi> the Church, that
at laſt they have found the <hi>Bran</hi> of the Clergy.
Yet ſuch poor Church-menders muſt Reform and
ſhuffle, though they find Church-Government
may a thouſand wayes be chang'd for the worſe,
but not one way for the better. They have lately
publiſh'd ANNOTATIONS on the Bible,
where their firſt Note (on the word <hi>CREATE</hi>)
is a Libel againſt Kings for creating of Honors.
Their <hi>Annotation</hi> on <hi>Jacob's</hi> two Kids, is, that <hi>two
Kids are too much for one mans ſupper:</hi> but <hi>he had</hi> (ſay
they) <hi>but one Kid, and the other made Sauce.</hi> They
obſerve upon <hi>Herod,</hi> what a Tyrant he was, to kill
Infants under two years old, <hi>without giving them a

legal Tryal</hi> that they might ſpeak for themſelves.
Commonly they follow the <hi>Geneva</hi> Margin, as
thoſe Sea-men who underſtood not the <hi>Compaſs</hi>
crept along the Shore. But I hear they threaten a
<hi>ſecond Edition,</hi> and in the interim thruſt forth a
paultry <hi>Catechiſm,</hi> which expounds Nine <hi>Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
and eleven Articles of the <hi>Creed.</hi> Of late
they are much in love with <hi>Chronograms,</hi> becauſe
(if poſsible) they are duller than <hi>Anagrams;</hi> O
how they have torn the poor Biſhops names to
pick out the number 666! little dreaming that a
whole Bakers dozen of their own <hi>Aſſembly</hi> have
that Beaſtly Number in each of their Names,
and that as exactly as their <hi>Solemn League and
Covenant</hi> conſiſt's of 666 words. But though the
<hi>Aſſembler's</hi> Brains are Lead, his Countenance is
Braſs; for he damn'd ſuch as held two Benefices,
while himſelf has four or five, beſides his Concubin.
<hi>Lecture.</hi> He is not againſt <hi>Pluralities,</hi> but <hi>Duali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;</hi>

or ſteals in through Vaults and Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
by clandeſtine Contracts with an Expecting
Patron. He is moſt ſure no Law can hurt him, for
Lawes dyed in <hi>England</hi> the year before the <hi>Aſſembler</hi>
was born. The beſt way to hold him, is (as our
King <hi>Richard</hi> bound ths King of <hi>Cyprus</hi>) in <hi>ſilver
chains.</hi> He love's to diſcourſe of the <hi>new Jeruſalem,</hi>
becauſe her ſtreets are of <hi>fine gold;</hi> and yet could
like <hi>London</hi> as well; were <hi>Cheapſide</hi> pav'd with the
<hi>Philoſophers ſtone.</hi> Nay, he would ſay his Prayers with
Beads, if he might have a Set made all of Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds:
This, this is it which tempts him to
ſuch mad Articles againſt the <hi>Loyal Clergie,</hi> whom
he dreſſe's as he would have them appear; juſt as
the Ballad of <hi>Dr. Fauſtus</hi> brings forth the Devil in a
<hi>Friars weed.</hi> He accus'd one Miniſter, for ſaying
<hi>the Bleſſed Virgin was the Mother of God,</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as
the Ancients call her.) Another he charg'd for a
common Drunkard, whom all the Countrey
knows has drunk nothing but Water theſe ſix and
twenty years. But the <hi>Aſſembler</hi> himſelf can drink
Widows Tears though their Husbands are not
dead. Sure, if <hi>Paracelſus's</hi> Doctrine were true, (that
<hi>to eat creatures alive will perpetuate mans life</hi>) the <hi>Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler</hi>
were immortal, for he ſwallows quick Men,
Wives, and Children; and devours <hi>Lives</hi> as well as
<hi>Livings;</hi> as if he were born in that Pagan Province
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98178:5"/>
where <hi>None might marry till he had kill'd twelve
Chriſtians.</hi> This makes him kneel to Lieutenant
General <hi>Cromwell</hi> (as <hi>Indians</hi> to the <hi>Devil;</hi>) for he
ſaw how <hi>Oliver</hi> firſt threw—, then—, and
can with a wink do as much for—: like <hi>Milo</hi> in
the <hi>Olympicks,</hi> by practiſing on a <hi>Calf</hi> grew ſtrong

Thanks for Licencing his <hi>Alcoran</hi> to be <hi>printed in
Engliſh;</hi> but hearing <hi>Ottoman Cromwell</hi> had talk'd of
<hi>marching to the walls of Conſtantinople,</hi> that Embaſſy
was ſtopt. The onely difference 'twixt the <hi>Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler</hi>
and a <hi>Turk,</hi> is, that one plant's Religion by the
<hi>power of the Sword,</hi> and the other by the power of the
<hi>Cymetar.</hi> Nay, the greateſt ſtrife in their whole
Conventicle, is who ſhall do worſt; for they all
intend to make the Church but a <hi>Sepulchre,</hi> having
not onely <hi>plunder'd,</hi> but <hi>anatomiz'd</hi> all the true
Clergy; whoſe Torment is heightned in being
deſtroy'd by ſuch <hi>dull</hi> Inſtruments; as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Iſaiah</hi> was ſawn to pieces with a <hi>wooden Saw.</hi>
The <hi>Aſſembler</hi> wonder's that the King and his
Friends live ſtill in <hi>Hope;</hi> he thinks them all in
St. <hi>Clemens</hi> caſe, drown'd with an Anchor tyed
about his neck. He has now got power to <hi>Viſit</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:98178:5"/>
the <hi>Univerſities;</hi> where theſe blinking <hi>Viſitors</hi> look
on eminent Scholars (as the Blind-man who
ſaw <hi>Men</hi> like <hi>Trees</hi>) as Timber growing within the
Root-and-Branch <hi>Ordinance.</hi> The <hi>Aſſembler</hi> has
now left Scholars ſo poor, they have ſcarce Raggs
wherewith to make Paper. A man would think
the <hi>Two Houſes</hi> intend to <hi>tranſport</hi> the <hi>Univerſities,</hi>
ſince they load Aſſes with Colledge-revenues. For
though theſe <hi>Aſſemblers</hi> made themſelves <hi>Heads,</hi>
they are rather the <hi>Hands</hi> of Colledges, for they all
are Takers, and take all. And yet they are ſuch
creeping Tyrants, that Scholars are expell'd
the two <hi>Univerſities,</hi> as the old <hi>Thracians,</hi> forc'd from
their Countrey by Ratts and Mice. So that Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
now is ſo much advanc'd, as <hi>Arrowſmith's</hi> Glaſseye
ſees more than his Natural. They never ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
a good Scholar to a <hi>Benefice,</hi> for the <hi>Aſſembly</hi>'s
Balance is the <hi>Lake</hi> of <hi>Sodom,</hi> where Iron ſwims
and Feathers ſink. Their Divinity-Diſputations
are with Women or Lay-men; and 'tis onely on
one Queſtion (<hi>Epiſcopacy</hi>) where the <hi>Aſſembler</hi> talks
all that he and his friends can ſay, (though his beſt
<hi>medium</hi> to prove <hi>Presbyters</hi> more ancient than <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,</hi>
is, that <hi>Scribes, Phariſees, Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Elders</hi>
were before the <hi>Apoſtles;</hi>) Yet if a Scholar or good
Argument come, he flie's them as much as if they
were his Text. This made him curſe Dr. <hi>Steward,</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:98178:6"/>
Dr. <hi>Laney,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Hammond;</hi> and had he not had
more Braſs in his Face then in his Kitchin, he had
hang'd himſelf at <hi>Uxbridge,</hi> and ended with that
<hi>Treaty.</hi> For he has naught of <hi>Logick,</hi> but her <hi>clutch'd
fiſt,</hi> and rail's at <hi>Philoſophy</hi> as Beggars do at Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
He has very bad luck when he deals in <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lologie,</hi>
as one of them (and that no mean man)
who, in his Preface to the <hi>Reader,</hi> ſayes, that <hi>St.
Paul had read Euſtathius upon Homer,</hi> though the
<hi>Apoſtle</hi> dyed a thouſand years before <hi>Euſtathius</hi> was
born. The <hi>Aſſembler's</hi> Dyet is ſtrangely different,
for he dines wretchedly on dry Bread at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi>
four <hi>Aſſemblers</hi> for thirteen pence: But this ſharpens
and whets him for Supper, where he feeds <hi>gratis</hi>
with his City-Landlord, to whom he brings a huge
Stomach and News; for which cramm'd Capons
cram him. He ſcrew's into Families where there is
ſome rich Daughter or Heir; but whoever takes
him into their boſom, will dye like <hi>Cleopatra.</hi> When
it rain's he is Coach'd (a <hi>Claſsis</hi> of them together)
rowling his Eyes to mark who beholds him. His
ſhorteſt things are his Hair and his Cloak. His
Hair is cut to the figure of 3; two high Cliffs run
up his Temples, whoſe Cape of ſhorn hair ſhoot's
down his Forehead, with Creeks indented, where
his Ears ride at Anchor. Had this falſe Prophet
been carried with <hi>Habbakuk,</hi> the <hi>Angel</hi> had caught
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:98178:6"/>
faſt hold of his <hi>Ears,</hi> and led him as he leads his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditory.
His Eyes are part of his Tithe at <hi>Eaſter,</hi>
which he boyles at each Sermon. He has two
Mouthes, his Noſe is one, for he ſpeaks through
both. His Hands are not in his Gloves, but
his Gloves in his Hands, for 'twixt Sweatings,
that is, Sermons, he handles little elſe, except
his dear Mammon. His Gown (I mean his Cloak)
reache's but his pockets: when he rides in that Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
with a Hood on his ſhoulders and a Hat above
both, is he not then his own <hi>Man of ſin</hi> with the
<hi>Triple Crown?</hi> you would ſwear ſome honeſt Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter
dreſs'd him, and made him the Tunnell of a
Country Chimney. His Doubles and Hoſe are of
dark Blew, a grain deeper than pure <hi>Coventry:</hi> but
of late he's in Black, ſince the Loyal Clergy were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted
into Colours His two longeſt things are his
<hi>Nayles</hi> and his <hi>Prayer.</hi> But the cleaneſt thing about
him is his Pulpit-Cuſhion, for he ſtill beats the Duſt
out of it. To do him right, commonly he weares a
pair of good Lungs, whereby he turns the Church
into a Belfry, for his Clapper make's ſuch a Din, you
cannot hear the <hi>Cymball</hi> for the <hi>Tinkling.</hi> If his Pulpit
be large, he walk's his Round, and ſpeaks as from a
Garriſon, (his own Neck is Palizado'd with Ruff)
When he firſt enters his Prayer before Sermon, he
wink's and gaſp's, and gaſp's and wink's, as if he
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98178:7"/>
prepar'd to preach in another world: He ſeems in a
Slumber, then in a Dream; then rumbles awhile;
at laſt he ſound's forth, and then throw's ſo much
Dirt and Non-ſenſe towards Heaven, as he durſt not
offer to a Member of Parliament. Now becauſe Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
bids him <hi>not curſe the King in his Thought,</hi> he
do's it in his Pulpit by word of mouth; though
Heaven ſtrike him dumb in the very Act, as it did
<hi>Hill</hi> at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> who while he pray'd, <hi>Depoſe Him, O
Lord, who would depoſe us,</hi> was made the <hi>dumb Devil.</hi>
This (one would think) ſhould <hi>gargle</hi> his foul
mouth. For his only hope why God ſhould hear
him againſt the <hi>King,</hi> is the Devil himſelf (that great
<hi>Aſſembler</hi>) was heard againſt <hi>Job.</hi> His whole Prayer is
ſuch an irrational Bleating that (without a Metaphor)
'tis the <hi>Calves of his Lipps:</hi> And commonly 'tis larded
with fine new words, as <hi>Savingable, Muchly, Chriſt-Jeſuſneſs,</hi>
&amp;c. and yet he has the face to preach againſt
<hi>Prayer in an unknown Tongue.</hi> Sometimes he's foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd,
and then there is ſuch hideous Coughing! But
that's very ſeldom, for he can glibly run over Non-ſenſe,
as an empty Cart trundles down a Hill. When
the <hi>King</hi> girt round the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> at <hi>Leſtythiell,</hi> an
<hi>Aſſembler</hi> complain'd that <hi>God had drawn his People into the
Wilderneſſe,</hi> and told Him, <hi>He was bound in honour to feed
them; for, Lord,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>ſince thou giv'ſt them no Meat,
we pray thee, O Lord, to give them no Stomachs.</hi> He tore
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:98178:7"/>
the <hi>Liturgie,</hi> becauſe, forſooth, it ſhackled his Spirit,
(he would be a <hi>Devil</hi> without a <hi>circle;</hi>) and now if he
ſee the Book of <hi>Common Prayer,</hi> the Fire ſees it next, as
ſure as the Biſhops were burn'd who compil'd it.
Yet he has mercy on <hi>Hopkins</hi> and <hi>Sternhold,</hi> becauſe
their <hi>Meeters</hi> are ſung without Authority (no Statute,
Canon, or Injunction at all;) only, like himſelf,
firſt crept into private Houſes, and then into Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.
Mr. <hi>Rous</hi> mov'd thoſe <hi>Meetres</hi> might be Seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred,
and his own new Rithmes to enjoy the Seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration;
but was Refus'd, becauſe <hi>John Hopkins</hi> was
as ancient as <hi>John Calvin;</hi> Beſides, when <hi>Rous</hi> ſtood
forth for his Trial, <hi>Robin Wiſdom</hi> was found the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Poet. Tis true they have a <hi>Directory,</hi> but 'tis good
for nothing but <hi>Adoniram,</hi> who ſold the Original for
400 l. And the Book muſt ſerve both <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>Scotland,</hi> as the <hi>Directory Needle</hi> point's North and
South. The <hi>Aſſembler's</hi> only Ingenuity is, that he
pray's for an <hi>ex tempore</hi> Spirit, ſince his Conſcience
tell's him he has no Learning. His Prayer thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
he then look'd round, to obſerve the Sex of his
Congregation, and accordingly turn's the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle's
<hi>Men, Fathers, and Brethren</hi> into <hi>Dear Brethren and
Siſters.</hi> For, his uſual Auditory is moſt part <hi>Female;</hi>
and as many Siſters flock to Him, as at <hi>Paris</hi> on Saint
<hi>Margaret's</hi> day, when all come to Church that are or
hope to be with child that year. He divides his Text
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:98178:8"/>
as he did the Kingdom, make's one part fight againſt
another: or as <hi>Burges</hi> divides the Dean of <hi>Paul's</hi>
Houſe, not into <hi>Parts,</hi> but <hi>Tenements,</hi> that is, ſo as
'twill yield moſt money. And properly they are <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nements;</hi>
for each Part muſt be <hi>dwelt</hi> upon, though
himſelf comes near it but once a <hi>Quarter;</hi> and ſo his
Text is rather <hi>Let out</hi> than <hi>Divided.</hi> Yet ſometimes
(to ſhew his skill in <hi>Keckerman,</hi>) he <hi>Butcher</hi>'s a Text,
cut's it (juſt as the <hi>Levite</hi> did his <hi>Concubine</hi>) into many
dead Parts, breaking the Senſe and Words all to
pieces, and then they are not Divided, but <hi>ſhatter'd,</hi>
like the Splinters of <hi>Don Quixot's</hi> Lance. If his Text
be to the Occaſion, his firſt Diſh is <hi>Apples of Gold in
Pictures of Silver;</hi> yet tells not the People what <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures</hi>
thoſe were. His Sermon and Prayer grin at each
other, the one is <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> the other <hi>Independent,</hi> for
he preaches up the <hi>Claſſes,</hi> yet pray's for the <hi>Army.</hi>
Let his <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Reaſon</hi> be what they will, his <hi>Uſe</hi>
is ſtill to ſave his <hi>Benefice</hi> and augment his <hi>Lecture.</hi>
He talks much of <hi>Truth,</hi> but abhors <hi>Peace,</hi> leſt it ſtrip
him as <hi>naked</hi> as <hi>Truth;</hi> and therefore hates a <hi>Perſonal
Treaty,</hi> unleſſe with a Siſter. He has a rare ſimpring
way of expreſſion; he call's a Marryed Couple <hi>Saints
that enjoy the Myſtery;</hi> and a man Drunk, is <hi>a Brother
full of the Creature.</hi> Yet at Wedding Sermons he is very
familiar, and (like that Picture in the Church at <hi>Ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>)
ſhew's <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> without <hi>Fig-leaves.</hi> At Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:98178:8"/>
he gives infallible Signs that the Party is gone
to Heaven; but his chief Mark of a <hi>child of God,</hi> is <hi>to be
good to God's Miniſters.</hi> And hence 'tis he call's his Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<hi>Manna,</hi> fitted not to his Hearers <hi>Neceſsity,</hi> but their
<hi>Palat,</hi> for 'tis to feed Himſelf, not them. If he chance
to tire, he refreſhes himſelf with the People's Hum,
as a Collar of Bells do chear up a Pack-horſe. 'Tis
no wonder hee'l preach, but that any will hear him;
(and his conſtant Auditors do but ſhew the length
of their Ears;) For he is ſuch an <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
that to hear him make's good Scholars ſick, but to
read him is death. Yet though you heard him three
hours hee'l ask a fourth, as the Beggar at <hi>Delph</hi> craves
your Charity <hi>becauſe he eats four pound of Bread at a Meal.</hi>
'Twas from his Larum the <hi>Watch-makers</hi> learn'd their
<hi>infinit Skrew.</hi> His Glaſſe and Text are equally hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
that is, once an hour: nay ſometimes he ſally's
and never returns, and then we ſhould leave him to
the Company of <hi>Lorimers,</hi> for he muſt be held with
Bit and Bridle. Who ever once has been at his
Church can never doubt the Hiſtory of <hi>Balaam.</hi> If he
have got any new Tale or Expreſſion, 'tis eaſier to
make Stones ſpeak than him to hold his peace. He
hates a Church where there is an <hi>Eccho,</hi> for it robs him
of his dear <hi>Repetition,</hi> and confounds the Auditory as
well as he. But of all Mortals I admire the <hi>Short-hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
who have the patience to write from his Mouth:
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:98178:9"/>
had they the art to ſhorten it into Senſe, they might
write his whole Sermon on the back of their Nail.
For his Invention conſiſt's in finding a way to ſpeak
Nothing upon any thing; and were he in the <hi>Grand
Seigniors</hi> power, he would lodge him with his <hi>Mutes;</hi>
for <hi>Nothing</hi> and <hi>Nothing to purpoſe</hi> are all one. I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in conſcience he can preach againſt <hi>Sleeping</hi> at his
<hi>Opium</hi>-Sermons. He preaches indeed both in ſeaſon
and out of ſeaſon; for he rayl's at Popery, when the
Land is almoſt loſt in Presbytery, and would cry out
<hi>Fire, Fire,</hi> in <hi>Noah's Flood.</hi> Yet all this he ſo act's with
his Hands, that in this ſenſe too his Preaching is a
<hi>Handicraft.</hi> Nor can we complain that <hi>Playes</hi> are
put down while he can preach, ſave only his <hi>Sermons</hi>
have worſe Senſe, and leſſe Truth. But he blew down
the <hi>Stage</hi> and preach'd up the <hi>Scaffold.</hi> And very wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
leſt men ſhould track him, and find where he
pilſers all his beſt <hi>Simile's,</hi> (the only thing wherein he's
commendable, St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf having cull'd Sentences
from <hi>Menander's THAIS,</hi> though 'twas his worſt,
that is, unchaſt Comedy.) Sometimes the <hi>Aſſembler</hi>
will venture at the Original, and then (with the
Tranſlator of <hi>Don Quixot</hi>) he miſtake's <hi>Sobs and Sighs</hi>
for <hi>Eggs and Collops.</hi> But commonly (for want of
<hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi>) he learns <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and ſtreight is <hi>illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated;</hi>
that is, mad; his Brain is broke by a
Brickbat caſt from the Tower of <hi>Babel.</hi> And yet this
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:98178:9"/>
empty windy Teacher has <hi>Lectur'd</hi> a War quite round
the Kingdom: he has found a <hi>Circulation of Bloud</hi> for
<hi>Deſtruction</hi> (as famous <hi>Harvey</hi> for <hi>Preſervation</hi>) of
Mankind. 'Twas eaſie to foreſee a great Mortality
when Ravens were heard in all <hi>Corporations.</hi> For,
as Multitude of Froggs preſage a Peſtilence, ſo croak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Lecturers</hi> foretold an <hi>Aſſembly.</hi> Men come to
Church, as the Great <hi>Alexander</hi> went to Sacrifice, led by
Crows. You have ſeen a ſmall <hi>Elder-tree</hi> grow in
Chinks and Clefts of Church-walls; it ſeems rather
a <hi>Weed</hi> than a <hi>Tree;</hi> which, lend it growth, make's
a Rent in the Wall, and throw's downe the
Church. Is not this the <hi>Aſſembler?</hi> grown from
Schiſmes (which himſelf begot,) and if permitted,
will make the Church but a <hi>Floor</hi> or <hi>Church-yard.</hi> Yet,
for all this, he will be call'd <hi>Chriſt's Munſter</hi> and <hi>Saint,</hi>
as the Rebels againſt King <hi>John</hi> were <hi>the Army of God.</hi>
Sure when they meet, they cannot but ſmile; for
the dulleſt among them needs muſt know that they
all cheat the people: ſuch groſſe low Impoſtors, that
we die the death of the Emperor <hi>Claudius,</hi> poyſon'd
by <hi>Muſhromes.</hi> The old Hereticks had Skill and Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
(ſome excuſe for a Seduced Church,) Thoſe were
<hi>Scholars,</hi> but theſe are <hi>Aſſemblers;</hi> whoſe very Brains (as
<hi>Manichaeu's</hi> skin) are ſtuff'd with <hi>Chaff.</hi> For they
ſtudy little, and preach much, ever ſick of a <hi>Diabete:</hi>
nor do they <hi>read,</hi> but <hi>weed</hi> Authours, picking up
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:98178:10"/>
cheap and refuſe Notes, that with <hi>Caligula</hi> they ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Cockle-ſhells, and with <hi>Domitian</hi> retire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their Studie to catch Flies. At <hi>Faſts</hi> and
<hi>Thankſgivings</hi> the <hi>Aſſembler</hi> is the <hi>States'</hi> Trumpet;
for then he doth not <hi>preach,</hi> but is <hi>blown;</hi> proclaims
News, very loud, the Trumpet and his Forehead
being both of one metal. (And yet, good Man,
he ſtill prayes for <hi>Boldneſs.</hi>) He hackney's out his
Voice like a Crier; and is a kind of <hi>Spiritual Agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant,</hi>
receives Orders, and ſpreads them. In earneſt
the <hi>States</hi> can't want this Tool, for without him the
<hi>Saints</hi> would ſcarce <hi>Aſſemble.</hi> And if the Zealots
chance to fly out, they are charm'd home by this
<hi>Sounding Braſs.</hi> There is not on earth a baſer Syco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant;
for he ever is chewing ſome <hi>Vote</hi> or <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance;</hi>
and tells the People how <hi>ſavoury</hi> it is; like
him who lick'd up the Emperour's ſpittle and ſwore
'twas ſweet. Would the <hi>two Houſes</hi> give him <hi>Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral
Lands,</hi> he would prove <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> to be
<hi>Jure Divino:</hi> but ſhould they offer him the <hi>Self-denying
Ordinance,</hi> he would juſtifie the Devil and
curſe them to their faces, (his Brother Kirk-man
did it in <hi>Scotland.</hi>)' Tis pleaſant to obſerve how
finely they play into each others hands; <hi>Marſhall</hi>
procures Thanks to be given to <hi>Sedgwick</hi> (for his
great pains) <hi>Sedgwick</hi> obtains as much for <hi>Marſhall,</hi>
and ſo they all pimp for one another. But yet (to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:98178:10"/>
their great comfort be it ſpoken) their whole ſeven-years
Sermons at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> are now to be ſold in
<hi>Fetter-lane</hi> and <hi>Pye-corner.</hi> Before a Battail the <hi>Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler</hi>
ever ſpeaks to the Souldiers; and the holding
up of his hands muſt be as neceſſary as <hi>Moſes</hi>'s
againſt the <hi>Amalekites:</hi> For he prick's them on, tells
them that <hi>God loves none but the valiant:</hi> but when
Bullets flye, Himſelf runns firſt, and then cry's <hi>All
the ſonns of</hi> Adam <hi>are cowards!</hi> Were there any <hi>Metem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pſychoſis</hi>
his Soul would want a Lodging; no ſingle
Beaſt could fit him, being wiſe as a Sheep and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
as a Wolf. His ſole comfort is, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
out-ſin <hi>Hugh Peters:</hi> Sure, as Satan
hath poſſeſſed the <hi>Aſſembler,</hi> ſo <hi>Hugh Peters</hi> hath
poſſeſſed Satan, and is the Devil's Devil. He alone
would fill a whole Herd of <hi>Gadarens.</hi> He hath
ſuck'd Bloud ever ſince he lay in the <hi>Butcher's</hi>
Sheets; and now (like his <hi>Sultan</hi>) has a Shambles
in his Countenance; ſo crimſon and torrid, you
may there read how St. <hi>Lawrence</hi> dyed, and think
<hi>the three children</hi> were delivered from his face. This
is St. <hi>Hugh,</hi> who will <hi>Levell</hi> the <hi>Aſſembler,</hi> or <hi>the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil's
an Aſſe.</hi> Yoke theſe Brethren; and they two
couple like a <hi>Sadducee</hi> and a <hi>Phariſee,</hi> or a <hi>Turk</hi>
and a <hi>Perſian,</hi> both Mahumetans. But the <hi>Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler's</hi>
deepeſt higheſt Abomination, is his <hi>Solemn
League and Covenant;</hi> whereby he ſtrive's to <hi>damn</hi> or
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98178:11"/>
               <hi>begger</hi> the whole Kingdom; out-doing the Devil,
who onely <hi>perſwades,</hi> but the <hi>Aſſembler force's</hi> to <hi>perjury</hi>
or <hi>ſtarving.</hi> And this (whoever live's to obſerve it)
will one day ſink both him and his Faction: for he
and his <hi>Oath</hi> are ſo much one, that were he half-hang'd
and let down again, his firſt word would
be <hi>Covenant! Covenant!</hi>
            </p>
