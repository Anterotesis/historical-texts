            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

When the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Synagogue having moſt abominably apoſtatiz'd both in Doctrine, Worſhip, Diſcipline, and Governement; <hi>Luther</hi> and other faithfull Servants of Chriſt did earneſtly bend themſelves to endeavour a reformation in Religion, the Antichriſtian world was mad with fury. To come yet a little nearer home. When Religion was reformed in <hi>Scotland</hi> in Doctrine and Worſhip, the Church of Chriſt there had many conflicts, and the worke was long obſtructed, before the Governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Diſcipline of Chriſt could be fully eſtabliſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them; as it is in freſh remembrance, what troubles they paſſed through more lately, in their contending againſt Epiſcopacy, and the Ceremonies which had been introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb facs="tcp:119100:6"/>
amongſt them, to the great prejudice of their Ancient Church governement and Diſcipline. But here it may not be forgotten, how, when the <hi>Parliament</hi> of famous memory that was convened eighteen yeares agoe, having taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their pious conſideration the condition of our own Church at home, and judging that a further reformation in matters of Religion, then had been made in the daies of <hi>Queen Elizabeth,</hi> was neceſſary, and ſetting upon that work, as alſo the vindication of the liberties of this <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, were forced to take up Armes for their own defence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that Partie, that could not brooke the Reformation, which they intended. And to what an height that oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion grew in after time, and with what difficulties they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted for many years together, becauſe they would not give up that cauſe, they had undertaken to defend, is ſo well known to even ſuch as may be but ſtrangers in our <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> that we may ſpare the pains of a full recitall. But yet nothing of all this is to be wondered at; Satan muſt needs <note place="margin">Rev. 12. 12.</note> be like himſelfe, and ſtir the more when he ſees his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome begin to ſhake: And corruption will rage when it is croſſed. God alſo hath a wiſe hand in theſe oppoſitions, not only thereby the more inflaming the zeal and brightning up other graces in his faithfull ſervants, trying and exerciſing <note place="margin">Dan. 11. 35. Jam. 1. 2, 3. 1 Pet. 1. 6, 7. and 4. 12. Rev. 13. 10.</note> their faith and patience, the purging and purifying and making them white; but alſo getting himſelf the greater glory, when his worke is carried on, notwithſtanding the greateſt oppoſition of his and his Churches enemies. And here we cannot but with all thankfullneſs to Almighty God, take notice of this hand, that was moſt eminently lifted up in the worke of Reformation begun by that late foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned <hi>Parliament,</hi> as there is cauſe, why alſo we ſhould to the honour and glory of his great Name, and the praiſe of that <hi>Parliament,</hi> unto the generations that may come here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, acknowledg their unwearied pains, courage, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy
<pb facs="tcp:119100:7"/>
in that worke. Much was done, yea very much by that illuſtrious and worthy <hi>Parliament.</hi> By them the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of reformation was laid in the ſolemne League and Covenant, which they not only took themſelves, but or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained ſhould be <hi>ſolemnely taken in all places throughout the Kingdome of England, and Dominion of Wales.</hi> And for the better and more orderly taking thereof appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and injoyned certain directions to be ſtrictly follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And in purſuance of this League and Covenant (en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gageing <note place="margin">See the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Lords and Commons Aſſembled in <hi>Parliament,</hi> with inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the taking the League and Covenant in the Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> and Dominion of <hi>Wales.</hi>
               </note> every one that tooke it, <hi>in their ſeverall places to indeavour the refomation of Religion in England and Ireland in Doctrine, Worſhip, Diſcipline and governement, according to the word of God, and the example of the beſt reformed Churches, and to bring the Churches of God in the three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes to the neareſt conjunction and uniformity of Religion, Confeſsion of Faith, forme of Church Government, Directory for worſhip and Catechizing.)</hi> After conſultation had <hi>with the Reverend, Pious, and Learned Aſſembly of Divines called to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to that purpoſe, they judged it neceſſary that the Book of Common Prayer ſhould be aboliſhed, and the Directory for the publick worſhip of God, and in their Ordinance mentioned, ſhould be eſtabliſhed and obſerved in all the Churches within this Land,</hi> as appears by their Ordinance of <hi>January</hi> the 3. 1644. for that purpoſe. By them <hi>Prelacy, that is, Church Government by Archbiſhops, Biſhops, their Chancellors and Commiſſaries, Deanes, Deanes and Chapters, Archdeacons, and all other Eccleſiaſticall Officers depending on that Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,</hi> was extirpated according to that Covenant, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the Ordinance they paſſed <hi>October</hi> the 9. 1646. for the aboliſhing Archbiſhops and Biſhops within the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>England,</hi> and Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> By them alſo after the paſſing of ſeverall Ordinances for the ſetling of the Presbyterian Governments by parts before, at length that progreſs was by them made in that work, that they paſſed
<pb facs="tcp:119100:7"/>
the Ordinance of 1648. eſtabliſhing the <hi>forme of Church Government to be uſed in the Church of England after advice had with the Aſſembly of Divines.</hi> By their authority, and according to the rules and directions by them given for that purpoſe, they ſetled the Presbyterian Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Province of <hi>London,</hi> and in this Province of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caster,</hi> and in ſome other parts of the Land, whereby they ſufficiently awarranted thoſe, that ſhould act therein accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Ordinances, that they are ſecured againſt that danger of a <hi>Premunire,</hi> with which ſome (as will appear from the following Papers) hath been threatned. What obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons this work of reformation ſo happily begun, did after meet with from ſeverall Parties, or how it came to paſſe, that this Government was ſetled throughout the Land, we are not willing here ſo much as to mention, deſiring rather in ſilence to acknowledge the righteous Hand of God, in bringing us back again into the wilderneſſe of confuſion, to wander there for ſeverall years together, when we had been upon the borders of a juſt ſettlement, and thereby correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an unthankfull people, and unwilling to be reformed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Covenant, then by making complaints a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any, to ſeem to murmur at his juſt diſpenſation; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially conſidering, that we are not without hope, but that the wiſe and mercifull God may have reſerved the honour of finiſhing this work and building upon that foundation, which was by them laid in troublous times for a fitter ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, when the people of this Nation, having been convinced of the miſchiefs and miſeries of an ungoverned Church by the long want of Church Government in it, may be the more ready to give the more chearfull entertainmant to what may be eſtabliſhed by ſome after<hi>-Parliament.</hi> And who can tell, but the <hi>hands</hi> of ſundry of the ſame <hi>Zerubba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels,</hi> that <hi>laid the foundation</hi> of this work, their hands may <note place="margin">Zach 4. 9.</note> alſo finiſh it? But however thus we ſee, that the worke
<pb facs="tcp:119100:8"/>
of reformation, and particularly of Churches and Nations, is not a work that goes on eaſily, it meeteth with oppoſition, not only often from enemies, but ſometimes even from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed friends. And if that <hi>Parliament</hi> that caſt out Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, and eſtabliſhed the Presbyterian Government in the room thereof, did not carry on that worke ſo far, but through much difficulty; it is not to be thought ſtrange, if the ſame ſpirit of oppoſition, that they wreſtled with, ſhould after they were riſen, diſcover it ſelfe to the interrupting and hindering of thoſe that acted upon their Ordinances, in the exerciſe of that Government and Diſcipline, which they ſo eſtabliſhed. We cannot but imagine, that ſundry through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Land have reaſon to complaine of the like, if not far worſe, then we have met with. But as touching our ſelves it was our publiſhing a ſhort Paper in our ſeverall Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and herewith Printed, that was the occaſion of thoſe conteſts betwixt us and the Gentlemen we have to deale with, that are now made publick to the world. What the deſigne of that Paper was, we leave it to all indifferent perſons to conſider, nothing doubting but that all equall judges will conclude, it was very honeſt, and did not merit ſuch unhandſome handling, as it after met with. But how matters after proceeded betwixt us and the Gentlemen that aſſaulted it, untill without our privity and conſent both that and other Papers, that after paſſed on both ſides, were by them Printed, our Narrative following will give a full account; whereby alſo it will be evident, that we are forced into the field for our own defence, as it will be further ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt to every Reader from the Papers themſelves, which we here publiſh, we are meerly on the defenſive part. And if the Reader be pleaſed to take notice from our Narrative, that it was in <hi>July</hi> laſt that we firſt met with all the Papers in Print; and further obſerve thence, that we had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time in a treaty with them, touching a meeting
<pb facs="tcp:119100:8"/>
in order to an accommodation, during which time, we had not any thoughts of returning any Anſwer in writing to their laſt Papers; and that notwithſtanding our ſeverall other employments in the meane ſeaſon, our Anſwer to thoſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers had fully paſſed the Claſs <hi>November</hi> the 23. of this ſame Year, as appears by the date they beare, according to the ſubſcription of them by the Moderator; we cannot conceive that he will judge, we have neglected any time that could with conveniency have been redeemed for the haſtening our Anſwer abroad in the world. And now untill they ſee the light, the tranſcribing them faire for the Preſs, and the Printing of them, drinkes up the remainder of the time. All that we have now further to acquaint the Reader with; is to give him an account of ſome things in reference to what we here publiſh. We have Printed over again all the Papers that formerly paſſed betwixt them and us, becauſe we could not anſwer ſeverall things in theirs, without ſome ſpeciall reference to both their Papers and ours; and we judged it to be the faireſt way to preſent all entirely to the Readers view, that thereby he might be able the better to judg con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the whole, eſpecially conſidering what we now pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, might perhaps come into the hands of ſundry, that had never ſeen what had been before by them Printed. We have not omitted to Print the Title given by them to the Papers, as they were by them publiſhed, that by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their Papers with their Title, and our examination of them, together with that taſt we give in the cloſe, of that ſpirit they diſcover in them, the Reader may the better judge, how their diſcourſe doth ſuit with the Title given to it. We have alſo therewith again Printed their Preface, that they might not have any occaſion to ſay of us, that we had a mind to ſuppreſs any thing of theirs, which they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps might judg materiall; though from our Narrative and Animadverſions on this their Preface in the cloſe of that
<pb facs="tcp:119100:9"/>
our Narrative, the weight that is in it will be tried. The Paper which we publiſhed in our Congregations, and that followes our Narrative, though approved by the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall, yet being directed only to the Congregations of our own Aſſociation, was drawn up ſhort, being for the uſe of thoſe that were not altogether ſtrangers to the Diſcipline, it having been practiſed amongſt them for ſeverall yeares before; and the rules whereof, as they are more fully and particularly held forth in the forme of Church Government eſtabliſhed by the <hi>Parliament,</hi> ſo had been more fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to them in our publick Miniſtry, as there hath been occaſion. But here we muſt further acquaint the Reader, that the errours and depravations of this Paper, which we found in it, as it had been by them Printed, we have rectifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (as we well might) according to the Originall, and now exhibit it to the Readers view, as it was when it paſſed from us. We have Printed their firſt Paper, as we found it Printed by themſelves, only we have added the reſt of the Names that were ſubſcribed to it, when it was preſented unto us, that ſo thoſe that were repreſented to us as the ſubſcribers of it, may own it or diſown it as they ſee cauſe. We have divided our Anſwer to their firſt Paper into eleaven Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as alſo the laſt Paper of theirs (on which we Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert) into the like number, that ſo by comparing all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it may be the better diſcerned, how they have dealt with us, what they reply to and what they omit; and we leave the whole, together with our Animadverſions on the ſeverall Sections of theirs, to be judged of by the Reader. We have alſo Printed their two laſt Papers, as we found them Printed by themſelves, and have noted in the Margents of them both the variations (which yet are not great) from the Copies, that were preſented unto us, and whereof the letters <hi>Cl.</hi> and <hi>Cop.</hi> prefixed to thoſe variations (and intimating how it was in thoſe Copies, that were exhibited to the Claſs) are
<pb facs="tcp:119100:9"/>
an indicium or the ſign. We confeſs our Anſwers to their two laſt Papers are now grown to a greater bulke then we firſt intended, or then what ſome perhaps may judge neceſſary; but we wiſh it might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, that if ſome things that fall into debate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them and us, be not of generall concerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet the diſcuſſion of them being of uſe for our vindication, and the diſcovering unto them their errours and faults, we conceive that in thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects it was requiſite; although the Reader may find ſeverall things ſpoken to, that be of common uſe, and whereof we give him ſome account at the end of this Epiſtle, as alſo where they may be found; that ſuch as have not either leiſure or will to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe the whole, may take a view more ſpeedily, of what they may chiefly deſire to read. When we were to give our reaſons, why we could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to admit of Epiſcopacy moderated, we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that the point touching Epiſcopacy having been ſo fully diſcuſſed by farre abler Pens, we thought it might be the fitteſt for us to inſiſt chiefly upon the inconveniency and dangerouſneſſe of that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and what we in this Land and the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Nation had experienced in thoſe reſpects. In another place we urge ſome Arguments to prove a Biſhop and a Presbyter to be, in a Scripture ſenſe of thoſe words, all one. What is ſpoken touching the <hi>Jus divinum</hi> of the ruling Elders Office was occaſioned from the Texts we had urged (though it was but by the way) in our Anſwer to their firſt Paper, and their excepting in their ſecond, againſt our alledging thoſe Texts for that purpoſe. But we do here profeſſe, that we do not diſcuſſe that point our ſelves; we only tranſcribe what is ſolidly and
<pb facs="tcp:119100:10"/>
fully done concerning it to our hands, by other Reverend and Learned Brethren; and therefore when in our Title we men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the clearing up of the <hi>Jus divinum</hi> of the ruling Elders Office, the Reader is ſo to underſtand that branch of it, as when we come to ſpeak of that point particularly, we there give him our reaſons of that tranſcription. We have now no more to acquaint the Reader with, and therefore ſhall leave the whole to his peruſall, not much mattering the cenſures of looſe and prophane ſpirits; though we hope with ſuch as are unprejudiced and zealous for reformation, our endeavours ſhall find ſome acceptance. And having the Teſtimonie of our conſciences that in the uprightneſs of our hearts, we have aimed at the Glory of God and the good of his Church, in what we now ſend abroad into the world, we do not que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, but that God, who is the trier of the hearts and reines, and the God of truth, will not only own that good old cauſe of his, in the defence whereof ſo many of his faithfull Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants have ſuffered in former times, but us alſo the meaneſt and unworthieſt of his Servants, in this our ſtanding up for it, and ſo bleſs our labours herein, that they may be of ſome uſe for the publique good. The Father of Lights, and God of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Prince of Peace give unto us all, and to all His, the ſpirit of wiſdome and revelation, in the knowledge of his Will, guide our feet in the waies of Peace, and after our manifold and great ſhakings, ſettle the Affairs both of Church and State upon ſome ſure foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, to the Glory of his own great Name, and the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Comfort, Peace, and Wellfare of all his People. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                           <p>To ſatisfie us in our ſcruples, and in their proceedings, they pretend for what they do, both an Eccleſiaſticall and civill ſanction; a Commiſſion from Chriſt and the State al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo.

                              </gap>, Our own Laws built upon paſſion and intereſt, are commonly lawleſs. It is apparent to us, that their new Lights have no light from Antiquity or Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive forms; that their new Rules have no eſtabliſhment, either by the Laws of the Chriſtian Church, or the Laws of this Land. St. <hi>Jerome</hi> ſaid of <hi>Origen,</hi> 
                              <q>That <hi>ingenii ſui acumina putat eccleſiae eſſe Sacramenta;</hi> an imagination ſure of our Presbyters, that the <hi>placita</hi> of their own wils muſt paſs for civill and divine conſtitutions.</q> We wonder that men pretending to Learning and Religion, ſhould not only call in the Lord of truth to abett the the phanſies of men, but ſhould alſo pretend to encouragement and Commiſſions from the State, to ſecond their prevarications.</p>
                           <p>It hath pleaſed his Highneſs in his wiſdome and clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, to ſecure all godly and peaceable men profeſſing Jeſus Chriſt, from thoſe Ordinances which the rigour of Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry had mounted againſt them; but where he gives the leaſt incouragement for this power uſurped by them, we find not; and therefore we thinke 'tis friendly advice that they take heed leaſt their unguided zeal, or intereſt precipitate them into a Premunire, ſince under colour of authority, they have made Laws and Canons, and publiſhed them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly in the Church, for all to obey, upon pain of excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication; not only againſt all the ancient known Laws of el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der date, but alſo contrary to the preſent eſtabliſhment and
<pb facs="tcp:119100:13"/>
the Magiſtracy under which we now live.</p>
                           <p>'Tis a trouble to us, to hear them cry out againſt Prelacy and Epiſcopacy, as only an artificiall and politicall device to Lord it over Gods inheritance, whereas indeed their lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle fingers are heavier then the Prelates loines; though they tell us their way is friendly, meek, and a ſociall way, we find it not; they make us only as Publicans and Heathens; it ſhould ſeem that all that they intended in the change of Church Government, was only to ſlice the Dioceſan into Parochiall Biſhops; and with him in <hi>Lucian,</hi> To cut out the old uſeleſs Moons into fine new Stars, every one of which claime the ſame influence and dominion over the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple which the Prelates did.</p>
                           <p>'Tis a trouble to us, to hear them inveigh againſt Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, and Schiſmaticks, againſt the Novatian and Donatiſts of old, when they walk in their ſteps, maintain their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and eſpouſe their quarrels. We are told by the Church Hiſtorians, That the Doctrine againſt mixt-communion, was a Brat gotten by <hi>Novatus,</hi> nurſt up by <hi>Lucifer</hi> and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,</hi> but it grew not till <hi>Donatus</hi> became its foſter Father: then indeed it flouriſht and ſpread amain, till St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> by his judicious and clear oppoſition did baniſh it, that, and the ſubfequent ages; the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> of the laſt age called it back into <hi>Germany, Quod aruit in ſe refloruit in ill is;</hi> they grafted upon the old ſtock, and wanted nothing of the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſticks,</hi> but to be called ſo. Now amongſt other of their dangerous and erroneous principles, <hi>Bullinger</hi> notes this for one of the chief, <hi>De Doctrinâ caenae ſcrupuloſè quaerunt Anabaptiſtae, quorum cauſâ caena dominica ſit inſtituta?</hi> They were nice and ſcrupulous, and inquiſitive concerning the Lords Supper, concluding it was only to be given to the Saints, and concluding the Saints to their own folds.</p>
                           <p>This is the direct practiſe of the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries;
<pb facs="tcp:119100:14"/>
bytery; becauſe the Parliament formerly, and now his Highneſs, in their wiſdom and prudence have ſo blunted the edge of their ſecular power, that they cannot hurt us with that, they flye to their religious ſhifts, and what <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſaid of <hi>Goliah's</hi> Sword, ſurely they ſay of the holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, <hi>Ther's none like unto that;</hi> no Engine ſo likely to teach us obedience, and to give them the ſoveraignty, as that. They impale the Supper of Chriſt to their own Incloſures, and as abſolute Judges of all Communicants, keep back all perſons that have not their Shibboleth ready, that will not fall down and worſhip that Idol which they have ſet up. The <hi>Aegyptians</hi> were hard Taskmaſters, to expect the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould make Bricks, and make Straw too, to require the ſame number of Bricks without Materials to make them of: this is ſomething like the ſeverity of our new Maſters, they cenſure for not doing that which they render to us impoſſible. If we come not to the Lords Supper, we muſt be excommunicate; and they will not permit us to come, becauſe we are ignorant, or ſcandalous, or prophane; and 'tis proof enough we are ſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are too ſtout to fall down and worſhip their ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations.</p>
                           <p>'Tis a trouble to us, that men who impropriate to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the name of Saints, and would have the world to thinke them the only Chriſtians, ſhould be ſo farre from that <gap reason="foreign">

                              </gap>, that meekneſs and ſweetneſſe of the Goſpell, that they are ſtill of the old Legall ſpirit, to era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate and deſtroy all that are not of their way: Inſtead of ſweetning and indearing the ſpirits of men, that they may come to the knowledge of the truth and be ſaved, they ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritate and imbitter them by their two bold judging in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, and by their fierce and ſevere cenſures in publick, as if indeed it were their worke to deliver them up unto Satan.</p>

Theſe things have forc'd us contrary to our own diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and inclinations, to appear in publick, not only for our own vindication, but in defence of Eccleſiaſticall and civill conſtitutions, well hoping that theſe mean indeavours will encourage ſome worthy and learned Champions to take up Arms for the defence of that cauſe which we love: what we have done, <hi>quale quale ſit,</hi> what ever it be, inaſmuch as in the ſincerity of our hearts we profeſs 'tis done, <hi>ſine ullo ſtudio contentionis,</hi> without any pleaſure or delight in contention, but only for the love of truth, we hope our good God will give it a more gracious ſucceſs, and good men will give it a more charitable reception.</p>

                     <hi>Moſely,</hi> &amp;c. the which was read; and becauſe in the latter end of it they hinted their unſatisfiedneſs in what was alledged in our Papers, in Anſwer to their firſt, for the proof of our authority for the exerciſe of the preſent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, from the Law of the Land now in force, they having charged us before with the danger of a <hi>Praemunire:</hi> The Claſs reſolved to wave any other matter, tendred in this laſt Paper, till they made out their exceptions in that thing. And this Anſwer was returned to the foreſaid Gentlemen, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Claſs did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire they would make out what they ſeemed to aſſert, againſt the validity of our acting in the Presbyterian Government, by virtue of civill Authority.</p>
               </note> On <hi>March</hi> 9. ſome of the foreſaid Gentlemen brought in their ſecond Paper, which was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verture for an accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, though with an awfull threat, what they would do at our Paper, if that took not; eſpecially in reſpect of the civill Sanction for our Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; upon which the Claſs, becauſe they had in their Paper (which they ſtill perſiſt to do, as in their Printed Preface) threatned us with the danger of a <hi>Premunire,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, that they would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they went any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, let us underſtand what ſtrength they had to bring in againſt what we had alledged for the civill authority for our government. For all ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall men may eaſily conceive, that this thing was fit to be firſt diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. For if we had no more authority for our Government, then they had for theirs, the terms of our accommodation might and ought to be much otherwiſe, then when we conceived ours was ſetled by expreſs au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>authority,
<pb facs="tcp:119100:18"/>
and theirs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as expreſs an inhibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and exception. This deſire therefore was ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to them in faire language, and nothing further put upon them in Anſwer to our Paper, then what they threatned us ſo much with, <hi>viz.</hi> that they would impart unto us, what they had (in which they put ſo much confidence) againſt what we had brought for our acting by the civill authority. This An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of ours was taken in great indignation by them; and though what they have ſaid in their largeſt Paper about this thing, might have been held in leſſe then a ſingle Sheet, and for ought we can ſee in ſome few lines; yet upon this, they draw up an Anſwer (ſuch an one as they are willing the world ſhould ſee what it is,) to our whole Paper, as they ſay. And their ſpirit was ſo chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe we did not take their firſt motion, upon the very terms it was tendered by them, that they bring in their
<pb facs="tcp:119100:19"/>
third Paper, wherein for all their dear love profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the former Paper, they returned to them more naturall ſtraine of ſcorn, bitterneſs, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſion of us, though they were ſo modeſt as to leave out their laughing at us in the Copy they Printed. <note n="i" place="margin">

                     <hi>Harriſon</hi> who had brought the Anſwer of the Claſs to the Gentlemen, that day they had preſented their Paper, Anſwered that he mentioned both unto them as mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to be diſcourſed of.

                     <hi>Moſely</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, they had not Miniſters within the Claſs to equallize the number, that the Claſs might nominate: and that therefore he deſired on the behalf of the re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>, that they might take others, that were not within the bounds of the Claſs. To which the Committee returned Anſwer, they might then take M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

                     <hi>Pollet,</hi> that were two Miniſters, that had ſubſcribed the firſt Paper, and the Claſs would appoint two Miniſters only on their behalf to meet theſe, and ſome Elders to meet with the like number of Gentlemen to be by them nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.

The ful diſcourſe between ſome employed from the Committee to him, and him, you have at large in the other Columne from the Records of the Claſs, Mr <hi>Moſely</hi> would have the matter of the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation to be the only buſineſs of the future meeting; we alledged that we ſhould expect ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the Papers, as well as that, becauſe we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived our ſelves much injured in their laſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. Mr. <hi>Moſely</hi> expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed himſelf very deſirous of peace; and if the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of accommodation might take place, he
<pb facs="tcp:119100:20"/>
could wiſh all the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers were burned, and that if any wrong was done, he would make ſatisfaction at the Market Croſſe; the Committee then were willing to wave the matter of the Papers to the ſecond place, and if the accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation did not take place then, that the Paper ſhould be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed on.

               </note> Which Letter was taken to him forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. He told the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger he would wait upon Mr. <hi>Heyricke</hi> (to whom the Anſwer was to be returned) the next day, which he accordingly did, and brought Mr. <hi>Moſely</hi> with him. He ſaid he knew not of
<pb facs="tcp:119100:21"/>
the Printing of the Papers, and therefore had brought Mr. <hi>Moſely,</hi> who could give the account of this amicable Office of Printing all the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, whilſt an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation was on foot. Mr <hi>Moſely</hi> ſaid ſomething to Mr. <hi>Heyricke,</hi> that it ſhould be reported that he ſhould ſay, that he could wiſh all the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers were burnt; and ſo to vindicate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſted not their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, they Printed them to the world.—Which Anſwer of his, if it had come, or the like from us, it ſhould have been cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſilly and poore, if not worſe. But for thoſe words which he ſpake, we know none that ever repeated them, or that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly did it, or that ever took them in the ſenſe he himſelf puts upon them. We only took notice of them, as a zealous expreſſion of his hearty forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb facs="tcp:119100:22"/>
for peace (which it ſeems we wronged him in, and we muſt deſire him <hi>to forgive us this wrong)</hi> and not as in any diſtruſt on their part of their Papers, for they never wanted confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and a conceit to the utmoſt, of the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of all they did, and do not yet; ſo that we could never, knowing their whole carriage in the buſineſs, miſtake their words ſo far, to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of any retraction on their part, of any thing they had written. But for this to be the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of their Printing, we account it a poor ſhift to alledge it; they might ſure have enquired of us, (when upon tearmes of Peace eſpecially) whether any of us would have owned any ſuch words in ſuch a ſenſe, before they had Printed the Papers upon them; and what was the occaſion before theſe words were ſpoken, that many of their Party did ſo frequently talke of Printing the Papers, if they had not been Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb facs="tcp:119100:22"/>
but for them? But the truth is, theſe men (the only men ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with Religion, Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Antiquity) conceit ſome great advantage they have gotten by their Papers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Government, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhall perſwade them to keep that under though they accommodate never ſo with the Congregations where it is practiſed, or rather that it was a meere pretence in them to an accommodation, when they deal thus underhand in open hoſtility, is but too manifeſt.</p>
            <p>But Mr <hi>Heyricke</hi> moved that he might have their Anſwer in writing, that he might return it to the Claſs, as appointed by them to receive it. They promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed they would within a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night: Within that time Mr <hi>Allen</hi> came, and denied to return any Anſwer in writing, though he had promiſed it, and though he did not know of the Printing of the Papers (as he ſaies) with the Preface: yet now it is done, they muſt own it, to prevent a breach amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; reſolved they are to keep Peace amongſt themſelves, though with us they deal accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Tenent, <hi>of keeping no faith with Hereticks,</hi> whilſt they cry up themſelves as the only Patrons of the Proteſtant Cauſe: and all others but as Punies to them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:119100:23"/>
What iniquity (humane infirmity ſet aſide) can any find in this, or in our actings? If in any thing we have tranſgreſſed, it is, that our actings did not ſucceed our purpoſes; <hi>forgive us this wrong,</hi> and for the future we engage our ſelves, (all Bug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beares ſet aſide) to act according to our repreſentation, not <note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 13.</note> ſpending more time in perſwading them, that will not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded.</p>
            <p>Having thus given a faithfull account of the riſe and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of theſe proceedings, which is all we ſhall ſay by way of Preface on our part; we ſhall take leave, (after a word up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Title under which they have Printed the Papers) to make ſome brief Animadverſions upon ſome paſſages in the Preface, which they have prefixed.</p>
            <p>For the Title they give to the Papers as Printed by them, and what they further ſay in their Title Page.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt they call it <hi>Excommunicatio excommunieata;</hi> Here is flat Eraſtianiſme in the Front, though it is but a Maske to to cover Prelacy under. For though they ſeem to be againſt all excommunication, unleſs it be the totall excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Ordinance out of the Church: yet after we finde them willing that the Dioceſan Biſhops ſhould excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate. Beſides this contradiction, it is wonder how this comes to be the Title of the Book; for unleſs they had done more in their Papers, which might appear to be of unqueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable ſtrength, and directly againſt that Ordinance (though as Adminiſtred according to the Presbyterian Government) they do ſeem to ſet up the Gates of <hi>Mindas</hi> in this great Title.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They ſay, Wherein is <hi>modeſtly examined.</hi> Let the Reader judg, whether what they offer, be worthy to be called an <hi>examination</hi> of what we have at firſt publiſhed, or ſince Anſwered to theirs, or to the matter in the whole. For their <hi>modeſty,</hi> ſure they either have another notion of modeſty, then is ordinary; or elſe they ſoon forget what they here aſſert: if untruths, reproaches, revilings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſavour of modeſty, let the Reader judg to call our's an <hi>uſurped power,</hi> and to determine ſo peremptorily upon the matter of the whole Controverſie, ſavours not of over much modeſty, in
<pb facs="tcp:119100:23"/>
the very next Lines; and if they have carried the matter like <hi>diſſenting Chriſtians,</hi> we deſire the Reader to believe, as he finds reaſon to judge upon the peruſall of the whole.</p>
            <div type="commentary_on_preface">
               <head>For the Preface,</head>
               <p>1. They do firſt inſinuate to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an Apology for their appearing in Print, profeſſiug 1. their own diſpoſition to Peace, and 2. how much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their wills they have been forced to this courſe. For the former of theſe, while they talke of <hi>Solomons</hi> rule; for <hi>prudent men to keep ſilence,</hi> they ſhew themſelves in the Quotation unacquainted with Scripture, as in their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, with the rule here mentioned, they are afraid to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Title of <hi>Scripturiſts;</hi> yet ſure it would not have been to their diſhonour, if among their flouriſhes with humane Authors, this our poore Text had been truly quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, when they call it <hi>Solomons</hi> Rule, and it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Prophets, <hi>Amos</hi> 5. 13. But if they had been touched at all with any <hi>tenderneſs of vexing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and diſquieting others, with ſuch empty diſcourſes, as rather enlarge then compoſe the differences of Gods Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> would they ever (if they think the matter of theſe Papers to be ſuch) have been ſo eager for Printing? when they might well have forborne and were, we thinke, by their pretenſions of Peace with us, in reaſon and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity bound to have done. They pretend to be about to be at Peace with us, and to what then, but the <hi>wide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Gods Peoples differences,</hi> are the Papers Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? And indeed we care not for any thing more, (if we know our own hearts,) in this action of theirs, that troubles us, then that the differences of the Church are hereby enlarged, and the mindes of Gods People diverted, by new controverſies, and old ones almoſt ſilenced, newly dreſt up, from that ſtudy of their own hearts, and the power of godlineſs, of which there is ſuch a decay in the whole Land at this day.</p>
               <p>And 2. In that they wovld have the World believe, that they were forced to this courſe by the ſevere and injurious
<pb facs="tcp:119100:24"/>
dealings they have met with from <hi>their Brethren</hi> (as they are here pleaſed to ſtile us) <hi>of the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:</hi> And whereas they ſay, that <hi>in this age of Printing, wherein men of low and cheap abilities take as much confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence as any to appeare in publique, and that it had been more honourable for their Brethren and themſelves, to have made their liſts more private; For ſo we had determined our ignorance to our own spheare, and our defects had been vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to no eyes but our own.</hi> We muſt needs herein pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe our wonder at them. They might have ſaved themſelves the trouble, and ſo the need of the Apology, for their appearing in publique, when they ſeemed to embrace an accommodation between us; as when <hi>Aulus Albinus</hi> made an Apology for writing the <hi>Romane</hi> Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in Greeke, becauſe he was not ſo well verſed in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> that tongue. <hi>Cato</hi> told him he was in love with a fault that he had rather aske pardon, then be innocent: We believe, as they, that it might have been more honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable on both ſides to have <hi>made our liſt more private,</hi> and we by our Narrative would let the world know how we came in publique: without queſtion they have no <hi>ignorance to be determined to their own ſpheare, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, they feare to be made viſible to others eyes,</hi> (becauſe not ſo to their own) or they would never have runne this hazard, when the power was wholly in their own hands to have prevented it. But it is our <hi>ignorance and defects,</hi> which they are loath to conceale, which makes a neceſſity of their Printing, the <hi>honour of their Brethren</hi> being a matter, they are no waies tender of. But they go on to inſinuate, what neceſſity hath begot this vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in them; a neceſſity indeed, as much from us to force them to do it, as it is virtue in them in what they have done. Truely while they complaine of <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asperations and bitterneſſe, &amp;c.</hi> That <hi>hath begot in them this courage, and provok't them to combate whether they will or no;</hi> we muſt needs profeſſe our ignorance of what they meane, being conſcious to our ſelves of no ſuch

carriages towards them, their provocation to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate is juſt, as he is provok't to ſet upon his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, towards whom he pretends friendſhip, when he apprehends he hath an advantage againſt him, to do him a miſchief; ſo they, when they had agreed upon a Treaty for accommodation, Print our Papers, upon a conceipt (no doubt) of an advantage they had gotten a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, which yet we are not frighted with, and we leave the Reader to diſcern of; and for the Papers, let the impartiall Reader judge, whether they have forborne us any thing in theirs, that may juſtly be termed <hi>bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs and exaſperation;</hi> and whether in ours they have Printed, we have rendred <hi>railing for railing,</hi> or no; <hi>what blow we ever gave them on the one cheeke,</hi> or what we had prepared for the other, we are yet ignorant in our ſelves of: But may truely returne their words upon themſelves, for our appearing now in publique: <hi>It was a thing we intended not, and could for ſome reaſons, have wiſhed had not been, but their exasperations and bitterneſs,</hi> not only privately vented towards us, in their Papers tendered to us, but now publiſhed, <hi>hath provoked us to this publique combate, whether we will or no.</hi> They expect not (we know) that we ſhould be ſilent, for we have our blow on both cheekes already; firſt in their Papers, pretty well ſtuffed (for the bulke of them) with ſcoffs and bitter revilings, and now again in their publiſhing, their affronting us to all the world; and we wiſh that this carriage of theirs from firſt to laſt, had been ſuch as might have ſavoured of the <hi>Chriſtian in any Calender.</hi> For what Anſwer their <hi>ſilence might have been to the pretenſions of our power, and diſguiſes of our popular diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, and our harſh proceedings towards them,</hi> &amp;c. We know the charge herein againſt us, to be ſo unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably groundleſſe, that we thinke their ſilence might have been a ſufficient Anſwer, and all they were neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitated to make, by any provocation we ever gave them, and yet we crave leave to tell them, for any alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb facs="tcp:119100:25"/>
their confident writing (either ſince it was firſt tendered to us, or after Printed) hath begotten in our judgements, for the way we have engaged in, their ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence might have ſerv'd the turne ſtill. For what we thought of their ſilence, that either it was becauſe they could not, or would not ſpeake, they know (it ſeems) better then we. If they will leave us our conſciences to <hi>witneſs</hi> with us, we have our <hi>Thouſands</hi> as well as they, to witneſs for our thoughts in this thing againſt what they ſay of us; unleſs we had known we had juſtly provoked them, or had at all entrencht upon them, we need not ſpend our thoughts about their abilities or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs for oppoſition. We have no cauſe to feare their flattery, unleſſe it be when they uſe us ſo injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, and yet call themſelves our Friends; We thinke not much <hi>that they ſpeake the truth they understand, and we joyne in the Prayer, that the good spirit would lead them and us into all truth;</hi> yet we queſtion the neceſſity and ſeaſonableneſſe of their profeſſion; eſpecially when the thing they contend for, was not in the Paper we publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, at all oppugned. What <hi>their pride and envy, or hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty deſire of Peace in this</hi> (as they call it) <hi>inconſiderable ſervice may be,</hi> when they Print to the world our dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference ſo ſurreptitiouſly, nay (as we may call it) perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly; when a meeting for an accommodation was agreed upon, we leave it to God over <hi>their thouſand witneſſes within them</hi> to judg.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They go on now to repreſent their grievances, which made them open their mouths, and tell the world, they will not <hi>repreſent the Roomes and Modell of the whole Houſe in the Porch;</hi> though we thinke, the Preface, for confident preſuming the ground of the controverſies, cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoriouſneſſe, bitterneſſe, and unfaithfull repreſenting mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of fact, may well be the Porch to this Houſe; and if not a modell of the whole on their part, yet a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent additionall Roome uniforme to the whole pile. They here ſpeake out what made them open their mouths, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:119100:25"/>
that they ſhould <hi>not ſeem to feare the Giant of Presbytery,</hi> whereby they acquit us from acting any thing contrary to the Rules of Presbytery, but it is the Governement it ſelfe they quarrell at. If therefore we have declared nothing but what is ſuitable to the perſwaſion of the Brethren of the Presbyteriall way, Why ſhould this be more complained of in us, then they would thinke well we ſhould complaine of them, in what they have ſaid (as they ſay) according to their judgement in defence of Epiſcopacy? And what is this, but a deſire to revive the quarrell, when ſo much is ſaid on both ſides already by abler hands? And they bring no new thing to light for their way, nor put us to ſay any thing but what is ſaid already. But for their manner of expreſſing themſelves, and dreſſing up the controverſie, wherein indeed for bitterneſſe and uncivility, we finde them ſingular; they are affraid the world ſhould thinke they did not enough undervalue Presbytery; and ſo they would have it to know, that Presbytery in their thoughts is not the only <hi>Palladium</hi> to preſerve the City of God. We ſhould thinke that men that had any reall zeale for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of Chriſt, ſhould not wiſh him a King in his Church without a Diſcipline and Government; and whether this hedge be not ſo neceſſary to the preſervation of the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, we would wiſh all ſober perſons to conſider. The City of God hath not long ſtood in any place, where the Arke of God hath been taken, and the glory of <hi>Iſraell</hi> departed from it. A Governement in the Church, if they do not make it the <hi>Palladium</hi> to the City of God, we know not what is; and for the <hi>Government they contend for,</hi> it being under an expreſſe prohibition, by the forme of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement and the humble Advice, ſo that to ſtrive for that, is to ſtrive for none; if they had the judging of us by ſuch a circumſtance, they would not ſtick to ſay, that we ſtrove for Anarchy in the Church, whileſt we refuſed a Governement ſetled, with which we might accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date, under pretence for one we more fancied, that was quite aboliſhed, and by the Law expreſly excepted. And
<pb facs="tcp:119100:26"/>
we take leave further to tell them, that we know ſome god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Miniſters in ſome other parts of this Nation, that are of the Epiſcopall way, that notwithſtanding their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in judgement with us, yet would heartily cloſe with the Presbyterian Governement, and would account it a mercy to have it ſetled with them, as it is with us, and this, rather then any other beſides their own, rather then to have the Church of God lye in ſuch Anarchy, as in moſt part of the Nation it doth at this day. And whether the ſettlement of Government, and as matters now ſtand of this very Government, may deſervedly be lookt upon, as the <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladium of the City of God,</hi> we wiſh the ſuddain experience of the miſeries from the want of it, may not turne their ſcoffe into a ſad experiment.</p>

In the Narrative they give of our proceedings as the great matter of their grievance; We ſhall not ſay much to the ſcoffes and jeeres, they put upon the thing publiſhed by us; whether under the notion of <hi>Breviat,</hi> or what terme elſe they pleaſe to give it; but that what we publiſhed ſhould be chiefly againſt them, that withdrew from the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and that it ſhould be intended againſt them of their judgment eſpecially, we leave the Paper to the impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall Reader to ſpeake for it ſelfe. Whether our Paper doth not concerne the ignorant, for their inſtruction only, which to the Miniſters is a matter of great pains, and not for the cenſuring of them; and the ſcandalous for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, by admonition and (if need require) further juſt cenſure (both which ſorts we hope they would not ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der uncurable, let them be of what judgment they will) let any one judg: And that the Rule that we declared to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in towards thoſe that did not come to the Sacrament, did neither principally much leſs only, concerne them of their way; we may truly profeſs they were leaſt in our eye; but the generality of our people, that are no more for their way of government, then for ours, but in generall for none at all; theſe we deſired to exhort to minde their duty about the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and though we have met with unhandſome uſage
<pb facs="tcp:119100:26"/>
from ſome of theſe men that have thus appeared againſt us, yet we have ſeen ſome good fruits of our publication of our intentions, upon many others of our Congregations, who have been kept off, upon their own acknowledgedment, by fears of their own unfitneſs, without the leaſt ſcruple at the Diſcipline, and have by ſcores at a Sacrament come in ſince that time in ſome of our places, and we hope to their own and the Congregations comfort. And for our parts we do not thinke the ground ſufficient, that any of their perſwaſion ſtands out upon, to excuſe the neglect of this Ordinance. And we muſt take leave to tell them, that we have viſited ſome on their death beds, that have ſtood out on their grounds, that have been much troubled at their neglect herein; and if they had recovered, have profeſſed their reſolution to have joyned as not finding this pretence of ſcruple at the government, a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering wide enough for the ſin of neglect of ſuch a duty; we would wiſh men would pretend nothing, but what will beare weight on their death bed. We believe, thoughts of death would tame the height of ſome mens ſpirits, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they would finde reaſon to ſubmit to the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, or at leaſt to carry more peaceably towards it, then they do. We cannot but look on it as a ſad thing, that ſo many are ſo indifferent; that carry the names of Chriſtians, yet care not to be in an incapacity of partaking in the Supper. If they make it a light matter, we do not; and if Chriſt ſend us to the high <hi>waies and hedges</hi> to fetch in his gueſts, we will not refuſe the ſervice, nor be aſhamed to beare the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of more then that phraſe ſignifies, for his ſake.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And what though we were to exhort perſons to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply themſelves to the Elderſhip, for their coming to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; doth this follow, that all that can not ſubmit to El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, ſhall be ſubject to excommunication, whether ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous or no? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We preſume, if they had their Government on foot, whatſoever they would allow to diſſenting Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren (which when time was, was little enough, as ſome of us well remember) yet they would not betray their Diſcipline to contempt, by making it indifferent, whether the people
<pb facs="tcp:119100:27"/>
render any ſubmiſſion to it, or no. If men have no ſcruples againſt the Government practiſed, who is ſo little a friend to peace, or ſatisfied in the grounds of his own actings, as to caſt needleſs ſcruples before them? It was time enough for us to manifeſt, what we could condeſcend to, in reſpect of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of admiſſion, when there was occaſion offered for any ſuch need, which we have not ordinarily met with, in thoſe that have ſince tendred themſelves to the Ordinance. There was enough declared at the Publication of the Paper, to have prevented any ſuch conſtruction, as they made of it in this thing; and therefore we cannot but admire at what we finde next, that our aime ſhould be <hi>to bring all ſorts to ſubject them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to Miniſters and Elders for examination; and that all perſons muſt come under the inquiſition, not ſo much to fit them for the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, as to teach them Obedience, that they might know themſelves to be homines ad ſervitutem nati,</hi> &amp;c. whenas the chief Acter in the Printing of theſe Papers, could not but heare a ſolemne profeſſion to the contrary at our publiſhing of our Paper as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid; which he cannot ſhew to be contradicted by any af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter practice; as alſo when by experience there are ſeverall Communicants in our Congregations, that have ſcrupled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing examined before the Elders, whom yet we have not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, but have found out expedients for their admiſſion, without any further trouble to them in the thing they have ſcrupled; the Elderſhip conſenting, that two Miniſters might take an account of their knowledg, and they after be admitted by the Elderſhip, and of this practice of ours, both before and ſince upon occaſion, there are ſeverall in our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations able, and we believe, ready to teſtifie.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Whether our Paper publiſhed, for the ſcope or mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, deſerve to be called <hi>brutum fulmen,</hi> or whether their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer ſavoured of all, or any <hi>meekneſſe and humility,</hi> we ſhall not here ſpeake further of; they beſt know, with what frame of ſpirit they tendred it, though we could diſcerne but little of ſuch a temper in it. For the grounds of their diſſatisfaction but in one ſheet; and that we put our ſelves to the trouble of ſeaven <hi>to returne them an Anſwer in,</hi> and whether it be <hi>longer

then ſound,</hi> we leave the Papers themſelves to manifeſt of which (being publiſhed by them) the Reader may ſupply himſelf with an account, and freely making his own judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p n="6">6. For what <hi>Eccleſiaſticall</hi> or <hi>Civill Sanction</hi> we have for our Government, we leave that to be judged by thoſe, that ſhall peruſe our following Papers. And that they wonder that men <hi>pretending to Religion and Learning,</hi> &amp;c. So we wonder at them, how they dare pretend to <hi>Religion or Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and call them mens own Lawes, the Placita of our own wills, fancies of men,</hi> nay, <hi>praevarications;</hi> before they had better made it to appear, that they were ſuch. That mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is foule indeed, and inconſiſtent with Religion and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>to call in the God of truth to abett our own fancies, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to civill authority to ſecond our own prevarications.</hi> But we might return to the Laconicke <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>If</hi> to this, <hi>If it be ſo;</hi> but that's the great Queſtion. But the Prefator here can diſpute and moderate too, and very ingenuouſly determine on his own ſide, without any reſpect at all to our Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the contrary, <hi>eg regiae ſcilieet artis eſt ridere, quod non poteſt ſolvere.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>What unguided zeale or intereſt it is,</hi> that ſhould <hi>precipitate</hi> us, we no more are carefull to clear our ſelves from, then to retort the like upon them in their oppoſition of us, which we might as well do. But about this danger of a <hi>Premunire,</hi> we cannot thinke them cordiall in their advice and caution to us, becauſe they would perſwade us to return to <hi>Canonicall obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and Epiſcopacy,</hi> &amp;c. which we know is expreſly excepted againſt in the late Laws of the Land, and we foreſee it to be a <hi>Praemunire</hi> to meddle with them; and therefore we have cauſe to judg, that they would fancy us in a <hi>Premunire</hi> in the way a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, not careing to draw us into a reall <hi>Praemunire</hi> in a way with them.</p>
               <p n="8">8. That what we publiſhed is any thing againſt the Laws, it will ſpeake for it ſelf; they have publiſhed it to the view of the world, and if, without their Comment, any thing be juſtly culpable by the Law, we are not now likely to be concealed.</p>
               <p n="9">
                  <pb facs="tcp:119100:28"/>
9. But that what we publiſhed ſhould be ſtiled <hi>Laws and Canons, and that for all men to obey upon paine of excommunication,</hi> we ſee no reaſon for any ſuch conſtruction of our action. We preſume our concluſions ſhould not have been ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Canons</hi> by them, unleſs thereby they intended to put ſome odium upon them. And they know whoſe practice in Government made that word leſs pleaſing amongſt us, which was well received and reverenced in the ancient Church, to ſet forth the concluſions of Councils and Synods by.</p>
               <p n="10">10. They now to the end of their Preface, expreſs their trouble at our ſelf-contradiction in ſeverall things; as firſt, that we ſhould cry out againſt the Prelates for Lordlineſs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Gods <hi>inheritance,</hi> and we our ſelves aſpire at the ſame and much more. If they find not our way <hi>more ſociall,</hi> we are ſure, they have felt as little of the <hi>burthen of our fingers.</hi> If the Prelates had bent their endeavours and authority to informe the groſly ignorant, and to reforme the openly ſcandalous, it had never by us been cryed out againſt for Lordly Tyranny. And when we have principally in this cauſe ſo bent our ſelves, we wonder with what face they can fancy us Prelaticall: we ſhould never have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of the <hi>weight of their loynes,</hi> if it had been only in theſe caſes; and if in theſe manifeſt entruſtments of Chriſts Government, <hi>viz.</hi> For the information of the ignorant, and reformation of the ſcandalous, our fingers are heavier then their loines, they ſay more to ours, and leſs to the Prelates honour. The Prelates Lording it over the Lords heritage, we frequently declare wherein it was, when we ſpeake of it; and not as they charge us with the ſame, and tell us not for what. When we enjoyne Ceremonies, bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Name of Jeſus, Croſſe in Baptiſme, wearing the Surplice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by any authority in our Government, they bring in ſomething Prelaticall to our charge, but not when we only preſs to the utmoſt againſt ignorance and ſcandall, which was the leaſt thing, that Government was ordinarily known by. We take the Parochiall Dioceſan
<pb facs="tcp:119100:28"/>
as a meere ſcoffe, the very Officer they ſtrive againſt in our Congregations make it apparent, how farre our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is from a Parochiall Prelacy. If they would be underſtood, beſides this flouriſh, to meane our inforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our way upon men of other perſwaſions, we have manifeſted by what we have ſaid before, and by our frequent practice, how unjuſt this charge is.</p>
               <p n="13">13. The ſecond thing is, That we contradict our ſelves to inveigh againſt the Donatiſts and Schiſmaticks; and yet eſpouſe their quarrels. And here by the by, the great Diana of this Party is brought in, <hi>viz.</hi> mixt Communion. A fearfull errour we are guilty of in oppoſing this, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That this was the great errour of the Donatiſts the world muſt believe; and yet we Preach againſt them, and this great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly troubles theſe Gentlemen. We have contended againſt the Donatiſts of our times, that pretend to ſeparate from true Churches, as many have done, and we underſtand not that S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ever ſtrove againſt <hi>Donatus,</hi> or his followers in any other ſenſe. But that prophane and ſcandalous perſons ſhould not be debarred the Sacrament, ſure is a thing, men ſo much for antiquity and the Church of <hi>England,</hi> ſhould never take as Donatiſme. The ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration which we make, is no other then what <hi>Chryſoſtome, Cyprian,</hi> and <hi>Auguſtine</hi> himſelfe, will appeare by their writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to have led us in; and what our Church of <hi>England</hi> in the Rubrick of the Common Prayer, did enjoyn and ſhould have practiſed.</p>
               <p n="14">14. We know not any ſecular power we ever exerciſed, or deſired to do, over any, which any Parliament or his late Highneſs <hi>hath blunted the edge of.</hi> If they meane the civill Sanction for our Government, we conſtantly deny, that either the Parliament or his late Highneſs hath done any ſuch thing, as by our Papers may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare.</p>
               <p n="15">15. And for the hurt they ſpeake of by our ſecular power, or by the <hi>Goliah</hi>'s Sword, they jeere to have taken up,
<pb facs="tcp:119100:29"/>
they might do well to conſider that of <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 3. Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall as well as civill Rulers, are <hi>not a terrour to good workes, but to evill, wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou ſhalt have praiſe of the ſame.</hi> For our requiring a <hi>Sibboleth</hi> for admiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it is none other then a blameleſſe life and compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent knowledge, and this, we are able to ſhew it, one of the chief of theſe Subſcribers hath conſented to under his hand in his own caſe; we hope they will none of them own it, that they have not this <hi>Shibbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth</hi> ready. And for our <hi>requiring all Men to fall down and worſhip the Idoll we have ſet up;</hi> we might as well call their endeavouring to ſet up Epiſcopacy, to be the fond attempt of rearing of Dagon to his place again, when he fallen and broken before the Arke of God. It is a ſmall matter to make us like the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> when a little before as bad as <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar:</hi> For the Taskmaſters dilemma we urge them with; ſure it wight have ſufficed what was ſaid in our Anſwer, which they have Printed, to have cleared out Text from that gloſſe they put upon it; that the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of excommunication was to be underſtood in caſe of ſcandall and obſtinacy only; If the firſt conſtruction would not have born it (which that it would and doth, we muſt, with men that ſtand upon nicities, endeavour to prove) yet they having our expreſs meaning declared, vve vvonder how yet to faſten an aſperſion upon us, they dare in this place take the thing for granted in their own ſenſe: We deſire to put men in no other ſtraits, then God himſelfe declares them to be in, and yet hath left a ſufficient way-out: Men that are ſcandalous ſinne if they come to the Sacrament, and ſinne if they come not, in the one for a miſſion of known duty, in the other, for an undue and ſinfull performance of it, men <hi>may eate and drinke unworthily,</hi> and abſtaine from eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and drinking unworthily too, but they are under a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of mending, that they may both come and come worthily.</p>

                  <pb facs="tcp:119100:29"/>
16. For the third contradiction they are grieved with, it is, that men that <hi>impropriate the name of Saints,</hi> &amp;c. ſhould not carry more tenderly then we do; truly to this we may Anſwer, that they may charge that on us in malice, which we cannot make it our buſineſs to vindicate our ſelves from with modeſty; we know nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther when we impropriated the names of Saints, or Chriſtians to our ſelves; nor yet wherein, in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular they mention, we have walked contrary; we preſume the thing they charge us with, they acquit themſelves from; we will go no further for appeale, then the Papers in hand; let the impartiall Reader view, what he can find ſavouring of ſo much ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and candor in their firſt and laſt Papers, and what there is of provocation in ours, and by that let the matter be judged (wherever the profeſſion of Saintſhip is) where the contrary practice is moſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent. We thinke it not ſtrange to be counted le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall and bitter for ſpeaking againſt ſinne, when the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle was counted an enemy <hi>for telling the truth.</hi> It is ſadly ſuſpiſcious the controverſie lies on another prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, then yet is in view. We know not any thing we are guilty of, like cenſoriouſneſſe; unleſs it be free ſpeaking upon all occaſions againſt groſs wickedneſſe; we would hope thoſe men would not patronize that cauſe, which we profeſs our ſelves only againſt. If this be it, that makes us ſo cenſorious in private, and ſevere in publique, we muſt profeſs, we dare not be Miniſters, to ſooth up men in their ſinnes, unleſs they can finde us a Chriſt, that will ſave them in their ſinnes; yet we hope that ſuch of our people, as have had occaſion to be converſant with us even in this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe of the Sacrament, do finde ſome of that Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell tenderneſſe, which theſe men would perſwade the world we are ſo utterly deſtitute of, and will Anſwer more for us herein, then we thinke fit to ſay for our ſelves.</p>

17. They now conclude their Preface, which uſhers theſe Papers into the world, and declare how much they were forced againſt their diſpoſitions to Print; we hope they will not ſay, we forced them, for they know we knew nothing of it. They proteſt it is <hi>ſine ullo ſtudio contentionis, without any pleaſure, or delight in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention;</hi> whenas they were upon tearmes of accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation with us, according to our Narrative and the truth, and yet Print the Papers; and they profeſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hereby fire their Beacons, to raiſe up others to the like oppoſition, or a ſtronger, where there is ability and occaſion. For the ſucceſs of their cauſe, we know not what God in his wiſe judgement may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it to be; the reception of what they have done, or we may now do amongſt men, we know not; but <hi>pro captu lectoris,</hi> &amp;c. we are well aware of a ſpirit of prophaneneſſe and indifferency in the things of God that prevailes ſadly in this Nation: and with men of looſe lives, it is enough that ſome have ſpoken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Government, <hi>quale quale ſit,</hi> vvhatever it is they ſay, and vvhatever vve may ſay to the contrary in our Anſwer, theirs ſhall go for an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerable Piece, (becauſe it is of a Subject ſo deare to too many) though ours to the contrary be never read by them. For thoſe that are ſober and moderate, we queſtion not but they have ſeen ſomething in ours already, that is in a good part unanſwered, and much vvronged in theirs, vvhich vvould in ſome meaſure ſatisfie them, if vve ſhould have ſaid no more; however ſtay their appetites till this our further Anſwer comes.</p>
               <p>¶ It may not ſeem altogether impertinent to the ſober and unprejudiced Reader, if in this place vve ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyne, only a briefe Note in vvay of vindication, of the ſame ſo much oppoſed, and deſpiſed Presbyterian Government, from an injury (as vve conceive) offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to it by another hand. And though vve reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb facs="tcp:119100:30"/>
the Learned Author of the Book vvherein it is done, <hi>viz.</hi> Dr. <hi>Sanderſon,</hi> a man eminent for his Learning and labours in the Church of God; yet vve conceive the vvorthy Doctor vvill hold us excuſed, if we take notice of the vvrong he hath done us, ſince he hath (as vve judge) cauſeleſly aſperſed us in Print. And we rather ſhall do this little in this place (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining our ſelves to what (as vve judge) doth more particularly concern us) that we may hereby invite ſome worthy Author, that may have time, and a more convenient occaſion of doing it more largely, to take up ſome other paſſages in the ſame Book; vvhich we thinke might eaſily be cleared, and the Doctors want of moderation (vvhich yet he ſo much profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth) be much evidenced in thoſe many charges he caſts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Presbyterians, his <hi>Anticeremoniall Brethren.</hi> But this paſſage is in his Preface to his fourteen Sermons Printed <hi>Ano.</hi> 1657. In his eighteenth Paragraph, vvhere he vvould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the world much, that the Presbyterians (though not <hi>purpoſely,</hi> yet) <hi>eventually,</hi> ſhould be the great promoters <hi>of the Roman intereſt amongſt us, and that more waies then one;</hi> as by putting to their hands to pull down Epiſcopacy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his ſecond thing he ſaies, they promote the <hi>Roman</hi> intereſt, <hi>by oppoſing it with more violence then reaſon,</hi> &amp;c. And ſo, as the common fault of all Presbyterians ſo to do (they being men it ſeems not dealing with learning and reaſon in the Doctor's eſteem) he confirms this by an obſervation of ſome, (vvhich he makes moſt his own, in that he only publiſheth it to the world and ſubſcribes unto it) vvith a particular reference to our County, in theſe vvords: <hi>It hath been obſerved by ſome (and I know no reaſon to queſtion the truth of the obſervation) that in thoſe Counties</hi> (Lancaſhire <hi>for one) where there are the moſt, and the moſt rigid Presbyterians, there are alſo the moſt, and the moſt zealous Roman Catholicks.</hi> To vvhich vve ſay, that though vve ſhall not ſtand upon vvhat he aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that either <hi>there are moſt, or moſt rigid Presbyterians in this County,</hi> the truth of which, in any ſenſe, but vvhat is truly
<pb facs="tcp:119100:31"/>
an honour to us, in vvhich vve thinke he vvould be very ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, vve might queſtion; as alſo vvhat he meanes by Papiſts, and thoſe <hi>moſt, and moſt zealous;</hi> and that in this County they ſhould be ſuch, vve ſhall not now diſpute; but that Presbytery ſhould be the <hi>eventuall cauſe</hi> of this, vve do much admite at the Doctors Aſlertion. For if it vvere ſo, that vvhere rigid Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians are, there ſhould be rigid Papiſts; doth it therefore follow that the one is the cauſe of the other? We ſhould to ſuch a conſequence return the Anſwer, which Bp. <hi>La<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>imer</hi> made to the Objection againſt Preaching, that Preaching vvas the cauſe of Rebellion; for before Preaching was, there vvas not ſuch Rebellion; vvhich vvas, that this vvas, <hi>as Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derton ſteeple was the cauſe of the ſtoppage of Sandwich haven;</hi> but that vve judge the conſequents of the Doctors obſervation more abſurd. For it doth not ſo vvell follow, that Presbytery ſhould occaſion ſtifneſs in Popery, becauſe it cannot be ſaid of the Papiſts in this County, that they vvere not here, before Presbytery came in. If this be the eventuall cauſe vvhat vvas it then, before this Government vvas eſtabliſhed, that vvas the cauſe, there vvas ſo many rigid Papiſts in <hi>Lancaſhire?</hi> If their very riſe and breeding had been contemporary with this Government, there had b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>en more reaſon for the obſervation, (though not much in it at the beſt) but that the prevalency of a more ridgid Popery in this County, which was ſo evident in the time of Epiſcopacy, as is notorious to all that are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with theſe parts, that this ſhould be aſcribed to Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery ſo long before it was born here, we admire at the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of this learned man herein. But its ordinary vvith many men of this way (and we are ſorry to ſee any of this ſpirit in ſo Reverend a man) that what is found amiſs amongſt us, which was truly the fault of the Prelaticall Clergy, or at leaſt much more theirs, is ordinarily laid upon the Presbyteriall Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, for but coming in their places after them. We deſire to be ſenſible of what is amiſs in our Congregations, and to take to, what we can be truly charged with, in defect of not endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to reforme, as we could deſire: yet we thinke it ſtrange to be reproached for theſe things by the Epiſcopall
<pb facs="tcp:119100:31"/>
men, who led us the vvay (vve may ſpeak vvithout partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) in greater neglects, in reſpect of their ordinary perſonall care of their places, and laid the foundation of thoſe abuſes in our members by their negligence, which we are yet lit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>le a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to remove. And for men of this perſwaſion to come and view our Congregations and Counties, and to find theſe faults, to reflect upon this Government thereby, we think it ill chid of them of any. This holds true in this of the Doctors, as of our Gentlemen in their charge of our peoples ignorance to be for want of catechizing and the like. We ſhall not ſay much about the number of Papiſts at preſent in this County, but this we are confident, they have gotten no ground upon us ſince Presbytery was ſetled here. The furtheſt part of the County hath many in it, as it had ever ſince Queens <hi>Mari's</hi> time, the reformation never yet prevailing in thoſe parts, eſpecially for want of a ſetled Miniſtery there; and where moſt Papiſts are, there the Government is leaſt ſetled, ſo that if we were directly chargeable with this thing, it might the more truly be ſaid to thoſe that know this countrey, the want of Church Government ſhould rather be the eventuall cauſe of Popery to them. And whether it may not be trulier ſaid, that Popery gets more advantage from the want of Government in the Church, then from the Presbyterian Government, which was never ſo effectually ſetled, we leave all unprejudic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed perſons to judg: and if eventuall cauſes be talkt of, whether ſeverall of the Epiſcopall men, that bend their ſtrength ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Presbytery, and whilſt they contend for a Government excepted againſt, thereby endeavouring anarchy in the Church, do not herein gratifie the Papiſts, time will ſhew. We might further ſay, that in theſe parts we have had none (that we know of) revolted to Popery ſince Presbytery was ſetled. And for ſome we know very eminent, that turned Papiſts in the height of Prelacy, and upon ſome offences and ſad acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents that befell ſome in the Clergy then, which we forbeare particularly to inſtance; and they do but continue under us as they were before: ſo that Epiſcopacy ſure was the <hi>eventuall cauſe</hi> of their apoſtacy, by the Argument of this obſervation

of the Doctors. May we add an obſervation of a worthy Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, which we have heard from him, and let it ſtand by this of the Doctors, and for the truth of it abide the teſt and ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt examination, and it may be ſtill in purſuance of this vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of our Government. It was this, that of the three formes in Church Government that are ſpoken of amongſt us, <hi>(viz.</hi> Presbytery, Epiſcopacy, and Independency) of all three, the firſt where it hath prevailed, hath been followed with leaſt errors in Doctrine. For Epiſcopacy, it is well known, how many of the Divines under that Government were infected with Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minianiſm, Socinianiſm, and Popery it ſelf.

               <p>IN purſuance of an Order of the laſt Provincial, the firſt Claſſe doth humbly repreſent to this Aſſembly, their apprehenſions in the caſe to them propounded, in a draught prepared for the ſeveral Congregations belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to their own Aſſociation, if it ſhall be approved of by this Aſſembly, and which they do wholely ſubmit to their Judgements.</p>
               <p>It being repreſented to this Claſſe, and much complained of, and offence being taken, That in the ſeveral Congregations, (if not in all) belonging to this Aſſociation, there are many perſons of all ſorts, that are members of Congregations, and publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enjoy ſeverall priviledges; as, hearing of the Word, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Church, and baptizing of their children, and ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for injuries done unto them, That yet live in a total and ſinfull neglect of the Lords Supper, that are ſcandalous and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive in their lives, drunkards, unclean perſons, ſwearers, Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> breakers, neglecters of Family-duties, that will not ſubject themſelves to the preſent government of the Church, but live as lawleſs perſons out of their rank and order, &amp; that there are ſundry that are groſly ignorant in the main points of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion; Theſe are to give notice, that this Claſſe, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:119100:34"/>
theſe things to heart, and much grieved for them, do pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh and make known;</p>
               <p n="1">1. That every Miniſter belonging to this Aſſociation, ſhall ſet apa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t one or two, or more of the weeke dayes, in every month, for the catechizing of the ſeveral familyes belonging to their reſpective Congregations; and for the information of the ignorant in thoſe families, and that the families to be catechized on each of ſuch dayes, ſet apart for that purpoſe, have notice the Lords day before, to meet the Miniſter either at the Church, or Chappel, or the Miniſters houſe, or ſome other houſe within the Congregation, that may be convenient for the neighboring families to meet at, that ſhal be appointed for ſuch a day, as may be judged meeteſt by the ſeverall Miniſters.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That notice ſhall be taken of all perſons that forſake the publick Aſſemblies of the Saints, and conſtantly turn their backs of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That like notice ſhall be taken of all ſcandalous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That they ſhall be privately admoniſhed, according to the order preſcribed by Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. once or twice, to ſee if they will reforme, and that the Miniſter, when he catechizeth the ſeveral families, ſhall exhort ſuch perſons in them, as he finds to be of competent knowledge, and are blameleſſe in life, that they preſent themſelves to the Elderſhip, that they may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Lords Supper.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That if they will neither hearken to private admonition, nor the admonition of the Elderſhip, their names ſhall be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed openly in the ſeverall Congregations, and they warned before all to reforme.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That if after all this they ſhall continue obſtinate, they ſhall be caſt out and excommunicated.</p>
               <p>Theſe things this Claſſe thought fit to give publick notice of, being very ſenſible, that, for the want of the vigorous exerciſe of Church diſcipline, ignorance, Atheiſm, and licentiouſneſſe growes upon us, to the great diſhonour of God, ſcandall of Religion, hazzard and undoing of many precious ſouls, and the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:119100:34"/>
laying a blot on our ſeverall Congregations; and therefore they are now reſolved (ſeeing themſelves neceſſitated, to this ſeverity of diſcipline, for the freeing themſelves from the great guilt of neglect of their own duty, that otherwiſe they ſhal be under) to make uſe of that power that Chriſt hath committed to them, for edification, and not for deſtruction; although it would be their far greater joy, that there might not be occaſion of uſing ſharpneſſe; and therefore they doe earneſtly in the bowels of Jeſus Chriſt beſeech all thoſe that are ignorant, that they would apply themſelves diligently to the uſe of all publick and private means for their information, ſubmitting themſelves with all readineſſe to be inſtructed, and to conſider, that without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the minde cannot be good: and they do alſo in the name of Jeſus Chriſt, exhort and warn all ſuch as live ſcandalouſly, and in the practice of open ſins, that they breake off their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities by repentance, and turn unto God ſpeedily with their whole heart, that they neither incur the cenſure of being caſt out of the Church here, nor by continuing in their ſinfull courſe be kept from ever entering into the kingdome of Heaven here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p>And as touching ſuch as turne their backs conſtantly on the Lords Supper, this Claſſe doth wiſh them in ſeriouſnes to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, what an account they will be able one day to give unto Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, for their living in the dayly neglect of an ordinance that is ſo exceeding neceſſary for their own comfort and growth in grace; and that they would lay aſide all prejudice, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is that hinders, and ſubmit themſelves unto wholeſom or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for their own good, as this Claſſe hath been ready on their part, to expreſſe all tenderneſſe toward the weak, and a willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to condeſcend to the meaneſt, for the removing all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of ſtumbling, ſo far as lies in their power. And yet, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the fearfull danger that all ſuch do lay themſelves open unto, that ſhall eat and drink the Body and Blood of the Lord unworthily, they do warn whoſoever comes to the Lords Table, to take ſpecial care ſo often as they come to examin themſelves, leſt they eat and drink their own damnation.</p>
               <p>But becauſe the exerciſe of Church diſcipline muſt begin at private perſons, and that if they neglect their duty of watching
<pb facs="tcp:119100:35"/>
over, and admoniſhing one another, and bringing complaints to the Elderſhip as there is occaſion, little or nothing can be done for the thorow reformation of the ſeveral Congregations; this Claſſe doth therefore warne all and every of the Members be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing unto them, to conſider the great guilt they will lye un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if they through their neglect, obſtruct ſo neceſſary a work, and doth exhort that therefore they would in all faithfulneſſe, laying aſide all partiality, ſlaviſhneſſe and ſelf-reſpects, addreſſe themſelves to the diſcharge of their duty, that if any walk diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly, and will not be reclaimed by private admonition, they making complaint thereof to the Elderſhip, courſe may be taken for excommunicating of the obſtinate, and thereby purging out the old leaven, to the glory of God, the delivering their own ſouls from that guilt they will otherwiſe lye under, the preſerving the Ordinances from prophanation, and the reſt of the lump from being leavened, the ſtopping of the mouths of ſuch as ſeek occaſion againſt us, and finally the everlaſting wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare and ſalvation of the ſouls of thoſe that go aſtray.</p>

               <p>WE have ſeene and ſeriouſly weighed that paper draught, Intituled <hi>A preſentation of the firſt Claſſe at</hi> Mancheſter, <hi>dated the</hi> 8. <hi>of Sept.</hi> 1657. confirmed by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinciall Aſſembly at <hi>Preſton, Octob.</hi> 6. and publiſhed at <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter</hi> Church the 22. of <hi>Nov.</hi> in the aforeſaid yeare: and do publiſh this our ſenſe, and Apprehenſion of it, as far as is plain to us, not reſting in the Judgement and determination of any Generall Councill contrary thereunto (if any ſuch ſhould be) much leſs to one of your Provincial Aſſemblies; Though you ſeem to ſubmit to your Provincial, what you will hardly grant to a General Council: In which we diſſent from you; Though in other things we ſhall joyn, as firſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We joyn with you, in a deep ſence of the ſeverall groſſe ſins and errors of the times, deſiring earneſtly to mourn, firſt for our own, next for the ſins of others of our Chriſtian Brethren, and fellow members of that Church, whereof Chriſt is the Head: We are grieved together with you, for the Scandalous and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive lives of ſuch as live in drunkeneſſe, uncleaneſſe, ſwearing, prophanation of the Sabbath, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. We are alſo ſenſible with you, that there are ſundry perſons, groſſely ignorant in the main points of Chriſtian Religion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. You with us again (we hope) are ſenſible and grieved (though you do not at all mention them) for the groſſe errours
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:119100:36"/>
in judgement, and the damnable Doctrine of many, who have rent themſelves into as many ſeverall hereſies, as they have into Sects and Schiſmes.</p>
               <p>Thus far we agree, nay more, touching the way of informing the ignorant, and reforming the wicked and erroneous, we ſhall not much diſſent.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>And firſt for the information and inſtruction of the ignorant, by way of Catechizing, before they be admitted to the Sacrament;</hi> The courſe by you publiſhed (provided it be in publique) little differeth from the order preſcribed by the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and other reformed Churches abroad, before any be admitted to the Sacrament of the Lords Supper.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>For thoſe who erre ſo groſſely, whether in Doctrinals, or points of diſciplin, thereby renting from a true conſtituted Church:</hi> Though you ſpeak nothing either of their ſin or puniſhment, yet we hope, you with us do hold, That the Churches lawful Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, have the power of the Keyes committed to them, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate ſuch offenders.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>For ſuch as are ſcandalous and wicked in their lives;</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, private and publique, is to be obſerved according to Chriſts rule, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18 but if they ſtill continue and will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, the Churches lawfull Paſtors have power to excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate ſuch.</p>
               <p>Thus far we accord in judgement, touching the way of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the ignorant, and reforming wicked perſons, and ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall; which courſe is ſo fully warranted by the Word of God, and the conſtant practice of the Catholique Church; that we are not ſo wavering, and unſetled in our apprehenſions of the caſe, as to ſubmit either it or them, either wholly or in part, to the contrary judgement and determination of a Generall Council of the Eaſtern or Weſtern Churches, much leſſe, to a new termed Provincial Aſſembly at <hi>Preſton,</hi> wherein we not lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle differ from you.</p>
               <p>Other parts of your Paper are full of darkneſſe, to which we cannot ſo fully aſſent, till further explicated and unfolded by you. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whereas you ſay, <hi>That in the ſeveral congregations (if not in all) belonging to this Aſſociation, there are many perſons of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:119100:36"/>
all ſorts that are members of Congregations,</hi> &amp;c. you ſeeme to hint, that though your grief may be general (as ours) for all offenders, yet your cenſures extend onely to thoſe who have admitted themſelves members of ſome Congregation within your Aſſociation, and yet live inordinately, and will not be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed: If ſo, then we who never were any members or aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates of yours, are not within the verge and compaſſe of your Presbyterian diſcipline; for what have you to do to judge thoſe that are without?</p>
               <p n="2">2. But whereas your complaint, and offence taken, is, <hi>That many there are of all ſorts, who will not ſubmit themſelves to the preſent Government of the Church, but live like lawleſs perſons out of their rank and order.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If by the preſent Government of the Church, you mean your own (as may ſtrongly be conjectured you do) then are we alſo comprehended therein, and muſt fall within your cenſure, and not onely we, but all Papiſts, Anabaptiſts, and all other, of what Profeſſion; and Religion ſoever, who live within the Pariſh, muſt be taken for members of ſome one Congregation within your Aſſociation, and ſo driven into the common fold of Presbytery, and be ſubject to your Government: And this (as we ſuppoſe) is the chief deſign of you, in this, as in other tranſactions of yours, to ſubject all to your Government, which you garniſh over with the ſpecious title, of <hi>Chriſts Government, Throne,</hi> and <hi>Scepter.</hi> Presbytery is the main thing driven at here; and however ſhe cometh uſhered in with a Godly pretence of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, for the ſins and ignorance of the times, and a duty incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent upon you, to exerciſe the power which Chriſt hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to you, for edification, and not for deſtruction; yet theſe are but as ſo many waſte papers wherein Presbytery is wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, to make it look more handſomly, and paſs more currently; but beware we muſt, for <hi>latet anguis in Herbâ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But you ſay, <hi>For want of the vigorous exerciſe of this Eccleſiaſtical diſcipline, ignorance, Atheiſm, and Licentiouſneſs growes upon us, and men live as lawleſſe perſons, out of their rank and order, becauſe not ſubject to your preſent Governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>

               <p>

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:119100:37"/>
throughout his Highneſs Dominions, as is conſonant to the will of God; and Univerſall practice of primitive Churches, that Eccleſiaſticall diſcipline may be exerciſed, in the hands of them, to whom it was committed by Chriſt, and left by him, to be transferred from hand to hand to the end of the World; and ſhall readily joyn with you in humble addreſſes, to his Highnes, and his great Council, for the eſtabliſhment of ſuch a Church Government.</p>
               <p>In the mean time though there may be ſuch, who (as you ſay) live as lawleſs perſons, out of their rank and order, yet are they ſubject to law, and therefore ſubject to puniſhment, for though your Eccleſiaſtical ſword cannot take hold on them, the civill ſword doth reach them.</p>
               <p>Your Claſs may do well then not to contemn (as in charity we hope you do not) the authority of the civill Magiſtrate, but in ſtead of warning all and every member belonging to them, to complain to the Elderſhip, of thoſe that walke diſorderly, and will not be reclaimed, to the end they may excommunicate them, That they exhort them to complaine to the civill Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, whoſe ſword of Juſtice is ſharper and longer, and likely to work a greater reformation in the lives, and manners of men, by a corporal and pecuniary Mulct, then any ſword of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication or other Church cenſure your Elderſhip can any way pretend unto;</p>
               <p>There are other parts of your paper do remain likewiſe dark, which we deſire may be made plain unto us; for whereas you ſay,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There are many perſons of all ſorts,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That will not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelves to the preſent Government of the Church, but live as lawleſs perſons, out of their rank and order.</hi> Our Quaeres there upon are;</p>
               <p n="1">1. Why Government <hi>in ſingulari?</hi> is there no Eccleſiaſticall Government but yours? may not another Church have its Government different from yours, yet not different from that which Chriſt hath preſcribed in his Word? <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith, yea; <hi>Scimus enim, unicuique Eccleſiae</hi> &amp;c. And accordingly there are other Churches in <hi>England</hi> different in Government from yours, and as good as yours.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:119100:37"/>
But if you ſay yours is the Government, (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) by way of eminency, as Chriſts own Government more immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and <hi>jure divino,</hi> which you ſo much defend, then why (the preſent) is there no preſent Government in any Church or Aſſembly of Saints, but where your diſcipline is erected? Are all the reſt at preſent without Government? or where hath yours been this 1500. years paſt till this preſent? Hath <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtianiſm</hi> ſo overſpread the face of the Church that Chriſts own Goverment could never get footing till this preſent? But now ſubjection is required thereto of all, yet many of all ſorts will not ſubject, but live as lawleſs perſons, out of their rank and order.</p>
               <p>Our next Quaere is;</p>
               <p>What? muſt all thoſe that obſerve not your ranks and orders, ſubject not themſelves to your preſent Government, be taken for lawleſs perſons, out of their rank and order? Yea; for ſo this cloſe connexion of yours ſeems to import, <hi>(viz.) many who do not ſubject but live,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In your paper you further proceed, and make it an order, <hi>That notice ſhall be taken of all perſons, that forſake the publick aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of Saints.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We would gladly know how far you extend this Saintſhip. this Church and aſſembly of Saints, if to your own Church one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſuch as ſubject themſelves to your Government; then S. <hi>Auguſtines</hi> Anſwer againſt the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> who would not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge a Church in the World but amongſt themſelves, may alſo be yours, <hi>O Impudentem Vocem!</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Illa non eſt, Quia tu in illa non es: Vide ne tu ideo non ſis, nam illa erit etſi tu non ſis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if your charity reach further then to your own aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, then you make lawleſs perſons, ſuch as will not ſubject themſelves to your Government, Saints, and members at leaſt of the inviſible Triumphant Church, though none of your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent viſible militant Church; and then your charity over-reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
               <p>Again, we are unſatisfied in the Word <hi>(Publique) the publique aſſemblies of the Saints,</hi> What? do not private aſſemblies pleaſe
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:119100:38"/>
you? We preſume you are not againſt private meetings, your own practice ſpeaks the contrary: But you will bind all (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding your private Aſſemblies) to frequent your pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique alſo, other wayes they ſhall be taken notice of: What? though they cannot ſubmit to your Government? Leave you no room for tender conſciences? The Laws of the Land have otherwayes provided: And if you, under colour of authority, will make Laws and Edicts, and publiſh them openly in the Church, for all to obey, upon pain of excommunication, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Laws in force, whether you do it in contempt of the civil power, or through ignorance of the Laws; which later is rather to be ſuppoſed, in a charitable and favourable conſtruction, yet in what ſenſe ſoever it be taken, we much que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, and it concerns you to look to it, whether you have not run your ſelves into a <hi>praemunire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, whereas you ſay, <hi>That like notice ſhall be taken of all ſcandalous perſons.</hi> Our next Quaere is; Whether thoſe that forſake the publique Aſſemblies of Saints in the ſecond order, may not be taken for ſcandalous, and ſo comprehended in this third. If ſo, <hi>Quare oneramini ritibus?</hi> why do you lengthen out your paper, and burden us with traditions, in multiplying of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders <hi>ſine neceſſitate ad Arthritim uſque?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After the ſecond and third orders againſt thoſe that forſake the publique Aſſemblies of Saints, and ſuch as are ſcandalous, comes in a fourth, touching the <hi>Catechumenists</hi> in the firſt order mentioned; <hi>(viz.) That the Miniſter when he Cateobizeth the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Families, ſhall exhort ſuch perſons in them as he finds, be of compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent knowledge, and are blameleſſe in life, that they preſent themſelves to the Elderſhip, that they may be admitted to the Sacrament of the Lords Supper?</hi> But what if they will not preſent themſelves before the Elderſhip? <hi>The Miniſter muſt exhort and admoniſh them.</hi> What if ſtill they refuſe? <hi>Their names ſhall be publiſhed openly in the ſeveral congregations, and they warned before all to reform.</hi> That's the fifth order. Mark! Men of blameleſſe life and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge muſt be warned before all to reform.</p>
               <p>But what if after all this they will not reform, but continue obſtinate! <hi>Then no admiſſion to the Sacrament;</hi> that's implyed in the fourth order; There's their <hi>Excommunicatio minor:</hi>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:119100:38"/>
But that's not all, a higher cenſure yet; <hi>They ſhall be caſt out, and excommunicated;</hi> So faith the ſixth and laſt order, the great Excommunication, which caſteth out of the Church alſo, and judgeth them no better, then Heathens, and Publicans, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all their piety and knowledge.</p>
               <p>So that, in brief, all wilfully ignorant and ſcandalous are to be excommunicated; and not onely they, but the knowing, and blameleſſe of life, if they preſent not themſelves to the Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. Theſe things premiſed, lying ſadly on our ſpirits and conſciences, as not ſound and orthodox, for which we cannot ſo readily joyn with you, till further ſatisfaction be given us, and which the publiſher of your Paper promiſed ſhould be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to all that did deſire, We therefore thought fit to ſignifie theſe our ſcruples to you, and ſhall wait earneſtly for a ſpeedy ſatisfaction in the particulars, remaining</p>

                  <p>WE have peruſed your Paper, and doe finde in it ſundry miſtakes, and ſome manifeſt wreſtings of our plain meaning, in that Paper of ours, which was publiſhed in our ſeveral Congregations: And we are alſo ſenſible of the ſharp reflections in it, upon the Government, that is committed to our mannage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and on our ſelves. But we ſhall not go about to anſwer you in that kind: and therefore laying aſide animoſities, and putting away gall and bitterneſſe, in the ſpirit of love and meekneſſe, however in faithfulneſſe and plainneſſe, we ſhall endeavour to ſhew you your errors and rectifie your miſtakes. And we do thus far acknowledge your fair dealing, (for which we give you hearty thanks) that you addreſſe your ſelves unto
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:119100:40"/>
us, giving us thereby the opportunity, both to vindicate our ſelves, and give you a right underſtanding of the matters where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you are miſtaken.</p>
                  <p>Our leaſure will not permit us to ſpend time about imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencies; but yet, that you may not conceive we are deſtitute of civil Authority, (which you in your Paper minde us not to contemn, and we our ſelves do profeſſedly teſtifie all due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects unto, as in duty we are bound) we intreat you to take notice, That the Lords and Commons aſſembled in Parliament, having reſolved to eſtabliſh the Presbyterian Government throughout the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> and Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> did <hi>Auguſt</hi> 19. 1645. publiſh their directions, after advice had with the Aſſembly of Divines, for the electing and chuſing of ruling Elders in all the Congregations, and in the Claſſical Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies for the Cities of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Counties of the Kingdom, for the ſpeedy ſettling of the Presbyterian Government. In theſe directions, (as may be ſeen <hi>pag.</hi> 8.) they did ordain, <hi>That in the ſeveral Counties cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain perſons, Ministers and others, ſhould be appointed by authority of Parliament, who ſhould conſider, how the ſeveral Counties reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively might be most conveniently divided into diſtinct Claſſical Presbyteries; and what Miniſters and others were fit to be of each Claſſis. And that they ſhould accordingly make ſuch diviſion and nomination of perſons for each Claſſical Presbytery. Which diviſions and perſons ſo named for every diviſion, the appointed ſhould be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified up to the Parliament.</hi> And they further appointed, <hi>That the ſaid ſeveral Claſſes reſpectively being approved by Parliament, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their ſeveral precincts ſhould have power to conſtitute Congregational Elderſhips.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>According to theſe directions, the perſons by them appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for this County met, and did conſider, how it might be moſt conveniently divided into diſtinct Claſſical Presbyteries, and what Miniſters and others were fit to be of each Claſſis: and alſo made ſuch a diviſion and nomination accordingly, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified the ſame up to the Parliament: All which being done, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their directions and appointment, It was reſolved by the Lords and Commons aſſembled in Parliament, <hi>Oct.</hi> 2. 1646. <hi>That they did approve of the diviſion of the County of</hi> Lancaſter
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:119100:40"/>
                     <hi>into nine Claſſical Presbyteries repreſented from the ſaid County.</hi> And it was further reſolved, <hi>That the ſaid Houſes did approve of the Miniſters and other perſons repreſented from the County of</hi> Lancaſter, <hi>as fit to be of the ſeveral and reſpective Claſſes, into which the ſaid County was divided.</hi> Which diviſion of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty into nine Claſſical Presbyteries, and the approval there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of by the ſaid Lords and Commons was forthwith printed and publiſhed. In this diviſion ſo made and approved, <hi>The firſt Claſſis is to contain</hi> Mancheſter <hi>Pariſh,</hi> Preſtwich <hi>Pariſh,</hi> Oldham <hi>Pariſh,</hi> Flixton <hi>Pariſh,</hi> Eccles <hi>Pariſh, and</hi> Aſhton <hi>under-line Pariſh,</hi> as by what was then printed, and is yet extant, is to be ſeen. Further, we wiſh you to take notice, That in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Directions <hi>pag.</hi> 3. <hi>Direction</hi> 6. it is there thus or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, <hi>That all Pariſhes and places whatſoever (as well privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged places and exempt Juriſdictions, as others) be brought under the Government of Congregational, Claſſical, and National Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies. Provided, that the Chappels or places in the houſes of the Peers of this Realm ſhould continue free for the exerciſe of Divine Duties, to be performed according to the Directory.</hi> And alſo, that it was ordered by the Lords and Commons aſſembled in Parliament, <hi>Decemb.</hi> 21. 1646. <hi>That the ſeveral Claſſes in</hi> Lancaſhire <hi>ſhould be one Province,</hi> as appears by their Order to that purpoſe; As there is alſo another Order of theirs of <hi>Octob.</hi> 16. 1648. enabling the ſeveral Claſſes within this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince to ſend their Delegates to meet in a Provincial Aſſembly in <hi>Preſton,</hi> and appointing the time of their firſt meeting, the number of the Delegates, that were to be ſent to the ſaid Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, and the <hi>Quorum</hi> of the Aſſembly, according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion that had been made before by the Parliament, before any Provincial Aſſembly could by virtue of their Authority be ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to act Provincially. By which account thus given it is manifeſt, That the ſetting up the Presbyterian Government in this County: The diviſion of it into ſeveral Claſſes: The ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of thoſe Claſſes into a Province, and their Acting Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincially: As alſo the appointing this Claſſis to be the firſt, (that is, the firſt in regard of the number onely, the account beginning here) was all done by Authority of Parliament. And that, when we call our ſelves the firſt Claſſis within the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:119100:41"/>
Province of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> we are awarranted thereto by authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Parliament. And ſo your <hi>Saluting us in our own termes,</hi> (which we gave not to our ſelves, till the Parliament had firſt given them to us) will not ſeem ſtrange to them, that then did, or now do, acknowledge that Authority and Power, which the Parliament exerciſed in thoſe times. Eſpecially conſidering there was nothing done ſince, either by that Parliament or any other, or by his Highneſſe and the late Parliament, that takes from us what was then granted, and as we ſhall clear further anon.</p>

                  <p>IN your Preface to what in your Paper you have to ſay unto us, there is in the firſt place a miſtake of that title, which was given by us unto ours; (which you call a Paper draught) for it was not by us intituled a Preſentation (as you call it) but a <hi>Draught, that repreſented to the Provincial Aſſembly our appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions in a caſe by them propounded unto us;</hi> And was approved by the Provincial, under the Title of a <hi>Repreſentation.</hi> But this perhaps was but the miſtake of the Scribe, and we inſiſt not on it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is of greater weight and moment, to take notice of what you publiſh as your ſenſe and apprehenſions of it, (not reſting in the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or determination of any general Council contrary thereunto) if any ſuch ſhould be, much leſſe to one of our Provincial Aſſemblies. Although you tell us, we ſeem to ſubmit to our Provincial, what we will hardly grant to a general Council; in which you profeſſe to differ from us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We know very well, and have learned better from the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, then to reſolve our Faith into the determination of any company of men on Earth whatſoever, or to build our Faith on the Judgement of Synods, Provincial or National, or of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councils, that have been heretofore, or that may be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. We are ſure all men are fallible; and Faith, that is a
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:119100:41"/>
ſure and certain Grace, muſt have a ſure and certain foundation, which is onely the infallible and written Word of God. And if this only be your meaning, you have not us differing from you. But yet when we conſider, That Synods and Councils, rightly conſtituted and regularly called, as they may be then of great uſe for light and guidance, ſo alſo that they are the Ordinance of God, and by him inveſted with authority, and ſo have an autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritative Judgement belonging to them, and which is not in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſons, we dare not contemn them, nor ſpeak ſleightly of them. And ſeeing the higher Aſſemblies have greater Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty then the lower, (as there is more power in the whole, then in the part; in the whole body, then in any one, or ſome few mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers) and that, however we are well enough ſatisfied, that we have the Authority of a Claſſe, yet we are under the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Provincial Aſſembly; We ſee not wherein we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, that we ſubmitted our apprehenſions, in the Caſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by that Aſſembly unto us, unto their Judgment. There is concerning matters of Religion <hi>Judicium Privatum,</hi> or <hi>a Private Judgement;</hi> and this belongs to all Chriſtians, who are to ſee with their own eyes, and judge, concerning what is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for them to know and believe in matters of this nature. This Judgement, as there is good reaſon why we ſhould allow it to our ſelves, ſo we ſhould Lord it over mens conſciences, if we ſhould deny it to any. There is alſo <hi>Judicium Publicum, &amp; Authoritativum, A Publick and an Authoritative Judgement;</hi> and this is either Concional, which belongs to every lawful Miniſter (to whom the Key of Doctrine is committed) by himſelf ſingly: or elſe it is Juridical, and this belongs to Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods and Councils, who having the Key of Diſcipline, are inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted with authority to inquire into, try, examine, cenſure and judge of matters of Doctrine and Diſcipline authoritatively, (although they be tyed to the rule of Gods Word in ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, as Judges to the Law) and likewiſe to cenſure offenders according to their merit, when ſuch caſes are regularly and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly brought before them. And in this ſenſe it was, that we ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted our apprehenſions in the Paper publiſhed, to the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Provincial Aſſembly. And we believe, when the Apoſtle tels us, 1 Cor. 14. 32. <hi>That the ſpirits oſ the Prophets are
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:119100:42"/>
ſubject to the Prophets:</hi> And our Saviour Chriſt-ſaith, Mat. 18. <hi>

                        </gap>ell the Church;</hi> And when we conſider what was practiſed by <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> and certain others (who upon occaſion of a conteſt that aroſe in the Church at <hi>Antioch</hi> about a matter of Doctrine, were ſent up from that Church to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to the Apoſtles and Elders about that queſtion) from theſe and other Scriptural grounds we had ſufficient ground for ſo doing. We are ſure alſo, That <hi>Whitaker de Conciliis quaeſtione quinta,</hi> and <hi>Chamierus</hi> in his <hi>Panſtratia de oecumenico Pontifice, ubi de Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritate Papae in Eccleſia, cap.</hi> 13. <hi>&amp; cap.</hi> 14. And generally all our Proteſtant Divines againſt the Papiſts, alledging the Texts above-mentioned and others, do prove abundantly, that in the ſenſe declared, the Pope is to be ſubject to a general Council, wherein alſo ſundry Papiſts do concur with them. And queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onleſs, if in the time of <hi>Auguſtine</hi> (who was no contemner of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods and Councils) any in this ſenſe had declared, that they would not have ſubmitted their apprehenſions to their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he would have cried out againſt them as well as againſt the Donatiſts, <hi>O impudentem vocem!</hi> And we hope, when you have weighed the matter better, you will not in this ſenſe ſee any reaſon to refuſe to ſubmit either your ſenſe and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of our Paper, or what you may publiſh as your own private Judgements in other matters about Religion, to the Judgement of a general Council, ſuppoſing it might be had.</p>

                  <p>WE have now done with your Preface, and come to the matter it ſelf, wherein you profeſſe,</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) <hi>To joyn with us in a deep ſenſe of the ſeveral groſſe ſins and errors of the times, deſiring earneſtly to mourn firſt for your own ſins, next for the ſixs of others, &amp;c.</hi> And here we do hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily pray, that neither we nor you may any of us condemn our ſelves, either by profeſſing our ſorrow, for what ſins we may
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:119100:42"/>
practiſe, or by refuſing to help forward the good that we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe to allow of, but may teſtifie the truth of our ſorrow for our own and other mens ſins, by ſuitable indeavors to reform what is amiſſe in our ſelves, and helping forward every one in his place the reformation of others.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2-) In the next place, you ſay, <hi>You are alſo ſenſible with us that there are ſundry perſons groſly ignorant in the mainpoints of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion.</hi> And if ſo, we hope you will acknowledge, that where, after the injoying of plenty of Preaching and the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Catechizing, that hath been uſed for many years together, (and much more where there hath been leſſe of this meanes) many continue groſly ignorant in the main points of Religion, it is at leaſt not to be condemned in ſuch Miniſters, as ſhall be willing to take the paines by private Catechizing to inſtruct ſuch perſons: This courſe being to the Miniſters a matter of paines onely; and that hereupon, where the publick Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techizing attaines not its deſired end, the private may be good and uſeful, that ſo poor ſouls periſh not for lack of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3.) Laſtly <hi>You hope, That we with you are ſenſible and grei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, though,</hi> you ſay, <hi>we do not mention them, for the groſſe errors in judgement and damnable Doctrines of many, who have rent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into as many ſeveral Hereſies, as they have into Sects and Schiſms.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You may perceive by the title of our Paper, that it was a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of our apprehenſions to the Provincial Aſſembly, in the Caſe to us propounded by the ſaid Provincial, and what that was, we ſhall particularly declare anon, (although by what we ſay had been complained of, and repreſented unto us, it might be gathered) and therefore we were chiefly to apply our ſelves to that, which was therein our main work and buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. That the groſſe and damnable errors, that the looſneſs of theſe times have brought forth, are to be bewailed (if it were poſſible) with tears of bloud, is moſt freely to be confeſſed. And whether we lay them not to heart in ſome poor meaſure, God the ſearcher of all hearts he knows; as what complaints have been made of theſe by the members of this Claſſis, both in their prayers and preaching, men can witneſſe; and likewiſe
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:119100:43"/>
what teſtimonies have been given to the truth of Jeſus Chriſt, and againſt the errors of the times, ſubſcribed with their hands and publiſhed to the world, though therein but concurring with the reſt of their Reverend Brethren in this Province, in the Province of <hi>London,</hi> and other Counties of the Land, poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty may read, when we are in our graves. But as to the moſt of the Congregations belonging to this Claſſis, the great buſineſs to be looked after was the uſe of our beſt indeavors, for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of the ignorant, and the reforming of the ſcandalous, the numbers of theſe being great, and of thoſe that are ſo groſly erroneous as to maintain damnable doctrines, and whereof you profeſſe your ſelves to be ſo ſenſible, very inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, in compariſon of the former: and in ſundry of our Congregations, if not in moſt, (bleſſed be God for it) not any at all, that we know of. And therefore there was not that reaſon to make any ſuch expreſſe mention of theſe as of the former, although in our Paper we were not herein neither altogether ſilent, as will after appear.</p>
                  <p>Having profeſſed your agreement with us thus farre, you go on to declare your ſelves, <hi>That, touching the way of informing the ignorant, and reforming the wicked and erroneous, you ſhall not much diſsent.</hi> And</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) You ſay, <hi>For the Information and inſtruction of the ignorant by way of Catechizing before they be admitted to the Sacrament, the courſe by us publiſhed (provided, you ſay, it be in publick) little differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from the Order preſcribed by the Church of</hi> England, <hi>and other Reformed Churches abroad, before any be admitted to the Sacrament of the Lords Sapper.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That all Children and others, (ſo many as it is fit to inſtruct after that manner) be publickly catechized, is that, which we heartily wiſh had been and were more generally practiſed in our own Church at home, as it is practiſed by the Reformed Churches abroad. And certainly, had the publick catechizing of Children and others been more generally and conſtantly pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed, there had not been that cauſe to complain of the groſſe ignorance of ſundry perſons of ripe years, and ſome of them Governours of Families, as now there is. We do alſo underſtand you by what you do here expreſſe, that you judge it not meet,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:119100:43"/>
that the groſly ignorant ſhould be admitted to the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, in that you ſeem to approve of the practice of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches abroad, (as of our own at home) in taking courſe to inform the ignorant, before they admit them to the Sacrament of the Lords Supper; And therefore we ſee not how you can in reaſon deny, but there ought to be an examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and trial of all perſons, before they be admitted to the Lords Supper, that ſo the groſly ignorant may not be admitted, as they might be, if all promiſcuouſly were admitted without any tryal at all.</p>
                  <p>But whereas, in this conceſſion about catechizing, you have a <hi>Proviſo,</hi> that it be in publick, we doe not ſee, why you ſhould ſo limit it, if it be confeſſed, that it is neceſſary, that the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant ſhould be informed, and that catechizing is an uſeful means to attain that end. You know how it would daſh ſundry know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſons to be catechized publickly in the Congregation. But as for thoſe that are conſcious to themſelves, that they are very ignorant, if theſe ſhould be called forth to publique Catechizing, it were more likely to drive them from the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Aſſembly, and ſo from the uſe of all means for their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, then beavailable to this end. As touching what was propounded by us in our paper, as the way for their infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation (though it was not intended for any ſuch a purpoſe as to exclude publique Catechizing) it was done in way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion to the weakeſt, and to ſhew our willingneſs to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply our ſelves to any courſe, ſo we might be inſtrumental to bring poor dark and blinde Souls to the knowledge of Chriſt, and which in our Judgement is more likely to be attained in many, as the caſe ſtands with them, in a more private way of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techizing in any of the wayes propounded by us, then if we ſhould Catechize all the ſeveral Families publiquely before the whole Congregation.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) Touching thoſe <hi>that erre ſo groſly, whether in Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals or points of diſcipline, thereby renting from a true conſtituted Church,</hi> you ſay, <hi>we ſpeak nothing, either of their ſin or puniſhment, yet you hope, we with you do hold, that the Churches lawful Paſtors have the power of the keyes committed to them, to excommunicate ſuch offenders.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:119100:44"/>
We have given you the reaſon already, why we made not ſuch expreſs mention of theſe offenders, as of the former, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though (as you will hereafter perceive) we are not wholly ſilent touching either the ſin or puniſhment of theſe. Onely at preſent, becauſe you profeſſe to allow of that previous courſe of admonition preſcribed by Chriſt, in reference to the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. before they be excommunicated, but here ſay nothing of any ſuch courſe to be taken with the heretical or ſchiſmatical; (though we hope alſo of you, that you diſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it not) we ſhall briefly declare, what courſe is to be held by the rules of the Presbyterian Government, before the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of excommunication paſſe againſt theſe offenders, and whereof our paper was not ſilent. This Government, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it gives no toleration to <hi>any ſuch errors, as ſubvert the faith; or any other errours, which overthrow the power of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſse; if the party, who holds them, ſpreads them, ſeeking to draw others after him, or to any ſuch practiſes, as in their own nature manifeſtly ſubvert that order, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity and Peace, which Chriſt hath eſtabliſhed in his Church.</hi> Theſe being offences cenſured by this Government, (and of which further after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,) yet this Government preſcribes the exerciſe of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and long-ſuffering (even toward thoſe that do groſly erre in Doctrine as well as toward thoſe that are ſcandalous in life) in the uſe of all means for the convincing them of their errours; by reaſoning with them out of the Scriptures: as we ſee was practiſed in the Synod, that was held at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and as we ſee the Fathers of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, did not diſdain to reaſon and diſpute with <hi>Arrius</hi> (though he denyed the Deity of Chriſt) before they condemned him: And as alſo other Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did with other Hereticks in the Synods, although often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in vain. That ſo none might have any juſt cauſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, that they were condemned, before they fully heard. And as touching ſuch as run into ſuch practiſes, as in their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture tend manifeſtly to the ſubverting of that order and unity which Chriſt hath eſtabliſhed in the Church, it labours with theſe alſo in the uſe of all gentle means to reclaim them, and bring them back again to the Church they have rent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from, before it proceed to cenſure.

difference between the ſeducers, and ring-leaders of a Sect, and thoſe that are miſled; having reſpect not only to the nature of the offence, but alſo to the quality of the offender; and exerciſeth patience and forbearance towards all, ſo long as there is any hope of reducing them by milder correction: Being ever more deſirous to heal, then cut off any member. And thus having declared our ſelves in this, we goe on with you.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3.) For you ſay; <hi>For ſuch as are ſcandalous and wicked in their lives, admonition private and publique is to be obſerved, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Christs rule,</hi> Mat. 18. <hi>But if they still continue, and will not reform, the Churches lawful Paſtors have power to excommunicate ſuch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this you fully come up to what we hold, as to the meanes, that is to be uſed for the reformation of theſe, and we are glad there is an agreement in judgement betwixt you and us thus far. Neither can we ſee how, upon this conceſſion, you can in reaſon finde fault with our proceedings, if there ſhould be occaſion for our cenſuring any ſuch perſons, as for their notorious offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and their obſtinacy therein, might juſtly merit the higheſt cenſure.</p>
                  <p>For however, perhaps you may ſay, you ſtumble chiefly at this, that our ruling Elders (that in your judgement may be but meer Lay-men) do joyn in the Gouernment with us; yet we ſee not how this can be any juſt ground of ſcruple to any of you, who (if we miſtake not) were all of you ſatisfied in your conſciences touching the lawfulneſs of the late Government of Epiſcopacy as it was then exerciſed, at leaſt as to ſubmiſſion to it; and wherein High-Commiſſioners, Chancelors, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſaries (that were as much Lay-men then, as ruling Elders can be in your judgement now) had ſo great a ſhare, as to ſuſpend Miniſters from the exerciſe of their Miniſtry, upon ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints as, according to the orders, that were appointed in thoſe dayes, they might take cognizance of, and ſo far, as to decree the ſentence of excommunication againſt them and others, as there was occaſion for it.</p>
                  <p>But here we muſt yet further profeſs, we do not know, whom you mean by lawful Paſtors, to whom you here grant the power
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:119100:45"/>
of excommunication. Some we know, there are, that would make the Dioceſan Biſhops the onely Paſtors of the Church, <note place="margin">Dr. Hamm.</note> and that other Miniſters do but officiate by deputation from them and under them. We hope you are not of the minde of theſe. For then, as the diſſent in judgement betwixt you and us would be farre greater, than as yet we apprehend it is; ſo hence it would follow, that, till Prelacy ſhould be reſtored, there muſt not (if you would provide for the ſafety of the perſons and eſtates of them that ſhould mannage the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) be the diſpenſing of any Church cenſures at all. For you may eaſily know, that not only by Acts and Ordinances of Parliament before made for the aboliſhing of Archbiſhops and Biſhops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (and which are confirmed by the late hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Advice aſſented unto by his Highneſſe <hi>ſect.</hi> 12.) the office and juriſdiction of Dioceſan Biſhops is taken away; But there is yet a further Barre put in againſt Prelacy in the 11. <hi>ſect.</hi> of the aforeſaid humble Advice; where it is expreſly cautioned, (and we judge it was out of a conſcientious mindfulneſs of what had been in thoſe very termes covenanted againſt) that the liberty, that is granted to ſome, be not extended to Popery and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy. And therefore if any Dioceſan Biſhop ſhould exerciſe his juriſdiction, and excommunicate any perſon within this Land, wherein by Authority (as you may ſee afterward) there is alſo an appointment of another Government, we leave it to thoſe, that are learned in the Law to determine, whether ſuch Dioceſan Biſhops would not run themſelves into a <hi>prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if you do not reſtrain lawful Paſtors to theſe onely, out doubt yet is, Whether you mean not onely ſuch Miniſters, as were ordained by Dioceſan Biſhops, excluding thoſe out of the number, that, ſince their being taken away, have been ordained by Presbyters only?</p>
                  <p>If this be your ſenſe, we ſhall onely at preſent minde you, of what is publiſhed, to be the Judgement of Doctor <hi>

And in the cloſe of his Anſwer about this point he ſaith; <hi>That for the teſtifying of his Communion with the Churches</hi> (of the <hi>Low-Countryes)</hi> of whom he had ſpoken immediately before: and which he there profeſſeth, <hi>He doth love and bonour as true members of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church:</hi> (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the difference that was betwixt him and them about the point of Epiſcopacy) he doth profeſſe <hi>That with like affection he ſhould receive the bleſſed</hi> Sacrament <hi>at the hands of the Dutch Miniſters, if he were in</hi> Holland, <hi>as he ſhould do at the hands of the French Miniſters, if he were in</hi> Charenton. See <hi>pag.</hi> 125. and 126. Hence you may perceive, that the Judgement of Dr. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> was; That the Ordination of Presbyters, where Biſhops can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be had ſtandeth valid. And conſequently, if you be of his opinion, (and you muſt have ſtronger reaſon, then ever yet we have ſeen, to bear you out there in if you judge otherwiſe) they ought to bee eſteemed lawful Paſtors, to whom you grant the power of Excommunication, Biſhops being now taken away, and may not therefore ordain according to the preſent Laws of the Land.

That, which we ſubmitted wholly to the Judgement of the Provincial Aſſembly, was not, whether Catechizing was a way appointed by God in his Word, for the information of the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant; but in what way of Catechizing (as is expreſſed in our Paper) the ignorant in our Congregations, who never offered themſelves unto the Sacrament, were moſt like to be brought to ſome meaſure of knowledge; and which is not a matter of Doctrine but of Order onely. Neither was it by us ſubmitted to that Aſſembly; whether the cenſures of the Church were the meanes appointed by Chriſt for the reforming of the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous? But whether it might not be meet <hi>pro hic &amp; nunc,</hi> and as the preſent caſe ſtood, to apply the cenſures? (and ſo put in practice at this time that, which in the General we were ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently aſſured from the word of Truth, was the way for their reformation) and with which we were both by God and Man intruſted to diſpenſe, unto thoſe that were openly ſcandalous in our Congregations; However they contented themſelves to live in the want of the Lords Supper, nor ever preſented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Elderſhip to be admitted to it. And this (becauſe meerly circumſtantial, as to the diſpenſing of the Cenſures at this time and to ſuch Perſons) we think herein we owed the Provincial Aſſembly (unto whoſe Authority we profeſſe our ſelves to be ſubject) ſo much reſpect and duty, as to ſubmit our apprehenſions in a caſe of this nature (which they had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded unto us to be ſeriouſly weighed, as they had done to the reſt of the Claſſes within this Province) unto their Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to take their concurrent approval along with us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we proceeded to practiſe in a matter of this weight. And yet we have declared before, That however we are not ſo wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering and unſettled in matters of faith, as to reſolve our belief into the determination of <hi>Synods</hi> or Councils, believing no more, nor no otherwiſe, then as they determine: Yet that it is not out of the compaſſe of the authority of a <hi>Synod</hi> to examine, try and authoritatively to cenſure Doctrines as well as matters of Diſcipline. And we think (how confident ſoever you may be of the ſoundneſſe and orthodoxneſſe of what in your Paper you propound in way of exception againſt any thing in ours) you have not ſuch clear and unqueſtionable grounds from
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:119100:47"/>
Scripture for the ſame, that you were to be accuſed of wavering or unſettledneſs, if you had ſubmitted the ſame to have been examined and tried by a Provincial Aſſembly: and much leſſe if you could have had the opportunity of ſubmitting it to the Cenſure of a General Council.</p>
                  <p>But whereas mentioning our Provincial Aſſembly at <hi>Preſton,</hi> you call it a new termed <hi>Provincial Aſſembly;</hi> If your meaning be, that the terming it a Provincial Aſſembly inſtead of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial <hi>Synod</hi> is a new term, then this is but onely a <hi>Logo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machia,</hi> and not much to be inſiſted on. Although we fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently call it a Provincial <hi>Synod</hi> as well as a Provincial Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. But if your meaning be; <hi>That it is a new termed Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Aſſembly at</hi> Preſton; Becauſe Provinciall <hi>Synods</hi> or Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies have been held but lately at <hi>Preſton,</hi> we ſee not (if Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Aſſemblies be warrantable, and have been of ancient uſe in the Church) that having been long in diſ-uſe, they began of late to be held at <hi>Preſton,</hi> that can juſtly incurre your cenſure. But if the Antiquity of ſuch Aſſemblies be that you queſtion: Then we referre you to what Doctor <hi>Bernard</hi> in the Book of his above quoted, ſhews was the Judgement of Doctor <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> (who is acknowledged by all that knew him, or are acquainted with his works, to have been a great Antiquary; however we alleadge him not, that you ſhould build your faith upon his Teſtimony) and which we think may be ſufficient to vindicate Provincial Aſſemblies in your thoughts from all ſuſpition of novelty. In that Book you have in the cloſe of it propoſals touching the Reduction of Epiſcopacy unto the form of <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodical</hi> Government received in the ancient Church. And it thus begins. <hi>By the Order of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>all Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are charged to adminiſter the Doctrine and Sacraments, and the Diſcipline of Christ, as the Lord hath commanded, and as this Realm hath received. And that they might the better underſtand, what the Lord hath commanded herein, The exhortation of</hi> Paul <hi>to the Elders of</hi> Epheſus, Acts 20. 28. <hi>is appointed to be read unto them at the time of their Ordination.</hi> A little after it is aknowledged, <hi>That</hi> Ignatius <hi>by Presbytery mentioned by</hi> Paul, 1 Tim. 4. 14. <hi>did underſtand the Community of the reſt of the Presbyters or El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, who then had a hand, not onely in the delivery of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:119100:47"/>
and Sacraments, but alſo in the adminiſtration of the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of Chriſt.</hi> And for further proof, Tertullian <hi>is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged in his Generall Apologie for Chriſtians. Where he ſaith, that in the Church are uſed exhortations, chaſtiſements and divine cenſure; For Judgement is given with great advice, as among thoſe, who are certain, they are in the ſight of God. And it is the chiefeſt foreſhewing of the Judgement to come, if any man have ſo offended, that he be baniſhed from the Communion of Prayer, and of the Aſſembly, and of all holy Fellowſhip The Preſidents, that bear rule therein, are certain approved Elders, who have obtained this honour, not by reward, but by good report. There alſo is further ſhewed, That in matters of Eccleſiaſtical judicature,</hi> Cornelius <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of</hi> Rome <hi>uſed the received form of gathering together the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery. And that</hi> Cyprian <hi>ſufficiently declares of what Perſons that conſiſted; When he wiſheth him to read his Letter to the flouriſhing Clergy, which there did preſide or rule with him. And further, That in the fourth Council of Carthage it was concluded, That the Biſhop might hear no mans cauſe without the preſence of the Clergy. And that otherwiſe the Biſhops ſentence ſhould be void, unleſſe it were confirmed by the Clergy. And yet further. That this is found inſerted into the Canons of</hi> Egbert <hi>(who was Archbiſhop of</hi> York <hi>in the</hi> Saxon <hi>times) and afterwards into the body of the Canon law it ſelf. It is here alſo acknowledged, That in our Church this kind of Presbyterian Government hath been much diſuſed. Yet that it did profeſſe, that every Paſtor hath a right to rule the Church (from whence alſo the name of Rector was at firſt given to him) and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter the Diſcipline of Chriſt, as well as to diſpenſe the Doctrine and Sacraments,</hi> &amp;c. By all which it is acknowledged, and alſo proved; That the form of Government by the united ſuffrages of the Clergy, is ancient: and which is there in expreſs termes aſſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ted; as it might be demonſtrated by many more Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, but that we conceive theſe already mentioned are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and being alleadged by the aforementioned Author, As alſo evidencing what his own Judgement was in this point, may be more likely to ſway with you (if in that there ſhould be a diſſent betwixt you and us) then any thing, that we could our ſelves produce. But in this reduction of Epiſcopacy to the form of <hi>Synodical</hi> Government received in the ancient
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:119100:48"/>
Church, there are propoſals of Aſſemblies of Paſtors within certain limited bounds, which (ſaving that they are ſome of them ſomewhat larger then ours, which is but a circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial difference) doe hold proportion with the Claſſical, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial, and National Aſſemblies, mentioned in the form of our Church Government; as alſo the times propounded there for their meeting, the power of theſe Aſſemblies, and what they were to have Cognizance of, and the ſubordination of the leſſer to the greater, with liberty of Appeal, if need ſhould require, and are the ſame in ſubſtance as with us. And all theſe were propounded, as the way of Government in the ancient Church, and in the year 1641. (after the troubles, that had riſen in <hi>Scotland</hi> about Epiſcopacy and the Ceremonies, and before the ſetting up of the Presbyterian Government in this Land, had ſo much as fallen under debate in the Parliament, ſo far as ever we heard of) as an expedient to prevent the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, that did after ariſe in this Land about the matter of Church Government, being for the moderating of Epiſcopacy, that at that time was grown to that height, that it had quite ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away from the Paſtors that rule, that of right did belong unto them; And for the Reduction of it to the ancient form of <hi>Synodical</hi> Government. And therefore in the Judgement of this learned and reverend Antiquary, our Provincial Aſſembly at <hi>Preſton</hi> (where the Paſtors of the Churches are members, as he acknowledgeth of right they ought to be in ſuch Aſſemblies) would not have been accounted a new termed Provincial Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly.</p>

But the Ordinance eſpecially, from which chiefly (as we conceive) the miſtake aroſe about ſettling the Presbyterian Government for three years onely, was the Ordinance that paſſed <hi>June</hi> 5. 1646; The title whereof is, <hi>An Ordinance of the Lords and Commons Aſſembled in Parliament, for the preſent ſettling (without further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay) of the Presbyterial Government in the Church of</hi> England: In the Cloſe whereof it is ordained; <hi>That this Ordinance ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue for the ſpace of three yeares, and no longer, unleſſe both Houſes think fit to continue it. But if the matter of this Ordinance be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted, it is manifeſt it was but touching a Committee of Lords and Commons to adjudge and determine ſcandalous offences not formerly enumerated, appointed by that Ordinance, in ſtead and place of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners mentioned in the Ordinance of</hi> March 14. 1645; <hi>And alſo ſhewing how the Elderſhips were to proceed in the examination of ſuch ſcandalous offences; And touching what power was granted to the ſaid Committee, and in what ſort they were to proceed, as is clear to any, that ſhall but take the pains to peruſe that Ordinance;</hi> The ground whereof in the preface to it, is made to be this; <hi>The Lords and Commons in Parliament holding their former reſolution, that all notorious and ſcandalous offenders ſhall be kept from the Sacrament,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:119100:49"/>
have thought fit to make a further addition to the ſcandalous offences formerly enumerated, for which men ſhall be kept back from the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; And leaſt the ſtay of the enumeration, and the not naming of Commiſſioners to judge of Caſes not enumerated, ſhould hinder the putting in execution the Presbyterian Government already eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, They have thought fit,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And doe therefore-ordain a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee (therein particularly nominated) in ſtead and place of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The groundleſneſſe of the miſtake about ſettling the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Government for three years onely (that might ariſe from the proviſo in this Ordinance) is ſo clear to any common underſtanding, that the bare recital of the ſum of the matter of this Ordinance, and the ground of making it, doth make it ſo fully to appear, that it were but loſt labour to uſe any more words about it. But we have particularly mentioned all that ever paſſed the Parliament (ſo farre as we have either ſeen or heard of) that hitherto concerned Church Government, untill the year 1648; <hi>When the form of Church Government to be uſed in the Church of</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Ireland, <hi>was agreed upon by the Lords and Commons Aſſembled in Parliament, after Advice had with the Aſſembly of Divines, and was ordered by them to be printed</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt 19. <hi>of the ſaid</hi> year 1648. And this Ordinance (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in all that had paſſed the Parliament before in parts, and at ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times, and what ever was but temporary, by vertue of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ordinances (ſo far as was intended for continuance) are moulded up into a complete body, with a ſupply of ſundry things that had been never mentioned nor publiſhed before in other Ordinances) is without any limitation of time for its continuance, and remains unrepealed to this day, for any thing we have ſeen or heard to the contrary. Nay we think (as we ſhall touch upon anon) That by the humble Advice, aſſented to by his Highneſſe, this Ordinance (as well as others) receives ſtrength.</p>
                  <p>But by this full account given, we think we have made it ſufficiently to appear, that we have had the Authority of the civil Magiſtrate to bear us out, in what we have acted ſince the firſt ſetting up of the Presbyterian Government untill this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; Except there be any, that can come forth, and charge
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:119100:50"/>
us to have tranſgreſſed the rules, appointed by the Parliament for us to obſerve in our actings, againſt which our own inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency onely ſhall be our defence.</p>
                  <p>It now remaines, for your further ſatisfaction, and our own vindication, that we recite ſome things particularly out of the form of Church Government, which we conceive are thereunto ſubſervient.</p>
                  <p>In the very firſt Words of the Ordinance (according to what we have before recited in the directions for the electing and chooſing of ruling Elders, and is there alſo to be found) you may find it thus; <hi>Be it ordered and ordained by the Lords and Commons in Parliament Aſſembled, and by Authority of the ſame, That all Pariſhes and Places whatſoever within the</hi> Kingdom <hi>of</hi> England <hi>and Dominion of</hi> Wales, <hi>(as well Priviledged Places and exempted juriſdictions as others) be brought under the Government of Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, Claſſical, Provincial and National Aſſemblies,</hi> &amp;c. Whence it is to us unqueſtionable, That by vertue of this appointment, ſuch as live within the bounds of our ſeveral Congregations and Pariſhes are under the power of ſome one or other of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational Elderſhips, conſtituted by Authority of Parliament within our ſeveral Pariſhes; And that all thoſe that live within the bounds of our Claſſis (mentioned before) are under the power of our Claſſical Aſſembly, conſtituted in like manner by the ſaid Authority.</p>
                  <p>What power is given particularly to the congregational El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſhips, you may finde in the aforeſaid form of Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and unto which we refer you; onely we ſhall minde you, <hi>That by vertue thereof, they have power, as they ſhall ſee juſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, to enquire into the knowledge and ſpiritual eſtate of any member of the Congregation, to admoniſh, and rebuke, to ſuſpend from the Lords Table, thoſe who are found by them, to be ignorant and ſcandalous, and to excommunicate according to the rules and directions after following.</hi> And it is thereby ordained, <hi>That the Examination and Judgement of ſuch Perſons, as ſhall for their ignorance in the points of Religion, mentioned in that Ordinance, not be admitted to the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, is to be in the power of the Elderſhip of every Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> All which will appear by the expreſſe Letter of the ſaid Ordinance, to any, that will conſult it, and which not onely
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:119100:50"/>
juſtifies all that is practiſed, in that caſe, by the ſeveral Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, but alſo ſhews what grounds this Claſſis had for that which was mentioned in our Paper, touching both what is therein appointed to the Miniſter about Catechizing Families, and alſo concerning the Miniſters exhorting ſuch, as in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Families he ſhould finde to be of competent knowledge, and know to be of blameleſſe life, That they ſhould preſent themſelves to the Elderſhip; The Trial and Judgement in this caſe not belonging to any one Miniſter alone, but to the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſhip.</p>
                  <p>There are alſo rules and directions given in this Ordinance to be obſerved by the ſeveral Elderſhips, concerning ſuſpenſion from the Sacrament of the Lords Supper in caſes of ſcandal, which may be ſeen there particularly. But there is no rule gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that will allow either the Elderſhip or Claſſis, according to the ſeveral powers to them therein granted, either to warn before all, or to excommunicate knowing and blameleſſe men for their meer not preſenting themſelves before the Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
                  <p>The rules of this Government preſcribe otherwiſe; as we our ſelves muſt alſo needs profeſſe, that we are not conſcious to our ſelves, that we have given any juſt occaſion by our manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof, That contrary to the expreſſe rules appointed therein to be obſerved by us, and to the plain ſenſe of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions uſed in our Paper (of which afterward,) any ſuch a thing, ſhould have been ſo much as ſuppoſed, to have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended from any thing there expreſſed.</p>
                  <p>Give us leave to proceed a little further, to lay open the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that is preſcribed in the above mentioned form of Church Government, touching the order of proceeding to excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; which as it will awarrant the publiſhing of mens names openly in the Congregation, and warning them before all to reform, being ſuch as are juſtly cenſurable by the rules there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and particularly where it preſcribes, <hi>that ſeveral publique ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions ſhall be given to the offenders,</hi> &amp;c. So it will awarrant us in any thing, that is made cenſurab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e by that Paper of ours, that was publiſhed.</p>
                  <p>To make this to appear, as alſo to ſhew what reaſon, we had
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:119100:51"/>
to make known to the ſeveral congregations within our bounds what our paper held forth. We ſhall here declare, what offences are cenſurable with this greateſt and laſt cenſure of Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, according to the order, that is there preſcribed, and which, as it requires, <hi>that it be inflicted with great and mature deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration, and after all other good means have been eſſayed;</hi> ſo it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points in theſe expreſſe words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That ſuch Errours in practice as ſubvert the Faith, or any other Errours, which overthrow the power of Godlineſſe; if the party who holds them, ſpread them, ſeeking to draw others after him; and ſuch ſins in practice, as cauſe the Name and Truth of God to be blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed, cannot ſtand with the power of godlineſſe; and ſuch practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as in their own nature manifeſtly ſubvert that order, unity and Peace, which Chriſt hath eſtabliſhed in his Church; and particularly all thoſe ſcandalous ſins, for which any Perſon is to be ſuſpended from the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, obſtinately perſiſted in; theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing publiquely known, to the juſt ſcandal of the Church; The ſentence of Excommunication may and ought to proceed, according to the directions after following.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But the Perſons, that hold other Errours in Judgement, about which learned and Godly men poſſibly may and do differ, and which ſubvert not the faith, nor are deſtructive to godlineſs, or that be guilty of ſuch ſins of infirmity, as are commonly found in the Children of God: or being otherwiſe ſound in the faith, and holy in life (and ſo not falling under cenſure by the former rules) endeavour to keep the unity of the ſpirit in the bond of peace; and do yet out of conſcience, not come up to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of all thoſe rules, which are or ſhall be eſtabliſhed by Authority, for regulating the outward worſhip of God, and Government of his Church; The ſentence of excommunication for theſe cauſes ſhall not be denounced againſt them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe things this Claſſis taking into conſideration, together with the power they were betruſted with by God and Man, for the diſpenſing the cenſures of the Church, in the caſes cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurable by the rules here laid down and elſewhere, in the form of Church Government: And there having been in the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Aſſembly ſeveral debates touching ſuch Perſons as in the ſeveral Congregations were ignorant and ſcandalous, who of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered not themſelves to the Sacrament, nor to the Elderſhip in
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:119100:51"/>
order to their admiſſion to it: and they commending it to the ſeveral Claſſical Presbyteries to be conſidered of, whether ſome further courſe was not to be held, for the information of the one, and the reformation of the other, then yet had been taken, notwithſtanding their neglect; and what they judged fitteſt to be done for the attaining thoſe ends; and to repreſent their thoughts therein to the next Aſſembly; This Claſſis upon the whole concluded, to repreſent their apprehenſions in the Caſe, as is expreſſed in the Paper that was publiſhed, which was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of before by the Provincial Aſſembly, and which they judge is ſufficiently awarranted, in regard of any thing therein contained, by the rules expreſſed in the above-mentioned form of Church Government.</p>
                  <p>We having thus far ſhewed what we have been, and are awarranted to practice, by the ſeveral Ordinances above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, ſhall now proceed further to declare; That how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we are no Lawyers, and therefore leave the determination of the Caſe to the learned in the Law to judge of, to whom it belongs: yet if it may be lawful for us to judge of a matter of this nature from the principles of reaſon; It ſeems to us, that the above mentioned Ordinances about Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as well as other Ordinances of Parliament, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in the humble Advice aſſented unto by his Highneſſe in the 16. ſection thereof, where we finde theſe Words: <hi>And that nothing contained in this Petition and Advice, nor your Highneſſe conſent rhereunto, ſhall be conſtrued to extend to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing or making void of any Act or Ordinance, which is not contrary hereunto, or to the matters herein contained. But that the ſaid Acts and Ordinances, not contrary hereunto, ſhall continue and remain in force, in ſuch manner, as if this preſent Petition and Advice had not at all been had or made, or your Highneſſe conſent thereunto given.</hi> Whence we gather, that if in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Ordinances for Church Government, there be nothing contrary to the humble Advice, or to the matters therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, they are not thereby (any more then any other Acts or Ordinances of Parliament) repealed, but left to remain in force. At leaſt, there ſeems to us to be a plain intimation, that they have a force in them, which is not by this humble Advice
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:119100:52"/>
repealed and made void. For it doth not appear to us, That there is any thing in the form of Church Government, or any other Ordinances of Parliament about that matter; that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the humble Advice or matters therein contained. And whereas in the eleventh ſection, there is mention made of ſome, that differ in worſhip and diſcipline, from the publique profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of theſe Nations held forth, to whom ſome indulgence is granted; It ſeems to us, there is an acknowledgement and own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of what the late Parliament held forth, in regard of theſe, by the Directory for worſhip and form of Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which they paſſed, as the publique profeſſion of theſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in regard of worſhip and diſcipline. And in theſe apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions we are the more confirmed, becauſe here in this ſection, mention is made of a confeſſion of faith to be agreed on by his Highneſſe and the Parliament, there having nothing in that kind paſſed the late Parliament, that eſtabliſhed the Directory for worſhip and form of Church Government: However there had been a Confeſſion of faith drawn up by the late Aſſembly of Divines; Whence it ſeemes to us clear, that they own the Directory for worſhip, and the form of Church Government, to be that which they hold forth, as the publique profeſſion of the Nation for worſhip and Government. To the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe we finde in the Government of the Common-wealth of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> &amp;c. As it was publiquely declared at <hi>Weſtminſter Decemb.</hi> 16 1653. <hi>pag.</hi> 43. <hi>Sect.</hi> 37. <hi>Where alſo they expreſſe a worſhip and Diſcipline publiquely held forth, which muſt needs referre to the Directory and form of Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment by us recited;</hi> There being no other worſhip or diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, that then had, or now hath, the civil Sanction, in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>We have been large, in what we have here repreſented in the general, before we come to ſpeak more particularly to the reſt, that now follows in your paper. But our pains being the greater, to make this full repreſentation unto you, then it will be for you to read it, we muſt intreat you to excuſe us; conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering it tends as well to rectifie your miſtakes, as to vindicate our ſelves, being alſo deſirous, not to be miſtaken any more, as alſo becauſe it layes a foundation for our briefer and more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular

                  <p>IN the things, wherein you profeſſe your ſelves to diſſent, till further explicated and unfolded by us.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1) The firſt thing we meet with here is; That by the many Perſons of all ſorts, that are members of Congregations, and mentioned in our Paper, in your ſenſe thereof we ſeem to hint, that thereby we mean onely ſuch, <hi>who have admitted themſelves members of ſome Congregation within your aſſociation, and yet live inordinately,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And that therefore you, who never were any members or aſſociates of ours, are not within the verge and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of our Presbyterian diſcipline,</hi> &amp;c. Unto which we ſay; That we have conſtantly profeſſed againſt thoſe of the ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: That the ſeveral Aſſemblies or Congregations within this Land, that make a profeſſion of the true Chriſtian and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolique Faith, are true Churches of Jeſus Chriſt.: That the ſeveral members of theſe Congregations are by their birth, members, as thoſe that were born in the Jewiſh Church, are ſaid to be, by the Apoſtle, Jewes by nature: <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. That this their memberſhip was ſealed to them in their Baptiſm, that did ſolemnly admit them, as into the univerſal Church, ſo into the particular, wherein they were born. We have alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly maintained againſt the afore-mentioned Perſons; That the Miniſters of theſe Churches are true Miniſters, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that exception of theirs againſt them, that they were ordained by Biſhops, who alſo themſelves were true Miniſters in our Judgement (though we cannot acknowledge, that by divine right they were ſuperiour to their fellow brethren, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in regard of order or juriſdiction) And that therefore the Word and Sacraments (the moſt eſſential marks of a true viſible Church, according to the profeſſed Judgement of our Divines againſt the Papiſts on the one hand, and thoſe of the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:119100:53"/>
ſeparation on the other) diſpenſed by theſe Viniſters, were, and are the true Ordinances of Jeſus Chriſt. And that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon our work was not (when the Presbyterian Government was appointed) to conſtitute Churches, but to reform them onely. And that therefore none within our bounds, except they ſhall renounce Chriſtianity and their Baptiſme, can be deemed by us to be without, in the Apoſtles ſenſe; and ſo there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not within the compaſs and verge of our Presbyterian Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. Neither is it their not aſſociating with us in regard of Government, that doth exempt them from cenſure by it, if they ſhould be ſuch offenders, as by the rules thereof were juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cenſurable. It not being a matter arbitrary, for private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons at their own will and pleaſure to exempt themſelves from under that Eccleſiaſtical Government, that is ſettled by Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: And as you know it would not have been allowed of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the former Government.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2) And therefore whether you, and all others within our bounds, be not comprehended within our Government, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rules laid down in the Ordinance of Parliament above mentioned, appointing the form of Church Government to be uſed in the Church of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and therein ordaining, as hath been recited before in the firſt page thereof, and to which we referre you; (Eſpecially conſidering, that all within the bounds of our ſeveral Pariſhes (that are no other now then formerly) even Papiſts, and Anabaptiſts, and other Sectaries, were under the late Prelatical Government) we leave it to you to judge. Onely if ſo, we wiſh you to conſider, that then you are brought under the Government of Presbytery, not ſo much by us, as by the Parliament appointing this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And then we think you, who warn us not to contemn civil power, might well (out of reſpect to the Authority or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining it, but eſpecially conſidering the word Presbytery is a known Scripture expreſſion, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4, and interpreted by ſundry of the Fathers, as we do, as hath been declared before) have uſed a more civil expreſſion, then to have called it a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon fold, into which (it ſhould ſeem) your complains it, that you ſhould be driven. Although Presbytery layes reſtraint on none, but ſuch as being ſcandalous in their lives, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:119100:53"/>
the Laws of God, are therefore truly and indeed the lawleſs Perſons, that we ſpeak of. But whereas (as you ſuppoſe?) <hi>This is our chief deſign in this, as in other tranſactions of ours, to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject all to our Government:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We doe refer our ſelves to our courſe of life paſt, and hope it will witneſſe with us, to all that will judge impartially, what our deſignes have been in our other tranſactions. And as touching our deſign in the Paper publiſhed, whether it hath been ought but the information of the ignorant, and refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the ſcandalous, to the Glory of God and their ſalvation, we leave it to be judged by thoſe, that will judge of mens intentions by what is expreſſed in their words and actions.</p>
                  <p>We know very well, we are charged by ſome, that we af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Dominion, to Lord it over the People, and to have all ſorts of Perſons, of what rank ſoever, to ſtoop to us. But we do openly profeſſe, that the Government of the Church, that is committed unto men, is not Deſpotical, but Miniſterial. That it is no Dominion, but a Miniſtery onely. And that the Officers, that are intruſted with it, are themſelves to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, both in regard of their bodies and eſtates, to the Civil power; That by the Ordinance of God, they are appointed to be under, and that in their Government they have nothing to do with the bodies and eſtates of any Perſons, but with their Souls onely. Although here we deſire to enquire of you, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if you be indeed for the ſettling of any Government at all in the Church (as you profeſſe to be) you do not think, that all ſhould be ſubject to it? We cannot judge you to be ſo irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, as to be for a Government, and that yet ſubiection to it muſt be denyed. And if the late Government of the Prelacy was not blamed by you, becauſe it required ſubjection to it; we wiſh you to conſider, whether upon this account you have reaſon to cenſure us. But further, whereas you tell us; <hi>That we garniſh over our Government with the ſpecious title of Christs Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, Throne, and Scepter:</hi> We wiſh you to conſider, what in your Anſwer to an objection (that you frame out of our Paper) your ſelves doe ſay. You there tell us; <hi>You pray for the eſtabliſhment of ſuch Church Government, as is conſonant to the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:119100:54"/>
will of God, and univerſal practice of primitive Churches: that Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Diſcipline may be exerciſed in the hands of them, to whom it was committed by Chriſt, and left by him to be transferred from hand to hand to the end of the World.</hi> The expreſſions, you here uſe, are as high touching that Government you would have eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, as any have been, that ever we have uſed of ours. For your prayer is, <hi>That Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline may be exerciſed in the hands of them, to whom it was committed by Chriſt, and left by him to be transferred from hand to hand to the end of the world.</hi> The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment then, that you are for, muſt be with you, Chriſts Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment Throne and Scepter. And why do you then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn us, if we have uſed ſuch expreſſions concerning our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, till you have convinced us, that it is not ſuch?

                  <p>BUt now you frame an objection out of our Paper, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn your Anſwer, profeſſing, <hi>That you pray for the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of ſuch Church Government throughout his Highneſſe Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, as is conſonant to the will of God, and univerſal practice of primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Churches,</hi> &amp;c. In that you do here joyn the will of God, and the univerſal practice of primitive Churches together, as you joyned the Word of God, and the conſtant practiſe of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church before; you ſeem to us, to make up the rule (whereby we muſt judge what Government it is, that you pray might be eſtabliſhed) of theſe two, <hi>viz.</hi> the will of God and the univerſal practiſe of primitive Churches: Or that it is the univerſal practiſe of primitive Churches, that muſt be our ſure guide and comment upon the Word of God, to tell us, what is his will revealed there touching Church Government and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline. If this be your ſenſe (as we apprehend it is) we muſt needs profeſſe, that herein we greatly differ from you, as not conceiving it to be ſound and orthodox. It being the Word of God alone, and the approved practiſe of the Church recorded there (whether it was the univerſal and conſtant practiſe of the Church or no) that is to be the onely rule to judge by in this, or any other controverſies in matters of Religion. But yet admitting for the preſent the rule you ſeem to make, we ſhould deſire to know from you, what that Church Government is, which is ſo conſonant to the will of God and univerſal pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of primitive Churches. For our own parts, we think it will be very hard for you, or any others, to demonſtrate out of any Records of Antiquity, what was the univerſal practiſe of primitive Churches for the whole ſpace of the firſt 300. yeares after Chriſt, or the greateſt part thereof (excepting ſo much as is left upon record in the Scriptures of the new Teſtament) the Monuments of Antiquity, that concern thoſe times (for the greateſt part of them) being both imperfect, and far from ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us, what was the univerſal practiſe of the Church then (though the practiſes of ſome Churches may be mentioned,)
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:119100:55"/>
and likewiſe very queſtionable. At leaſt it will not be eaſie to aſſure us, that ſome of thoſe, that goe under the names of the moſt approved Authors of thoſe times, are neither ſpurious nor corrupted. And hereupon it will unavoidably follow, that we ſhall be left very doubtful, what Government it is, that is moſt conſonant to the univerſal and conſtant practiſe of primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Churches for that time. But as touching the rule it ſelf, which you ſeem here to lay down, we cannot cloſe with it. We do much honour and reverence the Primitive Churches; But yet we believe we owe more reverence to the Scriptures, then to judge them either imperfect, or not to have light enough in themſelves, for the reſolving all doubts touching matters of faith or practiſe, except it be firſt reſolved what was either the concurrent interpretation of the Fathers, or the univerſal and conſtant practiſe of the Churches of thoſe times. Beſides that admitting this for a rule, that the univerſal and conſtant pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of the primitive Churches muſt be that, which muſt aſſure us what is the will of God revealed in Scripture concerning the Government which he hath appointed in the Church, our faith is hereupon reſolved into a moſt uncertain ground, and ſo made fallible and turned into opinion. For what monuments of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, beſides the Scriptures, can aſſure us touching the matters of fact therein contained, that they were ſuch indeed as they are there reported to be? the Authors of them themſelves being men that were not infallibly guided by the Spirit. But yet ſuppoſing we could be infallibly aſſured (which yet never can be) what was the univerſal and conſtant practiſe of the primitive Churches, how ſhall that be a rule to aſſure us, what is moſt conſonant to the will of God? When as we ſee not, eſpecially in ſuch matters, as are not abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation, but that the univerſal practiſe of the Churches might in ſome things be diſſonant to the will of God revealed <note place="margin">Even as a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council it ſelf is ſubject to errour.</note> in Scriptures. And ſo the univerſal practiſe of primitive Churches can be no certain rule to judge by<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is moſt conſonant to the will of God revealed in his Word. We know there are corruptions in the beſt of men: There was ſuch hot contention betwixt <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> as <note place="margin">Gal. 2.</note> cauſed them to part aſunder. <hi>Peter</hi> ſo failed in his practiſe, as
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:119100:55"/>
that though before ſome came from <hi>James,</hi> he did eat with the Gentiles, yet when they were come he withdrew himſelf, fearing them of the Circumciſion. And hereupon not only o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Jews likewiſe diſſembled with him, but <hi>Barnabas</hi> alſo was carried away with their diſſimulation. Whence it's clear, that the examples of the beſt men even in thoſe things, wherein they went contrary to the rule of Gods Word, are of a ſpreading nature, and the better the Perſons, that give the bad exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, are, the greater the danger of the more univerſal lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening. Nay we finde, that not onely ſome few Apoſtolical men had their failings, but even Apoſtolical primitive Churches did, in the very face of the Apoſtles (they being yet alive) make great defection, both in regard of opinions and practiſes. As from the examples of the Churches of <hi>Corinth, Galatia,</hi> and the Churches of <hi>Aſia</hi> is manifeſt. The Apoſtle alſo tels us, that even in his time, the myſtery of iniquity began to work: And in after times we know, how the Doctrine was corrupted: what groſſe ſuperſtition crept into the Church: what domination was ſtriven for amongſt the Paſtors and Biſhops of the Churches; till at length Antichriſt was got up into his ſeat, unto which height yet he came not all at once, but by ſteps, and degrees. Beſides it is of freſh remembrance, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the reformation happily brought about in our own Church in regard of Doctrine and worſhip, after thoſe diſmal <hi>Marian</hi> times, yet the corruption, in regard of Government, continued ſuch, during the time of the late Prelacy (which yet was taken away in other reformed Churches) that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors were deprived of that power of rule, that our Church acknowledgeth did belong to them of right; and which did anciently belong to them; however the exerciſe thereof did after grow into a long diſuſe, as hath been ſhewed before. And therefore when we conſider on the one hand, that the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority, which the Biſhop obtained at the firſt above the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter in the ancient Church (and which was rather obtained <hi>conſue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>udine Eccleſiae</hi> then by Divine right) did at the length grow to that height, that the Paſtors were ſpoiled of all power of rule: ſo we cannot much wonder on the other hand, that the ruling Elder was quite turned out of doors; For the proof
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:119100:56"/>
of the being and exerciſe of whoſe office in the purer times, there are notwithſtanding produced teſtimonies of the ancients, by Divines both at home and abroad, that have written about that ſubject, and to which we do therein refer you: As there doe remain ſome footſteps and ſhadow of their office in the Church-wardens and Sides-men even to this day. And ſo upon the whole, the premiſſes conſidered, and that we are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not to follow a multitude to do evil (though it were of the beſt of men) and that therefore the examples and practiſes, though it were of whole Churches, are to be no further a rule for us, then they follow Chriſt, and as their examples be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of in the Word of Chriſt, notwithſtanding the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fality and long continuedneſſe of ſuch practiſes; Whereas you ſay, <hi>that you pray for the eſtabliſhment of ſuch Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as is conſonant to the will of God and univerſal practiſe of primitive Churches;</hi> we believe you might cut the matter a great deal ſhorter, and ſay, That you are for the eſtabliſhing of that Government, that is moſt conſonant to the will of God revealed in the Scriptures, and that the Word of God alone (and on which onely Faith muſt be built, and into which at laſt be reſolved, when other records of Antiquity, that yet are not ſo ancient, as it is, have been ſearcht into never ſo much) ſhall determine what that is, and ſo thoſe weariſome and endleſſe diſputes, about what is the univerſal and conſtant practiſe of primitive Churches (and which if it could be found out in any good meaſure of probability for the firſt 300. years after Chriſt, could never yet be ſo farre iſſued, as to be a ſure bottom, whereon our faith may ſafely reſt) may be cut off. It being a moſt certain rule, and eſpecially in matters of faith, that the <hi>Factum</hi> is not to preſcribe againſt the <hi>Jus;</hi> The <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice</hi> againſt the <hi>Right</hi> or what ought to be done. And it being out of all queſtion the ſafeſt courſe for all, to bring all doctrines and practices to the ſure and infallible Standard and Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, the Word of God alone. And after you have more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly weighed the matter, and remember how you profeſſe, that in the matters you propoſe in your P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:119100:56"/>
ſo fully warranted by the Word of God, as well as by the conſtant practice of the Catholick Church;</hi> (although what that was, were more likely to be reſolved by a general Council then by your ſelves) the propoſal of having the Word of God alone to be the Judge of the Controverſie about Church Government, cannot (we think) in reaſon be deny'd by you.</p>
                  <p>And we with you ſhall heartily pray, That, that Church-Government, which is moſt conſonant to the will of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in Scriptures, might be eſtabliſhed in theſe Lands. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we muſt alſo profeſſe, that we believe, that that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which is eſtabliſhed by Authority, and which we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, is, for the ſubſtantials of it, this Government, and which we judge alſo to be moſt conſonant to the practice of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Churches in the pureſt times. And therefore as there was ſome entrance made by the late Parliament, in regard of eſtabliſhing this Government by ordinances, as the Church Government of theſe Nations: And as to the putting thoſe Ordinances in execution, there hath been ſome beginning in the Province of <hi>London,</hi> the Province of this County, and in ſome other places throughout the Land: So when there ſhall be the opportunity offered, we ſhall not be wanting by petitioning or otherwayes to uſe our beſt endeavours, that it may be fully ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled throughout theſe Lands; that ſo we may not, as to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in the Church, any longer continue as a City without wals, and a Vineyard without an hedge, and ſo (to the undoing of our poſterity) endanger Religion to be quite loſt. And up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which conſideration we do earneſtly deſire, that all conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious and moderate ſpirited men throughout the Land, though of different principles, whether of the Epiſcopal or Congregational way, would bend themſelves ſo far as poſſibly they can to accommodate with us in point of practice: In which there was ſo good a progreſſe made by the late Aſſembly, as to thoſe that were for the Congregational way: And, as we think, alſo all thoſe that were for the lawfulneſſe of ſubmiſſion to the Government of the late Prelacy, as it was then exerciſed, and that are of the Judgement of the late Primate of <hi>Ireland</hi> in his reduction of Epiſcopacy unto the form of Synodical Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (mentioned before) might doe, if they would come up
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:119100:57"/>
towards us ſo far, as we judge their principles would allow them, As we do alſo profeſſe, that however we cannot conſent to part with the Ruling Elder, unleſſe we ſhould betray the truth of Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. (as we judge) and dare not give any like conſent to admit of a moderate E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopacy, for fear of encroachments upon the Paſtors right, and whereof late ſad experience leſſons us to beware, as we judge alſo, that the ſuperiority of a Biſhop above a Presbyter in degree (which ſome maintain) is no Apoſtolical inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſo have the greater reaſon in that reſpect to caution againſt it: Yet we do here profeſſe, we ſhould ſo farre, as will conſiſt with our principles and the peace of our own conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, be ready to abate or tolerate much for peace ſake. That ſo at the length all parties throughout the Land, that have any ſoundneſs in them in matters of faith, and that are ſober and godly, though of different judgements in leſſer matters, being weary of their diviſions, might fall in the necks one of another with mutual embraces and kiſſes, and ſo at laſt (through the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der mercy of our God) there might be an happy cloſure of breaches, and reſtoring of peace and union in this poor, unſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled, rent, and diſtracted Church, to the glory of God through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the Churches.</p>

                  <p>BUt now as to you, and what follows in your Paper, (and in the mean ſeaſon, till this can be accompliſhed, and for which we ſhall heartily pray) we cannot but judge, that ſuch as are within our bounds, <hi>and live as lawleſſe perſons contemning the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God, and ſo out of their rank and order,</hi> (and of which ſort you deny not, but that there may be ſome among us, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they be ſubject to Law, and the puniſhment of the Civil Sword, as needs they muſt be) yet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being ſuch as are juſtly cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; according to the rules of our Government, we do not think they are thereby exempted from being reached by that

                     <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Sword,</hi> as you phraſe it, which both God and the Civil Authority hath intruſted us with.</p>
                  <p>And as we are farre from contemning the Authority of the Civil Magiſtrate, and ſhall therefore (out of due reſpect unto it, and that the lawleſſe might be curbed) be ready, not onely our ſelves, as we have a call; but alſo warn others, as there may be occaſion, to make complaint to the Civil Power, that ſo ſuch offenders, may be puniſhed by corporal and pecuniary mulcts, to the ſuppreſſion of wickedneſſe and licentiouſneſſe, and the <hi>Reformation of mens lives and manners;</hi> Yet we do not apprehend why this ſhould hinder us from <hi>warning the Members of our ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Congregations to make complaint to the Elderſhip of thoſe, that walk diſorderly and will not be reclaimed, to the end they may be further dealt with, as the nature of their offence may deſerve.</hi> We being fully aſſured from the word of truth, That Excommunication is Gods ordinance, appointed for the reformation of the ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and as you your ſelves acknowledged in the beginning of your Paper: and being a ſpiritual puniſhment for the nature and kind of it, through the bleſſing of God, may be more avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for the deſtruction of the fleſh, and the thorough humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the offender, then any corporal or pecuniary mulct (that reaches but the outward man) can be; And as it was bleſſed with great ſucceſſe for this end for many years together, whileſt the Church was deſtitute of Chriſtian Magiſtrates: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in a Chriſtian State we ſee not, why we ſhould divide what God hath joyned together.

                  <p>BUt you ſay, <hi>There are other parts of our Paper, that do likewiſe remain dark, which you deſire to be made plain.</hi> Although we conceive not ſo of them, yet we ſhall as willingly go along with you, to give you further anſwer, as you to deſire the ſame of us.</p>
                  <p>And therefore whereas we having ſaid in our Paper, <hi>That there are many perſons of all ſorts, that will not ſubmit themſelves to the preſent Government of the Church;</hi> Your firſt Quaere there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon is, <hi>Why Government in ſingulari?</hi> We anſwer, becauſe it is the onely Government, that at preſent is eſtabliſhed in this Church by Civil Authority; The Prelatical being put down, and cautioned againſt in the humble Advice, in regard of any liberty to be extended to it for the exerciſe thereof: And there being no other Government but the Presbyterian (which is our Government) that is owned (as the Church-Government for the whole Nation) by the Civil Authority. And as it is that, which we judge to be moſt agreeable to the will of God, ſo alſo we conceive, that whatever is of Chriſts preſcribing in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther different Government (whether Epiſcopal or Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional) is to be found here: As we do apprehend the redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancies of them both, to be taken away in this, and the defects of them both, to be here ſupplyed. And however there may be differences amongſt godly men concerning Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which it is that Chriſt <hi>in particulari</hi> hath preſcribed in his Word, yet we judge that the Government which Chriſt hath preſcribed in his Word is but one; As all thoſe muſt ſay ſo too, that not being Eraſtians do hold, That one Church-Government or other is of divine Right.</p>
                  <p>But whereas you bring in <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaying, <hi>Seimus enim unicuique Eccleſiae, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this we ſay; The circumſtantials of Government, that are but matters of order onely, and which muſt be ſuited to the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:119100:58"/>
time, or place, or perſons, for whom they are made, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which (if you had quoted the place where <hi>Calvin</hi> uſeth theſe words) we believe it would appear he ſpeaks; theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing variable, and ſo but the accidentals of Government, may not be one and the ſame in all Churches. But if Chriſt have preſcribed a Government in his word; for the ſubſtantials of it, it muſt needs be <hi>de jure</hi> one and the ſame in every Church. And that the Presbyterian Government is that in particular, which is there preſcribed, in <hi>Calvins</hi> Judgement, is ſo manifeſt by his works to the whole Chriſtian world, that it needs no proof. But if the Government, which Chriſt hath preſcribed, for the ſubſtantials of it be onely one, then that alone is good, and all other Governments differing ſubſtantially from it muſt needs be bad; and this onely <hi>jure divino,</hi> and Chriſts own Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the reſt not.</p>
                  <p>And therefore, whereas in the next place you ſuppoſe, <hi>We may aſſert, that our Government, is the Government by way of Eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, as Chriſts own Government, more immediately, and</hi> jure divino. To this and to what you further hereupon do inquire, we ſay, we have declared already: That we call'd it the preſent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, becauſe it is the onely Government ſettled in the Church by the Civil Power. But whether it be the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by way of Eminency and <hi>jure divino,</hi> that was not the thing referred unto in the phraſe we uſed. And as to the reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of your doubts and ſcruples, we conceive it is not here material for us to go about the proving of the <hi>Jus divinum</hi> of it; we having proved, That it is the Government that is eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by the Civil Magiſttate, and which doth lay as good a foundation to evidence the lawfulneſſe of your ſubmiſſion to it, as for the lawfulneſſe of your ſubmiſſion to the former Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, (and touching which we ſuppoſe you were ſatisfied) your exceptions lying as much againſt the High-Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, Chancellors, and Commiſſaries then, as they can do now againſt the office of Ruling Elders, and which is the chief thing we apprehend is ſtumbled at in our Government.</p>
                  <p>But yet if you deſire to have ſatisfaction given you touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which we are not aſhamed to profeſſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Jus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinum</hi> of the Presbyterian Government, we referee you to what

                  <p>And yet we do not ſay, That there is no preſent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in any Church or Aſſembly of Saints, but where our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline and Government is erected intirely in all the parts of it, no more then we ſhould deny him to be a man, in whom there were a defect of ſome integral parts, or in whom there were ſome ſuperfluous members. But as when Antichriſtianiſme ſo overſpead the face of the Church in thoſe dark times before the Reformation, God preſerved a Church Miniſtery and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, though not without the mixture of many corruptions in doctrine and worſhip, even amongſt the Papiſts themſelves; So there was ſome of Chriſts Government and Diſcipline in the worſt times, though not intirely, nor without the mixture of much corruption in that Diſcipline and Government. And yet if you conſult Antiquity, you will not finde, that the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian Government hath lyen hid ſo long, as that for the ſpace of 1500 years it could never be found till this preſent. You have heard what rule did anciently belong to Presbyters, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that through the corruptions, that crept into the Church in after times, the exerciſe of that power was long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſed.

But it is what <hi>de jure</hi> ought to be, and not what <hi>de facto</hi> is or hath been, which is that, which you and we are chiefly to attend, and concerning which the Scripture muſt be the onely Judge, as we have ſaid before.</p>
                  <p>But you ſay, now ſubjection to our preſent Government is required by us; and then demand, <hi>Whether all that obſerve not our rank and order, and ſubject not themſelves to our preſent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, must be taken for lawleſſe perſons? for ſo,</hi> ſay you, <hi>doth this cloſe connexion of ours ſeem to import;</hi> viz <hi>Many who do not ſubject, but live, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>BUt you ſay, <hi>When we make it an order that notice ſhall be taken of all perſons, that forſake the publik Aſſemblies of the Saints, you would gladly know, how farr we extend this Saintſhip, this Church, and Aſſembly of Saints?</hi>

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:119100:60"/>
In the Churches of <hi>Galatia,</hi> ſuch as mixed works with Faith in the point of Juſtification, and of which the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> would have thoſe Churches to take notice, even to the cenſuring of them, they being ſpots to thoſe Aſſemblies; and however Saints by profeſſion, and in regard of outward calling, being in Covenant with God, and having been baptized, yet an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered not their profeſſion by ſuitable converſation. And therefore, however there be ſundry of the like ſtamp in our Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, we do not therefore unchurch them, or make our Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies not the Aſſemblies of the Saints, becauſe of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of ſuch members.</p>
                  <p>And ſeeing our principles and practiſes are manifeſtly known to be utterly againſt the opinions and practiſes of the Donatiſts of old, and thoſe that have of late rent themſelves from our Churches, becauſe of the ſcandalouſneſſe of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt members, that are found in them, (though the ſin of theſe in our Churches is aggravated by giving that occaſion) you might well have ſpared your pains in tranſcribing out of <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine,</hi> what he juſtly ſaid unto thoſe ſchiſmaticks, that he had to deal with. Nay, you might rather have gathered from our Paper; That ſeeing we ſaid, that notice ſhould be taken of all thoſe that ſhould forſake the publick Aſſemblies of the Saints, our purpoſe was to have cenſured ſuch as the Donatiſts were; That we purpoſed to obſerve and cenſure thoſe that did main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and hold up private meetings in oppoſition to the publick; That cry down our Churches and publick Aſſemblies, Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Ordinances, (as you know ſeveral forts do) and who, as they hold ſundry groſſe errors, that ſubvert the faith, ſo in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of thoſe and other their practiſes, that in their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doe manifeſtly ſubvert the order, unity, and peace, that Chriſt hath eſtabliſhed in his Church, doe juſtly fall under Church cenſure, according to the rules of our Government above mentioned. And that therefore we were not altogether ſilent concerning either the ſin or puniſhment of ſuch, as did erre groſly in doctrinals or in diſcipline, ſo as to make ſuch dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous rents from the Church, as the fore-named Sectaries do: Contrary to what you ſay of us in your Paper. And further, by ſuch as forſake the publick Aſſemblies of the Saints, of whom
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:119100:60"/>
we ſaid notice ſhould be taken, you might have gathered our meaning was, that ſuch (of which ſort there are but too many amongſt us) who out of a principle of careleſneſs, ſloth, worldli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or manifeſt prophaneneſs, do on the Lords day either idle out the time, or elſe are worſe imployed, when they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort to the publick Aſſemblies (and who, as they are no friends to any private meetings for the good of their ſouls, in the uſe of any private means of conference or prayer for that end; So they doe alſo Atheiſtically turn their backs on all the publick Ordinances, forſaking them and the Aſſemblies, where theſe are diſpenſed) ſhould be taken notice of in order to cenſure, if there was not reformation; and to neither of which ſort of perſons any indulgence is granted by any Laws of the Land, that we know of. And if you had gathered thus much from our Paper, as your miſtake had been far the leſſe, ſo your Charity had been the more, then to have reckoned us in the number of ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> were. And yet we did not mean, That we intended to take notice in order unto cenſure of ſuch, who being ſound in the faith, and godly in life (though differing from us in point of Diſcipline and Government) had their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Aſſemblies from ours, they indeavouring to keep the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Spirit in the bond of Peace: They not being cenſura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by the rules of our Government, as is manifeſt, by what we have declared before. Although we remember, how all that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted not to the former Government, were counted ſchiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical. Neither did we reckon theſe in the number of the lawleſs Perſons, we ſpeak of, who ſubjected not themſelves to our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and whom we account to be parts of the univerſal viſible Church militant here on earth, however they have alſo their publique Aſſemblies diſtinct from ours, though ſundry of them, as there is occaſion, reſort to ours alſo. But how we ſhould hereupon make either theſe or the lawleſs Perſons, that we ſpeak of, members of the inviſible Triumphant Church (all which we have reckoned to belong to the viſible) they muſt have eyes quicker then Eagles, that can diſcern how this follows, and therefore there is no fear our Charity ſhould ſo far over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reach, as you ſuppoſed it might.</p>
                  <p>But ſtill you are unſatisfied; For you know not, it ſeems,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:119100:61"/>
what we mean by the word <hi>(Publique) the publique Aſſemblies of the Saints.</hi> By our profeſſions and practiſes in our owning the Publique Aſſemblies, where the publique Ordinances of the word Sacraments, and Prayer are diſpenſed, which we our ſelves do conſtantly frequent and ſtir up others to fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent alſo, it was plain enough, what we meant by publique Aſſemblies. And we are heartily ſorry, that you underſtanding our meaning, as is clear by what you ſay anon, ſhould by this but make your way to give a laſh at our <hi>private meetings,</hi> which are none of them ſuch, as we need to be aſhamed of. And which, when we meet, either for conference about matters of Religion, or to pray together, and humble our ſelves for our own ſins and the ſins of theſe times; when there is not the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of a publique Aſſemby; or when perſonal or Family occaſions call for a private, is ſurely as commendable, at the leaſt, as a private meeting upon domeſtical, civil, or political occaſions: and therefore not to be ſecretly girded at: As on the other hand, we do not meddle with the cenſuring of thoſe who being godly and ſound in the faith, in the main points of Relegion, do yet differ from us in iudgement, in matters of Diſcipline and Government and have their Aſſemblies for Gods publique worſhip diſtinct from ours, as we are barred from it by the rules of our Government, as we have often ſaid before. And therefore we leave room enough for Conſciences that are truely tender. Though we cannot ſay ſo much for the Prelatical Government</p>
                  <p>Neither do we tranſgreſs any Laws of the Land, which have made no proviſion to except any perſons, that we meddle with, and are made cenſurable by the rules laid down in the from of Church Government: nor have we <hi>under Colour of Authority made any Laws and Edicts;</hi> but according to that power, that the civil Authority hath committed to us, have only openly given notice in our ſeveral Congregations, of what offences are cenſurable by the rules of our Government, that the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders might take heed, they incurre not that cenſure of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication which Authority hath awarranted us to inflict upon the obſtinate and otherwiſe incorrigible. And therefore (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept to execute what we are appointed to do by the civil power
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:119100:61"/>
be to contemn it) we cannot be thought to have done any thing in contempt of the civil power, as it is not our ignorance of the Laws in force (that, we are confident, being grounded in reaſon, fight not one aganſt another, and which is your more charitable and favorable conſtruction) that hath led us into any practiſes, that are tranſgreſſions of them. And therfore though you much queſtion (upon what account ſoever it be that we have been led into what we have acted) and think it concernes us to look to it, <hi>whether we have not run our ſelves</hi> into a premunire: Yet we are aſſured, we are as ſufficiently ſecured againſt that danger, as all the Iuſtices in the Land are, that have acted upon other Ordinances of Parliament, which they have judged to be in force, as we do alſo thoſe to be, that have been the ground of our proceedings.</p>

Do not think, that in this we are any more to be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by you (we uſing variety of expreſſions onely for this end, that we might be better underſtood then we blame Lawyers and Attorneys, (and wherein we judge them not tolbe blame worthy) for uſing variety of expreſſions and Multiplicity of <hi>Synonymous</hi> Words to make the matter more clear and out of doubt, where yet one and the ſame thing is underſtood by all.</p>

                  <p>You ſay; <hi>After the ſecond and third Orders againſt thoſe, that forſake the publique Aſſemblies of the Saints and ſuch as are ſcandalous, comes in a fourth touching the Catechumeni in the firſt Order mentioned,</hi> viz <hi>That the Miniſter, when he Catechizeth the ſeverall Families,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>But here in the firſt place we obſerve, you omit to mention the firſt part of this Order, and unto which, that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows in the two next Orders, doth refer. And in the next

place you deſcant upon this latter branch of it only. For you ſay, <hi>But what if they will not preſent themſelves before the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſhip; The Miniſter muſt exhort and admoniſh them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But that is wholly of your own adding. Yet you go on and ſay, <hi>But what if they ſtill refuſe; their names ſhall be publiſhed openly in the ſeveral Congregations, and they warned before all to reform.</hi> So you affirm that we ſay, though you prove it not, as we ſhall ſhew you anon. But here you call for attention and ſay. <hi>Mark; Men of blameleſs life and knowledge muſt be warned before all to reform.</hi> If we either had practiſed any ſuch thing, or any ſuch conſtruction, either from the rules of Grammer or Logick, or common reaſon, could have been put upon the words, we uſed in our Paper, you might have called for this attention, that ſo ſuch a Government as this, and the Perſons mannaging it, might have been caſt out both together, and no where tolerated in the Chriſtian World. Although we have not forgotten the time, when under the late Prelacy, many godly and orthodox Miniſters, and ſundry knowing and conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions Chriſtians, were far worſe uſed, then to have onely their names publiſhed in the Congregations, and they warned to conform to the orders then appointed in the Church.

                     <pb n="60" facs="tcp:119100:63"/>
But yet you go on further ſtill and ſay. <hi>But what if after all this thay will not reform, but continue obſtinate; Then,</hi> ſay you, <hi>no admiſſion to the Sacrament, for that, you ſay, is implyed in the fourth order; and that here is our</hi> Excommunicatio minor. But yet you drive on your charge higher ſtill; for you adde. <hi>But that is not all, an higher cenſure yet, They ſhall be caſt out and excommunicate.</hi> For ſo, ſay you, <hi>ſaith the ſixth and laſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the great Excommunication, which caſteth out of the Church alſo, and judgeth them no better then Heathens and Publicans, notwithſtanding all their piety and knowledge.</hi> And when you have driven up your charge to the height, you conclude and tell us, what the upſhot of our reſolves comes to, which is this, as you ſay, <hi>viz. In brief all willfully ignorant</hi> (though we ſpeak not one tittle of their cenſure at all) <hi>and ſcandalous are to be Excommunicate, and not onely they, but the knowing and blameleſs of life alſo, if they perſent not themſelves to the Elderſhip.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But here we ſee, partly prejudice againſt the Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and Perſons preſenting themſelves before it, in order to their Admiſſion to the Sacrament; and partly your unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintedneſs with the Rules of the Presbyterian Government, hath impoſed upon you, thus far, as to force upon us, ſuch a conſtruction of our words, as never came into our own thoughts. It was an exhortation onely, that was appointed to be given to the Perſons Catechized to preſent themſelves to the Elderſhip, and no more. Not ſo much as an Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition in order to any further cenſure in caſe not hearkened unto. And here we obſerve that this is one main ground of your miſtake, that you do not diſtinguiſh betwixt an Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is in order to a further cenſure, if it prevaile not (and which was mentioned in the firſt part of the fourth Order, and which you wholly omit) and an exhortation; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found theſe together, taking them for one and the ſame, and which is here a radical and grand miſtake. For doubtleſs in a thouſand caſes, that might be inſtanced in, there may be place for an exhortation, when though ineffectual, there is no place, for an Admonition, that is in order to a further Church cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in caſe of obſtinacy, as it is taken by us here. Men may
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:119100:63"/>
be exhorted to examine and prove themſelvs, whether they be in the faith: to ſelf examination before they come to the Lords Table: to grow in Grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Ieſus Chriſt: to keep their hearts with all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, and to infinite more things of the like nature, &amp; which are duties, they ſhould apply themſelves unto; When yet there is no room for an admonition, in oder to any Church cenſure, in caſe it be not obeyed. Nay, when men may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, there is not that care that ſhould be in Perſons, in regard of ſome of their Words and carriages, there may be place for an exhortation, and yet for no Admonition in order to any Church cenſure, in caſe the exhortation be not hearkned unto: if there be not any further ſcandalous out breakings of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that may juſtly merit it. <hi>Church cenſures are not to paſs upon men for every fault; nor againſt ſuch as be guilty of ſuch ſins of infirmity, as are commonly found in the Children of God.</hi> As in that caſe by the rules of our Government it is provided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt. And yet an exhortation to watchfullneſs and vigilancy in ſuch caſes is not uſeleſs. And ſo it may well be appointed by us, that the Miniſter ſhould exhort ſuch, as are found by him to be Perſons of knowledge, and are in converſation blameleſs, to preſent themſelves to the Elderſhip, that ſo they might be regularly and orderly admitted to the Sacrament of the Lords Supper (an Ordinance that is not to be ſleighted, as it is by many, but upon too ſleight grounds, as they will be found to be, when they come to be tried in the day of account) and yet no proceedings by Church cenſures againſt ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, in caſe ſuch an exhortation prevaile not. And, but that we ſee you are poſſeſſed with too much perjudice againſt the Elderſhip, we ſhould much have wondred; that you, (who in the beginning of your Paper tell us, you had ſeriouſly weighed ours) ſhould here in the cloſe have run into ſuch a great miſtake, as not to have diſtinguiſhed betwixt the Perſons, that were to be admoniſhed in order to further cenſure, if they hearkened not thereunto, and the Perſons that were to be exhorted onely. If that, which led you into this miſtake, was the conſideration, that they were both joyned together in the ſame order, and therefore were both to be dealt with after the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:119100:64"/>
ſame manner, your argument was very weak, there being nothing more frequent in Scripture and all other Authors, then to couple together in one and the ſame verſe and ſentence things of a different nature. But if that had been your ground of doubting, yet if you had attended to what preſently fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, there had been no place for ſtumbling in ſo plaine a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For that which follows is ſo limited, that it could not with any colour be applyed to thoſe, that being exhorted by the Miniſter to preſent themſelves to the Elderſhip, ſhould ſtill refuſe. For it ſpeaks expreſſely of ſuch, that ſhould nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hearken to pritate Admonition nor the Admonition of the Elderſhip, that their names ſhould be publiſhed openly in the Congregation, and therefore of thoſe onely, who had been appointed to be admoniſhed according to Chriſts rule, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. in the fourth Order.</p>
                  <p>Now the Perſons, that were to be admoniſhed according to the rule of Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. and ſpoken of in the fourth Order, were onely ſuch, as had been mentioned immediately before, <hi>viz.</hi> Such as ſhould forſake the publique Aſſemblies, and ſuch as were ſcandalous Perſons. But yet to make the matter ſtill more plain, let it be conſidered, that it could not with any ſhew of reaſon be conſtrued to be our meaning; that ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who were found to be of competent knowledge and blameleſs in life, if not harkening to the Miniſter exhorting them to preſent themſelves before the Elderſhip, were to have their names publiſhed; and if ſtill refuſing, then to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated. For the Perſons, that were to be thus dealt with, were to be admoniſhed by the Elderſhid, and reject that admonition, before there were to be thoſe further proceedings. But how could ſuch Perſons, that being exhorted by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to preſent themſelves to the Elderſhip and refuſed to come before them, be admoniſhed by them?</p>
                  <p>But if you ſay, the Perſons, that the Miniſter is to exhort to preſent themſelves before the Elderſhip, are mentioned immediately before this order made touching the publiſhing of mens names, and therefore muſt needs be included in this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and the relative <hi>(they)</hi> be referred to theſe, as well as to the other. This Argument alſo is very weak. For thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:119100:64"/>
you, that are Scholers, do well know; That the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative is often referred to the remoter Antecedent, and muſt be ſo of neceſſity, when the ſubject matter ſpoken of doth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily require it, as in this caſe, it is clear it doth. For the Relative <hi>(They)</hi> in the fifth order is limited to ſuch, as ſhould neither hearken to private Admonition, nor to the Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Elderſhip, and theſe were onely the ſcandalous and the forſakers of poblique Aſſemblies, that were to be admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed according to Chriſts rule, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. and which was that, which was appointed by the former branch of the fourth order.</p>
                  <p>But you will parhaps ſay, if this was our meaning, why is the Miniſters exhorting of knowing and blameleſs Perſons to preſent themſelves before the Elderſhip, mentioned in the ſame order with thoſe, that are to be admoniſhed in order to further cenſure, in caſe the Admonition be not hearkened to, if the ſame rule be not to be held with them, as with the others in caſe of refuſall? To which we ſay; The Admonition ſpoken of in the fourth order (is ſaid expreſſely) ſhould be according to the rule of Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. Now that mentions not onely an Admonition to be given by the Church, when the caſe is brought thither, but alſo an Admonition once or twice by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Perſons. And therefore, as when the fitteſt opportunity is offered to private Perſons to perform this duty of Admonition toward an offending Brother, they are to lay hold upon it and not let it ſlip; ſo we judged it a fit opportunity offered to the Miniſter, when he Catechizeth the Families, to exhort ſuch amongſt them, whom he found to be of competent know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, and were blamleſs in life, to preſent themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Elderſhip in order to their Admiſſion to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And the rather, becauſe haveing the opportunity of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with them at this time, if they had any doubts about this matter, or he ſaw that it was prejudice onely in them againſt the Elders, that hindered them (and as it is in moſt) he might indeavour to remove them. And this might have been eaſily conceived was the reaſon thereof by any, that had but ſeriouſly weighed, what we had expreſſed in our Paper, if there had been that candor, that we could have deſired. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we cannot imagine, what there ſhould be in our Paper,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:119100:65"/>
that ſhould give the leaſt juſt occaſion for ſuch a ſtrange ſenſe as you would herein put upon us. And we hope all indifferent and unprejudiced Perſons will ſay, we have given as little oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion by our Carriages, as there is given by our words. We have ſtudied all wayes of condeſcenſion for the gaining of all: That neither the weak might be diſcoraged, nor any that can with any colour pretend to tenderneſs of Conſcience in the matter of preſenting themſelves before the Elderſhip have any bar put in the way of their Communicating with us at the Lords Table, in regard of that order, that is obſerved for their Admiſſion. But we finde, that the Elderſhip is that great ſtumbling-block with many. And we are ſorry, that we have reaſon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, that; Let, us do what can, yet ſome will be ſatisfied with nothing, but pulling down the hedg, and laying all common. But we dare not thus far ſeek to pleaſe men, though we deſire to pleaſe our neighbour for his good to edification.</p>
                  <p>We have thus far removed all imaginable grounds in our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions for this your groundleſs charge; That our purpoſe was to excommunicate all knowing and blameleſs Perſons, if they preſented not themſelves before the Elderſhip. We ſhall now proceed to examine what you produce for the ſupporting of your ſelves in it. And that, which we finde in the firſt place, is (beſides your omitting to take any notice of the firſt branch of this fourth order) ſomething in your comment upon our words, which was not in our Text. For you ſay; <hi>What, if after the Miniſter hath exhorted them, they ſhall not preſent themſelves before the Elderſhip; The Miniſter,</hi> ſay you <hi>muſt exhort and admoniſh them.</hi> But this, as we have told you, is wholly your own, and none of ours. For firſt, though we do not deny, But that if upon the firſt exhortation they do not preſent themſelves to the Elderſhip (it being in order to their regular and orderly Admiſſion to the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per) the Miniſter may exhort, and exhort them again, becauſe they continue in the neglect of that, which is their duty, yet there was no ſuch thing ſaid by us But then to make the ground of your charge ſomething more colourable, you added ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther word; which was not at all uſed by us. We ſaid the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter was to exhort, and that was all. But you adde and ſay,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:119100:65"/>
                     <hi>He ſhall exhort and admoniſh.</hi> But we have told you before, to exhort and admoniſh are different things. And we leave it to indifferent Judges to conſider, whether this be a candid and fair wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of arguing even in the Schools; much leſſe ſhould it have been made uſe of, when it is brought in to bear up the weight of ſo heavy a charge, as you here put up againſt us. And this is the main foundation, whereupon all the reſt is built. But your ground work being ſo unſure, what you built there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on muſt needs fall. Yet you go on to make it good, as far as you can, and therefore do further add and ſay. <hi>But what, if they ſtill refuſe? Their names,</hi> ſay you, <hi>ſhall be publiſhed,</hi> &amp;c. But what's your proof for this? <hi>That's,</hi> ſay you, <hi>the fifth Order.</hi> But here you quite miſtake your mark, and therefore when you have conſidered it, your ſelves will not wonder, you ſhould ſhoot ſo wide. For the fifth Order ſpeaks only of Perſons, that have been privately admoniſhed, and alſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed by the Elderſhip; Of which the former branch of the fourth order ſpeaks. And what ſort of Perſons that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to, is manifeſt from our Paper, and hath been by us ſhewed before, that it cannot by any good Rules of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction be referred to the Perſons, that the Miniſter is to exhort, and which is the latter branch of the fourth Order. And this link of your chain being thus broken, the reſt of it, which follows, muſt needs of it ſelf fall in ſunder. So that we need to add no more.</p>
                  <p>And ſo we have done with the examination of what you have preſented to us in your Paper.</p>
                  <p>But we do not finde, that you have diſcovered to us any thing in ours, that is not ſound and orthodox; and for which therefore there is any juſt reaſon, why any thing in it ſhould lye ſadly on your ſpirits and conſciences. But do hope, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you have ſeriouſly weighed, what is here preſented, you may receive ſo much ſatisfaction, as to ſee you have no juſt cauſe to forbear joyning with us upon any grounds you have here made known. We have been willing to put our ſelves upon ſome pains in this our large Anſwer; And if it attain the deſired end, we ſhall not account it ill beſtowed. If yet you ſhould reſt unſatisfied, we deſire you to let us know, what it is
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:119100:66"/>
you ſtumble at; And though in regard of ſundry other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, that lye upon us, it cannot be expected, that we, who meet but once a moneth in ordinary, and about other matters, ſhould hold on a courſe of Anſwering you ſtill by writing. Yet we ſhall be ready to appoint, ſome other way (that may be far more ſpeedy, and (we truſt) as effectual) to give you that further ſatisfaction, that is meet and juſt. And now we ſhall intreat, that as our only aime in this Anſer hath not been victory, but the clearing up of the Truth; the ſatisfying your ſcruples, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving you a right underſtanding, in what you were miſtaken, and the vindication of the Government and our ſelves, and hereby the ſetling of Peace and Unity in our Congregations, to the glory of God and edification of the Church: So you would ſhew forth that Candor, as not to put any other conſtruction upon what is here offered to you; And as you ſubſcribe your ſelves our brethren deſirous of Truth, Unity and Peace in the Church; So we ſhall heartily begge of the God of Truth and Peace, that both you and we, may all of us, in all our tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, make it to appear, that we are cordial and real in our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions of ſuch deſires; and that he would bleſs theſe and all other our ſincere endevours, that they may be effectual for the attaining thoſe ends.</p>

               <p>We ſhall make no further Replication to the ſeveral particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars in your Paper, at this time, but only to one Branch, wherein you refer us to Dr. <hi>Bernard.</hi> In the cloſe of whoſe Book, we meet with <note n="*" place="margin">Cl.

                  <hi>one</hi> intituled, <hi>The Reduction of Epiſcopacy unto the form of</hi> Synodical <hi>Government received in the Ancient Church,</hi> By the moſt Reverend and Learned Father of our Church Dr. <hi>James <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> late Archbiſhop of <hi>Armagh,</hi> and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of all <hi>Ireland</hi> propoſed in the year 1641. as an expedient for the prevention of thoſe troubles, which afterwards did ariſe, about the matter of Church Government, which you ſay is the ſame in ſubſtance with yours.</p>
               <p>Your words are theſe, <hi>But if the Antiquity of ſuch Aſſemblies be that you Queſtion, Then we refer you to what Dr.</hi> Bernard <hi>in the Book of his above quoted ſhews, was the judgement of Dr.</hi> Uſher <hi>(who is acknowledged by all that knew him, or are acquainted with his works to have been a great Antiquary (however we alleadge him not, that you ſhould build your faith on his Teſtimony) And which we think, may be ſufficient to vindicate Provinciall Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies in your thoughts from the Suſpicion of Novelty; In that Book you have in the cloſe of it, propoſals touching the Reduction of Epiſcopacy unto the form of</hi> Synodical <hi>Government received in the Ancient Church. And it thus begins, By the order of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſo you go on quoting ſeveral Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Fathers, and Councils there alleadged, In which you further proceed, and ſay; <hi>There are Propoſals of Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of Paſtors within certain limited bounds which ſaving that they are ſomewhat larger then ours, which is but a circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial difference do hold proportion with the Claſſical, Provincial, and National Aſſemblies mentioned in the form of our Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, As alſo the times propounded there for their meetings the power of theſe Aſſemblies,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and are the ſame in ſubſtance as with us. And all theſe were propounded as the way of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in the Ancient Church, and as an Expedient,</hi> &amp;c. as aboveſad.
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:119100:67"/>
                  <hi>And therefore</hi> (for ſo you conclude) <hi>in the Judgement of this learned, and Reverend Antiquary, our Provincial Aſſembly at</hi> Preſton <hi>(where the Paſtors of the Church are members, as he acknowledgeth of right they ought to be in ſuch Aſſemblies) would not have been accounted a new Termed Provincial Aſſembly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Touching all which we ſhall cloſe and joyn iſſue with you: we willingly ſubmit our ſelves to that order, aud rule therein Expreſſed which being that which was received in the Ancient Church, In the Judgement of that Reverend, and learned Antiquary Dr. <hi>

In which wiſh, as we do cordially joyn our ſelves, ſo we heartily deſire that all godly and moderate ſpirited men throughout the Land, would alſo cloſe.</hi> And in another place you ſay, <hi>However we dare not admit of a moderate Epiſcopacy for fear of encroachings upon the Paſtors right,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Yet we do here profeſſe we ſhould ſo far, as will conſiſt with our principles, and the peace of our own Conſciences, be ready to abate or tolerate much for peace ſake; That ſo at the length, all parties throughout the Land, that have any ſoundneſs in them, in matters of faith, and that are ſober and godly, though of different judgements in leſſer matters, being weary of their diviſions, might fall into the necks of one another, with mutual embraces and kiſſes, and ſo at laſt through the tender mercy of our God, there might be an happy cloſure of breaches, and restoring of peace and union in this poor, unſetled, rent, and diſtracted Church, to the glory of God throughout all Churches.</hi>

Now who are they that diſturbe this our happy cloſure and conjunction?

                  </note> thoſe are the <hi>Ruling Elders,</hi> as you call them; We ſuppofe <hi>you mean thoſe</hi> whom you have choſen out of the Laity, and admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <note place="margin">are thoſe.</note> (without further entring into holy Orders) into the whole execiſe of Eccleſiaſtical juriſdiction, in equal right with the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters</hi> of the Goſpel, (in which reſpect your Aſſemblies, and <note place="margin">any Miniſter.</note> ſo your Provincial at <hi>Preſton</hi> would be accounted in the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Dr. <hi>

               <p>Now whereas you ſay you cannot part with them unleſs you betray the Truth of Chriſt (as you judge.) By this Parentheſis, we gather, that you are not ſo wedded to that opinion but you can, and will ſubmit to better reaſon, when offered to you; And we do again profeſs to you, that we will not willfully, and perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naciouſly, hold a contrary Tenent. And in this confidence we proceed to ſhew to you, that Lay-Elders are not meant nor mentioned in thoſe Texts by you alledged; Briefly thus, but more largely hereafter, if what is comprehended in this paper be not judged ſatisfactory.</p>
               <p>Run over all the Expoſiters of holy writ, whether the Fathers in general, or more particular Councils (And <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith there can be no better, nor ſurer remedy for deciding ofcontroverſies, no better ſenſe, nor Interpretation of Scripture, then what is given by them in ſuch Councils) or whether the Fathers apart.

                  </note> one Father in their Comments upon them giveth ſuch a ſenſe. Finde one Expoſition for you and (which is much) we will yield you all.</p>
               <p>Many there are that apply them to the Biſhops. And ſo one for thoſe many of our Modern Doctors we could give you (to anſwer thoſe modern you quote in behalf of your Elders) of our Engliſh Church, Dr. <hi>Fulk</hi> by name we inſtance in, applying theſe Texts to the Biſhops only, whom we quote in regard of the moderate judgement he was ſuppoſed to be of, in point of Church-government, and therefore more likely to ſway with you than any other we could produce; His words are theſe: <hi>Amongſt the Clergy, for Order, and Government, there was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes one principal, to whom by long uſe of the Church, the name of Biſhop or Super-intendent hath been applyed, which in Scripture is called</hi>

               <p>And therefore it can be no betraying of the Truth of Chriſt, if you will ſeriouſly weigh it in the ballance of impartial and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudicate reaſon, to part with them, and to take in the other, but a ſtrengthening, and a backing of it. Wherefore in the name of God, and in the tender bowels of Chriſt, we beg again and again, beſeeching you not to ſtand upon circumſtantials or private intereſts, But to apply your ſelves to this happy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture and reconcilement of ſo many poor Chriſtian Souls, in truth, love, and peace, in this our Engliſh Church, in theſe our days; The bleſſing that may redound to all parties thus recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled is unconceiveable; The lives and manners of diſſolute perſons (and how many there are amongſt our ſelves, of that ſort, we are but too too conſcious) may by this loving accord, with brotherly admonition and exhortation be reclaimed, or by due cenſures corrected and amended.

For however we do not queſtion but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent and judicious Reader, by comparing only what is ſaid on both ſides, will of himſelf eaſily perceive, that neither in this, nor your third Paper, you do tender any thing, that can have any ſhew of ſatisfactorineſs, unto the anſwer we gave you yet leaſt the weak ſhould be impoſed on, by your bold and confident aſſertions, your ſcoffes and taunts at our anſwer) as generally weak, and in ſome places abſurd, and thereby to the prejudice of the truth, and cauſe we ſtand for, be induced to conceive (if we ſhould not return ſome further anſwer) you had put us to ſilence, and we had nothing father to ſay: in the midſt of ſundry other of our miniſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all occaſions, we are willing to be at ſome further pains, for the ſatisfaction of ſuch, as alſo for the vindication of the truth, the Presbyterian Government, and our ſelves and actings, from the many unjuſt aſperſions, that are caſt upon us in your papers; hoping alſo that the Reader will conſider, that if our anſwer to theſe your two other papers be ſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, it comes out ſoon enough from us, who are a ſociety, and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:119100:71"/>
many, and muſt therefore on that account move the more ſlowly, though (we hope) not the leſs ſurely, and who beſides the inſpection over our families and congregations and our conſtant and dayly pains amongſt them, have other matters alſo of publique and common concernment to the whole Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation, to attend on at our Claſſical meetings, and which we could not think, were fit to be wholly laid aſide, or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, that ſo our anſwer might be haſtened to what you have printed, we having juſt cauſe to fear, leaſt, when we have ſaid that, which will be ſufficient to ſatisfie the unprejudiced Reader, you will not therein acquieſce. But we now come to your Papers, and ſhall firſt anſwer to your Second, and then Animadvert on your laſt.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of your ſecond paper, to which we now anſwer, (though you here cauſeleſly complain of our prolixity) <q>yet you court us with the ſweeteſt compellations, calling us, Your dear Friends (nay more) Brethren dearly beloved to you in the Lord, and further you return us hearty thanks for our anſwer, which you acknowledge is full of civility toward you;</q> but in your third and laſt paper, you fall on us with ſcoffs, and jeires, uncharitable cenſures, foul aſperſions pouring out that too much venom and diſtemper of ſpirit, which the godly and wiſe Readers will ſoon be aware of, and which whether they be agreeable to thoſe ſugared words you here give us, we leave it to your ſelves in the ſearching of your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences to judge of; as we doubt not, but when the impartial Reader ſhall compare the civility of our anſwer, with what he may finde in your firſt paper, he will readily conclude, we merited no ſuch things from you as we meet with in your laſt.</p>
               <p>But we do here obſerve, that you do not deny, but that <q>there might be ſome errors, and miſtakes, and ſome ſharpe reflections upon us, and our government, in that firſt paper, and with which we had charged you;</q> And hereupon we have reaſon to tell you, that you had evidenced more ſincerity in this confeſſion, if the ſence of your former failings, had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held you from running into the like and worſe again; as
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:119100:72"/>
had there not been a further diſcovery of the diſtemper of your ſpirit, we ſhould have been <hi>willing to have paſſed them over, and covered them in love,</hi> upon this confeſſion, according to that hope thereof, which you do here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>And as touching the impertinencies, errors, and miſtakes, which (you ſay) not improbably might be diſcovered in ours, and which here you forbear to minde us of;</q> in your next paper you ſpeak out, what here might be in your thoughts, and which we ſhall forbear to return any anſwer to, untill we come thither. But thus are we brought to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this Paper. And here the Reader will perceive, that the main thing you do pitch upon in the firſt place, is what we had quoted out of Dr. <hi>Bernard,</hi> ſhowing the judgement of Dr. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> concerning the antiquity of the Aſſemblies he mentions, and particularly of Provincial, and which the Reader may ſee more at large, if he be pleaſed to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe the third Section of our anſwer toward the latter end of it.</p>
               <p>

Unto all which we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ave ſeveral and ſundry things to ſay.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) And firſt we deſire, it might here be took notice of, what order and rule it is, that is propounded by Dr. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> in his reduction of <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> to the form of Synodical Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, received in the ancient Church; it is Epiſcopacy ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing moderated and limited, it being there propounded. <q>That in every Pariſh the Rector, or incumbent Paſtor toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Churchwardens and Sideſmen, may every week take notice of ſuch as live ſcandalouſly in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation who are to receive ſuch ſeveral admonitions and reproofes, as the quality of their offence ſhall deſerve; and if by this means they cannot be reclaimed, they may be preſented to the next monthly Synod, and in the mean time, be debarred by the Paſtor from acceſſe unto the Lords Table; as is evident from the firſt propoſal. And he then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds, that the Suffragans in the ſeveral rural Deaneries ſupplying the place of thoſe, who in the ancient Church were called <hi>Chorepiſcopi</hi> might every moneth aſſemble a Synod of all the Rectors, or incumbent Paſtors within the Precinct, and according to the major part of their voices, conclude all matters that ſhall be brought into debate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, as is manifeſt from the ſecond Propoſal. And then further it is propoſed that the Dioceſan Synod might be held once or twice in the year, as it ſhould be thought moſt convenient, and that therein all the Suffragans and the reſt of the Rectors or incumbent Paſtors (or a certain ſelect number of every Deanery) within the Dioceſs might meet, or with whoſe conſent or the major part of them, all things might be concluded by the Biſhop or Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is the ſum of the third Propoſall. The like is propounded for the Provincial and National Synods, ſaving that here all the Biſhops and Suffragans of every Dioceſs are to be members in theſe Aſſemblies, and only ſuch of the Clergy as ſhould be elected, and the Archbiſhops to be the Moderators of theſe Aſſemblies,</q> as is clear from the fourth Propoſal.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:119100:73"/>
Now this is that Order and rule, that you do here profeſſe your ſelves willing to ſubmit unto. And therefore you would conſent; that ſome Miniſters at the leaſt, might for the preſent, have ſome power in the governing of the Church: but whether you would by theſe propoſals, take your ſelves obliged, to ſubmit to be governed, by all the Miniſters placed in Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels, throughout the ſeveral Pariſhes (that yet for ſure are equall to the reſt of their fellow Presbyters in order and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction) or only to thoſe that are benefic'd men (as they were wont to be called) we do much queſtion; and whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>her you would conſent, that any other ſhould vote in any of the fore mentioned Aſſemblies, we do alſo doubt; as we have alſo reaſon, from what you expreſſe in your next paper, to fear, you would but conſent only thus far, becauſe you may perceive, by theſe propoſals (where the Suffragans, Biſhops, and Archbiſhops are to be conſtant Moderators in the Aſſemblies mentioned, and without whom (as we appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend) you will underſtand them, nothing might paſſe and be concluded, notwithſtanding what was concluded, ſhould be done by the major part of the incumbent Paſtors, or Rectors preſent; and when in the Dioceſan Synod, all the Suffragans muſt be members, and in the Provincial and Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal, all the Suffragans and Biſhops) fair way is made to raiſe up Epiſcopacy again, to the height to which it had attained of latter times; eſpecially when as you will perhaps further conceive, from theſe propoſals, that all that were to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into any Benefice, muſt come in only by the Suffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, or Biſhops, and theſe likewiſe come in according as they had been wont to be admitted to theſe places in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times. And if this be all you would willingly ſubmit unto (as we have ſome reaſon to believe it is) that which you would yeeld unto for peace ſake, is not much.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) But ſince you lay great ſtreſſe upon what we quoted out of Dr. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher,</hi> we deſire the Reader would peruſe our anſwer throughly, in which he ſhall not finde, that we did <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:119100:73"/>
betwixt you and us, or as our own man (as in your next Paper much forgetting your ſelves, you do confidently aſſert)</q> but we quoted him only to prove the Antiquity of <note place="margin">
                     <hi>See Sect.</hi> 5.</note> Provinciall Aſſemblies, where the Paſtors of the ſeverall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations (to whom he alloweth a deciſive Vote) are Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. And we conceived, that if you ſhould be for Epiſcopacie in the height of it, he was the fitteſt Perſon to be quoted by us, to moderate you as to that particular. <q>It's true, we ſayd, That the Aſſemblies, that were by him propoſed within cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain limited bounds, ſaving that they were ſomething larger then ours (which we ſayd was but a circumſtantiall diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence) did hold proportion with thoſe ſet down in the form of Church Government, and were for ſuſtance the ſame with ours;</q> But here we underſtood him, and ſo do ſtill (elſe he is at a further diſtance from us, then we apprehended) that he would have all the Incumbent Presbyters or Paſtors of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Congregations, meeting in the ſeverall Chappels within the ſeverall Pariſhes, to have the liberty to be admitted to theſe Aſſemblies, as Members of them, and there to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſive Votes. This we gather from what he grants in his firſt Propoſall. Now theſe Aſſemblies thus Conſtituted, we ſayd, are for ſubſtance, that is, in regard of the Eſſence of them, the ſame with ours, where <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>all the Paſtors of the Churches, have liberty to be admitted into them; thoſe that are Unbenefic'd Miniſters as well as others. It's true, we, cautioning againſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Epiſcopacie, could not but be underſtood, that we judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Suffragans, and Biſhops mentioned in thoſe Propoſals, as ſuperfluous Additaments to thoſe Aſſemblies; and cautioning againſt the parting with the Ruling Elder, were to be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that we judged him to have a right to Vote in thoſe Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, as a Member or integrall part of them. But yet as that man, that hath ſome ſuperfluous Member, ſuppoſe a ſixth Finger, or wants an Hand, or Leg, or ſome other uſefull and neceſſary, or integrall part, or member, is for the ſubſtance, or in regard of his eſſence, the ſame man in kind, with him, in whom there is neither deficiency nor redundancy, in regard of Members; ſo it may be ſaid concerning the Aſſemblies, propoſed by Doctor <hi>Vſher,</hi> though there be both ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:119100:74"/>
in them, in regard of ſome integrall parts, and alſo ſome redundancy in regard of ſome ſuperfluous Additaments, that they are for ſubſtance, the ſame with the Aſſemblies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in the form of Church Government.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) We ſayd alſo in our Anſwer, that the Propoſalls <q>of the Aſſemblies above mentioned, were propounded in the yeare one thouſand ſix hundred forty one, by Doctor <hi>Vſher,</hi> as an Expedient for the prevention of thoſe Troubles, which afterwards did ariſe, about the matter of Church-Government; but theſe things were mentioned by us.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. To ſhew the wiſdome, and moderation of the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, and how far off he was, from the temper of ſundry in thoſe times, who ſo they might preſerve Epiſcopacy, in the height, that it was then grown to, did not matter the enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of three Kingdomes in a bloody War, which alſo they did.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That he was ſenſible of the great exorbitancy of Prelacy in thoſe times, and did interpoſe his endeavours to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the Government of the Church, neerer to the Primitive Pattern, and whereunto it is confeſſed, his Propoſalls ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But they were never mentioned by us, to intimate, that theſe Propoſalls, were to be the meaſure, of that Reformation, that was to be endeavoured after in theſe Nations: not onely in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of what we have to ſay againſt moderate Epiſcopacy (and of which afterwards anon) but alſo becauſe they having not been hearkened unto, by the late King, nor by that Party, that adhered to him (who did their utmoſt to have upheld Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy in its height) it is not equall (except what is there propounded, could be proved to be neceſſary, and by Divine Right) after the effuſion of ſo much blood, for the deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the People of God in theſe Nations, from the miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Yoke of Bondage they then ſighed under, and after the iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the War, and the determining of the Controverſie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that Party, that they ſhould be now admitted of, to the Hazard of our dear-bought Liberty, and the rayſing up againe out of its Grave, Epiſcopacy in the height of it, and thereby the inſlaving us again, in as great Servitude, or worſe then ever

And though the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Opportet haereſes eſſe, ut qui probati ſunt, manifeſti fiant inter vas.</hi> Yet the Apoſtle no where ſaith, <hi>Opportet E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopos eſſe, ut tollantur haereſes, quae manifeſtae fiunt:</hi> There muſt be Biſhops that thoſe Hereſies, which are amongſt you, may be removed.</q>

                  <q>(2) Becauſe the Holy-ghoſt, who could foreſee, what would enſue thereupon, would never ordain that for a remedy, which would not only be ineffectual to the cutting off of evil, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Stirrop for Antichriſt to get up into the Saddle. For if there be a neceſſity of ſetting up one Biſhop over many Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, for preventing Schiſms, there is as great a neceſſity for ſetting up one Archbiſhop over many Biſhops, and one Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch over many Archbiſhops, and one Pope over all, unleſs men will imagine, that there is a danger of Schiſme only amongſt Presbyters, and not among Biſhops and Archbiſhops, which is contrary to Reaſon, Truth, Hiſtory, and our own experience. And then they add, hence it is that <hi>Muſculus</hi> having proved, by <hi>Act.</hi> 20. <hi>Phil</hi> 1. 1. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 5. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 1. that in the Apoſtles times, a Biſhop and a Presbyter were all one, he adds. But after the Apoſtles times, when amongſt the Elders of the Church,

(as <hi>Hierom</hi> ſayth) Schiſms aroſe, and as I verily think, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſtrive for Majority, by little and little, they began to chooſe one amongſt the reſt, out of the number of Elders, that ſhould be above the reſt in an higher degree, &amp; called Biſhop. But whether that device of man profited the Church or no, the times following could better judge, then when it firſt began. And further addeth, that if <hi>Hierom,</hi> &amp; others had ſeen as much, as they that came after, they would have concluded, that it was never brought in by Gods Spirit, to take away Schiſm, as was pretended; but brought in by Satan to waſt &amp; deſtroy the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Miniſtry that fed the Flock. Thus far <hi>Muſculus. Sadael</hi> alſo hath this memorable paſſage. The difference between Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and other Miniſters came in for remedy of Schiſme. But they that deviſed it, little thought what a Gate they opened to the ambition of Biſhops.</q> Hence alſo Dr. <hi>Whitakers</hi> asking, how <q>came in the inequality between Biſhops &amp; Presbyters, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out of <hi>Hierom,</hi> that the Schiſm and Faction of ſome occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned the ancient Government to be changed—which ſaith he, however deviſed at firſt for a remedy againſt Schiſme, yet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny holy and wiſe men, have judged it more pernitious, then the Diſeaſe it ſelf; and although it did not by and by appear, yet miſerable experience afterwards ſhewed it.

particularly for the prevention of Schiſme, yet it not being a way of God, the device failed, as ſad experience in after times ſhewed, the remedy proving worſe then the diſeaſe, as not only thoſe reverend and learned Authors quoted by our Brethren ſhew, but alſo Church Story makes forth abundantly, and which was reaſon ſufficient, why we ſhould not ſo readily ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, to re-admit moderate Epiſcopacy as you expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</p>

Now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it could be proved that the Superiority of a Biſhop above a Presbyter, were an Inſtitution of Jeſus Chriſt, prudence teacheth to fly from that, as far as we may, with a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, that heretofore hath proved ſo burthenſome and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous; Eſpecially conſidering that,</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) If moderate Epiſcopacy, ſhould once have footing in this Land, there is very great danger, it would preſently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croach <note place="margin">2 <hi>Reaſon.</hi>
                  </note> upon the Paſtors right, and in time grow up to the full height, that it was in heretofore. Sad experience for Ages toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, hath ſhewed how through the Ambition &amp; pride of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops

(that loved with <hi>Diotrephes</hi> to have the preheminence) the Paſtors, as to the governing of their Flocks, were ſpoiled of all power: Out of what we quoted even now, you might take notice, <q>that moderate Epiſcopacy (brought in at the firſt upon prudentiall grounds) yet became a Stirrop for Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt to get up into the Saddle; that firſt Ambition crept in, which at length begat Antichriſt, ſet him in his Chair, and brought the Yoke of Bondage upon the Church;</q> for ſo Dr. <hi>Whitaker</hi> expreſſed himſelf concerning it.</p>
               <p>And 1. Are there not ſtill in the hearts of the Sons of men, the ſame Seeds of Pride and Ambition as in former times? And is there not hereupon cauſe to fear, if there ſhould be a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of God ſo far, as to admit of that, which would cheriſh and warm thoſe Corruptions, the ſame bitter Fruit would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear as heretofore? Is it to be wondred, that the ſame cauſe, upon the ſame occaſion, being ſtill like it ſelf, and ever for kind one and the ſame, ſhould produce the like effects as heretofore it hath done?</p>
               <p>But 2. Yet further, If moderate Epiſopacy be no Plant of Gods planting (as if it be not <hi>Jure divino,</hi> and yet an Officer introduced into Gods Houſe, there is no reaſon why it ſhould lay claim to him, as to its Author) may it be thought ſtrange, if like unto a wild Vine, it ſhould grow luxuriant? Or like a Weed, that is ſet in a fat Soil, it ſhould grow as rank as ever? eſpecially if warmed by the Favour of Princes, and great Ones, that might be induced out of reſpect to their own Intereſts, to ſmile upon it, yea, to countenance it ſo far, as to diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance the moſt faithfull Paſtors in the Land, that would not dance after their Pipe, even to the outing them of their places, and ſpoiling them of all Rule, that ſo the Darling of Epiſcopy, that might be charmed, might grow the greater.</p>
               <p>But 3. if yet we ſhould not be ſo wiſe as to hearken to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſhould not the experience of thoſe, that thereby purchaſed their after wiſdome, at a dear rate, leſſon us ſufficiently to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware how we meddle with moderate Epiſcopacy (that will hardly be moderated) but would be found (to the coſt of thoſe, that would be ſo fooliſh as to make further triall) to break all Bonds, and limitations, though never ſo many and
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:119100:79"/>
ſtrong, and never ſo wiſely made. Little is propounded for the moderating of Epiſcopacy by Doctor <hi>Vſher,</hi> in his Reducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Epiſcopacy, to the form of Synodicall Government, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the ancient Church (although we believe his Deſign in the Propoſals there, was very pious, and proceeded as well from a ſenſe of the great Exorbitancy, that Prelacy was grown to of late times, and its great unlikeneſs to what it was, in the purer times of the Church, when it was firſt admitted; as out of a deſire to tender ſome expedient for the prevention of thoſe troubles, which did afterwards ariſe about the matter of Church-government) unto thoſe ſtrickt Bands, nay Shackles and Fetters, that ſo far as mans wiſdome could foreſee, were layd upon it by the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and yet it burſt them all and which ſhews that it is of that nature, that it cannot eaſily be tamed. In his Propoſals, ſo far as we can diſcern, the Suffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans that were to be conſtant Moderators in the Aſſemblies o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Aſſemblies were all of them to have Negative Votes. Theſe (as from the Plat-form it ſelf is manifeſt) were to do all, and conclude matters according to the major part of Voices in theſe Aſſemblies. But it is not ſaid, that if the Suffragan, or Biſhop, or Archbiſhop were diſſenting, any thing might paſs accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the major part of the Voyces in the ſeverall Aſſemblies notwithwanding. And hereupon if theſe conſtant Moderators were corrupt, they might propound matters, or not propound them to the Aſſemblies, as they pleaſed. And when they were propounded, yet not concurring with the Aſſemblies, obſtruct all their proceedings. Beſides if all perſons that were admitted into any Paſtorall Charges, and having cure of Soules, were to come in onely at their Doore, how ſoon might the Miniſtry be ſo farre corrupted, as that it were eaſie for them, to procure the major part, in thoſe Aſſemblies, to Vote according to their mindes, to over-ſway, and over-ballance the reſt of the Members of theſe Aſſemblies, that though godly and able, yet might not be ſo favoured by the times, as to be admitted into any Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces (as they have been called) of any conſiderable value, and ſo might be like to be for outward eſtate poor, and in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:119100:79"/>
the more contemptible. But yet further, if the Suffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans muſt come into their places by the Biſhops, and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops into theirs, as in former times, if there ſhould be corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion here (where there is more danger then in any) in the higher Aſſemblies (which yet ſhould be the freeſt from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and ſhould ſtill be the better, the higher we go in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the greater number of perſons, of the choiceſt and beſt Abilities) there were danger of far greater corruption, then in the lower. For all the Suffragans are expreſly by theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals to be Members of the Dioceſan Synod, and of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, or incumbent Paſtors, beſides the Suffragans, it is ſaid, the reſt, or a ſelect number out of every Deanry, as appears from the third Propoſall. And as touching the Provinciall Synod, it is ſayd, it might conſiſt of all the Biſhops and Suffragans, and ſuch other of the Clergy as ſhould be elected out of every Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs within the Province, as is clear from the fourth Propoſall. And ſo if the Biſhops and Suffragans ſhould be corrupted, that were to be, as conſtant Moderators in theſe Aſſemblies, ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Members of the higheſt Aſſemblies: by their Power and Dignity, and greater port in the World, and through the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lgence of the times, it might eaſily come to paſs, that theſe might be ſo biaſſed, that leſs good were to be expected from the higher Aſſemblies (where yet the remedy ſhould lye and whither Appeals were to be made) then in the lower. To ſay nothing, that through the Favour of great ones, if they ſhould ſide with the Suffragans, or Biſhops (that might be corrupted the meetings of theſe Aſſemblies (though appointed by Law as well as Parliaments) might be prevented and hindred, or if they might be eaſily ſpoiled of their Freedom. We have taken the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to ſuggeſt, what exceptions the forementioned Propoſals, that were made by Dr <hi>Vſher</hi> are lyable to; and without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to reflect in the leaſt meaſure on ſo reverend a Perſon (whom in regard of his Piety and Learning we honour, though herein of a different apprehenſion from us) we believing he propounded what he did, with an honeſt inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as we have ſayd before.

thereby, to ſet up a Wall of Partition betwixt them and us; as we have uſed this Freedome, only to ſhew what danger there is leaſt if moderate Epiſcopacy ſhould be admitted again, it ſhould within a while grow to that height, that they as well as we, growing weary of it, would be ready to caſt it off, as an inſufferable Yoke. We are the fuller of Jealouſies in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, when we conſider, how far ſhort, the Propoſals menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, do fall, of the ſtrong Bonds that were layd upon Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and yet it burſt them all.

And whereupon the Parliament that then was (which will be renowned to all Poſterity, for eaſing of the Church of their intolerable Preſſures, and vindicating the Civil Liberty of the Engliſh Nation) did proceed to an ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter extirpation of it.

               <p n="3">(3.) But yet further we deſire it might be conſidered, that the admitting of moderate Epiſcopacy, would breed great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfaction <note place="margin">3. <hi>Reaſon.</hi>
                  </note> to ſundry godly and conſcientious Miniſters and Chriſtians at home in theſe three Nations, and occaſion much ſtrife and contentious Debates, that were likely to ariſe about it: ſome conceiving it to be utterly unlawfull, as being the

Introduction of an Officer into the Church, that is not of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Inſtitution. Others that were ſatisfied touching the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of it in it ſelf, and yet judged it not neceſſary, might have fears, leaſt moderate Epiſcopacy once admitted, might be a ſtep to introduce that kind of Epiſcopacy or Prelacy, that had been expreſly covenanted againſt: and upon that account, might judge, they were obliged by their Covenant to foreſee, ſo far as they could, ſuch an occaſion, and to ſhun it. Others again might be much divided amongſt themſelves (if they got over the former Blocks) touching the Rules, according unto which, Epiſcopacy ſhould be moderated, ſome apprehending the Bonds layd upon it to be too ſtraight, and others againe thinking them to be too looſe. And theſe Diviſions were like to be amongſt perſons of all Ranks; Nobles, Knights, Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, Commons of all ſorts, both of the Gentry, Miniſtry, and others. Whereupon there were great danger to grow many Debates in the Parliament, when that ſhould aſſemble in the City, and throughout the Land, Conteſts of Miniſters one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>againſt another in the Pulpits, and at the Preſſes, and amongſt private Chriſtians in their private Conferences, as it hath been heretofore, about the Ceremonies and Epiſcopacy, to the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rending and diſtracting of our already rent and torne Church, and which at this time would be the more dangerous, when as the poſture of Affairs doth cry aloud upon the wiſeſt Phyſitians, both by their Skill and Power, to interpoſe for the healing of Breaches in <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> that through our Diviſions, we be not made a Prey to the common Enemies of our Religion,; and therefore have no need, that ſuch a dangerous bone of Contention ſhould be caſt in amongſt us, as moderate Epiſcopacy might be like to prove, to the ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the hearts of Friends, and gratifying onely of thoſe that would rejoyce in our ruine.</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) It is not alſo to be ſleighted, that by admitting of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Epiſcopacy, great offence might be taken by the beſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed <note place="margin">4 <hi>Reaſon.</hi>
                  </note> Churches abroad. They have taken notice, that in the ſolemn Covenant, that was entred into by theſe Nations, <q>there was not onely an Engagement, to endeavour the extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of Popery and Prelacy (that is, Church-government

by Archbiſhops, Biſhops, their Chancellors, and Commiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Deans, Deans and Chapters, Archdeacons, and all other Eccleſiaſticall Officers depending on that Hierarchy) accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to which, the Parliaments that have been, have conſtantly declared, that no Indulgency ſhould be granted to Popery and Prelacy:</q> and this out of a conſcientious reſpect (as we have hinted before in our anſwer to your firſt Paper) unto this ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn engagement, as we judged: But there was alſo a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe <q>to endeavour the Reformation of Religion in <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> in Doctrine, Worſhip, Diſcipline, and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, according to the word of God, and the example of the beſt reformed Churches.</q> Theſe things have been publiſhed to the World, and are known abroad, and however other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters contained in the Covenant, that are of a civil Concernment may be judged of; they being in their own nature variable, and not of the like neceſſity in themſelves with matters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the things of God, and to be endeavoured after, onely in a ſubordinate way unto Gods matters, and never to be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, in the manifeſt deſtructiveneſs of the intereſt of Religion, that ſhould be looked upon by all, as the greateſt and chiefeſt intereſt, yet they are not likely to imagine, that moderate E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopacy (that is not by them admitted but diſowned) can be of that neceſſity for us in theſe Lands (for which they do not judge, there was any rule given in Gods word, requiring the ſetting of it up at the firſt) as that after all the learned Debates, touching Church-government, for ſeverall years together, that have been in the reverend Aſſembly of Divines, that ſate by Ordinance of Parliament at <hi>Weſtminſter;</hi> and after their hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble advice to the Parliament touching the Presbyterian Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as that Government, they conceived, was moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the word of God (as it is evident it is moſt, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the example of the beſt reformed Churches) and after the Parliament engaged alſo in that ſolemn Covenant, had (as they may conceive) in purſuance thereof, made ſo great a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, in the ſetting up of this Presbyterian Government, that they paſſed by Ordinance, the form of Church-government, <hi>Anno,</hi> 1648 after advice had with the Aſſembly of Divines, as that Church-government which was to be uſed in the Church

of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> it ſhould be admitted of, to the ſetting up a partition Wall betwixt us and them, inſtead of coming neerer to them, ſo far as we may do, according to Gods word, according to the ſolemn Engagement. They cannot hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but be greatly grieved, when they ſhall ſee their hopes ſo far diſappointed, as they may hereupon be brought to fear, leaſt if moderate Epiſcopacy be entertained, as the Church-Government of theſe Lands, after a while, that very Prelacy in the height of it, that in the time of our Affliction was vomited up by theſe Nations as loathſome, may be ſwallowed down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. Now we leave it to wiſe men to judge, whether (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at ſuch a time as this, when Popiſh Enemies are banding themſelves together againſt us, and it is of ſo great advantage, for our own preſervation, and the preſervation of the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that the Proteſtant Party throughout Chriſtendome, ſhould endeavour after Union) it be prudential to miniſter ſuch occaſion of grief and jealouſie, concerning us to our beſt Friends abroad, as to admit of that, which would be ſo much to their diſſatisfaction: as it would be occaſion of endleſs ſtrife and debate amongſt our ſelves at home, as hath been ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; to ſay nothing of the hatefulneſs of it unto <hi>Scotland,</hi> that yet we hope is lookt upon by <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> as a neer Siſter, and Neighbour Church.</p>

As touching ſuch that are for it in their Judgments, that are ſober and godly, and againſt Epiſcopacy in the height of it, they might be accommodated in the Presbyterian way, with far more ſafety, and far leſs occaſion of Offence; <q>as we gather from the Aſſociations of the Miniſters of ſeverall Counties, that are printed, and particularly from that of <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Vide pag.</hi> 13. Of the <hi>Eſſex</hi> Agreement.</note> 
                     <hi>Eſſex,</hi> wherein they profeſs, that many of them think, according to Scripture, and the way of divers reformed Churches, there ſhould be ſome adjoyned to the Miniſter in Government called ruling Elders, yet that divers alſo of them, are diſſatisfied as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:119100:83"/>
ſuch Elders; but all of them alſo conceive it meet, and a Miniſters wiſdome to ſee with more Eyes then his own, and have the beſt help he can, both to acquaint him with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of his people, and to aſſiſt him in matters of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, that cannot ſo ſafely and conveniently be done by him ſelf alone. Therefore they alſo agree (as they ſhall ſee it fea ſonable and fit in reſpect of their people) to deſire the Aſſiſtance of ſome godly and diſcreet Perſons of their reſpective Congregations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> And therefore as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ruling Elders (as there was a ſubmiſſion in the dayes of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopacy, to Chancellours, and Commiſſaries) we conceive that moderate Epiſcopall men might admit theſe upon pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentiall grounds, though they did not acknowledge the <hi>Jus divinum,</hi> of their Office (and which opinion of them, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding our own perſwaſion, we are far from impoſing upon others) and we do alſo hope, that ſuch as would make tryall of them, would have occaſion to bleſs God, for thoſe great helps, that might be offered unto them, by them: both for the better acquainting them with the Converſations of their people, as alſo for the guiding and governing of them. As we do alſo further humbly conceive; there might be ſuch a proportioning of them, for the number of them in the higher Aſſemblies, that neither it might be burthenſome to the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, that might be delegated to ſuch Aſſemblies, when they are over many: nor the Aſſemblies be diſappointed for want of a <hi>Quorum</hi> of ruling Elders, as ſometimes they have been; nor any occaſion of fear given unto any, that the Miniſters might be over-voted by the Elders, in matters of greateſt weight and concernment, which yet ſuppoſes a diviſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Miniſters and Elders, which in our own experience we have never met with. And as touching a ſtanding Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator, that ſome moderate Epiſcopall men are for, we think their Conſciences might he ſatisfied in the way of Moderators, as they are in uſe with us: we not diſcerning, what can be ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by them, as neceſſary to be tranſacted by him from Gods Word, but it may be ſafely tranſacted by the Moderators of our Aſſemblies. And as touching our Brethren of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregationall way, we are ſure, moderate Epiſcopacy will be
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:119100:83"/>
no expedient, to bring them and us unto neerer Union: but conceive, that as the Aſſembly of Divines, did long agon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon that Work of Accommodation with them: ſo if that Work were re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> aſſumed by the appointment and interpoſition of the Civil Magiſtrate, through the bleſſing of God, we hope it might be brought to ſuch a concluſion, not onely with them, but alſo with thoſe, that are godly and moderate Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that are of the Epiſcopall way, that without admittance of moderate Epiſcopacy (that would not further it) there might be an happy cloſure of breaches in this rent and torne Church, all parties that have ſoundneſs, and ſavour in them, ſeeming to be weary of their Diviſions, and to earneſtly thirſt and pant after Union.</p>
               <p>But we hope by this time, the ſober and judicious Reader is ſatisfied, that we had ſome reaſon to caution againſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Epiſcopacy, as we did, even where we profeſs our ſelves earneſt for peace; and that If you had conſidered things well, you had no reaſon fully to expect, that we ſhould admit of that expedient, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> you propounded for an Accommodation; w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> we for ſeverall weighty reaſons, had expreſly cautioned againſt.</p>
               <p>But we have now done with what you propounded, as the way wherein you expected fully we ſhould have cloſed with you, and ſhall now go on with you unto what follows; wherein you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare your ſelves, <q>That they who diſturb this cloſure and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, are the ruling Elders;</q> that yet were not only cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen out of the people, but at the firſt conſtitution of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational Elderſhips, were examined and approved by this Claſs, as fit to joyn with the Miniſters of the Word, in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning of the Church, and ſolemnly ſet a part with exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Prayer for that Work, although not ordained for to preach the Goſpel, or adminiſter the Sacraments, and ſo not meer <hi>Lay-men,</hi> as you apprehend them to be. <q>Now of theſe you ſay, you wiſh not (with the Apoſtle) that they were cut off, but that they were taken away, that trouble you, for you ſay (ſpeaking of theſe) onely they let, that will let, untill they be taken out of the away.</q> Indeed the Apoſtle (unto whoſe words you allude) ſpeaks of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, that letted and would let, the revelation of Antichriſt,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:119100:84"/>
untill he were taken away, and if after Antichriſt, hath been caſt out of this Land, the retaining of the ruling Elders were likely to be a let to his ſetting foot again in it, it would be very ill upon that account to part with them, but we do not diſcern how the retaining of the ruling Elders ſhould have hindred your cloſure and conjunction with us, if you had been cordiall for Peace and Union; for though you could not admit them, upon the divine right of their Office, yet you, who excepted not againſt the lawfulneſs of retaining of High Commiſſioners, Chancellours, and Commiſſaries (and of which we ſhall ſpeak more fully in our anſwer to your laſt Paper) under the Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall Government; might have admitted of ruling Elders, on prudentiall grounds, upon the Principles of ſundry moderate Epiſcopall men; and as they have done, of which before: <q>and as you may ſee one zealous enough againſt the <hi>Jus divinum,</hi> of ruling Elders Office, is not againſt them, as an expedient and behoovefull Order in the Church, and where the right Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of State, any where moving upon prudentiall grounds, ſhall find the conveniency of them.</q> See <hi>Velitationes Polemicae</hi> by J.

And we think both you and we may learn much from the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and elaborate Labours of modern Authors.

And as touching Dr. <hi>Sutlive,</hi> they have a remarkable paſſage, which they note in the Margin, <hi>pag.</hi> 131. which we think fit to recite in their own words, which are as followeth. As for this Dr. <hi>Sutlive</hi> (divers times here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after mentioned) the Reader may pleaſe to take notice here once for all, that he told a reverend Miniſter in <hi>London,</hi> yet li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and ready (if need were) to teſtifie the ſame upon Oath, (who declared it to one of the Authors of this Treatiſe, <hi>Feb.</hi> 
                  <q>16. 1646.) <hi>That he was ſorry with all his heart, that ever he put Pen to Paper to write againſt</hi> Beza, <hi>as he had done, in the behalf of the proud domineering Prelates.</hi>
                  </q> And he ſpoke this with great indignation. It is good for men then to take heed, that they be not too hot for the Prelacy, nor too earneſt in contending againſt the Office of ruling Elders, for we ſee, they may come to repent hereof, before they die.</p>

               <p>
                  <q>Here we have an enumeration of ſundry Officers of the Church, and amongſt others there are Helps, Governments. <note place="margin">

                     <hi>By Helps are</hi> meant Deacons (as not onely our reformed Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, but <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> and <hi>Eſtius,</hi> and others obſerve.) And by <hi>Governments</hi> are meant the <hi>ruling Elders.</hi>
                  </q> That this may the better appear, they do here prove ſix things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That by Governments are meant men exerciſing Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Abſtract being put for the Concrete; which they <q>ſhew appears firſt, by the beginning of the Verſe, <hi>God hath

ſet ſome in his Church,</hi> which relates to Perſons, not to Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Secondly, By the 29, and 30 Verſes, where the Apoſtle ſpeaks <hi>Concretively</hi> of thoſe things, which he had ſpoken of before Abſtractively. Are all Workers of Miracles? Have all the gifts of Healing? Do all ſpeak with Tongues? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſo by conſequence, Are all Helpers? are all Governours?</q>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <q>2. That the Governour here meant, muſt needs be a Church Governour, not the civil Magiſtrate, becauſe this is beſide the whole ſcope of the Chapter, treating meerly on Spirituall Church Matters, not at all of Secular or Civil. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe alſo it is ſaid expreſly, That he is ſeated in the Church. Now the Magiſtrate, as ſuch, is not placed by God in the Church, but in the Common-weale.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And laſtly, Becauſe the Apoſtle writes of ſuch Governours, that had at that time actuall exiſtence in the Church: whereas neither then, nor ſome hundred years after, was there any Chriſtian Magiſtrate.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) That this Church-Governour is ſeated by God in his Church, and ſo is a Plant of Gods one planting.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That this Church Governour, is a Church Officer. For though it be a queſtion amongſt the Learned, whether ſome of the perſons here named, as the <hi>Workers of Miracles,</hi> and thoſe that had the <hi>Gift ef Healing, and of Tongues,</hi> were ſeated by God, as Officers in the Church, and not rather only as emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Members, endued with theſe eminent Gifts; yet it is moſt certain, that whoſoever is ſeated by God in his Church, as a <hi>Church-Governour,</hi> muſt needs be a <hi>Church Officer.</hi> 
                  <q>For the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Gift doth neceſſarily imply an Office, which they do further ſhew from the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="5">
                  <q>5. That this Church-Governour is an ordinary and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Officer in his Church, as they ſhew does appear from the perpetuall neceſſity of him in the Church, a Church without Government, being as a Ship without a Pilot, as a Kingdome without a Magiſtrate, as a World without a Sun.</q>

                  <q>6. That this Church-governour is an Officer contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed in the Text from the Apoſtles, Prophets, Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, and all other Officers in the Church. This they prove,</q>

We conceive by this account gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, it is manifeſt enough unto the unprejudiced Reader, that the learned Labours of our reverend Brethren in this matter, and their Arguments urged from theſe very Texts, that we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, were not ſo contemptible, but that they might have merited a better anſwer (when we referred you to them) then to have been turned off as not worth the weighing, becauſe they are but of <hi>Yeſterday.</hi> And however our pains be accounted of by you in tranſcribing out of them, what we have done, yet we hope it will not be eſteemed uſeleſs by judicious and ſober per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſuch who never have ſeen the Labours of our Brethren in this kind, having this advantage by it, that they have a taſt gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them, of what is more at large ſayd, by feverall reverend, learned, and godly Divines, for the Divine right of that Office, that is ſo much deſpiſed, and hereby have ſome direction given them, where they may find this truth more fully vindicated; as they alſo, that are acquainted fully with their Labours, may reap this Fruit by what we have recited, that the memory of what they knew before, will hereby be revived; and hence it may be to both ſufficiently manifeſt, that ſo much is ſpoken touching this matter, that it will not be to any great purpoſe to add any more.</p>
               <p>But now let us conſider, what you oppoſe unto all that is ſaid, by the Authors we quoted for the <hi>Jus divinum</hi> of the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Government, and particularly of the Office of ruling Elders. In the firſt place we take notice, that when we ſaid, <hi>We could not part with the ruling Elders, unleſs we ſhould betray the truth of Chriſt (as we judged) by this Parentheſis you gather, that we are not ſo wedded to the opinion, but that we can, and will ſubmit to better reaſon, when offered to us.</hi> Unto which we ſay, That we are ready to hear, what you or any others ſhall preſent unto us, for the clearing up the mind and will of God, in this, or any
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:119100:88"/>
other point in Controverſie, amongſt ſuch as are godly, ſober, and Orthodox, in the main points of Chriſtian Religion. <hi>And if you will not wilfully and pertinaciouſly hold a contrary Tenent,</hi> as you profeſs, or at leaſt a Tenent contrary to what your Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples might allow you, there would be the greater hopes, that you would ceaſe the debate touching this matter. But before we can be convinced that the ruling Elder is not an Officer of Jeſus Chriſt, held forth in thoſe Texts, that we quoted, we muſt have far ſtronger reaſons brought, then you urge, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though you profeſs, <hi>that you will proceed to ſhew us that Lay-Elders</hi> (as you miſtake them) <hi>are not meant nor mentioned in thoſe Texts by us alledged.</hi> Here is indeed much undertaken, but little per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. And however you promiſe <hi>to do this hereafter more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if what is comprehended in this Paper be not judged ſatisfactory,</hi> yet in your next, wherein you would make ſhew, as if you had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in a full reply to our Anſwer, you perform nothing. So ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiea matter is it with you to undertake great things, and fall ſhort in your performances. But we muſt here needs tell you, that if you will indeed ſatisfie us, you muſt perform more, then onely (as here you do) ſend us <hi>to the Fathers in generall, or more particular Councils, or the Fathers apart</hi> (and which you will have to be the onely ſure rule for the interpretation of Scriptures, though how ſoundly this is aſſerted by you will come to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined in our anſwer to your next Paper) neither muſt you think, that the bare allegation of the expoſition of ſome Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers (for we are not wholly deſtitute of the teſtimony of them touching the matter in controverſie, as we ſhall ſhew anon) ought to be of that weight with us, as that they ſhould be forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with received, as the certain interpretations of theſe Texts, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Arguments, that are urged from them, by moderne Synods and Aſſemblies, learned and able Divines, Expoſiters of the Scriptures, both of our own and other reforned Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches for that interpretation of them, which we cloſe with, and whereof we have given account already in part. And yet we are far from contemning either Fathers or Councils, but ſhall give them all that due reſpect, that our truly Proteſtant Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines have given them in their Writings againſt the Papiſts; as we do heartily wiſh, that you had not expreſſed your ſelves,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:119100:89"/>
eſpecially in your next Paper, to be too Popiſh, in reſpect of that Authority, which you profeſs they are in with you, which yet is an honour given them, that they themſelves would have diſavowed, and of which afterwards more fully.</p>
               <p>In the mean ſeaſon you have not dealt fairly with <hi>Calvin</hi> in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering upon him, what he doth not ſay, though in your Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Copy you cover the matter, not quoting the place, where he ſhould aſſert any ſuch thing, as you alledge him for. The thing you charge upon him in both, is one and the ſame. Your words are theſe, <hi>Calvin ſaith, there can be no better, nor ſurer remedy of deciding of controverſies, no better ſenſe nor interpretation of Scripture then what is given by the Fathers in ſuch Councils.</hi> The places you quote in that Copy you preſented unto us, are thoſe in his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 9. <hi>Sect.</hi> 8. 13. But in theſe places, there is nothing that can with any colour be alledged to make out what you charge upon him. In the 8. <hi>Sect.</hi> it is confeſſed, he would not have all Councils condemned, and the Acts of them all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcinded (as we are far from deſiring any ſuch thing) but he ſaith, <hi>Quoties concilii alicujus decretum profertur, expendi primum di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligentur velim, quo tempore habitum ſit, qua de cauſa habitum, &amp; quo concilio, quales homines interfuerint: deinde illud ipſum, de quo agitur, ad Scripturae amuſſim examinari; idque in eum modum, ut concilii de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitio pondus ſuum habeat ſitque inſtar praejudicii, neque tamen examen, quod dixi, impediat.</hi> You may here perceive, that as he would not have the determinations of all Synods promiſcuouſly to be admitted, ſo he would have their decrees that are produced, to be examined according to the rule of Scripture, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that reverence which he (from whom therein we differ not) doth give them. But you may ſee, he further goes on and adds, <hi>Vtinam eum omnes modum ſervarent, quem praeſcrib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

and <hi>Augustine,</hi> whom he cites, would have all Controverſies touching matters of Religion to be determined by the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities or Teſtimonies of Scriptures.

That there can be no better ſence nor interpretation of the Scriptures, then what is given by the Fathers in ſuch Councils?</hi> All that <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith, is, That he acknowledgeth theſe Councils, did in Doctrinals rightly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret the Scriptures, but he would not have their interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Scripture for to be the rule of its interpretation, as in your next Paper (when there is a difference about interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Scripture) you aſſert it ought to be; and which there you alledging this place of <hi>Calvin</hi> would repreſent him to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronize, and for which purpoſe you do alſo ſeem to alledge him here. Although the Reader, by what hath been quoted out of him in this Section, will ſee the contrary. Beſides, that he did not ſay touching matters of Diſcipline and Government (which are the things onely in Controverſie betwixt you and us) thoſe Councils, he ſpake of, did containe nothing but the pure and native interpretation of the Scriptures, but limited the ſame to Doctrinals, as we have ſhewed. And therefore we leave it to the Reader to judge, whether you have thus far dealt fairely with <hi>Calvin,</hi> or no.</p>
               <p>You alſo quoted the thirteenth Section of this ninth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>lib.</hi> 4.

               <p>As touching the Fathers, you wiſh us to conſult on <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. intimating out of Doctor <hi>Andrews,</hi> 
                  <q>That not one of them applyeth it to the Church Government, and as much (you ſay) may be ſayd for the other Texts, not one Father in their Comment giveth ſuch a ſenſe, and which you are ſo confident of, that you offer, that if we find one expoſition for us, you will yeild us all.</q> Unto this we ſay,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) That we believe all wiſe and ſober Readers will eaſily diſcern, that your over-much confidence hath put you on to over-ſhoot a great deal too far. For we can hardly be brought to perſwade our ſelves, that you have any of you, much leſs all of you, who are the Subſcribers of this Paper, conſulted all the Fathers upon any, and much leſs upon all theſe Texts. And if ſo, it was a great deal too much preſumption to make ſuch an offer, upon the Teſtimony of Doctor <hi>Andrews</hi> (that yet is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by you to ſpeak but to onely one of the Texts) or any other, having not conſulted all the Fathers your ſelves, and
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:119100:90"/>
that upon every Text. For what an hazard do you put your Cauſe upon? If but one Father be produced againſt you in this matter, if you ſhould be taken at your word, it is quite loſt. And if it be Gods Cauſe and Truth you ſtand for, can you be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, that you have offered to quit it upon ſuch eaſie tearms? But we will be more liberall to you, then to take you at ſuch a diſadvantage, though you have been too preſumpteouſly li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall in making ſuch an offer.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) But ſuppoſe none of the Fathers could be produced thus to expound any of theſe Texts; If from the Texts themſelves, and what may be urged from other places of the Scriptures both in the Old and New Teſtament, it may be gathered, that that is the meaning of them, which we with ſundry other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne Authors give, why ſhould this Interpretation be reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe not backed with the Teſtimony of ſome of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers thus expounding them? Is not the Scripture ſufficient to expound it ſelf? This indeed is your opinion, as appeareth plainly from your next Paper, but the Popiſh unſoundneſs of it we queſtion not but to diſcover, when we come to it.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) But if the Fathers do not many of them determine the Controverſie touching ruling Elders from theſe Texts (it ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been ſtarted ſince their time) yet is it not ſufficient, if they ſhall be, ſeverall of them, found to allow of the thing it ſelf, and give teſtimony to the being of theſe Officers in the Church in their time?

               <p>We might alledge more Teſtimonies of the Fathers for the proof of what we are in hand with, but that we judge theſe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient.

But they will have them to be one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as our Church-wardens, or rather as our Veſtry-men, as one of them ſpeaks. See the Author of Epiſcopacy by divine right, <hi>pag.</hi> 146. whereas the Teſtimonies alledged ſhew, they were Rulers and Judges in Cauſes Eccleſiaſticall, and did aſſiſt the Miniſters of the Word, in the ruling and governing of the Church, which being very clear from the above mentioned Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies, and others of the like kind; <q>another zealous enough againſt them, would have them to be ſome or other in chief Rank amongſt the reſt of the people, taken in occaſionally for advice and preſent aſſiſtance, and ſo an extraordinary kind of Church-Guardians, without any peculiar and ſetled Juriſdiction. Which is but <hi>gratis dictum,</hi> ſayd without all proof. See <hi>Velitatienes polemicae,</hi> by <hi>I. D. pag.</hi> 96 But at laſt this Author, as not ſatisfied with former Anſwers given, and granting that the Fathers in truth do make for them (as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they do) yet he would not have their Teſtimonies amount, to ſo much as to the clearing up of Divine Right, ſo ſtrongly ſtood upon by divers, as he ſpeaks.</q> But the matter of Fact then is granted, that there were ſuch Eccleſiaſtical Officers which the Fathers owned and allowed of. And being the Divine Right of their Office was not then queſtioned; it is as eaſie for us to affirm. that as thoſe Fathers did not deny it, ſo they owned it, as it is for that Author to ſay, <q>
                     <hi>That they were but admitted as an expedient and behoovefull Order in the Church, or on prudentiall grounds;</hi>

your ſatisfaction, as we think, according to your Principles.</p>
               <p>But now to return to the Texts alledged by us, to prove the Divine Right of the ruling Elders Office. After you had ſent us to the Fathers to conſult them, you tell us, <q>Many there are, that apply them to the Biſhops, and amongſt theſe you inſtance Doctor <hi>Fulk,</hi> applying theſe Texts to the Biſhops onely, whom (you ſay) you quote in regard of the moderate Judgment, he was ſuppoſed to be of in point of Church-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</q>

               <p n="1">1. That he onely ſaith, for Order and ſeemly Government there was alwaies one Principall, to whom by long uſe of the Church the name of Biſhop or ſuperintendent hath been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed. By which words he ſeems clearly to intimate, that that ſuperiority, which a Biſhop had above the reſt of the Clergy or Presbyters, was but an Eccleſiaſticall Conſtitution

onely in that he aſcribes it to Order and Decency.</p>

                  </gap>, for which purpoſe you alledge him; but that by ancient uſe of Speech (which might be different from the uſe of Scripture, and as in this particular it was) he is called a Biſhop, which is in Scripture called <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By which we doubt not it is clear to the judicious Reader, that Doctor <hi>Fulk</hi> is not in the number of thoſe many, that (you ſay) apply theſe Texts to the Biſhops onely, taking the word Biſhops, as you take them.</p>
               <p>We have now done with that you have produced here to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie us touching Lay-Elders (as you call them) that they are not meant nor mentioned in thoſe Texts by us alledged, which you undertook with ſome confidence, but have as unſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily performed, as (we think) ever any did, that did attempt a matter of this nature. Yet you now proceed hereupon to make your inference. <hi>That therefore it can be no betraying the truth of Chriſt to part with the ruling Elders, if we will ſeriouſly weigh it in the Ballance of impartiall and unprejudicate reaſon</hi> (which yet you have not produced, that might with any ſhew, be ſufficient to ſatisfie the Conſcience, either of us, or any other men) <hi>and to take in the other (i. e.</hi> the Biſhops) which you ſay would be <hi>but a ſtrengthning and a backing of it,</hi> though we ſee not how: And now you fall upon exhorting and beſeeching us <hi>in the name of God</hi> (which we hope is dear unto us) <hi>and in the tender Bowels of Jeſus Chriſt</hi> (for whom we are willing to ſuffer the loſs of all things, and to whom we profeſs to owe our ſelves, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever

But after you have propounded the tearms of reconciliation, which <hi>you beſeech and beg of us, againe and againe to accept of</hi> (though we ſhould not need to be ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly intreated, if they were ſafely to be admitted of) you come to urge ſome Fruits, that would enſue upon our hearkning to your motion. And here we ſhall not deny, but the <hi>bleſſing that might redound to all parties,</hi> in a juſt way of reconciliation, would <hi>be unconceivable,</hi> as it is that, we ſhall be ready to lay out our ſelves to our utmoſt for; as we ſee there is any hope, or probability to attain it. We do alſo confeſs, <hi>that the lives and manners of diſſolute perſons (and how many there are amongſt your ſelves of that ſort, you ſay you are but to too conſcious,</hi> as we do earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pray, that both you and we may be ſo ſenſible thereof, as that we may more truly and deeply lay it to heart) <hi>may,</hi> by a true loving accord, which yet is to be in the way of truth, <hi>with brotherly admonition and exhortation be reclaimed</hi> (and in which way their reformation is moſt deſirable) <hi>or by due cenſures corrected and amended,</hi> we not being willing, that ſuch ſharp Phyſick ſhould be applyed for any other end.

               <p>But whereas, to perſwade us to accept of the tearms of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by you propounded, you now do further add and ſay; <hi>That amongst our ſelves alſo, many (who returning to their Canonical Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, which they have ſworn to) may blot out the charge of Schiſme that lies upon them: and the Church of God be continued amongſt us, from age to age, to the end of the world, in a ſucceſſion of a lawfully ordained Miniſtry.</hi> We are far from being convinced by theſe Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and muſt take the liberty to ſpeak to them particularly, and fully, that ſo we may wipe off the Aſperſions, that thereby are caſt upon us, and the Church of God. The Arguments you here urge, are two; we ſhall ſpeak unto them both, and in their order.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) And here we ſhall ſpeak in the firſt place unto the charge of Schiſme, that you would faſten upon us; reſerving unto an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other <note place="margin">The imput<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion of Sch<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taken off.</note> place our Anſwer unto the charge of Perjury, where you do it more plainly and expreſly, though here you might intend to inſinuate it. But as touching that of Schiſme, you plainely declare, <hi>That ſuch Miniſters</hi> (and of this ſort, you ſay, there are many amongſt us, though if we ſhould put you to prove this, you would never be able to make it out) <hi>as return not to that canonical Obedience</hi> (as you call it) <hi>which they were ſworn to</hi> (as you ſay) <hi>lye under the blot of Schiſme.</hi> But in your next Paper, you charge us with this more then once, and call it <hi>a Rent indeed, a Schiſme in the highest.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:119100:94"/>
But as to that blot of Schiſme, you would bring us, and the Miniſters of theſe Nations under, who return not to that Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, they ſometimes yielded to their ſeverall Dioceſans, we muſt ſpeak the more fully, becauſe the Charge is foul.</p>

And of this Schiſme <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Siqua eſt Eccleſia, quae fidem reſpuit, deſerenda eſt.</hi> 1. e. <hi>If there be any Church, that refuſeth the faith, it is to be forſaken.</hi> But as when we ſpeak of Schiſme, it is uſually taken in the worſe part, ſo it is the bad and ſinfull Shiſme, that is here ſpoken of. But thus alſo it is ſometimes taken generally, for any diviſion in the Church, that is unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable; and ſo it comprehends alſo Hereſie. And ſo the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:119100:94"/>
words Hereſie and Schiſme are ſometimes uſed in the ſame ſenſe, 1 Cor. 11. 19. <hi>For there muſt needs be Hereſies, or Schiſmes, or Sects, that thoſe that are approved, may be made manifeſt among them. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though</hi> ſtrictly Hereſie be oppoſed unto Faith, and Schiſme unto Charity. And this leads us to ſhew, what Schiſme is, taken ſtrictly and properly, which in brief may be thus deſcribed. <hi>Schiſme is a diſſolution or breach of that union, that ought to be amongſt Christians, conſenting together in the ſame Faith.</hi> And becauſe this breach of Union doth chiefly appear, in denying or refuſing Communion with the Church, in the uſe of Gods publick Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, therefore that kind of ſeparation is by a kind of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular appropriation, truly and rightly called Schiſme. Thus much for the opening the nature of Schiſme. Now becauſe you here charge us with it, we muſt needs tell you, the charge is great. For Schiſme truly and properly ſo called, and as it is taken in the worſer part, is a very hurtfull, dangerous, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious evil: The Apoſtle warned to take heed of it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned it in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. <hi>V.</hi> 10. 11, 12, 13. It is a work of the fleſh, and therefore the Apoſtle proves the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians to be carnall, becauſe of the diviſions, that were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 3, 4. It is a great offence againſt Chriſts being a rending of the Unity of his myſtical Body. It is a wrong unto the Church, whoſe peace is thereby diſturbed: and to the Members of the Church, their edification being thereby hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. And to conclude, Schiſme opens the door unto Hereſie, into which it doth oftentimes degenerate, and ſo makes way to ſeparation from Chriſt. And therefore you here charging us to lye under the blot of Schiſme, untill Epiſcopacy be againe admitted of, and there be a returning to that Obedience, that formerly hath been given to the Biſhops, ſhould have produced ſome Arguments for the making out your Charge. But here you are wholly ſilent, and think it ſufficient to inſinuate this ſo high a Charge, without giving any reaſons to convince us of our guiltineſſes. As if we muſt preſently without reaſon judge our ſelves, becauſe you accuſe us.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Yet becauſe ſome may be ready to take the matter upon truſt, and, except we purge our ſelves from this Crime, by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomething for our ſelves, conclude we are guilty, becauſe
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:119100:95"/>
you ſay ſo; we ſhall therefore in the ſecond place offer to the Reader theſe following conſiderations, that we may thereby clear our ſelves from this foul aſperſion.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) That though Epiſcopacy be never reſtored and neither we, nor any other Miniſters in this Land, return to that Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall Obedience, that hath formerly been yielded, yet ſtill both we and they may continue in Communion with the ſame Church of <hi>England,</hi> that we held Communion with during the continuance of Epiſcopacy, and with which we alſo do hold communion in all the Ordinances of Gods Worſhip, Word, Sacraments, and Prayer. This in the beginning of this Paper you do not deny, for you there ſpeak of us, as <hi>Brethren of one and the ſame Church and Fellowſhip.</hi> And we know not, what other Church you mean, but the Church of <hi>England;</hi> ſome of you, that are the Subſcribers of this Paper, not being Members of the particular Church at <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> nor any of you acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging, or owning our Presbyterian Claſſicall Church or Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociation. And therefore you here take us to be of the ſame Church of <hi>England</hi> with your ſelves, and confeſs, that we are in fellowſhip with it, notwithſtanding Epiſcopacy be taken away; and which is that, which we our ſelves do conſtantly profeſs.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) That that Epiſcopacy that was ſubmitted to by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of this Land of later times, was burthenſome and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous: It ſpoyled the Paſtors of that power; which of right did belong unto them, and which they did not onely anciently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe (as Doctor <hi>

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:119100:95"/>
with his blood.</hi> All which power the Paſtors were deprived of during the prevalency of Epiſcopacy, the Keys of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heaven being taken out of their hands, they having neither power to caſt out of the Church the vileſt of Offenders, that were often kept in againſt their minds; nor any power to reſtore into the Churches Communion, ſuch as had been never ſo unjuſtly excommunicated, though of the beſt of their Flock. And ſo that Epiſcopacy, that formerly was ſubmitted unto, was a plain and manifeſt uſurpation upon the Paſtors Office and Authority; was very oppreſſive and grievous unto the Church and injurious to her Communion: and whereupon it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that there is no breach of that Union, which ought to be maintained in the Church; by not admitting of it again, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Churches peace; the power, that of right belongs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Paſtors, and the Priviledges of the Members, are all bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſecured, in the abſence, then in the preſence of it.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) That however both godly Conformiſts as well as Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſts, did groan under the burthenſomneſs of it, yet <hi>in licitis &amp; honest is,</hi> they ſubmitted and yielded Obedience to it, whilſt it continued eſtabliſhed by the Laws of the Land; And that out of reſpect to the peace of the Church, although they did not thereby take themſelves obliged, to forbeare the uſe of any lawfull means, for their deliverance from that bondage, as opportunity was offered. And hereupon they petitioned the Parliament of late for an abolition of it, as had been formerly deſired in the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and King <hi>James;</hi> as when other Laws have been found to be inconvenient and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous, it was never accounted any diſturbance of the civil peace, to remonſtrate the grievouſneſs of ſuch Laws to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, that they might be aboliſhed.</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) Let it alſo be further weighed, that that Epiſcopacy, to which you would perſwade us by this Argument to return, is now aboliſhed and taken away by the Authority of Parliament, as appears by the Acts and Ordinances for that purpoſe. (See them cited in our Animadverſions on your next Paper, <hi>Sect.</hi> 4.) And therefore both the Biſhops as ſuch, and that Superiority, which they challenged and exerciſed over the Miniſters in this Land, are dead in Law; and ſo there can be no guilt of Schiſme
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:119100:96"/>
lying on the Miniſters in this Land, for not returning to that Canonicall Obedience, that is not hereupon any longer due: or for not ſubmitting themſelves to that power and juriſdiction, that is extinct. There is the greater ſtrength in this conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if it be obſerved</p>
               <p n="1">1. That whatever Juriſdiction the Dioceſan Biſhops did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe over Presbyters, they did obtain onely by the Law of the Land, and Canon of the Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Parliament did lawfully take away that Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from them, and had therein the concurrence of a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend and learned Aſſembly of Divines.</p>
               <p>The firſt of theſe Propoſitions is clear upon this conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the Scripture makes a Biſhop and a Presbyter all one.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, thoſe that are over them; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, thoſe that rule well; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, thoſe that rule. And for power to Ordain, we may ſee its plain from 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 14. where <hi>Timothy</hi> is charged not to neglect the Gift, that was in him, which was given him by Propheſie, with the laying on of the hands of the Presbytery. This Text you your ſelves tell us, in your next Paper, <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. is underſtood by the Greek Fathers, as <hi>Ignatius, Chryſoſtome, Theodoret, Theophylact, Oecumenius,</hi> and others, and ſome few of the Latines alſo, <hi>Of the company of Presbyters,</hi> i. e. <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:119100:96"/>
who lay hands on the new made Biſhops, or Prieſts.</hi> But from theſe ſeveral Texts thus urged, it is very manifeſt, that the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture makes a Biſhop and a Presbyter both one, or one and the ſame order of Miniſtry. And hereupon it follows, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Juriſdiction the Dioceſan Biſhops exerciſed over Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, they had it not by Divine Right, but obtained it onely by the Law of the Land, and Canon of the Church. And thus the firſt Propoſition is clear.</p>
               <p>We now come to make good the ſecond. And that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament did lawfully take away the Juriſdiction and whole Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Dioceſan Biſhops, is proved from the grounds already layd. For this Juriſdiction of theirs above Presbyters, did not belong unto them by Divine Right; we having proved that the Scripture makes a Biſhop and a Presbyter to be both one. And therefore the Parliament, that by Law gave them their power, might, ſeeing juſt cauſe for it, by Law take it away. They had alſo juſt reaſon for to take it away, in regard of the oppreſſiveneſs and burthenſomneſs of it, both to Miniſters and People, to this whole Church and Nation, as hath been proved before. And therefore what they herein did, was juſtly, yea, piouſly, and prudently done, and for which the Church of God in this Land, both Miniſters and People, do for the preſent, and will for the future, ſee great cauſe to bleſs God, for many Generations.</p>
               <p>And that they had the concurrence herein of a reverend and learned Aſſembly of Divines, is clear from their Exhortation annexed to the Ordinance of Lords and Commons aſſembled in Parliament, with Inſtructions for taking the League and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in the Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> and Dominion of <hi>Wales.</hi> In this Exhortation of the Aſſembly of Divines, in anſwer to ſome Objections, they apprehended, might be made againſt the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the Covenant, they thus expreſs themſelves. <q>If it be ſayd, for the extirpation of Prelacy, to wit, the whole Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiall Government (ſtanding as yet by the known Laws of the Kingdome) is new and unwarrantable. This will appear to all impartiall underſtandings (though new) to be not onely warrantable, but neceſſary; if they conſider (to omit what ſome ſay, that this Government was never formally
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:119100:97"/>
eſtabliſhed by any Laws of this Kingdome at all) that the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry life and ſoul thereof is already taken from it, by an Act paſſed this preſent Parliament, ſo as (like <hi>Jezabels</hi> Carkaſs, of which no more was left but the Skull, the Feet, and the Palmes of her hands) nothing of Juriſdiction remains, but what is precarious in them, and voluntary in thoſe, who ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit unto them: That their whole Government is at beſt but a humane Conſtitution, and ſuch as is found and adjudged by both Houſes of Parliament (in which the Judgment of the whole Kingdome is involved and declared) not onely very perjudicial to the civil State, but a great hinderance alſo to the perfect reformation of Religion: Yea, who knoweth it not to be too much an Enemy thereunto, and deſtructive to the power of Godlineſs, and pure adminiſtration of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Chriſt; which moved the well-affected, almoſt throughout this Kingdome, long ſince to petition this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament (as hath been deſired before in the reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and King <hi>James)</hi> for a total abolition of the ſame: And then a little after. And as for theſe Clergy-men, who pretend that they (above all other) cannot covenant to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate that Government, becauſe they have (as they ſay) taken a ſolemn Oath, to obey the Biſhops <hi>in licitis &amp; honeſtis:</hi> they can tell, if they pleaſe, that they that have ſworne Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Laws of the Land, are not thereby prohibited from endeavouring by all lawfull means the abolition of thoſe Laws, when they prove inconvenient or miſchievous. And yet if there ſhould any Oath be found, into which any Miniſters, or others have entred, not warranted by the Laws of God and the Land, in this caſe they muſt teach themſelves and others, that ſuch Oathes call for repentance, not perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy in them</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus far the Aſſembly of Divines in their Exhortation, for the taking the ſolemne League and Covenant, and which we have thought requiſite to tranſcribe, that ſo it may appear, how fully they concurred with the Parliament in what they did, touching the abolition of Epiſcopacy, as it doth alſo confirme by their Teſtimony, ſeverall things, that have been mentioned by us, wherein the Reader may perceive their concurrence in
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:119100:97"/>
Judgment with us. From all which it is clear, that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Dioceſan Biſhops did but obtaine that Juriſdiction, they exerciſed over Presbyters, by the Law of the Land and Canon of the Church: The Parliament finding this Government of Epiſcopacy to be very oppreſſive to this Church, <hi>A great hinderance to the perfect Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Religion, and prejudiciall to the civill State,</hi> they might both lawſully and laudably, being therein alſo backed with the advice of a reverend and learned Synod, take it away. And hence it will follow, that if the Miniſters of this Land, for ſevering themſelves from the Biſhops, and with-drawing their Canonicall Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience from them, as ſome ſpeake (the Parliament according to the reverend Synod, having before ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away from them all that Juriſdiction over Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, that did belong unto them) muſt needs be accuſed of Schiſme, <hi>It is a good Schiſme, yea, a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Schiſme,</hi> (to uſe the words, that <hi>Gerhard</hi> did, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending the Proteſtants with-drawing from the Pope and the Church of <hi>Rome)</hi> that they will be found to be guilty of. The blot whereof, as it is not to be much regarded, ſo it is eaſily wiped off; and as we think it is already done, in the Eyes of all impartiall and unbyaſſed Readers, by theſe Conſiderations, which we have layd down.</p>
               <p>We have onely one thing more to add, which is the third generall Head we offer to the Reader here, before we leave this firſt Argument, with which you would perſwade us, to returne againe to our former Yoke of Bondag.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) For we offer it to the conſideration of all impartiall men, whether conſidering what hath been ſpoken touching the nature of Schiſme in the generall; and how lawfully and laudably the Parliament did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſh Epiſcopacy, and how they paſſed by Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance the forme of Church-Government, <hi>Anno</hi> 1648. eſtabliſhing the Presbyterian in roome of the Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:119100:98"/>
and that how it was ſet up in this County by their Authority; If they but obſerve, what your actings have been, and what your expreſſions are in your Papers, they will not thereupon ſee juſt cauſe to impute Schiſme (ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the worſt part, and as it is taken moſt uſually) unto you, who have been ſo forward, though without reaſon, to faſten this blot upon us? But we are ſure, during the prevalency of Epiſcopacy, thoſe that were not guilty of any ſuch diſturbance of the peace of the Church, by any ſuch boiſterous Ventings of the Diſtempers of their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, as you are, were counted and called by the Prelates Schiſmaticks. And from which Aſperſion, though ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry of thoſe (being peaceable and godly, however Non-conformiſts) were free, yet you being very unlike them, are not thereby quit.</p>
               <p>But we have now done with the firſt of thoſe Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, we promiſed to ſpeak to particularly, whereby you would perſwade us to admit againe of Epiſcopacy; and hope we have ſayd to it that, which is ſufficient.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) We therefore now come to the ſecond, wherein <note place="margin">The being of the Church &amp; a lawfully Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry ſecured in the want of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopacy.</note> you ſtill riſe higher, for therein you inſinuate a thing of a farre greater and more dangerous conſequence, if Epiſcopacy be not reſtored. For you intimate, that it is neceſſary, <hi>That the Church of God may be continued amongſt us, from Age to Age, to the end of the World, in a ſucceſſion of a lawfull ordained Miniſtry.</hi> And in your next Paper, you falling foule upon us, and charging us with a rent indeed, a Schiſme in the higheſt; you add, <hi>which is not ſatisfied but with the utter overthrow of the Church, from whom they rent.</hi> Here you lay a great ſtreſs upon Epiſcopacy; and ſuch an one, as none of our true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Divines, that defend the truth of our own and other reformed Churches againſt the Papiſts, would ever have layd upon it. But here two things are hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which we ſhall ſeverally examine.</p>
               <p n="1">1. You intimate that by the taking away of Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy, <hi>the Church is overthrowne;</hi> it cannot be <hi>continued
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:119100:98"/>
amongſt us from Age to Age, to the end of the World,</hi> except Epiſcopacy be reſtored.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But yet there is a further Implication, <hi>ſc.</hi> That there cannot be a Succeſſion of a lawfull ordained Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry (which Succeſſion yet you intimate to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the being of the Church) if we have not Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops againe, that may Ordain.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) Unto the firſt of theſe we ſhall anſwer, after we have premiſed a diſtinction touching the word <hi>Church.</hi> For either the Church of God amongſt us (which you here ſpeak of) is taken eſſentially, for that part of the Catholick viſible Church, which in regard of the place of its abode in this Land, is called the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> as the ſeverall parts of the Sea (which yet is but one) receive their Denomination from the Shoares they waſh. Or elſe you take the word <hi>Church,</hi> for a Miniſteriall Church, or for the Church repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſative, as it is taken, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 27. This premiſed we anſwer;</p>
               <p>If you take the word <hi>Church</hi> in the former ſenſe, your Poſition is very groſs, no other then this, that for want of Biſhops, the whole Church of <hi>England</hi> is at preſent overthrowne; and that there is no way of recovery of it, but by the reſtoring of them; and ſo in the mean ſeaſon it is no Church, with whom we may ſafely hold Communion: which layes a Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for ſeparation from it, and of Apoſtaſie unto <hi>Rome,</hi> where Biſhops may be had. We ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to this ſay no more, but onely mind you of what is well obſerved by Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> out of B. <hi>Jewell,</hi> in the defence of the Agreement of the <hi>Worceſterſhire</hi> Miniſters, <hi>Page</hi> 58. where he hath theſe words; <q>B. <hi>Jewell</hi> in his defence of the Apology (Authoriſed to be kept in all Churches) Part 2. <hi>Page</hi> 131. [Neither doth the Church of <hi>England</hi> depend on them, whom you ſo often call Apoſtates, as if our Church were no Church without them.</q>

               <p>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:119100:99"/>
                  <q>They are no Apoſtates Mr. <hi>H &amp;c.</hi> Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing if there were not one, neither of them, nor of us, left alive, yet would not the whole Church of <hi>England</hi> flee to <hi>Lovaine.

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But if you take the word Church for a Miniſteriall or Organized Church, we oppoſe your Poſition with theſe following Arguments.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) That which we have already proved, <hi>ſc.</hi> That a Biſhop and a Presbyter are all one in Scripture ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation, will neceſſarily inferre, that the being of a Miniſteriall or Organized Church, doth not depend on the continuance or reſtauration of Biſhops, taking them for ſuch, as are ſuperiour to Presbyters, either in regard of Order or Juriſdiction. For though theſe be never reſtored, yet Presbyters being continued (that yet are Biſhops in Scripture ſenſe) the Organized and Miniſteriall Church of Chriſt is fufficiently ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red againſt the danger of periſhing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But by the Tenent, you here hold forth, you do very uncharitably unchurch the beſt reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches throughout the World; The Proteſtant Churches of <hi>France, Scotland,</hi> the <hi>Low countries,</hi> and <hi>Geneva,</hi> muſt all be p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t out of the number of free Organized and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſteriall Churches; and their Miniſters muſt (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they admit not the Biſhops; that you are for) be accounted no lawfull Miniſters: Yea, you here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine very undutifully unchurch your Mother the Church of <hi>England,</hi> if ſhe reſtore not Epiſcopacy; and herein gratifie the Papiſts no little, that vilifie her and other reformed Churches, as no true Churches,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:119100:99"/>
and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ry out againſt their Miniſters as no lawfull Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. But bleſſed be God, both the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and other reformed Churches and their Miniſters, have had, and ſtill have better Advocates, and more dutifull Sonnes, then you herein approve your ſelves to be, to plead their Cauſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By this Tenent alſo it will follow, That all the Ordinances, that are diſpenſed in theſe Churches, are null and void. Their Baptiſme is no Baptiſme: The Sacrament of the Lords Supper Adminiſtred amongſt them, is no Sacrament; and the like muſt be ſaid of all the Ordinances, that are diſpenſed in our Church, by ſuch as were not ordained by Biſhops; and ſo it makes them as to outward Church-Priviledges no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then meer Heathens; and hereupon it miniſters occaſion of endleſs Doubts and Scruples unto the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of thoſe Churches, of queſtioning the validity of their Baptiſme, and whether they ought not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized? which doubts alſo by your Tenent are occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned alſo to all thoſe among your ſelves, that were baptized by ſuch Miniſters, as were not Ordained by Biſhops. Thus you ſee, how you lay the Foundation of Anabaptiſme, which yet you would ſeem to be zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Oppoſers of.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Add hereunto, that hence it will unavoidably fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; That you muſt not hold any Communion with theſe Churches, nor ſuch Congregations in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> where theſe Ordinances are diſpenſed by ſuch, as were not Ordained by Biſhops; their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, according to your Doctrine, being not lawfull Miniſters; and for the Ordinance diſpenſed by them null and void. And here is a <hi>Rent indeed, a rent in the higheſt</hi> (to uſe your owne expreſſions) from which our old Epiſcopall Divines, that were ſound Proteſtants, would never have excuſed you, no nor Doctor <hi>Vſher,</hi> with whom in ſome things you profeſs to cloſe. For however he is repreſented by Doctor <hi>Bernard,</hi> to have
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:119100:100"/>
held, that a Biſhop had Superiority in degree above a Presbyter by Apoſtolicall Inſtitution, <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Vide</hi> pa. 128. of Dr. <hi>Bernards</hi> late Book. * <hi>Vide</hi> pa. 126.</note> and had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed himſelfe ſharply enough in his Letter to Doctor <hi>Bernard, Touching the Ordination made by ſuch Presbyters, as had ſevered themſelves from Biſhops,</hi> yet a little after ſpeaking of the Churches of the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> * he ſayth: <q>For the teſtifying his Communion with theſe Churches (which he profeſſeth to love and honour as true Members of the Church Univerſall) he ſhould with like affection receive the bleſſed Sacrament at the hands of the Dutch Miniſters, if he were in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as he ſhould at the hands of the French Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters if he were in <hi>Charenton.</hi>
                  </q> By which you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive (however he held thoſe Churches defective in Government for want of Biſhops) yet he neither up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this account doth unchurch them, nor would have refuſed Communion with them, as you, by what you do here hold forth, muſt needs do.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Nay laſtly, hence it will follow, that when all the Biſhops in theſe Lands, and thoſe that were Ordained by them, ſhall be dead, if there be no Biſhops to be found in any other reformed Churches, nor Miniſters, that were Ordained by them, a retreat back againe to <hi>Rome</hi> muſt be ſounded, that ſo we might have a lawfull Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained Miniſtry and a Church: which yet cannot be, but by owning the Pope as the Head of the Church and renouncing the Proteſtant Religion; as in the mean ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon great advantage is given to the Popiſh Emiſſaries to enſnare the weak by ſuch a dangerous Inſinuation, as this is, <hi>ſc.</hi> That for want of Biſhops, or that when all the Biſhops are dead and thoſe, that were Ordained by them, we have amongſt us neither Church nor Miniſtery, nor Ordinances, and thus muſt continue to the end of the World, except we returne to <hi>Rome,</hi> and which they will not be wanting to tell them. But if you had conſulted Biſhop <hi>Jewell,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Downame,</hi> Doctor <hi>Feild,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Davenant,</hi> Mr. <hi>Maſon,</hi> and other Orthodox Epiſcopall
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:119100:100"/>
Divines in this Point, and weighed their Defences of the reformed Churches and Miniſtry againſt the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, you would have found, they would never have owned ſuch a dangerous and unſound Poſition, as the Argument, you here urge us with to admit againe of Epiſcopacy, doth imply. Neither do we believe, that they, if they were now alive, would judge, that you had here argued well for your Mother the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that hath her ſelfe alſo, ever ſince the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, even during the time of Epiſcopacy, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged the reformed Churches of <hi>France, Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Low-countries, Geneva,</hi> to be true Churches of Chriſt, and hath given them the right hand of Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip as Siſter Churches, and owned their Miniſters, Ordained without Biſhops by Presbyters onely, to be true Miniſters.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) We now come to the ſecond thing implyed in this your ſecond Argument, with which you would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade us to admit of Epiſcopacy, which is, as we have ſayd before, that if it be not reſtored, there cannot be a ſucceſſion of a lawfully Ordained Miniſtry. Which ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion yet you ſeem to judge to be neceſſary unto the continuance of the Church of God amongſt us. Here two things are implyed:</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) The firſt whereof is, that a Succeſſion is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the very being of the Church, and of a lawfully Ordained Miniſtry. And ſo 1. You do hereby ſtrengthen the hands of the Papiſts, who make the Succeſſion of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Paſtors without any interruption from the Apoſtles, to be a Mark of the true Church, although they are therein oppoſed generally by our Proteſtant Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines. The Condition of the Church being many times ſuch, that the Succeſſion of publick Teachers and Paſtors is interrupted. Doctor <hi>Sutlive</hi> ſaith well, <hi>In externa</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib. de Eccleſia</hi> cap. 18. fo. 123.</note> 
                  <hi>ſucceſſione, quam &amp; haeretici ſaepe habent, &amp; Orthodoxi non ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent, nihil eſt momenti.</hi> 2. You do alſo hereby Miniſter occaſion of ſuch ſcruples unto private Chriſtians, as you
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:119100:101"/>
will never be able ſatisfactorily to reſolve. For ſuppoſe one on this ground queſtions the truth of his Baptiſme, <hi>ſc.</hi> Becauſe he doth not know whether he was baptized by one that was Ordained by a Biſhop, who himſelfe alſo was Ordained by a former true Biſhop, and he by a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, untill the Succeſſion be carried on as high, as that we are brought to ſuch a Biſhop, that was ordained by one of the Apoſtles. How will you be able, making this Succeſſion neceſſary to the continuing of the Church, and a lawfully Ordained Miniſtry, to reſolve the ſcruples of ſuch an one? What Church-Story ſhall be able to reſolve the doubts that may be moved on this occaſion? Or on what grounds (holding the neceſſity of this Succeſſion for the continuance of the Church, and a lawfully Ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Miniſtry) will you be able to ſatisfie the Conſcience of ſuch, as may be ſtumbled?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Nay, will not this Aſſertion give occaſion to ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry, to queſtion all Churches, Miniſtry, and Ordinances, and ſo to turn Seekers; the Grounds you lay down, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them occaſion to queſtion the truth of our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Miniſtry, and Ordinances.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Neither ſhall the beſt and ableſt Miniſters, that are already entred into that Calling, or ſuch as are to enter into it, be able on your Principles in this particular, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſatisfie their owne Conſciences touching the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of their calling, or be able to juſtifie and defend it againſt thoſe, that ſhall call it in queſtion But our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Divines have more ſure Grounds, on which to juſtifie our Churches, Miniſtry, and Ordinances, and to ſatisfie their own and their peoples Conſciences concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, then what you inſinuate</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) The ſecond thing that is further implyed in this Argument, is that the Succeſſion of a lawfully Ordained Miniſtry to the end of the World, doth depend upon Epiſcopacy, which is not true. There was a time, when Biſhops had no Superiority above Presbyters; a Biſhop and a Presbyter in Scripture ſenſe being all one, as hath

been proved before. And though this Superiority ſhould never be reſtored unto them, yet the Succeſſion of a lawfully Ordained Miniſtry might be by the means of Presbyters Ordaining Presbyters. And thus we ſay it was continued, not onely in the dayes of Epiſcopacy, (though not without the mixture of ſome corruption cleaving to the Ordination then in uſe) the Biſhops (notwithſtanding their uſurped Superiority above their fellow Brethren) being themſelves alſo Presbyters, and ſo their Ordination valid in that reſpect (and which we have conſtantly maintained againſt thoſe of the ſeparation) but alſo in the darkeſt times of Popery, and that our Miniſtry <hi>deſcended to us from Chriſt, through the Apoſtate Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>but not from the Apoſtate Church of</hi> Rome; as our reverend Brethren of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>London</hi> do well expreſs it, in their <hi>Jus divinum miniſterii Evangelici,</hi> where they do ſolidly and learnedly prove, <hi>That the Miniſtry, which is an Inſtitution of Christ paſſing to us through</hi> Rome, <hi>is not made null and void, no more then the Scriptures, Sacraments or any other Goſpel Ordinance, which we now enjoy, and which do alſo deſcend to us from the Apoſtles, through the Romiſh Church.</hi> And concerning which, if any one do doubt, we referre him unto the Book for his ſatisfaction <hi>Part</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. where (as they well ſay)—this great truth ſo neceſſary to be knowne in theſe dayes, is fully diſcuſſed, and made out.</p>
               <p>We have now at length done with both thoſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, we promiſed to ſpeak to particularly, with which you urged us to accept of the Propoſall, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the taking in the Biſhops: wherein we have been the longer (though perhaps this Diſcourſe may by you be accounted tedious) that ſo we might wipe off the foule aſperſion of Schiſme, that we are therein charged with, and likewiſe ſhew, that the Church of God and a lawfully Ordained Miniſtry, are ſufficiently ſecured in the non-admiſſion of Epiſcopacy; and which
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:119100:102"/>
we have alſo before proved, tends not to ſecure the Church or Miniſtry, but to inthrall both, and bring them under bondage.</p>
               <p>And now as touching the next Argument you uſe; we are ſure there is no need of Epiſcopacy, that the <hi>Word of God might be firmly fixed among us;</hi> but rather we ſay, That the danger <hi>of its removall Weſtward,</hi> hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to you lately by one of the reverend Paſtors of the Church of <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> would by the admitting of it, be encreaſed; conſidering how many godly, painefull Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters were ſilenced by the Prelates, and driven into <hi>America</hi> of later times; and ſo hereupon there would be danger, that the Word of God, that is now on the <hi>Tiptoes</hi> (ready to remove, if God of his infinite mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy prevent it not) ſhould preſently take its flight from us and be gone, being ſent unto a people, that would bring forth better Fruit, then we have done; or then this will be found to be, to take in Prelacy againe, and that in time of peace, after we had in the dayes of our Affliction, according to our ſolemne Covenant, caſt it forth.</p>
               <p>Now whereas you add, that you ſhould by our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting of your Motions, have <hi>been happily freed from the trouble of any further rejoynder unto our Anſwer. Which otherwiſe</hi> (as you ſay) <hi>you muſt do, amongſt other conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable reaſons, to take off our Government, from that eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Authority, upon the proof whereof the moſt conſiderable part, as to the bulke, of our Anſwer, doth inſiſt.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. You here ſay, <hi>That the moſt conſiderable part of our Anſwer, as to the bulke, doth inſiſt upon the proof of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhment of our Government by Authority; and this you ſay againe and againe in your next Paper, though without any ſhew of truth:</hi> as when we come to examine that Paper, we ſhall there manifeſt.</p>

But we ſhould have judged you a great deale <hi>more happy,</hi> if you had never put your ſelves upon the trouble of ſuch a Rejoynder (as you call it) conſidering what unquietneſs and diſtemper of Spirit you do there diſcover, as every Reader may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily conceive, that if from our Anſwer to your firſt Paper, you <hi>conceived ſome hopes of an amicable and friendly agreement of differences,</hi> and as you profeſs in your Advertiſement to the Reader, you did; you had no juſt cauſe given you to conceive from <hi>thoſe verball exceptions againſt the laſt paſſage of your Reply, that we gave you,</hi> as you there ſpeak; nor from the

                     <head>The Animadverſions of the firſt Claſs within the Province of Lancaſter, on this paper.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. FIrſt, There was no reaſon, why (though our anſwer was large (which you complain of) ſeeing it was in order to, and neceſſary for your ſatisfaction) that ſhould hinder your acknowledgement of our civillity towards you; eſpecially conſidering thoſe ſharp reflections on us, and on our Government in your firſt paper, (which in your ſecond you do not deny) and which miniſtred unto us occaſion of provocation; but we were reſolved not to anſwer you in your own kind, as through the grace of God we hope (though we muſt deal faithfully with you) we ſhall keep our ſelves ſtill from returning railing for railing; notwithſtanding in this paper you deal farre more uncivilly and unchriſtianly with us, as the Reader will perceive.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, But whereas you acknowledge our civillity only ſo farre, as it related unto you, we cannot ſee any reaſon for this reſtriction, we having not dealt uncivilly with any, that we had occaſion to mention or quote in our anſwer.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Neither did we give any occaſion, by the anſwer we gave you to your ſecond paper, to conceive that we intended not an amicable union, and compoſure of differences, according to our profeſſion of our cordial and hearty deſires; although (we muſt needs confeſs) whatever your hopes were, we did not apprehend any great likelyhood of a cloſure with you, or that you had reaſon ſo to conceive, upon the termes you propounded in your ſecond paper, as we have ſaid already in our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to it; except you thought we might be courted out of our principles, upon your earneſt entreaty, without any grounds and reaſons at all.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, We cannot but wonder that you ſhould ſay with any qualification, <hi>that you condiſcend to come to our terms;</hi> except it be, <hi>as it were,</hi> to come to our termes, to
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:119100:104"/>
propound in order unto peace, What? in that very place, where we profeſs our ſelves ſo willing and deſirous of u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, we had expreſly cautioned againſt, as being things we could not in conſcience yeeld unto. But when you ſpeak of your condeſcenſion, we cannot but thereby con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive your meaning to be this, that if you grant preaching Presbyters any power in Eccleſiaſtical matters, and to have deciſive votes in Synods (where the Biſhops are to be the ſuperintendents and perpetual moderatours, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the propoſals of Dr. <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher)</hi> you think you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcend very farre. And upon this and other grounds, we have cauſe to fear, if the ruling Elders were removed, and you ſhould come to be cenſured by the preaching Presbyters, your exceptions then would be as much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them in ſuch a caſe, as againſt the ruling Elders now; and that then you would cry up the Biſhops, as having the ſolitary power of juriſdiction, and that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed not to other Miniſters to meddle therein at all.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, When mentioning our profeſſions cordially to deſire peace, (which you will have to be but a <hi>pretending</hi> to it only) you ſay, <hi>Oh that there had been ſuch a heart in us!</hi> We muſt needs tell you, that we can approve our hearts to him that is the ſearcher of them, that there was then, and is ſtill, a cordial deſire of peace and union, with all that are truly godly and orthodox throughout the Land, however differing from us in ſome points, touching Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline and Government; and do heartily wiſh, that you cloſed with us in thoſe deſires, as cordially and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily as we do. But we hereby perceive, that except we have an heart for Epiſcopacy (condeſcended by you for the preſent to be moderated) and to throw out the ruling Elders (even to the forcing of our conſciences againſt the Scriptures we urged in our anſwer, for the divine right of their office, and againſt the Scriptural arguments thence urged, to which we referred you, (though by you ſleighted) and againſt the reaſons alſo we urged in our anſwer, where we cautioned againſt moderate Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:119100:105"/>
never ſo much as attempted to be anſwered by you) you judge us to have no hearts for peace.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, Whereas you ſay, our <hi>diſcourſe concerning the civill ſanction of our Presbyterian Government</hi> (which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the authority that awarranted all that was in that paper, we publiſhed in our ſeveral Congregations, and whatever we have acted in the exerciſe of that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the firſt to the laſt, ſince it was ſet up) was <hi>needleſs,</hi> we leave it to the Reader to judge of, when he ſhall conſider, that in your firſt paper you told us, of <hi>our making Laws and Edicts, and publiſhing them openly in the Church, for all to obey upon pain of Excommunication, contrary to the Laws in force—and that it concerned us to look unto it, whether we had not run our ſelves into a praemunire.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Seventhly, But it ſeems you count that diſcourſe alſo <hi>tedious;</hi> though it was neceſſary, both for our own vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dincation, and to give you full and particular ſatisfaction, touching the rules preſcribed unto us in the forme of Church-Government to walk by; beſides that this fair manner of dealing with you, in bringing to your hand, what we judged you might never have enquired after, gave you the opportunity to have excepted againſt us, for tranſgreſſing our rule, if you had any thing to have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged againſt us in that reſpect: But perhaps the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning of any Ordinances of Parliament, and rules there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in expreſſed for the Presbyterian Government, was that which was tedious to you, and which we have ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for to think; and therefore afterward you endeavour (though you performe not what you undertake) to take them all away, and utterly to nullifie all Ordinances of Parliament whatſoever.</p>
                     <p>Eightly, You judge alſo, that we quickly forget our ſelves, when we ſaid in our anſwer, <hi>our leiſure would not permit us to spend time about impertinencies, and yet preſently fall upon alleadging of ſundry Orders and Ordinances of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> but theſe were not produced by us <hi>to prove, that the Presbyterian Government was eſtabliſhed by the Law of the Land,</hi> but to give you ſome account how the ſetting up of the
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:119100:105"/>
Presbyterian Government in this County, the dividing it into ſeveral Claſſes, the making thoſe Claſſes into a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, and appointing this Claſs to be the firſt, was all done by Authority of Parliament: this being the inference that we made from our recital <note n="*" place="margin">See the firſt Section of it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the cloſe.</note> of the Orders and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Parliament, that were mentioned in our anſwer, and which was occaſioned by your ſelves, who having intituled us in your firſt paper, <hi>The firſt Claſs at Mancheſter, within the Province of Lancaſter,</hi> then preſently added, <hi>Give us leave to ſalute you in your own terms:</hi> We judged you might be ignorant of the particular Orders and Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces touching what concerned this Province of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> and this Claſs in particular, in the particulars above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, though you might have ſeen ſome Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the general, for the Presbyterian Government, and which we believe any indifferent Reader will diſcern, are diſtinct things; as the Parliament alſo in paſſing them, diſtinguiſhed them; and therefore you ſhould not have dealt ſo diſingeniouſly with us, as to have accounted the diſcourſe impertinent, which was neceſſary for your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, if you were ignorant: If you knowing theſe Orders and Ordinances, would yet have this diſcourſe impertinent, notwithſtanding your jerking us, for calling our ſelves the firſt Claſſis within the Province of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> (which terms we told you <hi>we gave not to our ſelves, till the Parliament had firſt given them us)</hi> we leave it to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what to judge of it.</p>
                     <p>Ninthly, Here is alſo another ſtrange aſſertion, when you ſay, <hi>it was no queſtion of yours, whether our Government be eſtabliſhed by the Law of the Land;</hi> when as in your firſt paper, in the words thereof recited even now, you told us of <hi>our making Laws and Edicts, and publiſhing them contrary to the Laws in force, and queſtioning whether we had not run our ſelves into a praemunire.</hi> Doubtleſs if our Government be eſtabliſhed by Ordinance of Parliament, and that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance awarrant us for whatever was publiſhed by us in the paper, and yet that be aſſerted by you to be contrary to the Laws in force, it muſt needs be a queſtion of yours,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:119100:106"/>
whether our Government be eſtabliſhed, by the Law of the Land; as it is that which afterward you go about to prove, that it wants the eſtabliſhment of Authority; and ſo how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you dare not tell the Juſtices of the Peace, that have acted on other Ordinances of Parliament (that yet are alſo null and void, if that we have acted on be) that they are not thereby ſufficiently ſecured againſt the danger of a praemunire; yet you dare tell us of this once and again, and yet alſo it be no queſtion of yours, whether our Church-Government be eſtabliſhed by the Law of the Land; but how contradictory theſe things are one unto another, we leave it to be judged of. As touching our <hi>ſtarting more doubts,</hi> then (as you ſay) <hi>we can aſſoyl,</hi> we ſhall have leiſure hereafter to examine, in the place where you have a mind to encounter us, and now ſhall follow you in the way you have choſen to go in. And ſo we come unto the next.</p>

But as in the Preface to theſe papers that you printed, you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate that we are <hi>men of low and cheap abilities;</hi> and in this paper do afterwards jeer and ſcoff at us, as perſons deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of all learning, as if you would monopolize (as all power and juriſdiction) ſo all learning, and make the ſame proper to your ſelves and your own party, (though we hope we have ſo much, as to fathom the depth of that which you would make ſome ſhew of) ſo here we have cauſe to fear, you had a mind to repreſent us, (and which is worſe, the Provincial Aſſembly too, and thoſe reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend and learned brethren, the Moderator and Scribe of it alſo) to be ſuch poor illiterate perſons, as did not well know how how to write good Engliſh.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, In your repreſenting what we ſaid touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſubmitting to Synods and Councils; you do it but by the halfes, (and ſo deal unfaithfully) never ſo much as mentioning what we had in our anſwer in the firſt place declared, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>our faith was not to be reſolved into the determination of any company of men on earth whatſoever, or to be built on the judgement of Synods and Councills,</hi> &amp;c. for which we gave our reaſons. And further we there ſaid, that (when you had ſaid in your firſt paper, that <hi>as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what you therein declare as your ſenſe and apprehenſions of ours that we publiſhed, you did not reſt in the judgement and determination of any general Concil contrary thereunto:)</hi> if your meaning therein was the ſame with what we had declared ours to be, you had not us differing from you. After we came to declare, in what reſpects they were to be reverenced; <hi>viz. as they were the ordinances of God, and in respect of their authoritative judgement,</hi> and that, in that reſpect they were to be ſubmitted to; in which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect we ſaid we ſubmitted our apprehenſions, in the caſe
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:119100:107"/>
propounded to the judgement of the Provincial Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. But to make this more plain, we proceeded to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh betwixt <hi>a private and publick judgement</hi> in matters of Religion, allowing the private to our ſelves and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who (we ſaid) were all of us to ſee with our own eyes, and judge concerning what is to be believed in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of this nature. Again we diſtinguiſhed the <hi>publick and authoritative judgement,</hi> into a <hi>concional</hi> (which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed (we ſaid) to every Miniſter, to whom the key of Doctrine was committed, by himſelf ſingly) and <hi>juridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal;</hi> which (we ſaid) belonged to Synods and Councils, who having the key of Diſcipline committed to them, were to enquire into, try, examine, cenſure, and judge of matters of Doctrine and Diſcipline authoritatively, (though tyed to the Word in ſuch proceedings) and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to cenſure offenders; and then we applyed this to our purpoſe, and ſaid that it was in this ſenſe, that we ſubmitted our apprehenſions, in the paper we publiſhed, to the judgement of the Provincial Aſſembly, and for which we urged our grounds; all which will be clear to the Reader, upon the peruſal of the ſecond Section of our anſwer: But you only mention this laſt branch, and ſay, we tell you <hi>of an authoritative judgement of Synods and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cills, and how we hoped when you had weigbed the matter better, you would not in this respect ſee cauſe to ſubmit, what you may publiſh as your own private judgements about matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, to the judgement of a general Council, ſuppoſe it might be had.</hi> But ſeeing, towards the cloſe of this Section, you profeſs, you are glad to hear us of the ſame mind with you, touching this ſubmiſſion to Synods and Councills; you ſhould not thus maimedly have repreſented out opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; conſidering how vaſtly different ours and yours is in this matter; as will appear from what hath been decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be ours, and what you declare to be yours in this Section, and which we ſhall manifeſt anon to the Reader.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, You ſeem here to abhorre the refuſal <hi>to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, what you have publiſhed or may publiſh as your own private
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:119100:108"/>
judgement, in matters of Religion, to the judgement of a general Council</hi> that hath been, or any that may be hereafter, and do complain, that <hi>we ſhould either our ſelves judge, or induce others to the perſwaſion of you, that you ſhould refuſe to ſubmit your judgement in the ſenſe declared.</hi> But here we muſt mind you, that the ſenſe we declared was, that there was to be a ſubmiſſion to them, in regard of their juridical authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; not that faith was to be built on their judgement; And in this latter you will be found to ſubmit too much; as if they ſhould determine againſt you, we fear in the former you would be found to ſubmit too little. We ſhall give the Reader our Reaſons for both, that we may not ſeem to wrong you, in faſtening upon you without ground, what perhaps, as we have expreſſed the matter, you may be ready to diſclaim.</p>
                     <p>For the firſt; You do in this very Section profeſs, <hi>as touching matters which are not ſo plainly ſet forth in the word of God, your willing ſubmiſſion to the judgement of a general Council;</hi> and hereafter in the ſixth Section of this Paper, you ſay, <hi>where there is a doubt or difficulty, the Church may expound the Scripture;</hi> although you grant what we ſaid, <hi>ſoil. that it is tyed to the rule of Gods words in ſuch proceedings, as Judges to the Law;</hi> though we do not ſee, it is lawfull for any private perſons to examine, whether in caſe of ſuch a doubt or difficulty, the Church hath given the right ſenſe of Scripture; but muſt (notwithſtanding any grounds, they may have from that Text, which the Church may expound, or other Texts of Scripture, to the contrary;) ſubmit their faith and belief in the caſe, to the Churches determination. For you there add and ſay, <hi>we are b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>und up by that,</hi> ſpeaking of the Churches ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, as you ſay, <hi>we are to thoſe caſes in the Law, which are the judgement and expoſition of the Judges, upon the dark places of the ſame: the Churches expoſition and practice,</hi> (as you there further ſay) <hi>is our rule in ſuch caſes, and the beſt rule too—and when there is a difference about interpretation of Scripture, it is to give way to private interpretation, and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nari fidei, to lord it over the faith of others,</hi> to utter any
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:119100:108"/>
other ſenſe of Scripture (which you there call <hi>the uttering of mens own fancies)</hi> then hath been <hi>delivered by our Forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> as you do more fully declare your ſelves in that place. From all which it follows, that however in this Section you ſay, <hi>in matters of faith, and ſuch articles, as are plainly warranted by Gods word, and conſtant practice of the Catholique Church, you refuſe to ſubmit your judgement to the judgement of a general Council;</hi> yet in matters of Religion, that are not ſo plainly ſet forth, you do; and to the Churches expoſition, where there is a doubt and difficulty, which is your rule, and the beſt rule too, and by which you are bound up; which what is it elſe, then to build your faith in ſuch caſes, upon their judgement, and ſo to ſubmit to them, as we ſaid, too much? And ſeeing, there is almoſt no point of faith, but it is controverted; if all ſuch points muſt be judged, ſuch matters, as about which there is doubt and difficulty, and not plainly ſet forth in Gods word; then in all ſuch caſes it muſt be the Churches expoſition of the Scriptures and practice (as you do inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate) that muſt be the rule by which you muſt be guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that on which in ſuch caſes your faith muſt be built; and which, when we come to the ſixth Section, we ſhall ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>w to be very unſound, and with the Papiſts, in whole or in part, to reſolve your faith into the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of men, the expoſition of the Church, or of Synods and Councils, that are the Church repreſentative. The Reader by this account may perceive, that in this reſpect you ſubmitted too much to Synods and Councils, and a great deal further then ever we ſubmitted, as is manifeſt from what we have ſhewed, was in this our declared judgement, in our anſwer to your firſt Paper.</p>
                     <p>But we ſhall now further proceed, to give the Reader our Reaſon, why if Synods and Councils (and you ſay of theſe, you <hi>ſhall ſubmit to any that ſhall come hereafter)</hi> ſhould determine againſt you, we feared, in regard of their juridical authority, you would ſubmit too little. There is betwixt you and us a controverſie touching the ſuperiority of Biſhop above Presbyters; we deny it, you
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:119100:109"/>
herein are for the affirmative. You aſſert in the very next Section, that <hi>Ae<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>rius</hi> was condemned for hereſie, for aſſerting this parity of Church-Officers; and it is Biſhops and Presbyters only that are there ſpoken of. There is alſo another controverſie betwixt you and us, touching ruling Elders, whether they be by divine right or no; you herein deny, and we affirme. In theſe matters then, we ſhall take it for granted, till you deny it, that you yeild there is a doubt and difficulty, and touching which you will not have the Scripture to be ſo plain, but that Fathers and Councils muſt be conſulted in theſe caſes; and which was the reaſon, why in the caſe of the ruling Elder, you ſent us to them for to conſult what expoſition they gave of the Texts that we alleadged for the divine right of thoſe Officers. Now the Queſtion is, whether you will ſubmit to the determination of Synods and Councils in regard of their juridical authority? As touching the firſt of theſe matters in difference, we ſhall, in our Animadverſions on your next Section, ſhew, that there are Fathers that deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine againſt you. As touching the other concerning ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Elders, we have in our Anſwer to your ſecond Paper, ſhewed, there are ſeveral Fathers that do give in clear evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence touching the being of this Officer in their times; But as touching this Officer, vvhether he be an Officer of the Church by divine right, vve have not read of any general Council, before vvhom this caſe in controverſie vvas brought, much leſs that they determined againſt vvhat in this point vve hold: (but vve ſuppoſe) that from vvhat you, or vve may alledge out of Fathers or Councils of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cienter times, theſe points vvill not be found to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, but there vvill be a difference betvvixt us ſtill. What then is it, that you vvill ſubmit to? To a general Council that ſhall come hereafter? If ſo, and that you vvill give that due reſpect to Synods and Councils, that may be hereafter, in regard of their juridical Authority; Then untill a general Council may be had, that may be regularly and duely called, and rightly conſtituted; ſeeing the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in difference betvvixt you and us have been tryed and
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:119100:109"/>

Upon this conſideration we cannot but think; that if a general Council ſhould hereafter come, and determine theſe caſes againſt you, you that now ſubmit not, would not ſubmit then: And ſo the upſhot of the matter would be this; that if in theſe or ſuch like caſes in controverſie, you were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe reſolved in your judgements, you would not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the determination of a general Council, in regard of their juridical authority; only if they determined ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your reſolutions, then you would ſubmit; wherein notwithſtanding your great profeſſions of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, you do not ſubmit much.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, But now you find your ſelves agrieved, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe when you ſaid, <hi>you did publiſh this your ſenſe and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion</hi> of our Paper, <hi>as far as it was plain to you,</hi> we leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the words, <hi>as far as it was plain to you,</hi> dealt not fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with you: for you ſay thoſe words carry another ſenſe with them, then indeed we did underſtand them in; that is, as here you explain your ſelves; <hi>ſo far as the matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in our Paper was plain to you, you cloſed and joyned with us, being</hi> (as you ſay) <hi>you explain your ſelves afterward; ſo fully warranted thereunto by the word of God, and conſtant pract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice of the Catholick Church, that therein ſo far as it is thus made plain to you, you ſhall not ſubmit your apprehenſions to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:119100:110"/>
of a general Council;</hi> but now your complaint of us is, that by leaving thoſe words out, which you thus explain, we repreſent you, as if where matters were not ſo plain, but doubtfull, you refuſed to ſubmit. The truth is, we took theſe words referring to our Paper, <hi>ſo far as it is plain to us,</hi> in oppoſition to obſcurity and darkneſs, you after complaining, that other parts of our Paper were full of darkneſs; and then though we left thoſe words out, yet we could not conceive, we wronged you therein, being you could not profeſs your cloſure and joyning with us in any thing in our Paper, any further then you underſtood our plain meaning. But ſeeing you here otherwiſe explain your ſelves, and ſay, you did it before; we will be more liberal to you, then you are to us afterwards, and ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low you the liberty to explain your ſelves; though we do not think, that the ſound and orthodox Reader will judge that your opinion thus explained, and which you have here declared, touching your ſubmiſſion to Synods and Councils, is any ſounder, then as we underſtood you to have meant thoſe words; and which we doubt not, but he will diſcern from what hath been ſaid concerning it, in the Animadverſion going before.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. But by this explication of your ſelves, you have cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated to us a further ſcruple; for it a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>peats to us from thence, (ſeeing you joyn the word of God, and conſtant practice of the Catholique Church together, (as that which muſt make thoſe matters of faith and articles of Religion ſo plain to you, that you thereupon will refuſe to ſubmit ſuch matters, ſo made plain, and your apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions concerning them, to a generall Council) that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the plaineſt matters of faith, and articles of Religion from Gods word be alſo made plain, to have been the conſtant practice (rather judgment, as we think you ſhould have expreſſed it) of the Catholique Church, they are not ſo plain to you, as not to ſubmit your apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions concerning them to a generall Council; and ſo the word of God alone, even in the matters of faith and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Religion, that are therein moſt plainly contained;

ſhall not be a ſufficient foundation, to bottom your faith upon, except it be alſo evident, what was the conſtant and univerſall practice (rather judgment) of the Church in thoſe points; and ſo your faith, even in the plaineſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Religion, muſt be reſolved into the conſtant pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, or rather declared judgment of the univerſal Church, and which makes it a meer humane not a divine faith. But touching this, as the rule in any caſes of matters of Religion, we ſhall have further occaſion to ſpeak in our animadverſions on the ſixth Section of this paper.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. As touching our ſelves, we have declared, that we did not ſubmit to Synods and Councils, ſo as to build our faith on their dictates, or reſolve it into their determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and in this we would be underſtood touching all matters of faith whatſoever; not only thoſe that are moſt plainly contained in Gods word, but alſo ſuch as about which there may be ſome doubt and difficulty, although we reverence Synods as an Ordinance of God; and in way of means, judg it more likely in doubtfull caſes, that what is Gods mind ſhould be boulted forth to our ſatisfaction, by the learned debates of learned, judicious and godly Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines in ſuch Aſſemblies, then by the diſcuſſion of one Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, or ſome few Miniſters. But as touching the juridicall power of Synods, we profeſs our ſelves to be ready, to ſubmit to their judgment, and did ſo ſubmit our Paper wholly to the judgment of our Provinciall, which was a Synod actually in being, and to whom we knowing our ſelves to be accountable, and judging we ought ſo to be, thought it not meet to publiſh the Paper, that was read in our ſeverall Congregations, except it had firſt been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of by them. Now how farre we do, in this decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of our judgements, touching our ſubmiſſion to Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods and Councils, concur with what here you declare to be yours, we leave it to your ſelves, and the Reader to judg of; but we are ſure there is herein a great diſtance betwixt your declared judgment and ours; though you ſhall not finde afterwards, that we do <hi>hardly grant that to a generall Council,</hi> rightly conſtituted and regularly called,

                     <p>FIrſt, We muſt deſire the Reader to take the pains to peruſe the third Section of our Anſwer, to which you do here reply. You do in the next Section tell us, that <hi>the moſt conſiderable part of our Anſwer</hi> (as to the bulke) <hi>doth inſiſt on the proof of the eſtabliſhment of our Government by Authority;</hi> this you alſo ſaid in the cloſe of your ſecond Paper: But if the Reader but compare what is contained in this Section, with what is in the next, where we prove this eſtabliſhment of our Government by authority, he will finde our anſwer here, in this one Section, is conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably larger, then all that great bulk you complain of in the next; and it will be found to be as much, as all that we have touching this matter throughout our whole anſwer. And therefore we cannot but wonder, that you ſhould ſo much forget your ſelves, and ſo little conſider what you ſay, as again and again to aſſert, with no ſmall confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, what is ſo farre from truth. But in this Section the Reader may further deſcern, that you paſs over ſome things in ſilence, to which you ſhould at the leaſt have made ſome reply; teſtifying, either your aſſent to them, and ſo your receiving ſatisfaction, or have given us the grounds of your diſſent: but we ſhall deſire that what was anſwered by us, and is by you replyed unto, might be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared together by the candid Reader, that he may ſee with his own eyes, wherein you fall ſhort.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, You profeſs that in ſome things; you <hi>finde we much diſsent not, only in the third and laſt, concerning the hereſie and ſchiſme of thoſe, who erre ſo groſly in Doctrinals or points of Diſcipline,</hi> you mention the reaſon, we gave you,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:119100:112"/>
why we <hi>did not ſo expreſly mention them, their ſin and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as the groſly ignorant and ſcandalous,</hi> ſcil. <hi>the inconſider a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of the number of the former, to the number of theſe;</hi> But</p>
                     <p>Firſt, This was not the only reaſon we gave, but there was alſo another mentioned, <hi>ſcil.</hi> becauſe we were to give in to the Provincial Aſſembly, what our apprehenſions were, touching the caſe propounded to us by them, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome further meanes to be uſed, for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the ignorant, and reformation of the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, But yet this you pitch upon, becauſe you had a mind to charge us, and all others, that have in our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations ſevered themſelves from the Biſhops, with ſchiſme, that ſo you might hereby alſo invalidate that reaſon rendered of our not mentioning expreſly the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical and ſchiſmatical. But we hope we have, in our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to your ſecond Paper, ſaid that, which will be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to wipe off that aſperſion; and you muſt pardon us, if wherein Dr. <hi>Uſher,</hi> in this point differing from us in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, expreſſed himſelf too farre, we therein (though we otherwiſe reverence him both for his piety and learning) look upon him as a man. We cannot as yet be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that the Biſhops were the only true conſtituted Church of <hi>England;</hi> from whom becauſe we have ſevered our ſelves, you do here (though without any reaſon) charge us to be ſchiſmatical, and to have rent our ſelves from a true conſtituted Church.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, But ſeeing in <hi>this third and laſt,</hi> touching thoſe that are chargeable with hereſie and ſchiſme, you profeſs to diffent from us, you might have teſtified, either your aſſent to, or diſſent from that previous courſe, that in our anſwer we mentioned, was to be taken with theſe before they were to be excommunicated; eſpecially conſidering, we had told you, that though you allowed of admonition of the ſcandalous, before there was proceſs to the cenſure of them, yet you ſaid nothing of this courſe to be taken with the other; and wherein therefore we purpoſely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:119100:113"/>
our ſelves, that if you judged the previous courſe of admonition neceſſary to be held with the ſcandalous, you might not cenſure us, as indulgent toward any of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that might be in any of our Congregations (though we ſaid the number of them was not conſiderable to the number of the ſcandalous) becauſe we took it to be our duty, according to the practice of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> in the Synod at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the <hi>Fathers of the Nicene Council,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers we inſtanced in, to endeavour their conviction, in the due uſe of all good meanes, before there was a proceſs to excommunication. We remembred alſo, how quick the Prelates were, in thundering out their excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, againſt ſuch as (though godly and religious) were in thoſe times accounted by them to be ſchiſmatical; and we thought it requiſite, to bear witneſs againſt thoſe manner of proceedings. But of this you take no notice, and we do not much wonder: for we ſee you count all thoſe, that ſevered themſelves from the Biſhops, ſchiſmatical; and may be, if they had power again in their hands, you did not much matter (though you are willing the ſcandalous ſhould be admoniſhed before) if all theſe, for their great ſchiſme, in your eſteem were forthwith excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, As touching publick Catechizing we ſaid, we heartily wiſhed it had been more generally practiſed in our own Church at home, as it is practiſed by the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches abroad: But by our own Church, we meant the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as it is a national Church; and in which, though Catechizing was enjoyned in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times, yet it was neither ſo generally and conſtantly practiſed, as it ſhould have been; elſe we ſhould not have had ſo much cauſe to have complained of the groſs igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of ſo many aged perſons in our Congregations (who were nor trained up under the Presbyterian, but Prelatical Government) as now we have. And here we obſerve, that when you profeſs you are glad, to hear us ſo heartily wiſh, that Catechizing had been more generally practiſed, it is but that you may take occaſion to affix the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:119100:113"/>
greater blot upon us; for you would have it to be our Churches in whom this neglect is chiefly or only to be found; and it is we, (that are again by you charged with ſeparation) that have by <hi>our pretended reformation,</hi> (as you are pleaſed to ſpeak) deſtroyed this practice. We wiſh as heartily in this caſe, as we did in the other, that you may be ſenſible how prone you are to revile and ſlander, and pray to God that it may not be laid to your charge.</p>
                     <p>But you might have remembred, that as we profeſſed our ſelves to be for publick Catechizing (which bleſſed be God is practiſed in our Churches, though you would make the world to believe that we had deſtroyed it) ſo we profeſſed to be for private too, that ſo ſuch as were not like, in regard of age, or timorouſneſs, to be brought to inſtruction by the publick, might yet by the private gain ſome knowledge. In the Paper alſo, that was publiſhed in the Congregations, there was ſome order ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, for the better and more convenient practice of it. And doubtleſs, by how much we were willing to be at the more pains for the information of the ignorant, the greater fault will lie at your doores, and be charged upon you, (if you repent not of it) that by your oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, you have not only laboured to obſtruct the good courſes by us propounded, for the help of poor ignorant ſouls; but accuſed us alſo, that by our pretended refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation we have deſtroyed Catechizing.</p>
                     <p>Here alſo we take notice, that however in your firſt Paper you had a proviſo touching Catechizing, that it be publick, and that we thereupon gave you ſome reaſon (though briefly) for private Catechizing, yet this you wholly paſs over in ſilence, and ſay nothing to it; thus you pretend to make a reply to our anſwer, and yet but ſpeak to what of it you pleaſe. But if you had manifeſted any diſſatiſfaction, touching private Catechizing, we ſhould here have proceeded, to have given further rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for it; although this work is ſo fully done to our hands by Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in his <hi>Gildas Salvianus,</hi> that it would
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:119100:114"/>
have been needleſs unto thoſe that have read that Book, and whereunto, for his further ſatisfaction, we referre the Reader, if he deſire it.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, If we underſtood you aright in this, that <hi>you held it not fitting, that perſons groſly ignorant ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Sacrament of the Lords Supper,</hi> the concluſion that we inferred hence, ſtands good againſt any thing brought by you to invalidate it.</p>
                     <p>But here we obſerve, you ſtretch it beyond its ſcope, and that in two particulars.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In that you would have it referre to examination before the Elderſhip, which was not that, which we ſpake of: we only ſaid, <hi>there ought to be examination and triall of all perſons before they be admitted to the Lords Supper,</hi> not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining here, touching the perſons by whom this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination was to be made; but only inferring, that then there ought to be this examination; <hi>that ſo the groſly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant might not be admitted, as they might be, if all promiſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſly were to be admitted without any triall at all;</hi> and which was the reaſon, that we alleadged in our anſwer, for the inference we made, and which ſtill ſtands good, you ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging nothing at all to take away the ſtrength of it. It is true, that <hi>the examination and judgement of all ſuch as ſhall for their ignorance, not be admitted to the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, is to be in the power of the Elderſhip of every Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,</hi> and not in the power of one Miniſter only, by the rules of our Government. <note n="a" place="margin">
                           <hi>See forme of Church-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> pag. 30.</note> But this was not the thing we there ſpake of; we only concluded, that there ought to be an examination, and hoped that we had gained from your own conceſſion, this one further ſtep, toward an agreement betwixt you and us, that all ſuch perſons, as ſhould be admitted to the Sacrament of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, muſt be examined by ſome or other, not determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by whom; there being no way to diſcover the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, but by triall. And as touching our practice, it is well known, that when the Elderſhip is ſati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>fied, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the knowledge of ſuch as offer themſelves to that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, upon the examination of a Miniſter and one
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:119100:114"/>
Elder, or upon the examination of two Miniſters (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever none is to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> debarred for their ignorance, but by the juridical act of the Elderſhip, and which is for the better ſecuring of the Church-priveledges to the members, then to have left the power to the Miniſter alone) ſuch are not required, to be examined before the Elderſhip, but are upon the teſtimony of the examiners, (there being nothing to be objected juſtly againſt them) admitted by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Elderſhip.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. There is alſo another thing, wherein you would make our inference to be that, which indeed it was not; for neither did we ſpeak, concerning any examination <hi>de novo,</hi> of ſuch perſons, as had been formerly admitted; our words recited even now, and to be ſeen in our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, do plainly ſpeak, concerning an examination be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore admiſſion to the Lords Supper, not concerning an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination <hi>de novo.</hi> Indeed we ſhall neither be aſhamed of, nor deny what is our practice, which is to take a triall of all the communicants <hi>de novo,</hi> before admiſſion of them to the Lords Supper. We well remember how under the Epiſcopall government, there was a generall admiſſion, and that ſundry groſly ignorant did croud in amongſt the reſt, unto this Ordinance; and therefore that theſe might be diſcovered, and kept off from this Sacrament, till fitter for it; we judged it requiſite, that, according to that power that is glven to the Elderſhip in the form of Church-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, for this purpoſe, there ſhould be a triall taken of all the communicants, that ſo there might be ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction made, and not be a promiſcuous admitting of all as heretofore. And we are ſure, that ſuch amongſt us, who, having <hi>been anciently catechiſed, and a long while commoners at the Lords Table,</hi> (to uſe your own expreſſions) <hi>have wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed the beſt confeſſion for their parts and piety,</hi> have been the moſt forward, to draw on others to be willing to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>examined, by their own good example therein; and that the greateſt oppoſers of this courſe, however they may be ſome of them perſons of parts, yet have been ſuch, as have been either ſcandalous in their lives, or not ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:119100:115"/>
for piety as were to be deſired. We have thus given an account, of what is our practice in this matter; but this examination of communicants <hi>de novo,</hi> was not the thing we here ſpake of, as why the examination of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their admiſſion of them at the firſt, was here mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, we have delared before. But we ſee you are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, to lay hold on any thing, wherein you apprehend you have any advantage againſt us, though it be never ſo ſmall.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, You charge us again with another <hi>non ſequitur;</hi> when we inferre, that if the Churches lawfull Paſtors have power to excommunicate the ſcandalous, <hi>we ſee not in reaſon, how you can find fault with our proceedings, if there ſhould be occaſion for our cenſuring any ſuch perſons;</hi> but this inference yet ſtands good againſt any thing by you alleadg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the contrary, and in it ſelf is clear and manifeſt; being there is no excommunication that paſſeth with us againſt any, but by the juridical act of the lawfull Paſtors of our ſeveral Churches or Congregations; and whoſe power by you ſhould not be queſtioned, or the validity of their cenſures, becauſe of the concurrence of the ruling Elders; as by way of preventing an Objection, we hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to you in our anſwer, conſidering what power was exerciſed in the time of Epiſcopacy, by the High Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, Chancellors and Commiſſaries (as much Lay-men then in your judgement, as ruling Elders can be now) to whom yet there was a ſubmiſſion by you; This reaſon you ſay is weak, but you do not prove it to be ſo; Nay here you fall ſhort in two main points, For</p>
                     <p n="1">1. You miſrepreſent the matter of fact, and that in two particulars: 1. When you would intimate, that the High-Commiſſioners, Chancellors and Commiſſaries, did all of them officiate by deputation from, and under a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Paſtor; when as it is manifeſt, the High-Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners had no deputation from the Biſhop, but received their Commiſſion from the King, (if not the Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors alſo,) and did act in thoſe Eccleſiaſticall cenſures, that were by them paſſed, in joynt and equall power with the
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:119100:115"/>
Biſhop by virtue of their Commiſſion. 2. The Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that did appoint the ruling-Elders in the form of Church government, did not oblige any, that were to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to them, to acknowledg the <hi>jus divinum</hi> of their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, neither do we impoſe this opinion of them upon any. And therefore, notwithſtanding our own judgment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them in this reſpect, the <hi>compariſon</hi> betwixt them and the other, as to what is neceſſary for your ſatisfaction, doth ſtill hould good, and is neither <hi>weak nor frivolous,</hi> as you ſay.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But if the matter of fact ſhould be granted to have been according to your repreſentation, <hi>ſc.</hi> that High-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, Chancellours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> did all of them officiate by deputation from, or under a lawfull Paſtor, how doth this help the matter, to make your ſubmiſſion to theſe lawfull, and yet your ſubmiſſion to the ruling Elders unlawfull? For 1. we are as yet to learn (and we think you will never be able to make it good) that a truſt committed to one by man <note n="*" place="margin">See S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                           <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Bacon.</hi>
                        </note>, much leſs repoſed by God in an officer in the Church, and particularly in the Paſtor may be delega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. If this be ſo, he might ſufficiently diſcharge his duty by another, preach by another, adminiſter the Sacrament by another, as well as diſpenſe the cenſures of the Church by another, who yet himſelf is to give an account of their ſouls unto God; which he will never be able to make, in the omiſſion of thoſe duties in his own perſon, though he appoint another unto them. But being the higheſt offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer in the Church, doth not himſelf act out of plenitude of power, (for that were to make him a Pope and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt; that belonging only to Jeſus Chriſt the King and <note place="margin">Matth. 28. ver. 18.</note> Lord of the Church, to whom all power is given in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth) and hath no more but a miniſtry com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him, which he hath received of Chriſt, as his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, who hath required him to fulfill it; he may not <note place="margin">Col. 4. 17.</note> depute any other as under him, or as his ſervant, to do that which his Lord and maſter hath intruſted him with, and appointed him to do himſelf. 2. But further we do here enquire of you, whether by virtue of that deputation,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:119100:116"/>
which the perſons ſpoken of received from a lawfull Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor, according to your allegation, you will have them to be Eccleſiaſticall officers, or but meer lay-men ſtill? If, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that deputation, they be but meer lay-men, how will you awarrant them to meddle with Eceleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call cenſures? becauſe deputed thereunto by the Biſhop? when God hath excluded all thoſe that are but meer lay-men from medling authoritatively with Eccleſiaſticall matters? If the High-Prieſt in the time of the Law, had given to <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah</hi> a Commiſſion, to have gone into the Temple of the Lord, to burn incenſe upon the Altar of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, and he had ſo officiated by deputation from and under him, would that have been ſufficient to have born him out in ſo doing, whenas that work pertained not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, but unto the Prieſts the ſonnes of <hi>Aaron,</hi> that were <note place="margin">2 Chr. 26. 18.</note> conſecrated to burn incenſe? If by vertue of that deputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they had from the Biſhops, they were Eccleſiaſticall officers, inveſted with authority, to exerciſe Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call juriſdiction and diſpenſe Church-cenſures, and ſo not meer lay-men; we may ſay much more for the outward call unto that office, that our ruling Elders do execute, they having been elected by the people (that anciently had a vote in the choice, even of the very Biſhops, as is clear from the Records of Antiquity) and examined by the Paſtors of the Churches, and by them approved as fit, and ſet apart ſolemnly to rule in the houſe of God by exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Prayer, as hath been ſaid before.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. But you now go on, and declare whom you mean by lawfull Paſtors, <hi>ſc. ſuch perſons as have received their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination from men lawfully and truely qualified with a juſt power of conferring Orders.</hi> Now theſe, according to what you have declared in your former Paper, are the Biſhops, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whom, you there inſinuate, <hi>the Church of God cannot be continued amongſt us, in a ſucceſſion of a lawfully ordained Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry,</hi> and ſo at once caſhier out of the numbet of law-full Paſtors, all ſuch Miniſters either of our own, or other reformed Churches, that are ordained by Presbyters one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and to whom you allow not the power of Ordination,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:119100:116"/>
as you here alſo do plainly declare your ſelves. But we have in our anſwer to that clauſe quoted out of your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Paper, ſufficiently (as we hope the Reader will judg) declared the abſurdity of this your opinion: And you your ſelves (as all men may ſee) may hereby perceive how vain a thing it is, for you and us to labour in any way of accommodation, whilſt you retain theſe principles, they being deſtructive to union, and your communion in ſeverall of our Churches, either in Baptiſme or the Lords Supper. For how can you have communion in thoſe Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances diſpenſed by ſuch Miniſters amongſt us, as being ordained by Presbyters onely, you on this ground will conclude to be no lawfully ordained Miniſters? And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if you be cordiall for union, we wiſh you to reviſe what you have as touching this matter aſſerted, and weigh what in our former Paper we have oppoſed unto it. But as touching the power of ordaining Presbyters by Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters onely, you will have it to be our opinion onely, and that in this we are ſingular; for you ſay, <hi>we (and you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it is none but we) preſume one Presbyter may confer or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders upon another.</hi> And here indeed 1. If we held that one Presbyter might ordain another Presbyter, you had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to accuſe us of ſingularity: but we are profeſſedly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all ſolitary power in ordination, as well as in ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, by whomſoever this power is, or hath been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed. 2. But if your meaning be, that it is we onely that hold, Presbyters alone, without any Biſhops, may ordain Presbyters: 1. You might have known, that this was and is the judgment of the reformed Churches abroad, as well as ours. 2. And further you may remember, we alleadged out of Dr. <hi>Bernard,</hi> the teſtimony of ſeverall Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall men, as well as of Dr. <hi>Uſher,</hi> aſſerting and proving, that in places where Biſhops cannot be had, the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Presbyters ſtandeth valid; which ſpeciall reſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction we mentioned in our Anſwer (as the Reader will finde) and which, though added, would not have hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred (if you had been of the ſame opinion with them) but you might have acknowledged, that ſuch as are with

us ordained by Presbyters onely, are notwithſtanding law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Paſtors; Biſhops being now taken away by the power of the civil Magiſtrate, and excluded from having any liberty to ordain, by thoſe acts where Prelacy is exempted from that indulgence, that is granted to ſome others. If alſo that Catalogue of Divines, Schoolmen and Fathers, that we cited out of Dr. <hi>Bernard,</hi> (who are cited by him alſo out of others) be conſulted, they will be found to affirm (as we ſaid in our Anſwer, though you take no notice of it) <hi>that Epiſcopacy non eſt ordo praeciſè diſtinctus a Sacerdotio ſimplici;</hi> Biſhop <hi>Davenant</hi> (as he is alleadged <note place="margin">

We ſhall not here deny, but Dr. <hi>Uſher</hi> ſaith, <hi>that the ordination made by ſuch Presbyters, as have ſevered themſelves from thoſe Biſhops, unto whom they had ſworn canicall obedience, could not poſſibly by him be excuſed from being ſchiſmaticall.</hi> But yet he doth not ſay that the ordination by them is null and void, although in his judgment there was thereby a ſchiſme made. There may be ſchiſmes in the Church; yea ſome particular Churches may be ſchiſmaticall, and yet for the ſubſtance of them continue true Churches of Jeſus Chriſt; as if it were to our purpoſe, might be cleared both from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and alſo Fathers. But as touching the aſperſion of ſchiſme, that is caſt on ſuch Presbyters that have ſevered themſelves from the Biſhops, we hope it is ſufficiently wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped off, by what we have already ſpoken in our anſwer to your ſecond Paper.</p>

However it ſeems that charge was not high enough, <note place="margin">The imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of perjury taken off.</note> and therefore in this you proceed further, charging us with <hi>perjury</hi> and <hi>obſtinacy;</hi> for you having mentioned that ſpeciall <hi>reſtriction of Dr.</hi> Uſhers, <hi>of not invalidating the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation by Presbyters, where Biſhops cannot be had,</hi> add and ſay, <hi>but this we muſt deſire you to conſider, is ex neceſſitate non

ex perjurio &amp; pertinacia;</hi> and however you would ſmooth up the matter, by bidding us. examine our ſelves in this particular, and ſaying <hi>you ſhall not judge any man;</hi> yet it is plain enough to any diſcerning Reader, who they are that are charged by ſuch expreſſions. But as touching the thing it ſelf, we ſhall now examine the juſtneſs of the charge. And firſt we ſhall begin with that of <hi>perjury,</hi> unto which we ſhall need to ſay the leſs, conſidering that the grounds layd in our Anſwer to your ſecond Paper, (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that ſuch Presbyters, as ſince the Parliaments abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing Prelacy, have ſevered themſelves from the Biſhops, or caſt off Epiſcopacy, are not juſtly to be charged with ſchiſme) do here alſo take place, to acquit ſuch Miniſters, that did ſwear Canonicall obedience to the Biſhops, from the guilt of perjury. We ſhall here onely minde you and the Reader of two things; 1. That ſeeing the ſuperiority which the Biſhops chalenged and exerciſed above Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in this Nation, did belong unto them onely by the Law of the Land, (we having proved in our Anſwer to your ſecond Paper, that a Biſhop and Presbyter in Scripture ſenſe are both one) and was taken away from them by the Legiſlative power of this Nation, (as they might lawfully take it away) that power which they exerciſed not being due to them by Divine right, nay being an uſurpation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Paſtors office, as hath been alſo ſhewd) and ſo their whole Office as Dioceſans, together with their juriſdiction, as ſundry alſo of their Perſons are all extinct (and as is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt in particular, touching him that was the Biſhop of this Dioces) we wonder much (and we think every Reader will here wonder with us) that your great heat for Prelacy, ſhould thus farre have tranſported you, as to charge us with perjury, for which there is not the leaſt colour. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult Dr. <hi>Sanderſon de juramenti promiſſorii obligatione;</hi> conſult all other <hi>Caſuiſts,</hi> and you ſhall finde, that the beſt and ſoundeſt of them, do determine with one conſent, that when the matter of an Oath ceaſeth, the obligation by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of that Oath ceaſeth alſo; and therefore Prelacy being taken away by lawfull authority, there can be no perjury
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:119100:118"/>
in ſuch Presbyters, as now diſown it, and joyn with other of their Brethren in the ordination of Presbyters, without the concurrence of any Dioceſan Biſhop, and which is the caſe here ſpoken to. 2 But every intelligent Reader will readily diſcern, how the Parliament is alſo wounded through our ſides; for if we be guilty of perjury for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owning Prelacy, it is eaſie for to gather, what apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions you muſt needs hereupon have of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that by their authority took it away. But we think we have ſaid that which is ſufficient to rowl away the reproach, that is caſt either on them or our ſelves in this reſpect, and therefore ſhall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to add any more. We therefore now come to the ſecond thing, you here charge us with, which is <hi>pertinacy;</hi> but why ſhould we be charged with this? For no other reaſon, that we can imagine, but becauſe we cannot force our conſciences, to admit of Epiſcopacy again; which the Parliament, upon many weighry and ſound conſiderations hath removed, and of the neceſſity whereof you never went about to convince us, either from Scripture or ſound reaſon. But we do not queſtion, but all ſober Readers, will here ſee cauſe to cenſure you for great uncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, laying ſuch heavy things to our charge, for which you have not the leaſt ſhew of proof; as we we do alſo believe, that what you count <hi>pertinacy,</hi> they will judg to be <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy</hi> in us, in ſticking cloſe to our ſound and good prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, that we muſt not forgoe on ſo eaſie termes, as you would have us. And however you would here make Dr. <hi>Uſher</hi> to patronize you, becauſe he confeſſeth the ordination by Presbyters to be valid, where Biſhops can not be had, &amp; ſo in caſe of neceſſity; yet he hath not a word, touching the imputation, either of perjury or obſtinacy to ſuch Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as have ſevered themſelves from the Biſhops, as he was of a farre other ſpirit, then to have been ſo cenſorious.</p>

next reaſon why you charge our Provincial Aſſembly with novelty is, in regard of the <hi>place</hi> (at <hi>Preſton)</hi> but this exception was prevented in our anſwer (unto which here you make no reply) when we ſaid, <hi>if Provincial Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies be warrantable, and have been of ancient uſe in the Church, that having been long in diſuſe, they of late began to be held at Preſton, that could not juſtly incurre your cenſure;</hi> and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the moſt famous Synods and Councils that have been, or that may be hereafter, muſt be all accuſed in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of novelty, if this be a ſufficient ground of accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, even the firſt four general Councils, of <hi>Nice, Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople, Epheſus and Chalcedon,</hi> thoſe being all as new in regard of their places, where they were aſſembled at the time of their firſt meeting (there having been never ſuch Aſſemblies convened in thoſe places before) as our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Aſſembly was or is, that met, and ſtill ordinarily doth at <hi>Preſton.</hi> But perhaps there is more ſtrength in the laſt reaſon, why you charge it to be a new termed Provincial Aſſembly, when you ſay, <hi>it is new in reſpect of the perſons conſtituting this Aſſembly, lay-men preſiding, and ruleing, and having deciſive voyces in as ample a manner, as the higheſt and chiefeſt in holy Orders, nor doth Biſhop Uſher</hi> (as you ſay) <hi>or what we alleadge out of him, make for ſuch an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly.</hi> But here</p>
                     <p n="1">1. We muſt minde you, that we did not cite Dr. <hi>Uſher,</hi> for to prove the antiquity of Provincial Aſſemblies, in regard of theſe members conſtituting them. Let our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer be peruſed, it will be found to alleadge him for to prove the antiquity of the Aſſemblies of the Paſtors of the Churches, for the ordering Church affairs, and having the power of ruleing them; and becauſe we did not know, whether you were not ſo fond on Prelacy, as not to allow of theſe Aſſemblies, we quoted Dr. <hi>Uſher,</hi> for to prove their antiquity; neither did we conceive, that Dr. <hi>Uſher</hi> would have judged theſe Aſſemblies, where the Paſtors of the Churches are members, to have been whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly new, or the Paſtors to have loſt their authority in them, becauſe the ruling Elders are admitted into them
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:119100:120"/>
as members, whatever his own thoughts might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But as touching them we muſt further minde you, of what we have ſaid before, that they are not meer lay-men, but duely and orderly called to an Eccleſiaſtical Office, although they never <hi>praeſide</hi> in theſe Aſſemblies as moderatours. And further that we have proved from antiquity, in our anſwer to your ſecond Paper, the being of ſuch an Officer in the Church, in the time of <hi>Origen, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe, Auguſtine, Optatus,</hi> and which is ſo clear, that the adverſaries of this Officer cannot deny it; only they would have him to have been as an extraordinary Church-guardian, or admitted on prudential grounds, which yet is but <hi>gratis dictum,</hi> as we have ſaid.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. We ſhall now only further add what is well obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Provincial Aſſembly of <hi>London,</hi> that <hi>Sutlivius,</hi> (a Prelatical Divine, and otherwiſe an oppoſer of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of ruling Elders,) <hi>de concil. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. ſaith, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Jews <hi>Seniores Tribuum,</hi> the Elders of the Tribes, did ſit with the Prieſts in judging controverſies of the Law of God; hence he argues againſt <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> that ſo it ought to be in the Chriſtian Church alſo, becauſe the priveledge of Chriſtians is no leſs, then the priveledge of the Jewes. And it is not denyed by other Prelatica! Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, but by them held and proved, that men of abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which are not Miniſters, are to be admitted into ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councils, (as they have been alſo anciently, and which is too manifeſt to be denyed, it appearing to have been ſo from the ancienteſt hiſtorians, and ſubſcriptions of Councils) and to vote in them as members of theſe Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies. And therefore, however the ruling Elders be be admitted into our Provincial Aſſemblies, as members, (whom you account to be but lay-men) and have deciſive votes there, the Aſſembly ſhould not by you have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of novelty in this reſpect: for you ſee ſuch as were no Miniſters, have been anciently admitted into Synods and Councils, to vote there as members, according to the old rule, <hi>Quod tangit omnes, debet tractari ab omnibus.</hi>

<pb n="215" facs="tcp:119100:122"/>
what incivility or unſatiſfactorineſs there was in this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; or whether there was any thing, that did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>cordial wiſhers of peace and unity, godly, ſober and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate ſpirited men,</hi> as we do not only pretend, but hope to approve our ſelves to be, both to God and men. If it be indeed inconſiſtent with, either an hearty deſire of u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and peace, or with godlineſs and ſobriety, to inſiſt upon the authority of that Parliament, that was inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental for our freedome from Prelatical bondage, and that ſetled the Government, wherein we have acted, and that doth fully awarrant us for whatever we have acted therein; and to inſiſt upon this authority, when we were challenged as tranſgreſſors, <hi>in making Laws and Edicts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Laws in force,</hi> then we muſt confeſs, we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended only to be for peace and unity, when in our hearts we were not real for it. But as our own conſciences ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe us not of diſſembling, (profeſſing that which we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver intended) ſo we believe, whatever your cenſures of us be, others will be more equal judges, then to ſay, the anſwer we gave to your firſt Paper, was any evidence thereof; and ſuch as know what ſome of you were in time paſt, will rather conclude that the urging the authority of Parliament for the ſetling of our Government, and the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warranting of our actings, was that indeed which you could not brook.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, But as you judge our anſwer to your ſecond Paper was uncivill, and not ſuitable to that moderation we made profeſſion of; ſo ſtill you will have the anſwer we gave unto your firſt to be full of darkneſs; although, even as you here repreſent it, it is very plain to any ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary underſtanding, to hold forth thus much, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the miſtakes we ſaw you had run into, might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſome of them ariſe, from your unacquaintedneſs with the rule we walk by (although we ſaid, <hi>we were not to be blamed for any miſtake, that might ariſe ab ignorantiâ juris,</hi> i. e. <hi>in you,</hi> as the whole tenour of the diſcourſe ſhewes; and therefore we added, <hi>whether ſimple or affected, that we determined not, but left it to you to judge of,</hi> who were moſt;

fit, to be judges in a matter of that nature, you therein knowing your own hearts beſt) we were willing to be at ſome pains to acquaint you with it.

                           <hi>See Sect.</hi> 9. <hi>toward the end.</hi>

But this is but a ſmall part, in compariſon of the injury you do us; yet we deſire you might ſee it, that you might not hereafter be charged with it, by him that is to be the ſupream Judge betwixt you and us at the great day.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, As touching the pains that we have taken, and of which you do here again complain, as having ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led our anſwer to ſo <hi>great a bulk,</hi> yea ſo as that the moſt conſiderable part thereof (as to the bulk) inſiſts thereon, (as you ſay) <hi>ſcil.</hi> to prove our Presbyterian Government, to be warranted by the civil anthority; and which you ſay, was not by you oppugned, nor ſo much as queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by you; as alſo touching your judging this diſcourſe to be impertinent, we referre the Reader unto what we have already ſaid, in the ſixth, ſeventh, eighth, and ninth Animadverſions on the firſt Section of this Paper; as alſo to what we mind him of in the firſt Animadverſion on the third Section thereof; by peruſal of all which, he will find how much you forgot your ſelves, when you come over and over again with ſuch aſſertions, they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in them no more ſhew of truth, then only to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that it is weariſome to you to hear of Ordinances

of Parliament; eſpecially ſuch as are for the ſetling of the Presbyterian Government, or what makes for our own neceſſary vindication, and to manifeſt that our actings in the management of that Government, have been regular and orderly, according to the forme of Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment appointed by authority; and to ſee that we took off that Objection, that is commonly made againſt the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Government, as being eſtabliſhed by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment but for three yeares only; and unto which purpoſes, all the Orders, or Ordinances of Parliament, or Rules by them given, and by us recited, tended; and all which in the fourth Section of it (to which the complaint here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers) takes not up above four leafes of our anſwer, which yet in your Preface, your ſelves ſay is ſeven ſheets.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, But what you cannot make out with any co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of truth, you hope to do by ſcoffs and jeers; and therefore you ſay, <hi>we wheel about, and are come to the pole we firſt ſtarted at, like an horſe in a mill, that travels all day, and is no further at night then he was in the morning,</hi> in which alſo there is as little truth, as in your other aſſertions; we having already ſhewed, that our firſt eſſay was, to give you ſome account, how the termes (when we called this, <hi>the firſt Claſs within the Province of Lancaſter,</hi> which you had called ours) were no other, then the Parliament had given us by their Order. That which we attempted in the fourth Section of our anſwer (to which you here reply) was to ſhew, that the Ordinances of Parliament, for the Presbyterian Government, were ſtill in force, and that thoſe rules laid down in them, awarranted all our actings, and particularly what we had publiſhed in our ſeveral Congregations in our Paper; and which whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever doth not ſo ſtart at, becauſe they are Ordinances of Parliament, but that he keeps in his right mind, he will ſee to be different things. But you do ſtill go on with your flowts, and will needs have it to be, that <hi>we went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to prove</hi> (which is your own phraſe and not ours) <hi>our Government to be eſtabliſhed by civill authority, the firſt work we took in hand, and that we are no further yet, but going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:119100:124"/>
to prove,</hi> (your own phraſe again) as if the matter muſt needs be, as you ſay it is; or therefore true, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you repreſent it to be ſo, after a ſcoffing manner.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, And when you have thus pleaſed your ſelves with your taunting expreſſions, you now would profeſs to do us a kindneſs, being willing <hi>to conduct us (if poſſible) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the good old way again, by taking off our Government from the eſtabliſhment of authority,</hi> upon the proof whereof (as you ſay) ſo great a part of our anſwer doth inſiſt. But ſeeing the way you herein go (as will appear anon) doth quite overthrow all other Ordinances of Parliament, as well as thoſe that are for the eſtabliſhment of the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian Government; you muſt excuſe us; though upon your moſt earneſt entreaty, we dare not follow you in this your way, being w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>In the firſt place you tell us, that <hi>when we ſpeak of a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment eſtabliſhed by Law, you hope we mean ſuch as hath the ſtrength and force of a Law, to bind the free born people of this Nation, and thereupon you queſtion, whether our Ordinance of the Lords and Commons, though unrepealed to this day, be of that force; and touching this you referre us to the judgement and reſolution of the Sages of the Law, affirming, that nothing can have the force of a Law, to bind the people, without the concurrent conſent of the three eſtates in Parliament: and you inſtance par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in the Lord Cook, and ſeveral paſſages in his Inſtitutes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In anſwer unto all which, we muſt needs in the firſt
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:119100:124"/>
place (as we did in our anſwer to your firſt Paper) apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logize <note place="margin">The claim for the Presbyterian Government to the civil San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction made good.</note> for our ſelves; that being no Lawyers, we ſhall not take upon us to determine any Law caſe; and that our cauſe in this particular, were fitter to be pleaded by the learned in the Law, that have farre better abilities for it, then we have; only till ſome of theſe undertake in this particular to plead for us, we hope we may be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, freely to ſpeak for our ſelves. And here we ſhall not ſay all that we could, much leſs what perſons better able to deal in an argument of this nature, might. But that which we ſhall ſay is, firſt ſomething in the general; then we ſhall proceed to anſwer more particularly.</p>
                     <p>In the generall we ſay two things, 1. That if the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Parliament for Church Government be of no force, becauſe there was not the concurent conſent of three Eſtates to the making of them, then all Ordinances of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament (without exception of any) are null and void, and of no force to binde the people, as well as thoſe that concern Church Government: and ſo it concerns all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees that have been throughout the Land, and thoſe that have acted under them, or do yet act, and all Judges and Juſtices, that have acted or do act, upon any Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Parliament, to conſider what they have to ſay, to what you do here alledge againſt their proceedings, as well as againſt ours. Nay then the Act made <hi>Anno</hi> 1650, for Relief of Religious and peaceable People, that yet is afterwards much inſiſted on by you, is of no force; for to that queſtionleſs there was not the concurrent conſent of three Eſtates in Parliament.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That the Parliament themſelves, who made theſe Ordinances, declared; That, the King having not onely withdrawn himſelf from the Parliament, but leavied war againſt it, <hi>ſalus populi</hi> was <hi>ſuprema Lex;</hi> and thereupon by Ordinance of Parliame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t they proceeded to ſettle the affairs both of Church and State without his conſent; yea and to repeal ſome former acts; and as they did expreſly, when they paſſed the Ordinance for the Directory for Worſhip; repealing the Acts of Parliament, that had been paſſed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly

And if we forget not, it was by them in thoſe times further declared; That however the King had withdrawn his Perſon from the Parliament, yet his Royall Authority could not be withdrawn. But we know, that what the Parliament in thoſe dayes acted, in the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing thoſe and ſuch like Ordinances, was approved by the Sages of the Law, that in thoſe times adhered to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. And this will now lead us to return our more particular anſwer, to what you preſent, for to take away the obliging force of Ordinances of Parliament.</p>
                     <p>And therefore, 1. We ſay, That that long Parliament (as you call it) who did ſo much honour the Lord <hi>Cook,</hi> as to publiſh his Works by their ſpecial appointment, did ſo well underſtand him, that they were well aſſured, there was not any thing in them, that condemned their proceedings as illegal: as on the contrary, we do thereupon conceive, that if he had been alive in thoſe times, he would have juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them. And further we ſay (under correction) that all youalledg out of him, was and is to be underſtood in caſes ordinary, not as it was in the times when the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances for Church Government, and other Ordinances for the ſetling the affairs of the Nation were paſſed, when the King had withdrawn himſelf from the Parliament, and levyed war againſt it. 2. But to add ſome further confirmation to what we here aſſert; be pleaſed to take notice that we meet with a Book printed in this very year, 1658. Entituled, <hi>A collection of Acts and Ordinances of general uſe, made in the Parliament, begun and held at</hi>
                        <pb n="221" facs="tcp:119100:125"/>
Weſtminſter, <hi>the third day of</hi> November 1640. <hi>and ſince unto the adjournment of the Parliament begun and holden the</hi> 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                        <hi>of</hi> Septem. Anno 1656. <hi>and formerly publiſhed in print, which are here printed at large with marginall notes or abreviated; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a continuation of that Work from the end of Mr.</hi> Poltons <hi>Collection, by</hi> Henry Scobell <hi>
                           <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Clerk of the Parliament; examined by the Original Records, and now printed by ſpeciall Order of Parliament.</hi> In this book, as we finde the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for the Directory of Worſhip, recited at large, and likewiſe the Ordinance above mentioned, for the aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Archbiſhops and Biſhops within the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> and Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> ſo likewiſe we meet with the Ordinance of <hi>Aug.</hi> 29. 1648. eſtabliſhing the form of Church Government, to be uſed in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> after advice had with the Aſſembly of Divines; and this recited at large, as will appear to any that will peruſe that book. And being the deſign of that book was, to make a continuation of a Collection of Acts and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of generall uſe, from the end of Mr. <hi>Poltons</hi> Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as appears by the Title of it; the Parliament, that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed this book to be printed by their ſpeciall Order, and Mr. <hi>Scobell the Clerk of the Parliament,</hi> who collected theſe Acts and Ordinances, and examined them by the originall Records, were much miſtaken in the putting forth this book, that is alſo printed in a large black Character, after the manner of the Statutes; if no Ordinances of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment have in them any force to oblige the people of this Nation. 3. We have onely one thing more to add, <hi>ſc.</hi> that in the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Section of the Humble Advice, (and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we minded you in our Anſwer) it is expreſly provided, that <hi>the Acts and Ordinances not contrary thereunto, ſhall conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue and remain in force:</hi> Now that there is nothing in the form of Church Government contrary to any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the humble Advice, we ſhall make out anon: But thus we hope, we have ſaid that which may be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, for anſwer to your firſt exception againſt the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Parliament for Church Government, as not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the concurrent conſent of the three Eſtates, and to
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:119100:126"/>
what you alledge out of the Lord <hi>Cooke.</hi> As touching what you urge out of Judg <hi>Jenkins,</hi> ſaying, an Ordinance of both Houſes is no Law of the Land, by their own confeſſion (meaning the Parliament) 1. <hi>part Coll. of Ordinances, fol.</hi> 728; we cannot give that credit to his repreſentation of the Parliament, (he having been an oppoſer of it) as to conclude thence, there is no force in any Ordinance of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, to oblige the people of this Nation; conſidering that in ſome of their Ordinances, they do, as we have ſaid, expreſly repeal former Acts of Parliament, made by the concurrent conſent of the three Eſtates; and conſidering, that if they have any where any expreſſions to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, they may be underſtood either of Ordinances of Parliament made in caſes ordinary, when the King had not withdrawn himfelf from it, or concerning ſuch as were of no long continuance, but for the preſent emergency; or of ſuch as were but temporary and long ſince expired; and which ſort of Ordinances, Mr. <hi>Scobell</hi> in his Preface to the Book above mentioned, ſaith, he collected not; but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuch whereof there is or may be daily uſe, as he there ſpeaks.</p>
                     <p>We have now donewith your firſt exception againſt the Ordinances by us recited, for the eſtabliſhing Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and come to your ſecond; <hi>for admitting Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Parliament, to have an obligatory force in them; yet thoſe that concern the eſtabliſhment of the Presbyterian Government,</hi> you would have to be repealed. Indeed here you ſaid ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, if you could bring forth any of thoſe ſubſequent Acts, that you ſpeak of, (granting liberty to pious people in the Land) that did repeal the Ordinances for Church Government, either implicitly or expreſly: For we ſhall not deny, that <hi>Leges poſteriores priores contrarias abrogant,</hi> but in this you fall ſhort, as in the former. There is not any ſubſequent Act or Ordinance, that we have ſeen, or that you mention, that grants any liberty to any, which is deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the form of Church Government. The Act made 1650, for relief of Religious and peaceable people, from the rigour of former Acts of Parliament in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:119100:126"/>
(and which you will have to be an expreſs repeal) doth not make void the Ordinance which we act<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>on: It onely repeals the poenall Statutes, that impoſed mulcts and puniſhments on the offenders againſt thoſe Laws, in their bodies or eſtates: It doth not at all refer to the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call cenſures, nor ſo much as mention them, as will be clear to him that will peruſe it. And ſo the Ordinance eſtabliſhing the form of Church Government, ſtands whole and entire, and untoucht at all by this Act. But here we deſire two things might be obſerved; 1. That if this Act ſtood good againſt our proceedings, repealing the Ordinances eſtabliſhing the Presbyterian Government, ſo as that the perſons mentioned in it, were thereby exempt from all Eccleſiaſticall cenſure, then it muſt needs much more ſtand good againſt all other ſorts of perſons, that have no ſuch Ordinance awarranting their proceedings, and would be a barr in their way, that they could not cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure with Church cenſures any of their members. 2. That, being you in your Papers do fully declare your ſelves for <hi>Epiſcopacy;</hi> and that the Acts granting ſome indulgence to ſome perſons, yet do ſtill provide, that the liberty granted by them, ſhould not be extended to <hi>Popery and Prelacy;</hi> neither this nor any other Act for the relief of any pious or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cientious Chriſtians, can with any colour, be alledged by you, to the purpoſe for which you urge them.</p>
                     <p>As touching the eleventh Section of the humble Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, (to which you referre us) we had throughly peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it, and ſeriouſly weighed it, before you minded us of it: but we never did, neither do we as yet ſee any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety betwixt it, and the forme of Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment eſtabliſhed by Ordinance of Parliament. We finde ſtill, as we told you in our anſwer, though you here nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther take notice thereof, nor make any reply thereto) that <hi>it ſeems clearly to own the Directory for worſhip, and the forme of Church Government, as the publique profeſſion of the Nation for worſhip and Government;</hi> as we alſo ſaid in our anſwer, there were the like expreſſions in <hi>the Government of the Commonwealth of England Scotland and Ireland, as it was
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:119100:127"/>
publikely declared at Weſtminſter, Decemb.</hi> 16. 1653. <hi>pag.</hi> 43. <hi>Sect.</hi> 37. And if you had pleaſed, you might have found, that whatever indulgence, is granted to any in this Sect: it is there expreſly provided, that that liberty be not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to <hi>Popery and Prelacy.</hi> And therefore you, and all men may diſcern, that when you ſay (ſpeaking of the humble Advice) that <hi>in the eleventh Section, all Miniſters throughout the Land and their Aſſemblies, profeſſing the true Proteſtant Religion, though of different judgments in worſhip and diſcipline, are all of them equally protected in the liberty of their profeſſion,</hi> that propoſition is a great deal larger, then the humble Advice will allow of; it expreſly concluding, even from that protection allowed to ſome others, the way of <hi>Prelacy,</hi> though it ſhould be ſet up by ſome Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and others of the Proteſtant Religion; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all Miniſters and their Aſſemblies, though profeſſing the Proteſtant Religion, cannot equally lay claim to the protection there ſpoken of. But for anſwer to all that you here urge out of this eleventh Section, of the humble Advice, we ſhall ſay two things. 1. That as your ſelves ſpeak only of protection, allowed by it, to ſome perſons of different judgement in worſhip or diſcipline, ſo who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever will peruſe this Section, ſhall not find, that it ſaith one word, touching the reſtraint of the exerciſe of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcipline towards any; when it ſpeaks of ſome <hi>(that ſhall differ in other things</hi> (ſc. that had been mentioned particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly before) <hi>in doctrine, worſhip or diſcipline, from the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick profeſſion held forth, to whom</hi> it allows protection from injury, as it grants them a freedom from mulcts and civil penalties; and then after of <hi>ſuch Miniſters, or publick Preachers, who ſhall agree with the publick profeſſion in matters of faith, although in their judgement and practice they differ in matters of worſhip and diſcipline,</hi> whom it makes capable, <hi>(being otherwiſe duely qualified and duely approved)</hi> of ſome ſpecial grace and favour, that the former ſort are not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of; it is plain from thoſe expreſſions, that it owns a publique diſcipline, which is not held forth any where, but in the forme of Church Government, eſtabliſhed by
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:119100:127"/>
Ordinance of Parliament for the Church of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Aug.</hi> 29. 1648. that hath been often times mentioned. But you will not find, that the exerciſe of this publick diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline held forth, is any where at all in this Section prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or that it is reſtrained in regard of its exerciſe towards any, or limited only in that reſpect, to the Miniſters and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies of this or the other perſwaſion. And yet that this publick diſcipline held forth, as aforeſaid, might be free from all ſuſpition of any undue rigour or harſhneſs towards any; we ſhall here mention one rule (which we recited, with ſeveral other things, in our anſwer to your firſt Paper) touching the Order preſcribed in the forme of Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, of proceeding to excommunication, which runs in theſe words;</p>
                     <q>But the perſons who hold other errours in judgment, about points wherein learned and godly men poſſibly may or do differ, and which ſubvert not the faith, nor are deſtructive to godlineſs, or that be guilty of ſuch ſins of infirmity, as are commonly found in the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, or being otherwiſe ſound in the faith, and holy in life, (and ſo not falling under cenſure by the former rules) endeavour to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace, and do yet out of conſcience, not come up to the obſervation of all thoſe rules, which are or ſhall be eſtabliſhed by authority, for regulating the outward worſhip of God, and government of his Church, the ſentence of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication for theſe cauſes ſhall not be denounced againſt them.</q>
                     <p>By this one rule it is very clear, that as this diſcipline is not to be accuſed of undue ſeverity, ſo there is no repugnan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy between the humble Advice and it. 2. That which in the ſecond place we have to ſay, is, that admitting your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition were fully as large in the humble Advice, in regard of the perſons to whom you would have liberty to be extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as you have laid it down (which yet we have ſhewed is not ſo) yet how inconſequently do you argue? when you will inferre an exemption of perſons from Church cenſures, authorized to be exerciſed by the forme of Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, from the humble Advice, becauſe it affords them a protection againſt civil injuries. As if this propoſition were
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:119100:128"/>
moſt certainly true; <hi>All thoſe, that according to the humble Advice, are to be protected againſt civil injuries, are thereby ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from Church cenſures;</hi> and yet this muſt be proved, or your conſequence is never proved. But to make that out, we ſhall allow you time, and in the mean ſeaſon muſt deny it.</p>
                     <p>And ſo now all you have, to the concluſion of this Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is but meer varniſh; although we are able to tell you, as we have told you even now, and often before, what pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is granted unto us (who act by an unrepealed Ordinance of Parliament, and yet in force) <hi>that others have not;</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though when you ſay, <hi>are theſe within the bounds of our aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation, ſubject to our Government, unleſs they will renounce their Baptiſm and Chriſtianity?</hi> (and which you would repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent us to aſſert, in that recital you make of our words in the beginning of the next Section) you do therein manifeſtly offer violence to the words of our anſwer: for if the <hi>Reader</hi> peruſe the firſt part of the fifth Section of our anſwer, he may there find, that we declared our ſelves in the firſt place, fully againſt thoſe of the ſeparation, and concluded that diſcourſe with theſe words, <hi>that hereupon our work was not to conſtitute Churches, but to reforme them only: And that therefore none within our bounds, except they ſhall renounce Chriſtianity and their Baptiſme, can be deemed by us to be without in the Apoſtles ſenſe;</hi> this being our anſwer, to what you had preſſed us with, in your firſt Paper, pleading your exemption from under our Governement, from the words of the Apoſtle, and ſaying, <hi>for what have you to do, to judge thoſe that are without?</hi> The concluſion then that we inferd, did anſwer that argument you urged from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles words. For its plain from our declaring our ſelves, we judged none to be without in the Apoſtles ſenſe, but only Heathens, of whom the Apoſtle ſpake; or ſuch, as having for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly profeſſed Chriſtianity, did renounce it, and their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme; and that therefore none could be exempted, by thoſe words of the Apoſtle, from being within the verge of our Presbyterian Governement; which was the inference we thereupon made. By all which it is very clear, in what ſenſe thoſe words were to be taken, that you here mention;
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:119100:128"/>
and that we did not ſay, that <hi>except men did renounce Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity and their Baptiſme, they were ſubject to our Government,</hi> (as you would have it to be) but that they could not be judged by us, to be <hi>without</hi> in the Apoſtles ſenſe, except they ſhould make ſo great an apoſtacy; and wherein we were more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral and charitable toward you, then you were toward your ſelves. It is one thing, that makes a member of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick viſible Church, and another, that makes a member of this or that particular Church; as it is alſo true, that the cenſures of the Church, Government, Offices, and Ordinances are firſt given to the univerſal viſible Church, before they be given to this or that particular Church; although it be true alſo, that he who is a member of the Catholick Church, muſt alſo be a member of ſome particular Church, under the Diſcipline and Government thereof.</p>
                     <p>But we did not argue from what made you members of the Catholick Church, to prove you to be members of ſome one or other of our particular Churches, and ſo to be under the Government of this Claſs; this we prove from individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating circumſtances, becauſe within the bounds of our Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation appointed by authority of Parliament, and other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances. And ſo we do not ſay, that except men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce Chriſtianity and their Baptiſme, they are ſubject to our Government; but we ſay, we look upon all thoſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the bounds of our Aſſociation, who have not renounced Chriſtianity and their Baptiſme (of which ſort we know not any amongſt us) as perſons we have an inſpection o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and appointed by Ordinance of Parliament to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to our Government; which yet we exerciſe towards all, according to thoſe rules, and that moderation, that is preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in the forme of Church Government.</p>
                     <p>And thus we have anſwered, all that you have here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, to take off our Government from its eſtabliſhment by the civil Sanction; for it is not your coming over again with the Act of 1650. already anſwered, and bidding us to read it; nor your bidding us to read the cloſe of the Eleventh Section of the humble Advice, and not proving any thing in the form of Church Government to be contrary to it, that will prove
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:119100:129"/>
either an expreſſe or implicit repeal, though preſſed with never ſo much vehemency of expreſſions; that onely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim your heat, and earneſt deſire to have it ſo; and how gladly you would be believed upon your word, and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in this matter, when you want further arguments to make out what you ſay.</p>

And not only this, but when in your firſt Paper, you had upbraided us, with <hi>the garniſhing of our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, with the specious title of Chriſts Government, Throne and Scepter,</hi> and we had anſwered you out of your own Paper,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:119100:131"/>
and ſhewed, from the expreſſions you had therein uſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Government, that you are for, that that with you muſt be <hi>Chriſts Government, Throne and Scepter;</hi> and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, we were not to be condemned, if we had uſed ſuch expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions concerning our Government, till you had convinced us that it was not ſuch; yet all this is paſſed over, without ſo much as mentioning what we had ſaid, or returning any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to it; as if it were nothing for you to upbraid us with what, if it were a tranſgreſſion, you your ſelves were found guilty of; and when we had ſo anſwered it, to ſay nothing to it; the like whereunto you do alſo here practice, in ſaying nothing to what we had anſwered, when you had told us, that it was the chief deſign of the Paper, we publiſhed in our Congregations, to ſubject all to our Government. For in our Anſwer we firſt apologized for our ſelvs, profeſſing, that <hi>though we were charged by ſome to affect dominion,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>yet the Government of the Church was but Miniſteriall, and that we acknowledged all ſubjection to the civil Magiſtrate;</hi> and then we retorted upon you thus, and ſaid, that you being for the ſetling a Government in the Church, we did not judg you to be ſo irrationall, as to be for a Government, and yet deny ſubjection to it; whence alſo it was clear, that that was not to be condemned in us, which you would juſtifie in your ſelves: yet about this alſo in this your Reply, there is deep ſilence. But thus we have ſhewed, how you are pleaſed to ſeverall things in our Anſwer to ſay nothing, as it will be evident to the Reader, you ſay as good as nothing in ſundry places, where you would ſeem to ſay ſomething; and yet you would be thought to ſay, what might be ſufficient to give us ſatisfaction. For in your ſecond Paper, ſpeaking to one head of our Anſwer. <hi>ſc.</hi> that about ruleing Elders, you ſaid you would <hi>proceed to ſhew us, that lay-Elders</hi> (as you call them) <hi>are not meant in the Texts by us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged; briefly thus, but more largely hereafter, if what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in this Paper be not judged ſatisfactory;</hi> and yet when you ſhould come in this Reply in the next Section, to make this appear more fully, you ſay nothing to the Texts we urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but only, that they are too generall, to prove our ruling Presbytery out of; and tell us of wreſting the Scriptures, with

ſuch like expreſſions, ſuitable to your way of replying all along, and which we doubt not but the wiſe Reader will of himſelf obſerve; onely we thought it requiſite, upon the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion you here give us, to mind him of it, that he might the better obſerve you through your whole Reply.</p>

And whereas you ſay, they take it <hi>for the company of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> i. e. <hi>Biſhops who lay hands on the new made Biſhops or Prieſts,</hi> explaining the word (Presbyters) by Biſhops, and again the word (Biſhops) by Prieſts (that is a quipollent to the word Presbyters) you muſt hence be forced to confeſs, that theſe Fathers acknowledged, the Ordination by Presbyters only, to be valid; they by their explication of themſelves, by you alleadged, making Biſhops and Presbyters (who without controverſie laid on hands) all one. And therefore if you here be of the mind of theſe Fathers, by your ſelves produced, you muſt retract your opinion, formerly declared with much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, againſt the Ordination by Presbyters only. There is no place for you here to evade, except you ſhall ſay, that the Fathers by you alleadged (and explaining the word <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> by Biſhops, or you expounding them ſo) by Biſhops un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand ſuch Biſhops, as were ſuperiour to Presbyters, either in Order and Juriſdiction, or at leaſt in degree; (and whom you will have to concurre at the leaſt, and preſide in the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, or it is null and void) but this is to ſay that the Fathers, expounding the Scripture, do make it a noſe of wax, and in effect to aſſert, that <hi>quidlibet</hi> may be drawn <hi>ex quolibet.</hi> For if by Presbyters that are expreſly mentioned, not Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters themſelves, but another and diſtinct ſort of perſons are to be underſtood, never called in Scripture by that name, may we not by this rule of expoſition make the Scripture ſpeak what we pleaſe, according to our own fancies, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the expreſs words of the Text?</p>
                     <p>To ſay nothing, that this evaſion (if admitted) would not help the matter at all; feeing you do here repreſent the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,

For that we ſaid, divers of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did interpret this word (Presbytery) as we did, and as we ſaid had been declared before. That which in our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer we ſaid, had been declared before, referd to what we
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:119100:133"/>
had before <hi>(ſc.</hi> in the latter part of the third Section of it) alledged out of Dr. <hi>Uſher, in his reduction of Epiſcopacy unto the forme of Synodicall Government;</hi> where he proves from ſeveral of the Fathers, and from the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> that Presbyters had a hand in the adminiſtration of the Diſcipline of Chriſt. We produced him, alledging the Fathers you here make mention of; and you your ſelves, even now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged many more, interpreting the word (Presbytery) uſed 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. in the ſame ſenſe that we concurre with; and which concurrent ſenſe of ours with the Fathers we declared, in that ſhort Parentheſis on which you do thus enlarge, when we ſaid, the Fathers did underſtand the word (Presbytery) as we do. But now what is it that you lay to our charge? or what is it that is our offence, with which you here upbraid us? You tell us, it is becauſe we ſaid, the Fathers under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the word (Presbytery) as we did, and becauſe we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Dr. <hi>Uſher,</hi> ſpeaking in this ſenſe. But as to the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Presbyters (and which was all that in the place above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned in our anſwer, we alleadged him to bring in the Fathers to ſpeak for) is not this clear and manifeſt to him that will either peruſe what he hath, or what you acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, we alleadge out of him, or ſhall but conſider what Fathers you your ſelves do ſay, do expound 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. <hi>touching the company of Presbyters,</hi> i. e. <hi>the Biſhops that lay on hands?</hi> And therefore if you preſs us herein to ſtand to their ſenſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, by us alleadged out of Dr. <hi>Uſher,</hi> we ſhall <hi>not run back,</hi> nor have any cauſe to be <hi>aſhamed,</hi> when we <hi>aſſert,</hi> that their interpretation of the word (Presbytery) is the ſame with ours.

For that Presbytery, which we ſay is eſtabliſhed by Ordinance of Parliament, and is that which we ſtand for, and which when we ſpeak of the Government of the Church by Presbytery, do mean by that word, is not the ſame with that Presbytery, which the Fathers underſtand. And this we ſuppoſe you ſay, becauſe you judge, the Fathers do not comprehend the ruling Elders under the word (Presbytery) mentioned, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. To which we anſwer, that where we alledged the Fathers out of Dr. <hi>Uſher,</hi> we never produced them for any ſuch pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:119100:133"/>
as to prove, that the ruling Elders were comprehended under the word (Presbytery) 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. only we thought to gain upon you by ſteps, and from what Dr. <hi>Uſher</hi> alledged the Fathers for, thence to inferre the antiquity of Aſſemblies, where the Paſtors of the Church are members, have deciſive votes, and a right to rule; and unto which if you aſſented, we judged, then we were ſo farre agreed; and which was the reaſon why, mentioning his propoſal of Aſſemblies, we ſaid, they <hi>were the ſame in ſubſtance with ours,</hi> (and for the reaſon of which expreſſion, we have in this our anſwer to this your Paper, given a full account before, and to prevent repetition, do referre the Reader thither) however the ruling Elders be admitted into them as members; although we deſire the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to take notice, and do mind you thereof, that we have ſhewed, that it is no novel thing, for to admit ſuch to have deciſive votes in Synods and Councils, that were never or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to preach and adminiſter the Sacraments; and that we have alleadged teſtimonies of the Ancients, for to prove the being of ſuch an Officer, as the ruling Elder in their times; and conſequently, that he was a member of the Eccleſiaſtical conſiſtory. But we have thus ſhewed, for what ſenſe of the word (Presbytery) we alleadged the Fathers out of Dr. <hi>Uſher;</hi> as it will be manifeſt to him that will peruſe our anſwer, in that place where we cite them. And now we leave it to the Reader to judge, whether we have for this, merited ſuch lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage from you, as here you give us.

that might be found even amongſt Heathens, having not one forehead?

                     <p>WE are ſure we are now come, to that which is the worſt part in all your Paper, your principles here being very corrupt, even in a Doctrinall matter of high concernment, and that diſtemper which was upon your ſpirit, breaking out here into railing in an high degree, if not to blaſphemie; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides your flandering of us and ſcoffing at us, which is ordinary with you, of which we ſhall ſpeak anon particularly.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. But we ſhall begin with that Repreſentation, which you firſt make, of what we anſwered to that Objection which you made out of our Paper; wherein as you cut it ſhort, ſo you do manifeſtly deprave our words; for though, ſpeaking of that, which was to be the rule of deciding controverſies, touching Ghurch Government, or of any other matters of Religion, we ſaid, <hi>That the Word of God alone,</hi> and then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded (which you here wholly leave out) <hi>and the approved practice of the Church recorded there (whether it was the univerſal and conſtant practice of the Church or no) is to be the onely rule to judge by, in this or any other controverſies in matters of Religon;</hi> yet we never ſaid, <hi>away therefore with the conſtant and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal practice of the hCurch,</hi> this being an addition of your own: and which, when you profeſs to repreſent what we ſaid, was
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:119100:138"/>
no more fair, then your former ſubſtraction; eſpecially when ſuch additions, or ſubſtractions belonged to the true ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Queſtion betwixt you and us; although, if the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall and conſtant practice of the Church, muſt be added to the will and Word of God, or it is not a ſufficient and perfect rule whereby to guide us; we may well then ſay, <hi>away with the conſtant and Univerſal practice of the Church,</hi> in this ſenſe. And yet in our Anſwer you might have taken notice; that we ſaid, <hi>we did much honour and reverence the Primitive Churches,</hi> although we profeſſed, we owed greater reverence to the Scriptures then to them; and whereby we did not judg, they were any whit diſparaged, as they themſelves would never have thought upon ſuch an expreſſion. But in our Anſwer, after we had propounded the rule which you ſeemed to us to make for deciding of the controverſie, touching Church Government and other matters of Religion, <hi>ſc.</hi> the Word or will of God, and the conſtant and Univerſal practice of the Church (as if the Word of God alone, except confirmed or explained by the conſtant and Univerſal practice of the Church when there were any doubt about any matter (as here you ſpeak) were not of it ſelf ſufficient to determine it, and which is that rule which here you own, we firſt (ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it were admitted of) put you upon it to prove, <hi>what was the Univerſal prctice of Primitive Churches, in the matter of Church Government; intimating to you, that we thought it would be hard for you, or any others to demonſtrate out of any Records of Antiquity, what tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

In the next place we came to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the rule it ſelf, and for this alſo we gave you our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, none of which you do either recite in your repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what we had here ſaid, or return any anſwer to after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; and which is ſuch a kind of replying to our Anſwer, as we believe, all ingenuous rationall men would have been
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:119100:138"/>
aſhamed of, who would have conceived, they were obliged either to have returned ſome anſwer to our arguments, or to have never replyed at at all, but been ſilent. But ſeeing you mention them not, we ſhall give the Reader a ſhort ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count what they were, and referre him to the anſwer it ſelf, where he may ſee them more fully. The reaſons we gave, why we could not admit of the rule you laid down, were three, although we did not in our anſwer number them, and which perhaps might be the reaſon, why you might think, if you took no notice of them, ſuch an eſcape might the more eaſily paſs.</p>
                     <p>The firſt reaſon we urged againſt your rule was, becauſe thereby the Scriptures were accuſed as imperfect, or as not having light enough in themſelves, for the reſolving all doubts touching matters of faith and practice, except it were firſt known, what was the univerſal practice of Primitive Churches.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The ſecond was, becauſe admitting the conſtant and univerſal practice of Primitive Churches, to be that which muſt aſſure us, what is the will of God concerning Church Government, our faith is hereupon reſolved into a moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain ground, and ſo made fallible, and turned into opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; there being no monuments of antiquity beſides the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that could infallibly aſſure us, touching the matters of fact therein contained.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Our third reaſon was, becauſe if we could be aſſured what was the univerſal and conſtant practice of the Primitive Churches, yet that could not be a rule to us, what is moſt conſonant to the will of God; conſidering, that in ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as are not abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation, we did not ſee, but the univerſal practice of the Churches, might in ſome things be diſſonant to the will of God revealed in Scriptures. We here ſhewed, there were corruptions and ſo failings in practice in the beſt of men, inſtancing in the hot contention betwixt <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="248" facs="tcp:119100:139"/>
and Government, as the Reader will ſee more fully upon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſall of our anſwer; and where he will finde all theſe reaſons, though you here were pleaſed to take no notice of any of them. But we hereupon inferred, that whereas you ſay, <hi>that you pray for the eſtabliſhment of ſuch Church Government, as is moſt conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the will of God, and univerſal practice of Primitive Churches; we did believe you might cut the matter a great deal ſhorter</hi> (which you eagerly catch at in the repreſentation you make) <hi>and ſay, that you are for the eſtabliſhing of that Government, that is moſt conſonant to the will of God revealed in the Scriptures, and that the word of God alone (and on which only faith muſt be built, and into which at laſt be reſolved, when other records of antiquity, that yet are not ſo ancient as it is, have been ſearched into never ſo much) ſhall determine what that is; and ſo thoſe weariſome and endleſs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes, about what is the univerſall and conſtant practice of Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Churches (and which if it could not be found out, in any good meaſure of probability, for the firſt three hundred yeares after Chriſt, could never yet be ſo far iſſued, as to be a ſure bottome, whereon our faith may ſafely reſt) may be cut off; it being a moſt certain rule, and eſpecially in matters of faith, that the</hi> factum <hi>is not to preſcribe againſt the</hi> jus, <hi>the practice againſt the right, or what ought to be done.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We have been the larger, in making this repreſentation of what we had anſwered, becauſe yours is here ſo ſhort; and alſo becauſe you come not at all afterward, to anſwer any of our reaſons, but fall upon us with foule language, as if that were ſufficient to anſwer an argument; but upon this repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation that we have made, and the Reader his peruſing, what he may find in our anſwer more fully, and what you here reply unto it; comparing all together, he will be better able to judge concerning the whole matter; as we doubt not, but he will conceive, the arguments we urged, againſt the rule you had laid down, for the deciding of controverſies in matters of Religion, ſtanding ſtill in their full ſtrength, it will not be neceſſary for us, to urge any more to that purpoſe, till theſe, that we have already urged, be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Yet becauſe you ſay ſomething, againſt what we inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:119100:139"/>
touching making the word of God alone, the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miner, and ſo be judge concerning all controverſies in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and particularly concerning that betwixt you and us, touching Church Government, we ſhall firſt examine what you oppoſe thereunto, and then ſhall give our reaſons for this aſſertion. We cannot call, what you oppoſe us with, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments; but what you ſay, ſuch as it is, we ſhall ſpeak to. 1. And firſt, For our laying down this rule, you cannot (it ſeems) your ſelves forbear laughter, and think it ſtrange, if there be any, that can forbear laughing hereat with you; and then you rail upon us, calling us <hi>Scripturiſts,</hi> and ſuch <hi>as cry, verbum Domini, verbum Domini, nothing but Scripture, the word of God being there, the only rule of faith and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</hi> If theſe words had been belched out by ſome railing <hi>Rabſhakeh,</hi> a ſtranger to the true God and the true Religion, we ſhould have held our peace, and not anſwered you a word, according to <hi>the Commandment that was given by Hezekiah, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, anſwer him not:</hi> or had they been uttered by ſome Papiſt, or Popiſh Prieſt, we ſhould not much have wondered; but when they come out of the mouths of ſuch, as profeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be Proteſtants, and <hi>diſſenting Chriſtians</hi> (though in the principle here laid down, touching the judge of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies, you are downright Popiſh, and that Mr. <hi>Allen,</hi> an ancient Proteſtant Miniſter, hath put his hand to ſuch ſtuff as this, who ſhould not have reproached his fellow brethren upon this account; it being no wayes allowable, that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters ſhould preſs any thing upon the conſciences of their people, but what they do bring <hi>verbum Domini, the word of the Lord for.</hi> We cannot here be ſilent, but muſt needs tell you, that ſeeing now your Papers are publiſhed to the world, we muſt expect a publike retractation, of what you have thereby ſo much diſhonoured God, and juſtly offended and grieved the Church of God, and not us onely: and had the intended treaty gone on, we ſhould have inſiſted on ſatisfaction (as we hinted to you in diſcourſe) for that diſtemper of ſpirit, that you do here and elſwhere in your Paper let forth (though then the more private might have ſerved the turn) before we could have cloſed with you in any way of accommodation. 2. But in
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:119100:140"/>
the next place you paralell us with thoſe under the Law, that cried <hi>Templum Domini, Templum Domini;</hi> though we are ſure that you cry <hi>the Church, the Church,</hi> that is <hi>Templum Domini, the Temple of the Lord,</hi> to the prejudice of the Scriptures, that are <hi>verbum Domini,</hi> the word of the Lord. 3. Then you come to compare us <hi>with the Anabaptiſts of old, of whom you ſay, when they and their Bibles were left together, what ſtrange phantaſticall opinion ſoever came in their brain, their uſuall manner was to ſay, the spirit taught it them, quoting Mr.</hi> Hooker. And yet in the beginning of your ſecond Paper, we were your <hi>dear friends,</hi> (nay more) <hi>brethren, dearly beloved to you in the Lord, to whom you returned hearty thanks, for our Anſwer full of civility towards you;</hi> and thus we might have continued in your eſteem of us, if we could have come up to your termes, in admitting of Epiſcopacy, and caſting out the ruling Elders. 4. In the next place you proceed to miſrepreſent our aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to father that upon us which is not true; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that be not ſlandering, we leave it to you to judge; for, as upon our aſſerting the Word of God alone, to be the judge of all controverſies in matters of Religion, it followes not <hi>that then we muſt take to our Bibles, and burn all other books,</hi> as you ſay; but rather being the Scriptures are the onely judge, and theſe are profound and deep, we muſt uſe the greateſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and beſt helps we can, to come to underſtand what is the will and mind of God revealed there; ſo upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, though we dare not build our faith upon ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure foundation, as the determination of Councils and Fathers, and the Churches practice, for matters of Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or any other matter in Religion; yet we are farre from abandoning or deſpiſing them, which yet is that, you here charge us with: But it is you (who attribute more unto them, then ever the great Champions for the Proteſtant cauſe did) that will be found <hi>joyning hands</hi> in this point with the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> (enquiring <hi>where was our Church before Luther?</hi> and whom, our Divines anſwering ſufficiently from the Scriptures, do yet <hi>ex ſuperabundanti</hi> prove the main points of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion, wherein they differ from them, both from Councils and Fathers) and making that plea, for that Church
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:119100:140"/>
Government for which you contend, and againſt that, which we, from the Scriptures argue for, which the Papiſts did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our Proteſtant Divines, for their unwritten traditions and ſuperſtitious ceremonies, and devotion. For you ask of us, <hi>where was our Church</hi> (you here ſure mean, where was our Presbyterian Government? elſe you take not the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to which you belong, to be the Church you are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of) before <hi>Calvin?</hi> But we anſwer you, though we need not take ſuch an <hi>high jumpe, over all the practice and ſucceſſions of the Church,</hi> as you talk of; being able, <hi>ex ſuperabundanti,</hi> to evidence it from antiquity, in the purer times of the Primitive Church after Chriſt and his Apoſtles (whereof we have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſome account already, and ſhall anon give ſome further) yet it will be ſufficient for us, and all ſound Proteſtants, if we can prove it to be as ancient, not as <hi>we liſt,</hi> but as the Scriptures of the old and new Teſtament, wherein it is to be found, and whereof we have given ſome account alſo, out of what we have in our ſecond Paper urged out of the <hi>Vindication of the Presbyterian Government</hi> by the Provinciall Aſſembly of <hi>London;</hi> and the <hi>Jus Divinum Regiminis Eccleſiaſtici,</hi> by ſome <hi>London</hi> Miniſters; and of which the Reader (and you alſo, if you would take the pains to peruſe them) may ſee more at large, not onely in Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi>'s works, but alſo in <hi>Aarons Rod bloſsoming,</hi> written by Mr. <hi>George Gilleſpi,</hi> and in <hi>the Aſſertions of the Government of Scotland</hi> (conceived by ſome to be penned by the ſame M. <hi>Gillespi,</hi> yet therein aſſiſted by Mr. <hi>Henderſon)</hi> wherein the <hi>jus Divinum</hi> of the ruling Elders office is proved, not onely from the new Teſtament, but alſo from the ould; and which books (proving the Presbyterian Government, as from Chriſt and his Apoſtles, ſo alſo from the Jewiſh ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatories, (to which ſome conceive Chriſt alludes, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. when he ſaith, <hi>tell the Chutch,)</hi> which were appointed many hundred years before Chriſt, and anſwering the oppoſers of this Government in all the materiall points, that ever were objected againſt it, by the greateſt Champions for Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy) were never yet anſwered, that we have ſeen to this day. And for this aſſiſtance (however you contemn it) yet we bleſs God; neither are we aſhamed of Mr. <hi>Henderſons</hi> anſwer
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:119100:141"/>
to his <hi>late Majeſty,</hi> telling him, that the Presbyterian Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was to be found in the Scriptures, as our Divines have anſwered the Papiſts ſufficiently, after the ſame manner, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing other matters; as we are not aſhamed neither to make this defence on the behalf of our Church. And though we thank God heartily, for thoſe farre abler <hi>diſputants</hi> and <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions</hi> of the Proteſtant cauſe, then we or any of us, have ever pretended to be (not thinking our ſelves worthy to be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned for any abilities, amongſt them) yet we deſire to know which of thoſe Champions (though they refuſed not to fight againſt the Papiſts with their own weapons, <hi>ſc.</hi> the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Fathers and Councils) did ever refuſe the Scriptures, as the ſole judge and determiner of controverſies in matters of Religion, as you do? or did they not rather ſtoutly and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refragably maintain and defend this main point of faith, againſt the adverſary? 5. But now you come to tell us, <hi>what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence you pay to the ſacred Scripture;</hi> for you ſay, <hi>you acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg it to be an infallible and unerring rule.</hi> And will not a Papiſt ſay ſo too? But let us enquire of you, will you acknowledge the Scripture to be the ſole ſupreme judge of controverſies in matters of faith? Except you come up to this, you are as yet, in regard of any reverence you pay to the Scriptures, no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then a Papiſt; nay you joyn hands with them; for they ſay, as you do; <hi>we may not cry up Scripture to the contempt and neglect of the Church, which the Scripture it ſelf teacheth men to honour and obey;</hi> and <hi>ſano ſenſu,</hi> in a right and ſound ſenſe, we ſhall ſay ſo too. But you further declare your ſelves touching this matter, and ſay, that <hi>the Scripture where it is plain ſhould guid the Church, and the Church, where there is doubt or difficulty, ſhould expound the Scriptures, as ſaith a Biſhop; and you quote in your margent</hi> BP Laud's <hi>Preface, that is not againſt</hi> Uſher <hi>but</hi> Fiſher *. <note place="margin">The Jeſuite.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>But here 1. You miſtake the Queſtion, for it is not, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Church belongeth not a Miniſtry, for the expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Scriptures? This is readily granted to her by us, as it is by our Proteſtant Divines; and that the Texts you cite in the margent will prove. 2. You plainly diſcover your opinion to be no other, then what in this point is held by the Papiſts; and is abundantly refuted by our Proteſtant Divines
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:119100:141"/>
in their writings. The matter is plainly thus, and no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; for when you ſay, <hi>where the Scripture is plain, it muſt guid the Church, but where there is a doubt or difficulty, the Church is to expound the Scriptures;</hi> you plainly inſinuate, that the Scriptute is not to be the ſole and ſupreme judge, touching controverſies in Religion; for there is no controverſie in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but the Adverſaries (be they Antitrinitarians, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, Papiſts or whomſoever) may ſay as you here do, in ſuch and ſuch points in controverſie, the Scripture is not plain, here is a doubt and difficulty, and we muſt ſtand to the Churches determination, who is in ſuch caſes to expound the Scripture; neither is the Scripture in ſuch caſes, to be the onely ſure infallible interpreter of it ſelf, to which all parties are to ſtand, and in whoſe determination alone they are to reſt, and into which our faith muſt be reſolved; which yet is that which is maintained by our Proteſtant Divines againſt the Papiſts, and of which we ſhall ſpeak more fully anon. Onely for the preſent we muſt mind you, that this aſſertion is fetcht out of the dreggs of Popery, and is ſuch an opinion as all ſound Proteſtants will diſclaim; neither do the Texts you cite in your margent, prove any ſuch a thing, Not 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15. that is uſually urged by the Papiſts, for that very opinion which you maintain, but is ſufficiently vindicated by our Divines; ſhewing, that the Church is there called, <hi>the Pillar and ground of Truth,</hi> in regard of her Miniſtry onely, by her preaching, publiſhing and defending the truth, and thereby tranſmitting it to poſterity; but not to intimate, that the Scripture in any point, where there is doubt or difficulty. did borrow authority from the Church, no more then the Edicts of Princes do from the publiſhers of them, or from the pillars and poſts to which they are affixed, that they might be the more generally known. The other Text, <hi>ſc. Cant.</hi> 1. 8. proves indeed, that the Church hath a Miniſtry committed to her, for the feeding of babes in Chriſt, as well as ſtronger men, which is not denied; but if you will ſtretch it further, its plain you wreſt it. 6. In the laſt place you urge us, with what we our ſelves granted unto Synods and Councils, acknowledging, they <hi>were inveſted with an authoritative juridicall power, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:119100:142"/>
into, try, examine, cenſure and judge of matters of Doctrine, as well as of Diſcipline, and to whoſe authority we profeſsed our ſelves to be ſubject, and to which all ought to ſubmit; urging Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for it,</hi> &amp;c. nothing whereof we do here <hi>retract, or eat our own words, caſting that out as unſound and hetrodox, as you ſay we do, which before we acknowledged was a Chriſtians duty to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe.</hi> For here you do not diſtinguiſh, betwixt the ſubmiſſion of our faith to the determination of Synods and Councils, and the ſubmiſſion of our perſons to their cenſure, in regard of any matter of Doctrine, held forth by us, or any practice. This latter ſubmiſſion we ſtill do readily yeeld unto them, and that in regard of the juridicall authority, they are inveſted with by the Ordinance of God; and this ſubmiſſion was that, we profeſſed before to yeeld unto them; and was that we ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued for. But as touching the ſubmiſſion of our faith to their determinations, or ſo as to reſolve it into any other princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples then the Word of God alone, or to build it on any other foundation, was not that reverence we ever acknowledged was to be paid to Synods and Councils, and is that which here we do profeſſedly deny. And therefore you do here again no leſs then ſlander us, when you ſay, <hi>we ſtill own ſubjection in matters of Doctrine and Diſcipline, to the judgment and determination of our Provinciall Aſsembly, and yet deny the Authority of General Councils, and the Catholique Church;</hi> whom neither we ever denied to be <hi>a guide,</hi> or their Expoſitions of Scripture to be an <hi>uſefull Comment</hi> thereon, for the better helping us to underſtand, what was Gods will revealed there, touching Church Government and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline; but denied them to be <hi>our ſure guid:</hi> and further aſſerted, <hi>the Word of God alone to be the onely rule to judge by in this, or any other controverſies in matters of Religion,</hi> (and which are the words we uſed, in that part of our Anſwer, to which you here reply) as it is a received rule amongſt Proteſtant Divines, that the onely ſure rule or guid for the interpreting of Scripture, is not Fathers, Councils, or the practice of the Church (and wherein we muſt further oppoſe you anon, giving you our reaſons for that alſo) but the Scripture it ſelf, that is the onely infallible comment or ſure guide, or (as we ſpake) interpreter. And now we leave it to the Reader to judge, how true it was
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:119100:142"/>
ſaid by you, that <hi>we ſeemed to ſubmit to our Provinciall, what we will hardly grant to a Generall Council.</hi>

                     <p>But you hitherto having no otherwiſe, then thus, oppoſed, what we had intimated to you, was to be the onely rule and ſole judge of controverſies in matters of Religion, <hi>ſc.</hi> the Word of God alone; we ſhall now proceed to give you our Reaſons (according to what we promiſed) for this aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And however, this pains to ſome may ſeem needleſs, conſidering how full our Divines are in this point in their writings againſt the Papiſts, yet we judge it neceſſary to ſay ſomething (though it be but what hath been ſaid before) that ſo we may neither ſeem to ſleight any means, we are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to uſe to reduce you from your errour; nor neglect the ſouls of thoſe that are committed to our charge; in not laying before them ſome grounds for the better eſtabliſhing them in the preſent truth. Our Reaſons then for making the Scriptures the only rule of faith and life, and ſole ſupreme judge of all controverſies in matters of Religion are briefly theſe:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argument</hi> 1. Becauſe it is the Scripture onely, or Word of God contained there, that begets divine faith and full aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance <note place="margin">The Scriptures the ſole ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme judge of all matters in Religion.</note> in matters of Religion, ſo as to remove all doubts and ſcruples; and hence it is that faith is ſaid to come by hearing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 17. <hi>i. e.</hi> from the ſenſe of Scripture truely perceived and rightly underſtood. <hi>Timothy</hi> is alſo ſaid to have gained the aſſurance of what he had learned from the Scriptures, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15, 16. neither is there any other firm foundation, whereon we can build, but the foundation of the Prophets and Apoſtles, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 20. and therefore it is the Scripture onely that is the ſole judge of controverſies, removing all doubts and ſcruples, and ſo determining the matters in difference touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Religion, in whoſe ſentence onely we can reſt, and to whoſe determination we muſt ſtand.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argument</hi> 2. If the Scriptures muſt be refuſed, as the ſole and ſupreme judge and determiner of controverſies in matters of Religion; then it is, becauſe they are either imperfect, and ſo not reaching to all caſes and matters in controverſie, or elſe becauſe they are obſcure, and ſo not ſufficiently plain for the reſolving of all doubts, whereupon there is a neceſſity ſuppoſed of appeal to ſome other judge.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="256" facs="tcp:119100:143"/>
But the Scriptures are not imperfect; for the Law and Scripture of the Old Teſtament is ſaid to be perfect, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 7. And therefore there was nothing wanting in it, that was neceſſary for the inſtruction of the people of God, under the Old Teſtament, in matters of Religion that concerned them to know; <hi>integrum,</hi> or that which <hi>is perfect;</hi> being that, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the deſcription of the <hi>Philoſopher, Cui nihil deeſt, &amp; extra quod nihil eorum quae ſunt ejus accipi poteſt,</hi> i. e. that to which nothing is wanting, and without which, nothing of thoſe things that belong unto it, can be taken. And hence it is that God did ſo ſtrictly prohibit his people of old, that they ſhould not, either adde any thing to, or detract any thing from his Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 2. and therefore much more are the Scriptures both of the Old and New Teſtament perfect; neither is there any caſe in matters of Religion needfull to be reſolved, but the determination thereof is to be found there; eſpecially conſidering, <hi>all Scripture is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for inſtruction in righteouſneſs, that the man of God may be perfect, throughly furniſhed unto all good works,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 16, 17.</p>
                     <p>And as the Scriptures are not to be accuſed of imperfection, ſo neither of obſcurity. <hi>The word of God is a lamp to our feet, and a light to our paths,</hi> Pſal. 119. 105. and hereupon our only ſure guid, as a torch or lanthorne in the night, that ſo we may be guided in the way we ſhould walk, and thereby be cautioned againſt errours on all hands. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> alſo, ſpeaking of the Scripture, calls it a <hi>more ſure word of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ſie, whereunto we ſhould do well to take heed, as to a light ſhine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a dark place,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 19. and therefore the Scripture is ſufficiently plain, for the reſolving of all doubts, and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of all controverſies in Religion. Although if in ſome things the Scripture be obſcure, yet this is no ſufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for the refuſal of it, as the ſole determiner of controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies; perſpicuity not being of the eſſence and nature of a rule, but certainty and authority; the Laws of men being often obſcure, as Lawyers know, and yet not thereupon ceaſing to be a rule.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argument</hi> 3. God is the author of Scripture, <hi>all Scripture
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:119100:143"/>
being given by inſpiration from him,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 16. <hi>received by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate divine revelation,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 21. <hi>and is the word of Chriſt,</hi> Col. 3. 16. and therefore is the teſtimony, and ſentence of God himſelf the ſupreme Judge, and therefore is to be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by all, to be the only ſure guid and determiner of all controverſies in Religion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argument</hi> 4. Nothing is to be believed in matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and to be received as from God, or to be taught in the Church, but what is confirmed by the teſtimony of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; whence it was, that in the old time, the people were ſent to the Law and to the Teſtimonies, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8. 20. <hi>Paul</hi> taught nothing but what was to be found in the <hi>Prophets and Moſes,</hi> Act. 26. 22. and hence it was alſo, that the <hi>Bereans</hi> were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for trying by the touchſtone of the Scriptures, what they heard from <hi>Paul,</hi> Act. 17. 11. And therefore the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are the only rule and ſupreme Judge of all controverſies in Religion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argument</hi> 5. The people of God are commanded, that they turn not aſide, either to the right hand or to the left, from that path that is chalked forth in the Scriptures for them to walk in, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. 32. and Chap. 17. 20. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 1. 7. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Scripture is the only ſure rule in matters of Religion, to which we muſt exactly keep, and from which we muſt not in the leaſt thing turn aſide.</p>
                     <p>Many more reaſons might be here urged, but we judge theſe ſufficient, and ſo, having diſpatcht what we promiſed, we ſhall now proceed.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. For you, having not urged Arguments, againſt the rule by us propounded, for the determining controverſies in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, but only vented againſt us the diſtemper of your ſpirit for that propoſal, do now further declare your ſelves, touching what you would have to be the judge, and rule for interpretation of the Scripture; and do adde unto the univerſal <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ractice of the Church, mentioned in your firſt Paper, <hi>the Churches expoſition,</hi> meaning the expoſition of <hi>Councils, and unanimous conſent of Fathers,</hi> as you here declare your ſelves: concerning which we ſhall, 1. Propound the true ſtate of the Queſtion betwixt you and us; 2. And then
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:119100:144"/>
urge ſome Arguments againſt the rule by you here made; 3. and laſtly, We ſhall anſwer what you have here to ſay for your opinion. As touching the firſt; we do here declare our ſelves, that we do readily grant, <hi>the Church may expound the Scripture, though</hi> (as we ſaid in our anſwer, which you here acknowledge) <hi>it be tied to the rule of Gods word in ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, as Judges to the Law;</hi> and ſo therefore the Churches expoſition may and is to be made uſe of, as a meanes appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God, that we might underſtand the word, where there is <hi>a doubt or difficulty,</hi> but we muſt not allow what you further adde, <hi>ſc.</hi> that we <hi>are bound up by the Churches expoſition, as we are</hi> (according to what you ſay) <hi>to thoſe caſes in the Law, which are the judgement and expoſition of the Judges upon the dark places of the ſame:</hi> neither muſt we cloſe with you, when you ſay, <hi>the Churches expoſition and practice is our rule in ſuch caſes, and the beſt rule too;</hi> or that <hi>when there is a difference about interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Scripture, we muſt neceſſarily make another judge and rule for interpretation of Scripture, beſides Scripture,</hi> as you ſpeak, the Scripture it ſelf being in ſuch a caſe, the only ſure inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter of it ſelf; the doubtfull and hard places thereof being to be expounded by the more plain. Further we do here declare, that we grant, the Church is a judge, touching matters of Religion in controverſie, or touching the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of doubtfull or difficult places of Scripture, but a miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Judge only; and not the rule for its interpretation, as you ſpeak; or ſuch a judge from which there is no appeal, no not to the Scriptureit ſelf, as you intimate. Again the Church is ſuch a judge, to which all parties ought to ſubmit, in regard of her juridical authority, to be cenſured by her in regard of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or practices; but not ſuch a judge, to whoſe determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we muſt ſubmit our faith, or reſolve it into her ſentence. In a word, we grant unto the Church a Miniſtry, but not a dominion over our faith, nor make her interpretation of the Scripture, where there is a doubt or difficulty, the rule of faith or practice. And if you had given to the Church no more, nor had aſcribed to the Scriptures in this caſe too little, we ſhould not have had this for a controverſie, that is now a great matter in difference betwixt you and us. For whereas
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:119100:144"/>
you reject the rule propounded by us in our anſwer, touching the determining of controverſies in Religion, <hi>ſc.</hi> the word of God alone, and notwithſtanding our reaſons there urged, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt your adding the univerſal and conſtant practice of the Church, unto the word of God, to make up the rule to judge by in matters of this nature, yet do here profeſſedly adhere, to what you did but ſeem to inſinuate, in your firſt Paper: and becauſe we had propounded the Scripture only, as the only ſure rule to walk by, you hereupon (as hath been ſaid) rail upon us, calling us <hi>Scripturiſts,</hi> and ſcorn and ſcoff at us, for making the word of God alone the <hi>rule of faith and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;</hi> we hereupon cannot but conceive, you aſcribe a deal more to the Church, then a meer Miniſtery, ſetting up her determination, for the rule of interpreting Scripture, and iſſuing of controverſies, and take away from the Scripture, that which you ſhould yeild unto it, even to be the only ſure rule for the interpreting it ſelf: for though you here acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that the Church in expounding Scripture, is <hi>tied to the rule of Gods word in ſuch proceedings, as Judges to the Law,</hi> yet you ſay, <hi>we were concluded and bound up by her expoſition,</hi> and therefore though ſhe be tyed in her expounding of Scripture; according to this conceſſion, yet by this aſſertion it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that we are bound to believe, ſhe hath rightly expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Scripture, according to her duty: for you ſay, <hi>her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and practice is our rule and beſt rule too,</hi> and that <hi>we neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily make another judge, and rule for interpretation of Scripture, or elſe we prove nothing,</hi> and that elſe <hi>we give way to private interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> (which is the Popiſh falſe gloſs, upon the Text point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at in that expreſſion) and anon you tell of <hi>another judge and rule, beſides the Scripture, that is to be ſubmitted unto, even ſuch as the Papiſts themſelves cannot ex<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1+ letters">

and the unanimous conſent of Fathers, as to the rule, whereby they would be tryed; ſo you with them, betake your ſelves to theſe, and refuſe to be tryed by the Scriptures, as the ſole judg, becauſe thence it is manifeſt, that that Epiſcopacy, that you are for, is quite caſhiered, the whole current of the Scripture of the New Teſtament, making a Biſhop and a Presbyter all one.</p>
                     <p>But the Queſtion betwixt us being thus ſtated; as we gave our reaſons even now, why the Scriptures were to be the only judge of controverſies, and rule of faith and life; ſo we ſhall now give our reaſons, why the Churches expoſition, the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous conſent of Fathers and general Councils, are not to be the rule of its interpretation, much leſs the beſt rule, where there is a doubt or difficulty, as you aſſert.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argument,</hi> 1. Becauſe it is God only, that is the author of <note place="margin">Councils and Fathers not the rule of the Scriptures in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation.</note> Scripture; <hi>all Scripture being given by inſpiration of God,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 16. It is he only that is the chief Law-giver and Doctor of the Church, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 12. <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 10. and therefore he only, ſpeaking in the Scripture, and in the hearts of his people by his Spirit, is the ſupream and infallible interpreter of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, every one being the beſt interpreter of his own words, and the Law-giver beſt underſtanding the meaning of the Law he makes; and being the Scriptures cannot be interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and underſtood, but by that ſame Spirit whereby they are written, whence that of <hi>Bernard, Nunquam Pauli ſenſum ingredieris, niſi Pauli ſpiritum imbiberis;</hi> and again, <hi>Nunquam Davidem intelliges, donec ipſâ experientiâ Pſalmorum affectus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dueris:</hi> and therefore the expoſition of the Church, the una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous conſent of Fathers and general Councils, are not the beſt rule for the interpreting of the Scripture.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argument</hi> 2. Becauſe no men can be ſufficient interpreters of the Scripture, ſo, as when there is a doubt or difficulty, by the interpoſition of their authority, they can remove it, and determine the controverſie about it; becauſe then they ſhould have a dominion over the ſoul and over faith, which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle denies, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 24. yea then faith, <hi>which ſtandeth not in the wiſdome of men, but in the power of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 5. ſhould be reſolved into the ſentence and judgement of men; and
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:119100:145"/>
their ſentence be the matter of our faith, or the thing that were to be believed, and whereon our faith were to be built; which were quite to overthrow it, and to bring in an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane faith in the room of a divine. But on the contrary, when there is any controverſie about any matter of Religion, and ſo about the interpretation of any Text of Scripture, the controverſie is to be determined, and the doubt and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to be removed, not by the authority of any men, but by the authority of God, and of the Scriptures. Whence it was, that the Fathers of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, diſputing with <hi>Arrius,</hi> preſſed him with the authority of Scriptures, and condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him by the teſtimonies thereof. And therefore not the unanimous conſent of the Fathers, and of Councils, is to be the rule for the interpreting of Scriptures.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argument</hi> 3. The unanimous conſent of Fathers and Councils cannot be the rule for interpreting of the Scriptures, becauſe then this ſhould alwayes have been the rule, it being of the nature of that which is a rule, that it be alwayes one, and that ſure, firme, and perpetual: but that this was not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes a rule is manifeſt, becauſe there was once a time, when there were no writings of the Fathers extant, nor when there had been any general Councils; the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> that was the firſt general Council of all other, after the death of the Apoſtles, not having been convened till above three hundred yeares after Chriſt, and many of the Fathers having written nothings till four hundred yeares after Chriſt, and ſome not till five hundred or ſix hundred yeares after him; and ſo before that time, the unanimous conſent of Fathers and Councils, could not be the rule of interpreting Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Beſides after the Fathers had written, yet there is not in all things an unanimous conſent amongſt them, in their interpreting of Scripture, as might be evidenced by ſeveral and ſundry examples. You your ſelves told us, <hi>that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are different, in the ſenſe and interpretation of the word (Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery) in the Scripture expreſſion,</hi> 1 Tim. 4. <hi>The Latin Fathers generally, as Hierome, Ambroſe, Primaſius, Anſelme and others, taking this word (Preſbytery) for the function which Timothy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, when he was made Biſhop or Prieſt,</hi> as you expreſs it.
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:119100:146"/>
                        <hi>The Greek Fathers as Ignatius, Chryſoſtome, Theodoret, Theophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lact, Oecumenius and ſome others, and ſome few of the Latines alſo, taking it for the company of Presbyters.</hi> We ſhall adde only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother example, <hi>Origen, Jerome, Athanaſius, Ambroſe,</hi> do ſo interpret thoſe words of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. where he ſaith, <hi>I am carnal, ſold under ſin,</hi> &amp;c. as that they ſay, <hi>Paul</hi> doth not there ſpeak concerning himſelf, but in the perſon of a man not regenerated, whereas <hi>Auguſtine</hi> will have it to be underſtood (as indeed it ought to be, touching a man, that is regenerated; and ſo, that <hi>Paul</hi> there ſpeakes of himſelf, as he moſt certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doth. Many more examples of this kind might be given, but by theſe we may ſufficiently conjecture of the reſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argument</hi> 4. Adde unto the former, that the Fathers have ſundry of them erred, which is ſo manifeſt to him that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant in their writings, that it will not be denyed; as if any ſhould be ſo impudent as to deny it, it is eaſie to make it good in manifold inſtances: yea ſome general Councils have erred, as that Council held at <hi>Ariminum,</hi> that eſtabliſhed the <hi>Arrian</hi> hereſie; and the ſecond Council of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the <hi>Eutichian</hi> hereſie; and the ſecond Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> that eſtabliſhed the worſhipping of Images, which is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in the Law of God. Whereupon the Fathers have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, that the authority of Councils was only ſo far of force, as their determinations are agreeable to Scriptures; and that there lyes an appeal from all unto the Scripture.

corrupted. This is clear, becauſe there have been many writers heretofore, that have been publikely adorned with the title of the Fathers, that are now rejected as heterodox, and unworthy to be called by the names they go under, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of if you doubt, learned <hi>Voetius</hi> doth afford you a catalogue. That there are alſo many ſuppoſitious and ſpurious works attributed to the genuine and true Fathers, and publiſhed with their works, which ſome receive, others reject, others do doubt concerning; is ſo cleare and manifeſt, that it will not be queſtioned by any, that ever ſaluted the Fathers writings, and had either ſound judgement of his own, or would believe the cenſures of the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed concerning them, as of <hi>Rivet, Eraſmus, Perkins</hi> and others; and which is ſo clear, that the Papiſts themſelves, as <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, Cajetan</hi> and others will not deny it; and, as if it were to our purpoſe might be particularly proved, by inſtancing in the ſuppoſitious writings attributed to <hi>Ignatius, Cyprian, Baſil, Ambroſe, Hierome, Chryſostome, Auguſtine,</hi> and others of the moſt approved Fathers; and from all which it will follow, that the unanimous conſent of the Fathers, cannot be a rule for the interpreting of Scripture; it being that which will be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted concerning ſome, whether they be not meer feigned Fathers; and concerning ſundry of the works, that are attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the genuine Fathers, (and in which ſuch Scriptures may be interpreted, where there is doubt and difficulty) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be not ſuppoſitious.</p>

To ſay nothing of the difficulties or obſcuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the genuine Fathers and their genuine writings, by reaſon of phraſes now grown out of uſe, Idiotiſms, Hiſtories and Antiquities, that make them the more hard to us of theſe times, and ſo their interpretations of Scriptures often more difficult to be underſtood, then the Scriptures that they inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret: this alſo is very conſiderable, that it will be out of the compaſs and reach of the moſt perſons of ordinary rank, to procure all the writings of the Fathers and Councils, that are yet extant: as we do not beleeve, that any of you are ſo well ſtored, as that you have ſuch a Library, wherein all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers or moſt of them might be conſulted: which yet were
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:119100:147"/>
neceſſary to be procured, if their unanimous conſent muſt be the rule for interpretation of Scripture, when there is a doubt or difficulty. And if ſome perſons might be found of that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, as to procure the Works of all the Fathers, yet it is not eaſie to imagin, how even the Learned, though Divines, much leſs the ſimple and ignorant, could ever be able to reade over all their Works, compare all the Fathers together, and their interpretations, that ſo they might, when there was a doubt or difficulty, gather what was the unanimous conſent of the Fathers, touching the interpretation of a Text, the ſenſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we queſtioned. And hereupon it will follow, that what you propound as <hi>the rule,</hi> yea <hi>and the beſt rule too,</hi> for inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting of Scripture, is ſo farre from being ſuch, that it is a very unfit and unmeet rule, being ſuch, as few or none, if any at all, are able in all caſes or the moſt to make uſe of.</p>
                     <p>But by this time, we doubt not, notwithſtanding your great confidence touching the ſureneſs of your rule, that it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, from the reaſons we have given, (unto which we might add many more, if there were need) that your rule for the interpretation of the Scriptures, participates not of the nature, of what is to be a rule: and therefore, however the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Church, Fathers and Councils, is not to be deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed, yet it is not to be made a rule; but that the onely ſure rule for the interpreting of the Scriptures, is the Scripture it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe you alledge ſomething for your aſſertion, we ſhall now in the laſt place, examine it, of what nature and ſtrength it is. And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                        </gap>, although his aſſertion is more limited then yours, as from the words you cite is clear and manifeſt. And as touching that, which his words are alledged for, we muſt ſay, that ſuch a Church Government, as is not found inſtituted in Scripture, in regard of the ſubſtantials of it, is therefore contrary to the commands of Scripture, becauſe not found inſtituted there: and this we affirm, touching that Epiſcopall Government that you plead for; that ſuperiority of a Biſhop above a Presbyter, in regard of order and juriſdiction, being a meer device of man, without and againſt Scripturall war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:119100:147"/>
as it was that, that was unknown to the primitive Church in the more ancient and purer times, and of which afterward. 2. But you further add and ſay, that except your rule for interpreting of Scripture, be admitted of, <hi>we ſhall ſeem to abound in our own ſenſe, and to utter our own fancies or deſires, to be believed on our bare word, and ſo to give way to private inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation; whereas we ſhould deliver that ſenſe, which hath been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foretime given by our forefathers and forerunners in the Chriſtian faith:</hi> unto which we ſay, that whether it be the interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that we ourſelves ſhall give of Scripture, or it be the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of others, however Fathers or Councils, and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners in the Chriſtian faith; yet if it be an interpretation inferred, or brought to the Scripture, and not found in the Scripture; the uttering of that interpretation, is the uttering our own, or other mens fancies, and ſo is that private inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of Scripture, which the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 
                        <hi>Epiſt. ch.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 20. condemns, and to whoſe words there, you do here point; it being the Holy Ghoſt the author of Scripture, whoſe interpretation is that publike interpretation that the whole Church and every member thereof is to give heed to, and is that which is oppoſed to the private interpretation mentioned, as the Apoſtle ſhews, <hi>ver.</hi> 21. in the words following. But ſeeing you do here urge the very popiſh argument, and that text which they quote, touching the rule they make for inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of Scripture, in direct oppoſition to our Proteſtant Divines; it is hence very clear, that your opinion, touching the rule of interpreting of the Scriptures and judg of controverſies in matters of Religion (which you make to be the Churches expoſition, and conſent of Fathers and Councils) is the very ſame with theirs, and wherein, you approve not your ſelves to be either ſound Proteſtants, or to own the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> againſt the Papiſts in this particular. 3. Yet you go on, and urge another argument: for when there is a difference about interpretation of Scripture, not to admit for a rule, the expoſition of the Church, conſent of Fathers and Councils, you ſay that is <hi>dominari fidei,</hi> to Lord it over the faith of others: but we ſay, (as we have ſhewed before) that to impoſe a neceſſity of admitting the interpretation given by
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:119100:148"/>
the Church, Fathers, Councils; when it is not evident from the Text ſo expounded, either the words of it, ſcope or other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of it, the things going before, or following after, or from ſome other Texts, with which it is compared; this is certainly <hi>dominari fidei,</hi> to Lord it over the faith of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: and which <hi>Paul,</hi> though ſo great an Apoſtle, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately and infallibly inſpired, would not preſume to do, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But thus ſay you, <hi>the beſt and ableſt defenders of our Proteſtant Religion defended it againſt the Papiſts, though out of the word of God too, giving the ſenſe, which the Fathers unanimouſly in the Primitive Church and Councils gave.</hi> But this is not the queſtion, whether our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines defended the Proteſtant Religion againſt the Papiſts, not onely out of the Word of God, but from the teſtimonie alſo of Fathers and Councils; but whether they did ever make the unanimous conſent of the Fathers and Councils, the judg of controverſies or rule for interpreting of Scripture? He that ſhall hold the affirmative here, doth plainly ſhew, he is a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to the writings of the beſt and ableſt defenders of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion. We ſhall readily grant that our Divines do <hi>ex ſuper abundanti</hi> defend the truth againſt the Papiſts, from the teſtimony of Fathers and Councils; but did never aſſert, that the defence of it from the Scriptures alone was not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, as they would never have quarrelled with the Papiſts, touching the judg of controverſies, and the rule for interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Scripture, if they would have been contented to have ſtood to its determination.

Beſides it is to be obſerved, that it was matters of Doctrine that he and other Proteſtant writers did offer to defend againſt the Papiſts, from the teſtimony of Fathers and Councils, not matters touching Church Government and diſcipline, which began ſooner to be

Having put you to prove, what that Church Government is, which is ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant to the will of God, and univerſal practice of Primitive Churches, we thus declared our ſelves. <hi>For our parts,</hi> we ſaid, <hi>we think it will be very hard for you, or any others, to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate out of any records of antiquity, what was the univerſal pract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice of Primitive Churches, for the whole ſpace of the firſt three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares after Chriſt, or the greateſt part thereof, (excepting ſo much as is left upon record, in the Scriptures of the new Teſtament) the monuments of Antiquity that concerne theſe times, (for the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:119100:149"/>
part of them) being both imperfect, and far from ſhewing us what was the univerſal practice of the Church then, (though the practices of ſome Churches may be mentioned) and likewiſe very queſtionable. At leaſt it will not be eaſie to aſſure us, that ſome of thoſe that go under the names of the moſt approved Authors of thoſe times, are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther spurious nor corrupted.</hi> From the words of our anſwer thus recited, it is manifeſt, we did not <hi>unâ liturâ,</hi> blot out all records and monuments of Antiquity, for the ſpace of three hundred yeares after Chriſt: we only ſaid, they were imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; and ſaid it would be hard for you, or any others, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate out of any records of Antiquity, what was the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal practice of Primitive Churches, for the whole ſpace of the firſt three hundred yeares after Chriſt, or the greateſt part thereof. And is not this manifeſt to him that is conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant in Eccleſiaſtical ſtory? Doth not <hi>Baronius</hi> himſelf deſpair of making up any perfect ſtory of a good part of this time next unto the Apoſtles dayes? And if it had been eaſie for you to have demonſtrated, what was the univerſal practice of the Church for the whole or greateſt part of this time, why did you not begin your demonſtration hereof ſooner, then from the Council of <hi>Nice?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again we ſaid, that it would not be eaſie for to aſſure us, that ſome of the works, that go under the names of the moſt approved Authors of thoſe times, are neither ſpurious nor corrupted; but we did not, as you charge u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And therefore this is but another of your wonted ſlanders, and which through out your Paper are but too common with you. But as to the thing it ſelf, who knowes not, but in the Primitive times there were many ſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious works put forth, under the names even of the Apoſtles, (as appears from 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 2.) and bleſſed Martyrs, that yet are generally rejected, as none of theirs, and of which ſort were thoſe many falſe Goſpels, that we read of, as of <hi>Thomas, Andrew, Nicodemus,</hi> and S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

We might inſtance in many others, as we ſhall come anon to ſpeak, touching the Epiſtles that go under the name of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and unto which we had ſpecial reference in the paſſages we uſed, that you here except againſt, but yet without the leaſt reflection upon ſo glorious a Confeſſor of the faith of Chriſt, as he was. And ſuch as are equal judges, and who know, what were the practices of Impoſtors in the Primitive times, in putting out their own corrupt writings, under the names of the Apoſtles and bleſſed Martyrs of thoſe times, that thereby they might gain belief to their errors, will be farre from cenſuring us, <hi>to be void of all modeſty, and ſhewing thereby no great ſtore either of judgement or honeſty,</hi> as you here do, becauſe we ſaid ſome of the workes, that go under the names of the moſt approved Authors of thoſe times, <hi>were spurious or corrupted,</hi> conſidering what <hi>Rivet, Cocus</hi> in his <hi>cenſur a patrum,</hi> and <hi>Perkins</hi> in his preparatives to the demonſtration of the probleme, and other learned men do ſay touching this matter: and we may here well ſay to you, that you had ſhewed more judgement and honeſty your ſelves, if you had not cenſured us, as perſons deſtitute of both, and alſo <hi>all modeſty,</hi> for that, which all thoſe, that read the Fathers with any meaſure of judgement, will readily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge.</p>

chiefly inſiſt on any of the words, <hi>Patriarch, Primate, or Archbiſhop,</hi> at all there uſed; only it is decreed, that the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Alexandria</hi> (he is not called the <hi>Patriarch,</hi> as you call him) have power over <hi>Egypt, Lybia, and Pentapolis.</hi> We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the word <hi>(Metropolitane)</hi> is uſed in this Canon, but not any of the other above-mentioned; the like whereunto is to be obſerved, touching the ſeventh Canon by you cited. And yet we lay no great ſtreſs on this, that theſe words are not there found, but hint only thus much to you by the way, who take advantage at us in regard of words, though with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reaſon; but ſhall grant unto you, that the things under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by thoſe words, may be there found. As touching the thirteenth, which you here quote, that ſpeakes nothing at all touching the buſineſs, but wholly concernes the lapſed <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techumeni.</hi> And whereas you cite the twenty fifth, twenty ſixth, and twenty ſeventh Canons of this Council, you do therein both wrong this Council, and your ſelves, in father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon them ſuppoſititious Canons, there being not above twenty Canons that are genuine. Indeed it is well obſerved by <hi>Lucas Oſiander</hi> (after he had recited in his Epitome of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Hiſtory, <hi>Centur.</hi> 4. <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. the twenty Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of this Council, and which only he judged to be genuine) that there are other beſides theſe, that are read in ſome ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſititious writings of the Fathers, (under the names of <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius and Ambroſe)</hi> but he judges them, and that rightly, to be falſly aſcribed to the Synod of <hi>Nice.</hi> Perhaps you judged us to be ſo little converſant in the Fathers and Councils, as that we ſhould have let all theſe things paſs for currant; if other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, we ſee you are ſo addicted to the Epiſcopall cauſe, that you matter not, ſo you can make it out, though it be out of ſuppoſititious writings. 2. As to the main thing you cite this Council for, and that which indeed is chiefly to be here inſiſted on, <hi>ſc.</hi> the ancient cuſtome that the ſixth Canon ſpeakes of, touching the power and dignity of the <hi>Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes,</hi> (which yet was not ſuch as you imagine, at the firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing them, and of which more anon.) Let it be granted, as you would have it, that this Council did not conſtitute and create thoſe <hi>Metropolitans,</hi> but confirme them, and what
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:119100:152"/>
power and dignity they had before, according to an ancient cuſtome, yet we ſay, that ancient cuſtome is to be limited in in regard of its Antiquity. And 1. It cannot referre ſo high as to the times of the Apoſtles, there being then no <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan</hi> Biſhops, they being never at all mentioned in the New Teſtament, either by that name, or the thing thereby ſignified. 2. Neither can it referre to the age next unto the Apoſtles, becauſe in that age, and a good while after, a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop and Presbyter were all one. We ſhall for the proof of this, firſt mention a very obſervable paſſage in a Letter, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the Lord <hi>Digby</hi> unto Sir <hi>Kenelmne Digby,</hi> and which, for the obſervableneſs of it is cited by others <note n="‖" place="margin">See the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of <hi>London</hi> in their <hi>Jus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinum Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rij Evangelici, part</hi> 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 107.

His words are theſe; <q>He that will reduce the Church now, to the forme of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the moſt Primitive times, ſhould not take in my opinion the beſt nor wiſeſt courſe; I am ſure not the ſafeſt: for he would be found pecking toward the Presbytery of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which for my part I believe, in point of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, hath a greater reſemblance, then either yours or ours, to the firſt age of Chriſts Church; and yet it is never a whit the better for it, ſince it was a forme not choſen for the beſt, but impoſed by adverſity under oppreſſion, which in the beginning forced the Church from what it wiſht, to what it might; not ſuffering the dignity and State Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical, which rightly belonged unto it, and which ſoon afterward, upon the leaſt <hi>lucida intervâlla,</hi> ſhone forth ſo gloriouſly in the happier, as well as more Monarchical condition of Epiſcopacy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </q> You ſee this Gentleman, who was firme for Monarchical Epiſcopacy, doth yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that in the moſt Primitive times, and firſt age of the Church, that kind of Epiſcopacy had no footing; and that the Presbyterian Government, as it is in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and ſo conſequently as it is in other reformed Churches, and with us, is nearer to the Primitive patterne of the Church, then that Epiſcopal Governement, which you would prove from the Council of <hi>Nice.</hi> And therefore in thoſe times there was no ſuch ſuperiority of a Biſhop over a Presbyter, no <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops</hi>
                        <pb n="275" facs="tcp:119100:152"/>
and <hi>Metropolitans,</hi> or <hi>Primates</hi> and <hi>Patriarehs,</hi> as you ſpeak of, and for which you quote this ſixth Canon of the Council of <hi>Nice.</hi> But if you would peruſe <hi>Blondellus</hi> his <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologia pro ſententiâ Hieronymi de Epiſcopis &amp; Presbyteris,</hi> he would give you a particular and large account, touching this matter; he undertaking to prove (as he is a man of vaſt reading) that untill the year 140. or thereabout, there was not any Biſhop over Presbyters. And in the dayes of <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carpe,</hi> we find in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> but two orders of Miniſtery mentioned, <hi>ſc.</hi> Biſhops and Deacons, according to what <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtle to the Church had ſignified more anciently. Hear his own words, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, i. e. <hi>therefore you ought to abſtain from all theſe things, being ſubject to the Presbyters and Deacons, as unto God and Chriſt.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this ancient cuſtome, mentioned in this ſixth Canon of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> which you quote, muſt hereupon be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited and reſtrained, in regard of ancientneſs, and is not to be underſtood, ſo as to referre to the whole ſpace of 327. years after Chriſt, or thereabout, before its aſſembling; although the cuſtome of appointing <hi>Metropolitans</hi> before, might be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ancient comparatively with thoſe cuſtomes, which were but ſprung up more lately, or were very new. And though we ſhall not undertake to ſhew, what was the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal and conſtant practice of the Church, for either the whole ſpace of the firſt three hundred yeares after Chriſt, or the greateſt part thereof, (though it concerned you, who are ſo confident, that <hi>the whole ſtream</hi> of teſtimonies to be produced, ſhewing the unanimous conſent of Fathers, and the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal and conſtant practice of the Church, even up to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles dayes, <hi>runs ſo for Epiſcopacy, that there is not the leaſt rivulet for any others,</hi> to have made this out) yet this we may ſay, that Epiſcopacy did not grow up to that height, that it was in, at that time when the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> aſſembled, all at once, but by ſteps and degrees; and that it was then no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like to what it grew up to afterward; and further, that however thoſe godly Fathers, that did firſt ſet it up, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards upheld it, did ſo out of a good intention; yet that
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:119100:153"/>
therein they were but ſubſervient, to what afterward, was effected in the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> to lift up Antichriſt into his ſeat; and which is not much to be wondred at, whenas the Apoſtle tells us, that in his dayes the myſtery of iniquity did then already work; and that good men may be inſtrumental, though unwittingly, to promote and advance a very ill and bad deſigne; God therein leaving them to themſelves, and he thereby in his ſecret and unſearchable providence, though juſt, holy, and wiſe, bringing that about, which he had before appointed in his eternal counſel. And yet for all this, we do averre, that however, as <hi>Hierome</hi> 
                        <note n="‖" place="margin">See his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary upon the Epiſtle to <hi>Titus.</hi>
                        </note> doth well obſerve, at the firſt, <hi>a Biſhop and a Presbyter were the ſame, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the inſtinct of the Devil, there were contentions in Religion, and it was ſaid amongſt the people, I am of Paul, I of Apollo, I of Cephas, the Churches were governed by the common counſell of the Presbyters; but that after every one thought, that thoſe were his, which he did baptize, not Chriſts; it was decreed throughout the whole world, that one of the Presbyters ſhould be choſen, and ſet over the reſt, unto whom all the care of the Church ſhould belong, and the ſeeds of ſchiſmes taken away.</hi> Yet not only in that age, but long afterward, as alſo long before the aſſembling of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> (that ſpeakes of <hi>Metropolitans,</hi> and confirming their power) a Biſhop and Presbyter were acknowledged to be one order of Miniſtery; as they did alſo joyn with the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, after their ſetting up in the Governement of the Church, as is acknowledged and proved by Dr. <hi>Uſher,</hi> in his reduction of Epiſcopacy to the forme of Synodical Governement in the ancient Church; and which indeed, is that, which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by your ſelves. For you confeſſed before, that <hi>Ignatius, Chryſoſtome, Theodoret, Theophilact, Oecumenius, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Greek Fathers, with ſome of the Latines alſo,</hi> did take the word (Presbytery) 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. <hi>for the company of Presbyters,</hi> i. e. <hi>Biſhops who lay hands on the new made Biſhops or Prieſts,</hi> (as you expreſs it) making Biſhops and Presbyters mutually to expound each other, as hath been already obſerved.

But <hi>David Blondellus,</hi> in his <hi>Apologia pro ſententiâ Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymi,</hi> doth clear this up ſo fully, in that his large Treatiſe, penned on purpoſe, to ſhew what concurrence of Antiquity there is for this opinion of <hi>Hierome;</hi> that we believe thoſe that are unprejudiced, that will but take the paines to read and weigh what he there preſents, will readily grant, that long before the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> and long after, it was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, that a Biſhop and Presbyter are one order of Miniſtery. We have thus ſaid, that which we judge ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient unto the Canons themſelves, that you cite out of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> and particularly to the ſixth Canon of that Council, on which you lay the greateſt weight, and ſhall now proceed to examine what follows</p>
                     <p n="4">4. For you will have the words <gap reason="foreign">

Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> in his Preparatives to the demonſtration of the Probleme, obſerves that ſeaven Epiſtles of his, <hi>Hierome</hi> and <hi>Euſebius,</hi> lib. 3. cap. 35, &amp; 36. rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon for true; but now they are increaſed unto twelve; five whereof he judges to be counterfeit, and theſe to be, 1. <hi>ad Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam;</hi> 2. <hi>ad Tarſenſes;</hi> 3. <hi>ad Hieron;</hi> 4. <hi>ad Antiochenos;</hi> 5. <hi>ad Philippenſes.</hi> Dr. <hi>Uſher,</hi> that Reverend and Learned Antiqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, acknowledgeth onely ſix of theſe Epiſtles to be genuine, and ſaith, the other ſix are ſpurious; and of thoſe ſix that he acknowledgeth, he ſaith, they are depraved and corrupted. Nay Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> obſerves, that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelf confeſſeth of theſe Epiſtles, that the Greek copies are corrupted.

And this was the reaſon of thoſe expreſſions, we uſed in our Anſwer, when we ſaid, <hi>it would not be eaſie to aſſure us, that ſome Works, that go under the Names of the moſt approved Authors of the Primitive times (referring there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in after a more especiall manner to the Epiſtles of Ignatius) are neither ſpurious nor corrupted.</hi> But hence it will follow, that what is alleadged by you out of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> for the ſupport of the Epiſcopall cauſe, is not of that waight, as to prove, what
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:119100:154"/>
was the practice of the Church in the time of the true <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius;</hi> much leſs to prove, what was the univerſall practice of the Primitive Church, long before the aſſembling of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> or to evidence that that Council in the 6th Canon, had any reference to the words of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> which you cite, and which might as well be foyſted into his works afterwards, as other things; and ſo nothing thence to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, either with the ſhew of any certainty, or of any good meaſure of probability.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Now whereas you will have theſe ancient cuſtomes touching the power and priviledges of the Metrapolitans, and Patriarchs, to be <hi>deduced from St. Marke the Evangeliſt, who, you ſay, was not onely Biſhop of Alexandria, but of the Churches of Egipt, Lybia and Pentapolis, and will have the ſubordination of all inferiour Officers in the Church to the Biſhop in every Dioceſs, of the Biſhop in every Province to the Metropolitan, of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan in every region to the Patriarch or Primate; theſe ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Powers</hi> (as you call them) <hi>and ſubjection, to be defined and aſſerted by the ancient Canons, yea the moſt ancient, even immemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall Apoſtolicall tradition and cuſtome:</hi> you muſt either prove that the cuſtomes, ſtanding Powers, and ſubjection, that you ſpeak of, are warranted, defined, and aſſerted by the Canon of Scripture, which you will never be able to do: or elſe you do hereby intimate, that you would have it to be believed, that there are ſome cuſtomes and traditions, that are Apoſtolicall, and to be received as ſuch, that are not found written in the Canon of the Scripture. But by this aſſertion you gratifie the Papiſts,, and open a door to let into the Church, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny unwritten traditions, they would obtrude upon it, under the ſpecious name and title of Apoſtolicall traditions: though you might have known, they are abundantly therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuted by our Divines, that yet were never anſwered by them, or any other patrons of unwritten traditions. And up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this account we hope we ſhall be ſufficiently excuſed, though we forbear to either examin, or ſay any thing parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly to the Councils, and Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> that you cite for this purpoſe. But as touching <hi>Marke</hi> the Evangeliſt, whom you will have to be, not onely Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> but alſo of
<pb n="082" facs="tcp:119100:155"/>
                        <hi>Egypt, Lybia</hi> and <hi>Pent apolis</hi> alſo; you do herein aſſert things inconſiſtent, <hi>ſc.</hi> that he was an Evangeliſt, and yet an ordinary Biſhop. For Evangeliſts properly were extraordinary Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, extraordinarily employd in Preaching of the Goſpel, without any ſetled reſidence upon any one charge; were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions of the Apoſtles, and under the Apoſtles had the care of all Churches, and in which ſenſe <hi>Mark</hi> was an Evangeliſt, as well as in regard of the Goſpel which he wrote. But Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops were Officers that were ordinary, and fixed to one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular charge, neither did they ordinarily travell with the Apoſtles from place to place, as the Evangeliſts did: Neither could Evangeliſts be any more called Biſhops properly, then the Apoſtles could be ſo called; who were not ſuch <hi>formally,</hi> but onely <hi>eminently</hi> and <hi>virtually.</hi> But as touching <hi>Euſebius,</hi> whom you cite, <hi>Scaliger</hi> ſaith concerning him, that he read ancient Hiſtories <hi>parum attentè.</hi> But further you are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that the Apoſtles themſelves were called Biſhops in thoſe times: and yet they could not be ſo called properly, as is proved by Mr. <hi>Banes</hi> in his <hi>Dioceſan Triall</hi> 
                        <note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>queſt.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 29.</note>, who there gives reaſons, why Apoſtles neither were, nor might be both Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and Biſhops properly. We ſhall onely urge one of the reaſons there mentioned, which alſo doth ſtrongly prove, that <hi>Mark</hi> the Evangeliſt, neither was, nor could be an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Biſhop; for then he is made liable to errour, as all ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Biſhops were, and are; and then in writing of his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, as well as in his teaching he might erre: and hereupon, occaſion is given, to call that part of Canonical Scripture in queſtion; as the aſſerting the Apoſtles to be Biſhops proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, gives the like occaſion to call all their writings in queſtion, which is dangerous, and no wayes to be admitted of. And hence it will follow, in what ſenſe ſoever you call <hi>Mark</hi> an Evangeliſt, yet he could not be a Biſhop properly, although it ſhould be granted, he had an inſpection under the Apoſtles, of all thoſe parts you mention.</p>

And thus <hi>Calvin</hi> ſhewes, what
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:119100:156"/>
was the reaſon of the firſt inſtitution of <hi>Biſhops, Archbiſhops,</hi> and <hi>Patriarchs;</hi> but from that account given by him of this their firſt appointment, it is manifeſt, that their ſuperiority above their fellow Brethren, was not from the beginning, it being but an humane conſtitution only; and that at the firſt, yea even in the time of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, it was nothing like to what it grew to be afterward; And that that power, even of the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> and <hi>Metropolitans,</hi> that was appointed or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, was nothing like unto that power, that was exerciſed by the Biſhops and <hi>Archbiſhops</hi> in this Land, whileſt Epiſcopacy ſtood; their power at that time being chiefly, if not only, for the calling of Synods, <hi>ſc.</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinciall, or of a larger circuit, as there might be need; and they having therein only a preſidency, or moderatorſhip, and not exerciſing any dominion over their Colleagues, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that repreſentation of the matter of fact, that <hi>Calvin</hi> truely makes. And becauſe the appointment of them was done out of a good intent, without any will or purpoſe, to appoint any forme of Government in the Church, differing, from that, which God had appointed in his word; and as an Eccleſiaſtical conſtitution only, which the godly Fathers in thoſe times thought might be of uſe, (though afterward, as we have before ſhewed, it proved otherwiſe) and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring what a good meaſure of the ancient diſcipline, remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed entire in thoſe times, <hi>Calvin</hi> did therefore ſpeak moderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of what they did, though he did not (as is manifeſt) ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of all they did.

                     <p>Now here we might have reaſonably expected, that you ſhould have urged ſome arguments, to have proved, that ruling Elders are not meant in theſe Texts, conſidering what <hi>more large ſatiſfaction</hi> you promiſed in your ſecond Paper afterward, if what was comprehended therein was not judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſatisfactory. But we find that (notwiſtanding your large promiſes and confident and high undertakings) you diſcover barrenneſs in arguing, though what is wanting in reaſons, you make out in foul language; yet we ſhall conſider the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt that you ſay. Firſt in anſwer to theſe Texts you ſay, <hi>they are too generall to prove a ruling Presbytery out of;</hi> But this you ſhould have made good, and not magiſterially have aſſerted it, as you do, without all proof. But you think it is enough that <hi>we have been often told ſo, by many more learned Doctors of our Church.</hi> And we muſt tell you (who it ſeems reckon your ſelves in the number of theſe learned Doctors) that it is a greater part of learning, to prove theſe Texts to be too general to prove a ruling Presbytery out of, then only to ſay ſo much; as by that account which we have given you, in our ſecond Paper, we have there ſhewed, that both the <hi>Provincial Aſſembly of London, in their vindication of the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian Government, and the London Miniſters, in their Jus divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num regiminis Eccleſiaſtici,</hi> do more then ſay, that theſe Texts do hold forth ſuch an Officer in the Church, as the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

But though you urge no argument to convince us of ſo great a fault, yet you can readily enough accuſe us of <hi>wreſting the Scriptures with expoſitions and gloſſes, to make them ſpeak what they never meant;</hi> and which you think is ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made forth by telling us, <hi>that we put ſuch ſtrange ſenſes to places of Scripture, as the Church of Chriſt never heard of till of late yeares;</hi> as if nothing were to be received, that is contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Scripture, as the true ſenſe and meaning thereof, but what can be confirmed to be ſo, by the teſtimony of Fathers and Councils; or as if all the expoſitions that had been given of theſe and other Texts of Scripture, by the Church of Chriſt till of late yeares, were now to be made evident from the writings of the Fathers, that are extant, ſhewing what the expoſitions given by the Church were; or as if the expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of reverend and learned Synods and Aſſemblies of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, of our own or other reformed Churches (having had the help of all the labours of thoſe, that had been in the Church of Chriſt before them) backed with the evidence of Scripture reaſon, and the circumſtances of the Texts, were all to be ſleighted, and to be had in no account, both by us and you, who yet profeſs (though in your practice you ſhew but little of it) to reverence Synods, and to be ready to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to their determination, although we have alſo told you in our anſwer to your ſecond Paper, that (however it being

no controverſie in the pureſt Primitive times of the Church, whether ruling Elders were underſtood in thoſe Texts, nor this caſe brought before the Synods of thoſe times, that ever we have read of; and ſo not that occaſion given to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to diſcuſs this matter upon their expoſitions of thoſe Texts) we are not wholly deſtitute of the teſtimony of the Fathers, for the being of ſuch an Officer, as the ruling Elder in the Church; and do herein referre you and the Reader, to what we have ſaid to this purpoſe, in our anſwer to your ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Paper. But yet for all this, we muſt with you be eſteemed wreſters of the Scriptures; and to brand us the more, you apply unto us (yea to all Presbyters) what Dr. <hi>Andrews</hi> taxed the Papiſts withall, whereby you ſhew the eſteem we are in with you, in that you herein parallel us with the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Cardinals;</hi> which is alſo the charity you have towards us, who in your ſecond Paper, whileſt you had hopes by courting us, to have brought us on to a compliance with you, were your <hi>dear friends</hi> (nay more) <hi>brethren, dearly beloved to you in the Lord;</hi> and this alſo is that more large ſatisfaction that you now give us, in performance of your promiſe there made, if what was comprehended in that Paper, was not ſufficient.

                  <p>The Civil Sword doth and can reach others, your Eccleſiaſtical cannot: The Act inflicts a civill puniſhment, whether corporall or pecuniarie, upon all lawleſs perſons, whether ſuch as contemn Gods Laws or Mans, and not a ſpirituall, and therefore not cenſurable by you. And this is a miſtake of yours to think, that notwithſtanding the puniſhment inflicted upon the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by the civill Magiſtrate, you may for the ſame offence proceed to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute Church-cenſures alſo; ſo a man may come to be puniſhed twice for one offence, which is againſt the Law; and therefore in ſuch Statutes (as in <note place="margin">Cl. cop. <hi>cap:</hi> 2.</note> 1 <hi>Mar. cap.</hi> 3. and 1 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 12.) where there is a puniſhment preſcribed to be inflicted by the Civill Magiſtrate upon the tranſgreſſors of that Act, and alſo another to be inflicted by the Church; yet there is a ſpeciall Proviſo immediately follows, That whatſoever perſon offending the premiſes, ſhall for any the offences afore-recited, receive puniſhment of the Ordinarie, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving teſtimoniall thereof under the ſaid Ordinaries Seal, ſhall not for the ſame offence eftſoon be convicted before the Juſtice, nor in likewiſe receiving for the ſaid offence, puniſhment by the Juſtice he ſhall not receive for the ſaid offence puniſhment of the Ordinary.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. IF we went on to maintain our power of cenſuring the ſcandalous, according to what (as we told you) both God and the civil Authority had entruſted us with, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned you the more to have made good what you undertook. But herein you have fallen ſhort, as we have ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, by what we have ſaid in anſwer to the fourth Section of this Paper, whereby alſo we doubt not, but it will appear, that we are backt by the Authority of the civil Magiſtrate, and that this Authority is not taken off by any ſubſequent Acts of Parliament, that you have inſtanced in; and that therefore our Church Government and cenſures are ſtill of force, and that it doth not depend on the voluntarineſs of the members of our ſeverall Congregations being ſubject thereunto, but upon the Parliaments appointing them to this ſubjection, that any perſons within the bounds of this Aſſociation are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to this Government.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. We do readily grant the Civil Sword, doth and can reach, as thoſe offendors againſt the Laws of the Lands, that ſubmit to the Churches cenſures; ſo alſo thoſe, that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to be ſubject thereunto. But your Argument is very inconſequent, when you would inferre, that the Act or Acts of Parliament inflict a civil puniſhment, whether corporall or pecuniary, upon all lawleſs perſons, whether ſuch as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn Gods Laws or mans, and not a ſpirituall, therefore ſuch offenders are not cenſurable by us. For except there had been ſome late Act, that had repealed the Ordinance of 1648, for Church Government, that appoints the inflicting of ſpirituall cenſures; ſuch offendors, as are juſtly cenſurable by that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, are ſtill cenſurable by us. Neither do we yet ſee, how it is our miſtake, to think, that, notwithſtanding the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment inflicted upon the offendor by the Civil Magiſtrate, we may, for the ſame offence, proceed, to execute Church cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures alſo: or that it is either ſound Divinity, or good Law, that a man may not be puniſhed twice for one offence; which
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:119100:160"/>
yet is the argument whereby you would prove us therein for to miſtake. Indeed we hold it not juſt, that one and the ſame perſon, ſhould be puniſhed twice for one and the ſame offence, with one and the ſame kinde of puniſhment; but that ſuch offendors, as are puniſhable by the civil Magiſtrate with civil puniſhments, may be proceeded againſt by the Church with Church cenſures, is manifeſt, 1. From your <note place="margin">Civil penalties do not free from Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</note> own conceſſions. You had granted in your firſt Paper, that ſuch as are ſcandalous and wicked in their lives, were to be admoniſhed, both publikely and privately; and that if not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, they continue ſtill in their ſcandalous courſes, and would not reform, the Churches lawfull Paſtors had power to excommunicate ſuch. And in your ſecond Paper, it was one of the Arguments you urged to bring us to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with your Propoſals there, that, <hi>by that means the lives and manners of diſsolute perſons, might with brotherly admonition and exhortation be reclaimed, or by due cenſures be corrected and amended.</hi> But now you <hi>eat your own words,</hi> and flatly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict what there you had granted: for now you ſay, ſuch of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendors as are puniſhable by the civil Magiſttate, according to the Acts, that inflict civil puniſhment, are not cenſurable at all by the Churches lawfull Paſtors; nor by us, ſince we have refuſed to comply with your Propoſals; for then a man may come to be puniſhed twice for one offence. 2. From the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and equity that is in ſo doing, conſidering the different nature of Civil puniſhments, and Eccleſiaſticall cenſures; the one being only corporall, or reſpecting the outward man, the other being ſpirituall and reſpecting the ſoul. And therefore ſeeing men conſiſt not only of bodies, but have ſouls alſo; ſuch as are offenders againſt the Laws both of God and men, may and ought to be puniſhed, as with civil puniſhment, appointed by the civl Magiſtrate, to be inflicted on the outward man; ſo alſo with Eccleſiaſticall cenſures, appointed by Jeſus Chriſt, to be inflicted on the ſoul, in caſe of impenitency. 3. This alſo further appears, by the neceſſity and uſefullneſs that there may be of this double puniſhment. The Magiſtrate may have puniſhed the offendor in his purſe or body, and yet he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in an inſenſible and impenitent ſtate, in which reſpect
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:119100:160"/>
there may be a neceſſity, why he ſhould be <hi>noted</hi> with the cenſure of Excommunication, that he might be aſhamed, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3. 14. be delivered unto Satan for the deſtruction of the fleſh, that the ſpirit may be ſaved in the day of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 5. The Magiſtrate alſo may have puniſhed him to the ſatisfaction of the Law, and yet the Church remain unſatisfied, and there be danger alſo of leavening others by his unreformedneſs, except this old leaven be purged out, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 6. Civil puniſhments are neceſſary to be inflicted, for the reſtraining from publike diſorders, not fit to be tolerated in a Chriſtian ſtate: But if there be not repentance for ſuch offences, the ſouls of ſuch offenders, notwithſtanding the Law be ſatisfied, may be damned for their impeniteney; for the preventing whereof Church cenſures are neceſſary and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. Both Magiſtracy and Miniſtry are Ordinances of God, the power of both are neceſſary and uſefull, a bleſſing from God may be expected on the due puniſhment and cenſures that are inflicted by both. And therefore the aſſerting of the one doth not take away or deſtroy the other. But if your do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine be good; if there be an appointment of civil puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to be inflicted by the civil Magiſtrate, and the civil Magiſtrate proceed to do his duty, all the power of the Church is vacated, neither muſt ſhe inflict any cenſures or ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall puniſhments, that ſhe is intruſted with the diſpenſing of, though ſhe ſee her members to be incorrigible, impenitent and in danger to periſh (if her phyſick, that is for the ſoul, be not applied, after the civil Magiſtrate hath gone as farre as he can) becauſe then one and the ſame perſon ſhould be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed twice for one offence; which you ſay, is againſt Law, but we are ſure, is againſt the rules of ſound and good Divinity.</p>

However, the proviſions mentioned in theſe Acts, refering only to the particular caſes mentioned in them, your proof from them falls ſhort, to make out your aſſertion, that is generall, that it is againſt Law for a man to be puniſhed twice for one offence. 2. But yet we further an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that when the Parliament paſſed the Ordinance of 1648, whereby the offendors there mentioned, are made cenſurable

by us with the Church cenſures, as there may be occaſion, according to the rules layd down in the form of Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, there were ſundry penall Statutes in force, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting civil puniſhments on ſeverall of the offendors, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in that Ordinance, and yet there is no proviſo in this Ordinance (that was paſſed after thoſe Statutes) to the purpoſe you ſpeak of, and reſtraining the Church from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting Church cenſures, in caſe the civil Magiſtrate had pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed them by civil puniſhments; but it gives the Church full liberty to proceed, without the leaſt hint of any ſuch a limitation. 3.

Our firſt Quaerie is, <hi>Why Government in ſingulari?</hi> Your anſwer is, <hi>Becauſe it is the onely Government that is eſtabliſhed in this Church by Civill Authority.</hi> This Anſwer hath been confuted before, we ſhall ſay no more here to that. But we are unſatisfied, what you mean by (this Church) whether you mean this Church at <hi>Maneheſter,</hi> where your Claſſis is; or you mean the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> If you mean this Church of <hi>Mancheſter</hi> of your aſſociation, it is eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſht not ſo much by Ordinance of Lords and Commons in Parliament, as by later Acts, grauting the free exerciſe of Religion in Doctrine and Worſhip to all Churches and Congregations in their own way, to all, and all alike, but ſuch as are particularly cautioned againſt. And ſo you in your Presbytery in your Church at <hi>Mancheſter</hi> are protected, becauſe you have poſſeſſed your ſelves of that Church. But then others in other Churches and Congregations, to wit, <hi>Preſtwich, Burie, Middleton,</hi> and the like, may ſay of their way of worſhip, it is the onely Government which is eſtabliſht in this Church. But if your meaning be of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> (and ſo we conceive by the
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:119100:162"/>
ſubſequent words, <hi>viz.</hi> That there is no other Government but yours own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the Church Government throughout the whole Nation) You are certainly miſtaken, and dare not maintain it, that his Highneſs, or his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil owns Presbytery, and none but that Government.</p>
                  <p>But leaving the Civill Sanction, you come to the divine right of Presbytery, and prove it to be the onely Government in <hi>ſingulari;</hi> becauſe it is that onely Government which Chriſt hath preſcribed in his word; and what Chriſt hath thus preſcribed, muſt needs be <hi>de jure,</hi> one and the ſame in every Church. And <hi>Calvins</hi> judgement (you ſay) in this particular is ſo manifeſt by his works, to the whole world, that it needs no proof. We have told you before of the form and order of Church Government appointed by the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> by Patriarch, Arch-Biſhop, Biſhop, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> How this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment (which we ſuppoſe you will not ſay is <hi>Presbyterian)</hi> is in <hi>Calvins</hi> judgement, not differing from that which Chriſt hath preſcribed in his word. And in his firſt Section of this Chapter, he tells us of Biſhops, (not one word of Elders, choſen out of the people who ſhould rule in the Church) but Biſhops that did all, <hi>viz.</hi> make and publiſh Canons (a note certainly of rule and juriſdiction in the Church) in which (ſaith he) they ſo ordered all things after the rule of Gods word, that a man may ſee they had in a manner nothing differing from the word of God. And this form of Government did repreſent a certain Image of divine Inſtitution. Can <hi>Calvin</hi> ſay more for your <hi>Presbytery?</hi> nay, can he ſay ſo much? then how manifeſt is his judgement for the <hi>jus divinum</hi> of your <hi>Presbytery,</hi> that it is that Government in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, which Chriſt hath preſcribed in his word?</p>
                  <p>Thus have we taken off your <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> (as above) your modern Doctors, for Fathers you have none; and now you deſcend to the Aſſembly of Divines.

                  <p>As for ſuch as are lawleſs perſons, and who thoſe be, whether drunkards, ſwearers, unclean perſons, prophaners of the Sabbath, ſuch as will not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject themſelves to the preſent Government, &amp;c. all together or a part, <hi>conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctim ſeu diviſim,</hi> whether you will, they are onely puniſhable by the Civil Magiſtrate, you cannot exclude them the Church by any of your cenſures, as we have ſaid before.</p>

WE did indeed proceed to make anſwer to your ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Queries, and deſire the Reader to peruſe the Queries, you propounded to us in your firſt Paper, and the anſwer we gave unto them, and then to judge how ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactorily
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:119100:163"/>
we did it, after he had fully weighed our anſwer, and what you have ſaid to take off the eſtabliſhing of our Government by the civil Sanction. But whereas your firſt <hi>Query</hi> was, <hi>why Government in ſingulari?</hi> and our anſwer given thereunto was, <hi>becauſe it is the only Government, that is eſtabliſhed in this Church by civil Authority;</hi> you ſay this anſwer hath been confuted before; but how ſtrongly, we ſhall leave it to the Reader for to judge. But it ſeems, this anſwer hath raiſed another ſcruple in your mindes; for you are unſatisfied, what <hi>we mean by this Church;</hi> although in our anſwer we had ſufficiently explained it, it being that Church, wherein the Prelatical Government formerly had been ſet up, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, that being put down, the Presbyterian was ſet up, in its ſtead, as the only Government that was owned, as the Church Government for the whole Nation, as we had told you; and which words did ſufficiently declare, that by (this Church) we meant the <hi>Church of England.</hi> This you confeſs is that which you conceive to be our meaning; yet you quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell at the word, that ſo upon ſuppoſal, that the Church of <hi>Mancheſter, of our Aſſociation,</hi> and where our Claſſis meets, might thereby be underſtood, you might take y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> liberty to tell us, that <hi>our Church Government is not ſo much eſtabliſhed by the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of the Lords and Commons in Parliament, as by later Acts, (granting</hi> (as you ſay) <hi>the free exerciſe of Religion in doctrine and worſhip to all Churches &amp; Congregations in their own way) to all, and all alike;</hi> though you might have obſerved, that the way of Prelacy was ever in the number of thoſe wayes particularly cautioned againſt; and that thoſe of the Presbyterian way have that prerogative, above all thoſe of other wayes, to whom any indulgence is granted; that their way of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is owned and eſtabliſhed by the Parliament, as the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Nation, which is not to be ſaid for any of the other. And therefore neither the Church at <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> nor our Claſſical Presbytery meeting there, are <hi>protected</hi> meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the account <hi>of poſſeſſion of that place,</hi> as you imagine, but becauſe being awarranted thereunto by Authority of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, they ſet up that Government, which the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment appointed and eſtabliſhed as the Government of the
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:119100:163"/>
Nation; and who alſo in their approval of the diviſion of this County into nine Claſſical Presbyteryes, appointed <hi>Preſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich</hi> (wherein the Government was ſet up and exerciſed for along while, although ſince Mr. <hi>Allen</hi>'s return thither, the Elderſhip of that Congregation could do little) to be within the bounds of this Claſſical Aſſociation; <hi>and Middleton and Burie</hi> (in the latter of which Congregations, the Presbyterian Government according to Ordinance of Parliament was alſo ſet up, though the preſent Miniſter joyn not in it) are appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be within the bounds of the ſecond Claſs. And ſo theſe Congregations, that you would ſuggeſt, have a liberty for ſome way of worſhip and different Government from the Presbyterian, granted unto them and exerciſed by them, (though they are not any of them under any character of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence granted to others other wayes) are all of them under the power of the Provincial Aſſembly of this County, and one of them under the power of this; and two of them under the power of the neighbour Claſſical Aſſociation. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon we are certain, we <hi>are not miſtaken,</hi> when we ſay, that <hi>there is no other Government but the Presbyterian,</hi> that was owned by the Parliament, they eſtabliſhing <hi>this Government only, as the Government of the Nation;</hi> and which we do not ſee, but is alſo acknowledged by the humble Advice, aſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto by his Late Highneſs, as we have ſaid before.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But now (you ſay) <hi>leaving the civil Sanction, we come to the divine right of Pres ytery, and prove it to be the only Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in ſingulari, becauſe it is that only Government, which Chriſt hath preſer bed in his Word.</hi> But here we have cauſe to complain, you do us manifeſt wrong, in that you would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent us either abſurdly proving <hi>idem per idem,</hi> or that Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery is of divine right, becauſe it is ſo; or to argue very weakly in ſaying it is of divine right, becauſe it is preſcribed by Chriſt in his Word, and ſo leave the matter without any further proof, nothing whereof at all, is any where to be found in our anſwer; only we find the ſame in that chime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical fancy, which you had firſt conceivd your ſelves, and then were pleaſed to impute unto us. Then you adde, <hi>and what Chriſt hath thus preſcribed, muſt needs be de jure, one and the
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:119100:164"/>
ſame in every Church,</hi> which words did not here follow, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you render, what we had plainly expreſſed, not intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to what purpoſe it was uttered. But becauſe we deſire the matter might be judged of, neither according to your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of it, or what we ſay of it, we ſhall give the Reader a full account, of all that was here expreſſed by us, and which he will find upon the peruſal of our anſwer, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he will perceive, that we were not at all reaſoning (as you repreſent us) but only declaring our judgement, and that in plain expreſſions, without any ambiguity. Our words ſpeaking of the Presbyterian Government were theſe. <hi>And as it is that which we judge to be moſt agreeable to the will of God, ſo alſo we conceive, that whatever is of Chriſts preſcribing in any other different Government (whether Epiſeopal or Congregational) is to be found here, as we do apprehend the redundancies of them both, to be taken away in this, and the defects of them both to be bere ſupplied; and however there may be differences amongst godly ment, concerning Church Government, which it is in particular, that Chriſt hath preſcribed in his Word, yet we judg that the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which Chriſt hath preſcribed in his Word is but one, as all thoſe muſt ſay ſo too, that not being Eraſtians, do bold that one Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment or other is of divine right.</hi> The Reader will hereby perceive, that we did without any manner of reaſoning at all, only declare our judgements; but you repreſent us as argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and that abſurdly; and then you mangle our words, breaking them off, from what they had immediate and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary dependance on, and reference to; for having thus farre declared our ſelves, we came to anſwer to what you had urged in your firſt Paper, out of <hi>Calvin,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Scimus<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>enim unicuique Eccleſiae,</hi> &amp;c. to which we ſaid, the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantials of Government (of which we told you, we did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, if you had quoted the place, where <hi>Calvin</hi> uſed thoſe words, it would appear he ſpeakes) being variable, and ſo but the accidentals of Government, may not be one and the ſame in all Churches. And then we added the words, you in part mention; <hi>but if Chriſt have preſcribed a Government in his Word, for the ſubſtantials of it, it muſt be de jure, one and the ſame in every Church.</hi> And then further ſaid; <hi>and that the
<pb n="992" facs="tcp:119100:164"/>
Presbyterian Government is that in particular, which is there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, in</hi> Calvin'<hi>s judgement, is ſo manifeſt by his workes, to the whole Chriſtian world, that it needs no proof.</hi> Whereby it is very manifeſt to any ordinary underſtanding, that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions we here uſe (and which you mention) have reference to what you had cited out of <hi>Calvin,</hi> in your firſt Paper, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that however he might ſay, that every Church might have their different formes of Government, in regard of the circumſtantials of it, yet ſeeing the Government preſcribed by Chriſt in his Word, for the ſubſtantials of it, is but one, and in <hi>Calvin</hi>'s judgement the Presbyterian Government is that Government; when <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith, <hi>Scimus enim unieuique Eccleſiae,</hi> &amp;c. he was to be underſtood, to ſpeak concerning the circumſtantials of Government only, and not of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantials thereof. Hence alſo it is clear, that we were not here neither, arguing for the divine right of Presbytery; but only declaring and proving, how <hi>Calvin</hi> was to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in the expreſſions you quoted. But as we have ſaid, you mangle our words, and break them off from what im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately went before; whereby from your repreſentation, it is not conceivable to what they referred; but then, you joyning them to other words going before, to which they had no reference, repreſent them to have been uſed by us, to have patched up ſuch a poor argument for the <hi>Jus divinum</hi> of the Presbyterian Government, as before hath been declared; but whether this be either ſincere or ingenuous dealing, we leave it to the Reader to judge.</p>

<pb n="301" facs="tcp:119100:165"/>
But you have, notwithſtanding all this, the boldneſs to alleadge <hi>Calvin,</hi> as a Patronizer of Epiſcopal Government, as you did before. And becauſe you come over again with the ſame thing, we ſhall be forced for his vindication, to make ſome repetition of what we have in part already ſaid. That in <hi>Calvin</hi> which you here referre us to, is the place in his Inſtitutions which was before quoted, <hi>ſc. Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. But in the Chapter immediately going before, we have even now ſhewed, that he declares himſelf fully for the Presbyterian Government; but this you wholly conceal, in which you deal not honeſtly with him. Nay in the very firſt words of this Section, which you cite, he tells you, he had been hitherto ſpeaking of that order of governing the Church, as it is delivered to us out of the pure word of God, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Miniſteryes, as they were inſtituted of Chriſt. And then he addes, now that all theſe things might appear more clearly and familiarly, it will be profitable in thoſe things, to take a view of the forme of the ancient Church, which (as he there ſaith) will repreſent unto us, <hi>a certain i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of divine inſtitution;</hi> which are part of the words, that you cite. But hence it is clear, that ſeeing it is <hi>Calvin</hi>'s ſcope in this Chapter, to compare the forme of Government in the ancient Church, with that forme of Government, that he had held forth, in the Chapter going before, from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, he judged (whatever conſtruction you put upon him to the contrary) that that very Government, in the ſubſtance of it (which he had before proved was held forth in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and which, as we have already ſhewed, from what we have cited out of him, out of the third Chapter goin gbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, was the Presbyterian) was to be found in the ancient Church, in the purer times of it.</p>
                     <p>But in the next place he comes to prevent an Objection, in theſe words, <hi>Tametſi enim multos Canones ediderunt illorum temporum Epiſcopi, quibusplus viderentur exprimere, quam ſacris literis expreſſum eſſet, eâ tamen cautione totam ſuam Oeconomiam compoſuerunt ad unicom illom verbi Dei normami, ut facile videas nihil fere hâc parte habuiſſe à verbo Dei alienum.</hi> Hence it is yet further plain, that however he confeſs, that the Biſhops
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:119100:166"/>
of thoſe times did ſeem to expreſs in many of their Canons ſomething more, then was expreſſed in Scripture, yet that he ſaith, they did compoſe their whole Oeconomy unto the only rule of Gods word, that one might eaſily ſee, they had in this particular, nothing almoſt differing from the word; he here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by declares his judgement yet further, that for the ſubſtance, the Government of theſe times was the ſame with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, he had held forth from the Scriptures in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Chapter. But hence it is alſo clear, that (as we obſerved before) he did not approve of every thing in thoſe Canons; as alſo he preſently after confeſſeth, there was ſomething de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient and wanting in them. For however he excuſe them, in regard they endeavoured to keep the inſtitution of God with a ſincere endeavour, yet he acknowledges, that in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing they erred, although he ſaith, not much; as is clear from his own words, which are as followes, <hi>Verumetiam ſi quid poſſet in ipſorum inſtitutis deſiderari, quia tamen ſincero ſtudio conati ſunt Dei inſtitutionem conſervare, &amp; ab ea non multum ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erraverunt, plurimum conducet hic breviter colligere, qualem ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervationem habuerint.</hi> And then he ſhewes, what the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the ancient Church were. Thus we have given a full and particular account of what <hi>Calvin</hi> hath in this Section, and that in the very order which he himſelf obſerves there, which you doing but partially, and catching only at ſome paſſages, that you think makes for your purpoſe, do moſt groſly wrong him, by your miſrepreſentation. And if we ſhould deal by other Authors, even ſuch as are for the Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Government, as you deal by <hi>Calvin,</hi> which of them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, but we might make to appear Patronizers of the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Government? But you will have <hi>Calvin</hi> to ſay, that in the ancient Church, <hi>the Biſhops did all,</hi> viz. <hi>make and publiſh Canons, a note certainly of rule and juriſdiction in the Church.</hi> Thus you repreſent him, to hold forth the Biſhops exerciſing ſolitary power of juriſdiction in thoſe times, which as it is in it ſelf as contrary to truth, as light is to darkeneſs, ſo it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly contrary to what <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith in the very next Section to that which you cite. For in the former Section he ſaith, that they to whom the Office of preaching was enjoyned,
<pb facs="tcp:119100:166"/>
(ſpeaking ſtill of the ancient Church) they called all thoſe Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters. Theſe (ſaith he) did in every City chcoſe out one out of their own number, to whom they gave more ſpecially the title of Biſhop, leſt diſſentions ſhould ariſe from equality, as oft it comes to paſs. But yet he preſently adds, and ſaith, <hi>Neque tamen honore &amp; dignitate ſuperior er at Epiſcopus, ut domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium in Collegas haberet; ſed quas partes habet Conſul in Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu, ut referret de negotijs, ſententtias roget; conſulendo, monendo, hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tando, alijs praeeat, authoritate ſuâ totam actionem regat, &amp; quod de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretum communi conſilio fuerit, exequatur: id muneris ſuſtinebat Epiſcopus in Presbyterorum caetu; atque id ipſum pro temporum neceſſitate fuiſſe humano conſenſu inductum fatentur ipſi veteres.</hi> And then he quotes <hi>Hierome,</hi> aſſerting a Biſhop and a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be all one. We wonder very much, where your modeſty and ingenuity, nay common honeſty was, when (being you could not but take notice of theſe things in <hi>Calvin</hi> in this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Section, elſe you read him very negligently) yet you ſay, as you here do, that according to <hi>Calvin</hi>'s repreſentation of the Government of the ancient Church, <hi>the Biſhops did all; make and publiſh Canons, a note certainly of rule and juriſdiction in the Church.</hi> Whereas you ſee <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith; the Biſhop had no dominion over the reſt of the Presbyters, whom he here calls his Colleagues; that he had but only that Office, which the Conſul had in the Senate, and is no more then what the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derators have in our Aſſemblies, as is clear from what he here particularly recites, and further ſhews, that he was only to execute what was decreed by common counſell: and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaith, that even this that did belong unto him, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients themſelves confeſs was introduced by humane conſent, and that in regard of the neceſſity of the times. And as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what was appointed by the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> touching <hi>Archbiſhops</hi> and <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> and whereof he makes mention in Section fourth, we have told you before, what you may find in <hi>Calvin</hi> himſelf in that place, where he ſaith, they were <hi>rariſſimi uſus,</hi> of very ſeldome uſe, and that their uſe was chiefly for the aſſembling of Synods. But thus we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve all men will ſee, that <hi>Calvin</hi> is ſo expreſs and full for the Presbyterian Government, and no patronizer of the Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:119100:167"/>
that they will conclude, ſuch as repreſent him other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, are either very weak, or make little conſcience of falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the Authors which they cite; and that you have taken off our <hi>Calvin</hi> no otherwiſe, then by miſinterpreting and groſly wronging him, as after the ſame manner you took off <hi>Beza</hi> before; and both whom, however you in ſcorn call Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Doctors, yet are ſuch Doctors as both you and we may learn much from.</p>
                     <p n="4">4.

But as touching our modern Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, the Aſſembly of Divines, the <hi>London</hi> Miniſters in their <hi>Jus divinum,</hi> the Provinciall Synod of <hi>London</hi> in their Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> and Mr. <hi>Gillespie,</hi> however you deſpiſe them again, as before, as being but <hi>of yeſterday;</hi> yet they are ſuch, who as in regard of their known and approved piety and learning, as they are deſervedly in high eſteem in the Church, ſo they are ſuch as we reverence, and are not aſhamed to cite, though this you count but <hi>a painting</hi> of our margent with them; and further ſay of them, <hi>they may ſerve our turn amongst the ignorant and vulgar ſort, who meaſure all by tale and not by weight:</hi> whereby you pour forth ſuch ſcorn and contempt upon ſo many reverend and glorious lights, as we beleeve all moderate ſpirited men, though in their judgments for the cauſe which you profeſs <hi>to love,</hi> will be aſhamed of, and will diſown in you.

But whether none elſe but you were accounted Saints, none Bretheren and Siſters in Chriſt, but ſuch as ſtand for your pretended diſcipline?

Thoſe that are out, ſay, they were never of you, never had ſworn obedience to, or ſubſcribed any Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of yours, as you or many of you had ſworn Canonicall obedience to the Government by Biſhops, and ſubſcribed the 39 Articles of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> Here is a rent indeed, a Schiſm in the higheſt, which is not ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, but with the utter overthrow of that Church, from whom they rent and raſing out thoſe Articles of Religion, they had formerly confirmed by their own ſubſcription, ſaying, <hi>Illa non eſt, &amp;c.

how ſhould we be conceived, to have denied ſuch aſſemblies in our Land, that are parts of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and of the ſame conſtitution with her, for the ſubſtance, not to be the aſſemblies of the Saints, if they ſtand not for our Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline?

                        <hi>within this Land, that make a profeſsion of the true Chriſtian
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:119100:170"/>
and Apoſtolike faith, are true Churches of Jeſus Chriſt: that the ſeverall members of theſe Congregations are by their birth members, as thoſe that were born in the Jewiſh Church are ſaid to be by the Apoſtle, Jews by nature,</hi> Gal. 2. <hi>that this their memberſhip was ſealed to them in their baptiſme, that did ſolemnly admit them, as into the univerſall Church, ſo into the particular wherein they were born.</hi> But as in this Paper, where you ſhould have replied to theſe propoſitions, if you approved not of them, you anſwered nothing to them: though in your firſt Paper you would have exempted your ſelves from being ſubject to our Government, becauſe you had not admitted your ſelves members of ſome one or other of our Congregations, or were any aſſociates of ours, as you there expreſſed your ſelves; ſo here you come over again with the ſame unſound principle, and yet ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to make it out: intimating, that none are to be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to have rent themſelves from us, but ſuch as have admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themſelves members, or profeſſed themſelves of our aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation: whereas if being members by their birth of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> they after rend themſelves from any of our aſſemblies, or others that are parts and members of it, and of the ſame conſtitution with it, they are guilty of ſchiſme; and which you muſt ſay, or whatever you cry out againſt it, you do not upon any ſure principle, oppoſe it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. But this blot of ſchiſme you would faſten upon us how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, though it be neither upon your own principles here laid down, or any other whereby you can prove us guilty. And to make this out you ſay, that, <hi>we or many of us had ſworn Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical obedience to the Government by Biſhops, and ſubſcribed the</hi> 39 <hi>Articles of the Church of England,</hi> and hereupon, becauſe we are not now for Epiſcopacy, you conclude us guilty of a <hi>rent indeed, a ſchiſme in the higheſt.</hi> But herein you were contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted by Mr. <hi>Allen</hi> himſelf, in the preſence of others of you, that ſubſcribed this Paper, in a full Claſs, to which he and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall of you reſorted (which makes us the more to wonder, how he could ſubſcribe this Paper) who looking about him upon the Miniſters that were preſent, ſaid they were free from that, with which we are here charged, there being none there, that had ſworn Canonicall obedience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> although here you
<pb facs="tcp:119100:170"/>
ſay, <hi>we or many of us</hi> did ſo: as hereupon it will follow from your own principle laid down, that we, who according to Mr. <hi>Allens</hi> own confeſſion, never aſſociated with the Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall Hierarchy, or ſwore any obedience to them, are quit from that guilt of ſchiſme, with which you here charge us. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we have already hinted, that you do not argue well againſt thoſe of the ſeparation; to acquit our ſelves and all the Miniſters of this Land, who now diſown Epiſcopacy, to which they formerly ſubmitted, or to which any of them might have ſworne Canonicall obedience, from the guilt of ſchiſme in this reſpect, we referre the Reader to the grounds we have laid down for that purpoſe, in our Anſwer to your ſecond Paper; and which, whoſoever will but impartially conſider, he will finde, that it is not we, but your ſelves that do make the rent; although to heighten the charge againſt us, you here tell us, that our ſchiſme is ſo great, that <hi>it is not ſatisfied but with the overthrow of the Church</hi> (which yet in our Anſwer to your ſecond Paper we have ſufficiently refuted) <hi>and raſing out thoſe Articles of Religion, we had formerly confirmed by our own ſubſcription:</hi> as if it were an Article of the faith of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which all the Miniſters thereof had ſubſcribed, that the Prelaticall Government by Archbiſhops, Biſhops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> muſt ſtand for ever; or if it were at any time ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away by the Parliament, and diſowned by the Miniſters of <hi>England,</hi> they had raſed out thoſe Articles of Religion, that they had once confirmed by their own ſubſcription. But you muſt pardon us, if we be not ſo credulous, as to conclude the ſame with you, who in your great heat for Epiſcopacy do ſo farre overſhoot.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Unto that wherein you were unſatisfied, <hi>ſc.</hi> what we <hi>meant by the word publick,</hi> our anſwer was full and home; but either you minded it not, or though you ſaw your doubt was reſolved, yet being deſirous to quarrell, you would not take any notice of it: for we did not only tell you, that by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Aſſemblies we underſtood the Aſſemblies, where the publick Ordinances were diſpenſed, which we our ſelves did own, and conſtantly frequent; but alſo ſaid expreſly (as is to be ſeen in our anſwer) <hi>that we do not meddle with the cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:119100:171"/>
of thoſe, who, being godly and ſound in the faith, in the main points of Religion, do yet differ from us in judgement in matters of Diſcipline and Government, and have their Aſſemblies for Gods publick worſhip diſtinct from ours; as we are barred from it by the rules of our Government, as we have often ſaid before.</hi> Theſe were the very words of our anſwer, and therefore, but that we ſee you are reſolved to be ſatisfied with nothing, and find fault with that which is expreſſed never ſo plainly, we ſhould have wondred, that you ſhould here have ſaid, that we come not home to your queſtion; whenas it is manifeſt from the words of our anſwer, that though theſe Aſſemblies own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not our Diſcipline, or we their<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>, yet we denyed them not to be the publick Aſſemblies, or the Aſſemblies of the Saints; as we expreſly profeſſed, we never medled with the cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of them, or to take notice of their members (being ſound in the faith and godly) in order unto cenſure, as the forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the publick Aſſemblies of the Saints. But we here told you, <hi>we were heartily ſorry, that you underſtanding our meaning, as was manifeſt from what you after ſaid, ſhould only move this doubt, to give a laſh at our private meetings,</hi> which in our anſwer we juſtified; but notwithſtanding the laſh you gave us, you do neither acknowledge your fault, nor reply one word to what we had ſaid for our own defence.</p>

Whereas we ſaid in our anſwer, that <hi>ſeeing in the Paper which we had publiſhed in our Congregations, we ſaid notice ſhould be taken of all thoſe that ſhould forſake the publick Aſſemblies of the Saints, you might thence have gathered, our purpoſe was to obſerve and cenſure, thoſe that did maintain and hold up p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="313" facs="tcp:119100:171"/>
ſuch,</hi> and cenſure them not; and we are alſo worthy of blame and puniſhment too, as tranſgreſſors of the Laws of the Land, (as you will have us to be here) if we ſhall proceed to cenſure ſuch. And ſo let us neglect our duty or performe it, we are either way (as you will have it) blame worthy. Yes and which were yet the more to be wondered at, were it not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt from what principle it proceeds, you that crie out of ſchiſme and ſeparation, and blame us for our ſilence, <hi>touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either the ſin or puniſhment of thoſe that erre in Doctrinals, or rend themſelves from the Church;</hi> yet here are become advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates to plead the cauſe of thoſe, that cry down our Church, publick Aſſemblies, Miniſters and Ordinances. For you will have theſe to do all this <hi>out of conſcience,</hi> theſe being your own expreſſions and not ours, we declaring our ſelves plainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning thoſe only, that cry down our Churches and publick Aſſemblies, Miniſtery and Ordinances, as meant by thoſe perſons, that we ſaid, held up private meetings in oppofition to publick, and whom we purpoſed to obſerve and cenſure. But theſe you will have alſo to be exempted from being cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured by us; as alſo all thoſe, <hi>who out of a principle of careleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſloth, worldlineſs, or manifeſt prophaneſs, do on the Lords day, either idle out the time, or elſe are worſe employed, when they ſhould be at the publick Aſſemblies,</hi> and whom in our anſwer we ſaid we purpoſed to take notice of, as ſuch as did forſake the publick Aſſemblies of the Saints.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. But ſeeing you have undertaken to plead the cauſe of both theſe ſorts, and will <hi>have us to be ſure miſtaken,</hi> when we ſaid, <hi>we did not tranſgreſs any Laws of the Land, which had made no proviſo to exempt any of theſe from being cenſured by us;</hi> we are willing to examine the utmoſt you have to ſay for them; which is but only this, <hi>that we can no more proceed tocenſure ſuch as forſake the publick Aſſemblies, by vertue of any Ordinance of Parliament, or rule laid down in our forme of Church Government, then they may be puniſhed by an Act of</hi> 1. <hi>Elizabeth, or an Act of</hi> 35. <hi>Elizabeth, or an Act of</hi> 23. <hi>of Elizabeth;</hi> all which, with our Ordinance, (as you ſay) are <hi>repealed by an Act made Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temb.</hi> 37. 1650. The title whereof you give us, as you had done before: By which (you ſay) the former are not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:119100:172"/>
but tell us what is further enacted. But the ſtrength of this allegation hath been tried before, and found to be as weak as water. This Act of 1650. that you inſiſt on, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing only the Statutes or Ordinance, that inflict civil puniſhment, upon thoſe that repair not to their reſpective Pariſh Churches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and meddles not at all, with repealing of the Ordinance, authorizing the cenſuring of offendors with Church cenſures; and which we have in our anſwer to the fourth Section of this Paper ſufficiently demonſtrated. And therefore all that you ſay for thoſe, you here undertook to exempt from being cenſured by us, is but what hath been diſcovered before to have no ſtrength, and ſo therefore is of no force at all; except we muſt believe, that by your repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, and coming over with it again, and paraphraſing upon it, it had gained ſome new ſtrength, that it never had. And ſo all that follows now, to the concluſion of this Section, is of no weight. For we cannot, againſt manifeſt reaſon to the contrary, judge it to be any great <hi>boldneſs</hi> in us to cenſure thoſe, as forſakers of the publick Aſſemblies of the Saints, who falling under the character that we have given of them, are made cenſurable by the Ordinance, eſtabliſhing the form of Church Government. Neither can we hereupon be brought, to fear any danger of running thereby <hi>into a praemu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nire,</hi> which you again mind us of. There are only two things more we deſire might be taken notice of, before we paſs from this Section. 1. That the Act of 1650. which you quote, doth ſo farre diſcountenance thoſe, who out of a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of ſloth, worldlineſs, or prophaneneſs, frequent not the publick Aſſemblies, that it leaves them to be puniſhed with civil puniſhments, as offendors againſt the Law, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding its taking off the civil penalties from ſome, that are mentioned in it, and as is manifeſt from what you recite out of it; and it not ſpeaking one ſyllable, that may carry any ſhew of a repeal of the Ordinance for Church Government, doth both leave theſe, and all other offendors againſt that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, to be cenſured by the cenſures of the Church, as there may be cauſe. 2. That you, having told us, if notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Act, we ſhould proceed to cenſure, and might run
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:119100:172"/>
our ſelves into <hi>a praemunire,</hi> and then imputing to us ſuch a groſs aſſertion, as if we ſhould have ſaid, we were not to be blamed, for any miſtakes that might ariſe <hi>ab ignorantiâ juris,</hi> whether ſimple or affected, do hereby plainly diſcover, you matter not much with what you charge us, ſo you can but render us abſurd enough. For our ſenſe is clear, from the whole tenour of our diſcourſe, where we uſed any ſuch expreſſions, that we ſaid, we were not to be blamed, for any miſtakes in you, that might ariſe, <hi>ab ignorantiâ juris;</hi> whether ſimple or affected we determined not, but left you to examine; and which is ſo plain, that when you your ſelves recite our words in the beginning of the fourth Section of this Paper, you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent that; which doth plainly ſhew, that there you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood us as we have declared, and of which we minded the Reader in our ſecond Animadverſion on that Section. But now we are the perſons that affirm a thing ſo abſurd, as if we were not to be blamed for our ignorance of the Law, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſimple or affected; and then you cry out, <hi>a ſtrange ſaying,</hi> and tell us, <hi>that you have heard it ſaid, that ignorantia facti ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſat,</hi> but <hi>ignorantia juris non excuſat,</hi> &amp;c. But how faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and ſincerely you have herein dealt with us, the Reader may judge, and we wiſh you in the examination of your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences to conſider.</p>

For what though you were perſwaded in your conſciences, touching the lawfullneſs of all the Canons that were made, and all the Ceremonies that were enjoyned by the Biſhops? Yet you might have known, that even the old Ceremonies, the Croſs in Baptiſme, the Surplice, and kneeling at the Lords Supper, were born as a burden by ſundry godly conformable men, Miniſters and private Chriſtians, however they judged they might ſubmit unto them, being otherwiſe not to enjoy their liberty. But as touching the new Ceremonies that vvere impoſed, as bowing at the Altar, and at the name of Jeſus, if you vvere ſo unſenſible that you ſavv no evil in them, yet you could not (one vvould think) be ignorant, that ſome <note n="‖" place="margin">The of Irela Biſhop colne, th of Carli</note> Biſhops, and generally the godly conformable men through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Land, vvere ſo ſtartled at them, that they choſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to run the utmoſt hazards, then to ſwallow down thoſe things: Beſides, the Canon for the taking the Oath to uphold the Government by Archbiſhops, Biſhops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> did

ſo awaken the Miniſters generally throughout the Land (and vve think Mr. <hi>Allen</hi> vvas in the number of ſuch at that time, and are ſorry he ſhould be leſs ſenſible of the burdenſomeneſſe of that Canon now, then he vvas then) that they not only complained of it, but appeared againſt it. And as touching the ſufferings of the old Non-conformiſts, becauſe they could not ſubſcribe, and ſubmit to the old Ceremonies, being for thoſe things ſuſpended, ſilenced, and excommunicated many of them; it ſeemes you never had hearts to pity them; elſe you would have been ſenſible on their behalf, of the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſomeneſſe of the Canons and Ceremonies, that vvere im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on them, during the continuance of Epiſcopacy, vvhich yet vvere never attempted to be proved by any (that vve have ſeen or heard of) to be in themſelves neceſſary, (however the lawfullneſſe of them vvas defended by ſundry) and to vvhich they could not yeeld vvith peace of their conſciences, though others could not. But here vve obſerve, you are guilty of double uncharitableneſſe. Firſt, In that you raſe out of the number of perſons that are truely conſcientious, all thoſe that did ſigh and groan under the burdenſomeneſſe of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, that vvere impoſed in the time of Epiſcopacy, vvhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther new or old.

And by this vve may gather, vvhat might be expected from you, if Epiſcopacy vvere up again, and it vvere in your power to have all on foot, that vvas im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on the Church of God in former times.

                     <p n="4">4. You that here ſpeak of <hi>the number of Canons, already made in our Provinciall Aſſemblies and elſewhere,</hi> in that ſhort ſpace ſince Presbytery hath been ſet up in the room of Epiſcopacy, (though you cannot mention Presbytery, but you muſt give a blow at it, calling it an uſurpation, though yet you have not proved it to be ſo) <hi>and many urged neceſſary de fide,</hi> might have done well to have mentioned particularly what thoſe Canons are, that the Reader might have judged, both of the number
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:119100:174"/>
and burdenſomeneſs of them, if there had been cauſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint in either reſpect. But becauſe this you could not do, you thought to make a ſtrong accuſation, ſome blot, at the leaſt, being likely to adhere by that meanes (as you might think) though you proved nothing. But it is well known whoſe rule it was, <hi>Fortiter calumniare, aliquid adhaerebit.</hi> You ſhould have alſo told the Reader, what thoſe many Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons are, that you here ſpeak of, that have been <hi>urged neceſſary de fide,</hi> we knowing of none that have been ſo urged, that were Canons, only made by our Provincial Aſſembly, and not held forth in the Canon of the ſacred Scripture. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore till you acquaint the Reader particularly, what theſe are, we hope he will number this amongſt the reſt of the ſlanders, that you have raiſed of us in this Paper. He may diſcerne from what we have declared fully to this purpoſe, that, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding our own perſwaſion touching the divine right of the ruling Elders Office, yet we are farre from impoſing the neceſſity of this opinion touching them upon others; and therefore how we ſhould urge any things, <hi>as neceſſary de fide,</hi> that are but Eccleſiaſtical Orders and Conſtitutions, we leave it to the Reader for to judge; who will hence eaſily gather, what likelyneſs there is of any truth in ſuch a charge: whenas he may alſo further obſerve, that we have declared our ſelves concerning theſe, that they are changeable, and in their own nature variable. But yet you ſay, if <hi>you may judge ex pede Hereulem,</hi> (others that had ſpoken of the multiplicity of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons and burdenſome Ceremonies, impoſed in the times of Epiſcopacy, might have better ſaid, if they might have judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>ex ungue Leonem)</hi> by the number of Canons already made in our Provincial Aſſemblies, (you yet particularizing none) ſince Presbytery was ſet up, what they would amount to, had we lived the age of Epiſcopacy, 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For anſwer unto this, we ſhall here only mind you, of what
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:119100:175"/>
you, (who are well acquainted with the Book of Common Prayer) may find therein, after the Preface of it, entreating of Ceremonies, why ſome be aboliſhed, and ſome retained, where you have theſe words.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>Some (ſpeaking of Ceremonies) are put away, becauſe the great exceſs and multitude of them hath ſo encreaſed in theſe latter dayes, that the burden of them was intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, whereof St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his time complained, that they were grown to ſuch a number, that the ſtate of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian people was in worſe caſe concerning that matter, then were the Jewes. And he counſelled that ſuch yoke and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ſhould be taken away, as time would ſerve quietly to do it. But what would St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> have ſaid, if he had ſeen the Ceremonies of late dayes uſed amongſt us? whereunto the multitude uſed in his time, was not to be compared? This our exceſſive multitude of Ceremonies was ſo great, and many of them ſo dark, that they did more confound and darken, then declare and ſet forth Chriſts benefits to us.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>And yet all this that is here ſpoken of, your ſelves will ſay, muſt needs have been during the ſtanding of Epiſcopacy. When you can bring forth ſuch a teſtimony as this, complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing touching the number and burdenſomeneſs of Canons and Ceremonies, whileſt Presbytery hath been on foot any where, by either the friends or enemies to it, (if they will but ſpeak the truth) there may be then ſome reaſon to give credit to what you would here ſuggeſt; but on this we ſhall give you leave to breath. And in the mean ſeaſon we cannot but take notice, that ſuch is the charity that you have towards us, that you compare us with the Papiſts, for the burdenſomeneſſe of Rites and Ceremonies, impoſed by us on the Church (though your firſt Paper wherein you cried out, <hi>Quare oneramini Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus,</hi> referred only to thoſe few orders mentioned in that of ours, that was publiſhed in our Congregations, ſome where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of your ſelves acknowledge there, to be the orders of Chriſt) and <hi>cenſure us as</hi> Dr. <hi>Andrews doth Bellarmine in behalf of our Engliſh Church.

                  <p>And now we are come to our laſt charge (as you call it) which as it is high, ſo (you judg) it hath little reaſon in it for the bearing it up. But how take you it off? Why firſt you obſerve, <hi>That we omit to mention the firſt part of this Order, and unto which that which follows in the two next Orders doth refer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We grant it doth, but we ſay not that onely, but to the latter branch of that Order alſo touching the Catechized Perſons, and therefore we ſay if they refuſe to preſent themſelves before the Elderſhip, by this your Order the Miniſter muſt exhort and admoniſh them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But that is wholly of our adding,</hi> you ſay, and ſay it again, <hi>Is wholly our own, and none of yours.</hi> Why will you thus boldly averr ſo manifeſt an untruth? Is not the Order expreſs, That the Miniſter, when he Catechiſeth the ſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all families, ſhall exhort ſuch perſons in them, as he finds to be of compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent knowledge, and are blameleſs of life; that they preſent themſelves to the Elderſhip, &amp;c? And do not your ſelves confeſſe, that you ſaid the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter was to exhort, and that was all? But we adde, and ſay, He ſhall exhort and admoniſh. How can theſe words then be wholly our own, and none of yours? Becauſe we adde the word <hi>Admoniſh,</hi> therefore muſt the reſt be none of yours, but wholly ours?</p>
                  <p>But oh the learned Criticks of our age! To exhort and to admoniſh, are two different things which we confound together, taking them for one and the ſame, which is in us a radicall, and grand miſtake.</p>
                  <p>What? every admonition a kind of Church cenſure, or in order (as you call it) thereto, no exhortation ſo?

                  <p>Yes, and the Relative <hi>(They)</hi> is as grand a miſtake and errour in us to apply it to the nearer, when as it muſt of neceſſity be referred to the remoter Antecedent; when the ſubject matter ſpoken of doth neceſſarily require it, as <note place="margin">Cl. cop.</note> in this caſe it is clear it <hi>doth</hi>

                  <p>The fourth Order runs thus <hi>(viz.)

return to the Relative <hi>(they)</hi> and to whom it refers in your conſtruction; that is to thoſe that forſake the publick aſſemblies of Saints, and turn their backs on the Sacrament of the Lords Supper in the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Order mentioned, and to the ſcandalous perſons mentioned in the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>; to theſe, and none but theſe, your cenſures extend.

And you tell us this power of judgment and examination, of ſuch as are knowing, and blameleſſe in life, is not to any one Miniſter, but in the Elderſhip, by virtue of this Ordinance, or form of Church Government, which not onely juſtifies (you ſay) all that is practiſed in that caſe by the ſeverall Elderſhips, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſhewes what ground you had for that was mentioned in your Paper, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both what is therin appointed to the Miniſter about Catechiſing families; and alſo concerning the Miniſters exhorting ſuch as in the ſeveral families he ſhould find to be of competent knowledge, and knew to be of blameleſs life, that they ſhould preſent themſelves to the Elderſhip; the triall and judgment in this caſe, not belonging to any one Miniſter alone, but to the Elderſhip.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. WE ſaid your charge was very high; and it is manifeſt from what you concluded with, when in your firſt Paper, you had driven it up to the height, and ſqueezed our words to the drawing of blood, you made your inference from all your ſeverall deſcants, upon that part of our order in our Paper, that there you pitcht on, and ſaid; <hi>So that in brief, all wilfully ignorant</hi> (though we ſpake nothing in our Paper at all of their cenſure) <hi>and ſcandalous are to be excommunicated; and not onely they, but the knowing and blameleſs in life, if they preſent not themſelves to the Elderſhip.</hi> This is that, you would make us to have declared in our Paper, that was publiſhed in our Congregations; which as it is a ſeverity which we ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred, ſo it is that which malice it ſelf cannot charge us with to have practiſed. Though we told you what was exerciſed in this kinde toward ſuch in the times of the Prelates, for whom you have not one word here to ſay, in way of juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of them in that reſpect; and for which we blame you not, as we had reaſon to do before, touching that little ſenſe you expreſſed touching the ſufferings of thoſe, that did ſigh and groane under the burdenſomeneſs of the Biſhops Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. But why do you here go about, to faſten that upon us ſtill, with which you had charged us before, after we had diſſavoured ſuch a ſenſe as you had put upon us, and after we had been at ſome pains, to evidence to you the groſſeneſs of that miſtake, as well as the heavineſs of the charge? Common ingenuity would have prompted you otherwiſe, if that might have taken place. But you thought at the firſt you had ſome great advantage againſt us, when in your firſt Paper you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to have rendred us ſo odious. And notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Anſwer given, you apprehended you could make out your charge, and therefore you were reſolved to adhere unto it, and do the utmoſt you could for that purpoſe. And ſo it ſeems if we have need of it, we muſt not find any mercy at your hands; and ſeeing it is thus we ſhall try what juſtice you
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:119100:177"/>
here diſcover, and what you have to ſay to prove us guilty, or that our Paper held forth any ſuch a matter, as you have ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven tooth and nail to faſten upon it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We ſaid, as your charge was high, ſo it had as little rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in it for the bearing it up: and this we ſay again. But you hereupon demand; but how do we take it off? your ſelves return the anſwer to it, and ſay, <hi>that firſt we obſerve, that you omit to mention the firſt part of this Order, and unto which that which followes in the two next Orders doth referre.</hi> This indeed we ſaid, and with this we begun; but our work here in the firſt place, was chiefly to give an account, how you had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented us, and to note by the way briefly, what was true in it, and what was falſe, and wherein it was defective; and the deficiency which we took notice of, was that which you mention. And this however it tended to take off your charge, (as <hi>ſc.</hi> it ſerved to clear up our meaning) yet we proceeded farther, and gave you our reaſons, why that could not be our ſenſe, which you had put upon our words. We told you, <q>our practice did ſpeak the contrary; that neither from the rules of Grammar, Logick, or common reaſon, ſuch a conſtruction could be put on our words, as you had given; that it was an exhortation only that was to be given to the perſons catechiſed, to preſent themſelves before the Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and no more: not ſo much as an admonition in order to further cenſure, in caſe not hearkned to, and which two we proved unto you were different things: we alſo told you, that that which followes this order which you thus wreſt, is ſo limited, that it could not with any colour be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to thoſe, that being exhorted by the Miniſter to preſent themſelves to the Elderſhip, ſhould ſtill refuſe. For we ſaid, it ſpake expreſly of ſuch, that ſhould neither hearken to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate admonition nor the admonition of the Elderſhip, that their Names ſhould be publiſhed openly in the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and therefore of thoſe onely, who had been appointed to be admoniſhed, according to Chriſts rule, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. in the fourth Order, and which were onely ſuch, as did forſake the publick Aſſemblies, and the ſcandalous, who had been mentioned in the foregoing order. And yet to make the
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:119100:178"/>
matter more plain, we added, that the perſons that were to have their Names publiſhed, and upon obſtinacy to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded againſt unto excommunication, were ſuch as were ſit to be admoniſhed by the Elderſhip, and reject that admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, before they were further to be proceeded againſt; which could not be conceived from any thing in our Paper, to be the caſe of thoſe, who being exhorted by the Miniſter to preſent themſelves to the Elderſhip, refuſed to come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them.</q> Theſe ſeverall reaſons the Reader may finde in the laſt Section of our Anſwer, however not laid down al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together in this very forme and manner, unto which yet you anſwer not, (according to your uſual practice in this Paper, paſſing over the arguments that we urged, and ſaying nothing to them) and hereby it was that we endeavoured chiefly to take off your charge, and thought it was the faireſt way to do it, the rendring you our reaſons to clear it up unto you, what the true ſenſe of our words was, being the moſt rational way we could take therein. We likewiſe, on theſe and other grounds mentioned in our anſwer, proceeded to anſwer the reaſons, that we apprehended might induce you, to put that conſtruction upon our expreſſions which you did, and which the Reader in our anſwer may ſee particularly, and to ſome of which you here ſay ſomething, the ſtrength whereof we ſhall examine anon. And then in the cloſe of all, we ſaid, we had thus farre removed all imaginable grounds in our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, for this your groundleſs charge, that our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe was to excommunicate all knowing and blameleſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, if they preſented not themſelves before the Elderſhip. And then we further added, and ſaid, that we ſhould now proceed to examine what you produced for the ſupporting of your ſelves in it, and which we did accordingly, as the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may obſerve. And thus we endeavoured to take off your charge, and of which we give the Reader an account, that ſo he may diſcern the better how groundleſs it was. But now as to what you here begin with, hence it is clear, that upon what account ſoever it was, that we mentioned your omitting of the firſt part of our Order, unto which we ſaid, that which followed in the two next Orders did referre, it
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:119100:178"/>
was not any fair way in you to do ſo; that your omiſſion, being of what tended to clear up our ſenſe and meaning, which was thereby darkened and obſcured. But this though we had complained of in our anſwer, and that juſtly, yet herein you anſwer nothing for your ſelves, and ſo ſtill remain unacquitted from that blame, we had in this reſpect laid upon you.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And now whereas you grant, that, that which followes in the two next Orders, refers to the former part of the fourth Order, which you omitted, but then ſay, not <hi>to that only, but to the latter branch of that Order alſo, touching the catechiſed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> This is that which we muſt conſtantly deny. And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you aſſert it, yet ſeeing you neither anſwer our reaſons to the contrary, which we gave you, and have here briefly recited, nor bring forth here any thing to make good your aſſertion, you cannot reaſonably expect, that all men will believe, what you affirm in this particular, although you your ſelves, notwithſtanding all that hath been or ſhall be ſaid, ſhould ſtill have ſuch a faith. And therefore it will not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, by that our Order, that if the catechiſed perſons refuſed to preſent themſelves before the Elderſhip, the Miniſter muſt <hi>exhort and admoniſh them in order to the publiſhing of their Names in the Congregation, and excommunication in caſe they ſhould perſiſt in ſuch refuſall,</hi> and which is the ſenſe that you put upon, that which was appointed to be done by the Miniſter toward catechiſed perſons; all that was appointed to be done by the Miniſter, being onely to exhort them, that were found to be competent in knowledg, and blameleſs in life, to preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Elderſhip; without the leaſt hint of any further proceſs that was to be againſt them, in caſe they hearkned not unto that exhortation.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In your firſt Paper (as we have told you) you recited (omitting the former part of our fourth Order) only the latter, and that in theſe words, <hi>viz. That the Miniſter when he catechiſeth the ſeverall families, ſhall exhort ſuch perſons in them, as he findes of competent knowledg, and blameleſs in life, that they preſent themſelves to the Elderſhip, that they may be admitted to the Lords Supper.</hi> Then you come in with your comment upon
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:119100:179"/>
it, and ſay; <hi>But what if they will not preſent themſelves before the Elderſhip? the Miniſter</hi> (ſay you) <hi>muſt exhort and admontſh.</hi> This, we ſaid in our Anſwer, was wholly of your adding, and after we had rendred our reaſons, why that part of our Order could not be underſtood, as you repreſented it in your Paper, and had anſwered all imaginable objections, in our apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: we ſaid this again. And here we deſire it might be took notice of, that we did not only ſay this, but gave our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for it; and muſt, after ſo long time of conſideration, ſay ſo ſtill. But that it might here appear upon what ground we ſaid this, though the Reader might of himſelf find it in our Anſwer, we will recite ſo much out of it, as may make this evident. We coming to examine, what you produced for the ſupporting of your ſelves in what you had charged us with, ſaid; <hi>we found ſomething in your comment upon our words, which was not in our text. For you ſaid, what if after the Miniſter hath exhorted them, they ſhall not preſent themſelves before the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſhip? the Miniſter, ſay you, muſt exhort and admoniſh them. But this</hi> (we ſaid) <hi>as we told you, was wholly your own and none of ours.</hi> And then we added our reaſons, in theſe words;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For firſt, though we do not deny, that if upon the firſt exhortation they do not preſent themſelves to the Elderſhip, it being in order to their regular and orderly admiſſion to the Lords Supper, the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter may exhort, and exhort them again, becauſe they continue in the neglect of that, which is their duty, yet there was no ſuch thing ſaid by us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But then to make the ground of your charge ſomething more co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lourable, you added another word, which was not at all uſed by us. We ſaid the Miniſter was to exhort, and that was all. But you add and ſay, He ſhall exhort and admoniſh. But</hi> (we ſaid) <hi>we had told you before, to exhort and admoniſh were different things.</hi> But here without ever ſo much as attempting to ſay any thing to theſe reaſons, you fall foul upon us and ſay; <hi>why will you thus ſo boldly averre ſo manifeſt an untruth?</hi> But if you had conſidered how many untruths, you had your ſelves boldly aſſerted in this Paper, you would have been more ſparing, then here again thus groundleſly to have charged us with aſſerting of untruth. We do not deny, but the <hi>Order is expreſs</hi> (as you ſay,) That
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:119100:179"/>
the Miniſter, when he catechizeth the ſeverall families, ſhall exhort ſuch perſons in them, as he finds to be of competent knowledg, and are blameleſs in life, to preſent themſelves to the Elderſhip, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as we do alſo grant, as you do alſo here hint, <hi>that we did confeſs that the Miniſter was to exhort, and that was all</hi> (and which is all the reaſon you here bring to make out the charge againſt us <hi>of aſſerting a manifeſt untruth)</hi> But yet we muſt ſtill ſay, that the comment upon our words by you made, both the queſtion moved by you <hi>(ſc. what if after the Miniſter hath exhorted them, they ſhall not preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before the Elderſhip)</hi> and your Anſwer by your ſelves given to it <hi>(ſc. The Miniſter muſt exhort and admoniſh)</hi> is wholly your own and none of ours; both becauſe there was no ſuch a Queſtion moved by us, or any ſuch an Anſwer given to it; and alſo becauſe you adding in your Anſwer made to that Queſtion, the word <hi>[admoniſh]</hi> to the word <hi>[exhort]</hi> ſaying, <hi>He muſt exhort and admoniſh,</hi> did deprave and corrupt the ſenſe of the word <hi>[exhort]</hi> in which it was taken by us; and by that addition made it equivalent to an admonition in order to further cenſure, which was ſpoken of in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the fourth Order; and to which the two following Orders touching publiſhing Names, and excommunication in point of obſtinacie did referre. Theſe reaſons (to which you here make no reply) we gave you in our Anſwer (as by what we have recited out of it the Reader may perceive) whence it is manifeſt, that that comment you made upon our words (however the word <hi>[exhort]</hi> be found therein, which is perverted by you from the ſenſe, in which it was taken by us) is wholly your own and none of ours.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. But upon this you return your wonted flouts, and ſay; <hi>But oh the learned Criticks of our age! to exhort and admoniſh are two different things, which we confound together, taking them for one and the ſame, which is in us a radical and grand miſtake.</hi> Unto which we ſay: You had approved your ſelves to have been the more learned men, if you had replied, to what we had preſented to you in our Anſwer, proving the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt an admonition in order to further cenſure, if not heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to, and an exhortation onely. But according to your
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:119100:180"/>
ordinary practice in matters of this nature, when you ſhould return your anſwer to an argument, you come not to this at all, but paſs it over, putting it off with a ſcoff. And here, that it may appear to the Reader, that we did not without ſome reaſon diſtinguiſh betwixt an admonition in order to further cenſure, and an exhortation onely, and that therefore your ſcoffs are reaſonleſs, we are forced to recite ſomething further out of our Anſwer. Having told you, <hi>That it was an exhortation onely, that was appointed to be given to the perſons cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chized, to preſent themſelves to the Elderſhip, and no more; not ſo much as an admonition in order to any further cenſure, if not hearkned unto:</hi> we added and ſaid. <hi>And here we obſerve, that this is one main ground of your miſtake; that you do not diſtinguiſh betwixt an admonition that is in order to a further cenſure, if it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail not (and which was mentioned in the firſt part of the fourth Order, and which you wholly omit) and an exhortation; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found theſe together taking them for one and the ſame, and which is here a radicall and grand miſtake. For doubtleſs in a thouſand caſes, that might be inſtanced in, there may be place for an exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, when (though ineffectuall) there is not place for an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, that is in order to a further Church cenſure, in caſe of obſtinacy, as it is taken by us here. Men may be exhorted to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine and prove themſelves, whether they he in the faith: to ſelf-examination, before they come to the Lords Table: to grow in grace and in the knowledg of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt: to keep their hearts with all diligence: and to infinite more things of the like nature; and which are duties they ſhould apply themſelves unto, when yet there is no room for an admonition, in order to any Church cenſure, in caſe it be not obeyed. Nay when men may perceive, there is not that care, that ſhould be in perſons, in regard of ſome of their words and carriages, there may be place for an exhortation, and yet for no admonition in order to any Church cenſure, in caſe the exhortation be not hearkned unto: if there be not any further ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous outbreakings of corruption, that may merit it. Church cenſures are not to paſſe upon men for every fault, nor againſt ſuch as be guilty of ſuch ſins of infirmity, as are commonly found in the children of God; as in that caſe by the rule, of our Government it is provided againſt. And yet an exhortation to righteouſneſs and watch full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:119100:180"/>
in ſuch caſes is not uſeleſs. And ſo it may be well appointed by us, that the Miniſter ſhould exhort ſuch, as are found by him to be perſons of knowledg, and are in converſation blameleſs, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent themſelves to the Elderſhip, that ſo they might be regularly and orderly admitted to the Sacrament of the Lords Supper (an Ord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance that is not to be ſleighted, as it is by many, but upon too ſleight grounds, as they will be found to be, when they are to be tried in the day of account) and yet no proceedings by Church cenſures againſt ſuch perſons, in caſe an exhortation prevail not.</hi> Thus far we have recited, what we anſwered; but now what is it, that is replied to all this? not one word, but only a bitter ſcoff, as if that were ſufficient to anſwer every argument. But we beleeve all ſober perſons will ſee, you have not therein very learnedly anſwered us; however ſcornfull men (whoſe cenſures we matter not) may therein applaud you. But yet to clear up the matter further, (however we judg all inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous perſons will be fully ſatisfied with the bare recitall of the Anſwer, that had been given) becauſe we ſee, you have put our words upon the rack and ſtretcht them upon the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, till they have quite loſt their ſenſe, in which we uſed them, and that you are reſolved to deal as ſtrictly with us as you can, where you apprehend you have any advantage. We muſt here open this matter a little more fully. And firſt, We ſhall not deny, that the word <hi>[admoniſh]</hi> is ſometimes ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſo largely, as that it is the ſame with the word <hi>[exhort,]</hi> and ſo ſome of the Texts you urge, may prove, <hi>&amp;c. Acts</hi> 20. 31. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 14. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 16. in which Texts the greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that doth properly ſignifie to admoniſh, is uſed. And yet we ſhall not contend, but the ſenſe of it there may be the ſame with the word, that doth properly ſignifie to exhort: as alſo when the Apoſtle in another of the Texts cited by you, <hi>viz. Titus</hi> 3. 1. ſaith, uſing another word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, put <hi>them in mind,</hi> though it ſhould be rendred <hi>[admone illos,]</hi> that word may imply an exhortation. And again we ſhall as readily grant, that the word <hi>[exhort]</hi> is ſometimes taken ſo largely, as that it may comprehend, under the latitude of it, that, which is uſually underſtood by the word <hi>[admoniſh]</hi> ſtrictly taken, as in <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 8. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

But yet though theſe words are ſometimes uſed thus promiſcuouſly, they are alſo diſtinguiſhed. <hi>To admoniſh</hi> taken ſtrictly and eſpecially in an Ecclaſiaſticall ſenſe, is to reprehend in regard of ſome fault, and ſo it is taken 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 14. <gap reason="foreign">

                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>: and likewiſe from the word <hi>[exhort]</hi> taken ſtrictly, as appears from the ſame <hi>ver.</hi> 14. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> &amp;c. <hi>we exhort you brethren;</hi> and yet doubtleſs the Apoſtle did not by that exhortation ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh thoſe he writes unto, to warne or admoniſh the unru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in that ſenſe, as he would have thoſe unruly ones to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed. But to make the matter more plain, we may here diſtinguiſh concerning admonition. There is <hi>a meer charitative admonition;</hi> and an <hi>admonition in order unto further cenſure</hi> if not hearkned unto. This latter, as we have told you, is not to be given for <hi>ſuch infirmities, as are commonly found in the children of God,</hi> no nor yet for <hi>ſmaller faults or injuries, which Chriſtian prudence, love and peaceableneſs require an overlooking and paſſing by;</hi> and of which <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 15. is not to be underſtood: <hi>but the offence there grounding the admonition is a greater evil, endangering the ſoul of the doer, ſcandalizing the brother ſeeing it, and lying as a ſtumbling ſtone in his Chriſtian courſe; and ſuch a ſin, that for the nature of it, is fit, in caſe of inſucceſſefullneſs of admonition, to be brought before the Church,</hi> as herein our reverend brethren, the aſſociated Miniſters of the <hi>County of Eſſex,</hi> do very well deliver themſelves in their late Agreement, <hi>pag.</hi> 14. <hi>n.</hi> 5. This <hi>admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> that is in order to Church cenſure, is <hi>either</hi> of private mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and which may be alſo called <hi>brotherly</hi> and charitative; or elſe it is <hi>of the Officers</hi> of the Church; and which is either given by any one, or more of the Officers <hi>ſeverally,</hi> which yet in them is <hi>authoritative;</hi> or elſe by them <hi>all joyntly,</hi> and which is the admonition of the Church ſpoken of <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. <hi>ver.</hi> 17. (which is another of the Texts you here mention) although
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:119100:181"/>
it is moſt orderly that this admonition be given by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, (or one of them, where there be two or more) in the name of the reſt of the Church-Officers, that give the offender this admonition. But beſides this admonition, that is in order to Church cenſure, in caſe it prevail not, there <hi>is alſo a meer charitative admonition,</hi> that may be for leſſer faults, that yet are not to be cenſured with Church cenſures in caſe there be not reformation. Although there are to be endeavours to redreſs ſuch offences; and which kind of meer charitative admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may be comprehended under the latitude of that rule laid down <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 1. You your ſelves do not here deny, but there may be a private admonition, that is not in order to Church cenſure, when upon your quoting <hi>Calvins</hi> words on <hi>Titus</hi> 3. 10. you ſay (ſeeming to approve of what you take to be his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, though you miſinterpret him, as we ſhall ſhew anon) <hi>not every private admonition is in order to excommunication in</hi> Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vins <hi>judgement.</hi> And this was neceſſarily implied in the words we uſed in our Anſwer, when we oppoſed an admonition in order to further cenſure unto that, which is but an exhortation only; intimating plainly enough thereby, that there was <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides an admonition in order to further cenſure, a meer charitative admonition,</hi> which was not to be followed with any Church cenſure in caſe it prevailed not. This is that likewiſe, which our forementioned Reverend Brethren of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> in their Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment do alſo ſpeak of, having given their ſenſe upon <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 15. they further ſay in their Agreement <hi>pag.</hi> 15. <hi>n.</hi> 6. <hi>Beſides this Eccleſiaſticall admonition, we yeeld there may be other charitative admonitions, which muſt not preceed to Eccleſiaſticall cenſure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But from all that hath been thus far ſpoken touching ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, its very clear, that admonition taken ſtrictly and properly, is a reprehenſion in regard of ſome evill, or fault done. Though we do not deny, but there may be an admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition by way of caution, warning to take heed of ſome ſin, that one may be in danger to commit. We ſhall now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to ſhew what exhortation is taken in a ſtrict acceptation. To exhort ſtrictly is to excite or perſwade, and ſtir up unto that, which is good, and is diſtinguiſhed from admonition taken properly, as is manifeſt from the Text before quoted,
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:119100:182"/>
1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 14. <hi>Now we exhort you brethren</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>warne them that are unruly,</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> are here exhorted only or ſtird up to perform their duty towards the unruly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and are not at all blamed by the Apoſtle: but the unruly that were to be warned or admoniſhed, were to be reproved and blamed by the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> for their unrulineſs. And there is place fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently for an exhortation, when there is not to be any repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion or admonition given in regard of any thing amiſs. But to make this matter yet more plain, we may here diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of exhortation, as before of admonition. For exhortation alſo is either <hi>charitative</hi> or of private Chriſtians, and of which <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 13. <hi>Exhort one another daily, while it is called to day:</hi> and <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 25. <hi>Not forſaking the aſsembling of your ſelves together, as the manner of ſome is, but exhorting one another,</hi> &amp;c. or <hi>authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> and of the Miniſter; and which may be either publick or private; and of which there is often ſpeech in the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: As 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 1. <hi>I exhort therefore that firſt of all ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations and prayers,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>be made for all men.</hi> 2 Cor. 9. 5. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I thought it neceſſary to exhort the brethren.</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 21. <hi>Theſe things teach and exhort.</hi> So in one of the Texts alleadged by you, <hi>Titus</hi> 2. 15. <hi>Theſe things ſpeak and exhort, and rebuke with all authority.</hi> Where exhortation may well be diſtinguiſhed from rebuke, though both be authoritative, and are to be joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Doctrine, ſuch applications of Doctrine being very uſefull and neceſſary. So 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 1. <hi>The Elders which are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you I exhort, who am alſo an Elder.</hi> By theſe Texts it is clear, that as an exhortation properly is an excitation, or perſwaſion unto ſomething that is good, ſo it is diſtinguiſhed from admonition taken ſtrictly, and which is a reprehenſion for ſomething amiſs; and that in many caſes it may be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, when there is not the leaſt intimation of any neglect or ſin committed, for which the parties ſo exhorted are repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Unto which we may further adde, <hi>Acts</hi> 27. 22. where <hi>Paul</hi> ſaiſh to thoſe in the ſhip with him, <hi>And now I exhort you to be of good chear.</hi> This exhortation was not doubtleſs in order to any Church cenſure, and therefore muſt needs be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from ſuch an admonition. So when it is ſaid of <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas,</hi> that when he had ſeen the grace of God, he was glad, and
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:119100:182"/>
exhorted them all, that with purpoſe of heart they would cleave to the Lord, <hi>Acts</hi> 11. 23. This cannot be with any co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour underſtood of any admonition in order to Church cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: The beſt of men, that walk never ſo blameleſly, may be exhorted, when yet there is no reaſon, why they ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed in order to Church cenſure, except men muſt be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed and cenſured for ſuch common infirmities, from which no men on earth are wholly free.</p>
                  <p>But by this that we have ſaid, it is ſufficiently evidenced, that in Scripture language an exhortation taken ſtrictly and properly, is, notwithſtanding <hi>your ſcoff,</hi> a different thing from an admonition in order to further cenſure, if it prevail not. And we think, however you may account of us, you had ſhewed your ſelves to have been more learned, if you had not ſo cauſeleſly quarrelled with that, which is ſo manifeſt to any, that are verſed either in Scripture, or any other approved Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors. But we ſhall not examin what you oppoſe to what we had herein aſſerted. 1. And firſt you begin with us ſharply, and ſay; <hi>What? every admonition a kind of Church cenſure, or in order (as we call it) thereunt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>t either from Scripture, Fathers,</hi> &amp;c. But here you charge us with what we never ſaid, <hi>&amp;c. That every admonition is a kind of Church cenſure, or in order to it, and no exhortation ſo.</hi> Our diſtinction intimated, that beſides the admonition, that was in order to Church Cenſure, there might be a charitative admonition, as there may be a charitative exhortation, yea an authoritative by the Miniſter, when yet there is no place for cenſure, in caſe the exhortation be ſucceſſeleſs. This we have ſhewed you from Scripture, though you twit us again with being for the <hi>word of God alone,</hi> for which we are not aſhamed to profeſs our ſelves to be. And thus you have very learnedly in the firſt place oppoſed us, by imputing to us, what we never ſaid. 2. But it may be your next is of greater ſtrength; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſhall hearken to what you have to tell us, <hi>ſc. That the words admoniſh and exhort, are promiſcuouſly uſed.</hi> And who ever denied this? Here therefore you have put your ſelves upon the pains to prove what we never gainſayed: nay you prove by

Then you come to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the other part touching the Miniſters exhorting of the Catechized perſons and ſay of this, as if we had therein aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſome abſurd thing. The <hi>Miniſters Exhortation is not ſo much as private Admonition.</hi> But we are not aſhamed of this Aſſertion, it being that we ſtill own. And here it had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come you to have oppoſed it with ſome Arguments; but this (it may be) you thought you had done ſufficiently before, when you had told us, and took the pains to prove that, which we never denied, <hi>viz.</hi> That to admoniſh and exhort <hi>are preſumptuouſly uſed.</hi> But we have proved unto you, that theſe two taken properly are diſtinguiſhed; Admonition properly being a reprehenſion in regard of ſome fault; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as an exhortation is a more gentle way of proceeding, and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the exciting or perſwading unto duty; and for which there may be place as (we have told you) in a thouſand Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:119100:183"/>
where there is not to any admonition in order unto cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in caſe of unſucceſsfullneſs, and in which ſenſe admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is taken here.</p>
                  <p>And now we go on to what follows, Though here we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that you having recited the fourth Order at large, when you ſhould come to recite the fifth, do it not only in part, and therefore that the matter here may be the more clearly underſtood (that though your imperfect recitall of it may be darkned to an undiſcerning Reader) we ſhall mention it ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The Order was thus. <hi>That if they will neither hearken to private adminition, nor the admonition of the Elderſhip, their names ſhall be publiſhed openly in the ſeverall Congregations, and they warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before all to reforme.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Queſtion now is (as you here ſay) to whom this Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive <hi>[they]</hi> refers. It is indeed now a queſtion, becauſe you have made it one; though it was at firſt cleare enough to any ordinary underſtanding, where there was not a ſpirit of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and a deſire to cavill; but if there had been any doubt, yet in our Anſwer we cleared it, by declaring our ſenſe, and giving our reaſons, why our words were to be ſo conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But notwithſtanding we had ſo done, becauſe you are not willing to be ſatisfied, you will have it to be a queſtion ſtill. And ſeeing with you it muſt be ſo, let us ſee, what you can make of it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. You would ſeem to returne what our Anſwer to this queſtion was, but you deface it, and when you have done giving your cenſure of it. But here we deſire the Reader to obſerve. 1. That you would by this anſwer, which you ſay we give, make the perſons diverſe, that are ſpoken of in the latter part of the fourth Order, <hi>(viz.</hi> Such as being found competent in knowledge and blameleſs in life, were to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted by the Miniſter, to preſent themſelves to the Elderſhip in Order to their admiſſion to the Lords Supper) becauſe of the double qualification there mentioned, as requiſite to make them capable of the Ordinance; which is here your firſt errour.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Having diſtinguiſhed the perſons, that we made one, and expreſſed that diſjunctively <hi>(not to the laſt [they]</hi> as you are pleaſed
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:119100:184"/>
to expreſs it, <hi>nor laſt but one; not to the blameleſs in life, or compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in knowledge)</hi> which we expreſſed it copulatively <hi>(ſuch as are of a competent knowledge and blameleſs in life.)</hi> You in the next place tell of Perſons mentioned <hi>in two Orders long before,</hi> to whom (as you would have us to ſay) the Relative <hi>[they]</hi> referres, and <hi>not to the neareſt, or neareſt but one.</hi> Whereas the Perſons, to whom we ſay, this Relative <hi>[they]</hi> in this fifth Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der referres, are thoſe mentioned in the former part of the fourth Order immediately before, <hi>viz. Thoſe who were to be privately admoniſhed according to Chriſts order,</hi> Mat. 18. And who were either the ſcandalous or forſakers of publick Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies; and which though they had been mentioned in the ſecond and third Orders, yet were the ſame perſons, that were ſtill ſpoken of in the beginning of the fourth Order, and to which the Relative <hi>[they]</hi> by us there uſed, did referre Here then is another error. And yet we denied, and do ſtill, that the Relative <hi>[they]</hi> in this fifth Order, did referre to the neareſt Perſons mentioned in the fourth Order. (which yet you will ſtil have in regard of their two-fold qualification to be diverſe Perſons, which errour we noted before) <hi>viz.</hi> the Catechized Perſons, but to the Perſons mentioned in the beginning of the fourth Order only. 3. When you tell of this Relative <hi>[they]</hi> mentioned in that fifth Order, referring <hi>not to the laſt [they] but to two other [they's]</hi> theſe expreſſions being your own and none of ours; you do not herein approve your ſelves to be very good Grammarians; the Relative not referring at any time to another Relative, but to an Antecedent, if men will ſpeake properly; however the Antecedent, to which it refers, may be ſpoken of, and implyed in a Relative going before, and as in this place it is. Here then is your third errour. It is a wonder to thinke that wittie men, and ſuch as had triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over us as poore illiterate Perſons but a little before, ſhould in ſo few words have erred ſo much. And yet we cannot judge, that the Reader will imagine, you have in any of your Papers diſcovered any ſuch depth in other Learning. As that (if you had been ſo wholly taken up therein, that you had thereby forgot your Rudiments) you were to be thereupon excuſed. 4. When we ſaid the Relative <hi>[they]</hi> muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:119100:184"/>
not to the next, but the remoter Antecedent (and which was that only, that was aſſerted by us) we did not <hi>Magiſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi> aſſert this, but gave our reaſons for this Aſſertion; though you indeed <hi>Magiſterially</hi> reject it, not returning any anſwer to the Argument we gave you for that conſtruction given of our words. And therefore your cenſure of us <hi>(Satis haec magiſteraliter)</hi> may well by us be ſleighted, being without all reaſon. 2. We have noted, what we thought ours fit to be obſerved in the anſwer, you would repreſent us to have given to the queſtion; we ſhall now ſee, what it is, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with you oppoſe our Aſſertion.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. And firſt you tell us, <hi>You underſtood</hi> (as you do ſtill) <hi>that the Relative [they] may referre to the remoteſt,</hi> viz. <hi>to thoſe that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the publick Aſſemblies in the ſecond Order, and the ſcanaalous in the third Order mentioned, but not excluding the meaneſt Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</hi> viz. <hi>men of competent knowledge and blameleſs in life</hi> (Here you expreſs your ſelves, as we did, Copulatively, and take theſe perſons for one and the ſame, though conſidered under this two-fold qualification, and to be one Antecedent, which even now you would have had to be two.) <hi>in the fourth Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der mentioned.</hi> Thus you aſſert, <hi>Satis magiſteraliter,</hi> as we may ſay for ſure; for you anſwer not to the rule, we had laid down, <hi>viz.

That the Relative not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly may, but muſt of neceſſity, referre to the remoter Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and not to the next, when the Subject matter requires it, is manifeſt from theſe examples.

This interpretation of this Text, which we have given, is followed by <hi>Junius</hi> in his paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lels, who there laies down this very rule, that we gave in our Anſwer: <hi>Haec autem omnis dubitatio tolli evidentiſſime poteſt, (niſi me animus fallit) unica obſervatione Grammaticâ, quod Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lativum Pronomen, in utro<expan>

<pb n="344" facs="tcp:119100:186"/>
the Families, <hi>and tho rather</hi> (as we had told you in our Anſwer) <hi>becauſe having the opportunity of conference with them at this time, if they had any doubts about this matter, or he ſaw that it was prejudice only in them againſt the Elders, that hindred them</hi> (and as it is in moſt) <hi>he might endeavour to remove them.</hi> With this we judge all ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and impartiall Readers will be ſatisfied, and will not conceive, that the rule, we laid down, touching the Relative <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, being referred to the remoter Antecedent, where the Subject matter required it, was miſapplied by us; there being plaine reaſon from the expreſſions we uſed, why it ought to be thus referred. But you having on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſed our rule by laying down a contrary aſſertion, without any reaſon, do now make your inference, that <hi>then your note of attention</hi> (as you ſay, we called it) <hi>ſtands good.

Relative <hi>[they]</hi> and to whom it refers in our conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that is, to thoſe, that forſake the publick Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of Saints, and turne their backs on the Sacrament of the Lords Supper in the ſecond Order mentioned, and to the ſcandalous perſons mentioned in the third, to theſe and none but theſe <hi>our cenſures extend.</hi> And this we ſay ſtill; neither have you urged any thing, that can have any colour of making good againſt us to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; you having hitherto not argued, but only without reaſon laid down your oppoſite aſſertion, the groundleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe whereof hath been ſufficiently diſcovered by what hath been ſaid.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But perhaps you would be thought to performe this in the next, when you further repreſent us to ſay, that <hi>ſuch as the Miniſter findes knowing and blameleſſe in life, ſhall not be debarred the Sacrament, though they preſent not themſelves to the Elderſhip, and that this we ſay, becauſe ſhame will not ſuffer us to affirme the contrary; and then do aske us, but where's our practice all the while, or how obſerve we the rules, we walke by, laid down, as we had told you, in the forme of Church Government?</hi> But for anſwer here we ſay; 1. That you have loſt your Queſtion, which was not, whether ſuch as the Miniſter finds knowing and blameleſſe in life, ſhall be debarred of the Sacrament, though they preſent not themſelves to the Elderſhip. But whether the Relative <hi>[they]</hi> in the fifth Order re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd not to theſe; and which was the Queſtion your ſelves had propounded to be diſcuſſed; and ſo therefore, whether thoſe, whom the Miniſter having catechized and exhorted to preſent themſelves to the Elderſhip, ought not to have their names publiſhed, and they warned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all to reforme, if they harkened not to the Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation? where we muſt deny, that ever any ſuch a thing was held forth by us in any of the Orders, we publiſhed (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it was that which was by you imputed to us, but have not proved, though to make the matter ſomewhat more colourable, you alter the ſtate of the Queſtion) nor can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch a thing be made out againſt us, either from our pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:119100:187"/>
or the rule we walke by. And further we ſay, that if ever we had practiſed any ſuch a thing, or had profeſſed to walke by any ſuch a rule, there had been reaſon, why we ſhould have been aſhamed. 2. But vve muſt further adde, what we have formerly aſſerted, that we do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to admit any to the Sacrament, meerly upon this ground, becauſe they preſent not themſelves to the Elderſhip, if they be ſuch as are of competent knowledge and blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe life, the Elderſhip condeſcending (as hath been ſaid) to admit upon the Teſtimony of the Miniſter and one El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or of two Miniſters, ſuch as have been by them exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined and approved. Neither is this practice repugnant to any rule laid down in the forme of Church Governement. For however it give a power to the Elderſhip to inquire into the ſpirituall eſtate of any member, as they ſhall ſee occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet it doth not ſtrictly oblige them, to debarre or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject every one, that preſent not themſelves before them; although if it be out of meere obſtinacy of ſpirit, that they refuſe, and a deſire to overturne the Governement by their oppoſition, there is the greater reaſon, why Miniſters and Elders are in ſuch Caſes to beware, as it is requiſite for the ſecuring of the Elderſhips juſt power, and to prevent the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and irregularity of the exerciſe of ſolitary juriſdiction, that none be admitted but by the juridicall act of the Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and which, as it is that which we practice, ſo it is that power which is granted to the Elderſhip, by the Ordinance appointing the forme of Church Governement; <hi>The examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and judgement of ſuch perſons, as ſhall for their ignorance not be admitted to the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, being by that Ordinance to be in the power,</hi> not of any one Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, <hi>but of the Elderſhip of every Congregation; and which as it juſtifies (as we told you) what is in that kinde practiſed by the ſeverall Elderſhips, ſo it alſo ſhews, what ground we had for that, which was mentioned in our Paper, touching both what is therein appointed to the Miniſter about catechizing Families, and alſo concerning the Miniſters exhorting ſuch, as in the ſeverall families he ſhould finde to be of competent knowledge, and knew to be of blameleſſe life, that they ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:119100:187"/>
themſelves to the Elderſhip.</hi> And therefore that we may Anſwer to what you here urge us with, out of the Ordinance, we ſay, it is one thing not to admit any to the Sacrament, but by the juridicall act of the Elderſhip; and another thing to ſay, that none is to be admitted, except they preſent themſelves before the Elderſhip. The power mentioned in the former is granted by the Ordinance unto the Elderſhip, and is that which by us is conſtantly practiſed. In the latter there is a liberty to do, as the Elderſhip ſhall ſee occaſion, and which is in ſeverall Caſes with us diſpenſed with, where the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſhips are otherwiſe ſatisfied touching the fitneſs of the perſons, that are to be by them admitted. And yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this, it is not the Queſtion (as we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſaid) that is now diſcuſſed betwixt you and us, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the knowing and blameleſſe be to be kept off from the Sacrament by any Order of ours, except they ſhall preſent themſelves to the Elderſhip. And hereupon your urging us with the Ordinance for Church government, or our own practice, is not at all to your purpoſe; neither doth it (if it had been as you repreſented, which yet we have ſhewed you is otherwiſe) prove what it concerned you to have made good, <hi>viz. That thoſe that preſent not themſelves to the Elderſhip, upon the Exhortation given by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to that purpoſe, were according to our Order to have had their names publiſhed in the Congregations, and they warned before all to reforme.</hi> Which yet was your high charge, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation of us, but wanting ſupport of it ſelf falls to the ground.</p>
                  <p>And hereupon it is manifeſt, that it is not we, that go about to <hi>mince the matter, or that ſeek to colour over our actions with a ſeeming deniall of all; or to evade, what we ſtill practice, but are aſhamed to own,</hi> as you here without the leaſt ſhadow of proofe affirme of us; neither is there any thing to be found in our Anſwer, that hath any tendency this way, we there profeſſedly defending and juſtifying all that we practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. But it is you, who having laid grevious things to our charge, which you could not prove, would now repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent us, as if we did, as you ſay; that ſo you might ſeem to ſay ſome thing, though when it comes to be ſcan'd, it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:119100:188"/>
but a plaine diſcovery that though your accuſation was loud and ſtrong, your proof is low; weake, and empty, and ſuch as vaniſheth into Aire. <hi>For all the deſcants</hi> (as you call them) <hi>that we made on either Nounes or Pronouns,</hi> was to ſhew, that the Relative <hi>[they]</hi> in the fifth Order could not refer to the Catechized perſons, who being found know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and blameleſſe by the Miniſter, though they ſhould not according to the Exhortation of the Miniſter preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Elderſhip, yet were not to have had their names publiſhed to the Congregation, nor for that warned before all to reforme; and which becauſe you ſaw you could not make out, do therefore (having changed the ſtate of the Queſtion) fall upon our practice, and tell us, <hi>we mince it; or are aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of it;</hi> though this be alſo untrue, and that which you do not prove againſt us neither, and ſo are doubly guilty in this one particular of falſe accuſation. But when to cleare up the ſenſe of our words, we had told you in our Anſwer, that the Relative did often referre to the remoter, and not the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Antecedent, and muſt do ſo, when the matter ſpoken of did require it, and this you here call a <hi>weake, ſenſeleſſe and unheard of deſcanting on Nounes and Pronouns.</hi> You do here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by proclaime your own ignorance; the like deſcanting (if it muſt be ſo called) on <hi>Nounes and Pronounes</hi> being obſerved by the Learned, (as we have ſhewed you) to open and expound the ſenſe of Scripture, and which you your ſelves muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, or you ſhall never be able rightly in ſome places to underſtand them, as from the inſtances we have given, is manifeſt. And you do hereby further diſcover your impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent paſſions, elſe you would not have given us ſuch language as we here (as but too often throughout your Paper) meet with. As touching what follows to the concluſion, we have already ſaid, what is ſufficient for our own vindication. We have <hi>spoken out and owned what is in truth our pactice,</hi> and which we have told you is to admit of none to the Sacrament, but by the juridicall act of the Elderſhip; this being that which is requiſite and neceſſary to be obſerved (as we have told you) or the Governement is indangered to be quite over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown. And yet <hi>none are debarred by us from the Sacrament,
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:119100:188"/>
that are knowing and blameleſſe, becauſe they preſent not themſelves before the Elderſhip,</hi> (which is that you would gladly faſten up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, though herein you labour in vain) but the <hi>ignorant and ſcandalous only.</hi> Although we here muſt minde you, of what we told you even now, <hi>viz.</hi> That this is not the Queſtion that is now diſputed betwixt us. Neither do vve need upon any practice of ours, or any other account whatſoever, <hi>wave the Ordinance</hi> we act upon as repealed; and vvhich however <hi>you do,</hi> yet we muſt not, nor be perſwaded thereunto, either by your threats or intreaties, having proved ſufficiently, that this Ordinance is of <hi>force and ſtrength</hi> to this very day, that and what <hi>we have heretofore ſaid concerning the civill ſanction of our Governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> is ſo much to the <hi>purpoſe,</hi> that it makes this forth.</p>
                  <p>And ſo to conclude, we do not queſtion, but whatever your conceits may be to the contrary, others will determine, that your <hi>high charge</hi> having not been ſupported by reaſon, is of no vveight to the <hi>depreſſing</hi> of us, much leſſe the <hi>Presbyterian go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement,</hi> and vvhich (though vve had fallen not having been able to have vindicated our ſelves from vvhat vve had been accuſed vvith) vvould notwithſtanding have been far above any depreſſion of yours. However vve believe it vvas the <hi>ſumma totalis, and the u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ſhot of all,</hi> that you chiefly aimed at in all your Papers; though how you have therein acquitted your ſelves will be manifeſt enough to the attentive and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiall Reader, vvho vvill eaſily diſcerne by vvhat hath been ſaid, that you have no otherwiſe indeavoured to depreſſe this Governement, but by aſperſing it, vvhen you vvanted Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, vvherewith to oppoſe it; by taking no notice of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons vve urged, vvhen you could not Anſwer them; and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing over many things in our Anſwer in ſilence ſaying no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to them; by betaking your ſelves to the Popiſh princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and practices, refuſing to have the controverſie touching Church governement determined by the Scriptures, and rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on us as Scripturiſts, for contending to have the matter tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this Judge; by aſſerting ſeverall manifeſt untruths, and ſometimes palpably contradictng your ſelves; by falſifying and abuſing approved Proteſtant Authors, vvho favoured not the cauſe you plead for; and aſperſing others, by perverting our
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:119100:189"/>
words and mangling them, vvhen you had a minde to render us abſurd; by many uncivill and unchriſtian expreſſions, which you have uſed toward us, to the reproaching of us; by your ſeverall bitter and reaſonleſs ſcoffes, jeeres, uncharitable cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and ſlanders, laying to our charge ſeverall things, for which you bring no proof, and venting your diſtempered paſſions againſt us only, becauſe we are for Presbyterian and againſt Epiſcopall governement; and to ſumme up all in a word, by hard words, but ſoft and weake Arguments. But all wiſe and ſober perſons will conclude, you fighting againſt us and the Presbyterians governement, with ſuch weapons as theſe, tooke not the way either to depreſs it or us; but have greatly hereby depreſſed your ſelves; and which we mind you of, that you ſeeing your manifold errours herein, might be humbled for them, and prevent that, by unfeigned repentance, which otherwiſe you have cauſe to feare, and whereof we have all along in faithfullneſs warned you, as there hath been occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion offered throughout your Papers, though thereby what is now preſented to the publick view, is ſwelled to the greater bulke. If this our pains, that hath been deſigned for the ends even now mentioned, as well as for the neceſſary vindicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our ſelves and the Governement, the truth and waies of Chriſt, ſhall be ſo farre bleſſed by God, as to bring you to a ſenſe of what you have much offended God and the Church in, and to be aſhamed thereof, we ſhall much rejoyce. But if otherwiſe, we ſhall yet have comfort in this, that we have diſcharged our duty toward you in labouring to reduce you, and ſhall commit what further worke may be called for from us, unto Him, who will own his ſervants in the management of whatſoever he ſets them about.</p>
                  <p>And thus having finiſhed our Anſwer to your two laſt Papers, and been at the pains once more to ſpread before you, what (however you eſteem thereof) others we hope will judge ſufficient for the ſatisfaction of thoſe, that are willing to be ſatisfied: we ſhall now apply our ſelves to what concerns us to practice in purſuance of what we publiſhed in our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, and is now made known to the world; not queſtioning but all wiſe and ſober perſons will judge, that if to
<pb facs="tcp:119100:189"/>
take us off our worke and buſineſſe, you ſhould aſſault us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain after the ſame manner, as hitherto you have done, it will not be fit we ſhould hereafter interrupt our more neceſſary and profitable imployments, in the returning any further An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to you, vvho may perhaps be ambitious to have the laſt vvord; but that rather it will be prudence in us, to ſlight that which having no weight in it, vvill of it ſelf vaniſh away.</p>
