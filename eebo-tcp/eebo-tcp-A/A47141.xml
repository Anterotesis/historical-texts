            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An Exhortation &amp; Caution TO FRIENDS Concerning buying or keeping of <hi>Negroes.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>SEing our Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath taſted Death for every Man, and given himſelf a Ranſom for all, to be teſtified in due time, and that his Goſpel of Peace, Liberty and Redemption from Sin, Bondage and all Oppreſſion, is freely to be preached unto all, without Exception, and that <hi>Negroes, Blacks</hi> and <hi>Taunies</hi> are a real part of Mankind, for whom Chriſt hath ſhed his precious Blood, and are capable of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as well as <hi>White Men;</hi> and Chriſt the Light of the World hath (in meaſure) enlightened them, and every Man that cometh into the World; and that all ſuch who are ſincere <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and true Believers in Chriſt Jeſus, and Followers of him, bear his Image, and are made conformable unto him in Love, Mercy, Goodneſs and Compaſſion, who came not to deſtroy mens Lives, but to ſave them, nor to bring any part of Mankind into outward Bondage, Slavery or Miſery, nor yet to detain them, or hold them therein, but to eaſe and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Oppreſſed and Diſtreſſed, and bring into Liberty both inward and outward.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:95821:2"/>
Therefore we judge it neceſſary that all faithful Friends ſhould diſcover themſelves to be true <hi>Chriſtians</hi> by having the Fruits of the Spirit of Chriſt, which are <hi>Love, Mercy, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Compaſſion</hi> towards all in Miſery, and that ſuffer Oppreſſion and ſevere Uſage, ſo far as in them is poſſible to eaſe and relieve them, and ſet them free of their hard Bondage, whereby it may be hoped, that many of them will be gained by their beholding theſe good Works of ſincere <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and prepared thereby, through the Preaching the Goſpel of Chriſt, to imbrace the true Faith of Chriſt. And for this cauſe it is, as we judge, that in ſome places in <hi>Europe</hi> Negroes cannot be bought and ſold for Money, or detained to be Slaves, becauſe it ſuits not with the Mercy, Love &amp; Clemency that is eſſential to <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> nor to the Doctrine of Chriſt, nor to the Liberty the Goſpel calleth all men unto, to whom it is preached. And to buy Souls and Bodies of men for Money, to enſlave them and their Poſterity to the end of the World, we judge is a great hinderance to the ſpreading of the Goſpel, and is occaſion of much War, Violence, Cruelty and Oppreſſion, and Theft &amp; Robery of the higheſt Nature; for commonly the Negroes that are ſold to white Men, are either ſtollen away or robbed from their Kindred, and to buy ſuch is the way to continue theſe evil Practices of Man-ſteal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and tranſgreſſeth that Golden Rule and Law, <hi>To do to others what we would have others do to us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore, in true <hi>Chriſtian Love,</hi> we earneſtly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it to all our Friends and Brethren, Not to buy any Negroes, unleſs it were on purpoſe to ſet them free, and that ſuch who have bought any, and have them at preſent, after ſome reaſonable time of moderate Service they have had of them, or may have of them, that may reaſonably anſwer to the Charge of what they have laid out, eſpecially in keeping
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95821:2"/>
Negroes Children born in their Houſe, or taken into their Houſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when under Age, that after a reaſonable time of ſervice to anſwer that Charge, they may ſet them at Liberty, and during the time they have them, to teach them to read, and give them a Chriſtian Education.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Some Reaſons and Cauſes of our being againſt keeping of Negroes for Term of Life.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe it is contrary to the Principles and Practice of the <hi>Chriſtian Quakers</hi> to buy Prize or ſtollen Goods, which we bore a faithful Teſtimony againſt in our Native Country; and therefore it is our Duty to come forth in a Teſtimony againſt ſtollen Slaves, it being accounted a far greater Crime under <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law than the ſtealing of Goods<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for ſuch were only to reſtore four fold, <hi>but he that ſtealeth a Man and ſell<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Therefore as we are not to buy ſtollen Goods<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (but if at unawares it ſhould happen through Ignorance, we are to reſtore them to the Owners, and ſeek our Remedy of the Thief) no more are we to buy ſtollen Slaves; neither ſhould ſuch as have them keep them and their Poſterity in perpetual Bondage and Slavery, as is uſually done, to the great ſcandal of the <hi>Chriſtian Profeſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Becauſe Chriſt commanded, ſaying, <hi>All thing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> whatſoever ye would that men ſhould do unto you, do ye even ſo to them.</hi> Therefore as we and our Children would not be kept in perpetual Bondage and Slavery againſt our Conſent, neither ſhould we keep them in perpetual Bondage and Slavery againſt their Conſent, it being ſuch intollerable Puniſhment to their Bodies and Minds, that none but noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious

Criminal Offendors deſerve the ſame. But theſe have done us no harme; therefore how inhumane is it in us ſo grievouſly to oppreſs them and their Children from one Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration to another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Becauſe the Lord hath commanded, ſaying, <hi>Thou ſhalt not deliver unto his Maſter the Servant that is eſcaped from his Master unto thee, he ſhall dwell with thee, even amongſt you in that place which he ſhall chuſe in one of thy Gates, where it liketh him best; thou ſhalt not oppreſs him,</hi> Deut. 23. 15, 16. By which it appeareth, that thoſe which are at Liberty and freed from their Bondage, ſhould not by us be delivered into Bondage again, neither by us ſhould they be oppreſſed, but being eſcaped from his Maſter, ſhould have the liberty to dwell amongſt us, where it liketh him beſt. Therefore, if God extend ſuch Mercy under the legal Miniſtration and Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation to poor Servants, he doth and will extend much more of his Grace and Mercy to them under the clear Goſpel Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration; ſo that inſtead of puniſhing them and their Poſterity with cruel Bondage and perpetual Slavery, he will cauſe the Everlaſting Goſpel to be preached effectually to all Nations, to them as well as others; <hi>And the Lord will extend Peace to his People like a River, and the Glory of the</hi> Gentiles <hi>like a fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Becauſe the Lord hath commanded, ſaying, <hi>Thou</hi>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:95821:3"/>
                  <hi>ſhalt not oppreſs an hired Servant that is poor and needy, whether he be of thy Brethren, or of the Strangers that are in thy Land within thy Gates, leaſt he cry againſt thee unto the Lord, and it be ſin unto thee; Thou ſhalt neither vex a ſtranger nor oppreſs him, for ye were ſtrangers in the Land of</hi> Aegypt, <hi>Deut.</hi> 24. 14, 15. <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 21. But what greater Oppreſſion can there be inflicted upon our Fellow Creatures, than is inflicted on the poor Negroes! they being brought from their own Country againſt their Wills, ſome of them being ſtollen, others taken for payment of Debt owing by their Parents, and others taken Captive in War, and ſold to Merchants, who bring them to the <hi>American</hi> Plantations, and ſell them for Bond-Slaves to them that will give moſt for them; the Husband from the Wife, and the Children from the Parents; and many that buy them do exceedingly afflict them and oppreſs them, not only by continual hard Labour, but by cruel Whippings; and other cruel Puniſhments, and by ſhort allowance of Food, ſome Planters in <hi>Barbadoes</hi> and <hi>Jamaica,</hi> 'tis ſaid, keeping one hundred of them, and ſome more, and ſome leſs, and giving them hardly any thing more than they raiſe on a little piece of Ground appointed them, on which they work for themſelves the ſeventh dayes of the Week in the after-noon, and on the firſt days, to raiſe their own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, to wit, Corn and Potatoes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and other Roots, &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the remainder of their time being ſpent in their Maſters ſervice; which doubtleſs is far worſe uſage than is practiſed by the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Moors</hi> upon their Slaves. Which tends to the great Reproach of the <hi>Chriſtian Profeſſion;</hi> therefore it would be better for all ſuch as fall ſhort of the Practice of thoſe <hi>Infidels,</hi> to refuſe the Name of a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> that thoſe <hi>Heathen</hi> and <hi>Infidels</hi> may not be provoked to blaſpheme againſt the bleſſed Name of Chriſt, by reaſon of the unparallel'd

Cruelty of theſe cruel and hard hearted pretended <hi>Chriſtians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Surely the Lord doth behold their Oppreſſions &amp; Afflictions, and will further viſit for the ſame by his righteous and juſt Judgments, except they break off their ſins by Repentance, and their Iniquity by ſhewing Mercy to theſe poor afflicted, tormented miſerable Slaves!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Becauſe Slaves and Souls of Men are ſome of the <hi>Merchandize of Babylon</hi> by which the Merchants of the Earth are made Rich; but thoſe Riches which they have heaped together, through the cruel Oppreſſion of theſe miſerable Creatures, will be a means to draw Gods Judgments upon them; therefore, <hi>Brethren,</hi> let us hearken to the Voice of the Lord, who ſaith, <hi>Come out of</hi> Babylon, <hi>my People, that ye be not partakers of her Sins, and that ye receive not her Plaegues; for her Sins have reached unto Heaven, and God hath remembred her Iniquities; for he that leads into Captivity ſhall go into Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity,</hi> Rev. 18. 4, 5. &amp; 13. 10.</p>
