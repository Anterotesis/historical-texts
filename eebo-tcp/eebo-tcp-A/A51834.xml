            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <q>And I heard a voice from heaven, saying unto me, write, Blessed are the dead, which dye in the Lord, from henceforth, yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours, and their works do follow them.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He chief wisdom of a man is to <hi>live well,</hi> and <hi>dye well,</hi> to live <hi>godly,</hi> and dye <hi>blessed</hi>; the same corruption of nature that makes us unwilling to live well, makes us unwilling to dye; To <hi>forsake our corruptions,</hi> and <hi>go out of the world,</hi> are both displeasing to flesh and blood; therefore we need to be prest often both to the one, and the other, for the one maketh way for the other.</p>
            <p>Upon this occasion I know not a more seasonable Argument; in Autumn, when we see one lease, or a few leaves fall, we conclude the rest will follow after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; every Funeral should put us in minde that our death is not far off. Some of us have cause to expect the <hi>next turn: Old men</hi> in Scripture account are <hi>as good as dead</hi> already, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.12. Those that lived longest, dyed at last: <hi>Enos</hi> lived 905, <hi>Kenan</hi> 910,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:47527:4"/>
               <hi>Seth</hi> 912, <hi>Adam</hi> 930, <hi>Jared</hi> 962, <hi>Methuselah</hi> 969 yeers, but they all dyed. All must dye; the great care should be to dye well; none can dye well, but those that <hi>dye in the Lord,</hi> for they are <hi>blessed</hi>; so it is proclaimed from heaven. Every divine truth comes from heaven; but some are more solemnly proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from thence; as the <hi>mortality of man,</hi> and the <hi>blessedness of the dead</hi>; the mortality of man, <hi>Isa.</hi> 40.6. our affections are against the thought of that. <hi>The blessedness of the dead,</hi> in this place, against which carnal reason opposeth Nature will so hardly bel<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eve that the dead can be blessed, that we need <hi>a voice from heaven</hi> to confirm it,</p>
            <p>The context speaks of many troubles to try the patience of the Saints; now the comfort propounded is the blessed estate of the departed; the worst that wicked men can do to the Saints, is but to help them the sooner to heaven.</p>
            <p>In the words observe a <hi>Preface,</hi> and a <hi>Doctrine</hi>; The preface shews it is a matter of weight: here is a <hi>voice from heaven,</hi> and a command to <hi>write</hi> for the more assurance, an open publication.</p>
            <p n="2">2 In the Doctrine you have an <hi>assertion,</hi> and an <hi>am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plification</hi>; in the <hi>assertion,</hi> the <hi>qualification, the dead which dye in the Lord</hi>; the <hi>priviledge, are blessed.</hi> In the <hi>amp<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

could look upon it as the end of misery; but Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans look upon it as a beginning of Glory and happiness.</p>
            <p>Because I shall not be able to discuss <hi>the amplificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> let me open some of the Circumstances.</p>
            <p>[<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>from henceforth</hi>]. Those that <hi>dyed</hi> in the Lord in former ages were blessed; but these times did require this singular comfort, because of the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful persecution, and that from those who carryed the name of <hi>Christians:</hi> Now saith the Holy Ghost, not onely those that suffered by <hi>heathens</hi> are blessed, and counted the <hi>Lords Martyrs</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but those that suffer al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so under <hi>Pseudo-Christians.</hi> Some indeed carry it in another sense, as if it were said, before Antichrist can down, it will cost the Church such a world of trouble, that from henceforth you will count the dead happy, as being taken <hi>from the evil to come,</hi> Isa. 57.1. Others thus [from henceforth] that is, after salvation offered to the Gentiles in the Gospel, the dead shall be known to be happy; as the Apostle saith, that 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.10. <hi>Life and immortality is brought to light in the Gospel.</hi> Others apply this [from henceforth] to the time of their death, as if the Saints were here asserted to be immediately happy upon their dissolution. But I think the fi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>st Exposition most simple and genuine.</p>
            <p>[<hi>Rest from their labours</hi>] troubles, services, the <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours</hi> of their callings, the <hi>troubles</hi> of their condition. The godly are taken away <hi>from evil,</hi> and the wicked are taken away <hi>to evil.</hi> From glorifying and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God they never rest, but from wear<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ness in ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God, from weakness, sin, and distraction.</p>
            <p>[<hi>Their works follow them</hi>]. As it is said of wicked men, <hi>their iniquity shall finde them out.</hi> We carry no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing out of the world with us but the Conscience and comfort of what we have done for God; their

               <hi>wealth</hi> doth not follow them into the other world, but their <hi>works</hi> do.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> The point which I shall prosecute is the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion of the Text; <hi>That they that dye in the Lord are in a blessed condition.</hi> I shall inquire,</p>
            <p n="1">1 What it <hi>is to dye in the Lord?</hi> 2 Shew you how they <hi>are blessed.</hi> 3 Whence it is that they who dye in the Lord, are sure to be in a blessed condition.</p>
            <p n="1">1 What <hi>it is to dye in the Lord</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] may be rendred <hi>for the Lord,</hi> or <hi>in the Lord</hi>; as <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.1. <hi>Paul a prisoner in the Lord,</hi> we render it <hi>of the Lord</hi> or <hi>for the Lords sake.</hi> 1 Thess. 4.16. We render, <hi>the dead in Christ</hi> shall rise first, and ver. 14. <hi>those that sleep in Jesus.</hi> Which is to be preferred? I answer, neither is to be excluded; whether a godly man fall as <hi>a peace-offering</hi> or as <hi>a burnt-offering,</hi> he is still in a happy condition.</p>
            <p>[To dye in the Lord] may relate either to the <hi>cause</hi> for which, or to the <hi>state</hi> wherein, or to the <hi>manner</hi> how <hi>we dye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>The cause</hi> for which we dye. So the Martyrs dye <hi>in the Lord</hi> or for the Lords sake; and are <hi>blessed of God,</hi> though, it may be <hi>cursed of men.</hi> The Text relates to the time of <hi>Antichristian persecution,</hi> when usually they dyed <hi>excommunicate</hi> or <hi>accursed</hi> by the Roman Synagogue. God hath a special regard to his Champions that <hi>love not their lives to the death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>The state,</hi> wherein we dye; so <hi>to dye in the Lord</hi> is to dye in the favour of God; in a state of peace with him as members of Christs mystical body; they dye in the bosom of Christ; <hi>sleep in Jesus.</hi> 1 Cor. 15.18. are reconciled to God in and through him. There are two notable expressions which I shall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to you upon this occasion; One is in the 2 <hi>Pet.</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:47527:5"/>
3.14. <hi>That we may be found of him in peace</hi>; To dye before the quarrel be taken up between us and God, that is sad. When a Town is surprized by force, they that are taken with their weapons in their hands, dye without mercy; but blessed are they that dye in peace. The other is in the 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.3. <hi>that I may not be found naked.</hi> To be summoned to come before God, and to have nothing to cover our nakedness, that is sad; it should be our care to be wrapt in Christs <hi>righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>; that is the best shroud for a dying Christian.</p>
            <p n="3">3 As <hi>to the manner</hi>; they are said to dye in the Lord, who dye in a gracious manner; it much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth us and the glory of God that we dye well; a Christian is not onely to <hi>live</hi> to the glory of God, but to <hi>dye</hi> to the glory of God, <hi>for living and dying we are the Lords,</hi> Rom. 14.7, 8. As to the manner [<hi>to dye in the Lord</hi>] signifyeth. 1 <hi>Our perseverance in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him,</hi> to continue our blessed fellowship with Christ to the death and in the death.

So till all be finished, we should follow our work close. <hi>Let us take heed</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>lest we seem to come short</hi> (<hi>Heb.</hi> 4.1. As we should not <hi>come short,</hi> we should not <hi>seem</hi> to come short. <hi>Enoch</hi> lived a long while, but all that while he walked with God, 365 yeers, a long age, but spent in communion with God! <hi>Gen.</hi> 5.22. 2 It implies the solemn actings of grace at death, the Scripture takes notice of <hi>the last words</hi> of Saints. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.1. the last words of <hi>David.</hi> Death is a special season wherein to make use of Grace; of <hi>faith, love, zeal, and obedience.</hi>

not enough to <hi>live by Faith,</hi> but we must also <hi>dye by Faith.</hi> This is a Grace always of use on this side the Grave; in the other world there is no need of it, when we come to injoyment, Faith ceaseth; at death it doth us the <hi>last office</hi>; we see what it is then to put the soul into Gods keeping. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Luke</hi> 23.46. <hi>Act.</hi> 7.59. Then do we dye in faith, when we can resi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n our souls to God, and send our bodies to the Grave in hope. While we are alive, we finde it harder to depend upon God for daily bread, then for eternal life for herein faith is put upon a present tryal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but when we come to dye, the strength of our confidence is tryed about the blessed recompences. This then is to dye in the Lord, when we can look beyond the <hi>grave,</hi> and within the veil, into the glory of the world to come.</p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>Love</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In our readiness and willingness to be with Christ, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.23. <hi>I desire to be dissolved and be with Christ.</hi> The <hi>Spirit and the Bride say come</hi>; now God takes you at your word, and you draw back, Let him be afraid to dye, that would not go to Christ.</p>
            <p n="3">3 <hi>Zeal for Gods glory</hi>; It is the last time you can do any thing for God in the world; put in a word for him; commend him to those about you; as <hi>Jacob</hi> doth the Mediator, or the <hi>Angel of the Covenant,</hi> of whom he had such experience in the course of his pilgrimage, <hi>Gen.</hi> 48.16. and <hi>Joshua</hi> 23. <hi>Josh.</hi> 14. <hi>I am going the way of all the earth, and you know in all your hearts, and all your souls, not one thing hath failed of all the good things, which the Lord your God hath spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken</hi>; all is come to pass, not one thing hath failed thereof. Words of dying men are of most efficacy and authority, as being spoken out of all their former experience, with <hi>most simplicity,</hi> without self-seeking,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:47527:6"/>
or sinister ends, with <hi>most seriousness</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for men en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring upon the confines of Eternity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are wiser and more serious; it is no time to dally and dissemble at the last gasp; speeches of living men are <hi>suspected</hi> of partiality to their present interests; or <hi>neglected</hi> as having no weight in them; but the speeches of dying men are solemnly observed; therefore <hi>Josephs</hi> bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren to ingage him the more, urge him with his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers dying charge, <hi>Gen.</hi> 50.16. <hi>Thy father, when he dyed, said</hi> &amp;c. Men, as they are returning <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> to the <hi>original Divinity,</hi> as <hi>Plotinus</hi> speaks, are supposed to be more divine, and therefore their dying words are much regarded. Put in then a word for God; an Amen to the Promises. Carnal men cannot honor their Principles when they dye; the world fails them, when there is most need, <hi>Job</hi> 27 8. <hi>what hope hath a hypocrite, when God comes to take away his soul <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> When they are going out of the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then they fall a complaining, how the world hath deceived them; but a Christian when he dyes, he may honor his Principles; commend the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; give an account of the faithfulness of the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator; and <hi>plead</hi> for God at the last gasp.</p>
            <p n="4">4 <hi>Obedience.</hi> A Christian is not to dye like a beast, to be <hi>meerly passive,</hi> his soul is not <hi>taken away,</hi> but <hi>yielded up</hi>; there is a resignation and consent on his part. A carnal man <hi>suffers death</hi>; but a <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an gives up the Ghost.</hi> The Scripture useth this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctness of speech concerning them, as concerning the wicked, <hi>God takes away their souls,</hi> Luke 12.19. <hi>Job</hi> 27.8. they would fain keep them longer; but the Lord puts the Bond in suit, and per-force they are dragged into his presence; but now death to the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it is a <hi>sweet dismission,</hi> Luke 2.26. When they see
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:47527:7"/>
the will of God, they hold out no longer; their souls are not taken away, but yielded up to God:</p>
            <p>Thus you see Grace stands by us, when all things else fail; it makes us live with comfort, and dye with comfort. When wealth fails, Grace fails us not. So much of the first question.</p>
            <p n="2">2. How they are blessed. They are <hi>presently bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</hi> upon the departure of the soul out of the body; but <hi>more blessed</hi> at the general Resurrection of the just.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Presently the soul is where Christ is; carryed by Angels to Christ, and by Christ presented to God, as the fruit of his purchase. That the soul is where Christ is, appears by that of <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.2, 3. <hi>I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to be dissolved and be with Christ,</hi> to be with him in glory; otherwise it were <hi>a loss,</hi> not <hi>a happiness</hi> for St. <hi>Paul</hi> to be dissolved; it is a sorry blessedness to lye rotting in the Grave; and onely to be eased of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent labours; for Gods people are wont to reckon much of their present service and enjoyment of God, though it be accompanyed with troubles and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. <hi>Paul</hi> was in a straight, and he saith it was [<gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> 
               <hi>much more better to be with Christ</hi>] A stupid sleep without the injoyment of God is not much more better then our present condition, but far worse; what happiness were that to be in such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, wherein we do nothing for God, injoy nothing from God? Surely <hi>Paul</hi> would never be in <hi>such a straight,</hi> if this <hi>drousie Doctrine</hi> were true, that the soul lyes in such an unactive state of sleep and rest till the Resurrection. This is to be no more blessed then stones, and inanimate creatures, that feel nothing.

               </gap>, this day] answers to the Thieves [when thou shalt come into thy kingdom]. Christ promiseth more then he asks (as God doth usually a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly for us <hi>above what we can ask or think</hi>); He hath reference to Christs words to the High-Priest; the Son of man shall come in his glory; now saith Christ, I will not defer thy desire so long, for present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shall heavenly joys attend thy soul. Others seek to evade it by the word [Paradise] it is a <hi>Persicke word,</hi> but used by the Hebrews for Gardens and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards, and by allusion for heavenly joys; and possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly the allusion might be taken not from the delights of an <hi>ordinary Garden</hi>; but from <hi>Eden,</hi> or that Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in which <hi>Adam</hi> was placed in innocency. That by <hi>Paradise</hi> is meant <hi>heaven,</hi> and not those <hi>secreta animarum receptacula &amp; beatae sedes,</hi> some secret places for the repose of souls departed, which some of the Fathers fancyed, appeared by <hi>Pauls</hi> expression in the 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.4. speaking of his rapture, <hi>I was (saith he) caught up into the third heaven,</hi> which he presently calls <hi>Paradise.</hi> Well then, out of the whole we may conclude, that the souls immediately upon their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture out of their bodies are with Christ. Again it is said <hi>Luke</hi> 16.22. <hi>The beggar dyed and was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed into Abrahams bosom,</hi> presently, in the twinckling of an eye, or turning of a thought. Thus it is with the Saints, which is a great comfort; when we come to dye, in a moment Angels will bring you to Christ; Agonies of death are terrible, but there are joys just ready; and as soon as you are loosed from the prison of your body, you enter into your eternal rest, the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:47527:8"/>
soul flyeth hence to Christ. Once more; as the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked are in their final estate as soon as they dye, and therefore they are called [<hi>the Spirits now in prison</hi>] 1 Pet 3.19. so do the godly injoy their glorifyed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state as soon as they dye; [<hi>the spirits of just men are made perfect</hi>] <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.24. How can their spirits be said to be perfect, if they lye onely in a <hi>dull sleep</hi> without any <hi>light, life, joy, delight,</hi> or act of love to God?</p>
            <p n="2">2 They are compleatly blest at the Resurrection; what their blessedness shall be then, we cannot now know to the full; we shall understand it best, when the <hi>great voice calls us to come up and see</hi>; Onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>our ear hath received a little thereof,</hi> let me en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devor to lay it before you. In <hi>blessedness</hi> there must be</p>
            <p n="1">1 A <hi>removal of all evils.</hi> 2 A <hi>coacervation,</hi> and <hi>compleat presence of all goods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1 A <hi>removal of evil</hi>; as long as the least evil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues, a man is not blessed, onely <hi>less miserable. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> had all things that a carnal heart could wish for; he guided the affairs of 127 Provinces; onely he wanted <hi>Mordecals</hi> knee; therefore he saith, <hi>all this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails me nothing. Ahab</hi> had the kingdom of <hi>Israel,</hi> and yet falls sick for want of <hi>Naboth</hi>'s Vineyard. In engines of war, if one peg be missing, or out of order, all stops. In the body of man, if one humour be out of order, or joynt broken, it is enough to make us ill at ease, though all the rest be sound and whole: so if if there be the <hi>least evil,</hi> a man cannot be a compleat happy man. Well then; from this blessed estate of the dead in the Lord, All evil is removed. Now evil is twofold; either of <hi>Sin</hi> or <hi>Punishment</hi>: In heaven there is neither.</p>

Your iniquities have separated, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Let a man be never so loathsom, yet if he be in a state of grace, he is dear to God; the Lord takes pleasure in him; though he should be rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cast with Ulcers and sores in a prison, yet God will <hi>kiss him with the kisses of his mouth</hi>; there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing loathsome and odious to God but sin. This grieves the Saints most, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.23. <hi>Oh wretched man that I am,</hi> &amp;c. if any man had cause to complain of afflictions, <hi>Paul</hi> had; <hi>in perils often, in perils by Land, in perils by Sea, in perils by enemies, in perils by false brethren, whipped, imprisoned, sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi>; but he doth not cry out, <hi>when shall I be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from these afflictions,</hi> but <hi>this body of death; Lust</hi> troubled him more then <hi>scourges</hi>; and his <hi>capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity to the Law of sin,</hi> more then <hi>chains</hi> and <hi>prisons.</hi> This is the disposition of the Saints, they are weary of the world, because they are <hi>sinning here,</hi> whilst others are <hi>glorifying God</hi>; not onely that they are <hi>suffering</hi> here, whilst others are <hi>injoying God.</hi> A beast will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake the place where he hath neither meat nor rest; Carnal men, when they are beaten out of the word, have a fancy to heaven as <hi>a place of retreat:</hi> but that which troubles godly men is their sin; well now, in Heaven there is no sin; there is neither <hi>spot</hi> nor <hi>wrinckle</hi> upon the face of glorifyed Saints, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.27 They were once as black as you; but now Christ

            <p n="2">2 The next evil is the <hi>evil of affliction</hi>; whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is painful and burthensom to nature, is a fruit of the fall; a brand and mark of our Rebellion against God; therefore <hi>affliction</hi> must be done away as well as <hi>sin</hi> if we be compleatly happy.

            <p n="1">1 Let me speak of the happiness of <hi>his person</hi>; and then both of his <hi>body</hi> and <hi>soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1 For his body, it is now a Temple of the Holy-Ghost; he cannot leave his mansion, and ancient dwelling-place, and therefore he raiseth it up and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth it again into a compleat fashion, like <hi>Christs glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious body,</hi> Phil. 3.21. for <hi>clarity, agility, strength, incorruption. Solomons</hi> Temple, when it was destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the <hi>latter house</hi> was nothing so glorious as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; men <hi>wept</hi> when they saw it, <hi>Ezr</hi> 2. but it is not so here; it is raised quite another body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent there is to be seen a <hi>beautiful fabrick</hi> wherein God hath shown his workmanship; every member, if it were not so common, would be a miracle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered for the service and comeliness of the whole; but now it is a <hi>vile body,</hi> subject to diseases, fed with meat, humbled with wants, many times mangled with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, dissolved by death, and crumbled to dust in the grave, like a dry clod of earth, this is the body we carry about us: a mass of flesh drest up to be a dish for the worms; but this <hi>vile body</hi> shall rise in another manner, <hi>like Christs glorious body</hi>: when the Sun ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, the stars vanish, their lustre is eclipsed and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; but the Sun of Righteousness when he appears at the last day, doth not <hi>obscure,</hi> but <hi>perfect</hi> our glory. More particularly. If you inquire, wherein our bodies shall be like Christs glorious body, the Apostle will tell
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:47527:11"/>
us that in another place, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.40, 41, 42, 43, 44. Let me single out three expressions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is raised in <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruption</hi>; it is raised <hi>in glory,</hi> it is raised <hi>a spiritual body.</hi> 1 It is an <hi>incorruptible body</hi>; now it yields to the decays of nature, and is exercised with pains and aches, till at length it droppeth down like ripe fruit into the Grave, but hereafter it shall be <hi>cloathed with immortality</hi> wholly impassible; what a comfort is this to those, that are racked with the Stone or Gout, broken with Diseases or withered with age, to think that they shall have a body without aches &amp; without decays, that shall always be in the spring of youth; the Trees of Paradise are always green. 2 It shall be <hi>a glorious body</hi>; here it is many times deformed; at least beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty like a flower is lost, in sickness; daver'd or withered with age, defaced by several accidents; but then we shall be glorious like to Christs body: the <hi>naked bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> of man was so beautiful in innocency, that the beasts of the field admired it, and thereupon did homage to <hi>Adam</hi>; but we shall not be conformed to the first <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> but the second; Christ in the Mount, when he was transfigured they could not indure <hi>the shining of his garments,</hi> it astonished the Disciples, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17. His Garments could not vail, nor their eys indure those strong emissions of the beams of glory; <hi>Paul</hi> could not indure the light that shined to him, when Christ appeared to him from heaven, <hi>Act.</hi> 9. but was utterly confounded and struck blinde; by this you may guess a little at the glory of the body, when it is likened to Christs glorious body: <hi>Moses</hi> by conversing with God forty days, the complexion of his face was altered so, that they were glad to put a vail upon it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In this low estate in which we are, we must make use of these hints. 3 <hi>A spiritual body,</hi> either for <hi>agility</hi>; we shall
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:47527:12"/>
not be clogged as now; we shall be <hi>caught up in the air to meet the Lord</hi>; or rather a <hi>spiritual body,</hi> because more disposed for spiritual uses, for the <hi>injoyments</hi> and the <hi>imployments</hi> of Grace: Here it is a <hi>natural body,</hi> an unready instrument for the soul; we are not in a capacity to bear the new wine of glory; but there we are made more capacious, and stronger vessels to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain all that God will give out. The Disciples fainted at Christs transfiguration, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.6. we cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive such large diffusions and overflowings of glory as we shall then have; every strong affection and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed thought doth overset us and cause extasie and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishment; but there it is otherwise; God maketh out himself to us in a greater latitude, and we are more able to bear it.</p>
            <p n="2">2 For the <hi>blessedness of the soul,</hi> which is the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of heaven, our happiness is called <hi>the inheritance of the Saints in light,</hi> Col. 1.12. for which we must be prepared<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is not for them that know no other heaven, but to eat, drink, and sleep, and wallow in fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and gross pleasures: It is an <hi>inheritance in light</hi>; and for Saints that know how to value intellectual and spiritual delights. Wherein, you will say, lyes the happiness of the soul! in knowledge or love? <hi>Ans.</hi> Divines are divided; certainly in both; our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness consists in the <hi>love of God,</hi> and <hi>knowledge of God</hi> from whence results <hi>union with God</hi> and <hi>fruition of God</hi>; it is hard to say which is to be preferred, to <hi>know God,</hi> or <hi>love God</hi>; in one place the Scripture tells us <hi>this is life eternal to know the onely true God,</hi> Joh. 17. so that it seems to be the heaven of heaven, to have the understanding satisfyed with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 17.15. <hi>When I awake I shall be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfyed with thine image and likeness:</hi> On the other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,

            <p n="1">1 There is <hi>the perfection of knowledge</hi>; all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties must be satisfyed, before we can be happy; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially so noble a faculty as the minde is; there is a <hi>natural inclination</hi> to knowledge; the soul takes a great deal of contentment in the contemplation of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny truth; <hi>the knowledge of wisdom to thy soul</hi> (saith <hi>Solomon</hi>) <hi>shall be as the hony-comb when thou hast found it.</hi> Prov. 24 13, 14. right and cleer thoughts of God breed <hi>a rejoycing,</hi> Psal. 19.10. Well then, this is no small part of our happiness to have <hi>more light and knowledge of God</hi> and of his ways; we shall know many mysteries of salvation, that we are now igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of; as, the <hi>nature of God,</hi> Psal. 17.15. <hi>I shall be satisfyed with thy image and likeness; the union of the two natures</hi> in the person of Christ, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.24. <hi>they shall behold my glory</hi>; our <hi>union with Christ</hi> and by Christ with God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.20. <hi>In that day they shall know that I am in the Father,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>the course of Gods Decrees</hi> and <hi>Providences</hi> for our good, 1 Cor. 13.12.

These are the deeps of God, and now there is darkness upon the face of these deeps<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Church is but <hi>a Grammer-School,</hi> heaven is the <hi>Universitie</hi>; we shall have <hi>other eys,</hi> and <hi>other light<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> prophesie is but in part</hi> now, our <hi>intuition</hi> shall be then <hi>immediate,</hi> Joh 1.3.2. <hi>We shall see him as he is</hi>; now we see him not as he is, but as he is pleased to reveal himself; now we see what <hi>he is not,</hi> not corruptible, not mortal, not changeable, rather then what he is.

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>First, From <hi>their union with Christ,</hi> which can never be dissolved; death severeth <hi>body</hi> and <hi>soul,</hi> but not <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>the soul.</hi> From this union there result two things, <hi>Conformity with Christ</hi> in every estate, and <hi>the Communion of the Spirit</hi>; both which do imply the blessedness of the Saints, even after death. They that are united with Christ do share with him in every estate; <hi>in grace</hi> here and <hi>in glory</hi> hereafter; as to both, they are <hi>predestinated to be conformed to the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of Christ</hi>: Rom. 8.29. And where the Spirit once dwelleth, there he dwelleth for ever; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from the indwelling of <hi>the Spirit of holiness</hi> doth the Apostle infer our Resurrection to a glorious estate, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.11. And that <hi>losing nothing</hi> which Christ speaketh of, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.39. I would interpret of his not
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:47527:15"/>
losing one member or joynt of his mystical body.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>From the Covenant of God with them.</hi> Christ proves the Resurrection from Gods being the <hi>God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,</hi> Mat. 22.32. the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument stands upon three feet. 1 To be a God to any is to be <hi>a benefactor,</hi> for the tenor of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant on Gods part is, <hi>I will be thy God,</hi> as on our part, you shall be my people. 2 That God would be an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting benefactor, it implyes an <hi>eternal communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> of <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>glory</hi>; as Christ proves from <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.6. that God assumed this Title after their death. 3 This Covenant was made with the whole man, not onely with <hi>the soul</hi> but <hi>the body,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they bore <hi>the mark</hi> and the <hi>sign</hi> of it, which was <hi>Circumcision,</hi> in their bodies. And in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.16. the Apostle saith that because God had a heavenly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance to bestow upon the Patriarchs, <hi>therefore he was not ashamed to be called their God,</hi> implying that if they had no other reward then what they injoyed in the present life, God could not with honor (such was the slenderness and contemptibleness of their present condition) have owned such a glorious Title and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation, as to be called <hi>the God of Abraham.</hi> What needs further arguing? the phrase it self imports what we assert. When God promiseth to <hi>be a God to any</hi> he maketh over his whole self, his eternity and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finiteness for their comfort and use; and so in effect saith that he wil be an <hi>everlasting benefactor</hi> to their whole <hi>persons</hi> in the way of an <hi>infinite power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us now apply all!</p>
            <p n="1">1 Because <hi>this priviledge</hi> is exprest <hi>with a limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> it informeth us that the wicked are excluded, they must expect a quite contrary estate; as they <hi>that

dye in the Lord</hi> are in a <hi>blessed,</hi> so all others in a <hi>cursed condition.</hi> It is a sweet close when the <hi>body</hi> and <hi>soul</hi> part, but <hi>God</hi> and <hi>the soul</hi> meet; when <hi>Conscience</hi> shall become <hi>our compurgator</hi> and bear us witness that we have spent our time well, in fearing God and obeying God, then may <hi>the body</hi> and <hi>soul</hi> take leave of one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother with an expectation to meet again in Glory. But it is a sad parting when Conscience falls a raving, and the <hi>body</hi> and <hi>the soul</hi> accuse one another; the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy accuseth the soul, as an <hi>ill guide,</hi> and the soul the body as an <hi>unready instrument.</hi> And at the day of their death, which is the <hi>time of separation,</hi> they curse the day of their birth, which was the time of <hi>the first union</hi> between them both, when they shall wish that they had been stifled in the womb, and had never seen the light, rather then to have lived together in such a fashion, and to part in such manner. Now this many times is the case of wicked men at their death, death cometh to them as a <hi>double evil,</hi> as a <hi>natural evil,</hi> stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the body and dissolving the confederacy and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between it and the soul; and as a <hi>penal evil,</hi> or the <hi>curse of the first Covenant,</hi> wounding the Conscience and reviving their bondage and fears of a worse judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ensue. And then though <hi>Physitians</hi> and <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters</hi> be sent for, they may both prove of no value either to prevent the dissolution, or to give ease to the Conscience.</p>
            <p n="2">2 It presseth us to provide for this hour, that when we come to dye we may <hi>dye in the Lord.</hi> Get an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in Christ that you may dye in the Lord as <hi>to your estate.</hi> Security will not hold out, when you lanch into the other world; a wicked man <hi>comes to himself</hi> when he comes to dye. <hi>At his latter end he shall be a fool,</hi> Jer. 17.11. he was ever a fool, but then he shall
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:47527:16"/>
be one in <hi>the conviction and acknowledgement of his own Conscience,</hi> his own heart will make him cry out, <hi>Oh fool, mad-man, that I was to be contented with such slight evidences for Eternity.</hi> You see then it is good to be upon sure terms, and to get our union with Christ so cleer and sensible, that <hi>when we walk in the valley of the shadow of death we may not be afraid,</hi> Psal. 23. As to <hi>the frame of your hearts,</hi> it is a harder matter to dye well then you are aware of; if you would <hi>dye well, live well,</hi> otherwise you do but provide matter of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair and sorrow for your latter end. It is every ones wish, <hi>Oh that I might dye the death of the righteous</hi>! Numb. 23. but it is not every ones happiness.</p>
            <p>If you would dye in the Lord, you had need to have <hi>Promises ready</hi> and your <hi>faith well exercised,</hi> that you may have <hi>good proof</hi> of it before it comes to stead you in death. <hi>In bello non licet his peccare.</hi> As <hi>in war</hi> so <hi>in death</hi> there is no erring twice, then you are to throw your last cast for everlasting woe or weale; to do that which you never did before; you had need of <hi>armour of proof</hi>; to deal with the <hi>last enemy.</hi> How foolishly do they deal that defer all to this hour, &amp; are then to get faith when they should reduce it into pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice? Faith is a Grace wrought by degrees to strength and perfection; now to put it to the hardest tryal at first is absurd and irrational. You should have your E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences cleer, your promises ready, your experiences at hand, that you may be able to comfort your selves, and too plead for God, and to speak to the standers-by of the long proof you have had of his being <hi>a good Master,</hi> and <hi>a gracious father</hi> to you. How is it then? Are all things set at rights between God and your souls? Have you laid up comforts for this great day of expence? Is your dying speech ready? Are you
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:47527:17"/>
provided of experiences whereby to commend the Mercifulness and faithfulness of your Redeemer. Can you say that you have tryed him often, and he never failed you all your days? If it be so, indeed your great work is done.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Use.</hi> To encourage the children of God to be more willing to dye. Are you afraid to enter upon your own blessedness and glory? Will you shun Christs company when he desires yours? Love brought Christ <hi>out of heaven,</hi> that he might be with us; he thought of it before the world was, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.31. and longed for the time, in effect saying, When will it come? We are to go from <hi>earth to heaven,</hi> from conversing <hi>with men</hi> to converse <hi>with Angels,</hi> and why so loath to remove? What could Christ ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect upon his coming into the world but hard usage? but labour, and griefs, and shame, and death? he came to taste the <hi>Vinegar and the Gall</hi>; we are called to the <hi>feast of love</hi>; to taste of hidden Manna, and the Rivers of pleasure that flow in his presence. If you love Christ, why should you be unwilling to be in the arms of Christ? to <hi>be there where he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding his glory? love is an affection of union,</hi> it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireth to be with the party loved; and can you be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to be dissolved and to be with Christ? Death is the Chariot that is to carry you into his presence. <hi>Jacobs</hi> spirit revived when he saw the Waggons which <hi>Joseph</hi> sent to carry him into AEgypt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 45.27. what is there in the world to be compared with heaven? either there must be <hi>something in the world</hi> to detain us; or we are frighted at the <hi>terribleness of the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage,</hi> or else there is <hi>a contempt of what is to come<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> You cannot say any thing of the world is more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy then Christ; in this sense you renounced <hi>father,

It was the language of your souls then, <hi>whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none on earth that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire besides thee,</hi> Psal. 73.25. Did you dissemble then? Or have you found cause since to retreat and begrudge your affections to him? Christ puts you to the tryal when sickness comes, he hath sent h<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Is it <hi>the terribleness of the passage</hi>? doth nature grudge at the thought of a dissolution? where is your faith? <hi>death is yours</hi> 1 Cor. 3.18. Your <hi>friend,</hi> your <hi>advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage</hi>; Christ hath assured you of it; will you trust his word? you love him little when you have no confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in what he saith. Or is it <hi>contempt of things to come?</hi> Then why is all this cost? why came Christ to lay down his soul to purchase that which you care not for? what needs all this waste? Christians hear for the time to come, we know not how soon we may be sent for, and put to the tryal, it is good to be resolved, that we may say the sooner the better.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Let this comfort us concerning our friends, that dye in the Lord. 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 4.18. <hi>Comfort one another with these words.</hi> This is proper, <hi>Christian, Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture comfort.</hi> Heathens to comfort one another, can onely say that death is the common passage out of this world, that all that are born must dye. But Christians can comfort one another upon better terms that they <hi>that sleep in Jesus are blessed,</hi> and shall we whine at their preferment? that we shall all meet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in the other world; that a day will come when the Captain of our Salvation will have <hi>his great ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvouz,</hi> and the head of the Church call all the Saints into <hi>one Congregation</hi>; Psal. 1.5. and the whole
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:47527:18"/>
flock shall follow the great shepherd of the sheep into their everlasting fold, triumphing and saying, <hi>Oh death where is thy sting? Oh grave where is thy victory</hi>? These are comforts proper for <hi>Christians</hi>; especially for <hi>Ministers</hi> that are messengers of comfort to others that have more frequent advantages of meditation upon those priviledges then others have. Shall we murmur? and yield to sinkings of heart when God hath made a breach upon our relations? how will this disparage our Doctrine, and make others suspect the comforts which we reach forth to them upon like oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions? <hi>Thy words have upholden him that was fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees; but now it is come upon thee and thou faintest; it touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thee and thou art troubled,</hi> Job 4.4, 5.</p>
            <p>To comfort others and faint our selves, is to bring a discredit upon what we propound to them. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the glory of God is concerned in your beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour under this tryal, and the honor of your Ministry. Let your Christian friends know there is a reality in what you have held forth for their support in like case. Let them see you make it your care to practise your own Doctrine. We are <hi>set forth for signes.</hi> Gods eys and mens are upon us; do worthily and becoming your station.</p>
            <p>Its true, God comes neer when he separates those that are so neer and dear one to another; and we ought to lay it to heart; but that wherin you are like to err, is in too much sorrow and dejection of spirit; which may be your wisdom to labour to prevent, as being seemly for a Christian and a Preacher, to shew his moderation. We finde that <hi>Abraham</hi> mourned for <hi>Sarah</hi>; and he had great cause so to do, for she was a very good companion to him in all his travels
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:47527:18"/>
and troubles; she was very pleasing in his eye, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of her beauty; she brought him a child in his old age, the son of the promise; she is honored in Scripture above all other women of her age; the time how long she lived is set down, which is not done for any other woman. At her death <hi>Abraham</hi> mourns; but very moderately; he wept for her, but we finde no excess in the measure or in the time of his grief; and he is a good pattern. <hi>David</hi> weeps for the death of his child while it was alive; for he fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it would dye; and the thing he feared came upon him: but when they thought that upon the death of his child his tears would have risen to a flood, it was suddenly a low ebb, and he gives herein instruction to all mourners, and to you, teaching you to say <hi>wherefore should I now fast and weep any longer? I cannot bring her back again: I shall go to her, but she shall return to me</hi>; and plainly asserts that none should mourn more then they can give a good reason for, <hi>why should I now mourn</hi>? you know its no other then we ought dayly to expect and look for here below, vicissitudes name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and changes. And you will soon meet her again in heaven, where (as I conceive with <hi>Austin</hi>) she shall be <hi>Notissima tibi.</hi> And in the mean time, in your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying Christ you injoy her still in him; And all the helps, advantages, sweetnesses, counsels, consolations satisfactions, defences, carings, cordials, contentments, whatever was lovely in her, whatever you loved her for, you still injoy in him, either by the administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of other mediums, or immediately from himself; and what comes from God immediately, is much sweeter. You have cause rather to be thankful you enjoyed her so long, then sorrowful you can on earth enjoy her no longer. I know not whether her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:47527:19"/>
worth and holiness will serve more to <hi>aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate your loss,</hi> or to <hi>allay your sorrow.</hi> 'Tis sad to think you have lost such a loving, humble, godly and meet companion. But remember that <hi>Because</hi> she was such an one, you have the more confidence that she is <hi>blessed,</hi> and is gone from you to better company; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the company of Saints free from all sin, and all sorrow; full of holiness and happiness, of Angels too, of Jesus Christ too; the King of Saints, the Lord of Angels, he that so loved us; he that did so much, suffered so much for us; he whom the fathers before his incarnation so longed to see<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he whom e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very believing soul so pants and breaths after. Which that it may the more sensibly appear, I shall here take occasion to subjoyn her just and true Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</p>

               </head>
               <p>SHe was a Gentlewoman born, of the house of the <hi>Wintringhams,</hi> a family of eminency and note in <hi>York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire</hi>; Educated and trained up from her childhood, till married, under Dr. <hi>Chaderton,</hi> Master of <hi>Emanuel</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> that famous godly man, and her neer Kinsman; by reason whereof she was even in her yonger yeers so grounded in knowledge, season'd with Grace, and accomplish'd with abiliments and endowments every way, that she was a most rare and incomparable companion for a Minister.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Some things there were, wherein she was exceeding ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary.</hi> As she was a woman of a marvellous humble spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; That all who knew her and conversed with her, admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in her; and it was abundantly evident and apparent in her countenance, speeches, gestures, apparel, and every way.</p>
               <p>A simple, single, plain-hearted woman. <hi>An Israelite in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, in whom there was no guile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A merciful, pitiful, charitable woman. Open hearted, open-handed too, to her power; yea, and beyond her power: spared it from her own back and belly to cloath and feed others; gladly embraced occasions when offered; yea, gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily sought out occasions. Her love was not verbal onely, such as that <hi>James</hi> speaks of, <hi>Go and be cloathed, go and be warmed,</hi> &amp;c. But real, she refreshed the bowels of many. The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon her, and she made the widows heart to sing for joy. When the <hi>Scots</hi> were shut up and starved by thousands at <hi>Westminster,</hi> she very frequently visited them, and ministred to them. Yea, bought divers of them with her own mony, gracious good men, whom she fed and cloathed, and disposed of into families and ways wherein they live to this day very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:47527:20"/>
When the Scotch Ministers and others were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der restraint in the Tower, she <hi>was not ashamed of their chain,</hi> but <hi>diligently sought them out,</hi> as soon as she heard of them, and was all the time of their long confinement a great support and comfort to them; she had not onely learned the Heathens lesson <hi>to lay up,</hi> but the Christians lesson too, to <hi>lay out</hi> according as the necessities of the poor members of Jesus Christ called for it.</p>
               <p>A true Mourner. One that laid to heart, and was affected, deeply affected with the sins and abominations of the times; with the miseries likewise and distresses of the Church and people of God, made the Churches sorrows her own sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows; had bowels of compassion in her to lament and mourn over the afflicted condition of the Church, as if it were her own condition. <hi>Remembred them in bonds, as bound with them, and them that suffered adversity, as being her self also in the body.</hi> The heart breaking miseries of poor <hi>Scotland,</hi> broke her heart. She could not speak of them without many tears.</p>
               <p>A fixed, established, grounded Christian: Not like those the Apostle speaks of, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.14. That were <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, like Clouds in the Air, or like Ships on the Sea, toss'd and hurried up and down with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very wind and wave, driven to and fro, this way and that way; but like a house built upon a Rock, like a tree firmly rooted, a fixed Star; no wandring Star (wandring from one opinion to another, and from one way to another, but a fixed Star) kept to her old Principles, and to her old practises, <hi>the good old way,</hi> the way that the Patriarchs and the Prophets, and the Apostles, and the <hi>holy men and women in the old time</hi> (1 Pet. 3.5.) went to Heaven in, the way of sanctifying Gods Sabbaths, the way of fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting publique Ordinances, the way of performing Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily and Closet-duties, the way of reading the Scriptures,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:47527:20"/>
Meditation, Self-examination, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And for the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, she received it constantly, as oft as it was administred in the Congregation whereof she was; never miss'd once.</p>
               <p>One that filled up her relations to the very utmost that it is almost possible to do. One that did abound in love to God, to his Ways, Ordinances, Truths, People. <hi>Hereby shall all men know that you are my Disciples, if you love one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,</hi> says Christ. And this Evidence she had in visible Characters; wherever she saw <hi>Aliquod Christi,</hi> as <hi>Luther</hi> speaks, there her love was fixed; were it in Rags, or Robes; poor, or rich, all one for that. All that were dear to God, were dear to her soul.</p>
               <p>No wanderer from house to house, and idle squanderer away of her precious time, in complemental visits. Had learned to <hi>keep at home</hi>; and that's the duty, the wisdom, the honor too of a woman. <hi>Sarah</hi> was found in <hi>her Tent</hi> still; and <hi>Jael</hi> in <hi>her Tent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This I mention, Because she was much blamed by many for not going to Christenings and Burials, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as if she did it out of Pride and Self-conceitedness, and contempt and disdain of others, or out of a sullen retiredness and affected privacy; whereas she did it out of meer conscienciousness of her duty. And she had many reasons why she did it, as partly because her eldest daughter dying in Child-bed, she and her child both, about eight yeers since, she found that such meetings renewed upon her afresh the remembrance of that very great loss. Partly because she saw so much gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry and bravery in apparel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> at such meetings, as did not a little trouble her. But especially because she saw it to be so much a waster of much precious time, which she knew how to make a better improvement of.</p>
               <p>What shall I say? In a word, she was a pattern of Mortification; of Self-denyal; of contempt of the world;
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:47527:21"/>
of strictness and holiness, and close walking with God, both in her general and particular calling, to all that were about her while she lived.</p>
               <p>And in the time of her sickness — so patient, so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, so willing to be at Gods dispose either for life or death, so fearful lest there should be so much as in her heart, any the least risings against Gods dispensations; so full of sweet, holy, heavenly instructions, exhortations, counsels to her husband, to her children, to her friends, her lips were like a Well of Life, feeding many, as <hi>Solomon</hi> speaks, dropping like a Hony-comb.</p>
               <p>I might enlarge. But shall conclude all with that of our Saviour (<hi>John</hi> 14.28.) when his disciples sate blubber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and weeping, and taking on, because he had told them he must now leave them in regard of his bodily presence and go to Heaven, go to his father, <hi>If you loved me</hi> (saith he) <hi>if you loved me, you would rejoyce, because I go to the Father.</hi> Oh how well it were if you could do so! And do it! You say you loved her, shew it; and shew it in this way, shew it in rejoycing rather then in mourning.

The Family, the City, the Nation, the whole World indeed has a loss: Good Men and good Women; such as have an interest in God, and a heart to improve that interest, as they are a publike good whilst they live, so their loss is a publike loss when they dye.
