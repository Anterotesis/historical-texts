            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>SUch a Cloud of <hi>Duſt</hi> has riſen up amongſt us by the Tumultuous <hi>Courſes</hi> of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant men, <hi>Running</hi> from the Orders of Our Church concerning things <hi>Indifferent</hi> (which themſelves are ſometimes pleas'd to call <hi>ſhadows,</hi> and <hi>Circumſtances</hi>) that we can hardly diſcern the great Danger we are fallen into of becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Guilty of a baſe Connivence to ſome Publick, and moſt <hi>Contagious</hi> Impieties, which are as it were eſtabliſhed by a Law; I mean, are Obtruded upon us with ſuch Confidence, as if there were nothing in the Laws of Our Church, or State to Oppugn and Suppreſs them: I ſhall Inſtance only in the Reprinting of ſeveral Verſes of Mr. <hi>COWLEY'S</hi> (ſince his Death) ſome
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:104196:3"/>
of them ſo Notoriouſly <hi>Laſcivious,</hi> others ſo <hi>Profane,</hi> that it cannot be eaſily imagin'd how the <hi>DEVIL</hi> could be more Gratify'd in any thing, then in the Plauſible recommendation of them to the Sprightly Youths, and Preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Wits of this Nation. In Oppoſition to the Black Attempt of the Publiſher of them, I ſhall here firſt Recite my Thoughts of them, which I Publiſht in a certain Epiſtle about eleven years ſince: And then I ſhall make ſome Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverſions on what has been Written of late in the Defence of theſe <hi>Artifices</hi> of Baſeneſs, and Impurity, for which I truſt Mr. <hi>COWLEY</hi> was truly <hi>Penitent.</hi> For when He Dy'd He En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join'd the Perſon, whom Before <hi>GOD,</hi> and His Holy Angels I now Charge with the Guilt of this Impurity, <hi>to reviſe his Works, and to blot out whatſoever might ſeem the leaſt offence to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, or good Manners.</hi> The words in the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle above mention'd are theſe:
<q>
                  <hi>And now</hi> Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if thou beeſt a <hi>CHRISTIAN</hi> indeed, I ſhall intreat thee by all the Love that thou ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to Him that was <hi>CRUCIFIED</hi> for thy ſake, that thou wouldeſt Oppoſe with all thy Might, that Vain Spirit of <hi>Fooliſh Talking,</hi> and <hi>Writing,</hi> which is gone abroad into the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:104196:3"/>
World to the great Diſhonour of <hi>HIS</hi> Name, who has told us that we ſhall give an Account of <hi>Every Idle Word.</hi> And here I cannot but Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim aloud againſt ſome of Mr. <hi>COWLEY'S</hi> Verſes; particularly that part of his Book, which he entitles <hi>The Miſtreſs,</hi> in which there are ſeveral Expreſſions ſo provoking to <hi>Speculative Luſt, and Uncleanneſs,</hi> that I can't conceive how a <hi>CHRISTIAN</hi> that caſts his Eye on them, can think otherwiſe, then that the Author did either Forget that There is a <hi>GOD,</hi> or that 'tis <hi>Sinful</hi> to be <hi>Laſcivious.</hi> What <hi>Prophaneneſs</hi> alſo is this Author guilty of, who uſes theſe Sacred Words, <hi>HEAVEN, DEITY, DIVINE PRESENCE, FAITH,</hi> &amp;c. to ſet forth his <hi>Diſſolute</hi> Amorous Conceptions! (I ſhould rather have ſaid <hi>Wanton,</hi> or <hi>Laſcivious, Amorous</hi> being too gentle a term) Let any man of Common Reaſon judge whether the Minds of any Readers Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly Inclin'd (and ſuch ſurely are all thoſe that Delight in thoſe <hi>POEMS</hi>) be not as apt to be wholly <hi>Debauch't</hi> and <hi>Corrupted</hi> by a Work of this Nature, as thoſe mens <hi>Bodies</hi> are to <hi>take Infection,</hi> when they are amongſt <hi>Sick Folk,</hi> who are already <hi>diſpos'd</hi> to the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe.</hi>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:104196:4"/>
Alas! Alas! Are not men apt enough of themſelves to be <hi>Vain</hi> in their <hi>Imaginations</hi>! Muſt the <hi>Froth,</hi> and <hi>Vanity</hi> of Wanton Minds be <hi>wrought up,</hi> and increaſed by the Wit, and Studies of ſuch Learned Perſons, and thoſe owning the Name of <hi>CHRISTIANS! O Tempora! O Mores!</hi>
               </q>
I deſire the Reader would take Notice, that This was Publiſht in the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natick</hi> Times, after Mr. <hi>COWLEY'S</hi> Book (as I was credibly inform'd) had been Publickly Commended without Exception by an Eminent Perſon then in <hi>Oxford.</hi> And now let us ſee what the <hi>Apologiſt</hi> can ſay for the things I ſo much Abhor.</p>
            <p>
               <q>If there needed any excuſe to be made that his Love-Verſes ſhould take up ſo great a ſhare in his Works, it may be alledg'd that they were compos'd, when he was very young. But it is a vain thing to make any kind of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology for that ſort of Writings. If Devout, or Virtuous Men will ſuperciliouſly forbid the minds of the young, to adorn thoſe ſubjects about which they are moſt converſant: They would put them out of all capacity of perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming graver matters, when they come to them. For the Exerciſes of all Mens Wits, muſt be
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:104196:4"/>
always proper for their Age, and never too much above it: And by practice, and uſe in lighter Arguments, they grow up at laſt to excel in the moſt weighty. I am not therefore aſham'd to commend Mr. <hi>Cowley's</hi> Miſtreſs. I only except one or two Expreſſions, which I wiſh I could have prevail'd with thoſe that had the right of the other Edition to have left out. But of all the reſt I dare boldly pronounce that never yet ſo much was written on a Subject ſo Delicate, that can leſs offend the ſevereſt rules of Morality. The whole Paſſion of Love is intimately deſcrib'd, with all its mighty Train of Hopes, and Joys, and Diſquiets. Beſides this amorous tenderneſs, I know not how in every Copy there is ſomething of more uſeful Knowledge very naturally, and grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully inſinuated, and every where there may be ſomething found, to inform the minds of wiſe Men, as well as to move the hearts of young Men or Women.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Author of this Empty Rhetorick muſt not be Over-Angry if I tell him that it puts me in mind of a far greater piece of Wit (and that Accompanied with <hi>Honeſty</hi>) deliver'd by an <hi>Heathen Poet</hi>:

               </q>
A Fine Colour for a <hi>Laſcivious</hi> Poem, this, An Intimate Deſcription of the whole Paſſion of Love! But what does the man Intend? Is he in good earneſt of this Opinion, that 'tis Requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite that thoſe Ingenious Young men, that are much addicted to <hi>Venery,</hi> ſhould Exerciſe their <hi>Phanſies</hi> in Compoſing the moſt Accurate Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of the Pleaſures they take in the <hi>Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> only or in the Groſſeſt Acts of <hi>Carnality</hi>; And that for this reaſon, that their <hi>Phanſies</hi> ſo Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercis'd in their Youth will make them the better <hi>Poets,</hi> or <hi>Rhetoricians,</hi> when they come to a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Age? <hi>It may be alledg'd,</hi> ſaies He, <hi>that they were compos'd when he was very young.</hi> But by Publiſhing them ſo many years after, He gave the World a ſad Inſtance of that Saying, <hi>Quo ſemel eſt imbuta recens,</hi> &amp;c. If He had Obſerv'd the Inſtruction of the <hi>Wiſe Man, Remember thy Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor in the daies of thy youth,</hi> He would certainly even in thoſe Daies have Apply'd his Mind to things Pleaſing in His Sight, VVho tells us that we ſhall <hi>give Account in the Day of Judgment of every Idle Word.</hi>

               <hi>It is a vain thing,</hi> &amp;c.

            <p>
               <hi>If Devout, or Virtuous Men will ſuperciliouſly forbid,</hi> &amp;c. Since no Devout or Virtuous Men, as Such, can do any thing Superciliouſly, whether this paſſage be not moſt notoriouſly Fooliſh and Impertinent, let any one judg, who is himſelf a Perſon of True Honour and Virtue.</p>

out of Mr. <hi>Henry Vaughans</hi> Preface to his Book entitled <hi>Silex Scintillans: SACRED PO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>EMS,</hi> and private <hi>EJACULATIONS.</hi> A large Encomium of this excellent Gentleman I find amongſt the Poems of the incomparable Mrs. <hi>Katherine Philips,</hi> (who I preſume) by her acquaintance with Mr. <hi>COWLEY</hi> was the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of the great and good <hi>GOD</hi> to excite him to that ſenſe of Piety, which he diſcover'd in that deſire above mentioned, that his works ſhould be revis'd, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> O that he had liv'd to have blotted out thoſe naughty things (particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly his wicked <hi>Encomium</hi> of that <hi>diſgrace</hi> of Our Nation, that deteſtable <hi>Apostate,</hi> that <hi>LE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIATHAN Infidel</hi>) and to have teſtifi'd his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance with his own Pen!

            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Vaughans</hi> Repentance for the like Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies is by himſelf largely declar'd in theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words:</p>
            <q>
               <p>Well it were for them, (the Authors of idle Poems<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) if thoſe willingly ſtudied, and wilfully publiſhed vanities could defile no ſpirits but their own; but the caſe is far worſe. Theſe <hi>Vipers ſurvive</hi> their <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,</hi> and for many ages after (like <hi>Epidemic</hi>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:104196:8"/>
Diſeaſes) infect whole Generations, corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alwaies and unhallowing the beſt-gifted <hi>ſouls,</hi> and the moſt capable <hi>Veſſels</hi>: for whoſe Sanctification, and well-fare the glorious Son of <hi>GOD</hi> laid down his <hi>life,</hi> and ſuffer'd the pretious <hi>blood</hi> of his bleſſed, and innocent <hi>heart</hi> to be poured out.</p>
               <p>A <hi>good</hi> wit in a <hi>bad</hi> ſubject is (as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaid of the <hi>fair</hi> and <hi>fooliſh woman) like a Jewel of gold in a ſwines ſnout, Prov.</hi> 11.22. Nay the more acute the <hi>Author is,</hi> there is ſo much the more danger, and death in the <hi>work.</hi> Where the Sun is buſie upon a <hi>Dunghil,</hi> the <hi>iſſue</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies ſome unclean Vermine.</p>
               <p>And here becauſe I would prevent a juſt <hi>cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> by my free <hi>confeſsion,</hi> I muſt remember that I my ſelf have for many years together langui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed of this very <hi>ſickneſs</hi>; and it is no long time ſince I have recover'd. But bleſſed be <hi>GOD</hi> for it! I have by his ſaving aſſiſtance ſuppreſſed my <hi>greateſt follies,</hi> and thoſe which eſcaped from me are (I think) as innoxious, as moſt of that <hi>vein</hi> uſe to be; beſides they are interlin'd with many virtuous, and ſome pious mixtures. What I ſpeak of them is truth, but let no man miſtake it for an <hi>extenuation</hi> of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:104196:9"/>
faults, as if I intended an <hi>Apology</hi> for them, or my ſelf, who am conſcious of ſo much <hi>guilt</hi> in <hi>both,</hi> as can never be expiated with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>ſpecial ſorrows,</hi> and that cleanſing, and pretious effuſion of my Almighty Redeemer: and if the world will be ſo charitable as to grant my requeſt, I do here moſt humbly, and earneſtly beg that none would read them.</p>
               <p>But an idle or ſenſual <hi>ſubject</hi> is not all the poyſon in theſe Pamphlets. Certain Authors have been ſo irreverently bold, as to daſh <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,</hi> and the <hi>ſacred Relatives of God</hi> with their impious conceits; And (which I cannot ſpeak without grief of heart) ſome of thoſe deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate <hi>adventurers</hi> may (I think) be reckon'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the principal, or moſt learned writers of <hi>Engliſh Verſe.</hi>

               <p>The ſuppreſſion of this pleaſing and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing <hi>evil,</hi> lies not altogether in the power of the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi>; for it will fly abroad in <hi>Manuſcripts,</hi> when it fails of entertainment at the <hi>Preſs.</hi> The remedy lies wholly in their boſomes, who are the gifted perſons, by a wiſe exchange of <hi>vain</hi> and <hi>vitious ſubjects for divine Themes, and Celeſtial Praiſe.</hi> The <hi>perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance</hi> is eaſie, and were it the moſt difficult in
