            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> present vnto your censure this tract of
<hi>Monsieur Cameron</hi> in English; I know
the skill of many for translating out of
French to bee farre better then mine
owne: but my request is, that you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
my desire to do good, and not my imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
I hold it a matter altogether impossible to draw
a picture fully to the life: let Poets tell of painters,
and of birds deceiued by the exactnesse of their
skill; yet an originall ever looseth some lustre and
grace, though the translatours care be never so great.
Howsoever consider I intreate you, the author of
this little tract: for the worke of any man is now<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adayes
esteemed, as the workeman is, and men care
most for reading that whose authours they esteeme.
For the Author I will say this little: during his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
life his reputation was great in <hi>France,</hi> and so
great, that all the Iesuites there did seeke, and at last
obtained to haue him banished, nor was there any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cause thereof then his great learning,<note place="margin">Plantus <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

him.</p>

            <p>He had his refuge here, where by the speciall care of
that great fauourer of learning <hi>K. Iames</hi> (of blessed
memory) he was provided for in <hi>Scotland,</hi> his natiue
cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try, but so great was his harty loue to <hi>France,</hi> that
by the effectual mediatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of those honorable Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors
then in <hi>France,</hi> he gat that envious sentence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed,


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:7919:4"/>
which being done he immediately conveigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himselfe to Montauban to bee professour there,
where he ended his dayes, to the great losse of Gods
Church, and that Vniversity. Now seeing the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent
loue that hee had in doing good to my owne
natiue Country, I haue endeauoured (as much as ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in mee) to requite his loue, and to make his
French worke speake English. If this tract bee fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
receiued, and that I shall perceiue my English
phrase tollerably to be approued, your kind accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
shall encourage mee to a greater worke: my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
abhorreth idlenesse, and beeing in such a place,

to be worse imployed*.<note place="margin">Quem diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus non inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit occupatum ipse occupat.</note> Enjoy this as <hi>a prodromus,</hi>

in yeares, but in craft and subtility already

when one had told him that hee was busie
making vp the accounts which hee was
to giue of his office; immediately replyed, it
was better for <hi>Pericles</hi> to busie himselfe, in seeking the
meanes how hee might giue no accounts at all, and so
went his wayes. This passage hath beene applauded by
many as most sharpe and witty. But there are some, and
of those not a few who much esteeme the vse and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of the councell it importeth: All bankrupts, pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifoggers,
extortioners, and in a word, the whole

vnto it, as to the onely soveraigne remedie of their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire:

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:7919:5"/>
that knoweth that hee shall come short of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts,
and in the proofe of his pretended right, it is his
safest and easiest way to avoid the comming to any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
or triall at all. Where contrariwise, hee that hath
a cleare conscience, his reckonings ready, his cause good,
doth flye nothing more then such shifts; and desires, and
endeauours aboue all to bee heard throughly, fearing least
the prescription, exceptions, and pretences of cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
wranglers, though hee could make vse of them,
should darken the equitie of his cause, and leaue
behind it this scruple, that his cause in the issue of
it, will prooue like to those other vnto which it
hath some resemblance in the proceeding. Would
to GOD all men in the controversies of religion,
were of the same opinion, and had the same cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
and true meaning, which humaine and civill
wisdome doth suggest to vs in our law suites, that
wee would bee willing to come to an issue. And
since wee all agree that our heauenly Father hath not
left vs without a Testament, that wee on both sides,
know by what Notaries it hath beene receiued, where
they haue enrolled it, since wee haue the law and the
testimony, that wee would also haue our recourse with
a joynt consent, to that Testament, to those Notaries, to
their Registers, and say with one and the same voyce af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Prophet, <hi>To the law and to the testimony, if they
speake not according to this word, it is because there is no light

            </p>
            <p>Truely God revealeth not his will; the Prophets, the
Apostles teach it not, but by his word; wee haue this word,
what can wee aske more? would wee know what the
judgement of God is, what the testimony of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
and Apostles are concerning that doctrine? ought
not God himselfe to declare it? should not the Prophets
and Apostles Publish it? Wee haue this declaration, wee

we seeke, and aske so earnestly, to wit a sentence and a finall

that the King, the Secretary, the Court, the Register bee
all present wheresoever it is requisite that the Kings will
be knowne, if wee haue the order of the Court, wee are as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
of the Edict and decree. Wee stand at this day on
these termes, wee haue not to do with the Iewes, neither
with the Turkes, who denie the authority, the one of a

wee beleeue, wee all protest that we haue in the Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall

the like before the congregation, when they endeavoured

there will be no neede of changing any thing therein,

            <p>Since then wee are brought to this poynt, that instead
of pleading the cause throughly, there is a question made
whether wee ought to come so farre, they stand much vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the quality of the accuser, they conteste against the

this manner of proceeding.</p>
            <p>And first as touching the quality of the accusers, they
terme them new start-vps, they aske them what calling
they haue thereunto, by what authority they haue made so
bold an attempt as to protest they desire the reformation
of the Church.</p>
            <p>The thing then objected to them is <hi>noveltie and rashnesse.</hi>
But both of these objections are but a recrimination, the
which cannot be verified, but that first their accusation be
convinced of vntruth, and therefore ought not, neither can it
be receiued, before that point of their accusation be cleared.</p>
            <p>They vndertake to proue that the doctrine of our Lord
and of the Apostles hath beene altered and changed in that
Church which termeth it selfe Catholique: they vrge that
every other doctrine is to be rejected, no other admitted
but that alone. They protest then, not that they will bring
in, but that their meaning is to banish novelties, for which
cause <hi>Noveltie,</hi> cannot bee obiected vnto them, so long as it
cannot be proved that they are innovatours: which is the
chiefe point of the controversie: the question beeing not
here of the <hi>Nouelty</hi> of the persons but of that of faith and
doctrine, <hi>according to which we ought to iudge of the persons,
and not of it according to the persons.</hi>

            <p>Seing then that the summe of their accusations consist, in
this that they accuse the Church, falsely called Catholique,
to haue innovated, so long as it doth not appeare, whether
their accusation be true or no, <hi>novelty</hi> cannot be obiected
to them. As for the <hi>rashnesse</hi> of the accusation, no more
can it be obiected vnto them, vntill that the accusation bee
retorted by a direct and just defence: for even as in an estate

are not punished, if their accusation be not found false;
but if it be true they are applauded, rewarded, advanced, and
often promoted in the offices, and places of the accused. In
the Church of God, in matter of conscience wee ought not
to stoppe any mans mouth, but to convince, or satisfie the
heart and conscience; such was the practise of the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall

vpon the Scripture, but wrested according as they listed,
some certaine peeces of it, forcing them to their purpose,

now God speaking in the Scripture, is as though hee did

intelligible, &amp; this writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> word is obscure as much as may be.</p>
            <p>3 Thirdly, the Scripture is ambiguous and subject to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers

            <p>5 Fiftly, the resolution of a Iudge ought to make them

            <p>1 And as for the first, if <hi>God speaking in the Scriptures, or

that the Scripture is dombe, and giuing no sound, ought wee
not vpon the same reason to say that the Fathers speaking
in their writings, the Church speaking in the Cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the
Councells, the Pope in his decrees, and decretalls, in his

            <p>This first reason then drawne from the nature of the

that all the proofes drawne from this word are likewise
obscure and consequently that the Romish Religion cannot
be gathered from the Scripture, but by guesses and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectures:
So that all the proofes drawn from this Scripture,
to maintaine the Doctrine of the Romish Church, shall be
meere coniectures and guesses: And are they not to blame
then vpon this reckoning, not to bind those that accuse the
Romish Church of reuolt, to keepe themselues to the iudge
before whom they haue made their appeale? seing hee
speakes so obscurely on the accusers side, that hee will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

who being in possession, whereas the accuser is the

themselues either vpon the circumstances of the very text,

and not simply vpon the authority of the Church?</p>
            <p>If the Scripture be as they say, <hi>a nose of waxe, Theramenes

the winde:</hi> wherefore do they refute by Scripture the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations,
nay, rather the false glosses of heretiques?
Wherefore do they not barely alleage vnto them the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Church? Verily according to their reckoning,

more vrge the words of the Scripture, <hi>hoc est corpus meum,</hi>

being a part of the Scripture, is according to the nature of

of divers interpretations:</hi> and therefore they ought not
to beleiue transubstantiation by reason of this place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but because it hath pleased the Church so to interpret
it: and so the beliefe of the Church of Rome will not bee
grounded vpon the Scripture, nor ruled according to it;
but quite contrary, the sence of the Scripture, is ruled and
grounded vpon the knowledge of the Church; so that the
foundation is builded vpon the house, and the building is
the levell and the square.</p>
            <p>And to conclude, how commeth it to passe that they say

that the Scripture proueth so distinctly, so clearely, so evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently

which is called Catholique, vndertaken to proue all the

they shew themselues in this sophisters and cavilling di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputers,
seeking in the Scripture that which is not there to

points of doctrine beleeued in the Church termed Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique,
which are not contained in the Scripture? who
amongst them all dare vndertake to make a catalogue of
any such points? what may those points of doctrine be, that
are not handled in the Scripture, for being silent in which,
the Scripture is termed imperfect?</p>
            <p>They are not points touching the Trinity, the incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

necessity and practise of good workes, of life eternall, of
Baptisme, of the preaching of the word, of the holy supper;
these points and those that depend on them are without
doubt retained in the Scripture.</p>
            <p>What then can these articles of faith bee, of which the
Prophets, the Apostles, nay God himselfe hath spoken in
the Scripture? Is it the article of the popes authority,
not only now to excommunitate, but also to depose Kings?
his authority of dispe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cing with mariages, with which God

that (according to the allegation) it cannot bee knowne who

            <p>The fourth accusation <hi>of the imperfection of the Scripture</hi>

promisse this <hi>so exact and perfect doctrine,</hi> either its witnesse
is not of God, or what it testifies of it selfe is true. Nay
which is more, God hath expressely prohibited to adde to
it, or to diminish any thing from it. And if this hath had
place in the old Testament, shall it not in the new which is
much more full and perfect? it is not to bee beleeued. Let vs

            <p>TOuching the fift allegation that the Scripture cannot be
the rule, seeing <hi>it cannot put an end to the dissentions of
them, who make profession to keepe themselues strictly vnto it,</hi>
is also wonderfully perverse. For question is not made of
such a rule, as vnto which, all those should truly and indeed
conforme themselues, who make a shew so to do, neither
of finding such a Iudge, as all they who professe to yeeld, &amp;
referre themselues to his judgement, should in effect per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
it: so long as the Church shall be militant here on
earth, such a rule, such a Iudge will not be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. But the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
is of finding a rule, of finding a Iudge, to whom who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever

himselfe, shall not disagree fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> those who do the like?


<pb n="30" facs="tcp:7919:16"/>
Otherwise albeit that passion, and malice hinder not that
men may seeme to hold themselues to one certaine rule, of
which the doctrine is evident and playne, for to disguise the
businesse and colour over a bad cause these vices notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
will not suffer vs in truth to conforme our selues
thereunto, as is seene in the example of the heretiques aboue
alleaged, who did protest to keepe themselues to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
of Nice, and to the traditions of the Fathers. Moreover
we do not seeke a rule to which whosoever conformeth
himselfe doth it wholy in all points. For it is well knowne
that the Fathers did conforme themselues to the patterne
of the Scripture, to the consent of the Church, and yet
which of them hath done it so exactly? all of them by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of humaine infirmity, disagreing one with another, and
oftentimes from themselues. He that shall say, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God speaking in the scripture is not Iudge, by the same
reason should bee forced to conclude, that neither the
Church it selfe is Iudge. But the question is of finding a
Iudge, a rule which might cause agrement at least in the
Principall points, amongst all those who sincerely desire the
knowledge of truth.</p>
            <p>There were betwixt the Christians and the Iewes great

lay claime to the Scripture, it is not in effect and indeede
but only in shew. and therefore as those who make some
false Demonstrations in the Mathematicks, although they

refuted and convinced by the same principles, and therefore
their errour is no ways preiudicious to the authority and

for to cloake their heresie, they teere in peeces the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and wrest it to their sence, ought neverthelesse to bee
convinced, no otherwise, then by the same Scriptures of
which the Lord hath left vnto vs a notable example in his
person, when being tempted by Satan who applyed and vsed
against him the scripture, he repelled the temptation by the
same scripture: the holy Fathers also did they leaue of to
beate downe heresie, even so farre as to put it to death, by
this sword of the spirit, albeit that heresie also in shew made
vse of it. Truly the hereticks forge their heresie first in
their heads, and then afterwards seeke it in the Scripture,<note place="margin">Tertul. de resur. car. cap. 3. Vt de Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris solis quaesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ones suas si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant stare non poterunt.</note>

for is it not doubted, nay is it not formally denyed that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Synodes are infallible? Is it not avouched that they

true? And it will availe nothing to reply here, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
was not made to particular Councels, but to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
which are called Oecumenicall. For the Lord hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to be as wel in themid'st of two or three gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in his name, as of a whole multitude. If this promise
hindreth not, but two or three may erre, how shall it oblige
vs to judge better of a multitude? what then the Lord shall


<pb n="33" facs="tcp:7919:17"/>
not hee keepe his promise, and shall not hee bee justified
when hee speakes? nay, let every man be declared a lyer,
that the Lord may be acknowledged faithfull and true: for
hee hath promised not to a multitude only, but also to two
or three the assistance of his spirit in their consultations, to
wit, <hi>if they be gathered together in his name,</hi> if they seeke
him in trueth. But who canne discerne who are they;
if not by the holinesse of their constitutions, which if it be
not found in them, wee are not bound to beleeue that
they were assembled in the name of Christ, nor conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
that they haue beene made pertakers of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of such an excellent promise. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi>
well knew this truth when hee affirmed that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells
even those which are generall may be corrected and
reformed.</p>
            <p>To what good then serue the Councels? truly oftentimes
they are so farre from beeing good, that they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious:
for if the number of those which are good bee
the lesse without doubt the multitude will carry it, and
it will bee as the Councell of the foure hundred Prophets
and one, holden in the presence of <hi>Iehosaphat,</hi> and <hi>Ahab,</hi>
where the 400 evill prophets crushed the one good, and
carried it notwithstanding all the resistance he could make.
For which cause the Religious wisdome of holy <hi>Athanasius</hi>
cannot sufficiently be praised, opposing himselfe against
them, who required Synodes vnder pretence of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming

the Scripture more proper for this purpose then <hi>any

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:7919:18"/>
there is no doubt but such an assembly may bring forth
much good, because it might cleare, that which is difficult,
not by it's owne authority, but by it's sufficiencie. Even as
when a window is opened by a strong dextrous hand,
which was shut vp before; the more weake and vnable who
could not open it, do see the sun, perceiue the opening, not
because of any authority of him that opened it, but by reason
of his strength, &amp; dexterity manifesting it selfe by a visible
and sensible effect. But such Councels we may rather wish
then looke for. The deluge of vices which hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed
Christendome having drawne vpon vs this horrible
judgement. Such was that first Councell of Nice, that tooke
the Scripture onely for the rule and square of it's judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and refused not to submit it selfe to the touchstone
and triall, as S<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Athanasius</hi> witnesseth, proposing to other
Councels, or rather conventicles, the example of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels
modesty to make them blush with shame and confound
their pride.</p>
            <p>And indeed it was a remarkable thing, that the Fathers
protested that they would not vse the authority of the
Councell of Nice against the Arrians, but of the scripture,
vpon which the Councell of Nice is founded, what shall
wee then conclude, but that wee ought to approue of the
good Councells, receiue their ordinances with reverence,
not because they could not erre, but if so they haue not er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and argue in this manner against Heretickes, when mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of right is called in question. <hi>The Councell hath so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
according to the Scripture, therefore it is true:</hi> and not
after this manner. <hi>The Councell hath so concluded, therefore
it is so.</hi> But in matter of fact and touching history, to judge
what is that which is vniversally beleeued and receiued, and
by the greater part, wee may wel conclude from the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of an Oecumenicall Councell, that it is beleeued
and receiued generally: And therefore the Councells also
are good for this purpose to stoppe the mouth of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
who might pretend the consent of the Church, and by
such a protestation giue some scandall to the weaker, which


<pb n="35" facs="tcp:7919:18"/>
by this meanes may easily be taken away.</p>
            <p>Truly if the Councels had thought that their consultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
should be approued, because of their authority simply; &amp;
not much more rather, for the truth of them, and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
with the Scriptures, they had never inserted in
their acts the places of Scripture, the reasons on which they
grounded themselues, they had never framed vs, a man may
say, a verball processe of all that had passed, but they would
haue contented themselues to haue inserted the Canons on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
without any further declaration, but not proceeding af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this manner, they would giue vs a reason of their delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and recommend themselues famous, not by the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpation
of a <hi>soveraigne authority,</hi> but by a declaration and
exposition of the trueth, that so our faith might not bee
grounded vpon humane authority, but vpon that of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
God.</p>
            <p>And truly to what end is the ceremony of laying the bible
vpon the table in a Councell; is it not to declare that it's au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
is ruled by a Law? and as a Iudge in a politicke e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state,
who hath the Princes Law for his rule, ought to judge
according to that law, and is accountable for his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
so are the Councels to determine according to the
Scripture, and are bound to make apparant vnto the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
as much as lyes in them, that they haue judged ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
vnto it: but some may say, Councels at lest are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
Iudges. Bee it so; but wee seeke a Soveraigne
Iudge, a Iudge from whom it is not lawfull to appeale, an
infallible Iudge. This authority, this priviledge cannot bee
giuen to Councels. Wee seeke a Iudge that is alwaies on
bench giving audience, a Iudge to whom wee may at all
times haue recourse, and such Councels cannot bee.</p>

<hi>the vncertainty of humane iudgement canne cause that


<pb n="36" facs="tcp:7919:19"/>
God speaking in the Scripture should not bee fit to be our Iudge,</hi>
since a man cannot know, neither who hath, nor whether

the question is not whether wee canne know immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
or as the Schoole speaketh <hi>à priori,</hi> who hath the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost: but onely who speaketh according to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
which being resolued, by conferring the Scriptures,
with that which is proposed, wee may easily conclude,
if passion and malice darken not the vnderstanding who
proposeth the words of the holy Ghost, and by this
meanes discerne <hi>à posteriori</hi> as they say who hath the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
seeing that in regard of Pastors and Doctors none
preach the word of the spirit but those to whom the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
hath suggested them, how wicked and detestable so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
otherwise they may bee. So that the question is
brought to matter of fact, to witte; who proposeth that
which is contained in the Scripture, which question is
cleared in examining the Doctrine proposed by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
as the proportion of a building is knowne by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
of the square and levell. For example, the Iewes
of Boerea did not directly and <hi>à priori</hi> inquire whether
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> when hee preached vnto them was inspired
of the holy spirit, or no; it had beene an impossible thing
for them, seeing it is the property of God alone to bee
the searcher of hearts. But they made inquirie for all that
whether Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did speake according to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and hauing by conferring of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> doctrine
with the Scriptures, discovered the conformity, and how
they answered the one to the other, they judged truly,
&amp; as indeed it was, to wit, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> spake not of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
but by the holy spirit. Yea the Ancients themselues,
hauing to do with heretickes who made shew to hold the
Scripture for their rule, haue not refused to dispute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a Pagan Iudge, who although by reason of his vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe
hee was not capable to judge whether of two parties


<pb n="37" facs="tcp:7919:19"/>
maintained the truth, pronounced neverthelesse and very
happily which of the two concluded most conformably to
the Scripture, which both the one and the other alleaged
for their purpose, but the same sufficeth vs at this day in
our controversies: for if it be apparant who speake accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Scriptures, no man who maketh profession of
Christianity doubting of the Scripture, the conclusion
will bee plaine and evident, that whosoever hee be, speakes
according to truth, and by the spirit of truth: There is
much difference betweene beleeuing the Principles of
Christian Religion, and judging who teach most confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mably
to those principles. To the first, faith and the il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination
of the holy spirit, are absolutely necessary: for
the second, common sense is sufficient. To beleeue that the
Scripture is true, when it teacheth vs that there is but
one God, that the Father is God, the Sonne God, and
the holy Ghost also, that the Father is not the Sonne nor
the holy Ghost, neither the one nor the other, for this
faith onely is required. But to inferre from thence
that the nature of God is one in number, that the persons
of the Trinity are distinct, yet not divided, that they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
in one and the same nature, for this I say com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
sense alone sufficeth, which cannot deny the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,
the truth of the antecedent once granted, which
without all doubt cannot bee comprehended but by faith.
It is then in vaine to aske who shall judge of the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences,
as if a man hauing learned in a historie how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
companies and how many souldiers in every compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
were in an army, how many troopes of horse, and how
many horsemen in every troope, one should demand who
shall judge whether the number of the souldiers of which
the army did consist be rightly collected fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence: In like
manner if we can proue by the Scripture that, that which
Christ gaue to his disciples, was bread broken, and if wee
proue by the same Scripture that the body of Christ is
not broken in the Eucharist, and that yet much lesse the

bread broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is Christs body, to dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d here who shall judge
whether a man may inferre from hence that the Lord gaue
not vs externally his own body in the Eucharist is all one as
to aske, who hath common sense. Likewise, when the

whom the Lord causeth the day to spring from on high to

            <p>Shall the naturall man by his reason comprehend that he

may bee found who boast, nay who thinke verily they
haue the spirit, and yet are grossely deceiued; how many
haue the spirit, and yet erre oftentimes in their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?
and indeede it is so: but is it not either a strange
perversity, or indiscretio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to inferre from thence that none
can know, that none can judge and discerne assuredly to
salvation, the spirituall things which God hath revealed
outwardly to his by his word, &amp; inwardly by his spirit? For
do we not see amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gst men how many there are who glory
and deceiue themselues with a false opinion of wisdome,
being indeed imprudent &amp; foolish, &amp; yet whosoever would
conclude from thence, that hee who is truly wise, cannot
know that hee is so; should bring into the world not that of


<pb n="40" facs="tcp:7919:21"/>
the Academiques, but even the Pyrronian suspence of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
If then the boasting and vanity of a foole, cannot
prejudice the assured knowledge, which hee who is wise
can, and ought to haue of wisdome; no more can the false
perswasions of hypocrites which proceede from the illusio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of Satan, shake the certainty of that assura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce which procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
from the sense and feeling of the spirit dwelling in
the heart of the spirituall man, and giuing as wee haue said,
testimony to his spirit. Yea the conformity of his moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
with the word of the Scripture, assures and strengthens
him, and putteth a difference betweene the sence and feeling
he hath, and that which ariseth from the false illusion of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
which hath no other rule then it selfe. From the same
fountaine either of malice or vnadvisednesse it proceedes
that vnder pretence that those who haue receiued the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
do erre sometimes, they would conclude, that in that
which is necessary to salvation they cannot passe any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
judgement: for the wisest in the knowledge of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
businesses may offend against the rules of wisdome, and
yet who will deny for all this but they can giue advise and
sure counsell. Wee say, sure, according to the rules of
wisdome: For no man can answere for the event which
is oftentimes contrary to the wisedome of Counsell and
favoureth rash attempts. The learned are ignorant of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things, but not of such without which they cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
that name. As then the prudent differ not from
fooles in this that they never commit any follies, but in
this that their follies are not grosse, are not ordinary, and as
the difference that is between the learned &amp; the ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
in that which is the Principall in the Science which he
professeth. The ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t on the contrary is either ignorant of
all, or knowes very little, and even that little which hee
knowes to speake properly hee knowes not. So the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
that is betweene the man spiritually wise, &amp; him that
is ignorant according to the spirit, it is not in this that the
Spirituall man never, but in that hee erres not grossely and
ordinarily: Not in that hee knowes all, but in that hee


<pb n="41" facs="tcp:7919:21"/>
knowes all that which is necessary in his profession, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
hee that is spiritually foolish and ignorant, erres almost
alwayes, erres ordinarily, is ignorant of that which is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
that he should know for the making of himselfe such as
hee professeth himselfe to bee. And euen as there is a
great disproportion betweene fooles and wisemen in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
course and cariage of their liues; betweene the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and ignorant in the knowledge of good arts, and yet all
the wise in that kind are not equally wise, nor all the learned
equally learned, nay in that very humane and secular wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and learning, there is no one perfectly wise, perfectly
learned: so great is the difference betweene those whom
God hath enlightned with his knowledge, and those whom
the eyes of their vnderstanding the God of this world hath
blinded, and yet there is no one amongst them all, who hath
attained to the highest degree of perfection.</p>
            <p>Wee conclude then, that as those that belong not to the
Lord, cannot assure themselues of his spirit, and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
cannot discerne his word vnto saluation: so all those
that are his, do feele the efficacie of his spirit in their hearts,
euen as they feele and finde in themselues by experience the
vse of reason; and judge by the spirit of spirituall things
proposed in the word, after the same manner as by reason,
they judge of things that canne bee comprehended by it.
It sufficeth vs to haue proued that the faithfull haue an assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and certaine rule in the Scripture.</p>

            <head type="sub">The verifying of the third meanes of nullity against the
allegations.</head>
            <p>And by these reasons wee thinke wee haue made good
the two first meanes of Nullity proposed against the eight
allegations; It remaineth that wee verifie the third, to wit,
<hi>that they tend to the subversion of Christian Religion.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:7919:22"/>
To come then to the point, let vt first of all consider that
their ayme is to proue that a Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can haue no assurance
of his Religion of that which he ought to beleeue, by the
Scripture, because it <hi>is dumbe, obscure, ambiguous, imperfect,
which cannot assure those who depend on it, and may bee allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in favour of heretickes.</hi> If that detestable opinion bee
once engrafted in the heart, as it is set forth and maintained
by word, and writing, what will become I pray you of the
authority of the Church, which is grounded vpon the
Scripture? if the foundation of it be so falty, is it not to bee
feared that the building will sinke? If a Christian cannot,
yea ought not to ground himselfe vpon the Scripture by
reason of these pretended imperfections, with what confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
shall hee ground himselfe vpon the authority of the
Church, which hath no other foundation, then this founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
so imperfect, if the foresaid allegations be true? But if
the one and the other proppe of faith faile, this of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and consequently that of the authority of the Church
grounded on the Scripture, (as of necessity when the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is vndermined, those that leane vpon the wall must fall
together with the wall) what will become of the authority,
of the assurance of Christian Religion? The right of the
Church is called in question, and shee, either as a daughter
produces the scripture, the coppy of the Testament of her
Father, or as a spouse brings forth the Scripture, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tract
of her marriage, and this Testament is fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d dumbe, obscure,
ambiguous, of a double meaning, being not able to cleare
the night of the Church, nay which may bee imployed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
her. In this case what shall bee the foundation?
what the title? what the proofes of the right of the Church?
will they not be found (if we beleeue the allegations) to be
dumbe, ambiguous, obscure, imperfect proofes? and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
shall not the right, instead of being confirmed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
invalide and of no force? And who will not judge
that the Church proceeds not fairely attributing to her self
so great authority, and maintaining it by proofes fo defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue,
or who will beleeue that the same is the true Church,


<pb n="43" facs="tcp:7919:22"/>
the true people of God, who shew a Testament, a coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of God, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tracted with her, which she confesseth to be
set downe in dumbe words, obscure, ambiguous, applyable
to every sense, and which may be produced and vrged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
her selfe?</p>
            <p>How will the Atheists laugh at this? &amp; how, alas! will the
consciences of them bee shaken, that beleeue and receiue
this opinion of the obscurity, ambiguity, and insufficiencie
of the Scriptures?</p>
            <p>Let vs consider in the second place that their ayme is to
cast all Christians into incertainty; striuing to proue by these
allegations that a man in what concernes Religion ought to
mistrust his owne judgement, which being once granted,
how shall a man know whether hee deceiues not himselfe
in beleeving that there is a Church? Here the Scripture
cannot succour or helpe: for it is presupposed that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
afford any certainty: It is laid for a foundation, that a
Christian hearing, reading, meditating on the Scripture
may coozen and deceiue himselfe. Neither can a man in this
straight haue recourse to the testimony of the holy Ghost;
for the allegation presupposeth, that it cannot be knowne
neither who hath, neither whether a man himselfe hath the
holy spirit or no. And as for the authority of the Church,
it cannot bee alleaged, for question may bee made whether
there be any Church at all. As then to him who should doubt
whether there ought to be a Pope in the world, it would
seeme strange &amp; far fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the purpose to alleage the testimony
of the Pope, for to perswade him that there ought to bee
one: Even so when we are to proue, that there is a Church,
it is in vaine to alleage the testimony of the Church. If
then Christian Religion hath no foundation either in the
Scripture, or in the testimony of the holy Ghost, or in the
authority of the Church, as it followeth from the allegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
where shall shee seeke, where shall shee finde where-v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
to vphold her selfe? shall it bee in Philosophie? there
much lesse; for if a Christian man cannot judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there be a Church by the spirit; as not being able to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure


<pb n="44" facs="tcp:7919:23"/>
himselfe whether hee hath the spirit, much lesse able
shall hee be to do it by his reason, which without the spirit
is starke blinde in spirituall things.</p>
            <p>Let vs in the third place consider that in the disputes
touching the markes and notes of the Church, it is questio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
what they are? one is of one opinion, another of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
whence may a certaine knowledge of them bee had?
shall it bee from the Scripture? but the allegation presuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
that it is impossible: shall it bee from the Church? ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the nearer: for it so litle appeares which is the Church,
that it is controversed what are her markes by which she is
knowne.</p>
            <p>Let vs in the fourth place consider, (that grant wee had
found the markes of the Church, according to the allegation
which casts men into incertitude,) it could not be discerned
to what congregation to apply them, amongst so many and
divers assemblies, who challenge them: for it is supposed as
granted according to the allegation, that the Scripture can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
here guide vs, that wee may deceiue our selues in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the choyce: and the testimony of the Church can as
little helpe vs, if first of all it bee not presupposed that it
hath the markes of the Church, which is the point in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion:
for wee seeke in what Church the markes of the
Church are to bee found: and to rely herein vpon the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of the Church doth presuppose that wee know al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
in what Church the markes of the Church are found.</p>
            <p>Let vs in the fift place consider that according to the alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
there is no meanes how a man converted to the
Church, canne bee assured of his Religion: For if hee hath
not beene convinced by lawfull arguments, neither his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
which followed the conviction of his conscience
shall be lawfull. It is very certaine that if the foundation of
his faith who hath beene converted, bee the authority
of the Church, the foundation of his conuersion hath not
beene lawfull. for there was no meanes to perswade him,
that the Church hath any such authority; in alleadging to
him the testimony of the Church. And the allegation of


<pb n="45" facs="tcp:7919:23"/>
Scripture, and of reason according to their supposition, is
not a lawful meanes to resolue the conscience. Having bin
then brought to acknowledge the authority of the Church
founded vpon these arguments, it cannot be but weake and
vnlawfull; and consequently the beleefe of all that hee
hath beleeued, as depending vpon the authority which hee
giveth vnto the Church. And indeede if such a one whom
wee would convert doth question the authority of the
Church, shall we proue vnto him that whereof he doubteth,
by alleaging vnto him that whereof hee maketh likewise
doubt? the argument then of his conuersion to the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
of the Church cannot haue beene the authority of
the Church. If then no man can bee assured of the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his conversion, no more neither can hee bee which is
builded vpon the foundation.</p>
            <p>In the sixt place let vs obserue that the Church which is
called Catholique never speaketh by word of mouth, they
are the particulars that are her Heralds. It may bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
then by what meanes a man may bee assured that
they discharge their place faithfully, since they may erre in
proposing doctrine contrary to the meaning of the Church?
This cannot bee by the Scripture: for according to the alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
truth and falsehood cannot be discerned by it; no, nor
by the testimony of the Church; for he speaketh not but by
particular men, of whom it is doubted whether they haue
faithfully reported the determination of the Church.</p>
            <p>In the Seaventh place let vs consider, that if the authority
of the Church bee the foundation of faith, every one shall
beleeue because his companion hath beleeued: and so chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
religion shall bee made ridiculous: for seeing the
Church is a congregation of persons in which every one
grounds his faith vpon the authority of the whole congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of which they are Members, it will necessarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that every one of them shall beleeue apart because all
haue beleeued together.</p>
            <p>In the eight place let vs weigh this horrible inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that we shall not beleeue the mysteries of the Trinit,


<pb n="46" facs="tcp:7919:24"/>
of the incarnation of the redemption of mankinde, but by
heare-say, because our Ancestours, our Parents, our fellow
burgesses, haue beleeued so; and shall not beleeue that they
haue beene the Church of God, but because they haue left
this testimony of themselues, which the Iewes may vsurpe
with the like appearance of right, if we renounce the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of Scriptures.</p>
            <p>Now haue wee verified this last meanes of Nullity not
to incense any, (God is our witnesse) but to shew if it bee
possible, into what, and how many execrable absurdities
some amongst them vnadvisedly precipitate themselues,
who by the meanes of these allegations endeavour to draw
vs from the judgement of <hi>God speaking in the Scripture,</hi> to
the judgement of men pretending the title of the Church
being most certaine that he who vrged principally this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse,
if wee way be judge of him according to his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
aymed especially to lay the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>datio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Atheisme, not
that his intent was to overthrow the Romish Religion.
He was a French man and a louer of publike peace, hee did
know that so to maintaine it, it behoued that the most wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
and the most approoued Religion was to be maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
We thinke it not strange, that hee should haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
in publike the Romish Religion: from thence hee
had his meanes: But wee are extreamely displeased, that
he durst testifie by his writings his contempt, and litle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of all Religion.</p>
            <p>Furthermore as we haue proved the iniquity of the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which the Doctors who call themselues Catholickes
passe on the Scripture: so wee hope that it will be easie to
see their assigneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of a judge in sending vs to the Church,
is eyther <hi>illusiue or impossible;</hi> illusiue, if by the Church
they vnderstand themselues: for since they are our oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
parties, they cannot bee our judges. <hi>Impossible</hi> if by the
Church they vnderstand the mysticall body of our Lord
Iesus Christ, to whom only notwithstanding the promises
haue beene made; For who canne distinctly point out the
members of that body but hee alone who is the head? And


<pb n="47" facs="tcp:7919:24"/>
who can then assemble them? And if this be impossible, how
shal that Church be the judge which we require? A speaking
Iudge, a well knowe Iudge, to whom all may haue their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
by whom all may bee resolued. And therefore
we persist in our demand that wee may be remitted to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
before that vnsuspected Iudge, and acknowledged of
all parties, to wit, <hi>God speaking in the Scriptures.</hi>

every one of them; his Testament is not as yet necessary. But as
the terrestriall father finding himselfe nere his end, and fearing
that after his death, the bond of peace being broken, contentions

it shal not be needful to go to the graue, but that the Testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t be
