            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE RIGHT HO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, Maister <hi>Thomas Wilson,</hi> Doctor of the Ciuill Lawe, and one of the principall Secretaries, to the Queenes most excellent Maiestie.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>TVllius,</hi> and <hi>Caius Plinius,</hi> wrote that neither <hi>Posie</hi> nor <hi>Rethoricke</hi> seemed sweete or delecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble without the ornament of eloquence Yet an Historie, of whatsoeuer sorte it be written, dooth please and delight: because, men may thereby knowe, the successe of things happened, to the knowledge whereof, the nature of man is bent: yea, the tale of a Plowman, is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time delightfull to the hearer, especiallie when any new thing is discouered.</p>
            <p>And where the stile of this historie in our English tongue is not, nor at the least, I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not polish as learned me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> might require.
<pb facs="tcp:12091:4"/>
Yet the troth and pith of the matter vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in plaine sort shall suffice giuing li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, as much (as in me lieth) to whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer that will take the paines, to write it ouer againe, to beautifie the same, as to him or them shall seeme conuenient: as often times, hath happened among the <hi>Greeke</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> Historiographers and Translators.</p>
            <p>The Author of this woorke, right ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable, was a Gentleman of woorshipful stocke or linage, he was highlie esteemed of the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fift: vnto whose Maiestie, he was sometime <hi>Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie</hi> in his roiall counsel of iustice, and afterward ordained <hi>Auditor</hi> of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts of the reuenues appertaining to his Maiestie in the Prouinces of <hi>Peru</hi> and firme lande.</p>
            <p>This well minded Gentleman, after the writing of this Historie, feared the
<pb facs="tcp:12091:4"/>
publishing hereof for two principall cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: The one, least the discendent of such as had committed things not woorthie of praise, would conceaue some euill oppini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of him: or els the issue of the vertuous and noble sort, would iudge the praise and commendations of their progenitors sufficiently set foorth according to their deserts: In consideration whereof, he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to remembraunce the oppinion of <hi>Horatius,</hi> which was, that no Historie should come to light vntill nine yeares, were fullie past after the action thereof.</p>
            <p>This oppinion liked him not, but rather thought it more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient, that Histories<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

commendation of their Auncestors.</p>
            <p>The Kinge of <hi>Spaine</hi> that now is, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing perused the originall Copie of this Historie, requested mine Author to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish the same in Printe: and in accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of his Maiesties commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t he hath so doone.

            <p>I may at this day, God be praised, bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie write that, where the <hi>Spanish</hi> and <hi>Portingall</hi> Nacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s dare glorie of their discoueries &amp; Nauigacions, with great commendations of their Captaines, <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon Vasco dela Gama, Magalanez, Hernando Cortez: Don Francisco Pisarro, &amp; Don Diego de Almagro.</hi> Now may our most gracious Queen, most iustly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pare withall the Princes of the world, both for discouery &amp; nauigacion.</p>

            <p>He also writeth of many other memorable thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs as also of the customes and ritches of this great Iland, but especially, of a famous temple, which was built in the principall Citie: the walles and roofes wherof, were wainscotted, with plate of golde, siluer, and latton, and other many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities,

            <p>The Ilands wherof the text maketh mencion seemeth to be <hi>Espaniola, Cuba, Iamaica,</hi> and the residew which stande in that Comarke.</p>
            <p>The firme landes, whiche is sayd to stande in frent of the said Ilands: doth appere by reason, to be the same firme land, which now is called after
<pb facs="tcp:12091:8"/>
the same name, and al the other prouinces, wher vnto it is continent: which, beginnynge from the straight of <hi>Magalanez,</hi> doth contayne (runnyng Northward) the lande of <hi>Peru:</hi> the Prouince of <hi>Popayan, Castillia del oro, Beragua, Nicaragua, Gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timalla Nueua Hispania,</hi> the seuen citties, <hi>Florida, Bacallaos:</hi> and the said lande, runneth along from thence Norward, vntill it come to ioygne almost with <hi>Norway</hi>: In the which (without doubt) is more grounde, then as yet throughout all the world is inhabited, or at least was knowen, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the discouery of this countrey. This mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter doth not cause any great dificultie, that the <hi>Romaines</hi> and other nations, which in time past, inioyed the Land of <hi>Spayne,</hi> had not discouered this countrey: It is to be thought, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of those Seas, in those dayes, did disturbe and hinder the Nauigation.</p>
            <p>So that this Lande, may well bee called the firme and continent Land, wherof <hi>Plato</hi> writeth: which doth agree with all the tokens and signes, which hee giueth of the other: cheefely, wherin hee affirmeth, that it lyeth infrent of the South Sea. Then forasmuch as hath beene sayled in our daies, in the sayd South Sea, doth appere, that in respect of the bredth and greatnes of the sayde South Sea, all the <hi>Mediterraneum</hi> Sea, and as much as is knowen of the Occean, vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly called, the Northen Sea, are Riuers in comparison of the other.</p>
            <p>Then all this approued true, the signes, tokens and wordes of <hi>Plato,</hi> do therwith accord: so that
<pb facs="tcp:12091:8"/>
there is no doubt or difficultie in the first passage into <hi>Peru,</hi> of innumerable people, as well from the great Iland <hi>Atlantica,</hi> as also from other I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landes, from which Ilandes they vsed to sayle: and also out of the firme Land, they might passe into <hi>Peru</hi>: And if in this pointe should seeme any difficultie, yet it is to bee credited, that by the South Sea, they had vse and knowledge of Nauigation, by contraction and traficke, which they had with this great Iland, where the text declareth, that they had great aboundance of Shippes, yea, and Roades, and harbors, made by force of hande, for their conseruacion, where nature wanted.</p>
            <p>This is as much as may be gathered, touching this matter, which is not small, for a thing of such antiquitie, without light: cheefely, that in all the Prouinces and Countrey of <hi>Peru,</hi> were founde no kinde of Letters or Writinge, to conserue the remembrance of things past, nor yet the pictures or paynting, which serued in the new <hi>Spayne,</hi> for Letters, sauing only, certayne stringes, of diuerse colours, full of knots: so that by those knots and distance betweene them, was an account kepte amonge that people, but maruailous strange to be vnderstood, as hereafter in this History shalbe declared. Therfore I may saye with <hi>Horatius</hi>:
<q>Si quid nouicti restius istis, candidus imperti: si non vis vtere mecum.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And as concerning the Discouery of this newe countrey, the wordes of <hi>Seneca</hi> doth fit, which he set out in his <hi>Medea</hi> Tragedy.</p>

               <p>So that all which as yet is discouered of <hi>Peru,</hi> is to be vnderstand by two names, that is to say, all the ground betweene the mountaines and the sea, is called plaines: and all the rest is called mountaines. The plaines are drie and the most part sands: for as before is declared, there it neuer rayneth, nor yet hath there bene founde any spring or fountaine, sauing nere the sea side are 4. or 5. aqueys or cesterns, the water wherof is saltish. But the people doe prouide themselues of water of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers which descend out of the mountaines. The cause of those riuers is the thawing of the snow and rayne which commeth from the sayd hilles where very fewe naturall springes are found: These riuers are distant one from another, some 10. and some 15. and 20, leagues: but the most ordinarie are of seuen and eight leagues: so that commonly the trauelers doo appointe their iorneys accordingly, to come vnto their fresh water. Some of these riuers are a league broade, and some lesse, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the disposition of the ground. Along those Riuer sides are faire prospectes of trees and fruites, &amp; ground conuenient for the Indians to sowe their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>These Indians dwell not in houses, but their abidyng is vnder Trées, and shadowes made for the purpose. Their women were garments made of Cotton woll, like vnto gownes which come downe to their féete.

               <p>ALthough the principal intent of this Historie, was to set out the things hapned to the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards which at that time conquered the land, and of their discouery since.

Therefore I will recite in briefe the estate which the Spaniards found the countrey in at their arriual.</p>
               <p>After that <hi>Guaynacaua</hi> had brought into subiection to great a number of Prouinces to his Empire, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> space of 500.

his Sonnes and Daughters, amonge whom was his el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest sonne, called <hi>Guascar Inga, Mango Inga,</hi> and <hi>Paulo Inga</hi> and diuerse others. And in <hi>Quito</hi> hee married another Wife, Daughter vnto the Lorde of that Countrey, and of her hee begot a Sonne, called <hi>Atabaliba,</hi> who hee loued excéedinglye: so that now hée determined to returne to <hi>Cusco,</hi> leauinge his Sonne with a Tutor in <hi>Quito,</hi> but in this returne, hee found the Calsey in the Mountayne broken and spoyled, as herebefore hath béene declared.</p>
               <p>After hee had abode in <hi>Cusco</hi> certaine yeares, hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to returne againe to <hi>Quito,</hi> not onely because that Countrey contented him much, but also with desire to sée his Wife, and young Sonne, whom he loued more than any other of his Children: and this Iorney hee tooke in hande, by the highe waye that was made in the Playnes, and from this time forward, hee retourned no more to <hi>Cusco,</hi> but abode all his life time in <hi>Quito,</hi> &amp; gaue that Land or Prouince which hee had with force conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, to his Sonne <hi>Atabaliba,</hi> because the same had béen of his Grandfathers.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Atabaliba</hi> desired that he would let him sée that booke, which forthwith was deliuered vnto him, and hauing it in his hands, he turned from leafe to leafe.

Also there were in some places excéeding good archers, who were clothed in Zeale skinnes: But the extreeme colde did much annoy them, aswell the bitter sharpe aire, as the frost and snow, &amp; also the passage ouer the mountaines, which were couered with snow, where it hapned that a captaine called <hi>Ruydias,</hi> who followed <hi>Don Diego de Alma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gro,</hi> had many of his men and horses frozen to death, for neither their apparrel nor armour could resist the excée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding sharpnes of the aire, which did so vehemently pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate and fréese them. The extremitie of this cold was such, that at the end of fiue moneths, when <hi>Don Diego</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned toward <hi>cusco,</hi> he found some of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany which had followed outward, frozen to death, standing on their feete, leaning vpon the Rockes, and holding their horse bridels in their hands: and their horses likewise frozen to death, as fresh without corruption, as though at that instant they had dyed.</p>
               <p>The carcases of which horses was a great reliefe for his men at his said returne, for want of other victualles, and after they were past the extremitie of cold, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> came they into such a wildernes, without any kinde of habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, where they stoode in as great a néede of water to drinke, so that their chiefe remedy was to carrye with them from the snowy hilles, shéepes skinnes full of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in such sort, that euery liue sheepe carryed on his backe, the Skinne of an other dead Sheepe full of water.</p>

But <hi>Inga</hi> deceiptfully sent hym woorde, that he should come personally and talke with hym, and so he did, with suspition of some deceipte: wherefore he lefte some of his menne with <hi>Iuan de Sayauedra,</hi> and tooke the reste with hym. But when <hi>Inga</hi> espied tyme conuenient, he sette vppon hym with suche a vehement courage, that <hi>Don Diego</hi> was glad to retire. In the meane season, <hi>Herna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>do Pisarro,</hi> hauyng knowledge of his commyng, went to visite <hi>Iuan de Sayaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra</hi> at his Campe, and mought haue taken hym prisoner if he had would, as the Citezens of <hi>Cusco</hi> had counsailed hym to doe, but he would not, rather when he had spoken with hym, he retourned backe vnto the Citie, without the giuyng vnto him of any vngentle language, How be it, <hi>Iuan de Sayauedra</hi> reported afterward, that he had offered vnto hym 5000. poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes in gold, to deliuer into his power all the men whiche were in his companie, and that he refused the money. When <hi>Don Diego</hi> was retourned from <hi>Inga,</hi> he came with all his armie in the sight of the Citie with his Ensignes spread, where he tooke fower horsemen, whiche <hi>Hernando Pisarro</hi> had sent to talke with hym, he also sent to require the state and Cheef Magistrates of the Citie, to receiue hym for their gouernour accordyng to the Emperours letters Patentes graunted to hym, whiche were ready to bee seen.

it should be verified that the Citie of <hi>Cusco,</hi> should fall out of the league of grounde, specified in the graunt of <hi>Don Francis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co,</hi> then would thei yeelde to his request, and also obeye hym, as reason and duetie should require. But their wise and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle aunswere was neuer performed: By meane whereof after did followe suche greate damage, slaughter, and discorde, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene these twoo valliaunt Captaines: and although sundrie tymes thei mette to measure by line the lande, that should ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine to eche of them, yet thei neuer agreed vpon the cause: For sometymes thei would saie that the leagues of lande, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertainyng to the gouernation of <hi>Don Francisco,</hi> should bee measured a long the Sea coste, acceptyng into the reconyng all Creekes, Bayes, and croked heade landes, or Capes.

So that by eche of these twoo reconynges, the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement of <hi>Don Francisco</hi> did finishe a greate waie, before thei could come to <hi>Cusco</hi>: yea some saied, before thei could come to the Citie of Kynges. But <hi>Don Francisco</hi> pretended that their opinions were not iuste, nor lawfull in that forme of measuring: but rather saied he, that thei should measure ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rules of the <hi>altitude</hi> of the Sunne, allowing the due nomber of leagues to euery degree, beginnyng at the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctiall</hi> line, accordyng to Astronomers reconyng in the Northe and Southe course, by the superior line, and in so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng the Citie should fall into the iursdiccion of <hi>Pisarro.</hi> But bee it as maie bee: for as yet vntill this daie the matter was neuer agreed vpon, that is to saie, whether the Citie of <hi>Cus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co</hi> doeth fall into the newe Castile, or in the newe Toledo, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though sundrie tymes, bothe Pilotes and learned Geometri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s hath met to decide the cause, especially the Licenciall <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca de Castro,</hi> who had a perticular Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mission touchyng that matter, and as yet sentence was neuer pronounced. But now letting this discord ceasse, &amp; returnyng again to the Historie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hernando Pisarro,</hi> sent woorde vnto <hi>Don Diego</hi> that he would prepare a certaine parte of the Citie, for hym and his

retine we to lodge in, and in the meane while he would aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise his brother <hi>Don Francisco,</hi> of his demaunde: who at that instaunt was abiding in the Citie of the Kyngs, to the intent that some order might be taken betweene them, consideryng that thei were bothe freendes and companions: And to treate of this matter, some doe affirme, that truce was taken vpon that condition, so that vnder that conclusion, eche one held him self to be in securitie. <hi>Hernando Pisarro</hi> caused that night all the Citezens and menne of warre, to take their reste in their houses, because thei were greatly wearied with watchyng, and wearyng their armour daies and nightes, without ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng any rest at all.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Don Diego</hi> had aduise of the Citezens reste and securitie, and the night beyng verie darke, especially through a darke Cloude, whiche at that instaunt couered the Citie, he forthwith assaulted the Citie. But when <hi>Hernando</hi> and <hi>Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salo Pisarro</hi> heard the noise, thei made greate haste in arming them selues, and their house beeyng the first that was assaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, thei like valliant gentlemen defended them selues, vntill thei had set fire on euery side of the house, wherevpon thei yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and were in this order taken prisoners.</p>
               <p>The next daie followyng <hi>Don Diego</hi> compelled the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saill of the Citie, to receiue hym for their cheef ruler and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour: and also commaunded <hi>Hernando</hi> and <hi>Gonsalo Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarro</hi> to be put in Irons, yea and many of his councellers wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed hym to put them to death, the whiche councell he refused considering the noble courage and minde, whiche thei shewed in the defence of their house, so that thei were put in the custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of <hi>Diego de Aluarado.</hi> Also it was credibly thought that certaine Indians were the occasion, that <hi>Don Diego</hi> did breake the truse that was made, and also some Spanyardes, who brought newes vnto hym, that <hi>Hernando Pisarro</hi> had commaunded to breake donne the bridges, and the Fortresse in the Citie, whiche newes seemed to bee the verie originall cause. For when <hi>Don Diego</hi> entered into the Citie, he spake these woordes with a loude voyce: Oh how haue ye deceiued me with your deceiptfull newes, for here I finde bothe brid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,

But <hi>Hernando Pisarro</hi> would not graunt their request, rather he commaunded to pitche his Campe in the Mountaine.</p>

When Seruice was ended in the Parrishe Church: the Doctor <hi>Iuan Velasques,</hi> and Captaine <hi>Francisco de Chaues,</hi> who at that instaunt was the chéefest person in the Lande, next vnto the <hi>Marquesse,</hi> came together acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panied with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others, to the Lord <hi>Marquesse</hi> his house, &amp; after theyr visitation was made, the most of the Cittizens returned home to theyr houses.

               <p>
                  <hi>Iuan de Herrada,</hi> with other twelue companions, came from his house which standeth thrée hundreth paces dista<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t from the <hi>Marquesse</hi> house, through the open stréetes, with

theyr swords ready drawne in theyr hands, crying with a loude voice, saying: Let the Tyrant traytor die, who hath commaunded the Iudge to be slaine, which the King our Maister sent into this land. The cause which they helde, not to goe in secrete wise, but rather with all the noyse possible, that the Cittizens should imagine theyr nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber to be great, considering y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they durst attempt such a waighty matter so publiquely, and also at such an howre, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they should come with all speede to the sacker, yet they should come too late, or else them selues to be slaine.</p>
               <p>In this forme they came to the <hi>Marquesse</hi> house, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing one at his gate, with a drawne sworde in his hande, which was bloodied with the blood of a Ram: who cryed with a loude voice, dead is the Tyrant, dead is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Tyrant.

               <p>When this sorrowfull newes was knowne in the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, there came aboue two hundred men to ayde <hi>Don Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go de Almagro,</hi> for though they were armed and in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse, yet they durst not come abroade, tyll they perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knew how the matter would passe.

And when this was done, he sackt the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quesse</hi> house, and also the houses of his Brother &amp; his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretarie.

               <p>It was a sorrowfull spectacle to behold and heare, the Wiues of dead men, what dolefull cries they made, yea, &amp; the lamentable words that they spake.

               <p>SIthens this Historie and Discouery of the Prouince of <hi>Peru,</hi> hath origen from the two valiant Captaines, of whome hyther vnto we haue spoken: Who are y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

But in the residue they were bothe valiaunt persons of great cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, they were also great sufferers of paynes &amp; trauails, and verie vertuous, they were fréends to doo plesure to al men, at theyr owne cost. They were much lyke of incly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, especially, in the state of lyuing, for neyther of them was married, although the youngest of them bothe at the tyme of theyr death, was aboue thrée score and fiu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> yéeres of age.</p>
               <p>They were bothe enclined to affayres of Warres, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though, <hi>Don Diego de Almagro,</hi> when occasion of Warres wanted, applied him selfe to thinges of gaynes: they were néere of one age, when they tooke the conquest of <hi>Peru</hi> in hande, in which Discouerie and conquest, they tooke the paynes which hath bene declared although the <hi>Marquesse</hi> dyd suffer greater trauaile, and passed greater peryls then <hi>Don Diego.</hi> For whylst the one was occupied in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test part of the Discouerie, the other abode in <hi>Panama,</hi> prouiding necessaries &amp; Furniture for him, as lykewise hath bene declared. They were bothe noble minded, and alwayes they pretended and conceyued haughty thinges, they were gentle and amyable to theyr Soldiours, they were equall in lyberallitie: although in shewe, <hi>Don Diego</hi> had the aduantage, because he loued that his gift should be published and blowne abroade: vnto which condition the <hi>Marquesse</hi> was contrarie, for he would not permit that his lyberall giftes should be spoken of: but rather procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to haue them kept in secrete, hauing more respect to prouide for the necessitie of such as wanted, then to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine a vaineglorious report.</p>
               <p>It once happened that a poore Soldiour, had his chéefe ritches in a Horse, which dyed of an vnknown disease, of which mishap the <hi>Marquesse</hi> hauing vnderstanding, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming downe into his Tennis Court, thinking to finde
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:12091:82"/>
the poore soldiour there, he brought in his bosome a wedge of Golde, of ten pound weight, to giue vnto him with his owne hands: and not finding him there at that instant, he chaunced to make a match at play, &amp; without putting off his coate, he played his match, because he would not that any should sée the wedge of Gold which was in his bosom. The play co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued the space of thrée howres, &amp; then came the Soldior for whome the golde was brought, the which he delyuered vnto him secretly, saying: that he had rather haue giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him thrée times as much, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to suffer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> paines which he had taken in his long tarying: with many other lyke examples, which might at length be spoken of.</p>
               <p>So that alwayes the <hi>Marquesse</hi> almes and giftes were distributed by his owne handes, and with asmuch secresie as might be, yea, and alwayes procured the receyuers to keepe silence: And for this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sideration, <hi>Don Diego</hi> was belde to be more liberall, for although he gaue largely, yet he had a forme how it should séem much more then it was: notwithstanding, touching this vertue of Magnificence, they may iustly be called equall. The <hi>Marquesse</hi> also was wont to say, that considering the company of aduenture and fellowship made betwéene them, that neither of them could giue any thing wherein the other had not his part, &amp; therfore as lyberall was he, which permitted the other to giue: and for comprobation, this shall serue. That where they were bothe the ritchest men, bothe in Rent &amp; Treasure, and as lyberally might dispend the same, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Prince in the world, not hauing a kingly Crowne: yet they came bothe to death with great pouertie: that at this day, there is not any remembraunce of any thing proper, which was theyrs: sauing, that of all theyr goods &amp; lands, they had not wherewithall to burie them: as the lyke is written of <hi>Cato</hi> &amp; <hi>Silla,</hi> and of many other <hi>Romane</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, which were buried of almes.</p>
               <p>These two valiant Captaines, were aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:12091:83"/>
and to deliuer them from peryls. But the <hi>Marquesse</hi> dyd rather in that respect excéed: For once it happened, passing the Riuer called <hi>Barranca,</hi> that the great Currant caried away one of his <hi>Indians</hi> of seruice, which by mishap was fallen therein: and when the <hi>Marquesse</hi> sawe the peryll of his seruaunt, he foorthwith stripped him selfe, &amp; leapt into the Riuer, hauing good skill of swimming, and pluckt him out by the haire of his head: putting him selfe in great daunger, through the extreame force of the Currant, in such sort that the valiantest man in all his host, durst not take the lyke enterprise in hande: wherupon some of his Captaines dyd reprehend his ouer much boldnesse, vnto whome he aunswered, saying: Ye know not what thing it is to looue a seruaunt well.</p>
               <p>Although the <hi>Marquesse</hi> gouerned long time, and more quietly: yet <hi>Don Diego</hi> was more ambicious, and desirous of rule and dignitie. Bothe of them conserued antiquitie, in theyr ordinarie apparell, euen from their youth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes, especially the <hi>Marquesse,</hi> who euer vsed to weare ordinarily a Coate of black cloath, with long quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and short wasted, his shooes of a white Déere skin, and a white felt Hat, and his Sworde &amp; Dagger of aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient facion. And when through the importunate request of his seruants, vpon any solempne holy day, he happened to weare a Gowne furred with Martins, which the Lord <hi>Marquesse Cortez</hi> had sent to him from the new <hi>Spaine</hi>: as soone as he came from Church, he would throwe it fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, and vsed to haue a towell about his necke. In the tyme of, Peace, he vsed much to play at Tennis, or at Bowles, and therefore chéeflie he vsed the Towell about his necke, to wype the sweat from his face.</p>
               <p>Bothe these Captaynes were most patient in paynes taking, and also in any extremitie of hunger: But per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the <hi>Marquesse,</hi> shewed the same in the exercise of the sayde pastimes, for there were very fewe young men that could endure with him. He was also more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clyned
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:12091:83"/>
to any kinde of pastime, then <hi>Don Diego,</hi> so that many tymes he would play at the Bowles, all the whole day, and passed not with whome he played, although it were eyther with Marriner or Myller, nor yet would permitte any to take vp his Bowle for him, nor to vse towarde him any vsuall ceremonies of duety, accustomed to his Estate and dignitie. It was some waighty mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that should cause him to leaue from play, especially, when he was a looser. But if at any he had aduertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of rebellion, or insurrection of <hi>Indians</hi>: then foorth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with his Armor was at hand, and Launce in readinesse, he vsed in such extremities, to ryde Poste alone through the Cittie, towarde the place where the alteration was, without tarying for more company.</p>
               <p>These Captaynes were so ready, and of such haughty courage in the <hi>Indian</hi> warre, that eyther of them would not let to giue the Encounter, although the enimies were in number .100000. They were of good vnderstanding and iudgement in any thing, that was to be prouided for the warres, or for gouernment: especially, being bothe men vnlearned, for they could neyther write, reade, or yet firme, which was a thing of great deffect, in such noble Personages, dealing in such waightie affayres. Yet neuerthelesse, in all other thinges, of vertuous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clynations, they shewed them selues to be Noble men, onely the former want excepted, wherein the auncient wyse men, dyd holde such want for an argument of bas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The <hi>Marquesse</hi> was a man that had great confidence in his seruaunts and fréendes. All the dispatches which he made, aswell in gouernment, and reprehencion of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> he vsed to make two markes, betwéene the which, <hi>Antonio Picado,</hi> his Secretary, fyrmed, the name of <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisco Pisarro.</hi> But these men may excuse them selues, as <hi>Ouidius</hi> excused <hi>Romulus,</hi> saying: that he was an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyll Astronomer, but rather had more knowledge in

Armes then in Letters.</p>
               <p>Bothe these Captaynes were so affable and playne, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong theyr people, that they vsed oftentimes to goe from house to house in the Cittie, to visite theyr neyghbours a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, &amp; tooke such fare as they founde, and were alwayes ready to come to any honest neyghbour, that would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite eyther of them. They were equally abstynent and moderate in theyr féeding, and dyet, as also in refraining of sensuallitie, and especially from abusing of any <hi>Spanish</hi> Women: for they déemed that they could not deale there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, without preiudice of theyr neighbours, whose Wiues or Daughters, those Women were: they neyther ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much enclyned to the <hi>Indian</hi> Women.</p>

            <p>The riches was so great which heare they founde, that

almost in euery vayne where they made their ensay, they founde the greatest parte of Ewre to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e fine siluer, and the basest Mines were by valuacion .480. duckets, in euery hundred weight of Ewre, which is the greatest riches, that euer hath ben seen or written of. When the Iustice of the towne of Plate, had vnderstandynge of this fortunate suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse, the Ruler of the sayd Towne came &amp; deuided the said Mynes amonge the townes men, and eche of them made his choyse according to his lot.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>Anaconas,</hi> which came thither to worke were many in number, in sutch sort that in short time they built at the foote of the saide hill, a Towne to dwell in, which multiplied in suche wise, that there inhabited of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian workemen aboue .7000. persons, which did so well vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand that businesse, that they came to agréement with their maisters, to allow vnto them a wéekely pention: but their gayne was twise so mutche as they payde vnto their maysters.</p>
            <p>The vaines of these Mines is of sutche qualitie, that the Ewre wil not melt with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> winde of Bellowes, as in other Mines are accustomed: but their meltyng is in certain litle Furnaces, called <hi>Guayras,</hi> wherein they vse to melt with coles and sheepes dung, with the only force of the ayre, with out any other instrument. These Mines are called <hi>Potosi,</hi> by reason that al the borders there about are so called.</p>
            <p>These Indian workemen are riche, for he that hath but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>When the reperticion of these Mines were made, they began to prouide all sortes of necessary Uictualles for the woorkemen, which was a thing very difficil to doo, consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> great number of Indians which daily came to serue
<pb facs="tcp:12091:100"/>
in those workes, wherby victualles grew to such a dearth, that a bushell of Maiz, came to be worth twentie castlins of Gold, and a bushell of Wheate as much: and a Sacke of the earbes, called <hi>Coca,</hi> was worth .30. poyzes, yea, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward it came to bee derer: yet through the great treasure which there was founde, all the other Mines were left vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited, and especially the Mines of <hi>Porco,</hi> where <hi>Hernando Pisarro</hi> had a great porcion of ground, out of the whiche hee gathered great riches.</p>
            <p>The Mines also which gathered gold in <hi>Cambaya,</hi> &amp; other riuers, left their workes &amp; came to <hi>Potosi,</hi> because they fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d there greater profit without co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parison. They which vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand in these workes, holde opinion that by manifest to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens these Mines are of perpetuitie.</p>
