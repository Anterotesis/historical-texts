            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

will receive an account in the <hi>Preface.</hi> And the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, if the considerations following; are not of weight, to attone for; I know you have goodness enough to pardon, what I have not reason sufficient to excuse, or vindicate. Well meaning intentions are <hi>Apology</hi> enough, where candour, and ingenuity are the Judges. I was not induced then to this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse, because I thought I could oblige you; Worth

describes it self in the fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Character. But refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting upon that delight &amp; satisfaction, that I have received in discoursing with you on such matters; and knowing that your noble genius is gratified by such kind of speculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; I thought I could not make more suitable payment for my content, or better acknowledge the favour I receive in your acquaintance, then by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting you a Discourse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout

               <hi>Praeexistence;</hi> &amp; giving you a peculiar interest in <hi>it,</hi> as you have in its <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour.</hi> Not that I would sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest, that you are a Favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of any strange opinions, or hold any thing in this particular, or any other, that is fit to be discounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanc'd.

<pb facs="tcp:53397:3"/>
nobleness of your spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; that amidst the flowing aboundance of the world's blessings with which you are encircled, you can yet dedicate your self to your belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>contemplations;</hi> and look upon the furniture and accomplishments of the mind, as better riches, than the largest doals of fortune, and the wealth and Revenues of an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple inheritance.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is none of the least commendable indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies of our Church, that she allowes us a latitude of judging in points of <hi>Speculation.</hi> And ties not up mens conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to an implicit assenting to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, not <hi>necessary</hi> or <hi>Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental;</hi> which favourable and kind <hi>permission,</hi> is questionlesse a great obligation upon the inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious, submissively to receive &amp; observe her pious appointments for <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>order.</hi> Nor is there lesse <hi>Reason</hi> in this <hi>parental indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,</hi> then there is of Christian
<pb facs="tcp:53397:6"/>
               <hi>charity</hi> and <hi>prudence;</hi> since to tie all others up to our opinions, and to impose difficult and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputable matters under the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Confessions</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>fundamentals</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> is a most uncharistian piece of <hi>Tyranny,</hi> the foundation of <hi>persecution,</hi> and very root of <hi>Antichristianisme.</hi> So that I have often wondred, that those that heretofore would have forced all men to a compliance with their darling <hi>notions,</hi> and would have made a prey of them, that could not bow down before the <hi>Idol</hi> of their new-framed <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxy;</hi> should yet have the face to object <hi>persecution</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian <hi>Tyranny</hi> to our Church Appointments; when them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb facs="tcp:53397:6"/>
under a deep and crimson guilt of those very same miscari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, which they endeavour to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix upon those more innocent <hi>constitutions.</hi> For is it not a far more blameable and obnoxious imposition to srame <hi>systems</hi> of disputable <hi>opinions,</hi> &amp; to require their admittance into our <hi>Creeds,</hi> in the place of the most <hi>sacred, necessary,</hi> and <hi>fundamental</hi> verities; Than it is to appoint some harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse orders of <hi>circumstance</hi> and <hi>ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony,</hi> which in themselves are <hi>indifferent</hi> and <hi>innocent.</hi> And let any equal man be judge, which is the greater <hi>superstition,</hi> either to <hi>idolize</hi> and place <hi>religion</hi> in things of <hi>dispute</hi> and meer <hi>opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi> or conscienciously to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
<pb facs="tcp:53397:7"/>
the <hi>Sanctions</hi> of that <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> we are bound to obey. But how all those ill applyed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> recoyle upon those that discharge them, I have fully proved in a Discourse on this subject, which in its due time may see the <hi>Light.</hi> But for the present I go on with what I was about; Therefore I say, 'tis a most commendable excellency in our <hi>Ecclesiastical Constitutions,</hi> which with all due regard ought to be acknowledged; That they in some few matters of <hi>opinion,</hi> but such, as are of important concernment, or very <hi>meridian</hi> truthes, which I mention not to this purpose, as if men might
<pb facs="tcp:53397:7"/>
therefore indulge themselves in what conceits and dangerous o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions soever their phancies might give birth to; This were an unpardonable abuse of that noble and ingenious Liberty that is afforded us. But that they might see the beauty of those well temper'd Constitutions; and that the mouth of obloquy might be stopped that slaunders our Church, as if it yielded no scope at all for <hi>free inquiry;</hi> when I dare say there is not a Church in Christendome, that in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard is lesse <hi>Criminal.</hi> As for the opinion of <hi>Praeexistence,</hi> the subject of the following Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, it was never determined against by ours, nor any other
<pb facs="tcp:53397:8"/>
Church that I know of; And therefore I conceive is left as a matter of <hi>School Speculation,</hi> which without danger may be <hi>problematically</hi> argued on either hand. And I have so great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in all true Sons of our common Mother to think, that they will not fix any harsh and severe censures, upon the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent <hi>Speculations</hi> of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hose, though possibly they may be Errours, who own the <hi>Authority, Articles, Canons,</hi> and <hi>Constitutions</hi> of that Church which they are so deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly zealous for. Therefore let me here premonish once for all, that I intend no Innovation in Religion, or disturbance of our established and received
<pb facs="tcp:53397:8"/>
Doctrines, by any thing I have undertaken in this little <hi>Treatise;</hi> But only an innocent represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of an Antient and Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble opinion, which I conceive may contribute somewhat to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the clearing and vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the <hi>Divine Attributes,</hi> and so representing the ever blessed <hi>Deity,</hi> as a more fit object of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Adoration,</hi> then the <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions</hi> of the <hi>World</hi> make him. And what ever may be thought of the thing it self, or the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage of this affair, I'me <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> the end and design is concerning and important, and deserves at least a favourable construction of the undertaking. For there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more for the interest of
<pb facs="tcp:53397:9"/>
               <hi>religion,</hi> then that God be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to his creatures as amiable &amp; lovely, which cannot be better done, then by clearing up his providences and dealings with the sons of men, and discovering them to be full of Equity, Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and Benignity, so that though I should be mistaken in the opinion which I endeavour to recommend, yet I expect the candour of the ingenious being betray'd into an errour, if it be one, by so pardonable an occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. If it be excepted against this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, that the Doctrine of <hi>Praeexistence</hi> hath in a late Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course been purposely handled; besides what the learned D. <hi>More</hi> hath written of it; and therefore
<pb facs="tcp:53397:9"/>
that this labour may seem a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous, unnecessary Repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I answer, that that very Treatise, viz the Account of <hi>Origen,</hi> made some such thing as this, expedient. For though the proof and management of this affair be there unexceptionable, as far as the Authour is by his design ingaged; yet, he being consined to the reasons of <hi>Origen,</hi> and to the answering such obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, as the <hi>Fathers</hi> urged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him; hath not so fully sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

And yet I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse my self to be so much a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temner of the halfe witted cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surers of things they know not, that this Reason alone could not have moved my pen the breadth of a letter; But some ingenious friends of mine, who were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to do their maker right, in a due apprehension of his Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes and Providences having read the Letter of Resolution, and thence being induced to think favourably of <hi>Praeexistence,</hi> were yet not fully satisfied in the proof, nor able to give stop to those <hi>objections,</hi> which their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect knowledge of the <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis</hi> occasioned: wherefore
<pb facs="tcp:53397:11"/>
they desired me to draw up a more full &amp; particular Account of that Doctrine, which they had now a kindnesse for, and which wanted nothing more to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it to them, but a clear and full representation. For their satisfaction then, I drew up the following Discourse, intending at first, that it should go no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then their hands, whose in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in mine affections had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded it; but they being more then I could well pleasure with written Copies, and perceiving others of my acquaintance also, to whom I owe regard and service, to be in the like condition with these; I was induced to let this <hi>Little Trifle</hi> tread a more <hi>publick</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:53397:11"/>
               <hi>Stage;</hi> and to speak my mind to them from the <hi>Presse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If further reason be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted for mine undertaking a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse in which others have been ingaged, I would desire them to consider what an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite of books are written upon almost all subjects can be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. And I am confident, if they turn 'ore <hi>Libraries,</hi> they'l find no <hi>theam,</hi> that is of any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, lesse traced then this is. So that no body hath reason to call it a <hi>Crambe,</hi> who considers, that there are multitudes, even of Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars that have never seen or heard of any thing of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; And there is not, that
<pb facs="tcp:53397:12"/>
I know of, any one book extant in any language besides this, that purposely, solely, and fully treats of <hi>Praeexistence.</hi> Wherefore who ever condemns this as a superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ingagement, if he will be just, must passe the same censure upon well nigh every Discourse the Presse is deliver'd of, for hee'l meet with few written on less<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handled subjects. I might urge also if there were need on't, that various representations of the same thing, fit the variety of phansyes and gusts of perusers; and that may have force and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valence to perswade in one for me, which signifies nothing in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. But 'tis enough; he that will judge me on this account,
<pb facs="tcp:53397:12"/>
must passe the same award on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Sermon he heares, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Book he looks on; And such a censure will do me as little hurt, as him good, that passeth it.</p>
            <p>Besides this exception, 'tis not unlikely that some may object, that I use <hi>Arguments</hi> that have already been pleaded in behalf of this opinion; which rightly understood, is no matter of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repute; since every one else doth it that deals in a subject formerly written of. And I would have him that commenceth such a charge against me, to consult di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Authours who have handled the same subject; and if he find not the same Arguments and
<pb facs="tcp:53397:13"/>
Reasons infinitely repeated eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where, let him call me <hi>plagiary,</hi> &amp; spare not. 'Tis true therefore I have not baulk't the reasons of <hi>Origen,</hi> Dr. <hi>More,</hi> or the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of the Letter of <hi>Resolution,</hi> because they had been used alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; but freely own the assistance of those worthy Authours; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I think I have so managed, fortified, &amp; secured them against exceptions, especially the most considerable, that I may reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly expect a pardon, yea and an interest in them also. For 'tis the backing of an argument that giv's it force &amp; efficacy; which I have done to the most weighty of them, at my proper cost &amp; charges. Nor should I have been faithful to my
<pb facs="tcp:53397:13"/>
cause, had I omitted any thing that I thought confirm'd it, upon any pretence whatever; since pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly this discourse may fall into the hands of some, who never met with those other Authors. And my design being a full proof, defence, &amp; explication of <hi>Praeexistence,</hi> it had been an unpardonable defect to have permitted those weighty reasons by which it's learned As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertours have inforced it. If any yet should criminat me (as I know some did the <hi>account of Origen,</hi>) for using many of the same <hi>words,</hi> and some of the same <hi>phrases &amp; expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,</hi> that those others; who have writ about those matters have made use of; I am not very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to answer them in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and I doubt this engagement
<pb facs="tcp:53397:14"/>
against those little seruples, will be importunate to the judicious. For no body blames the frequent usage of words of Art; or those which the first <hi>Masters</hi> or <hi>Resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers</hi> of any Doctrine have been wont to express their notions by since that such words and expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions are best understood, as have by custome or the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of some great Authours been appropriated to such Doctrines, as they have imploy'd them in the service of. And should eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man that writes on any sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, be obliged to invent a new, all the termes he hath need of, and industriously to shun those <hi>proper, expressive words</hi> and <hi>phrases</hi> that are fitted to his hands, and
<pb facs="tcp:53397:14"/>
the business he is about; all things will be fill'd with <hi>impertinency, darkness</hi> &amp; <hi>confusion.</hi> It must be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged then, that most of the peculiar <hi>words</hi> &amp; <hi>phrases</hi> that either I, or any body else that will speak properly &amp; intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in this matter, make use of, are borrowed from the judicious and elegant contriver of them, the profound Restorer &amp; Refiner of almost-extinct <hi>Platonism:</hi> whose invention hath been so happy in this kind, that it hath served up those notions in the most <hi>apposite, significant, comprehensive</hi> and <hi>expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive</hi> words that could well be thought of, where fore 'twere an humoursome piece of folly for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man that deals in these matters
<pb facs="tcp:53397:15"/>
industriously to avoid such <hi>termes</hi> and <hi>expressions</hi> as are so adopted and fitted to this purpose, and so well known among those that are acquainted with this way of <hi>Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;</hi> when without vanity he could not think to be better sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish't from his own phancy. If in the following papers I have u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed any <hi>expressions</hi> of others, which these considerations will not warrant; I must beg pardon for my <hi>memory</hi> which doth not use to be so serviceable. And where I writ this Discourse, I had not one of my books within my reach, that treated of <hi>this,</hi> or <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed any other subject.</hi> Nor am I at leasure now to examine, them and <hi>this,</hi> to see whether I can find

any such <hi>coincidences;</hi> which a mans phancy dealing frequently in such matters, might insensibly oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion.

               </hi> or however else they treat them, they shall not much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please the Authour. And now that this Discourse may pass with lesse controul among those that shall light on it, I find my self in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd to speak a little to a double sort of Readers, who are like to be offended at my design &amp; averse to the <hi>Doctrine</hi> asserted in these <hi>Papers,</hi> And (1) some will bog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle at <hi>Praeexistence,</hi> &amp; be afraid to entertain it, upon an apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that the Admission of this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion will disorder and change
<pb facs="tcp:53397:16"/>
the Frame of <hi>orthodox</hi> Divinity, which, were there cause for such a jealousy, were but a commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable caution; but there's hope this may prove but a panick fear, or such a needless terrour as surpriseth children in the dark, when they take their best friends for some <hi>bug-bear</hi> that would car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry them away, or hurt them. For 'tis but supposing (as I have some where intimated in the discourse it self) that God created all souls together as he did the Angels That some of them sinned and fell with the other <hi>Apostate spirits;</hi> and for their disobedience were thrust into a state of silence and insensibility; That the <hi>Divine goodnesse</hi> so provided for them,
<pb facs="tcp:53397:16"/>
that they should act a part again in <hi>terrestrial</hi> bodyes, when they should fitly be prepared for them; And that <hi>Adam</hi> was set up as our great <hi>Protoplast</hi> and <hi>Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentative,</hi> who had he continued in <hi>Innocence</hi> and <hi>Integrity,</hi> we had then been sharers in that happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse which he at first was insta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in; but by his unhappy defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and disobedience we lost it; and became thus miserable in our <hi>New life</hi> in these earthly bodyes. I say the Doctrine of <hi>Praeexistence</hi> thus stated, is in nothing that I know of, an enemy to <hi>common Theology:</hi> all things hence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding as in our ordinary Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stems; with this only difference, that this <hi>Hypothesis</hi> cleares the <hi>di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:53397:17"/>
of harshnesse or inequality, since it supposeth us to have sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and deserved all the misery we suffer in this condition before we came hither; whereas the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which teacheth, that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came both guilty and miserable by the single and sole offence of <hi>Adam,</hi> when as we were not then in being; or as to our souls, as much as <hi>potentially</hi> in our great <hi>Progenitour;</hi> beares somewhat hardly upon the repute of the <hi>Divine perfections.</hi> So that if the wary Reader be afraid to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon the <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> that I have drawn up at the end, (which I confesse I would not give him the least incouragement to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with) yet, without danger he may admit of <hi>Praeexsistence</hi> as
<pb facs="tcp:53397:17"/>
accommodated to the <hi>Orthodox</hi> Doctrine. Nor should I indeed have medled with the other <hi>scheam,</hi> which is built upon the <hi>Principles</hi> of meer <hi>reason</hi> and <hi>phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy;</hi> but that those friends who drew the rest of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course from me, ingag'd me to give them an Account of the <hi>Philosophicall Hypothesis.</hi> In which, I know I have not in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular, followed the mind of the Masters of the <hi>Origenian Cabbala;</hi> but kept my self to the conduct of those <hi>Principles,</hi> that I judged most rational; though indeed the things wherein I dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, are very few and inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. However for that reason I thought fit, to intitle no body to the <hi>Hypothesis</hi> that I have made
<pb facs="tcp:53397:18"/>
a draught of, least I should have affix't on any one, what he would not have owned. But for the main, those that understand it, know the Fountain; and for others, 'tis no great matter if they be ignorant. Now if any one judge me to be a proselyte to those <hi>opinions,</hi> because I call them not all to nought, or damn those, that have a favour for them; I know not how to avoid the doom of their severe displeasure; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving said as much in the place where I treat of those matters, to purge my self of such a suspition as I thought necessary to cleare me, in the opinion of any compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently ingenuous. As for others, let me say what I can, I shall be what their wisdomes think fit to
<pb facs="tcp:53397:18"/>
call me; And let that be what it will, I am very well content to bear it. I'le only adde to take off the ground of this uncharitable jealousy, that among thefavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of <hi>Praeexistence,</hi> I know none that are adharers to those <hi>opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions;</hi> &amp; therefore for me to have declaim'd against any, on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, had been a piece of <hi>Knight-Errantry;</hi> And those <hi>Donns</hi> that do so make <hi>Gyants</hi> of the <hi>Wind-mills</hi> of their own <hi>Imaginations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, (2) There are another sort of Readers that I have a word to say to, who contemne &amp; laugh at every thing that their narrow noddles comprehend not. This I confess is a good <hi>easy</hi> way of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation;</hi> &amp; if we may take every fool's smile for a <hi>Demonstration,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:53397:19"/>
               <hi>Praeexistence</hi> will be routed. But the best on't is, to call things by their right names, this is but a vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar childish humour arising from nothing but a fond doating on the opinions we were first instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in. For having made those the standard of truth &amp; solidity, those praepossest decerners pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently conclude every thing that is a stranger to their ears and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings, &amp; of another stamp from their <hi>Education-receptions,</hi> false &amp; ridiculous; just like the common people, who judging all customes and fashions by their own, account those of other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions absurd, and barbarous. 'Tis well for those smiling <hi>Confuters,</hi> that they were not <hi>bred</hi> in <hi>Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metism,</hi> for then without doubt
<pb facs="tcp:53397:19"/>
they would have made sport of <hi>Christianity.</hi> But since they are so disposed, let them laugh at the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion I have undertaken for, till they understand it; I know who in the judgement of wise men will prove <hi>Ridiculous.</hi> It was from this very <hi>principle</hi> that the most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable truthes, that ever the world was acquainted with, were to the <hi>Iews,</hi> a <hi>stumbling block,</hi> and to the <hi>Greeks, foolishness;</hi> and 'twas such a <hi>spirit</hi> as reigns in these chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>self-confidence,</hi> that call'd S. <hi>Paul</hi> a <hi>babler.</hi> And methinks till these narrow scul'd people could boast themselves <hi>infallible,</hi> and all their opinions, an <hi>unerring Canon,</hi> common modesty and civility should teach them better man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, then at first dash to judge
<pb facs="tcp:53397:20"/>
that a ridiculous absurdity; which the greatest and wisest sages that inlightned the antient world, accounted so sound and and probable a <hi>Conclusion.</hi> Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially it being a matter not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd against, but rather countenanc't in <hi>Scripture,</hi> as will appear hereafter. But <hi>opiniative ignorance</hi> is very <hi>weak</hi> &amp; immoral.

               <p n="1">(1) If our Souls came immediately out of the hands of God when we came first into these bodies, Whence then are those enormously brutish inclinations, that strong natural proclivity to vice and impiety, that are exstant in the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men? All the works of God bear his image, and are perfect in their kind. Purity is his nature, and what

comes from him, proportionably to its ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity partakes of his perfections.

How can such a cause produce an effect so disproportionate? Matter can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but by motion, and what relation hath <hi>that</hi> to a moral contagion!

But others think to evade by saying, That we have not these <hi>depravities</hi> in our natures, but contract them by <hi>custome, education,</hi> and evill <hi>usages.</hi> How then comes it about, that those that have had the same care and industry used upon them; and have been nurtured nuder the same d scipline and severe oversight, do so vastly and even to wonder differ in their <hi>inclinations?</hi> How is it that those that are under continual temptations to <hi>vice,</hi> are yet kept within the bounds of <hi>vertue,</hi> and sobriety?

               <head>CHAP. III. (2) Traduction <hi>of</hi> souls <hi>is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, the reasons for it weak and frivolous, the proposal of</hi> Praeexis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</head>
               <p>THus then we have examind the first way of stating the <hi>Soul's original,</hi> that of <hi>continual Creation;</hi> and finding no sure <hi>resting</hi> place for our <hi>inquiry</hi> here, we remove to the second.</p>
               <p>The way of <hi>Traduction</hi> or <hi>seminal Propagation.</hi> And the adherers to this <hi>Hypothesis</hi> are of 2 sorts, <hi>viz.</hi> either such as make the soul to be nothing but a <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer</hi> sort of <hi>matter,</hi> or of those that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess it wholly <hi>spiritual</hi> and <hi>immaterial.</hi> He dispatch the former, briefly strike at the root of their misconceit of the <hi>souls pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction,</hi> and shew it cannot be <hi>Matter,</hi> be it as <hi>pure</hi> as can be conceived.</p>
               <p>Therefore (I) If the <hi>soul</hi> be <hi>matter,</hi> then whatever <hi>perceptions</hi> or <hi>apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> it hath, or is capable of, they were
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53397:31"/>
let in at the <hi>senses.</hi> And thus the great Patron of the <hi>Hypothesis</hi> states it, in his <hi>Leviathan,</hi> and other writings. But now clear it is that our Souls have some <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions,</hi> which they never received from <hi>external sense;</hi> For there are some <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genite implicite Principles</hi> in us, without which there could be no <hi>sensation;</hi> since the <hi>images</hi> of objects are very <hi>smal</hi> and <hi>inconsiderable</hi> in our <hi>brains,</hi> comparative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the vastness of the things which they <hi>represent,</hi> and very unlike them in <hi>multitudes</hi> of other <hi>circumstances,</hi> so that 'twere impossible we should have the <hi>sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible representation</hi> of any thing, were it not that our <hi>souls</hi> use a kind of <hi>Geometry,</hi> or <hi>mathematick</hi> Inference in judging of external objects by those little hints it finds in <hi>material impressions.</hi> Which <hi>Art</hi> and the <hi>principles</hi> thereof were never received from <hi>sense,</hi> but are presuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to all <hi>sensible perceptions.</hi> And, were the <hi>soul</hi> quite vold of all such <hi>implicit no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> it would remain as <hi>senselesse</hi> as a stone for ever.</p>
               <p>Besides, we find our minds fraught
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53397:31"/>
with principles <hi>logical, moral, metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical,</hi> which could never owe their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal to <hi>sense</hi> otherwise, then as it gives us occasions of using them. For <hi>sense</hi> tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth no <hi>general propositions,</hi> but only affords <hi>singulars</hi> for <hi>Induction;</hi> which being an <hi>Inference,</hi> must proceed from an higher <hi>principle</hi> that ownes no such dependence on the <hi>senses</hi> as being found in the mind, and not deriv'd from any thing without. Also we find in our selves <hi>mathematical notions,</hi> and build <hi>certain demonstrations</hi> on them, which abstract from <hi>sense</hi> and <hi>matter.</hi> And therefore never had them from any <hi>material</hi> power but from somthing more sublime and excellent. But this Argument is of too large a consideration to be treated of here and therefore I content my self with those brief Touches, and passe on.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) If the <hi>soul</hi> be <hi>matter</hi> 'tis impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it should have the <hi>sense</hi> of any thing: for either the whole <hi>image</hi> of the <hi>object</hi> must be received in one point of this <hi>sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive matter;</hi> a thing absurd at first view, that such variety of distinct and orderly
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53397:32"/>
                  <hi>representations</hi> should be made at once upon a <hi>single atom;</hi> or the <hi>whole image</hi> is imprest upon every <hi>point,</hi> and then there would be as many <hi>objects</hi> as there are <hi>points</hi> in this <hi>matter;</hi> and so every thing would be infinitely <hi>multiplyed</hi> in our <hi>delusive senses.</hi> Or finally, every part of the <hi>soul</hi> must receive a proportionable part of the <hi>image;</hi> and then, how could those parts communicate their <hi>percepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> to each other, and what should <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive</hi> the <hi>whole?</hi> This Argument is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently managed by the great Dr. <hi>H. More,</hi> in whose writings this fond <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis</hi> is fully <hi>triumpht</hi> over, and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated.</hi> Since therefore the very lowest degree of <hi>perception, single</hi> and <hi>simple sense,</hi> is incompatible to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>body</hi> or <hi>matter,</hi> we may safely conclude, that the higher and nobler operations of <hi>imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, remembring, reasoning,</hi> and <hi>willing</hi> must have a cause and source that is not <hi>Corporeal.</hi> Thus therefore those that build the souls traduction upon this ground of its being only <hi>body</hi> and <hi>modified matter,</hi> are disappointed in the <hi>foundation</hi> of</p>

                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:53397:32"/>
But (2) Another sort of assertors of <hi>traduction</hi> teach the <hi>Soul</hi> to be <hi>spiritual</hi> and <hi>incorporeal,</hi> and affirm that by a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue deriv'd from the first <hi>benediction,</hi> it can propagate its like; one <hi>soul</hi> emitting another as the body doth the matter of <hi>Generation.</hi> The manner of which <hi>spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual production</hi> useth to be illustrated by one candles lighting another; and a mans begetting a thought in anothers mind, without diminishing of his own. This is the most favourable representation of this opinion, that I can think on. And yet, if we nearly consider it, it will appear most <hi>absurd</hi> &amp; <hi>unphilosophical</hi> For if one <hi>soul produce another,</hi> 'tis either out of <hi>nothing</hi> or something <hi>praeexistent.</hi> If the former, 'tis an <hi>absolute creation,</hi> which all <hi>philosophy</hi> concludes impossible for a <hi>Creature.</hi> And if it be pretended that the Parent doth it not by his proper <hi>natural</hi> virtue but by a strength imparted by God in the first <hi>blessing, Increase and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,</hi> so that God is the prime <hi>agent,</hi> he only the <hi>instrument:</hi> I rejoin, that then either God hath thereby obliged himself
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:53397:33"/>
to put forth a new and extraordinary <hi>power</hi> in every such occasion, distinct from his <hi>influence</hi> in the ordinary course of <hi>nature:</hi> Or else (2) he only concurres by his <hi>providence,</hi> as he doth to our other natural actions, we having this Ability be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed upon our very natures. He that asserts the first, runs upon all the rocks that he would avoid in the former <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis</hi> of <hi>continual Creation,</hi> and God will be made the cause of the <hi>sin</hi> and <hi>misery</hi> of his spotless and blameless creatures; which <hi>absurdities</hi> he cannot shun by say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that God, by interposing in such <hi>productions,</hi> doth but follow the <hi>rules</hi> of acting, which he first made while man was innocent. For certainly infinite <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi> would never have tyed up it self to such <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>working,</hi> as he foresaw would presently bring unavoidable <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience, misery,</hi> and <hi>ruine</hi> upon the best part of his <hi>workmanship.</hi> And for the second way, it supposeth God to have no more to do in this <hi>action</hi> then in our <hi>eating</hi> and <hi>drinking.</hi> Consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, here is a <hi>creation</hi> purely <hi>natural.</hi> And

               <p>Again (2) if the <hi>Soul</hi> be <hi>immediately</hi> produced out of <hi>nothing,</hi> be the agent who it will, <hi>God</hi> or the <hi>Parent,</hi> it will be <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>sinlesse.</hi> For, supposing our <hi>parents</hi> to be our <hi>Creators;</hi> they make <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the former, and therefore it fails in the main end it is design'd for.</p>
               <p>Thus we see then that the <hi>traduction</hi>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:53397:34"/>
of the soul supposing it to be <hi>produced</hi> out of <hi>nothing,</hi> cannot be defended.</p>
               <p>Nor doth the second general way, yield any more relief to this <hi>Hypothesis.</hi> For if it be made of any thing <hi>praeexis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,</hi> it is either of <hi>matter</hi> or <hi>spirit.</hi> The former we have undermin'd and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown already, in what was said against those, that hold it to be <hi>body.</hi> And if it be made out of any <hi>spiritual</hi> substance, it must be the <hi>soul</hi> of the <hi>parent,</hi> (except we will revive the old <hi>enthusiastick</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of its <hi>being</hi> a <hi>particle</hi> of the <hi>divine essence</hi>) which supposition is against the nature of an <hi>immaterial</hi> being, a chief property of which, is to be <hi>indiscerpible.</hi> Nor do the <hi>similitudes</hi> I mention'd in the proposal of the <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> at all fit the businesse; for one <hi>candle</hi> lights another, by <hi>separable emissions</hi> that passe from the <hi>flame</hi> of that which is kindled, to the <hi>

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:53397:34"/>
a mans informing anothers mind with a thought which he had not conceived, it is not a <hi>production</hi> of any <hi>substance,</hi> but only an occasioning him to exertan <hi>ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> of his <hi>mind</hi> which he did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And therefore makes nothing to the <hi>illustrating,</hi> how a <hi>soul</hi> can produce a <hi>soul,</hi> a substance <hi>distinct</hi> and without it self; Thus we see how desperate the case of the <hi>soul's original</hi> is in the <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis</hi> of <hi>Traduction</hi> also. But yet to let it have fair play, wee'l give it leave to plead it's cause; and briefly present what is most material in its behalf.</p>
               <p>There are but two reasons that I can think of, worth a naming (1) <hi>A man</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets <hi>a man,</hi> and <hi>a man</hi> he is not without a <hi>soul,</hi> therefore 'tis pretended that the <hi>soul</hi> is <hi>begotten.</hi> But this argument is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily detected of palpable <hi>sophistry,</hi> and is as if one should argue, a man is <hi>mortall</hi> therefore his <hi>soul</hi> is <hi>mortall,</hi> or is <hi>fat</hi> and <hi>lusty</hi> therefore his <hi>soul</hi> is <hi>so.</hi> The absurdity of which kinds of <hi>reasoning</hi> lyes in draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that into a <hi>strict</hi> and <hi>rigorous affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi> which is only meant according
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:53397:35"/>
to <hi>vulgar</hi> speech, and is true only, in some remarkable <hi>respect</hi> or <hi>circumstance.</hi> Thus we say, A <hi>man</hi> begetts a <hi>man,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he doth the <hi>visible</hi> and only <hi>sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> part of him; The vulgar, to whom common speech is accommodate, not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king so much notice of what is past the ken of their <hi>sences.</hi> And therefore <hi>Body</hi> in ordinary speaking is oft put for <hi>Person</hi> as here <hi>man</hi> for the <hi>body.</hi> Sometimes the <hi>noblest part</hi> is us'd for the <hi>whole,</hi> as when 'tis said 70 souls went down with <hi>Jacob</hi> into <hi>Egypt;</hi> therefore such arguments as the <hi>assertours</hi> of <hi>traduction</hi> make use of, which are drawn from vulgar <hi>schemes</hi> of <hi>speech,</hi> argue nothing but the despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratenesse of the <hi>cause,</hi> that needs such pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful <hi>sophistries</hi> to recommend it. Such are these <hi>proofs</hi> which yet are some of the best I meet with, <hi>The seed of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man shall break the serpents head; 66 souls descended out of</hi> Jacobs <hi>loins;</hi> Adam <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat a son in his own likenesse,</hi> and such like. According to this rate of arguing the <hi>scripture</hi> may be made speak any thing that our humoursome phancies
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:53397:35"/>
please to dictate. And thus to <hi>rack</hi> the <hi>sacred</hi> writings, to force them whether they will or no to bring <hi>evidence</hi> to our <hi>opinions;</hi> is an affront to their <hi>Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> that's next to the <hi>denying</hi> on't. I might adde (2) that <hi>begetting</hi> also hath a <hi>lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,</hi> and in common speech signifies not a <hi>strict</hi> and <hi>philosophical production;</hi> So that a man begets a man, though he only generates the <hi>body,</hi> into which fitly <hi>prepared</hi> descends a <hi>soul.</hi> And he that doth that upon which another thing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily follows, is said to be the cause of both.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) The <hi>adherents</hi> to <hi>traduction</hi> use to urge, that, except the <hi>whole man soul</hi> and <hi>body</hi> be <hi>propagated,</hi> there is no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count can be given of our <hi>original defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> And <hi>scripture</hi> gives evident <hi>testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> to that <hi>early pollution;</hi> for we are said to be <hi>conceived in sin,</hi> and <hi>trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressors from the Womb.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have already seen that indeed the way of <hi>daily creating souls,</hi> cannot come off but with vilely aspersing the <hi>divine attributes.</hi> And it hath been hinted, that
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:53397:36"/>
neither can <hi>Traduction</hi> solve the business: for if the <hi>Parent</hi> beget the <hi>soul</hi> out of <hi>nothing,</hi> it will be as <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>clean</hi> as if God himself were it's <hi>immediate crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour;</hi> for though a <hi>clean</hi> thing cannot come out of an <hi>unclean,</hi> when any thing of the <hi>substance</hi> of the <hi>producent</hi> is impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the <hi>effect;</hi> yet where 'tis made out of <hi>nothing</hi> the reason is very different, Yea, the <hi>soul</hi> in all the <hi>powers</hi> that are concern'd in this <hi>production</hi> is now as <hi>clean</hi> and <hi>pure</hi> as ever 'twas; for it is suppos'd to do it by a <hi>capacity</hi> given, at its first <hi>creation</hi> while <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>innocent;</hi> in which respect it is not capable of <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral contagion;</hi> this being an ability meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>plastick,</hi> and not at all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>imperium</hi> or <hi>command</hi> of the <hi>will</hi> the only seat of <hi>morall good</hi> and <hi>evill.</hi> Or, if our souls are but <hi>particles</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerptions</hi> of our <hi>parents,</hi> then I must have been guilty of all the <hi>sins</hi> that ever were committed by my <hi>Progenitors</hi> ever since <hi>Adam;</hi> and by this time, my <hi>soul</hi> would have been so <hi>deprav'd</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch'd,</hi> that it would be now <hi>brutish,</hi>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:53397:36"/>
yea <hi>diabolical.</hi> Thus then we see, that even upon this reason 'tis necessary, to pitch upon some other <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> to give an account of the <hi>pravity</hi> of our <hi>natures;</hi> which both these fayl in the <hi>solution</hi> of. And, since the former com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitts such <hi>violence</hi> upon the honour of the <hi>divine Attributes,</hi> since the latter is so contrary to the nature of things, and since neither can give any satisfaction in the great affairs of providence and our natures, or have any incouragement from the <hi>Sacred Volume;</hi> 'Tis I think very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusable for us to cast our eies abroad, to see if there be no other way, that may probably unriddle those <hi>mysteries,</hi> and relieve the minds of <hi>anxious</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templative</hi> inquirers.

disputants, let us look towards the <hi>antient Sages,</hi> those <hi>eastern Sophi,</hi> that have fill'd the world with the same of their <hi>wisdome;</hi> And since our inquiries are <hi>benighted</hi> in the <hi>west,</hi> let us look to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>East;</hi> from whence 'tis likely the desired <hi>light may</hi> display it self, and chase away the <hi>darknesse</hi> that covers the <hi>face</hi> of those <hi>theories.</hi> Therefore it was the <hi>opinion</hi> of the <hi>Indian Brachmans,</hi> the <hi>Persian Magi,</hi> the <hi>Aegyptian Gymnoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phists,</hi> the <hi>fewish Rabbins,</hi> some of the <hi>Graecian Philosophers,</hi> and <hi>Christian Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> that the souls of men were crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all at first; and at several times and occasions upon forfeiture of their better life and condition, drop't down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to these <hi>terrestrial</hi> bodies.

                  <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> (<hi>Praeexistence</hi>) Praeexistence cannot be dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. <hi>Scripture</hi> saith nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it. It's silence is no preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to this Doctrine, but rather an Argument for it, as the case standeth. Praeexistence was the common opinion of our Saviour's times. How, probably, it came to be lost in the Christian Church.</head>
               <p>THerefore let us see what title it can shew for our <hi>assent,</hi> or whether it can prove it self worthy of the <hi>Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage</hi> of those great <hi>Authors</hi> that have owned it.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) Then, Whether this Doctrine be <hi>true</hi> or no, Im'e confident it cannot be proved <hi>false:</hi> for if All <hi>souls</hi> were not <hi>made</hi> together, it must be, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:53397:38"/>
God <hi>could</hi> not do it; or because he <hi>would</hi> not, for the first, I suppose very few have such <hi>narrow conceptions</hi> of the <hi>divine power,</hi> as to affirm that <hi>omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence</hi> could not produce all those be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings at first, which apart he is suppos'd to <hi>create daily;</hi> which implies no <hi>contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,</hi> or as much as <hi>difficulty,</hi> to be <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived;</hi> and which <hi>de facto</hi> he hath done in the case of <hi>Angells.</hi> Or, if <hi>inconsist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> with any <hi>Attribute</hi> should be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, <hi>that</hi> shall be prov'd quite other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise hereafter; And the <hi>amicable</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence of this <hi>Hypothesis</hi> with them, yea the <hi>necessity</hi> of it, from this very consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the <hi>divine Attributes,</hi> shall be argued in the process.</p>
               <p>Therefore, whoever concludes that <hi>God</hi> made not all <hi>souls</hi> of old, when he produced the world out of nothing, must confesse the reason of this assertion to be, because he <hi>would not.</hi> And then I would ask him, how he came to know what he affirms so boldly? Who acquainted him with the <hi>Divine Counsells?</hi> Is there a word said in his <hi>revealed will</hi> to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary?
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:53397:38"/>
or, hath he by his <hi>holy</hi> penmen told us that either of the other waies was more suitable to his <hi>beneplaciture?</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, 'tis very likely that a strong and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>phancy,</hi> possest with a perswasion of the falshood of this <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> might find some half phrases in <hi>scripture,</hi> which he might suborne to sing to the tune of his <hi>imagination.</hi> For, in such a <hi>Miscel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laneous</hi> piece as the <hi>Bible</hi> is, it will not be difficult for a man that's strongly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd against an opinion, to find some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what or other that may seem to him to speak the language of his <hi>phancy;</hi> And therefore it shall go hard, but that those whom their <hi>education</hi> or <hi>prejudice</hi> have ingaged against this <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> will light on some obscure pieces of <hi>texts,</hi> and broken sentences or other, that shall seem to condemn what they disapprove of. But I am securely confident, that there is not a sentence in the <hi>sacred volume,</hi> from end to end, that ever was intended to teach, that all <hi>souls</hi> were not <hi>made</hi> of <hi>old;</hi> or that, by a legitimate consequence, would inferre it. And if any there be
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:53397:39"/>
that seem to look another way, I dare say they are <hi>collateral,</hi> and were never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed by the <hi>divine</hi> Authors for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose they are made to serve, by the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of <hi>Praeexistence.</hi> Wherefore not to conceal any thing that with the least shew of probability can be pretended from the <hi>sacred volume</hi> in discountenance of the Doctrine of <hi>Praeexistence,</hi> I'le bring into view whatever I know to have the least face of a <hi>Testimony</hi> to the contrary, in the <hi>divine Revelations.</hi> That so, when it shall appear that the most specious <hi>Texts</hi> that can be alledg'd, have nothing at all in them to disprove the <hi>souls prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>existence,</hi> we may be secure that God hath not discovered to us in his <hi>written will,</hi> that 'twas not his <hi>pleasure</hi> to <hi>create</hi> all <hi>souls</hi> together.</p>
               <p>Therefore (I), It may be pretended, that the Doctrine of <hi>Praeexistence</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports not with that <hi>innocence</hi> and <hi>inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity</hi> in which the <hi>Scripture</hi> determines <hi>Adam</hi> to have been made. Since it sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth the <hi>descent</hi> into these <hi>bodyes</hi> to be a <hi>culpable lapse</hi> from an higher and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:53397:39"/>
state of <hi>Life,</hi> and this to be a state of <hi>incarceration</hi> for former <hi>delinquencies.</hi> To this I <hi>answer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">(1) No one can object any thing to purpose against <hi>Praeexistence</hi> from the <hi>unconceiveablenesse</hi> of it, untill he know the particular <hi>frame</hi> of the <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> without which, all <hi>impugnations</hi> rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the <hi>manner</hi> of the <hi>thing,</hi> will be wide of the mark, and but little to the businesse. Therefore, if the objectour would have patience to wait till we come to that part of our undertaking, he would find that there was but little ground for such a <hi>scruple.</hi> But however to prevent all cavillings, in this place i'le shew the <hi>invalidity</hi> of this <hi>objection.</hi> Wherefore,</p>
               <p n="2">(2) There is no necessity from the Doctrine of <hi>Praeexistence</hi> to suppose <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> a <hi>delinquent,</hi> before his noted <hi>trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression</hi> in a <hi>terrestrial</hi> body: for consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, that his <hi>body</hi> had vast <hi>advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> above ours, in point of <hi>beauty, puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and <hi>serviceablenesse</hi> to the soul, what harshness is there in conceiving that God
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:53397:40"/>
might send one of those <hi>immaculate Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi> that he had made, into such a Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that he might be his <hi>steward</hi> in the affairs of this <hi>lower Family;</hi> and an <hi>overseer,</hi> and <hi>ruler</hi> of those other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that he had order'd to have their dwelling upon earth. I am sure, there is no more contrariety to any of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Attributes</hi> in this <hi>supposition,</hi> then there is in that, which makes God to have sent a <hi>pure</hi> spirit, which he had <hi>just</hi> made, into such a <hi>body.</hi> Yea,</p>
               <p n="3">(3) Supposing that some <hi>souls fell,</hi> when the <hi>Angells</hi> did (which the process of our discourse will shew to be no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable supposition) this was a <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful provision</hi> of our <hi>Maker,</hi> and a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous undertaking for a <hi>Seraphick</hi> and <hi>untainted Spirit.</hi> For by this means, fit and congruous <hi>matter</hi> is prepared for those souls to reside and act in, who had rendred themselves unfit to <hi>live</hi> and <hi>injoy</hi> themselves in more <hi>refined bodyes.</hi> And so those spirits that had <hi>sinn'd</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into a state of <hi>silence</hi> and <hi>inactivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> are by this <hi>seasonable means,</hi> which
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:53397:40"/>
the <hi>divine Wisdome</hi> and <hi>Goodnesse</hi> hath contriv'd for them, put once more into a capacity of acting their parts anew, and comming into play again. Now if it seem hard to any to conceive how so noble a <hi>spirit</hi> in such an <hi>advantagious body,</hi> should have been impos'd upon by so gross a <hi>delusion,</hi> and submit so <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potently</hi> to the first <hi>temptation;</hi> He may please to consider, that the difficulty is the same, supposing him just then to have been <hi>made;</hi> if we grant him but that <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> and those great <hi>perfections</hi> both of <hi>will,</hi> and <hi>understanding,</hi> which <hi>orthodox theology</hi> allows him.</p>
               <p>Yea again (4) I might ask What <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience</hi> there is in supposing, that <hi>Adam</hi> himself was one of those <hi>delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent souls,</hi> which the divine <hi>pitty</hi> and <hi>compassion</hi> had thus set up again; that so, so many of his excellent creatures might not be lost and undone irrecoverabiy: but might act anew, though upon a low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er stage in the universe: A due conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the <hi>infinite foecundity</hi> and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the <hi>divine goodnesse</hi> will, if not
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:53397:41"/>
                  <hi>warrant,</hi> yet <hi>excuse</hi> such a <hi>supposition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now if it be demanded, What <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage Adam</hi>'s standing had been to his posterity, had he continued in the state of <hi>innocence;</hi> and how <hi>sin</hi> and <hi>misery</hi> is brought upon us by his <hi>Fall,</hi> according to this <hi>Hypothesis:</hi> I answer, that then among many other great priviledges, he had transsmitted downwards by way of natural <hi>generation</hi> that <hi>excellent</hi> and <hi>bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed temper</hi> of <hi>body;</hi> which should have been like his own <hi>happy crasis.</hi> So that our <hi>apprehensions</hi> should have been more <hi>large</hi> and <hi>free,</hi> our <hi>affections</hi> more <hi>regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi> and <hi>governable;</hi> and our <hi>inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> to what is good and vertuous, <hi>strong</hi> and <hi>vigorous.</hi> For we cannot but observe in this <hi>state,</hi> how vast an influence the temper of our <hi>bodyes</hi> hath upon our <hi>minds;</hi> both in reference to <hi>intellectual</hi> and <hi>moral dispositions.</hi> Thus, daily expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience teacheth us, how that, according to the <hi>ebb</hi> or <hi>flow</hi> of certain humours in our bodies, our witts are either more <hi>quick, free,</hi> and <hi>sparkling,</hi> or else more <hi>obtuse, weak,</hi> and <hi>sluggish.</hi> And we find
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:53397:41"/>
that there are certain <hi>clean</hi> and <hi>healthy</hi> dispositions of <hi>body</hi> which make us <hi>cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> and <hi>contented;</hi> others on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>

I might instance in allmost all other <hi>qualities</hi> of the <hi>mind,</hi> which are strangely influenc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and modifyed according to the bodie's <hi>constitution.</hi> But none will deny so plain a truth; and therefore I forbear to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist further on it. Nor need I mention any more <hi>advantages;</hi> so many, and such <hi>great</hi> ones, being consequent upon <hi>this.</hi> But our great <hi>Protoplast</hi> and <hi>representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> falling through his unhappy <hi>diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,</hi> besides the integrity and recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of his <hi>mind,</hi> he lost also that <hi>blessed constitution</hi> of <hi>Body,</hi> which would have been so great a priviledg to his <hi>off spring:</hi> so that it became now <hi>corrupt, weak,</hi> and <hi>indisposed</hi> for the nobler exercises of the soul; and he could transmit no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to us, then himself was owner of. Thus we <hi>fell in him,</hi> and were made <hi>miserable</hi> by his <hi>transgression.</hi> We have
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:53397:42"/>
bodies convey'd to us, which strangely do <hi>bewitch</hi> and <hi>betray</hi> us. And thus we all bear about us the marks of the <hi>first apostacy.</hi> There are other sad effects of his <hi>defection,</hi> but this may suffice for my present purpose. Thus we see how that the <hi>derivation</hi> of <hi>original depravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> from <hi>Adam</hi> is as clear in this <hi>Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis,</hi> as can be pretended in either of the other. And upon other Accounts it seems to have much the advantage of both of them. As will appear to the <hi>unprejudiced</hi> in what is further to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Finally,</hi> therefore, If the urgers of the <hi>Letter</hi> of <hi>Genesis</hi> of either side, against this <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> would but consider, <hi>That the souls that descend hither, for their prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varication in another state, lye in a long condition of silence and insensibility, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they appear in terrestrial bodies;</hi> each of them then might, from the doctrine of <hi>Praeexistence</hi> thus stated, gain all the <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages</hi> which he supposeth to have by his <hi>own opinion,</hi> and avoid all those <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities</hi> which he seeth the other run
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:53397:42"/>
upon. If the Assertours of <hi>daily Creation</hi> think it clear from Scripture that <hi>God is the Father of Spirits, and immediate ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of souls,</hi> they'l find the <hi>same</hi> made good and assented to in this <hi>Hypothesis.</hi> And if they are unwilling to hold—any thing contrary to the <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>soul,</hi> which is <hi>immortal</hi> and <hi>indiscerpible,</hi> the Doctrine of <hi>Praeexistence</hi> amicably clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth with them in this also.</p>
               <p>And if the Patrons of <hi>Traduction</hi> would have a way, how <hi>sin</hi> and <hi>misery</hi> may be <hi>propagated</hi> from our <hi>first Parent</hi> without aspersing the <hi>divine Attributes,</hi> or affirming any thing contrary to the <hi>phaenomena</hi> of <hi>Providence,</hi> and <hi>Nature;</hi> this <hi>Hypothesis</hi> will clear the businesse; It giving us so fair an Account how we all <hi>dye</hi> in <hi>Adam,</hi> without blotting the <hi>Wisdome, Justice,</hi> or <hi>Goodnesse</hi> of God, or affirming any thing contrary to the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances</hi> of <hi>Nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have been the longer on this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, because 'tis like to be one main <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection;</hi> And we see it is so far from pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicing, that it is no inconsiderable evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:53397:43"/>
of the <hi>truth</hi> of <hi>Praeexistence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now, besides this that I have na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, I cannot think of any <hi>Arguments</hi> from <hi>Scripture</hi> against this Doctrine, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable enough to excuse a mention of them. However, if the <hi>candid Reader</hi> will pardon the impertinency i'le present to view what I find most <hi>colourable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore (2), It may be some are so inadvertent as to urge against our <hi>souls</hi> having been of <hi>old,</hi> that, <hi>Sacred</hi> writ says <hi>We are but of Yesterday;</hi> which expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of <hi>divine Scripture,</hi> is question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse to be understood of our <hi>appearance</hi> on this <hi>stage</hi> of <hi>Earth.</hi> And is no more an <hi>Argument</hi> against our <hi>Praeexistence,</hi> then that other phrase of his, <hi>Before <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

Nor will it prove more the business it is brought for, then the expression of <hi>Rachels weeping for her Children because they were not,</hi> will inferre, that they were, <hi>absolutely nothing.</hi> Nor can any thing more be made.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) Of that place in <hi>Ecclesiastes, Yea</hi>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:53397:43"/>
                  <hi>better is he than both they,</hi> (meaning the <hi>dead</hi> and <hi>living</hi>) <hi>which hath not yet been;</hi> since, besides that 'tis a like <hi>scheme</hi> of <hi>speech</hi> with the former, it seems more to favour, then discountenance <hi>Praeexistence</hi> for what is <hi>absolutely nothing</hi> can neither be <hi>worse,</hi> nor <hi>better.</hi> Moreover, we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from a state of <hi>silence</hi> and <hi>inactivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> when we drop into <hi>these bodies,</hi> we were before, as if we had <hi>not been;</hi> and so there is better ground in this case, for such a manner of speaking, then in meer <hi>non-appearance;</hi> which yet scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture phraseth a <hi>Not being.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now I cannot think of any place in the <hi>sacred volume</hi> more that could make a tolerable plea against this <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis,</hi> of our <hi>souls</hi> having been before they came into these <hi>bodyes;</hi> except</p>
               <p n="4">(4) Any will draw a <hi>negative Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> from the <hi>History</hi> of the <hi>Creation,</hi> concluding that the <hi>Souls</hi> of men were not made of <hi>old,</hi> because there is no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there, of any such matter. To which I return briefly, That the same Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment concludes against the being of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells</hi>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:53397:44"/>
of whose <hi>creation</hi> there is no more say'd in the first <hi>story</hi> then of this <hi>inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi> rank of <hi>spirits, souls.</hi> The reason of which <hi>silence</hi> is commonly taken to be, because <hi>Moses</hi> had here to do with a rude and <hi>illiterate</hi> people, who had few or no apprehensions of any thing beyond their <hi>senses,</hi> and therefore he takes notice to them of nothing but what was <hi>sensible</hi> and of common observation. This reason is given also why <hi>minerals</hi> were omitted. 'Twere an easy matter, to shew how the outward <hi>cortex,</hi> the <hi>Letter</hi> of this <hi>Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> is adapted to mean and vulgar appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions, whose <hi>narrowness</hi> renders them incapable of <hi>sublimer speculations.</hi> But that being more then needs for our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent purpose, I shall forbear to speak further of it.</p>
               <p>I might (2) further adde, that great and learned <hi>Interpreters</hi> tell us, that all sorts of <hi>spirits, angels,</hi> and <hi>souls</hi> are <hi>sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolically</hi> meant by the <hi>creation</hi> of <hi>heaven,</hi> and <hi>light.</hi> And, if it were directly in the way of our present businesse, it might be made appear to be no improbable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture.
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:53397:44"/>
But I referre him that is curious in this particular to the great <hi>Restorer</hi> of the <hi>antient Cabbala,</hi> the Learned Dr. H. <hi>More</hi> in his <hi>conjectura Cabbalistica.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now from the consideration of the <hi>silence</hi> of the <hi>first History,</hi> we descend to the last and most likely to be urged <hi>scruple,</hi> which is to this purpose.</p>
               <p n="5">(5) We are not to step beyond the <hi>divine Revelations,</hi> and since God hath made known no such Doctrine as this, of the Souls <hi>Praeexistence</hi> any where in his word, we may reasonably deny it, or at least have no ground to imbrace it. This is the most important <hi>objection</hi> of all the rest, and most likely to prepos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess timerous and wary inquirers against this <hi>Hypothesis;</hi> wherefore I conceive that a full answer to this doubt, will prevent many scrupulous <hi>Haesitations,</hi> and make way for an unprejudic'd hearing of what I have further to alledg in the behalf of this <hi>opinion</hi> And</p>
               <p n="1">(1) I wish that those that urge <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture silence</hi> to disprove <hi>praeexistence</hi> would consider, how <hi>silent</hi> it is both in the case

of <hi>Daily Creation,</hi> and <hi>Traduction,</hi> we have seen already that there is nothing in <hi>Sacred</hi> writ to warrant either, but only such <hi>Generalls</hi> from which the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective Patrons</hi> of either Doctrine would inferre their own conclusion, though indeed they all of them with bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter right and congruity prove <hi>Praeex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">(2) I suppose those that argue from <hi>Scripture-silence</hi> in such cases mistake the design of <hi>Scripture,</hi> which is not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine <hi>points</hi> of <hi>speculation,</hi> but to be a <hi>rule</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Manners.</hi> Nor doth it otherwise design the teaching of <hi>Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals,</hi> then as they have a tendency to promote the <hi>divine</hi> life, <hi>righteousnesse,</hi> and <hi>Holinesse.</hi> It was never intended by it's <hi>inspired</hi> Authors to fill our <hi>Heads</hi> with <hi>notions,</hi> but to regulate our disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly <hi>appetites</hi> and <hi>affections,</hi> and to <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect</hi> us the <hi>way</hi> to a nobler <hi>happinesse.</hi> Therefore those that look for a <hi>systeme</hi> of <hi>opinions</hi> in those otherways-designed writings, do like him that should see for a body of natural Philosophy, in
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:53397:45"/>
                  <hi>Epictetus</hi> his <hi>moralls,</hi> or <hi>Seneca's Epistles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">(3) <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles</hi> spoke and writ as the condition of the persons with whom they dealt administred occasion, as did also the other <hi>Pen-men.</hi> Therefore doubtlesse there were many noble theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which they could have made the world acquainted with, which yet for want of a fit occasion to draw them forth were never upon Record. And we know, few <hi>speculative</hi> truths are deliver'd in <hi>Scripture,</hi> but such as were call'd forth by the <hi>controversies</hi> of those <hi>times:</hi> And <hi>Praeexistence</hi> was none of them, it being the constant opinion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> as appears by that Question, <hi>Master, was it for this man's sin or his Fathers, that he was born blind,</hi> which supposeth it of the <hi>Disciples</hi> also. Wherefore</p>
               <p n="4">(4) There was little need of more teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that, which those times were suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently instructed in: And indeed, as the case stands, if <hi>Scripture-silence</hi> be <hi>Argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> 'twil be for the advantage of <hi>Praeex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence;</hi> since it being the <hi>then common o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,</hi> and the <hi>disciples</hi> themselves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

of that belief 'tis very likely, had it been an errour, that Saviour <hi>Saviour</hi> or his <hi>Apostles</hi> would have witnest against it. But there being not a word let fall from them in disapprooval of that <hi>opinion,</hi> though sometimes occasions were admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred (as by the <hi>Question</hi> of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and some other occurrences) 'tis a good presumption of the soundnesse of it.</p>
               <p>Now that <hi>Praeexistence</hi> was the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon opinion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> in those times might be made good with full and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victive evidence, were it worth our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to insist much upon this Inquiry; but this being only a <hi>by consideration,</hi> a brief touch of it will suffice us. One of the great <hi>Rabbins</hi> therefore, Mr. <hi>Ben Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> in his <hi>Problems de Creatione,</hi> assures us, that <hi>Praeexistence</hi> was the <hi>common belief</hi> of all <hi>wise</hi> men among the <hi>Jews,</hi> without exception. And the <hi>Author</hi> of the Book of <hi>Wisdome,</hi> who certainly was a <hi>Jew,</hi> probably <hi>Philo,</hi> plainly sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth the same Doctrine in that Speech, <hi>For I was a witty Child, and had agood</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Reasons against <hi>Praeexistence</hi> answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Our <hi>forgetting</hi> the <hi>former state</hi> is no argument to disprove it: nor are the other Reasons that can be produc'd, more conclusive. The proof of the <hi>possibility</hi> of <hi>Praeex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence</hi> were enough, all other <hi>Hypotheses</hi> being absurd and contradictious. But it is prov'd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so by <hi>positive</hi> Arguments.</head>
               <p>NOw therefore to proceed, let us look back upon our progresse, and so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter on what remains; we have seen, that God <hi>could have created</hi> all <hi>souls at first had he so pleased,</hi> and <hi>that he hath revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led nothing in his written Will to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</hi> And now if it be found also, that he hath not made it known to our <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:53397:49"/>
that 'twas not his <hi>will</hi> to do <hi>so,</hi> we may conclude this first particular, <hi>That no one can say, that the Doctrine of Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>existence is a falshhood.</hi> Therefore let us call to Account the most momentous reasons that can be laid against it, and we shall find that they all have not <hi>weight</hi> enough in the least to move so <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional</hi> and <hi>solid</hi> an <hi>opinion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">(1) Then, 'tis likely to be urged, that had we <hi>lived</hi> and acted in a former state, we should doubtlesse have retain'd some <hi>remembrance</hi> of that <hi>condition;</hi> But we having no <hi>memory</hi> of any thing backwards before our appearance upon this <hi>present stage,</hi> it will be thought to be a consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable praesumption, that <hi>Praeexist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> is but a <hi>phancy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I would desire such kind of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners to tell me, how much they <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member</hi> of their <hi>state</hi> and condition in the <hi>womb,</hi> or of the <hi>Actions</hi> of their first <hi>infancy.</hi> And I could wish they would consider, that not one passage in an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred is <hi>remembred</hi> of their <hi>grown</hi> and <hi>ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> age. Nor doth there scarce a <hi>night</hi>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:53397:50"/>
passe but we <hi>dream</hi> of many things which our <hi>waking Memories</hi> can give us no Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of; yea <hi>old age</hi> and some kinds of <hi>diseases</hi> blot out all the <hi>images</hi> of things <hi>past,</hi> and even in this <hi>state</hi> cause a <hi>totall oblivion.</hi> Now if the <hi>Reasons</hi> why we should lose the <hi>remembrance</hi> of our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer life be <hi>greater,</hi> then are the <hi>causes</hi> of <hi>forgetfulnesse</hi> in the <hi>instances</hi> we have produced, I think it will be clear, that this Argument hath but little force a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>opinion</hi> we are inquiring into. Therefore if we do but reflect upon that long state of <hi>silence</hi> and <hi>inactivity</hi> that we emerged from, when we came into these bodies; and the <hi>vast change</hi> we under-went by our sinking into this new and unwonted <hi>habitation,</hi> it will appear to the considerate, that there is greater reason why we should have <hi>forgotten</hi> our former <hi>Life,</hi> then any thing in <hi>this.</hi> And if a <hi>disease</hi> or <hi>old age</hi> can rase out the <hi>memory</hi> of <hi>past actions,</hi> even while we are in one and the same <hi>condition</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> certainly so <hi>long</hi> and <hi>deep</hi> a <hi>swoon</hi> as is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute <hi>insensibility</hi> and <hi>inertnesse,</hi> may
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:53397:50"/>
much more reasonably be thought to blot our the <hi>memory</hi> of an <hi>other Life,</hi> whose passages probably were nothing like the <hi>transactions</hi> of <hi>this.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this also might be given as an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reason of our forgetting our former <hi>state,</hi> since usually things are brought to our <hi>remembrance</hi> by some <hi>like occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences.</hi> But</p>
               <p n="2">(2) Some will argue, If <hi>this</hi> be a state of <hi>punishment</hi> for <hi>former</hi> misearriages how comes it about then, that 'tis a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter condition then that we last came from <hi>viz.</hi> the state of <hi>silence</hi> and <hi>insensibility.</hi> I answer, That if we look upon our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent <hi>terrestrial</hi> condition an an effect of our <hi>defection</hi> from the <hi>higher Life,</hi> and in reference to our former happinesse lost by our own default, 'tis then a <hi>misery,</hi> and a <hi>punishment.</hi> But if we compare our <hi>now-being</hi> with the state of <hi>inactivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> we were deliver'd from, It may then be call'd an <hi>After-Game of</hi> the <hi>divine Goodnesse,</hi> and a Mercy. As a <hi>Malefactor,</hi> that is at first put into a dark and discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solate dungeon, and afterwards is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:53397:51"/>
to a more comfortable and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some prison, may acknowledge his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move to be a <hi>favour</hi> and <hi>deliverance</hi> compared with the <hi>place</hi> he was last con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to; though with respect to his <hi>fault</hi> and former <hi>liberty,</hi> even this condition is both a <hi>mulct</hi> and a <hi>misery.</hi> It is just thus in the present case, and any one may make the application.</p>
               <p>But it will be said, (3) If our <hi>souls</hi> liv'd in a <hi>former state</hi> did they <hi>act</hi> in <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> or without them? The former they'l say is absurd, and the latter incongruous and unlikely; since then all the <hi>powers</hi> the soul hath to exert in a body, would have been <hi>idle</hi> and to no purpose. But (1) the most that can be argued from such like <hi>objections,</hi> is, that we know not the <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> of the <hi>thing;</hi> and are no Arguments against the assertion it self. And were it granted that the <hi>particular state</hi> of the <hi>soul</hi> before it came hither is <hi>inconceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> yet this makes no more against it, then it doth against it's <hi>after-condition;</hi> which these very <hi>objectors</hi> hold to be so, as to the <hi>particular modus.</hi> But
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:53397:51"/>
(a) Why is it so absurd that the soul should have <hi>actuated</hi> another kind of <hi>body,</hi> before it came into <hi>this?</hi> Even <hi>here</hi> 'tis <hi>immediately</hi> united to a purer <hi>vehi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,</hi> moves and acts the grosser body by it; And why then might it not in its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and <hi>purer state</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> have been join'd only to such a <hi>refined body,</hi> which should have been suitable to its own <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> and <hi>purity?</hi> I'me sure, many, if not the most of the <hi>Antient Fathers</hi> thought <hi>Angells</hi> themselves to be <hi>embo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyed,</hi> and therefore they reputed not <hi>this</hi> such a grosse absurdity. But an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion hereafter will draw our pen this way again, and therefore I pass it to a third return to this <hi>objection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">(3) Therefore, though it were granted that the <hi>soul</hi> lived afore-times without a <hi>body,</hi> what greater <hi>incongruity</hi> is there in such a <hi>supposition,</hi> then that it should <hi>live</hi> and <hi>act</hi> after <hi>death</hi> without any uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with <hi>matter</hi> or any <hi>body</hi> whatsoever, as the <hi>objectors</hi> themselves conceive it doth? But all such objections as these will fly away as mists before the sun,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:53397:52"/>
when we shall come particularly to state the <hi>Hypothesis.</hi> And therefore I may be excused from further troubling my self and the Reader about them here. Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially since, as hath been intimated, they prove nothing at all, but that the objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors cannot conceive vvhat manner of state that of <hi>Praeexistence</hi> was, which is no prejudice to the opinion it self; that <hi>our souls were extant before these earthly bodies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus then I hope I have clearly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough made good <hi>that all souls might have been created from the beginning;</hi> for ought any thing that is made known, either in the <hi>Scriptures</hi> or our <hi>reasons</hi> to the contrary. And thereby have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd those <hi>prejudices</hi> that would have stood in the way of our <hi>conclusion.</hi> Wherefore we may now without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul, from our proof of, <hi>That it may be so,</hi> pass on to enquire, whether indeed <hi>it is so;</hi> and see, whether it may as well be <hi>asserted,</hi> as <hi>defended.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And truly considering that both the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ways are <hi>impossible,</hi> and this <hi>third</hi>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:53397:52"/>
not at all <hi>unreasonable,</hi> it may be thought needlesse to bring more forces into the field to gain it the victory, after its ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies are quite scattered and defeated. Yet however, for the <hi>pomp</hi> and <hi>triumph</hi> of truth, though it need not their service we shall add some <hi>positive</hi> Arguments, whereby it may appear, that not only all other ways are <hi>dangerous</hi> and <hi>unpas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable,</hi> and <hi>this irreproveable;</hi> but also that there is <hi>direct</hi> evidence enough to prove it <hi>solid</hi> and <hi>rational.</hi> And I make my first consideration of this kind, a <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Argument.</hi>

               <p n="2">(2) THen, whoever conceives rightly of <hi>God,</hi> apprehends him to be <hi>infinite</hi> and <hi>immense Goodnesse,</hi> who is alwaies shedding abroad of his own <hi>exu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berant fulnesse:</hi> There is no <hi>straightness</hi> in the <hi>Deity,</hi> no <hi>bounds</hi> to the <hi>ocean</hi> of <hi>Love.</hi> Now the <hi>divine Goodnesse</hi> referrs not to himself, as ours <hi>extends not unto him.</hi> He acts nothing for any <hi>self-ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment,</hi> being <hi>essentially</hi> and <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely compleat</hi> and <hi>perfect.</hi> But the object and term of his <hi>goodnesse</hi> is his creatures <hi>good</hi> and happinesse, in their respective capacities. He is that infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite <hi>fountain</hi> that is continually <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing;</hi>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:53397:53"/>
and can no more cease to shed his <hi>influences</hi> upon his <hi>indigent depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents</hi> then the <hi>sun</hi> to shine at <hi>noon.</hi> Now as the <hi>infinite Goodnesse</hi> of the deity, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth him alwaies to do <hi>good,</hi> so by the same reason to do that which is <hi>best;</hi> since to omit any degrees of <hi>good</hi> would ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue a <hi>defect</hi> in <hi>goodnesse,</hi> supposing <hi>wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> to <hi>order,</hi> and <hi>power</hi> to <hi>execute.</hi> He therefore that supposeth <hi>God</hi> not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies to do what is <hi>best,</hi> and <hi>best</hi> for his <hi>Creatures</hi> (for he cannot act for his own <hi>Good</hi>) apprehends him to be lesse <hi>good</hi> then can be <hi>conceived,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently not <hi>infinitely so.</hi> For what is <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite,</hi> is beyond <hi>measure</hi> and <hi>apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore to direct this to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, <hi>God</hi> being <hi>infinitely good</hi> and that to his <hi>Creatures,</hi> and therefore doing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies what is <hi>best</hi> for them, methinks it roundly follows that our <hi>souls lived</hi> and injoy'd themselves of <hi>old</hi> before they came into these <hi>bodies.</hi> For since they were <hi>capable</hi> of <hi>living</hi> and that in a much <hi>better</hi> and <hi>happier</hi> state long before they
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:53397:54"/>
descended into this <hi>region</hi> of <hi>death</hi> and <hi>misery;</hi> and since that condition of <hi>life</hi> and <hi>self-enjoyment</hi> would have been <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> then <hi>absolute not-being,</hi> may we not safely conclude from a due consideration of the <hi>divine goodnesse,</hi> that it was <hi>so?</hi> What was it that gave us our <hi>being,</hi> but the <hi>immense goodnesse</hi> of our <hi>Maker?</hi> And why were we drawn out of our <hi>nothings</hi> but because it was <hi>better</hi> for us to <hi>be,</hi> then <hi>not</hi> to <hi>be?</hi> Why were our <hi>souls</hi> put into <hi>these bodies,</hi> and not into some more <hi>squallid</hi> and <hi>ugly;</hi> but because we are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of <hi>such,</hi> and 'tis <hi>better</hi> for us to <hi>live</hi> in <hi>these,</hi> then in those that are lesse sutable to our natures? And had it not been <hi>better</hi> for us, to have injoy'd our selves and the bounty and favours of our <hi>Maker</hi> of old, as did the other order of <hi>intellectual</hi> creatures; then to have layn in the comfortless <hi>night</hi> of <hi>nothing</hi> till 'tother day! Had we not been <hi>better</hi> on't to have lived and acted in the joyful regions of light and blessednesse with those spirits that at first had being, then just now to jump into this sad plight,

               <p>I confesse, the world generally have such <hi>narrow</hi> and <hi>unbecomming apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and draw his <hi>picture</hi> in their <hi>imaginations</hi> so like themselves, that few I doubt will feel the <hi>force</hi> of this <hi>Argument;</hi> and mine own observation makes me enter the same suspicion of

                  <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> This first <hi>Evasion,</hi> that God acts <hi>freely,</hi> and his <hi>meere will</hi> is reason enough for his doing, or forbearing any thing, overthrown by four Considerations. Some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident Evasions, <hi>viz.</hi> that Gods <hi>wisdome,</hi> or his <hi>glory,</hi> may be contrary to this display of the divine <hi>goodnesse,</hi> in our being made of old, clearly taken off.</head>
               <p n="1">(1) THerefore, will some say, God worketh <hi>freely,</hi> nor can he be <hi>oblig'd</hi> to <hi>act</hi> but when he <hi>pleaseth.</hi> And this <hi>will</hi> and <hi>pleasure</hi> of his is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of our <hi>beings,</hi> and of the <hi>determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> time of our <hi>beginning.</hi> Therefore if <hi>God</hi> would not that we should have been made <hi>sooner,</hi> and in a <hi>better</hi> state
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:53397:56"/>
of life, his <hi>will</hi> is <hi>reason</hi> enough and we need look no further. To this evasion, I thus Reply.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) 'Tis true indeed, <hi>God</hi> is the most <hi>Free Agent,</hi> because none can <hi>compell</hi> him to <hi>act,</hi> none can <hi>hinder</hi> him from <hi>acting.</hi> Nor can his creatures oblige him to any thing. But then</p>
               <p n="2">(2) The <hi>divine liberty</hi> and <hi>freedome</hi> consists not in his acting by meer <hi>arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious will</hi> as disujnct from his other <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes.</hi> For he is sayd to <hi>act</hi> according to the <hi>counsell</hi> of his own <hi>will.</hi> So that his <hi>wisdome</hi> and <hi>goodness</hi> are as it were the <hi>Rules</hi> whereby his <hi>will</hi> is directed. Therefore though he cannot be <hi>obliged</hi> to act by any thing <hi>without himself,</hi> yet he may by the <hi>Laws</hi> of his own <hi>essential rectitude</hi> and <hi>perfection.</hi> Wherefore I conceive he is said, <hi>not to be able to do</hi> those things (which he might well enough by <hi>absolute power</hi>) that consist not with his <hi>ever blessed Attributes.</hi> Nor by the same reason can he <hi>omit</hi> that which the <hi>eternal Law</hi> of his most perfect nature <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap>geth</hi> him to. The summe is, <hi>God</hi> never
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:53397:56"/>
                  <hi>Acts</hi> by <hi>meer will</hi> or <hi>groundlesse humour, that</hi> is a <hi>weaknesse</hi> in his <hi>imperfect</hi> crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; but according to the <hi>immutable Rules</hi> of his ever blessed <hi>essence.</hi> And therefore,</p>
               <p n="3">(3) Tis a derogation from his <hi>infinite Majesty</hi> to assert any thing contrary to his <hi>Goodnesse</hi> upon pretence of his <hi>will</hi> and <hi>pleasure.</hi> For whatever is most sute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to this most blessed <hi>Attribute,</hi> and contradicts no other, <hi>that</hi> be sure he <hi>willeth.</hi> Wherefore</p>
               <p n="4">(4) If it be <hi>better,</hi> and more <hi>agreeable</hi> to the <hi>divine goodnesse</hi> that we should have been in an <hi>happier</hi> state, before we came into these <hi>bodies, Gods will</hi> cannot then be pretended to the contrary, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially it having been proved already, that he hath no way <hi>revealed</hi> any such <hi>will</hi> of his) but rather it is demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively clear that his <hi>will</hi> was, <hi>it should be so.</hi> Since as God never acts in the absence of his <hi>wisdome</hi> and <hi>goodnesse,</hi> so neither doth he abstain from acting when those great <hi>Attributes</hi> require it.</p>
               <p>Now if it be excepted again (2) That
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:53397:57"/>
'tis true that this <hi>Hypothesis</hi> is most suta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the <hi>divine goodnesse</hi> and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of that alone would inferre it. But how know we but his <hi>Wisdome</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts it. I return briefly, That if it be confest to be so correspondent to, and inferrible from one <hi>Attribute,</hi> and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be prov'd <hi>inconsistent</hi> with another, my businesse is determin'd. Therefore let those that pretend an inconsistence, prove it. (2) The <hi>wisdome</hi> of God is that Attribute and <hi>essential perfection,</hi> whereby the <hi>divine</hi> actions are <hi>directed</hi> to their <hi>end,</hi> which is alwaies <hi>good,</hi> and <hi>best:</hi> Therefore to do that which is <hi>best</hi> cannot thwart the <hi>divine wisdome,</hi> but alwaies includes and supposeth it. Whence it follows, that what <hi>so</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports with <hi>goodnesse,</hi> cannot stand oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to <hi>Wisdome.</hi> Wisdome in <hi>God</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing indeed nothing else but <hi>goodnesse,</hi> contriving and directing for the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's <hi>good</hi> and happinesse. For we must remember, what was said above, that <hi>what is infinitely full and perfect, can have no ends for any self-advantage;</hi> and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:53397:57"/>
therefore the <hi>ends</hi> of the <hi>divine wisdome</hi> are somthing <hi>without himself,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently <hi>the good and perfection</hi> of his <hi>creatures.</hi> So that unlesse it can be prov'd to have been contrary to <hi>ours,</hi> or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creatures <hi>good,</hi> that we should have been extant as soon as the <hi>Light,</hi> it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be concluded to have any <hi>contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to the <hi>divine wisdome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it will be said again (3) <hi>Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> is his great end, for the promoting of which his wisdome <hi>directs</hi> all his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and consequently, that which may be <hi>best</hi> for the <hi>creature,</hi> may not be so conducive to the <hi>divine Glory,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not agreeable with his <hi>wisdome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now though I think the world hath a very mistaken apprehension of <hi>Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> yet I shall not here ingage in more controversies, then I must needs. Tis e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for my present purpose to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate; That <hi>Gods glory</hi> is no <hi>by-end</hi> or <hi>self-accumulation,</hi> nor an <hi>addition</hi> of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing to Him which he was not eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally possest of; nor yet is it any thing that stands in opposition to the <hi>good</hi> of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:53397:58"/>
his <hi>creation:</hi> But the <hi>display</hi> and <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of his excellencies;</hi> among the which, his <hi>goodnesse</hi> is not the least considerable, if it be not that most <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi> and <hi>fundamental Attribute</hi> which <hi>gives perfection to all the rest.</hi> So that we may assure our selves, that when ever his <hi>goodness</hi> obligeth him to action, his <hi>glory</hi> never stands in <hi>opposition.</hi> For even this is his <hi>glory</hi> to <hi>communicate</hi> to his creatures sutably to his own <hi>absolute fulness,</hi> and to act according to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of his <hi>essential perfections,</hi> yea, though we should state his <hi>glory</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist alone, in the <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>renown</hi> of his Attributes, yet even then the <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis</hi> of our having been made in the <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning</hi> will accumulate to his <hi>praises,</hi> and represent him to his creatures as more <hi>illustrious;</hi> since it is a more <hi>mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent apprehension</hi> of his <hi>goodnesse,</hi> and cleares his other <hi>Attributes</hi> from those stains of dis-repute that all other suppositions cast upon them. And though his <hi>glory</hi> should consist, as too many fondly imagine, in being <hi>praised</hi> and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:53397:58"/>
red by his <hi>creatures,</hi> even on this account also it would have obliged him to have <hi>made us all of old,</hi> rather then opposed it; since, then, his excellencies had been sung forth by a more numerous <hi>Quire,</hi> in continual <hi>Hallelujahs.</hi> Now if it should be urged, that <hi>God made all things for himself,</hi> and therefore is not obliged to consult the <hi>good</hi> of his creatures in all his Actions. I rejoin, that <hi>God's making all things for himself,</hi> can argue no more then his making all things for his own <hi>ends, viz.</hi> the <hi>ends</hi> of <hi>goodnesse.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, the best <hi>Criticks</hi> make that place to speak no more but this, That <hi>God or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> all things <hi>according</hi> to <hi>himself;</hi> that is, according to the rules of his own <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>perfections.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus then we see that for <hi>God</hi> to do that which is <hi>best</hi> for his creatures, is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther contrary to his <hi>will</hi> and <hi>pleasure,</hi> his <hi>wisdome,</hi> nor his <hi>glory,</hi> but most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant to all of them. And therefore since the <hi>Praeexistence</hi> of <hi>Souls,</hi> is so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the divine <hi>goodnesse,</hi> and since nothing else in the <hi>Deity</hi> opposeth,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:53397:59"/>
but rather sweetly conspires with it, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks this argument were enough to conclude it. But yet there are other <hi>Ev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

vast fetches in the <hi>divine wisdome</hi> which we comprehend not, nor can our <hi>natural light</hi> determine what is best. I answer (1) Our Saviour himself, who was the best Judge in the case, teacheth us, that the Reason of a man may in some things conclude what <hi>God will do</hi> in that saying of his, <hi>If ye being evill, know how to give good things to your Children, much more shall your Father which is in Heaven give his Spirit to them that ask him.</hi> Plainly intimating, that we may securely argue from any thing that is a <hi>perfection</hi> in our selves, to the same in <hi>God.</hi> And if we, who are <hi>imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly good,</hi> will yet do as much <hi>good</hi> as we can, for those we <hi>love</hi> and <hi>tender;</hi> with greater confidence may we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that <hi>God</hi> who is <hi>infinitely so,</hi> will conferre upon his <hi>creatures</hi> whatever <hi>good</hi> they are capable of. Thus we see our <hi>Saviour</hi> ownes the capacity of <hi>reason</hi> in a case that is very near the same that we are dealing in.</p>
               <p>And God himself appeals to the <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> of men to judge of the <hi>righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:53397:60"/>
and <hi>equity</hi> of his ways. <hi>Ye men of</hi> Israel <hi>and inhabitants of</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>judg between me and my vineyard,</hi> which place I bring to shew that meer natural <hi>reason</hi> is able to judge in some cases <hi>what is fit for God to do,</hi> and what is sutable to his <hi>essence</hi> and <hi>perfections.</hi> And if in <hi>any,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Methinks (2) its <hi>capacity</hi> in the case before us should be own'd as soon as in any. For if <hi>reason</hi> cannot determine and assure us, that a <hi>blessed</hi> and <hi>happy Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> is <hi>better</hi> then <hi>None</hi> at all; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently, that it was <hi>best</hi> for our souls to have been, before they were in this <hi>state</hi> of <hi>wretchedness;</hi> and thence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that it was very congruous to the <hi>divine goodness</hi> to have made us in a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and better condition; I think then (1) That <hi>it</hi> cannot give us the assurance of any thing, since there is not any prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple in <hi>metaphysicks</hi> or <hi>geometry</hi> more clear then this, viz. <hi>

vain are those Learned men that dispute whether a state of the extremest <hi>misery</hi> a creature is capable of, and that <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting,</hi> be not <hi>better</hi> then <hi>Non-entity.</hi> (2) If we cannot certainly know that it had been <hi>Better</hi> that we should have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted in a life of happiness, proportion'd to our natures of old, then have been meer <hi>nothing,</hi> till some few years since; we can never then own or acknowledg the <hi>divine goodness</hi> to us in any thing we injoy.

               <p>I say then, and it may serve for a (3) answer to the <hi>general objection.</hi> If we may deny that to be done by <hi>almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty goodness,</hi> which is undoubtedly <hi>best</hi> for a whole <hi>species</hi> of his creatures, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on this account, that, for ought we know, it may be for the advantage of some others, though there be not the least appearance of any such matter; we can never then argue any thing from the <hi>divine goodness.</hi> It can never then be prov'd from that <hi>glorious Attribute,</hi> that he hath not made some of his creatures <hi>on purpose</hi> that they might be <hi>miserable;</hi> nor can it be concluded thence, that he will not <hi>annihilate</hi> all the <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>spot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less</hi> angells; both which I suppose, any sober inquirer will think congruously de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible from the <hi>divine goodness.</hi> And if to say, <hi>for ought we know,</hi> It may be <hi>best</hi> for some other creatures, that those should be <hi>miserable,</hi> and these <hi>annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:53397:61"/>
be enough to disable the Argument; on the same account we shall never be able to prove ought from <hi>this,</hi> or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Attribute.</hi> I might adde,</p>
               <p n="2">(2) There is not the least coloura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble pretence for any such suspicion. For, would the <hi>world</hi> have been too little to have contain'd those <hi>souls,</hi> without just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with some others? or, would they by violence have taken any of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of the other intellectual crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures from them?

               </p>
               <p n="3">(3) If this be enough to answer an <hi>Argument,</hi> to say, <hi>for ought we know, it may be thus and thus,</hi> when there is not the least sign or appearance of any such thing, then <hi>nothing</hi> can ever be <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi> and we are condemned to <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Scepticism.</hi> We should never for instance, from the <hi>order, beauty,</hi> and

If this be <hi>answering,</hi> any thing might be <hi>answered.</hi> But there is yet ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>objection</hi> against mine <hi>Argument</hi> from the divine <hi>goodnesse</hi> which looks ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry formidably at a distance, though when we come near it, we shall find, it will not bear the tryall. And it may thus be urged.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) If the <hi>goodnesse</hi> of God always ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth him to do what is <hi>best,</hi> and <hi>best</hi> for his <hi>Creatures,</hi> How is it then, that we were not made <hi>impeccable,</hi> and so not <hi>obnoxious</hi> to <hi>misery?</hi> Or how doth it consist with that overflowing <hi>goodness</hi> of the <hi>Deity,</hi> that we were let to lye in a long state of <hi>silence</hi> and <hi>insensibility,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we came into these bodies? This seems a pressing difficulty, but yet there's hopes we may dispatch it. Therefore,</p>

(1) Had we been made <hi>impeccable,</hi> we should have been another kind of creatures then now; since we had then wanted the <gap reason="foreign">

But it will be ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged upon us, If <hi>Liberty</hi> to <hi>good</hi> and <hi>evil</hi> be so essential to our natures, what think we then of the <hi>blessed</hi> souls after the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection;</hi> are not they the same <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> though vvithout the <hi>liberty</hi> of <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning?</hi>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:53397:63"/>
To return to this; I think those that affirm, that, the blessed have not this <hi>natural liberty</hi> as long as they are united to a <hi>body,</hi> and are capable of resenting it's <hi>pleasures,</hi> should do well to prove it. Indeed they may be <hi>morally immutable</hi> and <hi>illapsable:</hi> but this is <hi>grace,</hi> not <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> a reward of <hi>obedience,</hi> not a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary <hi>annex</hi> of our <hi>Beings.</hi> But will it be said, why did not the divine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse endue us all with this <hi>morall stabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity?</hi> Had it not been better for us to have been made in this condition of <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity,</hi> then in a state so <hi>dangerous?</hi> My return to this doubt will be a second An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to the main <hi>objection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore <hi>Secondly,</hi> I doubt not, but that 'tis much <hi>better</hi> for <hi>rational</hi> crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that this supream happiness should be the <hi>Reward</hi> of <hi>vertue,</hi> rather then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:53397:63"/>
in the things we were <hi>born</hi> to. And had we been made secure from <hi>sin,</hi> and <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery</hi> from the first moment of our <hi>Being,</hi> we should not have put so high a <hi>rate</hi> and <hi>value</hi> upon that priviledge.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) Had we been at first establisht in an <hi>impossibility</hi> of <hi>lapsing</hi> into <hi>evill;</hi> Then many choise <hi>vertu's,</hi> excellent branches of the <hi>divine Life</hi> had never been exercis'd, or indeed have been at all.

For <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi> is a kind of <hi>victory,</hi> and supposeth a <hi>conflict.</hi> Therefore we say, that God is <hi>good</hi> and <hi>holy,</hi> but not <hi>vertuous.</hi> Take away a <hi>possibility</hi> of <hi>evill,</hi> and in the <hi>creature</hi> there is no <hi>morall</hi> goodnesse.

Therefore in summe (5ly), The <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine goodnesse</hi> is manifested in making all creatures sutably to those <hi>Id<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It lopps not off <hi>essential Attributes</hi> of some <hi>beings,</hi> to <hi>inoculate</hi> them upon others: But, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly comprehending all things, assigns each <hi>Being</hi> it's proper <hi>nature,</hi> and <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities.</hi> And the <hi>Divine goodnesse,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <hi>wise</hi> direction of the <hi>eternal intellect,</hi> in like distinct and orderly man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner produceth all things: <hi>viz.</hi> according to all the variety of their respective <hi>idea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> in the <hi>divine</hi> wisdome.

a rational <hi>soul,</hi> or every <hi>soul,</hi> an impec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable <hi>Angell.</hi> For this were to tye him to <hi>contradictions.</hi> Since therefore, such an order of <hi>Beings,</hi> as <hi>rational</hi> and <hi>hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,</hi> though <hi>free,</hi> and therefore <hi>mutable,</hi> creatures, were distinctly comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the <hi>divine Wisdome;</hi> It was an effect of God's <hi>Goodness,</hi> to bring them into being, even in such a condition, and in such manner, as in their <hi>eternal idae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> they were represented.</p>
               <p>Thus then we see, it is not contrary to the infinite <hi>plenitude</hi> of the <hi>divine goodness</hi> that we should have been made <hi>peccable</hi> and lyable to <hi>defection.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus in our very essential constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <hi>lapsable;</hi> 'twas no defect in the goodnesse of our Maker that he did not interpose by his absolute <hi>omnipotence</hi> to prevent our actual <hi>praevarication</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postacy.</hi> Since his goodnesse obligeth him not to secure us upon any terms what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, but upon such, as may most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the general <hi>good</hi> &amp; advantage. And questionless, 'twas much better that such, as would <hi>wilfully</hi> depart from the laws
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:53397:65"/>
of their blessed natures, and break through all restraints of the divine commands, should feel the smart of their <hi>disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;</hi> then that <hi>providence</hi> should dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order the constitution of nature to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the punishment, which they drew upon themselves: Since those <hi>apostate</hi> spirits, remain instances to those that stand, of the <hi>divine justice,</hi> and <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity</hi> against <hi>sinners,</hi> and so may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute not a little to their <hi>Security.</hi> And for that long <hi>night</hi> of <hi>silence,</hi> in which multitudes of souls are buried before they descend into <hi>terrestrial matter,</hi> it is but the due reward of their former disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; for which, considering the <hi>happy circumstances</hi> in which they were made, they deserv'd to be <hi>nothing</hi> for ever.

               </p>
               <p>Thus then we see, That Gods making us <hi>lapsable</hi> and permitting us to <hi>fall,</hi> is no prejudice in the least to the infinite

               <p n="1">(1) Every one that believes the <hi>infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niteness</hi> of Gods <hi>goodness</hi> is as much ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to answer this <hi>objection,</hi> as I am. For it will be said, <hi>infinite goodness</hi> doth <hi>good infinitely,</hi> and consequently the <hi>effects</hi> to which it doth <hi>communicate</hi> are <hi>infinite.</hi> For if they are not so, it might have <hi>communicated</hi> to more, and thereby have done more <hi>good</hi> then now 'tis sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to do, and by consequence now is not <hi>infinite.</hi> And to affirm that good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is <hi>infinite,</hi> where what it doth and intends to do is but <hi>finite,</hi> will be said to be a <hi>contradiction,</hi> since <hi>goodness</hi> is a <hi>relative</hi> term, and in God always res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects somewhat <hi>ad extra.</hi> For he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be said to be <hi>good</hi> to himself, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a nature that can receive no <hi>additio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal perfection.</hi> Wherefore this <hi>Objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>

Yea (2ly.) the Scripture affirms that which is the very strength of mine Argument, <hi>viz.</hi> That God made all things best; <hi>Very Good,</hi> saith our Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation: but the <hi>Original,</hi>

Let me only adde this, That 'tis more becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming us, to inlarge our <hi>apprehensions</hi> of things so, as that they may suit the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Beneficence,</hi> then to draw <hi>it</hi> down to a complyance with our <hi>narrow schemes,</hi> and <hi>narrow modells.</hi>

Thus then I have done with the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument</hi> for <hi>Praeexistence</hi> drawn from the <hi>Divine goodnesse.</hi> And I have been the longer on it, because I thought 'twas in vain to propose it, without taking to task the <hi>principal</hi> of those <hi>objections,</hi> that must needs arise in the minds of those that are not used to this <hi>way</hi> of <hi>arguing.</hi> And while there was no provision made to stop up those <hi>Evasions,</hi> that I saw this <hi>Argument</hi> obnoxious to; the using of it, I was afraid, would have been a <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice,</hi> rather then a <hi>furtherance</hi> of the <hi>cause</hi> I ingaged it in.

aptly suit with the doctrine of its <hi>praeex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence:</hi> which gives a most clear and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite account of the <hi>phaenomenon.</hi> For let us but conceive the souls of men to have grown <hi>degenerate</hi> in a former <hi>condition</hi> of <hi>life,</hi> to have contracted strong and inveterate <hi>habits</hi> to vice and Iewdnesse, and that in various manners and degrees; we may then easily apprehend, when some mens <hi>natures</hi> had so incredibly a <hi>depraved tincture,</hi> and such <hi>impetuous, ungovernable, irreclaimiable inclinations</hi> to what is vitious; while others have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing near such wretched propensions, but by good <hi>education</hi> and good <hi>disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline</hi> are <hi>mouldable</hi> to <hi>vertue.</hi> This shews a clear way to <hi>unriddle</hi> this <hi>ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing mystery,</hi> without <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>lemishing any of the <hi>divine Attributes,</hi> or doing the least <hi>violence</hi> to our <hi>faculties.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor is it more difficult to conceive, how a <hi>soul</hi> should awaken out of the <hi>state</hi> of <hi>inactivity</hi> we speak of, with those <hi>radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal inclinations</hi> that by long practice it had contracted, then how a <hi>Swallow</hi> should return to her old trade of living
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:53397:69"/>
after her winter <hi>sleep</hi> and <hi>silence;</hi> for those <hi>customs</hi> it hath been addicted to in the other state, are now so deeply fastned and rooted in the <hi>soul,</hi> that they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come even <hi>another nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now then, if <hi>Praeexistence</hi> be not the truth, 'tis very strange that it should so exactly answer the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, when as no other <hi>Hypothesis</hi> doth any whit tolerably suit them. And if we may conclude that false, which is so correspondent to all <hi>appearances,</hi> when we know nothing else that can yield any probable account of them, and which is not in the least <hi>repugnant</hi> to any <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement</hi> of belief, we then strangely forget our selves when we <hi>determine</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing. We can never for instance, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the <hi>Moon</hi> to be the cause of the <hi>flux</hi> and <hi>reflux</hi> of the Sea, from the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering of her <hi>approaches</hi> and <hi>recesses</hi> to its <hi>ebbs</hi> and <hi>swellings.</hi> Nor at this rate can the cause of any thing else be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd in nature.</p>
               <p>But yet besides. (2) we might another way inforce this <hi>Argument,</hi> from the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:53397:69"/>
strange difference and diversity that there is in mens <hi>wits</hi> and <hi>intellectual craseis,</hi> as well as in the dispositions of their <hi>wills</hi> and <hi>appetites.</hi> Even the natural tempers of mens <hi>minds</hi> are as vastly different, as the <hi>qualities</hi> of their <hi>bodys.</hi> And 'tis ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy to observe in things purely <hi>speculative</hi> and <hi>intellectual,</hi> even where neither <hi>edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> or <hi>custom</hi> have interposed to sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticate the natural <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Every <hi>soul</hi> brings a kind of <hi>sense</hi> with it into the world, whereby it <hi>tastes</hi> and <hi>relisheth</hi> what is suitable to its peculiar <hi>temper.</hi> And <hi>notions</hi> will never lye easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in a mind, that they are not fitted to; some can never apprehend <hi>that</hi> for other then an <hi>Absurdity,</hi> which others are so

clear in, that they almost take it for a <hi>First principle.</hi> And yet the former hath all the same evidence as the latter. This I have remarkably taken notice of, in the opinion of the <hi>extension</hi> of a <hi>spirit.</hi> Some that I know, and those <hi>inquisi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Nor can they conceive any thing <hi>extended</hi> but as a <hi>Body.</hi> Whereas other deep and impartial searchers into nature, cannot apprehend <hi>it</hi> anything at all, if not <hi>extended;</hi> but think it must then be a <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical point,</hi> or a meer non-entity.</p>
               <p>I could instance in other speculations, which I have observ'd some to be passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate Embracers of upon the first propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal; when as no arguments could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail on others, to think them tolerable. But there needs no proof of a manifest observation.</p>
               <p>Therefore before I goe further, I would demand, whence comes this meer <hi>notional</hi> or <hi>speculative variety:</hi> were this <hi>difference</hi> about <hi>sensibles,</hi> yea or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout things depending on the <hi>imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:53397:70"/>
the <hi>influence</hi> of the body might then be suspected for a <hi>cause.</hi> But since it is in the most <hi>abstracted Theories</hi> that have nothing to do with the grosser <hi>phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasmes;</hi> since this <hi>diversity</hi> is found in <hi>minds</hi> that have the greatest care to free themselves from the <hi>deceptions</hi> of <hi>sense,</hi> and intanglements of the body, what can we conclude, but that the soul it self is the <hi>immediate</hi> subject of all this <hi>variety,</hi> and that it came <hi>praejudiced</hi> and <hi>prepos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest</hi> into this <hi>body</hi> with some <hi>implicit no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> that it had learnt in another? And if this <hi>congruity</hi> to some <hi>opinions,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e to others be <hi>congenial</hi> to us, and not <hi>advenient</hi> from any thing in <hi>this state,</hi> 'tis me thinks clear that we were in a <hi>former.</hi> For the <hi>soul</hi> in its <hi>first</hi> and <hi>pure</hi> nature hath no <hi>idiosynerasies,</hi> that is, hath no <hi>proper</hi> natural inclinations which are not competent to others of the same kind and condition. Be sure, they are not fatally <hi>determin'd</hi> by their natures to <hi>false</hi> and <hi>erroneous apprehensions.</hi> And therefore since we find this determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to one or other falshood in many, if
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:53397:71"/>
not most in this state, and since 'tis very unlikely it is derived <hi>only</hi> from the <hi>body, custom,</hi> or <hi>education,</hi> what can we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive on't, but that our souls were tainted with these <hi>peculiar</hi> and <hi>wrong corruptions</hi> before we were <hi>extant</hi> upon this <hi>stage of Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Besides, 'tis easie to observe the strange and wonderful <hi>variety</hi> of our <hi>geniusses;</hi> one mans nature inclining him to one kind of study and imployment, anothers to what is very different. Some almost from their very <hi>cradles</hi> will be addicted to the making of figures, And in little <hi>mechanical</hi> contrivances; others love to be <hi>riming,</hi> almost as soon as they can speak plainly, and are taken up in smal essays of <hi>Poetry.</hi> Some will be scrawling <hi>pictures,</hi> and others take as great delight in some pretty offers at <hi>Musick</hi> and <hi>vocal harmony.</hi> Infinite almost are the ways in which this <hi>pure natural diversity</hi> doth discover it selfe. Now to say that all this variety proceeds primarily from the meer <hi>temper</hi> of our <hi>bodys,</hi> is me thinks a very poor and unsatisfying Account. For
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:53397:71"/>
those that are the most like in the <hi>temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ayr, complexion</hi> of their bodys, are yet of a vastly differing <hi>Genius.</hi> Yea they that havebeen made of the same clay, cast in the same mould, and have layn at once in the same natural bed, the womb; yea whose bodies have been as like as their state and fortunes, and their <hi>education</hi> &amp; usages the same, yet even they do not unfrequently differ as much from each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in their <hi>genius</hi> and <hi>dispositions</hi> of the <hi>mind,</hi> as those that in all these par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars are of very different condition. Besides there are all kind of <hi>makes, forms, dispositions, tempers,</hi> and <hi>complexions</hi> of <hi>body,</hi> that are addicted by their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to the same <hi>exercises</hi> and <hi>imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:</hi> so that to ascribe <hi>this</hi> to any <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarity</hi> in the <hi>Body,</hi> is me seems a very improbable solution of the <hi>Phaenomenon.</hi> And to say all these <hi>inclinations</hi> are from <hi>custom</hi> or <hi>education,</hi> is the way not to be believed, since all experience testifies the contrary.</p>
               <p>What then can we conjecture is the cause of all this <hi>diversity,</hi> but that we
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:53397:72"/>
had taken a great <hi>delight</hi> and <hi>pleasure</hi> in some things <hi>like</hi> and <hi>analogous</hi> unto'these, in a former condition? which now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain begins to put forth it selfe, when we are awakened out of our <hi>silent</hi> recess into a state of <hi>action.</hi> And though the <hi>imployments, pleasures</hi> and <hi>exercises</hi> of our former <hi>life,</hi> were without question very different from these in the present estate; yet 'tis no doubt, but that some of them were more <hi>confamiliar</hi> and <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalogous</hi> to some of our <hi>transactions,</hi> than others, so that as any exercise or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment here is more suitable to the particular dispositions that were praedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant in the other state, with the more peculiar kindnesse is it regarded by us, and the more greedily do our inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons now fasten on it. Thus if a <hi>Musitian</hi> should be interdicted the use of all <hi>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical</hi> instruments, and yet might have his choice of any other Art or profession, 'tis likely he would betake himselfe to <hi>Limning</hi> or <hi>Poetry;</hi> these exercises re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring the same <hi>disposition</hi> of <hi>wit</hi> and <hi>genius,</hi> as his beloved <hi>Musick</hi> did. And
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:53397:72"/>
                  <hi>we</hi> in like manner, being by the fate of our wretched <hi>descent</hi> hindred from the direct exercising our selves about the objects of our former <hi>delights</hi> and <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,</hi> do yet assoon as we are able, take to those things which do most corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spond to that <hi>genius</hi> that formerly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired us.</p>
               <p>And now 'tis time to take leave of the <hi>Arguments</hi> from <hi>Reason</hi> that give evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for <hi>Praeexistence.</hi> If any one think that they are not so <hi>Demonstrative,</hi> but that they may be <hi>answered,</hi> or at least <hi>evaded;</hi> I pray him to consider how many demonstrations he ever met with, that a good wit, resolv'd in a contrary cause, could not shuffle from the edge of. Or, let it be granted, that the <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> I have alledged are no <hi>infallible</hi> or <hi>necessary proofs;</hi> yet if they render my <hi>cause</hi> but <hi>probable,</hi> yea but <hi>possible,</hi> I have won what I contended for. For it having been made manifest by as good evidence as I think can be brought for any thing, that the way of <hi>new cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations</hi> is most <hi>inconsistent</hi> with the <hi>honor</hi>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:53397:73"/>
of the blessed <hi>Attributes</hi> of <hi>God:</hi> And that the other of <hi>Traduction</hi> is most <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible</hi> and <hi>contradictious</hi> in the <hi>nature</hi> of <hi>things:</hi> There being now no other way left but <hi>Praeexstence,</hi> if <hi>that</hi> be <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable</hi> or but barely <hi>possible,</hi> 'tis enough to give it the <hi>victory.</hi> And whether all that hath been said prove so much or no, I leave to the <hi>indifferent</hi> to determine. I think he that will say it doth not, can bring few proofs for any thing, which according to his way of judging will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve to be called <hi>Demonstrations.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>IT will be next expected, that I should now prove the Doctrine I have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken for, by <hi>Scripture evidence,</hi> and make good what I said above, That the <hi>divine oracles</hi> are not so silent in this matter as is imagined. But truly I have so tender a sense of the sacred Authority of that <hi>Holy volume,</hi> that I dare not be so <hi>bold</hi> with it, as to <hi>force</hi> it to speak what I think <hi>it intends</hi> not; A <hi>praesump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> that is too common among our confident <hi>opinionists,</hi> and that hath oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion'd great troubles to the <hi>Church,</hi> and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:53397:74"/>
disrepute to the <hi>inspired</hi> writings. For, for men to ascribe the <hi>odd</hi> notions of their <hi>over-heated</hi> imaginations to <hi>the spirit of God,</hi> and <hi>eternal truth,</hi> is me thinks a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bold and impudent <hi>belying</hi> it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I dare not but be very <hi>cautious</hi> what I speak in this matter, nor would I wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly urge <hi>Scripture</hi> as a proof of any thing, but what I am sure by the <hi>whole tenor</hi> of it, is therein contained: And would I take the <hi>liberty</hi> to fetch in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing for a <hi>Scripture-evidence,</hi> that with a little <hi>industry</hi> a man might make <hi>serviceable</hi> to his design: I doubt not but I should be able to <hi>fill</hi> my <hi>Margent</hi> with <hi>Quotations,</hi> which should be as much to <hi>purpose</hi> as have been cited in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>CATECHISMS</hi> and <hi>CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FESSIONS</hi> of <hi>FAITH,</hi> and that in points that must forsooth be dignified with the sacred title of <hi>FUNDAMENTAL.</hi> But <hi>Reverend ASSEMBLIES</hi> may make more bold with Scripture then <hi>private persons;</hi> And therefore I confesse I'me so <hi>timerous</hi> that I durst not follow their example: Though in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:53397:74"/>
that I would never have <hi>imposed</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the belief of any man, though I were <hi>certain</hi> on't, and had <hi>absolute</hi> power to injoyn it. I think the onely way to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the <hi>reverence</hi> due to the <hi>oracles</hi> of <hi>Truth,</hi> is never to urge their <hi>Authority</hi> but in things very <hi>momentous,</hi> and such as the whole <hi>current</hi> of them gives an <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident suffrage</hi> to. But to make them speak every <hi>trivial</hi> conceit that our sick brains can imagine or <hi>dream</hi> of, (as I intimated) is to <hi>vilisie</hi> and <hi>deflowre</hi> them. Therefore though I think that several <hi>Texts</hi> of <hi>Scripture</hi> look very fairly upon <hi>Praeexistence,</hi> and would encourage a man that considers what strong <hi>Reasons</hi> it hath to back it, to think, that very <hi>probably</hi> they mean some thing in <hi>savour</hi> of this <hi>Hypothesis;</hi> yet He not urge them as an <hi>irrefutable</hi> proof, being not willing to lay more stresse upon any thing then 'twil bear. Yea I am most willing to <hi>confesse</hi> the <hi>weaknesse</hi> of my <hi>Cause</hi> in what joint soever I shall disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it. And yet I must needs say, that who ever compares the <hi>Texts</hi> that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:53397:75"/>
with some particulars mention'd in the <hi>answer</hi> to the objection of <hi>Scripture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silence,</hi> will not chuse but acknowledge that there is very fair probability for <hi>Praeexistence</hi> in the <hi>written</hi> word of God, as there is in that which is <hi>engraven</hi> upon our rational <hi>natures.</hi> Therefore to bring together here what <hi>Scripture</hi> saith in this <hi>matter,</hi>

And me thinks God himselfe in his <hi>posing</hi> the great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of patience, <hi>Job,</hi> seems to intimate somewhat to this purpose, <hi>viz.</hi> that all <hi>spirits</hi> were in being when the <hi>Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of the <hi>earth</hi> were laid: when saith he, <hi>the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy.</hi> By the <hi>former</hi> very likely were meant the <hi>Angels,</hi> and 'tis not improbable but by the latter may be intended the blessed untainted <hi>souls.</hi> At least the particle <hi>All</hi> me thinks should comprize <hi>this</hi> order of spirits also. And within the same <hi>period</hi>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:53397:75"/>
of discourse, having question'd <hi>Job</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the nature and place of the <hi>Light,</hi> he Adds, <hi>I know that thou wast then born, for the number of thy days are many,</hi> as the <hi>Septuagint</hi> render it. And we know our <hi>Saviour</hi> and his <hi>Apostles</hi> have given credit to that <hi>Translation</hi> by their so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant following it. Nor doth that saying of God to <hi>Jeremias</hi> in the beginnning of his <hi>charge</hi> seem to <hi>intimate</hi> lesse, <hi>Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee, and before thou camest out of the womb, I gave thee wisdome;</hi> as reads a very <hi>creditable version.</hi> Now though each of these pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces might be drawn to <hi>another</hi> sense, yet that onely argues that they are no neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary proof for <hi>Praeexistence,</hi> which I rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily acknowledge; nor do I intend any such matter by alledging them. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver I hope they will be <hi>confest</hi> to be <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable</hi> to <hi>this</hi> sense; and if there be <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> grounds that <hi>perswade</hi> this <hi>Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis</hi> to be the <hi>truth,</hi> 'tis I think very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that these Texts <hi>intend</hi> it <hi>favour.</hi> which whether it be so or no, we have seen already.</p>

2. For the Texts of the <hi>New</hi> Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that seem to look pleasingly upon <hi>Praeexistence,</hi> I shall as briefly <hi>hint</hi> them as I did the <hi>former.</hi> And <hi>me thinks</hi> that passage of our <hi>Saviours</hi> prayer, <hi>Father, Glorifie me with the same glory I had with thee before the world began,</hi> sounds somewhat to this purpose.</p>
               <p>The glory which he prays to be <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored</hi> to, seems to concern his <hi>humane</hi> nature onely; for the <hi>divine</hi> could never lose it. And therefore it <hi>supposeth</hi> that he was in his <hi>humanity</hi> existent <hi>before:</hi> And that his <hi>soul</hi> was of <hi>old</hi> before his <hi>appearance</hi> in a <hi>Terrestial</hi> body. Which seems also to be intimated by the expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of his <hi>comming from the Father, descending from Heaven,</hi> and <hi>returning thither</hi> again, which he very frequently makes use of. And we know the <hi>Divinity</hi> that fils <hi>all</hi> things, cannot <hi>move to,</hi> or <hi>quit</hi> a place, it being a manifest <hi>imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi> and contray to his <hi>Immensity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I might add those other expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of our Saviour's taking upon him the <hi>forme</hi> of a <hi>servant,</hi> of <hi>rich</hi> for our

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:53397:78"/>
I find my selfe obliged to go a little further then the bare proof, and defence of <hi>Praeexistence.</hi> For though what I have said, may possibly induce some to think favourably of our <hi>conclusion,</hi> That <hi>The souls of men were made before they came into these bodys;</hi> yet whil they shal think that nothing can be <hi>conceived</hi> of that <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer state,</hi> And that our <hi>Praeexistent</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition cannot be represented to Humane understanding, but as a <hi>dark black</hi> soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude: it must needs weaken the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion of those that are lesse confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and fill the minds of the inquisitive with a dubious trouble and Anxiety. For searching and contemplative Heads can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be satisfyed to be told, That our <hi>souls have lived and acted in a former condition,</hi> except they can be helpt to some more <hi>particular</hi> apprehension of that <hi>stare;</hi> How we lived and acted of <hi>old,</hi> and how probably we <hi>fell</hi> from that <hi>better life,</hi> into this Region of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery and imperfection.</p>
               <p>Now though indeed my charity would prompt me to do what I can for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:53397:79"/>
and ease of auy modest inquirer; yet shall I not attempt to satisfie punctual and eager <hi>curiosity</hi> in things <hi>hidden</hi> and <hi>unsearchable.</hi> Much lesse shall I posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively determine any thing in matters so Lubricous and uncertain. And indeed considering how imperfect our now <hi>state</hi> is, how miserable shallow our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings are, and how little we know of our present selves, and the things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout us, it may seem a desperate under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking to attempt any thing in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Yea, when we contemplate the vast <hi>circuits</hi> of the <hi>Divine wisdome,</hi> and think how much the thoughts and actions of <hi>Aeternity</hi> and <hi>omniscience</hi> are beyond ours, <hi>who are but of Yesterday, and know nothing,</hi> it must needs discourage Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence it selfe <hi>from</hi> determining, how the <hi>Oeconomy</hi> of the <hi>world</hi> of <hi>life</hi> was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, in the day the <hi>Heavens</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> were framed. There are doubtless in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite ways and methods according to which the unsearchable wisdome of our Maker could have disposed of us, which we can have no conceit of; And we are
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:53397:79"/>
little more capable of unerringly resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving our selves now, how it was with us of old, then a child in the womb is to determine, what kind of life it shall live when it is set at liberty from that <hi>dark inclosure.</hi> Therefore let shame and blush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cover his face that shall confidently affirm that 'twas <hi>thus</hi> or <hi>thus</hi> with us in the <hi>state</hi> of our <hi>Fore-Beings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>However, to shew that it may have been that our <hi>Souls</hi> did <hi>Praeexist,</hi> though we cannot punctually and certainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude upon the <hi>Particular State,</hi> I shall presume to draw up a conceivable <hi>Scheame</hi> of the <hi>Hypothesis;</hi> And if our narrow minds can think of a way how it might have been, I hope no body will deny that the <hi>divine wisdom</hi> could have contriv'd it so, or infinitely better than we can imagine in our little modells.</p>
               <p>And now I would not have it thought that I goe about to insinuate or represent any opinions of mine own, or that I am a votary to all the notions I make use of, whether of the <hi>Antient,</hi> or more modern <hi>Philosophers.</hi> For I seriously professe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

all determinations in this kind. But my business onely is, by some imperfect hints and guesses to help to apprehend a little how the state of <hi>Praeexistence</hi> might have been, and so to let in some beams of <hi>antient</hi> and <hi>modern light</hi> upon this <hi>immense</hi> darknesse. Therefore let the Reader if he please call it a <hi>Romantick scheam,</hi> or <hi>imaginary Hypothesis,</hi> or what name else best fits his <hi>phancy,</hi> and he'l not offend me; Nor do I hold my selfe concern'd at all to vindicate the truth of any thing here that is the fruit of mine own invention or composure; Though I confesse I could beg civilityes at least for the notions I have borrowed from great and worthy Sages.

               <p>Now because the Frame of the <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Hypothesis</hi> is originally <hi>Philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,</hi> I shall therefore not deprave it by mingling with it the opinions of <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Theologers,</hi> or distort any thing to make it accommodate to their <hi>dogmata,</hi> but solely and sincerely follow the light of <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Philosophy.</hi> For I intend not to endeavour the late alteration of the ordinary <hi>systeme</hi> of <hi>Divinity,</hi> nor designe any thing in this place but a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation of some harmlesse <hi>philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical</hi> conjectures: In which I shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually guide my selfe by the Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of the <hi>world,</hi> and the best discoveryes of the <hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>Soul.</hi>

                  <p>And that this <hi>Nemesis</hi> should be twist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the very <hi>natural coustitutions</hi> of things themselves, is methinks very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable; since questionlesse, <hi>Almighty wisdom</hi> could so perfectly have formed his works at first, as that all things that he saw were <hi>regular, just,</hi> and for the good of the <hi>universe,</hi> should have been brought about by those <hi>stated Laws,</hi> which we call <hi>nature;</hi> without an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary engagement of <hi>absolute power</hi> to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect them.

'Tis an ordinary observation among them that are imployed in <hi>mines</hi> and <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneous vaults</hi> of any depth, that <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy</hi> bodies lose much of their <hi>gravity</hi> in those hollow <hi>caverns:</hi> So that what the strength of several men cannot stir above ground, is easily moved by the single force of one under it: Now to improve this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment, 'tis very likely that <hi>gravity</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from a kind of <hi>magnetism</hi> and <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive</hi> virtue in the <hi>earth,</hi> which is by so much the more strong and vigorous, by how much more of the <hi>attrahent</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes to the <hi>action,</hi> and proportionably <hi>weaker,</hi> where less of the <hi>magnetick</hi> Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment exerts its <hi>operation;</hi> so that suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the <hi>solid earth,</hi> to reach but to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and that not very great distance from the surface, and 'tis obvious this way to give an account of the <hi>Phoenomenon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For according to this <hi>Hypothesis</hi> the <hi>gravity</hi> of those bodies is <hi>lesse,</hi> because the <hi>quantity</hi> of the <hi>earth</hi> that draws them is <hi>so;</hi> whereas were it of the same nature and solidity to the <hi>center,</hi> this diminuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of its <hi>bulk,</hi> and consequently <hi>vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi> would not be at all considerable,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:53397:103"/>
nor in the least sensible: Now though there are other causes pretended for this effect, yet there is none so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and easie a solution as this, though I know <hi>it</hi> also is obnoxious to excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which I cannot now <hi>stand</hi> to to meddle with; all that I would have is, that 'tis a <hi>probability,</hi> and the mention of the <hi>fountains</hi> of the <hi>great deep</hi> in the <hi>sacred History,</hi> as also the <hi>flaming Vulca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noes</hi> and <hi>smoking mountains</hi> that all relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons speak of, are others.</p>

vast hollows, the contents of which 'twere vanity to go about to determine; only 'tis very likely, that as the admirable <hi>Philosophy</hi> of <hi>Des Cartes</hi> supposeth, the lowest and <hi>central</hi> Regions may be filled with <hi>flame</hi> and <hi>aether,</hi> which suppositions, though they may seem to some to be but the groundless <hi>excursions</hi> of busie <hi>imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations;</hi> yet those that know the <hi>French Philosophy,</hi> and see <hi>there</hi> the Reasons of them, will be more candid in their cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, and not so severe to those not ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>framed <hi>conjectures.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now then being thus provided, I return again to prosecute my main intendment; Wherefore 'tis very probable, that the <hi>wicked</hi> and <hi>degenerate</hi> part of mankind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>are after death committed to those squal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid <hi>subterraneous</hi> habitations; in which <hi>dark prisons,</hi> they do severe <hi>penance</hi> for their past <hi>impletyes,</hi> And have their <hi>sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> which upon earth they did so fondly indulge, and took such care to gratifie, now persecuted with <hi>darknesse, stench,</hi> and <hi>horror.</hi> Thus doth the <hi>divine justice</hi> tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph in punishing those vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="169" facs="tcp:53397:104"/>
Now if those vicious souls are not carried down to the <hi>infernal caverns</hi> by the meer <hi>congruity</hi> of their natures, as is not so easie to imagine; we may then rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably conceive, that they are driven into those <hi>dungeons</hi> by the <hi>invisible Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters</hi> of <hi>justice,</hi> that manage the affairs of the <hi>world</hi> by <hi>Axiom</hi> 3. For those pure <hi>spirits</hi> doubtless have a deep <hi>sence</hi> of what is <hi>just,</hi> and for the <hi>good</hi> of the <hi>universe;</hi> and therefore will not let those inexcusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wretches to escape their deserved <hi>castigations;</hi> or permit them to resicle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>good,</hi> lest they should infect and poyson the better world, by their exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. Wherefore I say, they are disposed of into those <hi>black under-Abysses;</hi> where they are suited with company like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and match't unto <hi>bodies</hi> as <hi>impure,</hi> as are their depraved <hi>inclinations.</hi> Not that they are all in the same <hi>place</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the like <hi>torments;</hi> but are variously di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed according to the merits of their <hi>natures</hi> and <hi>actions;</hi> some only into the <hi>upper prisons,</hi> others to the <hi>Dungeon:</hi> And some to the most intollerable <hi>Hell,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Now those miserable prisoners cannot escape from the places of their confinement; for 'tis very likely that those watchfull <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi> that were instrumental in committing them, have a strict and careful eye upon them to keep them within the confines of their goal, that they roave not out into the Regions of <hi>light</hi> and <hi>liberty,</hi> yea 'tis proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that the <hi>bodies</hi> they have contracted in those <hi>squallid</hi> mansions, may by a kind of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal <hi>magnetisme</hi> be chained down to this their <hi>proper</hi> element. Or, they having now a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity</hi> only to such <hi>fatid vehicles,</hi> may be no more able to abide the <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>lightsome</hi> ayr, then the <hi>Bat</hi> or <hi>Owl</hi> are able to bear the <hi>Suns</hi> noon-day <hi>beams;</hi> or, the <hi>fish</hi> to live in these thinner Regions. This may be the reason of the <hi>unfrequency</hi> of their appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; and that they most commonly get them away at the approach of <hi>light.</hi> Besides all this, some there are who suppose that there is a kind of <hi>polity</hi> among themselves, which may, under severe penalties, prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit all unlicensed <hi>excursions</hi> into the <hi>upper world;</hi> though I confess this seems not so
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:53397:105"/>
probable, and we stand in no need of the supposition. For though the <hi>laws</hi> of their natures should not detain them within their <hi>proper residences;</hi> yet the care and oversight of those watchful spirits; who first com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them, will do it effectually. And ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry oft when they do appear, they signifie that they are under restraint, and come <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Now though I intend not this <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> either for a discovery of infallible truth, or declarement of mine own opinions, yet I cannot forbear to note the strange <hi>coinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> that there is between <hi>Scripture-expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi> in this matter, some main stroaks of the <hi>Orthodox</hi> Doctrine, and this <hi>Philosophical</hi> conjecture of the <hi>state</hi> and <hi>place</hi> of the <hi>wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> 'Tis represented in the <hi>Divine Oracles</hi> as a <hi>deep pit,</hi> a <hi>prison,</hi> a place of <hi>darkness, fire,</hi> and <hi>bri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="172" facs="tcp:53397:106"/>
since it abounds with <hi>fuliginous flames,</hi> and <hi>sulphurious stench</hi> and <hi>vapours;</hi> And, as we have conjectur'd, the lowest <hi>cavity,</hi> is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>else</hi> but a <hi>valut</hi> of <hi>fire.</hi> For the other expressions mention'd, every one can make the application. So that when a man consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders this, he will almost be tempted to think, that the <hi>inspired writers</hi> had some such thing in their <hi>fancies.</hi> And we are not to run to <hi>tropes</hi> and <hi>figures</hi> for the <hi>interpretation</hi> of <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>literal descriptions;</hi> except some weighty reason force us to such a <hi>Refuge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover <hi>Hell</hi> is believ'd among the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox</hi> to have degrees of <hi>torments,</hi> to be a place of uncomfortable <hi>horror,</hi> and to stand at the greatest distance from the <hi>seat</hi> and <hi>ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation</hi> of the <hi>blessed.</hi> All which, and more that I could reckon up, cannot more clearly made out and explained, then they are in this <hi>Hypothesis.</hi>
                  </p>

would conclude, that in time they might then be deliver'd from their lad <hi>durance;</hi> But we know what <hi>Theology</hi> hath determined.

                  <p>Wherefore the <hi>earth</hi> and all the <hi>infernal Regions</hi> being thus monstrously depraved; 'tis time for the <hi>Divine Justice</hi> to shew some remarkable and more then ordinary <hi>severity</hi> upon those <hi>remorseless Rebels;</hi> and his goodness is as ready to deliver the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous from this <hi>stage</hi> of <hi>wretchedness</hi> and <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety.</hi> When therefore <hi>those</hi> have compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the number of their iniquities, and these are fit for the mercy of so great a <hi>delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;</hi> then shall the great <hi>decree</hi> for <hi>judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> be <hi>executed;</hi> which though it cannot be expected that meer <hi>Philosophy</hi> should give

                  <p>Those <hi>thick</hi> and <hi>clammy</hi> vapours which erstwhile ascended in such vast measures, and had fil'd the <hi>vault</hi> of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with <hi>smoak</hi> and <hi>darknesse,</hi> must
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:53397:110"/>
at length obey the Laws of their nature and gravity, and so descend again in abundant <hi>showres,</hi> and mingle with the <hi>subsiding ashes,</hi> which will consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute a <hi>mudd vegetative</hi> and <hi>fertile.</hi> For those warm and benign beams, that now again begin to visit the <hi>desolate</hi> Earth, will excite those <hi>seminal prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> into action, which the <hi>Divine Wisdome</hi> and <hi>goodnesse</hi> hath mingled with all things. Wherefore they opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting according to their natures, and the dispositions which they find in the resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red matter, will shoot forth in all sorts of <hi>flowers, herbs,</hi> and <hi>trees;</hi> Making the whole <hi>Earth</hi> a <hi>Garden</hi> of <hi>delight</hi> and <hi>pleasure;</hi> And erecting all the <hi>Phaenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> proper to this <hi>Element.</hi> By this time the <hi>Ayre</hi> will be grown <hi>vitall</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain and far more pure and pleasant, then before the <hi>fiery purgation.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they conceive, that the disbodyed soules shall return from their unactive and <hi>silent</hi> recesse, and be joined again to bodyes of purified and duly prepared <hi>Ayre.</hi> For their <hi>radaical aptitude</hi> to matter
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:53397:111"/>
still remained, though theyfell <hi>asleep</hi> for want of bodies of fit temper to unite with.</p>
                  <p>This is the summ of the <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis</hi> as it is represented by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundly Learned Dr. <hi>H. More,</hi> with a <hi>copious</hi> and <hi>pompous eloquence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now supposing such a <hi>recess</hi> of any souls into a state of in activity, such a <hi>Restitution</hi> of them to <hi>life</hi> and <hi>acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> is very reasonable; since it is much better for them to <hi>Live</hi> and <hi>ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi> again, then to be uselesse in the <hi>universe,</hi> and as it were nothing for ever. And we have seen above, that the <hi>Divine goodnesse</hi> doth always what is <hi>best,</hi> and his <hi>wisdom</hi> is not so shallow as to make his creatures so as that he should be fain to banish them into a state that is next to <hi>non-entity,</hi> there to remain through all <hi>duration.</hi> Thus then will those lately tormented souls, having smarted for their past iniquities, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered both from their <hi>state</hi> of <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>rtech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednesse</hi> and <hi>insensibility;</hi> and by the unspeakable <hi>benignity</hi> of their <hi>Maker,</hi> placed once more in such conditions,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:53397:111"/>
wherein by their own endeavours, and the divine assistance they may amend what was formerly amiss in them, and pursue any <hi>good Resolutions</hi> that they took while under thelash of the fiery tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; which thos that do, when their <hi>good inclinations</hi> are perfected, and the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Life</hi> again enkindled, they shall in due time reascend the <hi>Thrones</hi> they so unhappily fell from, &amp; be circled about with unexpressible felicity. Butthose that for all this, follow the sameways of <hi>sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suality</hi> and <hi>rebellion</hi> against their merciful deliverer, they shal besure tobe met with by the same <hi>methods</hi> of <hi>punishment;</hi> and at length be as miserable as ever.</p>
                  <p>Thus we see the <hi>Ayr</hi> will be <hi>re-peopled</hi> after the <hi>conflagration:</hi> but how the <hi>Earth</hi> will so soon be restored to <hi>Inhabitants,</hi> is a matter of some difficulty to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine since it useth to be furnisht from the <hi>Aerial</hi> regions, which now will have none left that are fit to plant it. For the <hi>good</hi> were deliver'd thence before the <hi>conflagration:</hi> and those that are newly come from underthe fiery lash and latter
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:53397:112"/>
state of <hi>silence,</hi> are in a hopeful way of <hi>recovery;</hi> At least, their aerial <hi>congruity</hi> cannot be so soon expired, as to fit them for an early return to their <hi>terrestriall prisons.</hi> Wherfore to help our selves in this rencounter, we must remember, that there are continually multitudes of souls in a state of <hi>inactivity,</hi> for want of suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able bodyes to unite with, there being more that dye to the aery state, then are born into this <hi>terrestrial.</hi> In this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition were <hi>myriads,</hi> when the general <hi>Feaver</hi> seiz'd this great <hi>distemper'd body;</hi> who therefore were unconcern'd in the <hi>conflagration,</hi> and are now as ready to return into <hi>life</hi> and <hi>action</hi> upon the <hi>Earth</hi>'s happy <hi>restauration,</hi> as if no such thing had hapned.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore they will not fail to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend into fitly <hi>prepared matter,</hi> and to exercise all the <hi>functsons</hi> proper to this condition. Nor will they alone be inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the <hi>Earth.</hi> For all the variety of other <hi>Animals,</hi> shall live and act up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this <hi>stage</hi> with them; all sorts of souls infinuating themselves into those
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:53397:112"/>
bodys, which are fit for their respective natures.</p>
                  <p>Thus then supposing habitable <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous</hi> bodyes, there is no doubt, but there will be humane <hi>Souls</hi> to <hi>actuate</hi> and <hi>informe</hi> them; but all the difficulty is to conceive how the <hi>matter</hi> shall be <hi>prepared.</hi> For who shall be the common <hi>seedsman</hi> of succeding Humanity, when all mankind is swept away by the <hi>fiery deluge?</hi> And to take Sanctuary in a <hi>Miracle</hi> is <hi>unphilosophical</hi> and <hi>desperate.</hi> I thinke therefore, it is not <hi>improbable</hi> (I mean according to the duct of this <hi>Hypothesis</hi>) but that in this <hi>renewed youth,</hi> of the so lately <hi>calcined</hi> and <hi>purified Earth,</hi> there may be some pure <hi>efflorescences</hi> of <hi>balmy</hi> matter, not to be found now in its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausted and decrepit <hi>Age,</hi> that may be proper <hi>vehicles</hi> of <hi>life</hi> into which souls may deseend without further <hi>preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> And so orderly shape and form them, as we see to this day several sorts of other creatures do, without the help of generation. For doubtlesse there will be great plenty of <hi>unctuous spirituous</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:53397:113" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <hi>matter,</hi> when the most inward and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condite</hi> spirits of all things, shall be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodg'd from their <hi>old</hi> close <hi>residences;</hi> and scatter'd into the <hi>Ayre;</hi> where they will at length, when the fierce agitation of the fire is over, gather in considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble proportions of <hi>tenuous vapours;</hi> which at length descending in a <hi>chrystal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line liquor,</hi> and mingling with the finest parts of the <hi>newly modified</hi> Earth, will doubtless compose as <hi>genital</hi> a matter as any can be prepared in the bodys of <hi>Animals.</hi> And the <hi>calm</hi> and <hi>wholesome Ayre</hi> which now is duly purged from its noxious <hi>reeks</hi> and <hi>vapours,</hi> and abounds with their <hi>saline spirituous humidity,</hi> will questionlesse be very propitious to those tender <hi>inchoations</hi> of <hi>life;</hi> and by the help of the Sun's favourable and gentle <hi>beams,</hi> supply them with all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary materials.</p>
                  <p>Nor need we puzzle our selves to phancy, how those <hi>Terrae Filii,</hi> those young sons of the Earth will be fortified against the injuries of <hi>weather,</hi> or be able to provide for themselves in their first
<pb facs="tcp:53397:113" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and tender <hi>Infancy;</hi> since doubtlesse, if the supposition be admitted, those <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate births</hi> of <hi>unassisted</hi> nature will not be so <hi>tender</hi> and <hi>helplesse</hi> as <hi>we,</hi> into whose very constitutions <hi>delicacy</hi> and <hi>effeminatenesse</hi> is now twisted. For those <hi>masculine productions</hi> which were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways exposed to the open <hi>Ayr,</hi> and not <hi>cloyster'd</hi> up as we, will feel no more incommodity from it, then the young fry of fishes do from the coldnesse of the water they are spawn'd in. And even now much of our tendernesse and <hi>deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy</hi> is not natural but <hi>contracted.</hi> For <hi>poor</hi> children will indure that hardshp that would quickly dispatch those that have had a more careful and officious nurture. And without question we should do many things for <hi>self-preservati on</hi> and <hi>provision,</hi> which now we yield no signes of; had not custome prevented the <hi>endeavours</hi> of <hi>nature,</hi> and made it expect assistance; For the <hi>Indian In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants</hi> will swim currently, when assoon as they are born, they are thrown into the water. And nature put to her shifts,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:53397:114"/>
will do many things more then we can suspect her able for the performance of: which consider'd, 'tis not hard to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, but that those infant <hi>Aborigines,</hi> are of a very different temper and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition from the weak products of now decayed nature: having questionlesse, more pure and <hi>serviceable bodies, senses</hi> and other <hi>faculties</hi> more <hi>active</hi> and <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous,</hi> and <hi>nature</hi> better exercised; so that they may by a like <hi>sence</hi> to that which carrys all creatures to their proper food, pursue and take hold of that nutriment which the <hi>free</hi> and <hi>willing Earth</hi> now offerd to their mouths; till being advantaged by <hi>Age</hi> and <hi>growth,</hi> they can move about to make their choice. But all this is but the <hi>frolick</hi> exercise of my pen chusing a <hi>Paradox;</hi> And 'tis time to give over the pursuit.</p>
                  <p>To make an end then, we see that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>Conflagration</hi> the earth will be <hi>inhabited</hi> again, and all things proceed much what in like manner as before. But whether the <hi>Catastrophe</hi> of <hi>this</hi> shall bee like the former or no, I think is not
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:53397:114"/>
to be determined. For as one world hath <hi>perish't</hi> by <hi>water,</hi> and this present <hi>shall</hi> by <hi>fire,</hi> 'tis possible the next <hi>period</hi> may be by the <hi>Extinction</hi> of the <hi>Sun.</hi> But I am come to the end of the <hi>line,</hi> and shall not go beyond this present Stage of <hi>Providence,</hi> or wander into an <hi>Abysse</hi> of uncertainties, where there is neither <hi>Sun</hi> nor <hi>Star</hi> to guide my notions.</p>
                  <p>Now of all that hath been represented of this <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> there is nothing that seems more <hi>extravagant</hi> and <hi>Romantick</hi> then those notions that come under the two last Generals; And yet so it falls out, that the main matters contained under them, one would think to have a strange consonancy with some expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the <hi>Sacred Oracles.</hi> For clear it is from the <hi>divine Volumne,</hi> that the <hi>wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> and the <hi>Devils</hi> themselves are reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to a further and more severe <hi>judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> then yet afflicteth them; It is as plainly declared to be a <hi>vengeance</hi> of <hi>fire</hi> that abides them, as a compleatment of their torments: And that the <hi>Earth</hi> shall be <hi>burnt,</hi> is as explicitly affirmed, as
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:53397:115"/>
any thing can be spoken. Now if we put all these together, they look like a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, That the <hi>conflagration</hi> of the <hi>Earth</hi> shall consummate the <hi>Hell</hi> of the wicked. And those other expressions of <hi>Death, Destruction, perdition</hi> of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, and the like, seem to show a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable regard to the State of silence and <hi>inactivity.</hi> Nor is there less appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing countenance given to the <hi>Hypothesis</hi> of <hi>Restitution,</hi> in those passages which predict <hi>New Heavens</hi> and a <hi>New Earth,</hi> and seem to intimate onely a <hi>change</hi> of the present.</p>
                  <p>And yet I would have no body be so credulous as to be taken with litle ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, nor do I mention these with an intent that they should with full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent be delivered to intend the asserting any such Doctrines; But that there is shew enough both in Reason and Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for these Opinions to give an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion for an <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> and therefore that they are not meer <hi>arbitrary</hi> and <hi>idle imaginations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:53397:115"/>
Now whatever becomes of this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>draught</hi> of the Souls severall <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions</hi> of life and action, the main O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of <hi>Praeexistence</hi> is not at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. This <hi>scheame</hi> is onely to shew that natural and imperfect Reason can frame an <hi>Intelligible Idea</hi> of it; And therefore questionlesse the Divine <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> could forme and order it, either so, or with infinitely more <hi>accuracy</hi> and <hi>exactness.</hi> How it was with us therefore of <hi>Old,</hi> I know not; But yet that we may have been, and acted before we descended hither, I think is very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And I see no Reason but why <hi>Praeexistence</hi> may be Admitted without altering any thing considerable of the ordinary <hi>Systeme</hi> of <hi>Theology.</hi> But I shut up with that modest conclusion of the Great <hi>Des Cartes.</hi>
