            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Theſe three verſes denote to us, that whom God exalted, we muſt, and for the ſame cauſe extoll our Saviour.</p>
               <p>The generall Parts are two. Firſt, <hi>Summum<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Opus,</hi> the higheſt worke. <hi>Exaltatio perſonae, &amp; exaltatio nominis,</hi> the exaltation of his perſon, and the exaltation of his name. Either of them by God, and by us either. By God in the 9. <hi>verſe, Wherefore alſo God hath highly exalted him, and given him a Name above every Name.</hi> And by us in the 10, &amp; 11. <hi>verſes. That at the Name of Jeſus every knee ſhould bow, of things in heaven, and in earth, and under the earth. And that every tongue ſhould confeſſe that Jeſus Christ is Lord.</hi> Secondly, <hi>finis ſummus,</hi> the higheſt end; <hi>Gloria Dei,</hi> the glory of God. All that is done, is to the glory of God the Father. Both are raiſed on ſure ground. There is a <hi>propter quod</hi> at the entrance to tell us that. A ſupernaturall conjunction, and a ſupernaturall effect. God and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54419:6"/>
man in one to ſet at unity God and man. For the union and for our ſalvation; therefore God hath highly exalted him.</p>
               <p>We have now gained theſe <hi>praecognita</hi>; God is prime efficient in the exaltation, we ſubſervient; God and man the materiall cauſe, the union the formall; Our Salvation the next finall, and the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God the laſt.</p>
               <p>The formall, and the finall firſt in execution, are firſt in hand. The efficient; and materiall will be next; The ſubſervient after; But the firſt intenſion in execution laſt.</p>

               </p>
               <p>We deny therefore that Chriſts humiliation <hi>ſecundum carnem,</hi> as a worke of his humanity, was the <hi>propter quod,</hi> that merited his exaltation. But are poſitive that <hi>propter quod formale,</hi> the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall, impulſive, or formall cauſe, wherefore God highly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted him, is the grace of union: And ſatisfaction being made by his death for us, that glory may be ours alſo is, <hi>propter quod finale,</hi> the externall impulſive, or firſt finall Wherefore of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation.</p>
               <p>The Papiſt here ſlander us in ſaying, we allow not Chriſt to merit ought. For firſt our tenet is, that not for any thing in the fleſh, but for the Word whereto the fleſh is united, was the fleſh exalted. Secondly, that God being made man, in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of God and Man, was worthineſſe to deſerve over and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver what we can conceive. Thirdly, that it is ſupercilious cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity, wherein Scriptures are ſilent to define what Chriſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited to himſelfe. Fourthly, that it is expreſſed throughout the Teſtaments, old and new, that he had little or no regard
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54419:8"/>
of himſelfe, but for us; All that might be for our Salvation. Laſtly, that the humility, and the glory being ſet downe in the eternall decree, the glorification followed the humiliation, <hi>ſuâ ſponte,</hi> of its owne accord, or by the union neceſſarily. And this is held the principall reaſon, wherefore the man ſo humbled both might and ought to be ſo highly exalted. Bring theſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> and <hi>Calviniſts</hi> ſo well agree here, that who oppoſe in what follows, will be condemned at <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, by that which went before.</p>
               <p>True Chriſtians we referre the Wherefore in the Text, not to Chriſts being made obedient onely, but to the cauſe alſo of his humiliation. It was his charity there: He would be humbled unto, that we might be delivered from death. And his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity here alſo: He would be exalted, that we through him might be glorified. Our freedome then from hell, and entrance into Heaven beginning at his love, have perfection after his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence by his exaltation. His humiliation merited our exaltati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though not his owne. His owne was by the union, and not in any thing elſe meaſured unto him. We finde not why hee ſhould merit any thing to himſelfe, whoſe perfection wanted nothing that might be acquired by merit. This we know, it was decreed, that God ſhould be inhumanated to dye, and riſe againe for us. As inhumanated he dyed; and is exalted as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanated. The fleſh is the inſtrument of the Word, wherein it doth ſubſiſt. The fleſh therefore ſubſiſting in the perſon of the Sonne of God we determine the <hi>propter quod,</hi> or wherefore, why the Sonne of God did dye. The ſame ſubſiſtence, <hi>propter quod etiam,</hi> the wherefore alſo, why he is exalted. He dyed; How? As man; Why? For us. He is exalted; How? As man; Why? For us. For us then is the other <hi>propter quod,</hi> or Wherefore in the Text. <hi>Wherefore alſo God hath highly exalted him.</hi>

The worke was individedly of the three, though fitted but to one. The ſecond perſon, by the eternall counſell of the Holy Trinity, undertaking the humiliation, with him the other two exalted him. We ſeclude not the perſon exalted, from the agent exalting: becauſe their eſſence is but one. Who are Holy, Holy, Holy, are the ſame Lord and God. The God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head then exalting, the advancement might be high. As high ſay we, as God would. We know not how high, ſure above death; Not to dye againe, to be immortall; Not on earth, above the Heavens; Not to glory created onely, above, to the glory of the Father. At the right hand of God, thither we beleeve; but the immenſity of the power, dominion, and honour we comprehend not. It is enough for us that his Authority royall is ſo manifeſted, that we doubt it not. And our comfort is, he hath ſo diſpenſed with the manhood, that our nature remaines for ever entire in his perſon. Being therefore our head, and ſuch a head, he can no more forget us, then not remember himſelfe; and remembring us, is both able and willing to bring us unto himſelfe. Rejoyce we may and be glad; we are his members; he is gone before, we ſhall follow after. His humiliation was to purchaſe us, his exaltation to provide for us: whom he purchaſed by his blood, he will at the time receive us into his glory.

               <p>Or if you will looke no farther then the giving of a Name, to know what Name was given, you may be ſatisfied there. For it is granted by all, that the giving of a Name here, is the exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Name. <hi>Dicitur res fieri, quando innoteſeit</hi>; For in Scripture often a thing is ſaid to be done, when it is made to be knowne,<note place="margin">Pet. Lomb. Sent l. <hi>3.</hi> D. <hi>18.</hi>
                  </note> as <hi>Peter Lombard</hi> hath obſerved. I finde not that any one of the Fathers, nor any one of our Church, or of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches beyond the Seas, denies this. This granted, the Name exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted was the Name humbled. Becauſe nothing can be lifted up, but muſt have an <hi>unde,</hi> whence it was lifted.</p>
               <p>Neither the Name God, nor the Name Chriſt was deſpighted in him. For his enemies neither acknowledged him God, nor Chriſt. Jeſus was the Name called his at his Circumciſion, by it he was knowne, and in it revealed. It among the Jewes ſignified nothing,<note place="margin">Luke 2.21.</note> ſave a vile man, a Carpenter, a friend of ſinners, a drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard, a Glutton, a Sorcerer, a Devill, one ambitious, a Seducer, a Blaſphemer; to put out it, they crucified him, and after his Reſurrection hired the Souldiers to ſay his Diſciples had ſtolen him away. No doubt of this, we have it recorded in the foure Evangeliſts. If any man can ſhew me how any other Name of Chriſt was ſo abaſed, or neare ſo, as this, ile yeeld to that. But ſince no other can be found ſo aviled, this muſt be it. The Name of God the Jewes highly reverenced, and in the Name of Meſſiah, that is, Chriſt, or the Annointed, they gloryed. Onely Jeſus was the Name of ſcorne throughout his humiliation. If then there were a Name to be advanced higheſt, Jeſus is it. For from the loweſt to the higheſt, is the higheſt advancement ever.</p>

                  </note> Chriſt is the Name of a Sacrament, and a Sacrament of inauguration. He is enſtalled our Saviour, or by the Father, and the holy Ghoſt conſecrated to it.

therefore above every Name to him is his Name Jeſus.</p>
               <p>If to him, certainly above all to us. For we fallen in <hi>Adam</hi> are ſubject to death temporall and eternall. Not ſo, as not to be, but ſo as to be tormented ever.

But God be thanked, the Sonne of God out of his imperveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable treaſure brought enough, over and over, to adopt us into the peace of the bleſſed Trinity. Chriſt hath done this, and no other could. Not incidently this, but, <hi>ex officio,</hi> he was annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto the three ſaving offices, that he might be the abſolute Jeſus to ſave his people from their ſinnes.

But more, as, <hi>ad extra,</hi> one worke is greater then another, Redemption, then Creation. The good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God is more expreſſed by this Name then any other. Jehovah indeed ſignifies God as Lord and Creatour, <hi>Sed nihil naſci profuit niſi redimi profuiſſet,</hi> yet it were better not to bee, then not to be redeemed. Or what profit is it with the Jew to acknowledge Jehovah, and not with the Chriſtian to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in Jeſus?</p>
               <p>Secondly, Redemption preſuppoſeth Creation, and, not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining Redemption without the Father and the Holy Ghoſt, we ſay, the Name of the Redeemer includes with the Name of God the Creatour, the Name of man the Creature, and ſignifies God and man reconciled. Not on the contrary, though hee that redeemed created alſo. For <hi>I am that I am,</hi> is one expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and <hi>I am that I am</hi> the Saviour, a further. God in his Name Jehovah denotes the being whence all things tooke their originall.

               <p>To him onely, and to him according to both natures. This is orthodox, though all agree not in this.</p>
               <p>Some here underſtand Chriſt, <hi>ſecundum humanam naturam,</hi> as man. Becauſe as God nothing can in time be really given to him. So the Scholiaſts, ſo <hi>Theodoret, Hierome,</hi> and others, as <hi>Zanchius</hi> recites. Indeed if we minde an increment of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe, or power, or wiſdome, &amp;c. no ſuch thing can in time be given to him according to his Deity. Yet that he received nothing as God whereby our happineſſe might be furthered, and further knowne, is falſe. For to the Divine nature of Chriſt was the humane nature given, fitted, and perſonally united in time, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.16.<note place="margin">Heb. 10.5.</note> To him according to both na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures was given in time the office of a Mediatour betweene God offended and men offending. To him as God and man was the Name above all Names given, and in that Name doth the Father, the Sonne, and the Holy Ghoſt in time above and below of Angels and men receive the glory of our redemption, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.13.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> and others expound it of Chriſt as the Sonne of God. <hi>Hoc natus accepit ut poſt crucem manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retur,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:54419:17"/>
quid a Patre, dum generaretur, acceperit,</hi> this Name he received being borne, that what he received of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his generation might be manifeſted after he was crucified. That is, as <hi>Zanchius</hi> openeth the Fathers minde, in the eternall generation God the Father communicated to the Sonne that hee ſhould be true God, remaine ſo in the aſſumed fleſh, and after the Reſurrection be every where ſo proclaimed.</p>
               <p>The truth is, both theſe are to be conjoyned. For he that was ever, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a Saviour according to his Deity, is now for ever, and, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, inchangeably Jeſus according to his humanity alſo. Not that what the ſonne of God is, as the Sonne of man, is he. Chriſt, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, eſſentially God is man, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, by the Union. The Deity is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted really to the fleſh, but not communicated really. By the identity of the Perſon the Name reacheth both natures. Jeſus is the ſonne of God, and the Sonne of Man is Jeſus. <hi>Tota res Nominis eſt perſona,</hi> the whole thing of the Name is the Perſon. God onely is not it, nor onely Man it, God and Man, one Chriſt, is all. The Name then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes all the Attributes of God and Man, and more then of God and Man, <hi>ſeorſum,</hi> ſeverally, all of God and Man united.</p>
               <p>And here the Argument for the exaltation of the Name is yet more evident. Such a perſon is Chriſt, as not the like, and therefore ſuch a Name is Jeſus as no ſuch. Not that this Name addes an higher degree to Gods eſſence, or to his eſſentiall glory. But this Name ſhewing the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of God and man, ſhewes alſo that in this Name God will by his Church, in Heaven and on Earth, and by his enemies on Earth and in Hell, be moſt glorified. Nor that his Name doth make an inequality in the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.<note place="margin">Ambroſ. l. <hi>2.</hi> de Sp. Sancto. c. <hi>12</hi>
                  </note> For as Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaid, on <hi>Matthew</hi> 11.27. <hi>Plus dixit de filio quam de patre, non quod plus habet, quam pater, ſed quod ne minus eſſe videatur,</hi> the text ſpeaketh more of the Sonne then of the Father; not becauſe the Sonne hath more authority then the Father: but becauſe the Sonne ſhould not ſeeme to be inferiour to the Father. So is it
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:54419:17"/>
ſaid, the Father hath given all authority to him, and all things are put under him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.27. Not that he is exalted above the Father, but there is nothing which ſhall not be ſubject un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt, he excepted, who ſubjecteth all things to him. And though he be the Judge of quicke and dead, he is not Judge onely; but he and not the Father doth judge, <hi>in forma vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibili,</hi> in a viſible forme. So neither doth the Name given him above all names ſeclude the Father and the Holy Ghoſt from the act of Salvation, but ſheweth that our Salvation appointed by the eternall purpoſe was finiſhed in the perſon of the Son. And becauſe all was finiſhed in Jeſus, that Name is the Name, wherein the glorious Trinity, as appeares throughout the New Teſtament, will be honoured for ever and ever. So be it now and ever; and let all people ſay Amen.</p>

                  </gap>. For there Chriſt is conſubſtantiall with the Father, and the Name of Jeſus above every Name in many reſpects, is in no reſpect inferiour to any. The <hi>Neſtorians,</hi> that ſeigne one perſon of the Deity, another of the humanity; the <hi>Apollina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſts,</hi> that convert the word into the fleſh; the <hi>Arrians,</hi> that yeeld the Name to Chriſt as man made a God in repute, not as God made man indeed; and the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> who preſumptuouſly arrogate Chriſts ſaving Name, are condemned at <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, and ſtill the argument is the Union and our Salvation.</p>
               <p>True Chriſtians we conſidering wherefore God exalted Chriſt, beleeve that for the Union and for us he ſpread abroad his Name. God and Man being knowne to be one, we know that men have grace with God. He being notified to us wee take notice of him. The Eſſence of things is brought to our underſtanding by ſecond notions. For in the cloud of our firſt fall, we ſo loſt the ſight of all things in their being, that now we ſee not the Eſſence but by expreſſion. Of the higheſt expreſſion the ſubſtance is the higheſt. That Name then, which containes all, God and us, and our ſalvation, is the fulleſt. That God fully manifeſted by the viſible ſending of the Holy Ghoſt, and that is acknowledged, in Heaven, on Hearth, and in Hell, to be Jeſus. This ſounds glory to God in the higheſt, on Earth peace to the elect, and in Hell terrour to the Devils. No name like this for ſweetneſſe; it brings God to us, and carries us to God. No Name like this in power; it delivers us not onely out of the power of our enemies, but chaines them in eternall torments alſo. To God, to us, in it ſelfe moſt delightfull. Nothing above it, and below it all things. Nor aſcribe we this to the ſecond intention, we receive it not without the firſt. The perſon with the Name, and not the Name without the perſon. Not part, but whole Chriſt apprehend we at the Name of Jeſus. Nor doe we extend it beyond the proper ſubject. The
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:54419:18"/>
Sonne of <hi>Nun</hi> had it not, nor any other as Chriſt: Chriſt actively to ſave, others paſſively to be ſaved. They reſigned that they had to him, he will not reſigne his unto any. Who therefore impropriate this to be called thereby, againſt them we determine, that they endeavour, as much as in them is, to bring it beneath it ſelfe. It is blaſphemy not to regard it as his, much more to remove it from him. For God hath given him, and none but him, the Name, <hi>which is above every Name.</hi>

               <p>VVE are now proceeded from the exaltation of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Name by God, unto the exaltation of the Name and Perſon by us. Which God exalted, we are here en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned by him to exalt both. Not the Name without the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, nor either according to our humours, but after his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription. Not inwardly alone, and alwayes, nor outwardly alone at any time. Outwardly and inwardly, that who ſaved the outward and inward, may by both be acknowledged the Saviour of body and ſoule. The text is plaine, and the duty pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely ſet. Firſt, of the <hi>Knee; that at the Name of Jeſus it ſhould bow.</hi> Secondly, of the <hi>Tongue; that it ſhould confeſſe, that Jeſus Chriſt is Lord.</hi> Nor is this of ſome, and not others, but of all and every one; <hi>every knee,</hi> and every tongue, in Heaven, on Earth, and under the Earth. All leaves out none. Nor let any thinke that any of this is in vaine, but to the higheſt purpoſe all. For the utmoſt end of the <hi>knees</hi> inſinuation, and the tongues expreſſion, is to the glory of God the Father. Hunt not after figurative con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, beleeve the plain text, doe the worke faithfully; doe ſo, and you ſhall practiſe no more then yee ought, and the duty ſo done will redound to the Majeſty of the incomprehenſible Trinity.</p>

               <p>All was full before. Full the perſon, God and man; full our redemption, God and Man reconciled; full his exaltation, as God and Man; and his Name full to expreſſe all. The full per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the full redemption, the full exaltation, the full Name, all and every one call for full acknowledgement. But full acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement cannot be, if this text be taken tropically. It is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall onely when the joynts are ſtiffe, and the tongue ſtill: and though the ſervice may be right to God in the heart, to others it is not at all knowne to be there without either outward ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection or confeſſion outward. Yea where God hath mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted his Sonne to be the high exalted Saviour of ſoule and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, it is contempt, or at leaſt neglect, if the body and ſoule doe not humbly in the Church ſhew themſelves, as is commanded, to be his ſaved. <hi>Tertullian, Origen, Cyprian, Hierome, Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome, Auguſtine, Cyrill, Bernard,</hi> all the Fathers that ever I ſaw like this conſequence, nor have I yet met with any late Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Writer that contradicts it.

                  </gap>, we will underſtand by, or
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:54419:20"/>
from, then by the Name occaſion is offered, and from the Name a ſound argument drawne for bowing. Or will we have a Pleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſme here, and make a redundance? for in caſe of the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Hebrew, Greeke, and Latin, if <hi>in</hi> be expreſſed, it is not felt, if omitted, it is not required. The Name then expreſſed, or pronounced will be the externall impulſive of genuflection. Or if you will have it periphraſticall, it muſt either be of the Adverb, &amp; then it is namely unto Jeſus; or of the Adjective, and then it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to glorious Jeſus; or of the Verb, and then it is when Jeſus is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. Or will you have it to the Name; then it is in honour of the Name. Or will you have at the Name; then in, or at the mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Jeſus. For what is a Name ſave the expreſſion of a thing? The Greek therefore is emphatically ſet downe, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in or at the very Name. The very Name is the externall mover of the minde unto the internall object. Accept then any one of theſe ſixe takings, and the firſt terme of the Act is the Name Jeſus. That is it, becauſe the Apoſtle ſaith it was therefore given; and no other it, becauſe it is the Name above every Name, as before.</p>
               <p>I would not ſeeme to dazle your eyes, I ſay not to the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the letters, ſyllables, or ſound of the Name, but to the ſenſe. At the Name, that is, when the Name is named, to the perſon whoſe Name is mentioned. At the Name we minde the perſon, and are incited to the duty. This divine motion therefore from the Name is by the Name directed to the end, wherein it reſteth. Nor can we ordinarily proceed otherwiſe. From Names we goe unto things, and without Names we know nothing was at large before.</p>
               <p>Indeed God firſts exalts the perſon, and then gives the Name, he ſees the perſon as he is, but we by his Name diſcerne the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. At the Name beginning, by the moſt highly extolled Name moſt highly we extoll the perſon.</p>
               <p>Shall I illuſtrate it? I will by that, which every one acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth to be juſt. In, or at, or by, or from the conſigned words of the Scriptures we know the truth of God thereby expreſſed; Becauſe we know whoſe they are, and what is contained in them, in, or at, or to the reading, preaching, and hearing of them we addreſſe our ſelves in all reverence with bended knees, uncovered heads, and with hearts, hands, and eyes lifted up unto the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour. Is this damnable ſuperſtition? Or will any ſound-hearted
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:54419:21"/>
Chriſtian thinke it in vaine? Behold, the name at which we bow, diſcovers unto us the ſubſtance of the whole Scriptures. All are to bring us unto Chriſt, and Jeſus is the ſum of all. At the mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning then of that Name were we left to our owne wils, would we not heare, and ſpeak it with honour to our Saviour? Or did the Church only command the reverence thereat, is it not the breach of the firſt Commandement not to doe it? But God requires all manner of honour to his Name, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.7. Chriſt prayed for the due performance thereof, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.9. and here the Holy Ghoſt dictated in what Name the glorious Trinity will be moſt honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and how at that. Who gain-ſaies this, gain-ſaies the Law and Goſpel, and who wilfully damneth it, doth, as much as in him li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, ſhake the very foundation of true Religion. The Father will not have the Name neglected, the Sonne will have it ſanctified, and the Holy Ghoſt ſhewes us how.

To give him ſuch a Name is one; to give him, that for ſuch a one, it ſhould be taken, is another, ſaid the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Biſhop. For given it may be on Gods part, and not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged on ours. Yea if we recall, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, the rationative particle, <hi>that,</hi> it ſeemes God counts not the Name ſo exalted, unleſſe we ſignifie, as he would have us, that we eſteeme it, <hi>ſuper omne Nomen,</hi> above e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Name.</p>
               <p>Indeed they are not few, who make <hi>in,</hi> or <hi>at,</hi> a ſimple note of reſt; and by the Name underſtand the perſon to whom they, and all muſt bow; yet will not onely not doe it themſelves, but tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell ſore to keepe others alſo from it.</p>
               <p>To diſcover how they deceive themſelves, and others, obſerve me a little.</p>
               <p>That in, or at is a note of reſt; that the Name concludes the perſon; that to bow to the perſon is a precept, are true. But theſe, that the whole of in or at, is a note of reſt; that the whole of the Name is the perſon; that the whole of the precept is to bow un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the perſon, are falſe. For the whole of in, or at, is not a note of reſt, as before was proved. Nor is the Name the whole of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but ſignificatively, nor the perſon the whole of the Name, but ſubjectively.

as hath beene already, and ſhall be further opened. But in the Name to bow, that is, in the perſon, is neither from the Letter, nor by any conſequence of the Text. It is <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, and will not hold in common ſenſe. For who can bow in the perſon of God and Man? He once humbled himſelfe for us, but who in his perſon, either when he was in ſwatheling cloathes, ever bowed before <hi>Herod,</hi> or, in the Councell falſely accuſed, before <hi>Pilat.</hi> Much leſſe now he is exalted wants he ſuch humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. Nay, who can bow at his perſon now he is out of our ſight, and above our reach? His Name is with us, then in, or at his Name we may.</p>
               <p>Yet in his perſon, they ſay, becauſe in our proper perſons we are unworthy to accede unto God.</p>
               <p>A very proper ſhift to put off a peculiar duty. It is true, we are unworthy; but I grant not all the reſt, unleſſe at <hi>in,</hi> be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood <hi>by</hi>: For although what we are, we referre to Chriſt, and without him are nothing, yet this is no <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge for the not doing what is commanded. Becauſe it is the precept of God, not an inſtitution only of the Church. The firſt word of this verſe inferres the one, and <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>We therefore reſting in Chriſt, who repoſed all his in himſelfe for us, every one in his proper perſon, body and ſoule, by the perſon intervening, worſhip God. For his Majeſty, hid of it ſelfe, exiſting <gap reason="foreign">

A worke that ſhewes his ſuper-exaltation indeed. He is exalted to whoſe perſon we bow; but he, at whoſe Name onely, much more. Bowing then, not at the perſon onely, as ſome, nor at the glory onely of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as others, which are both out of our ſight: Nor at the power onely of the perſon, as many, which ſets no time for the act; but at the Name alſo which is below, and hath a time with us, we ſhew our high reſpect of him in his power, and glory.

Maſter <hi>Giles Widdowes,</hi> maintaines it ſtoutly againſt the lawleſſe, kneeleſſe Schiſmaticall Puritan. And it at this day is Preached and practiſed by the moſt learned in the Kingdome.</p>
               <p>In all Churches, old and new; Eaſterne and Weſterne, Romiſh and Reformed this Expoſition hath beene well liked. Maſter <hi>Cartwright</hi> knew not what to ſay againſt it, and therefore his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers cannot abide it.</p>
               <p>We dare not ſo much as ſpeake of an earthly King unreverent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Dare we not? Then what reverence doe we owe unto Chriſt the King of Heaven and Earth? ſaith Maſter <hi>Perkins</hi> on this Text. We owe much indeed, and have promiſed much, but God helpe,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> in his expoſition of the Creede.</note> we performe little, and our little performance hath made a great diſturbance in the Church of <hi>England.</hi> So great that this very du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Text is by too many held ſuperſtition. Certainely there is irreligion in them that ſo vainely handle the Text, but in the duty can be no ſuperſtition. For the Apoſtle ſaith it is done at the Name unto the glory of the Father. From whom it hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, in him it ends. Where it is ſo done, is no vaine honoring of that which ſhould not be honoured, and therefore no ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition.</p>
               <p>But grant there hath beene ſuperſtition uſed in it,<note place="margin">Zanch. in loc.</note> as <hi>Zanchius</hi> ſaith, there was in bowing of the head, and many other godly conſtitutions.

What will you doe then? will you abandon hearing? God forbid. Remove, ſaith Biſhop <hi>Andrewes,</hi> the ſuperſtition; and retaine Sermons ſtill. Doe but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſo here, and all is at an end. We may be in fault, the duty can be in none. If the fault be in us, we ought to amend. Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription may not be annihilated for our miſcarriage. It is excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:54419:25"/>
to ſweepe ſuperſtition out of the Church; but chiefe wiſdome not to ſweepe any of Gods Religion out with it. Reverence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to abate on all hands, I pray God, that we by this guile of the devill may never loſe our Religion.</p>
               <p>It is not the crying ſuperſtition, and damnable ſuperſtition, that can make it ſuch. Stop we our eares at ſuch foule blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: Looke to the Text, follow it, and pay, as God requireth, a reverent carriage even to his Sonnes Name. What God hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted, exalt we and feare not. For God being honoured by it, we, at the generall day, ſhall, when all knees muſt bow at once, find comfort, that we on earth have ſo bowed at the Name of Jeſus.</p>
               <p>What the Name ſignifies, and why at this name rather then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other, was in the former Verſe.</p>
               <p>If any inſinuate the minde, that thus exalting the Name, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre one perſon before another in the Trinity: It is anſwered, that cannot be. For God will have us this way declare that we acknowledge Jeſus to be Lord equall with the Father, and the Holy Ghoſt; and that he received this Name, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his humane nature, which he ever poſſeſſed in himſelfe according to the divine. The Text therefore is not ſimply at the name,<note place="margin">

                     </gap>.</note> but at the Name of Jeſus. Which is the Name of one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon conſiſting of two natures, divine and humane, as before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>At the Name</hi> then <hi>of Jeſus</hi> inferres that the whole perſon is to be adored; the word and the fleſh, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </note> as the Fathers in the Councell of <hi>Epheſus</hi> defined. The worſhip may not be divided, becauſe undivided is the perſon. Yet true it is, that the Godhead, by and of it ſelfe ſimply, ought to be worſhipped, and not the fleſh, ſave in the perſon, and for the Godhead. But ſeeing the Apoſtle directs the worſhip to the whole perſon,<note place="margin">Zanch. in loc.</note> 
                  <hi>Non eſt cur ab adoratione deitatis ſeparetur caro,</hi> there is no reaſon why the fleſh ſhould be ſeparated from the honour of the Deity, ſaith <hi>Zanchius.</hi> And if it be <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, the free and ſuperexcellent dignity of power and domination above all?</p>
               <p>In this adoration then is nothing taken from the Father, or from the Holy Ghoſt, and given to the Sonne? nor any thing gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Son, which is not equally to the honour of the three
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:54419:25"/>
perſons in the unity of the eſſence. But hereby is manifeſted, that the perſon vilified in this Name, was the Sonne of God and Man, and is now in the ſame Name to be adored by all as God and Man, which cannot be ſaid of the Father, or of the Holy Ghoſt. Of the Sonne alone, becauſe he onely was incarnate, and yet, as I have ever taught, to the glory of the moſt tranſcendent Trinity.</p>
               <p>It is apparent now, that we cautelouſly obſerving the idiotiſme vary not from the ſenſe of the phraſe. At the Name we reſt not vainely in the ſound, but are carried to the ſubſtance of the name, or object of our faith, the perſon of Jeſus Chriſt. Not to the humane nature, <hi>Seorſum, &amp; per ſe,</hi> ſeverally, and by it ſelfe. For ſo doing we divide the perſon, overthrow the communication of proprieties, and the due unto the Creator we render to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which is Idolatry. Yea, if in our worſhip we can conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Father, the Sonne, and the Holy Ghoſt, three ſubſiſtences, and one ſubſtance; yet all this availes not, unleſſe we take with us our Mediatour. If we mind not a true Man-hood, gloriouſly united to the God-head, without change of either nature, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mixture of both, whoſe preſence, whoſe merits muſt give paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, vigour, and acceptance, our prayers aſcend in vaine. At this worke thoughts ſhould be holily mixed of a God-head and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, two natures in one perſon, and of the ſame Deity in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers perſons, and one nature. Beſtirre our ſelves we ought ſo to diſtinguiſh theſe apprehenſions, that none be neglected, ſo to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyne them, that they be not confounded. We ſin, if fixing the heart on one, we exclude the other: retaining all and mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning one we offend not. Who reſt their thoughts upon the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity muſt ſtill adore the Deity, and thence climbe up unto the holy conſideration of the bleſſed Trinity. For in Jeſus onely is that Myſtery revealed to us, and through him onely is our wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip directed to the ſacred Trinity in Unity. Following this ſhort weake counſell, ſtudy and pray that you may apprehend right, and worſhip well. Be thus minded, and bowing at the name you ſhall not be ſuperſtitious. Bow and honour Jeſus heartily: for the more we honour him, the more we honour the whole Trinity. If you cannot beleeve me, yet let not the Apoſtle miſſe your faith. It is Gods command, he ſaith, and therefore our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Minding the one, we ſhall not forget to pay the other. Ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour

               <p>The Jewes, Infidels, and Philoſophers, that abjure, ſcorne, and deride the Name of Jeſus; the Schiſmatickes, whether Cathariſts, Anabaptiſts, Browniſts, Separatiſts, or whatſoever called, that neglect, and contemne all manner of outward reverence at this Name; the Papiſts, that ſuperſtitiouſly uſe it, and the Prophane, that in their debauchedneſſe, moſt impiouſly blaſpheme it, are condemned at <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> for there the Holy Ghoſt will have the Name ſuper-exalted by God, by us alſo ſuper-exalted with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and honour.

                  </gap>, and ſtill the argument is the union, and our Salvation.</p>
               <p>True Chriſtians we ſeeing that God hath exalted the perſon and the Name, and knowing why, are bound in conſcience for the ſame reaſon to exalt the Name and Perſon. Not according to our owne humours, but in Analogy of that Truth, which is ſet forth for us to beleeve and doe. We ſeeke no by-wayes to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyd the duty, nor lead we others from it. A plaine Text para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lleled by others literally, muſt we underſtand properly, as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are. The truth expreſſed in the Letter cannot be miſtaken, but by a figurative conſtruction the Letter may be forced to a wrong ſenſe. The ſenſe of the former verſe, which is the ground of this, being literall, makes this literall alſo. We have proved it ever ſo conceived in the Church, and will not alter it now. Nay dare not; becauſe we are ſure that by the third commandement, and the firſt petition Gods Name, whether ſpoken, read, heard, or written, muſt have reverent uſage. And if it muſt, may we deny that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:54419:26"/>
which himſelfe hath expreſſely preſcribed? The anathema ſounds ſtill in our eares, Curſed be he, that taketh from, or addeth to. If God then will have outward worſhip exhibited at the Name, in the Name of God let him have it. If he will be ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, that is reaſon enough, why he ſhould. But he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven reaſons ſtore, if we will not doe it now, we are now in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and without repentance ſhall be without excuſe hereafter. Nor may we thinke to leave the duty undone, becauſe ſome count it ſuperſtition. Indeed at the Name, and no more were vaine. But at the Name to <hi>bow</hi> unto our Saviour is one way we worſhip him, and we have no other way to come at him, ſave by his Name. He is gone, his Name is left, that by his Name we may minde him, and through him adore the bleſſed Trinity. At the Name there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let the heart aſcend unto the perſon, and outward obeyſance expreſſe our faith in, and high eſteeme of whole Chriſt. As true God, and true man; for as God and man he is exalted in perſon and Name, <hi>that at the Name of Jeſus every Knee ſhould bow.</hi>

               <p>If the Fathers call it ſubjection, adoration, or worſhip; what if they doe? May it not therefore come at the body? Nay, the outward bowing proceeding from the lowly minde, unto the right object is the reall and full ſubjection, adoration, or worſhip, which God requireth at the Name. For the bowing of the <hi>Knee</hi> is not onely a ſigne of inward ſubjection, but being with the heart is true ſubjection it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Adoration it is, and to adore is to honour in the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, that is with the loweſt expreſſion. For in adoration is ever implyed a threefold act.

               <p>The argument is pitifull: Hypocrites draw neare with their lips, therefore true Chriſtians may not uſe theirs in the ſervice of God.

               <p>But that was in prayer; True, then we bow loweſt, when we name Jeſus unto God. But is the act lawfull then, and may it not be lawfull, when God in his word, or by his Miniſters names Jeſus unto us? Is not prayer an humble acknowledgement of our unworthineſſe, and Gods ſuperiority? Is bowing at the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:54419:30"/>
Name of Jeſus any leſſe, or any more? Yea no man ſues unto God, and not in, or at his Name. If we be not prepared to carry it before us, our petitions will be preferred in vaine. For God heares us not except we come in that Name, nor can we ſee how to honour him, but through it. In, or at, or through it, as was before expreſſed, we may.</p>
               <p>Bow the Knee the devout will at prayer, and at the Sacrament of the Lords body, and bloud. It is well, and wiſhed that all would: examples I know, are ſtore in the old and new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the one, but none for the other. Nor can any produce a more evident precept for either, then this, <hi>that at the Name of Jeſus every Knee ſhould bow.</hi> For we beginning prayer in his Name, conclude with it: and the Sacrament of the Lords Supper is the moſt lively expreſſion of Jeſus to our ſoules. So is the one, and the other ſo. Why then is not the naming, or mentioning of Jeſus ſufficient reaſon of <hi>geniculation</hi>? The perſon ſignified to us, and by us minded is the ſame, and we are ſure the text is plaine for this whilſt we inferre the other.</p>

firſt reformation obſerved it thus in the ſpeciall time of Divine Service. For at the generall confeſſion of our ſinnes acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Jeſus to be Lord we kneele. When the Apoſtles Creed is rehearſed we bow the knee, head and all. When the ſecond Leſſon is read, if we ſit, yet we bow at the Name, and at the Goſpel we bow ſtanding. Sitting or ſtanding when the word is read, or preached, we bow at the Name of Jeſus.</p>
               <p>This precept then is now obſerved, but the full obſervance is not extant now, nor ever will be in this world. For God raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth now by the Goſpel,<note place="margin">Calv. in Rom. <hi>14.</hi> v. <hi>11.</hi>

               <p>Grace doth owe her knees, and her knees are not in, but gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the heart. With heart and knee, bowing at the Name, we both teſtifie that he is Lord, who died to ſave ſinners, and retribute glory for the ineſtimable benefit. For the meaning of the Holy Ghoſt is ſimply to affirme, ſaith he,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> that all men ſhould not onely acknowledge Chriſts power with the heart, but by externall ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of the body, which he noteth by the bowing of the knee, ſhew forth the yeelding of obedience alſo. But the word of God hath alwayes enemies, that frowardly reſiſt, and contemners, that prophanely ſcoffe at it, as trifling, or fabulous. At this day are many ſuch, God amend them, and give his children patience till all things be renewed. Such there are, and ever will be ſcorners.<note place="margin">Areti. in loc.</note> Whereby it appeareth that this bowing is indeed begun in this life, not perfected. When all the enemies of Chriſt ſhall be thrown downe, that they may be the footſtoole of his feete, then at the Name of Jeſus ſhall every knee bow, <hi>ad plenum,</hi> of thoſe in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, in earth, and under the earth.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Patricians</hi> that deny the ſubſtance of humane fleſh to be of God; the <hi>Paternians,</hi> that give the inferiour parts of mans body as peculiar to the ſervice of the Devill; the nefarious <hi>Poſtellus</hi> of <hi>Sorbon,</hi> that ſaid his Harlot and not Chriſt, redeemed us from the navill downeward; all Hereticks alſo, that worſhip in ſpirit, not in truth; all Hypocrites that worſhip neither in ſpirit, nor in truth, but in ſhew; and all luke-warme Chriſtians who have ſome affection, yet becauſe many will breake, leaving the Church, and God too, rather then bend, doe keepe the knee for their own uſe, or bring it into Gods ſervice, as if they were aſhamed it ſhould

                  </gap>. For the whole of man according to every part is Gods, and the outward worſhip proceeding from the inward, the knee at times to expreſſe the obedience of the heart, doth he challenge of every one. All Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, or indifferent ſoules, <hi>Halceſaits</hi> I may call them, that hold it equall to bow, or not to bow; all Jewes, Turks, and Pagans, that yeeld no obedience unto Jeſus; all <hi>Agnoclyts, Ethicoproſcopts, Puritans, Anabaptiſts, Browniſts,</hi> or other perturbers of the Church peace, that will not outwardly bow, are condemned at <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>True Chriſtians we are diſciplined by God, as well in the ſtate of our body, as in the habit of our minde. Both being his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, it is moſt juſt they ſhould according to his will be ordered both. He hath not circumſcribed the one, and left the other boundleſſe. Our body muſt pay its due, and the ſoule hers, and not the body without the ſoule, that both may be ſpirituall. We joyne them together; and worſhip not without bodies, but in a ſingular adoration, and on ſpeciall reſtraint. Were we forced to be preſent at idolatry, we may ſubject to God in minde, but not bow downe to <hi>Baal.</hi> Submitting then in heart to God, and not in body to any other, we give all to whom the whole is due. God will have no ſharer; in all places, at all times, upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions the knee muſt be the Lords, and his onely. No man hath licence to reſtraine it, when it may be yeelded, not they whom none controll, ſave God. Kings as well as the meaneſt of the people come under every knee, and are called unto obedience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord. Whilſt they be foremoſt, the people will be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. If the heart be right, of what degree ſoever we be, our necks are not perverſe, nor our knees ſtubborne; well compoſed our bodies, to ſhew our ſoules are ſanctified: we goe not our owne wayes, nor keepe our owne times; what, and as God hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed we are ready to execute without ſcruple. It is kindly not to render other ſervice then he hath ſet forth, but it were ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to barre him any of that. Be it how he wils, whileſt his Name is hallowed by us, our conſciences finde peace in him. At the Name then, and to the perſon, without ſhame, or flattery, or
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:54419:31"/>
puſillanimity, bend we heart and knee. Becauſe the Name is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereminent, and by God made the higheſt; <hi>that at the Name of Jeſus every knee ſhould bow</hi> of thoſe things in Heaven, and in earth, and under the earth.</p>

               <p>But what bodies they naturally have, we are men and know not; certainely more excellent then ours, more ſubtile then the Heavens, inviſible to our blind eyes, finite, locall, and the fitteſt for their miniſtry.</p>
               <p>May we ſay the Angels have their bodies, and can we not think they have their knees? Saint <hi>Paul</hi> at 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.1. gives them tongues, and ſhall he not as well at <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.10. allow them knees?

They doe reverence, and we finde in the Scriptures that they have expreſſions of what they doe. Conſider what is at <hi>Rev.</hi> 4.10. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5.8.14. and in the 7. chapter 11, 12. verſes, nothing can be more plaine. All the Angels ſtood in the compaſſe of the Throne, and of the Elders, and of the foure beaſts, and fell before the Throne on their faces, and worſhipped God; ſaying Amen; <hi>Bleſſing, and glory, and wiſdome, and thankes, and honour, and power, and might be unto our God for ever more, Amen.</hi> They ſtand, and have they no legges? they fall downe, and may they not bow? Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving faces, muſt they want knees? ſpeaking out, are they with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out tongues? They have theirs, we ours.

Their obedientiall bowing power they yeeld in a ſupermorall perfection. The doe ſo, and going before in that practiſe we need not feare to follow after.

The very recognition of Jeſus, whoſe Name the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed glory to record one to another, being perpetuall to the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, ſhall be as bellowes to blow the fire, whileſt they are fuell to maintaine it. They deſpaire to forget him, becauſe his revengefull power will never leave them. Fly from him they cannot, nor are they able to endure, what they muſt for ever and ever abide under him. Thus having no where elſe to be, nor any meanes not at all to be, nor any hope that he will in time be ſatisfied, they yeeld, becauſe they cannot but yeeld; and ſuffer, becauſe they ever ſhall ſuffer the rigour of his juſtice. In this thraldome they dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing advance his Name, whoſe perſon was deſpited, and applaud his juſtice, whoſe mercie they refuſed. That juſtice keepes them on their everlaſting knees, whileſt their Lord cannot be, and not be victorious.</p>
               <p>All therefore ſhall bow, but how bow all at the Name? Shall Jeſus be named at the generall day? or ever after?</p>
               <p>Who queſtion this may doubt all. All that Chriſt did, and ſuffered all. For what gaine I by him crucified, if he be not glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for me? I acknowledge him humbled, much more exalted him, and my ſelfe through him. Beleeve and ſearch the Scriptures. They ſay the Lord ſhall be revealed, and ſhall he be revealed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the memoriall of his Name? Not ſo. The day of the Lord is the revelation of the Lord Jeſus, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.7. And at the 12. <hi>v.</hi> all that is then done, the clarification of the good, and confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the bad, all, that is, is that the Name of our Lord Jeſus may be glorified in us, and we in him.</p>
               <p>Againe, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.14. The generall day is the day of the Lord Jeſus. Shall he have a day, and not he be mentioned in the day? How hath he it, when it is not acknowledged his? But his it is,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:54419:36"/>
and will be acknowledged. For in that day God ſhall judge the ſecrets of men by Jeſus Chriſt according to the Goſpel, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.16.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, when we conſider, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 25.21. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.11. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.11. that every tongue at the generall day ſhall to the full confeſſe that Jeſus Chriſt is Lord, what may we ſay of thoſe men that thus contradict this truth? If they be Schollers, can they be thus ignorant? If Divines, be they not infatuated? and if both, are they not in contempt? I feare they have projected ſo many waves of ſerving God, that if his mercie prevent not, the beſt will be forſaken, or troubled very much.</p>
               <p>But grant that the Name ſhall be mentioned then, ſhall it never be expreſſed after then?</p>
               <p>Yes, for by what Name he was vilified on earth, in the ſame Name will he be magnified in Heaven. All the ſervants of God ſhall there ſee his face, and his Name in their foreheads, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.4. What is the Name there? The Lamb of God is not it, but it is Jeſus. For he is the eternall Sacrifice ſignified by the Lamb. And becauſe our comfort ſhall be alwayes full, the Name, for which we ſuffer on earth, ſhall ever be preſent with us in Heaven. We ſhall heare it alwayes, ſee it alwayes, glory in it alwayes, it will be alwayes in our foreheads. Nay how can we be perfect in him, if his Name ſhall not be glorified in us? 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.12. Or how may his glory be perfect in us, if his titles of greateſt glory be withdrawne from us? Is there any other Name wherein we muſt be ſaved? <hi>Acts</hi> 4.12. we are ſaved onely in it; if ſaved, then glorified in it onely. For without glory is no ſalvation. Poſſeſſe we ſo much in it, and ſhall it be without regard, when we have all we can poſſeſſe?

Shall it be poured forth to them, and not be received? or how can they receive, and not take notice of it? It was the hope of all the Fathers, and the joy of the Martyrs in the Church, that they ſhould magnifie this Name in Heaven, which they profeſſed on earth.

When their doctrine is knowne to be at oddes, they will ſtand amazed, and keepe the diſtance of thoſe men that frighten each other.</p>
               <p>It is time to conclude; who will not beleeve, can never learne their duty, becauſe a duty is never learned till it be practiſed, nor practiſed till it be well beleeved. Have ſome faith, and we ſhall have more, and the more we have the greater will our pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe be.

on earth; therefore good Chriſtians beginne here to bow at the Name. The Name is moſt dreadfull in Hell; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the damned bow at the Name: Theſe againſt the will, moſt willingly the other.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Simonians, Caimies, Angelicies, &amp;c.</hi> that againſt the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures bring in, and maintaine the worſhipping of Angels; the <hi>Collirydians, Papiſts,</hi> that adore the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> alſo, pray unto Saints, and bow the knee at their Images; the <hi>Ariſtoteli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and the Fanatiks of our time, that make the Angels ſuch ſimple intelligences as may no way bow the knee, are condemned at <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. For there the Angels, and Saints receive no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine worſhip, but ſubmiſſively bow downe at the Name. The <hi>Manichees,</hi> that ſay Jeſus is the Redeemer of the ſoule onely, and therefore yeeld not the body unto his honour; the Jewes, Turkes, Pagans, Infidels, that on earth deny his Name; the <hi>Zuinglians,</hi> and our very late Reformiſts, that ſtand covered as ſtiffe as ſtakes, or ſit as ſenſleſſe of Grace, without any expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of honour at the Name of Jeſus, are condemned at <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. For there beleeving Chriſtians, hoping to partake of glory with their Saviour, ſhew their delight in, and high eſteeme of him by bowing at his Name. The <hi>Carpocratians, Marcits, Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> that fall downe before familiar Devils; the <hi>Pythagoreans, Origeniſts,</hi> and many prophane Famuliſts in theſe dayes, that teach a revolution of ſoules, as if Hell were but for a time, and in time the Devill and all the wicked with him ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move thence, as the Popelings ſay ſoules doe out of Purgatory, are condemned at <gap reason="foreign">

For there the Devill, his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and all the Damned, chained for ever on their knees, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie the righteouſneſſe of our Saviour in bowing with horrour at the Name of Jeſus. This and all we maintaine from <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and ſtill the argument is the union, and our ſalvation.</p>
               <p>True Chriſtians we beleeve that though the Angels have not knees like ours, yet will bend the knees they have. We thinke them not elementary, ſpirituall they be. Devoid of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in reſpect of us, but if God be conſidered corporeall they. For where now they are, they cannot now be elſewhere; and being miniſters to us muſt have ſuch a being wherein they may adminiſter. In a being they aſſiſt us, which ſometimes they either
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:54419:37"/>
make viſible, or aſſume another viſible, and by the ſame, in an analogy to us, humbly expreſſe the honour due unto our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. Not coacted, but with alacrity, and ſuch, as if we could behold it, our hotteſt zeale would ſeeme ſtone-cold. They are indued above us, and can doe much, much more, yet we in a holy emulation praying to doe, as they doe, contend after them. We ſhift nothing off that ought to be done, becauſe when we have done the moſt, it is knowne we have done too little here. If the Angels and Spirits, good and bad, properly have no knees, it is certaine we have. Whom it concernes, looke we to ourſelves. We cannot be too forward, no feare of that, in goodneſſe; but our backwardneſſe brings evill enough on us. Whileſt others then be backward, we will be as forward as we can, that our forwardneſſe may prevene Gods anger. We dare not forbeare the knees, and with-hold what elſe we owe at the Name, leſt he take his Name from, and we be not reputed his. To whom he is moſt precious, moſt honourable he among ſinners. Whileſt therefore we have the uſe of our bodies they ſhall ſet forth our obedience. For we finde who will, becauſe they will be in contempt, ſhall at laſt be compelled with ſmiting knees to honour that Name wherein they will then deſpaire of comfort. We may conceive the Devils in their kinde, and the other dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in theirs, manacled without hope of releaſe, crouching at the Name of Jeſus under the immenſe and eternal waight of Gods wrath. So it is decreed, and cannot be altered, that who will not now doe, what he ſhould, ſhall againſt the will hereafter doe what he would not. Jeſus will be honoured in Heaven, and in Hell, we are in the middeſt to make our choyce: who will have Heaven doth his duty unto Chriſt voluntarily on earth; who doth not ſo ſhall be tormented to it in Hell. <hi>For God hath given him a Name above every Name, that at the Name of Jeſus every knee ſhould bow, of things in Heaven, and in earth, and under the earth.</hi>

The knee then, being ſet before the tongue, doth not challenge the more worth, nor the tongue loſe any of its owne. They be marſhalled right, ſaid the reverend Biſhop.

In the ſecond Precept this order is commanded; the practiſe frequent in the Old Teſtament: in the New Chriſt himſelfe fell on his face and prayed; the Apoſtles after him, and the Churches too, betooke themſelves unto their knees at their devotions. As if bowing were a proper preparative to the ſervice of God, or a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture ſo peculiar, that the outward man, nothing elſe, might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the humble heart.

our tongues goe not with our knees, yet our hearts doe. If one, or other, or both be in action, both, or either of them are ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated ever. Nor can we imagine that any one of us may take licence to be otherwiſe then is preſcribed. None ſhould be in ſhew onely, in earneſt all. Nor will any ones earneſt excuſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others hypocriſie or neglect. Every tongue muſt have its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſpirit, and every ſpirit its proper tongue. We deny not any tongue the faculty here granted, nor barre any one the duty here injoyned. Out with it ſay we; for it is an honour to conquer the devill, and this the way. No magicall ſpell, but Chriſts owne warrant; that the powers of hell ſhall not prevaile againſt it. It ever was, is, and will be ever the glorious exerciſe of the bleſſed in heaven; and maugre all oppoſition, the religious on earth hoping to be perfect Saints at laſt, with all our might uphold the practiſe here. Yea who will not now, ſhall in the end be compelled, and doe it with the devill and his angels, in hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of heart and confuſion of face, with yelling tongues, and gnaſhing teeth for evermore. Conſidering this, whom the love and feare of God can move, the Apoſtles argument ſufficeth us. To ſave his choſen, and confound our enemies, Chriſt at his going rode on the triumphall Charet hence; and is ſet down on the Throne of God, to be the Judge of quicke and dead. All ſhall be ſubdued unto him, his is the power, the Kingdome his, and therefore every tongue ſhould confeſſe that Jeſus Chriſt is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</p>

Who would ſave it, Jew and Gentile, from ſinne muſt be reckoned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſinners. He therefore being the Sonne of the Higheſt, the lower he appeared for us, the more he ſhewed his love. For in that eſtate not loſing his owne all his gaines redound to us. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he could not be unlorded in ours, we are dignified in his. Not ſo, as if he having ſerved our turnes, we ſhould no longer ſerve him: but that, his annointing deſcending on us, we might walke in the odour of his unguents. He the conſtituted Prieſt, to mediate by redemption and interceſſion; we his ſanctified to offer in faith, the fruits of regeneration, prayers, praiſes, good workes, and a holy life. He the Prophet, by the Word and the Spirit to inſtruct; we the Diſciples to beare the characters of the one, and ſet forth the graces of the other. He the King, ruling in might, and mercie to preſerve; we the ſubjects in feare, obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and faithfulneſſe to obſerve his pleaſure, in fighting againſt the enemies, and maintaining the peace of his Kingdom. Such we confeſſe him, and our ſelves ſuch confeſſours: through him. Nor is this all: Our King, our Prophet, our Prieſt, our Saviour is not tranſiently ours, but eternall he. Not now and not hereafter, the ſame now and ever. What comfort have we? We being annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſhall never be feared; nor ever fleeced being his ſaved. For Jeſus Chriſt is ſtill that Lord, which, the Sonne of God he, was before the Incarnation. He hath the Keyes to unlocke Heaven, and the Keyes to locke up Hell. In whoſe hands we are, none can ſnatch us from him. Becauſe he is that being whence all things have being; and the immutable God having elected us will never alter his purpoſe. That he will not, we can domon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate that. He informes us by his Word, confirmes us by his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and repleniſheth our hearts with heavenly deſires. Our thoughts, our words, our workes, tend to him. And ſuch is our reverence in adoring, that if an unbeleever ſhould be preſent at our publike ſervice, he falling downe would ſay, Verily God is among us, and with us confeſſe that Jeſus Chriſt is Lord to the glory of God the Father.</p>

               <p>And though as man he by the union obtained this increated glory in reſpect of his perſon, yet we deprive him not of the created, wherein his humane nature reſides by reall partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation.

And neither the one way, nor the other for himſelfe. For us Chriſt was aſſumed unto and abides in both. Both are fully manifeſted in him, that we through him aſſured to be glorified perfectly, might with full voyce, heart, and tongue, confeſſe him Lord in, and of the glory.

The Father is not without the Sonne, nor the Holy Ghoſt without both: the Sonne then being the Character of the Father, we behold the Father in the Sonne, and the Holy Ghoſt too: becauſe he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from them both.

For we never divide the three perſons in our worſhip of any one; who doe are Idolaters. We honour one, and all; all in the Trinity, or none. Bowing then at the Name unto the Perſon, through the ſenſe of Jeſus, the Father hath glory and the Holy Ghoſt. The Holy Ghoſt by the Apoſtle commands it: if obedience be acceptable, I am ſure in doing it we obey him. And if we can beleeve the Apoſtle, our owne eyes will tell us, that with the Sonne the Father is thereby glorified. For the bowing to, and the confeſſing of Jeſus injoyned by the Spirit are both expreſſed, to the glory of God the Father. The Sonne admits of no glory, which ſhall impaire his Fathers in the leaſt degree. And ever be it our glory to give him all his due. <hi>Tibi,</hi>

Glory in filiation, glory in election; glory in creation, glory in redemption; glory in the Old Teſtament, glory in the New; glory in ſalvation, glory in damnation for ever and ever. The glory, above which no glory, is Chriſts. The bleſſed Virgin, Saints, and Angels, enjoy the peaee of it; but no man, ſave he that is God, may challenge it. He may; for being one with the Father, and the Holy Ghoſt, neither the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nor the Holy Ghoſt can deprive him. Where there are all, and all three one, the glory cannot be to one, and not full to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one. For the Father, the Sonne, and the Holy Ghoſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but one God, the manner of their being, the ſecond of the firſt, and the third from both, doth not ſeparate one and another. It is Eſſence and Eſſence, not ſubſiſtence and ſubſiſtence, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrowes Unity in Trinity. Nor may we inferre that the Sonne and Holy Ghoſt are not, or be leſſe advanced here then the Father; Becauſe he is expreſſed, and not the other. No ſuch concluſion: our ſenſe apprehends it otherwiſe: The Sonne hath his manner of exiſting of the Father, and the Holy Ghoſt from both. This glory therefore is aſcribed to the Father as the Fountaine, which in abſolute conſideration doth alike pertaine to the other perſons. When the Father is mentioned, we in minde conceive the other perſons alſo. For no man knowes the Father, but by the Sonne, nor any man the Sonne, but by the Holy Ghoſt. Confeſſing then the Sonne we confeſſe all, and the Father having the glory of our confeſſion the other have it alſo. The Father hath it to himſelfe, the Sonne in the Father, and the holy Ghoſt in them both.</p>
               <p>We can now tell what compaſſeth the text, and goeth all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it. The firſt word we have brought through all unto the laſt, and carried the laſt clauſe unto the firſt. The true pointing makes it cleare, and ſets forth the exaltation, by God of the Perſon and Name, and of the Name and Perſon by us, in theſe particulars. Firſt, wherefore, that is, for the union, and for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> our Salvation God hath highly exalted him in, and to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God the Father.

We, by the helpe of God, will extoll the ſuper-exalted Name and Perſon with knee and tongue in faith and hope, humbly confeſſing that Jeſus Chriſt is Lord in and to the glory of God the Father.</p>

               <p>Firſt, how? By humility: For the ſame minde muſt be in us, that was in Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>v.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>Secondly, of whom? Of Jeſus Chriſt: For he is the Lord of glory, <hi>v.</hi> 9.10, 11.</p>
               <p>He is the example; humility our worke; and glory the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>

Indeed others may move our emulation, <hi>imitandi imitatores Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſti,</hi> but Chriſt ſhould ſtill be ſeene in them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.1. Saint <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> therefore, 1 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 2.21. ſaith, that Chriſt hath left himſelfe, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, an example to us that we may doe after his forme. None may deprive him of that honour: for it was one of the principall cauſes of his incarnation, that we which would be as Gods, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.5. might be conformed unto the Image of the Sonne of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29.

               <p>But how are we conformed? By imitating him. Not that God juſtifieth us for this imitation, but being juſtified freely by his grace, we by ſuch imitation ſhow our free juſtiftication in Chriſt. For who abide in, walke after him, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.6. No feare of <hi>Socinianiſme</hi> here. If ſinne be ours by propagation, and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe by imputation, we have neither the one nor the other by imitation. This granted, the propoſition is very true. Wee ought to imitate Chriſt wherein we may, and the more we doe, the more we are ſanctified through him. For though the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe of juſtification be not inherent in us, yet the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſanctification is, and is more and more by good workes. The other is perfect at once, this by degrees: That produceth, and the particulars of this be the proceeds.</p>
               <p>Who are aſſured of the firſt, ever looke after the ſecond, and that way, wherein they never ſhall miſcarry.

Wherein his love exceeded thereto he holds us ſtrictly. And the more, becauſe ſuch humiliation is moſt contrary to the fleſh. For pride which gave man his fall muſt be ejected before he can riſe. The Apoſtle therefore weighing this proſecutes us with the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt argument. If the Sonne of God made himſelfe of no repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in our nature humbling himſelfe unto the moſt reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full death for us, will not the ſonnes of men be humble before him?

               <p>Humility was the ſigne, that the Angels gave at his comming into the world, and muſt be our token to the world, that we are going unto him.

is nothing to that immenſe waight of glory, which followeth our Chriſtian contempt of earthly things. While we looking on the things, which are not ſeene, the momentany lightneſſe of our tribulation prepareth unto us a reward, <gap reason="foreign">

He could promiſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better, nothing greater, life, ſalvation, glory, peace, all excellencies, he will be all in all. He will; and therefore ſure we that our meaſure ſhall be filled up with his goods. What they are none can conceive, ſave who receive them. Nor they compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, becauſe the object of happineſſe is infinite. Indeed what is created for us will be according to the receivers. Finite it, and therefore not the ſatisfying ſave in the object. It is not the chiefe good, but enables us to contemplate in Chriſt after our meaſure the <hi>Summum bonum,</hi> which God himſelfe is. This is it; for it is God that doth ever ſatiate, and never cloy.</p>
               <p>And though I have called this the reward of our humility, yet it may not be ſaid that our humility merits this. No, it was purchaſed for us by the humiliation of Jeſus. In whom we have it, without him we challenge nothing. Hoping therefore to be glorified with him in Heaven, to him we conforme on earth. And becauſe he hath taught no other way to the inheritance, then he went in the purchaſe, we ſeeke no other, nor can we thinke there might be any other more glorious.

And when we ſee his humble members deſpiſing the world, yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing no man; contemning themſelves, and yet contemning that contempt, which perſecutes them, doe we not behold the minde exalted above all things below? Yea when we finde pride it ſelfe palliated with humility, know we not that the proud confeſſe there is glory both in, and for the vertue.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:54419:57"/>How in ſeeming not miſtaken is the world miſtaken much? men thinke humility and glory oppoſits; as if of both in one could be no ſubſiſtence.

               <p>My cloſe is: for Chriſt, for the vertue, for the glories ſake learne we the Apoſtles counſell. Keepe we our eyes fixed on the example of Jeſus, and in proceeding the nearer we come to our place, like naturall bodies, we ſhall move with the more celerity. Our humility will carry us, and with ſpeed enough, unto the ſame journies end it brought him. Who drawes us in the way, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.4. will crowne us in the end, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.10. Doing what he commands, we ſhall receive what he obtained, life eternall in and to the glory of God the Father.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Samoſatenians,</hi> and <hi>Socinians,</hi> that hold Chriſts death neither ſatisfactory, nor meritorious, but onely exemplary for us; The Jewes, Turkes, Pagans, Infidels, to whom Chriſt is a ſcorne, and his Croſſe an offence; The Atheiſts, Nullifidians, Prophane, that in diriſion of Gods Religion, call his Church Satans Synagogue, the Communion <hi>Bacchus</hi> Sacrifice, and his profeſſours <hi>Solifidians</hi>; The Libertines of our age that count us fooles for our Auſterity; The careleſſe Profeſſours that deeme us over pitifull to others, too bitter to our ſelves; Our Church <hi>Michals, Cathariſts, Browniſts, Separatiſts,</hi> that deride us for our humiliation in the ſervice of God; The <hi>Anabaptiſts, Monks, Hypocrites,</hi> that will be humble without ſubmiſſion, poore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out want, and rich without labour; The <hi>Sadduces, Simonians, Saturnians, &amp;c.</hi> that hoping there is no puniſhment after this life for the bad, will have no reward for the good; The <hi>Cerin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, Pepuzians, Mahumetans,</hi> that place happineſſe in the eternal fruition of fleſhly delights on earth; And the <hi>Montaniſts, Enthyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſts, Papiſts,</hi> that in the argument of the glory put the merit on themſelves, are condemned by the Apoſtles counſell in the ſixth verſe, and his inference, at the ninth verſe. For there, the fabrick of glory, that Chriſt built up for us, being founded on his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in ſuch humiliation, we are taught to ſhew our gaines by
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:54419:58"/>
following his example. Whoſe redeemed we are, his humble ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants we. If glory be the reward, we have no cauſe to ſtand upon the worke. Be it in what degree he pleaſe, we need not be abaſhed at the humility. For who was the loweſt on earth we are ſure our Saviour is the higheſt exalted in Heaven. When we have done our part God will give us our right in him. This and all we main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine from <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and ſtill the argument is the Union and our ſalvation.</p>
               <p>True Chriſtians we, finding how hard we are beſet with, and prone to evill, looke alwayes on our Captaine, and attend his word for feare we ſhould miſtake his diſcipline. We know how great a Conquerour he is, and that he can never faile in his direction; if our actions vary from, we have not well minded him. And though he be taken out of our ſight, his life is left with us, and reading it we have inſtruction ſtore and ſure. Sure, if we follow it cloſe, right, &amp; be alwayes ſure to it. Nor is it infallible in one and not in all. Whereof he hath given plenty, there is no doubt of any one. Nor is the number of his precepts either large beyond our memory, or ſhort to leave out any thing, that might further us. The example he hath given is moſt abſolute. It de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrates all things that are to be contemned, and ſuſtained all. In them is no felicity to be had, in theſe no unhappineſſe to be feared. He bid us come and ſee, and we moſt ambitious to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, what here we beleeve, will goe no other way, then himſelfe went, and appointed for us. A low way, Chriſt humble; a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect way, Chriſt the truth; and a comfortable way, Chriſt the life. Having truth we are ſure to have cheere in, and life by our humility. It is not the ſimilitude thereof, but the vertue we meane. That is it, and nothing being more acceptable to God, we doe in nothing more, nor in any thing without it, expect a bleſſing. For nothing in us doth more exalt God, and our innate evill is repreſſed by nothing more. All the Lords commands are obſerved with it, and the vertue which ſprings not from that roote withers. Indeed love makes up all breaches, but we have no other meanes to repaire charity ſave humility. In whom all was made up, all was done in humility, and who partake of all, we, like him, will be humble to all. To God in the loweſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; to his Vice-gerent next; we have no envie for our Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:54419:58"/>
nor hatred to our equals, nor contempt toward our inferiours. Love for God, and ſuch, as will permit nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, not our ſubſtance, not our lives. And love for our neighbour, and ſuch, as will pray for every one, and forgive e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very offence. The true knowledge of our ſuperexalted Head rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth our converſation unto Heaven whileſt we live on earth. And well may: For we behold the eternall glory prepared for the meeke incomprehenſible in the object. The faith whereof hath made our appetites ſo eager, that they can leave the greateſt alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives of the world with contempt. Whoſe ſervants we are to him faithfull we may challenge of him our inheritance, who purchaſed it for us. And with boldneſſe, ſeeing in humility, and according to his preſcription we leave all to profeſſe him our high exalted Lord in, and to the glory of God the Father. To whom with the Sonne and the Holy Ghoſt be the Kingdome, and the power, and the glory, for ever and ever. Amen, Amen.</p>
