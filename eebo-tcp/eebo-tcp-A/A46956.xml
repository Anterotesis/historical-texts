            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Letter from a <hi>Freeholder,</hi> to the rest of the <hi>Freeholders of ENGLAND,</hi> and all Others, who have Votes in the Choice of <hi>Parliament-Men.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE Power of <hi>Parliaments,</hi> when they are duly Elected, and rightly Convened, is so very Great, that every man, who has any share in the Choice of them, has the weight of his whole Country lying upon him: For it is possible for my single Vote to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the Election of that Parliament-Man, whose single Vote in the Parliament-House, may either save or sink the Nation. And therefore it behoves men, who thus dispose both of themselves and their Posterity, and of their whole Country at once, to see that they put all these into safe hands, and to be as well advis'd, as much in earnest, when they chuse Persons to serve in <hi>Parliament,</hi> as they usually are when they make their last Will and Testament. And if this is to be done at all times, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a much greater proportion of Care is to be taken at this Time, when endeavours have been used, not only to forestal the Freedom of Elections, but even the Freedom of Voting in the Parliament-House: and when the Counties of <hi>England</hi> have been practised upon, to be made Repeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, both within doors and without: They have been Catechised, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if they were Parliament-Men, they would Repeal the <hi>Penal Laws</hi> and <hi>Tests</hi>; or, if they were not Chosen themselves, whether they would Chuse such as would. And as for the Boroughs, they have been all of them Sifted to the very Bran: nay, some Persons have been wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to enter into Engagements before-hand, in their <hi>Addresses:</hi> But, I suppose, those that have been so very forward to promise themselves to serve a Turn, will never be thought worthy to serve in <hi>Parliament.</hi> And at the same time others have made it their business, to render these <hi>Laws</hi> very odious to the People, and to hoot them out of the World; they have been Arraign'd and Condemn'd as <hi>Draconicks,</hi> as <hi>Bloudy and Canibal Laws,</hi> as <hi>Vngodly Laws,</hi> and contrary to the Divine Principle of <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of CONSCIENCE,</hi> without the common Justice of ever being Heard: For the Preambles of these <hi>Laws,</hi> which shew the Justice and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of them, and the reasonableness both of their Birth and Continuance, have been industriously suppressed. This indeed has been a very bold Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, for I am apt to think there is much truth in my Lord Chief Justice <hi>Coke</hi>'s Observation, <hi>That never any Subject Wrestled a Fall with the Laws of</hi> England, <hi>but they always broke his Neck:</hi> And therefore, according to the Courtesie of <hi>England,</hi> I shall wish Friend <hi>William Pen,</hi> and his Fellow-Gamesters, a good Deliverance. But while they have taken the liberty
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:63608:2"/>
to say their Pleasure of these <hi>Laws,</hi> which are now in as full Force as the day they were made, I shall take leave, according to the Duty of a Loyal Subject, (with whom the <hi>Laws</hi> of the Land are a Principle, and who must always own the Majesty and Authority of them, till such time as they are lawfully Repealed) to offer a few words in their behalf, which shall be dictated by nothing but Law, Truth, and Justice; and if every word that I say, do not appear to be such, I am content to have this whole Paper go for nothing, and be as if it had never been written.</p>
            <p>And to proceed the more clearly and distinctly, I shall (1st) consider the <hi>Penal Laws</hi> (as they are called) against the Papists, and the two <hi>Tests:</hi> And (2dly) the <hi>Penal Laws</hi> against the Dissenters.</p>
            <p>In the Statute 3<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 
               <hi>Iacobi</hi> c. 1. which is read every Fifth of <hi>November,</hi> in our Churches, the <hi>Laws</hi> made against the Papists in Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>'s time, and the Confirmation of them 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 
               <hi>Iacobi</hi> (against which the great Out-cry is now made, and for the sake of which, they then attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted to <hi>blow up</hi> both the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament</hi>) are called <hi>Necessary and Religious Laws:</hi> And if I prove them to be undoubtedly such, I hope the good People of <hi>England</hi> will look upon them an hundred times, before they part with them once.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> The <hi>Laws</hi> against the Papists are <hi>Religious Laws</hi>; they are <hi>Laws</hi> made for the high Honour of GOD, as well as for the common Profit of the Realm, which is the old Title of all our <hi>Laws,</hi> and is the right End to which all <hi>Laws</hi> ought to be directed. But why are they called <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> for have not all <hi>Laws</hi> a Penalty annexed to them? Perhaps they mean, that these are <hi>Laws</hi> which interpose in Matters indifferent, such as is the eating of Flesh on <hi>Fridays.</hi> But is not Popery <hi>Malum in se?</hi> Is Idolatry an Evil only by chance, and by happening to be prohibited? Is not the Worship of a Wafer God, an Onion God, or a Red-cloth God, an unspeakable Dishonour to the GOD of Heaven, in all places, in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry season of the Year, every day of the Week, and all hours of the Day? Is it not eternally Evil? The <hi>Laws</hi> of the Land found Idolatry prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to their hands, by the written Law of GOD, and even antecedent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to that, it was prohibited by the Law of Nature; and no Municipal <hi>Laws</hi> in the World need desire a better Warrant: And therefore to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal the <hi>Laws</hi> made against the <hi>Idol of the Mass, Agnus Dei's, Blocks Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,</hi> and the infinite Idolatry which is interwoven with <hi>Popery,</hi> is neither more nor less, than to undertake to Repeal the Laws of GOD.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly, The <hi>Laws</hi> made against the Seminary Priests and Romish Missi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners, are <hi>Religious Laws,</hi> because they are made in pursuance of St. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Precept, 2 Epist. 10. 11. <hi>If there come any unto you, and bring not this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God-speed: For he that biddeth him God-speed, is partaker of his evil deeds.</hi> But do the Seminaries
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:63608:2"/>
come and bring us the true Doctrine of Christ? Do they not bring us ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Gospel? As Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> has Unanswerably proved upon them, in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Part of his <hi>Preservative against POPERY.</hi> And therefore as every pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate man is bound to shut his Doors against these Deceivers and Seducers, by the same reason every Community is bound to expel and drive them out of the Nation. And I think there never were such errant Cheats and Impostors as these are: for they, by their Masses, can fetch Souls out of Purgatory, of their own putting in; they can forgive Sins, in the Sacrament of Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; they can drive away the Devil, with Crosses and Holy Water; and they can make their God, in the Sacrament. They make a God! they make a Pudding!</p>
            <p>Again, 2ly, The <hi>Laws</hi> against the Papists, are called <hi>Necessary Laws,</hi> and so they were to the very Being of the Kingdom. In the first of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the Oath of Supremacy was absolutely necessary to throw off the Romish Yoke, and that intollerable Usurpation and Tyranny of the Pope, under which both the Crown and Kingdom were perfect Slaves: And af<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>wards, was it not time to look after the Pope's Chaplains, when they had raised a Rebellion in the <hi>North,</hi> and he himself had sent a Bull to Depose the Queen, and to Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve her Subjects from their Allegiance? I do not mention the continual Minings of the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> in which the Popish Party always joyned with her, and besides, had drawn in several deluded Protestants; which made a great Jest to the Papists, That Protestants should be so infatuated, as to assist the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> to their own Destruction: as is to be seen in Sir <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Walsingham</hi>'s Letter, written from <hi>Paris,</hi> still extant in the <hi>Cabala of Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi> In short, it appears by the Preambles of all those Statutes in that Reign, that the Kingdom made every one of them in their own Defence, and to Preserve themselves from Popish Attempts, and that the Nation had utterly perished without them.</p>
            <p>And then in Kings <hi>Iames</hi>'s time, Did not the Papists <hi>digg</hi> under the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Pillars of the Kingdom, and make them <hi>shake,</hi> when they laid so many <hi>Barrels of Gunpowder</hi> under the Parliament-House? And was it not high time to tye their hands by the Acts which followed; by more close<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confining them to their Houses, by banishing them ten Miles from <hi>London,</hi> by disabling them not only from all Offices, but from being in any publick Employment, and by thorowly disarming them, so much as from wearing a Sword.</p>
            <p>And was it not time, in the late King's Reign, to put new life into the Disabling Acts, by the addition of a <hi>Test,</hi> when several Papists had gotten the greatest Offices of the Kingdom into their hands? And then as for the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament-Test,</hi> that the Papists may not be our Law-givers, besides the perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Necessity of such a <hi>Law,</hi> the Occasion of it is still upon Record both in Mens Minds, and very largely in the <hi>Iournal</hi> of the House of Lords, and in other inferiour Courts of Record.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:63608:3"/>And if these were all of them <hi>Necessary Laws</hi> when they were made, they are become ten times more <hi>Necessary</hi> since: for now Popery has Beset us, and and Hemmed us in on every side. We have an Army of Priests and Jesuites, the true Fore-runners of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> in the Bowels of the Kingdom; nay, the Pope himself, who by several <hi>Laws</hi> is declared to be the publick Enemy of the Kingdom, has arrived some time since in his <hi>Nuncio,</hi> and is now Compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Land in his <hi>Four Apostolick Uicars.</hi> And therefore to talk of Repealing <hi>Laws,</hi> when we want the strictest Execution of them, is talk only fit for <hi>Bedlam:</hi> and that Nation which Repeals <hi>Necessary Laws,</hi> when it has the greatest <hi>Necessity</hi> for them, must be concluded to be weary of its own Life, and is <hi>Felo de se!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I come now to the <hi>Penal Laws</hi> against the Dissenters, concerning which, I shall say the less, because GOD's time for the Repealing of those <hi>Laws</hi> is not yet come; For if they cannot be Repealed in this juncture of time, unless the Dissenters put forth their hands to the setting up of <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,</hi> then they cannot be Repealed: and therefore what cannot be now done without manifest Impiety, must even be let alone till it can be done with a good Conscience. As for the good Disposition which is in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists, to Repeal those <hi>Laws,</hi> with the first Opportunity, that is always to be measured by Actions rather than Words, and therefore I shall give them an Instance of it in the Bill for Repealing the 25th of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> which pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed both Houses, of <hi>a Church of England Parliament,</hi> thô the Dissenters lost the Benefit of that Pledge, and Earnest of their Good will, and are not Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant which way it was lost. But in the mean time, if our Dissenting Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren should endeavour to get these <hi>Laws</hi> Repealed, by parting on their side with the <hi>Laws</hi> against Popery, then I begg of them to minde the plain <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> of such Conditions. It is as if the Dissenters should say <hi>thus</hi> to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist: Do you help us to set up <hi>Meeting-Houses,</hi> and we will do as much for your <hi>Mass-Houses:</hi> let but the pure Worship of GOD be established with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Ceremonies, and we are content, that Idolatry itself shall go share and share like, in the same Establishment: to make a <hi>Magna Charta</hi> which shall be equal, let CHRIST have his part in it, and <hi>Antichrist</hi> shall be sure to have his: our business is to receive the Sacrament without Kneeling; and upon that Condition, we will joyn in the making of <hi>Laws,</hi> which shall Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize the Deifying a bit of Bread, the Worshipping of it for a God, the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it, Idolatry, Blasphemy, any thing in the World for them that like it.</p>
            <p>Now is not this a very fair Speech, and does it not well become the mouths of Protestants! I would fain press this home upon the Consciences, both of those Dissenters who are hired, and of those who are not hired, to labour the Repeal of our <hi>Laws:</hi> Do you fear the Informers more than GOD? Will you, for the sake of your little Conveniencies, do the greatest Evils, which you know to be such? You know in your very Hearts, that the Worship of Images, Crosses, and of a Wafer, is abominable Idolatry; that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:63608:3"/>
the half Communion is Sacriledge; and that many other Points of <hi>Popery</hi> are <hi>Blasphemous Fables:</hi> And will you set up <hi>this</hi> for one of your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions, as by <hi>Law</hi> established? Will you do all that hands can do, to entail <hi>Idolatry</hi> upon the Nation, not only <hi>Removendo prohibens,</hi> as Divines destin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish, by pulling down the <hi>Laws</hi> which hinder it, but also <hi>Promovendo adju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vans,</hi> and by making a perpetual <hi>Magna Charta</hi> for it? The <hi>Laws</hi> and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of a Country do denominate that Country; if <hi>Atheism</hi> were here Authorized by <hi>Law,</hi> this would be an Atheistical Nation; and if <hi>Idolatry</hi> be set up by <hi>Law,</hi> it is an Idolatrous Nation; and all that have any hand in it, make it the Sin of the Nation, as well as their own. Think therefore of these things in time, before you have involved both yourselves and your Country in a miserable Estate; and remember poor <hi>Francis Spira</hi> who went against <hi>Light.</hi>

            <p>But, 2ly, there is just as much Prudence as Conscience in these Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; For by Repealing the <hi>Laws</hi> against <hi>Popery,</hi> you Reverse the Outlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and take off those legal Disabilities which the Papists now lie under, and which have hitherto tied their hands from Destroying Hereticks. When Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists shall be Right Justices and Sheriffs, and not Counterfeits, when they shall be <hi>Probi &amp; legales homines,</hi> and pass Muster in <hi>Law,</hi> when they shall be both our Legal Judges and our Lawful Juries, and when Protestants come to be Tryed by their Country, that is to say, by their <hi>Twelve Popish Godfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> they may easily know what sort of Blessing they are to expect. The Papists want nothing but these Advantages, to make a fair riddance of all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants; for we see by several of their late Pamphlets, that if any thing be said against Popery, they have a great dexterity in laying it Treason. Now this is a civil way of Answering Arguments, for which we are bound to thank them, because it so plainly discovers what they would be at, if it were in their Power. But how comes it to be Treason to speak against a Religion which is itself High Treason, and is Proscribed by so many <hi>Laws?</hi> Why, their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium is this, That Popery is the King's Religion, and therefore, by an <hi>Innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endo,</hi> what is said against that, is meant against him. But is there any <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> that Popery shall be the King's Religion? Or is it Declared by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Law,</hi> that Popery either is, or can be his Religion? On the other hand, we are enabled by an Act in this very Reign, to Pronounce Popery to be a False Religion, and to Assert the Religion which is now Professed in the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and Established by the <hi>Laws</hi> of this Realm, to be the <hi>True Christian Religion.</hi> Act for Building St. <hi>Anne</hi>'s Church, <hi>p.</hi> 133. But these Gentlemen it seems are for Hanging men without <hi>Law,</hi> or against <hi>Law,</hi> or any how; and therefore we thank them again, for being thus plain with us before-hand. Now if they be thus Insolent, when they are so very Obnoxious themselves, and have Halters about their own Necks, with what a Rod of Iron will they Rule us, when they are our <hi>Masters!</hi> What havock will they then make of the Nation, when we already see <hi>Magdalen-Colledge,</hi> which was lately <hi>a Flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing Society of Protestants,</hi> now made <hi>a Den of Iesuites</hi>; and that done
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:63608:4"/>
too in such a way, as shakes all the <hi>PROPERTY</hi> in <hi>England?</hi> Or who can be safe, after our <hi>Laws</hi> are Repealed, when Endeavours have been lately used, to extract Sedition even out of Prayers and Tears, and the <hi>Bishops Humble Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition</hi> was threatned to be made a <hi>Treasonable Libel?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But here the Dissenters have a plausible Excuse for themselves: For say they, We have now an opportunity of getting the <hi>Laws</hi> which are against us Repealed, which is clear Gain; and as for our refusing to Repeal the <hi>Laws</hi> against Popery, there is nothing gotten by that, either to us or to any body else; for they are already as good as Repealed by the <hi>Dispensing Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:</hi> and therefore such Discourse as this, only advises us to stand in our own light, without doing any good to the Nation at all; for there will be Popish Justices, Sheriffs, Judges, and Juries, whether we will or no, for whatsoever we refuse to do, the <hi>Dispensing Power</hi> will supply.</p>
            <p>To which I Answer, Do you keep your hands off from Repealing the <hi>Laws,</hi> let who will Contravene or Transgress them, for then you are free from the Bloud of all Men; you have no share in the Guilt of those Mischiefs which befal your Country, which would, sooner or later, be a heavy Burden, and a dead Weight upon the Conscience of any Protestant. But besides, let the <hi>Laws</hi> alone, and they will defend both themselves and us too: For if the <hi>Law</hi> says, That a Papist shall not, nor cannot have an Office, then he shall not nor cannot; For who can speak Louder than the <hi>LAWS!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for a <hi>Dispensing Power,</hi> inherent in the King, which can set aside as many of the <hi>Laws</hi> of the Land as he pleases, and Suspend the Force and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of them, (which has been lately held forth by many False and Unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Pamphlets) the Dissenters know very well that there is no such thing; but that no body may pretend Ignorance, I shall here prove, in very few words, That by the Established <hi>Laws</hi> of the Land, the King <hi>cannot</hi> have such a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensing Power</hi>; unless Dispensing with the <hi>Laws,</hi> and Executing the <hi>Laws</hi> be the same thing; and unless both keeping the <hi>Laws</hi> himself, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing them to be kept by all others, be the <hi>English</hi> of Dispensing with them: For in the Statute of <hi>Provisors,</hi> 25th <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 25. we have this laid down for <hi>Law,</hi> That the King is bound to Execute those Statutes which are Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repealed, and to cause them to be kept as the <hi>Law</hi> of the Realm: the words are these, speaking of a Statute made in the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the First, <hi>Which Statute holdeth always his Force, and was never Defeated or Annulled in any point, And by somuch our Soveraign Lord the King is bound by his Oath to do, the same to be kept as the Law of this Realm, although by Sufferance and Negligence it hath since been attempted to the contrary.</hi> So that the <hi>Coronation Oath,</hi> and the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensing Power,</hi> are here by King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, and his <hi>Parliament,</hi> Declared to be utterly Inconsistent. Now the <hi>Coronation Oath</hi> is a Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental <hi>Law</hi> of this Kingdom, for it is antecedent to the <hi>Oath of Allegiance.</hi> Accordingly if you look upon the <hi>Coronation Oath</hi> in the <hi>Parliament</hi> Rowl, 1st <hi>Hen.</hi> 4th, you shall there find, that in the third Branch of it, the King Grants
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:63608:4"/>
and Promises upon his Oath, <hi>That the Laws shall be Kept and Protected by him,</hi> secundum Vires suas, <hi>to the utmost of his Power</hi>; and therefore he has no Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er left him to Dispense withal.</p>
            <p>By which it appears, that those men are the wretched Enemies both of the King and Kingdom, who would fain perswade the King that he has this <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensing Power</hi>; because therein they endeavour to perswade him, that <hi>Perjury</hi> is his Prerogative. Heretofore, in <hi>Tresilian</hi>'s time,<note place="margin">11. R. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.</note> some of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of the <hi>Law</hi> were consulted, Whether it could stand with the <hi>Law</hi> of the Kingdom, that the King might Obviate and Withstand the Ordinances concerning the King and the Kingdom, which were made in the last <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> by the Peers and Commons of the Realm, with the King's Assent, though (as the Courtiers said) forced in that behalf? And they made Answer, That the King might Annul such Ordinances, and Change them at his pleasure, into a better fashion, because he was above the Laws, <hi>Knyghton Col.</hi> 2693. Now this was very False <hi>Law,</hi> as those Judges found afterwards to their Cost; and it was grounded on the worst Reason that could be: For they must needs know from all their Books, and from the <hi>Mirror</hi> in particular, <hi>p.</hi> 282. <hi>That the first and Soveraign Abusion of the Law</hi> (that is, the chief Contrariety and Repugnancy to it) <hi>is for the King to be above the Law, whereas he ought to be Subject to it, as is contained in his Oath.</hi> Neither could they be ignorant of that Argument which the Peers used, to shew the Absurdity of such a sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position; it is Recorded in the Annals of <hi>Barton,</hi> set forth, as I take it, by Mr. <hi>Obadiah Walker. Si Rex est supra Legem, tunc est extra Legem; Num Rex Angliae est Exlex?</hi> If the King be above the <hi>Law,</hi> then he is without the <hi>Law.</hi> What! is the King of <hi>England</hi> an Outlaw? And as for the words of <hi>Bracton,</hi> they were too plain either to need a Comment or Translation, <hi>Rex habet Superiorem Deum, item Legem per quam factus est Rex, item Curiam suam, scil. Comites &amp; Barones.</hi> As likewise those other words of his, <hi>Ubi Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas Imperat &amp; non Lex, ibi non est Rex:</hi> Where he makes it the very Essence of our King, to Govern according to <hi>Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having therefore shewn, that the <hi>Laws</hi> are always in full Force till they are Revoked by the same Authority which made them, and that all Persons whatsoever are bound to the <hi>Laws,</hi> and that the <hi>Laws</hi> themselves were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in Bondage to any Man; we know from thence, what we are to conclude, concerning those Papists, who pretend to be in <hi>Office,</hi> in Defiance to the <hi>Laws.</hi> We had once a mischievous Distinction of Sheriffs <hi>de Iure,</hi> and Sheriffs <hi>de Facto</hi>; but those, who pretend to be in Office without taking the <hi>TEST,</hi> are no Officers either in <hi>Right</hi> or in <hi>Fact:</hi> for the 25 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. says, That their Offices are <hi>ipso facto,</hi> void, and then those Officers are <hi>ipso facto,</hi> no Officers, and can do us no more hurt than if they were under Ground; and therefore we need not trouble our Heads about them, though they may in all likelihood fall under the Care and Consideration of a <hi>Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:63608:5"/>After all, some persons may possibly be so far deluded, as to think there is somewhat of Equity in the Toleration of Papists, and that it is the Christian Rule <hi>Of doing as one would be done by.</hi> Now for any Papist to plead this Rule of Equity himself, or any body else in his behalf, is just as if a High-way-man should thus urge it upon his Judge; My Lord, if you Hang me, you break the Golden Rule; for I am sure you are not willing to be so served yourself, nor to Hang with me. Now the Equity of the Judge in this case does not lye, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in forbearing to punish the Offender, or in Hanging with him for Company, but in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Content to submit to the same Law, if he himself should commit the same Crime And so are we willing to lye under all the Penal Laws, whenever we turn Papists: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no body can tax us with want of Equity; because we do no otherways to the Papists, than we are willing to be done by, in the same case. But it may be said, that our Conscience does not serve us to be Papists, though theirs does. Neither does the Judge's Conscience serve him to Rob, though it seems the High-way-man's did; and therefore take heed of Liberty of Conscience. Still it may be further Replied, That this is properly a Judicial Cau<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>, because Robbery is a breach of the Peace and of Property, and therefore ought to b<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> it be amiss, yet it ought not to be punished by <hi>Humane Laws,</hi> but is to be reserved to the <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="5 letters">

               </gap>ment of God alone, who is Lord of Conscience.</p>
            <p>Now this is the New Doctrine which I shall prove to be False, by positive and ex<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ss Scripture. For <hi>Iob</hi> says, <hi>Chap.</hi> 31. <hi>v.</hi> 28. That if his Heart had been secretly perswaded, and he had thereupon kissed his Hand to the Sun or Moon, <hi>This were an iniquity to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished by the Iudge,</hi> because he had therein Lyed against the God above. So that though a Mans Heart and Conscience lead him to Idolatry, yet <hi>Iob</hi> tells us, this is Inditable; it is <hi>avon pelili,</hi> a Judicial Crime, and as Punishable by Human Laws, as Adultery with another Mans Wife is; as you have it in the same Phrase in the 11th verse of the same Chapter.</p>
            <p>The second Instance of a <hi>Punishable Conscience</hi> in the Service of God, is that which our Saviour gives us, 16 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. <hi>Yea the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you, will think he doth God Service.</hi> Now I would fain <gap reason="illegible: over-inked" extent="1 word">

               </gap> whether such a Conscience as this ought not to be Restrained and Punished: And whether it be Sacriledge for Human Laws to Controle Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, I mean such a one <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">

And whether a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Prince has not been highly Extolled, and had all his most Christian Titles double Gilt, with the Flatteries of his Clergy, for the late Merit of his Religious Service in this kind? And therefore if men will do things in order, let them first send for a breed of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish Wolves, and give them English Liberties; let them dig down their Walls, and let in the Sea; let them begin with some of these Preliminaries, before they think of Repealing the Laws against Popery, and of letting loose such Consciences as these upon us.</p>
            <p>To conclude therefore, It highly concerns you, in the Choice of Parliament-men, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline all those men, who are willing to Consent to so Great and so Fatal a Revolution, as the Repeal of so many Laws at once; which would plainly expose the Protestant Religion to be Swallowed up. You want men like their Ancestors, who had the Courage and Resolution to declare in Parliament, <hi>Nolumus Leges Angliae mutari</hi>; We will not have the Laws of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> Altered. Chuse such as will not betray the Great Trust you repose in them. The Writ for Elections says, That you Impower your Representatives; Tell them therefore for what you Impower them; for the Maintenance and Preservation of the Protestant Religion, and of our good Laws, and not for their Destruction. And when you have done this, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken all the care you can, you have done your Duties: And I have nothing more to add, but, <hi>God Speed your Elections.</hi>
