            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>'TIs an approv'd Opinion, There's not so Vnhappy a Creature in the World, as the Man that wants Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for certainly he lives to very little use that only toyles in the same round, and because he knowes where he is, though in a dirty road, dares not venture on a smoother path for fear of being lost. That I am not the Wretch I Condemn, Your Royal Highness may be sufficiently Convinc't, in that I durst presume to put this Poem under your Patronage. My Motives to it were not Ordinary; for besides my own propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity to take any opportunity of publishing, the Extream De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion I owe Your Royal Highness; The mighty Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I receiv'd from your Approbation of it when presented on the Stage, was hint enough to let me know at whose Feet it ought to be laid. Yet whilst I do this, I am sensible the Curious World will expect some Panagerick on those Heroick Virtues which are throughout it so much Admir'd: But as they are a Theam too great for my Vndertaking, so only to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour at the truth of e'm, must in the distance between my obscurity and their height savour of a flattery, which in your Royal Highnesses esteem I would not be thought guilty of: though in that part of e'm which relates to my self, (<hi>viz.</hi> Your Favours showr'd on a thing so mean as I am) I know not how to be silent: For you were not only so indulgent to bestow
<pb facs="tcp:59664:3"/>
Your Praises on this, but ev'n (beyond my hopes) to declare in favour of my first Essay of this nature, and add yet the encouragement of your Commands to go forward, when I had the Honour to kiss Your Royal Highnesses hand in token of your permission to make a Dedication to You of the second. I must confess and boast I am very proud of it; and it were enough to make me more, were I not sensible how far I am Vndeserving. Yet when I consider You never give Your Favours precipitately, but that it is a Certain sign of some Desert when You vouchsafe to promote: I who have termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated my best hopes in it, should do wrong to Your Goodness, should I not let the World know my Mind, as well as my Condition is rais'd by it: I am certain none that know Your Royal Highness will disapprove my aspiring to the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of so Great and so Good a Master; One who (as is apparent by all those who have the Honour to be near You, and know you by that Title) never rais'd without Merit, or discountenanc't without Iustice; 'Tis that indeed obliging Severity which has in all men created an awful Love and Respect towards You, since in the firmness of your Resolution the brave and good man is sure of You, whilst the ill-minded and malignant fears you. This I could not pass over, and I hope Your Royal Highness will pardon it, since 'tis unaffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctedly my Zeal to You, who am in nothing so Vnfortunate, as that I have not a better opportunity to let You and the World know how much I am</p>

            <p>'TIs not that I have any great affection to scribling that I pester thee with a <hi>Preface,</hi> for amongst friends 'tis almost as poor a Trade with Poets, as it is with those tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<q>
                  <l>I pitty those who in these latter days</l>
                  <l>Do Write, when bounty hath shut up her Gate;</l>
                  <l>Where day and night in vain good Writers knock,</l>
                  <l>And for their labours oft have but a mock.</l>

            </p>
            <p>Thus I find it according to Sir <hi>Iohn Harington</hi>'s Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; had I understood <hi>Italian,</hi> I would have given it thee in the Original; but that is not my Talent, therefore to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed: This Play was the second that ever I writ or thought of writing: I must confess I had often a Tittillation to Poetry, but never durst venture on my Muse, till I got her into a Corner in the Country, and then like a bashful young Lover when I had her private I had Courage to fumble, but never thought she would have produc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This I publish to Antedate the objections some people may make against that Play who have been (and much good may it do 'em) very severe as they think upon this, whoever they are, I am sure I never disoblig'd them, nor have they (thanks my good fortune) much Injur'd me, in the mean while I forgive 'em, and since I am out of the reach on't, leave 'em to chew the Cud on their own Venom; I am

well satisfi'd I had the greatest party of men of wit and sence on my side, amongst which I can never enough acknowledge the unspeakable Obligations I received from the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>R.</hi> who far above what I am ever able to deserve from him, seem'd almost to make it his business to establish it in the good opinion of the <hi>King,</hi> and his <hi>Royal Highness,</hi> from both of which I have since received Confirmations of their good li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of it, and Encouragement to proceed; and it is to him I must in all gratitude confess I owe the greatest part of my good success in this, and on whose Indulgency I extreamly build my hopes of a next. I dare not presume to take to my self what a great many, and those I am sure of good Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment too, have been so kind to afford me <hi>(viz.)</hi> That it is the best Heroick Play that has been written of late; for I thank Heaven I am not yet so vain, but this I may modestly boast of, which the Author of the <hi>French Bernice</hi> has done before me in his Preface to that Play, that it never fail'd to draw Tears from the Eyes of the Auditors, I mean those whose Souls were capable of so Noble a pleasure, for 'twas not my business to take such as only come to a Play-house to see Farce-fools, and laugh at their own deformed Pictures: Though a certain Writer that shall be nameless (but you may guess at him by what follows) being ask't his opinion of this Play, very gravely Cock't, and cry'd, <hi>Igad he knew not a line in it he would be Author of</hi>; but he is a fine Facetious wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Person, as my friend Sir <hi>Formal</hi> has it; and to be even with him I know a Comedy of his, that has not so much as a Quibble in it which I would be Author of; and so Reader I bid him and thee</p>

            <head>The Prologue.</head>
            <l>WHen first our Authour took this Play in hand,</l>
            <l>He doubted much and long was at a stand.</l>
            <l>He knew the Fame and Memory of Kings</l>
            <l>Were to be treated of as Sacred things.</l>
            <l>Not as th'are represented in this Age,</l>
            <l>Where they appear the Lumber of the Stage;</l>
            <l>Us'd only just for reconciling Tools,</l>
            <l>Or what is worse, made Villains all, or Fools.</l>
            <l>Besides, the Characters he shows to Night,</l>
            <l>He found were very difficult to Write:</l>
            <l>He found the Fame of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> at stake,</l>
            <l>Therefore long paus'd and fear'd which part to take;</l>
            <l>Till this his judgment safest understood,</l>
            <l>To make'em both Heroick as he cou'd.</l>
            <l>But now the greatest stop was yet unpass't,</l>
            <l>He found himself, Alas! confin'd too fast.</l>
            <l>He is a man of Pleasures, Sirs, like you,</l>
            <l>And therefore hardly could to bus'ness bow,</l>
            <l>Till at the last he did this Conquest get,</l>
            <l>To make his pleasure whetstone to his wit,</l>
            <l>So sometimes for variety he writ.</l>
            <l>But as those Block-heads who discourse by Rote,</l>
            <l>Sometimes speak sence although they rarely know't.</l>
            <l>So he scarce knew to what his work would grow;</l>
            <l>But 'twas a Play because it would be so:</l>
            <l>Yet well he knows this is a weak pretence,</l>
            <l>For Idleness is the worst want of sence.</l>
            <l>Let him not now of carelessness be Taxt,</l>
            <l>He'l write in earnest when he writes the next;</l>
            <l>Mean while—</l>
            <l>Prune his superfluous Branches, never spare;</l>
            <l>Yet do it kindly, be not too severe,</l>
            <l>He may bear better fruit another year.</l>
