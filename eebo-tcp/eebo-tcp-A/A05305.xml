            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <g ref="char:leaf">❧</g> A Defence of Paul Baſſano the ſuruiuing Patentee, for the Importation of Freſh Salmons and Lobſters, &amp;c. by a new Inuention, which hee moſt humbly ſubmitteth to this Honorable houſe of Parliament.</head>
            <p n="1">
               <note place="margin">That the Inuention is New.</note>1. IT is a new Inuention amongſt the Engliſh heere, to bring Lobſters aliue in Ships by Sea from forraigne Seas, and ſtreames; although the Dutchmen who are Forrainers can doe the ſame. And howſoeuer he a little before the Patent did ſell ſome Lobſters to the Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers here, yet did not they know the ſecret of his Inuentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> how they were taken, how preſerued &amp; fed, and the Art how they were brought; for euery Wel-Boate will not bring them, nor is there yet any Shipwright in England that knowes how to make a Well for that purpoſe without particuler inſtruction. Nor did euer the Fiſhmongers, or any other before the Patent, bring any Lobſters by this or any other Inuention aliue, by Sea from any forraine parts. So there is no queſtion of the newneſſe of the Inuention: but whether it be the only Inuention of the Patentees, or of the Stranger. And who ought in our Common-weale to bee preferred, they or wee. But the now op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers did neuer buy of the Stranger, nor bring any Lobſters by Sea, by this or any other Inuention, before the Patent.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <note place="margin">The benefit therof to the Common-wealth.</note>2. That the Flemming was the firſt Inuentor of bringing Lobſters aliue by Sea wee deny not: but that hee was the Inuentor of thoſe thinges for our good wee deny. And contrariwiſe affirme, that by the Authority of this Patent, wee haue turned this Inuention which they deuiſed for their good, to the good of our Common-wealth. For when the Patentees vpon their owne aduenture had imployed Ships to Sea, and from remote Coaſts had brought Lobſters by Engliſh-men to London, by the ſecret of this new Inuention: 1. Then did they inuent how to preuent the extreame exaction wherewith the Dutch-men circumuented and brought the Engliſh into thraldome. 2. How alſo to preuent and ſuppreſſe the exaction, which thoſe few Fiſhmongers (who bought the Commodity of the Dutch) did make vpon the Company of Fiſhmongers, and ſo conſequently vpon the Subiect. 3. How to make the Dutchman a Seruant, who before was a Maſter, and to keepe him within the compaſſe of reaſonable gaine, that our Nation might haue the better penyworth. 4. How to haue the commodity ſolde Cheaper, without any exaction vpon aduantage of ſcarcity. 5. How to bring them more certainly then they were before. 6. In more continued Plenty. 7. And better conditioned, and preſerued in reputation good and Marchantable, which before was oftentimes bad and naught, euen to the loathing of the ſame, and the Subiect defrauded and couſened. 8. How the eater thereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes more content. 9. How to raiſe the little benefite that is gotten (in reſpect of the good which ariſeth) out of the Strangers purſe, not our Countrymens, and yet our Nation to reape a ſetled benefit hereby. 10. How to preſerue (at our charge) our Bullion and Coyne in our Kingdome, which was, and otherwiſe would bee ſubiect to bee embazeled by the Dutchman; Two or three thouſand pounds in a yeare, being disburſed to them for this commodity. 11. How to encreaſe our Nauigation and Nauigators, and to weede out the Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men by degrees, as by encouragement of gayne wee can ſtrengthen our owne Nation, (knowing the ſecret of this Inuention now as well as they) or at the leaſt to make the other our Seruant at a more reaſonable price, then wee can poſſibly effect the ſame. 12. Wherein none are reſtrained that had a benefit before. 13. The retayler hath more gayne, and the buyer better content. 14. Former partiality is auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and the commodity is diſtributed equally to the Company of Fiſhmongers, aſwell poore as rich. 15. The Patentees haue beene at more charges, for the good of the Common-weale to bring theſe thinges to paſſe, then yet they haue receiued. 16. And the oppoſers are few; but there is a generall aſſent that this Patent may ſtand.</p>
            <p>So as in concluſion, all things are carried in an euen ballance, whereby all parties receiue encouragement in their labours; and this Common-weale the benefit, ſince this Pattent was graunted, which by no other meanes can be effected. And this Pattent as it hath been gouerned, hath procured a commodity to this Common-weale and no diſcommodity; but if any be, it is to the Stranger whoſe exaction is preuented, and not to vs. And yet though he doth not attaine to the height of his expectation, he reſts contented, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath no better remedy, ſo long as this Pattent is in force, and dayly makes ſute to be imployed.</p>
            <p>And herein the Patentees doe not ſtand alone to iuſtifie themſelues, but the Maſter and Company of Fiſhmongers vſing the Trade, doe generally affirme and know the ſame: onely ſome few contradicters, who (wanting experience, or for other priuate reſpects) doe oppoſe the ſame. Neither can the oppoſers denie it, were they particularly examined and depoſed to the queſtions aboue-ſaid. This Pattent alſo vpon former oppoſition hath beene generally approued by the whole Company of Fiſhmongers. And confirmed by the Lords of the Counſaile, with this teſtimony by them added, that it deſerueth to be continued and countenanced by our State and Kingdome.</p>
            <p>And whereas it hath beene obiected that we would by vertue of this Patent, ſeaze vpon the Lobſters of any other of our Country-men that ſhould bring them from other parts, Our deſire is ſo much for the good of the Common-weale, to encourage our owne Nation, as we are ready and willing to giue free way (notwithſtanding the Pattent) to any of our Country-men that wil vndertake it and performe it accordingly, better then now it is. Onely we (for that purpoſe) will, as wee doe, by vertue of this Pattent keepe off the Stranger from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting vpon our Nation.</p>
            <p>And now we moſt humbly ſubmit it to your Honourable conſideration, who ſpeakes moſt for the good of the Common-weale, either the oppoſers, or the affirmers. And whether, this Pattent not being mannaged, (as ſome others haue bin) to the preiudice of any but to defend vs from the exaction of the Stranger, and for the generall good of all: and theſe particulars being proued, your graue iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhall hold the ſame worthy your fauours, and to be continued and countenanced for the good of the Common-weale. For they deſire not if it be not found good for the State and Kingdome, that it doe continue. Onely they humbly deſire it would pleaſe this Honourable houſe to call before you, or ſome Committee for that purpoſe, the Maſter and Company of Fiſhmongers vſing this Trade, and (if theſe reaſons ſeeme of any importance) to make tryall thereby of the truth of that which we haue affirmed.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Of these in order.</hi>
            </p>
            <div type="proofs">
               <pb facs="tcp:24837:2"/>
               <head>The Proofes.</head>
               <p n="1">1. THe exaction of the Dutch preuented. For whereas before the Patent, by degrees they raiſed the Lobſters 35. ſhillings in a hundreth, we haue brought them back 20. ſhillings in abatement of the price; and by degrees would haue brought them lower: for they would not ſtand to the caſualty of the Market when they came, but be ſure of their money before they went, howſoeuer the market fell out here.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The exaction of the Fiſhmongers vpon their Company auoyded. For whereas they who bought the Ships ladings of the Dutch in groſſe, did retayle them at 7.8. and 9. pound the hundreth; they are now neuer ſolde aboue 6. pound: and if they bee ſmall, they haue two or three hundred for one.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To make the Dutchman a Seruant. For now wee know the Inuention: if hee will not goe for reaſonable gayne, wee can ſet others on worke, and none can draw him from vs by proffer of greater gayne.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The commodity better Cheape. For the Fiſhmongers buy them at 6. pound the hundreth, whereas before they haue beene ſolde for 9. pound: and this is cauſed alſo by the dayly comming of them, and the orderly vſage thereof, as the Fiſhmongers themſelues will iuſtifie.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It comes more certaine. Becauſe wee make the Dutch all become partners, though wee doe employ 20. Ships, for none may goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore or behinde another, but 19. of them ſhall helpe to lade and furniſh away the 20.th: So as by that meanes wee haue euery day a Ship ready to come away, if the winde ſerue from that place, Whereas otherwiſe if euery man ſhould lade himſelfe, they would be a Fortnight or three weekes before they could bee prouided of a fraight to defray their charges, And ſo ſometimes they would come altogether vpon a cluſter, and be ſpoyled before they could be vented, and ſome whiles none in a Fortnight or in a Month together, whereas now they are heere euery day during the Seaſon, the winde ſeruing.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The plenty is greater. For wee haue that dayly by this order, which before wee had but once in a Fortnight or in a Month: and then 4. Ships might happen to come together, and ſometimes but one, which confuſednes cauſed a ſcarcity afterwards.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Better conditioned. Which muſt needs follow, becauſe they now in two or three dayes lade a Ship, all helping together being part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and they are brought away more ſpeedily, which muſt needes come better, then when euery one lading for himſelfe, is two or three Weekes lading his Boate, by which meanes ſome are ſpoyled and dead whilſt the reſt are taking.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The eater is more content. Which followes by the former reaſons; for the Goodnes, certainty, and cheapnes being approued, he is encouraged to eate them.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The benefit is raiſed from the Stranger not our Subiects. For wee haue brought him downe from his former exaction, to a lower price, from whence ariſeth the profit that is made, and yet they are ſolde cheaper to the Fiſhmonger.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Our Coyne and Bullion is preſerued in our Kingdome. For wee hyre one of their owne Nation heere to giue them Bils of exchange to receiue their money in their owne Countrey out of his eſtate there, and ſo they receiue nothing from vs but Paper.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Nauigation is increaſed. Becauſe wee hauing learn'd the ſecret of this Inuention, haue imployed our owne Countrymen, and ſtill doe, in Ships bought by our ſelues, wherein wee haue loſt two Ships at Sea among the rockes in the Aduenture: and doe offer our Nation for their encouragement 10. ſhillings more in a hundreth, then the Strangers hath for Lobſters, and by degrees as we can increaſe our owne Nation, doe intend to weed out the Dutchmen. But all cannot be done vpon the ſodaine: for if wee barre the Dutchmen before we haue increaſed our owne Countrymen to ſerue the turne, then would theſe oppoſers complaine much more that the Market is not ſerued; and wee doe the rather a while forbeare, becauſe of the vncertainty of the Patent: for if we ſhould build 20. Ships our ſelues (as wee imploy no leſſe for this ſeruice) it would bee a great preiudice and loſſe to haue them lye vpon our hands. But wee will vndertake, if wee may haue the fauour of our State to our Patent, to weede out the Dutch quite within three or foure yeares, and to plant our owne Nation wholly in the Trade, as wee haue begun already, if it ſhall ſo ſeeme good to this Hon: Aſſembly.</p>
               <p>Neither is there any hope to encreaſe our Nauigation in this kinde, but by vertue of this Pattent. For otherwiſe were the Dutch-man at liberty, as he was before: hee would firſt weary our Nation in vnder-ſelling them, and when the Trade were come into his owne hands, exact vpon them infinitely by degrees at his pleaſure as he did before, which he will effect by theſe meanes. Firſt, he is more induſtrious, and liues more hardly then our men. And next. He can haue money in his Country at 4. or 5. pound in the hundreth: ſo as if he make but ten pound in the hundreth, he is a great gayner. Whereas with vs money is at ten pound, and we ſhall be looſers (regarding our hazard of Ships and Goods) if wee make not 15. pound in the hundreth. And thus will he vndermine vs, and then make his owne price as afore-ſaid.</p>
               <p n="12">12. None are reſtrayned that had any benefit before. Theſe fewe oppoſers neuer had any Trading as afore-ſaid. But for thoſe Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers who bought Lobſters of the Dutch-men, The Patentees were ſo ready to auoyde any cauſe of grieuance, as they did graunt the one halfe of the benefit of the ſaid Pattent to them, ſo as they reſt well contented, though it abridge them of their former gaine, becauſe of the good to the Common-weale, and that by experience they doe finde the confuſion that was before: the good Order that is now, and what thraldome they ſhould fall into hereafter, in reſpect of the enuie of ſome, if this Pattent were put downe, as alſo the Maſter and whole Company in generall will not denie.</p>
               <p n="13">13. The Retayler hath more gaine, becauſe that which was wont to come monethly, comes now dayly, and becauſe they are ſolde to him cheaper, and better as afore-ſaid: ſo the eater being encouraged to buy, they ſell the more, and neuer looſe by them, being now good, which they often did when they were bad.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Former partiality is auoyded: for whereas before the Fiſhmonger who bought a Ship of Lobſters of the Dutch, If there were profit to be gotten thereby, would ſell them to none but to his particular friends by hundreths, who traded with him for other Commodities, ſo as the poorer ſort could ſildome or neuer get any, but to their loſſe in a glutt. Now they are made out by leſſer parcels, equally, and ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed to poore as well as rich: They haue them without money, and pay not till they haue made their profit, and ſometimes neuer pay.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The other points, are ſufficiently explaned in the former diſcourſe, and therefore to auoyde prolixity omitted here.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ONely this we are bold to adde, that the Patentees haue alſo in this Graunt a Priuiledge, for bringing Salmons freſh and vnſalted by a new Inuention (wherein though they did not vndertake ſo much) yet haue they by their Inuention brought Salmons aliue from Scotland to England in the hotteſt and moſt vnſeaſonable times of the yeare: and for a ſample and teſtimony thereof, preſented one aliue to the Lord Mayor of London that then was: which neuer any Engliſh man or other did before. Yet ſeeing our Pattent hath beene dayly oppoſed by ſome vaine-glorious, or enuious ſpirits of the Fiſhmongers, and threatned to be throwne downe; we haue forborne to put the ſame in further practiſe, leaſt wee ſhould with the Bee, gather honey for Drones to ſucke, till wee ſee how this Kingdome will cheriſh our good endeauours for the Common-weale, as the Lords of the Counſell haue done already. For it ſtands with the pollicie of all States and Kingdomes, to ſupport and countenance new Inuentions with moſt fauourable conſtructions, when they tend and are imployed to the good of the weale publike, and to the hurt of none. As this Pattent is mannaged.</p>

And for any Engliſh man who can i<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Though the opinion of Maſter Atturney Generall that laſt was, certified to the Lords of the Counſell; is, That it is no Trade vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it were of ſeauen yeares continuance before the pattent.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Obiect.</hi> That two Fiſhmongers were impriſoned by the now Lord Chancellour for oppoſing the pattentees, and driuen from their Trade.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> Theſe men were no Traders with the Dutch, or otherwiſe venturers for Lobſters before the pattent: but ſetting themſelues againſt the pattent; they bought ſome Lobſters of the Dutch, who came ſtragling from their fellowes, with a polliticke purpoſe to breake the good order which was begun for the good of the Common-weale, and thereby to bring all to confuſion againe. A complaint being thereof made to the Lord Chancellour; vpon due conſideration of their bad in<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ention, and examination of the matter, (they being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractory and refuſing obedience to the pattent) his Lordſhip committed them, and vpon their ſubmiſſion releaſed them againe. And the moſt worthy of them was afterwards ſo farre reſpected by the Patentees, as he was accepted to be a partner with them to his good content. And that this was iuſt, and a fault in the oppoſers, appeares in this, for that vpon like complaint made to the Counſell Table, by the ſame men and others, their Lordſhips (notwithſtanding) confirmed the pattent againſt their oppoſition, ſeeing the ſame to be conuenient and good for the Common-weale.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Obiect.</hi> That the Dutchmen brought Lobſters in ſuch plenty before the Patent, as they ſolde them for 3. pound and 40. ſhillings the hundreth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> This is moſt falſe, for the Dutchmen would neuer goe but he would be ſure of his price before he came hither, which was 5. pound 15-ſhillings the hundreth: and if then when they were bad and naught, they were rarely ſolde at 3. pound, it was to the Fiſhmongers great loſſe, and diſcouragement to the eater for euer buying the commodity againe. But when they were good and ſcarcer, they were ſolde for 9. pound the hundreth to the Fiſhmonger, but much more to the Subiect, which was a great exaction: and now they are neuer ſolde aboue 6. pound, which is the loweſt price they were ſolde for at any time before, (vnleſſe it were to great loſſe) and they haue two or 3. hundreth for one if they bee ſmall. So as one hundreth at 6. pound, in ſuch manner deliuered good and ſweet, is better then a hundreth that are ſtarke naught at 5. pound, whereby the Subiect is but deceiued, and brought to a loathing of the commodity.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Obiect.</hi> There are many Lobſters now ſolde by the Fiſhmongers which are extreame bad and naught.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> It is very true; but theſe are ſuch dead Lobſters as are brought by Marriners from Newcaſtle, ready ſodden, which ſeldome or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer come good. But thoſe that come by this Inuention are deliuered ſweet and Marchantable.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Obiect.</hi> The Lobſters are kept at Quinborough, to the great loſſe of the Flemming and ſpoyle of the commodity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> This is a moſt falſe ſuggeſtion. For there is no compariſon of them that dye there and of thoſe that dyed heare before the Patent: for if at any time they ſtay there, they are kept for preſeruation in their owne element the Sea, and ſo fed. Whereas being taken out before they are ready to be ſpent, they are out of their element, and kept in Ware-houſes (which muſt needes be worſe) foure or 5. dayes together, where they pine away, dye, and corrupt infinitely to the deteſtation of the commodity: But from Quinborough they are brought aliue, and if any doe pine there, they are caſt away at the Strangers charge; the rather becauſe there ſhall be no ſcandall vpon the commodity, nor offence thereby to the eye, ſtomack, or purſe here. For we doe not ſuffer any that are bad to come hither. Nor is there any aduantage by vs made in this vpon the Subiect, for the price is neuer rayſed: ſo as the oppoſers haue rather cauſe to giue vs thanks for our care, then thus to requite vs with falſe aſperſions, if either they remembred what hath beene heretofore, or vnderſtood what would follow. But nothing will ſerue their turne but a diſſolution, though themſelues who are moſt forward to oppoſe (were the Pattent diſſolued) would ſooneſt finde and feele the ſmart.</p>
