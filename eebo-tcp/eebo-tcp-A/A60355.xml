            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <bibl>Psalm 116. 7.</bibl>
               <q>Return unto thy Rest, O my Soul! for the Lord hath dealt boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully with thee.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE words before us are part of a Psalm of Praise (in which we have reason to conclude <hi>David</hi>'s heart well tun'd, and wound up to an high pitch of Thankfulness) and therefore may by some be looked upon as somewhat improper for a Funeral Occasion and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity. But for the silencing and satisfaction of such as may so judge; I shall only say, this was the Scripture, upon which the heart of our deceased Friend and Brother was much set, and in the time of his health he did fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently mention it as the subject of that Sermon which should be Preached after his departure out of this World into an Eternal State; and if I am not greatly mistaken, it will freely and plentifully afford matter very fit for you to be entertained with at such a time as this: For though when a Child of God dieth, there is just cause of mourning among his Friends and dear Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and in the Church of God, of which he was a living Member, not upon his account, who is an unspeakable gainer, but their own, who are sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of a great loss, yet surely it ought to be such a mourning, as doth not exclude joy as a thing with which it is utterly inconsistent, because we are by the Word of Truth assured, that the day of such an ones death, is better than the day of his birth; and in the midst of those tears which are shed, there may be triumphs because of a blessed and glorious Victory that is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; and a desired compleat deliverance wrought from all those troubles and pressures which tried his Faith and Patience while a Pilgrim here; and likewise because then in a more special manner, after all his afflictive wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drings from Mountain to Hill, after all his sinful rambles and excursions, and after all his tedious travels, pursuits and runnings to and fro after Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-enjoyments and comforts, which did often run faster from him than he could after them, so that he was forced to lie down in sorrow upon the score of his disappointment; I say, after all this, his Soul doth at death take its flight for the other World, and joyfully returns unto that God with whom it long'd to be, and in whom it shall take up a perfect, undisturbed, and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Rest. There are but two things in the Text which need and call for Explication. <hi>Return unto thy rest, O my Soul!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Question will be, What are we here to understand by <hi>Rest?</hi> To which I answer in these three things briefly.</p>
            <p>First, Some do look upon it as importing a quiet state and condition, after all those tumblings &amp; tossings which he had had; the hurries of his life caused by the uncertainty and variety of Providences, the many and great afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that had been ordered out to him, God had now brought him <hi>ad lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:33976:5"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 line">
                  <desc>〈1 line〉</desc>
               </gap> and take possession. The Waters are asswaged, the Ark is upon firm ground, now, my Soul, go forth; and offer such a Sacrifice as will be of a sweet savour.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Others do by <hi>Rest</hi> understand a still and pacate frame; He had been before very uneasie, and thereupon unquiet in his Spirit. He had been under great and furious tempests, which had raised much filth and corruption that greatly royl'd him; while there were fightings without, there were fears within, and those fears did bid defiance to his Faith, &amp; in many Encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters prevailed against it, so that his Soul was dejected and disquieted within him: Now he would have those storms to be laid, and his Soul to return unto that blessed tranquillity and calm which in former times it did enjoy through the comfortable shinings of God upon it. But I shall pass by both these; therefore</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Others do here by <hi>Rest,</hi> understand <hi>God</hi> himself; so that when the Psalmist saith, <hi>Return unto thy Rest, O my Soul!</hi> his meaning is, <hi>Return unto thy God, redi ad illum, apud quem summam invenies tranquillitatem, nempe ad Deum,</hi> return to him, namely, to God, with whom thou wilt enjoy thy self as thou wouldest, in whom thou wilt have the greatest peace, and sweetest repose. Thou hast been going to this, and to the other, scattering thy ways; now, my Soul, give them their last farewel, and go to thy God, for with him it will be better with thee than it is now.</p>
            <p>As for that other phrase, <hi>the Lord hath dealt bountifully with thee;</hi> it is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously rendred. He hath <hi>recompensed</hi> thee, he hath given thee a <hi>reward;</hi> He hath <hi>done thee good; viz.</hi> in delivering thee from thine Enemies, from thy dangers, and from thy distresses, and from all thy fears. He hath <hi>satisfied</hi> thee by granting thy desires, and accomplishing thy hopes; but I see no just rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why we should leave our own Translation, <hi>the Lord hath dealt bountifully with thee.</hi> There is nothing else in the words that carrieth in it the least ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of a difficulty. In them we may take notice of these two parts.</p>
            <p>First, A gracious persons inviting or calling his Soul home; calling upon his Soul to leave its idle extravagancy, and to go back to the place from whence it came, to direct its steps or motions to that God with whom it should both be, and love to be. <hi>Return unto thy Rest, O my Soul!</hi> Return unto thy God, O my Soul!</p>
            <p>Secondly, Here is the Argument he useth for the prevailing with his Soul, and persuading it to steer this holy and blessed course; <hi>for the Lord hath dealt bountifully with thee;</hi> thy Experiences may very well be thy Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The Doctrines which I shall present you with from hence, are of the same number with the parts; unto both which I shall speak at this time</p>
            <p>First Doctrine is this; <hi>A gracious Soul should be glad to think of returning to its God, and often call upon it self to that purpose: Return unto thy Rest, O my Soul!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second Doctrine is this; <hi>The Experiences that gracious Souls have had of God; or, his former gracious and bountiful dealings with them, should be a covent and prevailing Argument for their returning unto him.</hi> This was
<pb facs="tcp:33976:5"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 line">
                  <desc>〈1 line〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>the Lord hath dealt bountifully with thee.</hi> We shall handle them in their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and so begin with the former.</p>
            <p>Doct. 1. <hi>A gracious Soul should be glad to think of returning to its God, and call often upon it self to such a blessed purpose. Return unto thy Rest, O my Soul!</hi> Now the very mentioning of a return to God, doth naturally and direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lead us to the consideration of a distance at which the Soul before was from God; for if there had not been a departure from God, there would not be any need of, nor occasion for a return to him, <hi>Ier.</hi> 3. 12. <hi>Return, thou backsliding</hi> Israel, <hi>saith the Lord.</hi> And again he calls, <hi>verse</hi> 22. <hi>Return, ye backsliding Children, and I will heal your backslidings.</hi> They had not walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with God, nor kept close to him, as they were by their duty and interest obliged to have done, but were gone from him: Though they had once come up to him, and went after him in a Wilderness, in a Land that was not sown, yet they drew back again; kindness would not hold them, nor Covenant, nor the Cords of a man, but back they did draw, yea and that not a little way, but as the Lord himself complained in <hi>Ier.</hi> 2. 5. <hi>They had gone far from him, and walked after vanity, and were become vain:</hi> But whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did they go, when they left God? you may be sure, they changed not for the better; they went to base Idols, to them that were not Gods, and that was a great way; they went far from God in going to Pagan Heathenish Idolatry, as those among us are gone far from God, who have renounced the Protestant Religion, and are gone over to the Tents of Antichrist, to Popish Idolatry. Yet for ever to be admired is the Divine mercy and goodness; those that had gone from God, yea that had gone so exceeding far from him without having any just cause given them for so doing, he was graciously pleased to call back again to himself, <hi>Return, O backsliding Children!</hi> so that a return doth speak a distance that is between God and man. Now this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance is to be found in a threefold state, and answerable to that threefold distance there is to be a threefold return; there is a distance from God at which man stands in a threefold state.

As God doth perfectly hate the carnal mans wickedness; so doth the carnal man hate Gods holiness, yea all holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, except it be an holy day of his own making. The unregenerate man cannot endure the splendor of the Sun, no, not so much as the twinkling of a Star: My meaning is, he cannot bear with the perfect holiness of God himself, no, not with the imperfect holiness of his People.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There is a distance from God in our <hi>imperfect state,</hi> while we are in our nonage and minority. The gracious Soul is indeed said to be brought nigh; as you may see in <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 13. <hi>Now in Christ Iesus ye Who were sometimes far off, are made nigh by the blood of Christ:</hi> So that as ye have it in <hi>verse</hi> 19. <hi>Ye are no more strangers and forreigners, but fellow-citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of the Saints, and of the houshold of God:</hi> You are now some of the family with some of the house; all those that are sincere Converts, sound Believers, persuaded to be not almost, but altogether Christians, are brought into a <hi>near relation</hi> to God; they are his Children, and have a right to go up to his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Throne, and there call him Father, and they are also brought into a <hi>near Communion,</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 3. <hi>That which we have seen and heard, declare we unto you, that ye might have fellowship with us; and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Iesus Christ.</hi> And as God hath made it their duty so they do make it their delight to be drawing nigh to him in those Ways which he hath appointed them; hence they love praying and hearing, Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths and Sacraments, means of grace, and actings of grace; and many sweet meeting they have with him, and abundance of benefit and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage they find coming into their Souls by it, <hi>Psal.</hi> 73. 28. <hi>It is good for me to draw near to God,</hi> pleasant and profitable; good as it affords me peace, and good as it promotes my growth; good as it increaseth my grace, and as it adds to my comfort; it is every way, and upon all accounts, good to, draw <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> things of the enamoured Spouse, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 4. <hi>Draw me, we will run after thee.</hi> And the Language of all holy Souls is the very same, for they are not satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with, though thankful for what they have, but are, and while here, will be making out after nearer approaches, &amp; still nearer, not only the banquetting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house-entertainment, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 4. but chamber-fellowship, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3. 4. and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter clearer sights, <hi>Shew me thy glory,</hi> said <hi>Moses;</hi> and after fuller enjoyments. <hi>Stay me with flaggons, comfort me with apples:</hi> Straw me with them, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass, load me with them; and as none of them are so <hi>full</hi> as they would be, so, none of them so <hi>fixed</hi> as they would be; they cannot dwell upon God as they would do, but are guilty of wandrings from him, both out of duty, and in it too; their minds and affections are running away from God, so that they have them to seek while they should be wholly taken up with him; woful flutterings and rovings are the matter of their frequent and sorrowful complaint.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, There will be a distance during the time of this their <hi>mortal</hi> state while they do inhabit the earthly house of this Tabernacle; so long as the Christian is upon Earth, he is not <hi>where</hi> he would be, unless it be for work-sake, and for duties-sake; this is not his own home, but the house of his Pilgrimage; this is not his Country, but a strange Land; this is not his rest, for it is polluted, and he is uneasie; and when he can make his escape, and be upon the wing, and get to Heaven, by raised meditations, flaming affections, and a Gospel-adorning conversation, still he is not there <hi>so as he would be,</hi> not in such a <hi>manner,</hi> nor to such a degree. He is not so often there, nor so much there, nor so long there as he would be; <hi>Rara hora, brevis mora.</hi> He can get up thither too seldom, and he can abide there too little. He is not wholly and altogether there as he would be: when he hath taken a great deal of pains to winde his Soul up, there are heavy weights that press it down, and so there are miserable, vexatious declensions and descensions; through weakness the holy Soul cannot mount up to Heaven so strongly, and through wantonness it cannot abide there so constantly as it would; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides this, the present state is a <hi>state of absence,</hi> which the gracious heart doth not like nor approve; it is grievous and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Thus I have shewn you that there is a distance from the Lord, and that in all men, even the best and most holy, those who have attained to the largest measures, and highest degrees of grace while they are Pilgrims and Strangers here.

Remember it, O Christians? the more you are as by the Spirit of the Lord changed from grace to grace, the more considerable advances you make from lower to higher degrees of holiness; the more will you be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in the spirit of your mind, and changed from glory to glory, the more will you have in you of a Divine Nature, and the more of the Divine Image upon you. In a word, by this means you will come to have a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conformity and likeness unto God, and so a sweeter communion and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timacy with him. So then this is a further return unto God; this is a get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting nearer and nearer to him; and truly this should be the work of every day. This is that which we should have in our designs and aims in all the holy duties that we perform, and in all the precious Ordinances upon which we do attend, that by every one of them we may have a lift given us, and he brought more over, and more close to God than we as yet are.</p>

                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> rest; to the best rest it can have or desire; <hi>viz.</hi> a rest in its God, a rest in the Centre, a rest in the arms and bosom of him who is the supreme object of its love, and pleasant for delights. That rest can want nothing to compleat it, which is a rest in Heaven, a rest in God. But in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the commending to you this return unto God by Death, we will briefly shew these two things. 1. What those things are, from which the Soul doth after Death rest? 2. What are the properties of that rest, which the holy Soul shall then be put into the possession of? First then, What are those things which the holy Soul doth after Death rest from? Unto this I shall answer in these four things.</p>
            <p>First, There will be a rest from all Conflicts, for then it enters into peace, and is encompast about with it. The life of a Christian here is tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughout a combating life; there is not any that flees to Christ as a Saviour, but must, if he would find him so, submit to him as a Lord, and list himself under him as a Captain. Therefore we are expresly commanded to put on the whole Armour of God, and to fight the good fight of Faith, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure hardship as the good Souldiers of Jesus Christ. You must not think to live here wholly at ease and in quiet. Christianity is a warfare. No sooner are you reconciled, and made the Friends of God, but others will be enraged, and become desperate, yea implacable Enemies unto you. Great Enemies there are, potent, cruel, and a great many of them. <hi>Intestine</hi> Enemies, those of our own house, yea nearer yet, those of our own hearts; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are so very near, therefore they are exceeding dangerous. A Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of lusts which war against the Soul; who indeed can tell the number of them? There is fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>sh which lusteth against the spirit; sin against grace; fears, and doubts, and jealousies of God against Faith; sensual and self-love against the love of God; and there are forreign Enemies too. Satan and the World; the <hi>World</hi> one while undermines the Soul by its flattering pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, and another while batters it with its terrible menaces. Now it fawns with <hi>Delilah,</hi> anon it frowns like a fury; and then the <hi>Devil,</hi> who will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be quiet, at one time he comes forth against the Soul in a disguise, like to an Angel of Light, that he may so deceive and surprize it; at another time he will appear in his own shape, as ugly and deformed as it is; for Devils do not know how to blush; I say, he comes as a Prince of darkness, to carry it captive, and fright it into his Net; sometimes the Saints find him hissing as a Serpent, and nibbling at their heels, at other times roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like a Lion, and coming upon them with open mouth, as if he would swallow them at once; so that what with the one and the other, the sin that dwelleth within, and the Enemies that beset and lay close siege without, the poor Christian is oftentimes weary of his life; but when Death comes, it puts an end to all this, it takes the Christian and carries him out of the field, and
<pb facs="tcp:33976:9"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 line">
                  <desc>〈1 line〉</desc>
               </gap> of Salvation, having come off with honour, and obtain'd the Victory, yea, been more than a Conquerour, shall maintain an everlasting Triumph, with their Robes of Glory, and Palms in their hands. When once Death lays them asleep in their graves, the last stroke is struck as to them; they shall not learn nor prosecute this holy War any more.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There will be a rest from trouble and sorrow: As there will be no fightings, so no mournings; as no dangers, so no fighs. This World is a place of trouble, it is full of it. Man is born to trouble, and as it meets him at his birth, so it will accompany him to his grave. When our first Father <hi>Adam</hi> had once transgressed the Law of his Creation, there was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately introduc'd a dismal and astonishing change; the face of the Earth was covered with Briars and Thorns; and who is there among all the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men that hath not his fingers pricked with them? who is there that can pass thorough this Wilderness without multiplied wounds? Indeed the same measure is not meted out to all; every one cannot say, he is plagued all the day long, and chastened every morning, yet there is not one but hath so much as he thinks enough; yea and, it may be, more too. We are sometimes troubled by those that live about us, <hi>Psal.</hi> 57. 4. <hi>My Soul is among Lions, and I lie even among them that are set on fire, whose teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongues are sharp swords:</hi> And we are troubled oftentimes by those that live with us, <hi>Micah</hi> 7. 6. <hi>The Son disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noureth his Father, and the Daughter her Mother; the Daughter-in-law ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth up against her Mother-in-law; a man's Enemies are those of his own house.</hi> How usual a thing is it to see and hear of persons greatly afflicted by their friends and acquaintance; <hi>Caesar</hi> by <hi>Brutus, David</hi> by <hi>Achito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phel, Christ</hi> by a <hi>Iudas,</hi> one of his own Discipl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>s; nay, by our near Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, those that came out of our bowels, rise up against us, and work our ruine? How many are there that have Vipers and vexations in their bosoms? one a treacherous <hi>Delilah,</hi> another a flouting <hi>Michal;</hi> their very Beds are strawed with Thorns, so that they lie uneasie, and in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rise up with aking heads and hearts. Nay, to come nearer yet, how many in the World are their own tormentors, and carry, as if they made it their business and sport to trouble themselves, by their sollicitous and cark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cares, and by their melancholick apprehensions and thoughts, upon which they sit brooding, and hatch an hundred Monsters to their own af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frightment, and by their unbelieving fears, whereby they affront the Vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of God, and question such a Covenant as is everlasting, ordered in all things and sure, and such Promises as are firm like Mountains of Brass, <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Amen;</hi> and also by their vain janglings, and peevish quarrels which they raise without any sense or reason? In short, some have a great deal of trouble in the flesh, and others have a great deal more in the spirit, and not a few in both, and so are in a place where two Seas meet, so that all the waves and billows go over them. But when a Saint dieth, all is over, <hi>the Winter is past, the Rain is over and gone,</hi> and he is at rest from
<pb facs="tcp:33976:9"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 line">
                  <desc>〈1 line〉</desc>
               </gap> not one thing left to trouble him: Everlasting joy shall be upon his head, but sorrow and sighing shall flee away; there shall not then be one single tear left upon his cheek, no nor the least thing that should be the cause of it. As the wicked mans jollity doth at death end in an extremity of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish, so at death the godly mans troubles shall end in a fulness of joy.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, There will also be a rest from all weariness and toilsom labour. Man had work to do in his state of Innocency, being then put into the Garden to dress it, and to keep it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 15. But tedious labour came in upon the fall, was the fruit and punishment of sin; it was not till after that he was to eat his bread in the sweat of his brows; but that is the burden bound upon us in our lapsed and degenerate condition, which we cannot shake off. We must all take a great deal of pains, not only she that grindeth at the Mill, but he too that sitteth upon the Throne. Earth is not to be got by idleness; <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>The sluggard shall be clothed with raggs;</hi> and surely then, Heaven is not to be got without pains: It will not drop into mens laps while they sleep; it was wont to suffer vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and sure its price is not so much fallen, as that now it should come for nothing. It is true, there are gracious influences and assistances from God, but there is required iudustry and utmost diligence of man. It is God that worketh both to will and to do of his own good pleasure; but notwithstanding that; nay, because of that man is obliged and concerned to work out his Salvation with fear and trembling. Many there are that pretend to Religion; and usurp the name of Christians, which belongs no more to them, than that of Man to a Monkey, and bless themselves in a vain confidence of coming to Heaven with less a do, but as great safety as the best and most precise, and so spend their days in mirth and jollity; in s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>h and sensuality, but they shall find themselves mistaken, and to have run away with a Lye in their right hand. Those that are truly gracious, can and will from their own daily experience, tell you, that it is no easie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be a Christian, and to walk with God in an holy close Communion, and to live in the World according to the Law of the New Creature. It doth cost such an one a great deal more than I can tell you to raise his heart, and get it up to a spiritual holy frame fit to attend upon God in an Ordinance, or to approach him in a duty, and it stands him in full out as much to preserve it in such a frame when it is once in it, and to prevent its going down again after it hath been wound up. Heart-raising, and heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixing, are two works of no mean difficulty, too hard indeed for a Child of God, when at his best, if taken alone. <hi>We labour,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>that whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 9. As they were ambitious of it, so they were industrious. But, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 13. <hi>A voice from Heaven said, Blessed are the dead that die in the Lord; yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours, and their works do follow them:</hi> There is no idleness in Heaven, but constant action, but such action as is rest; no labouring to sweat or weariness, but reaping the fruit of

            <p>Lastly, and which is yet more, There will be a rest from all desire. It is a very good observation which that excellent Divine Mr. <hi>Ioseph Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds,</hi> who is now with God, made upon that expression of holy <hi>Asaph, Psal.</hi> 73. 25. <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee? and there is none upon Earth that I desire beside thee.</hi> Heaven is the place of having, but Earth is the place of desiring. And indeed so it is; while the poor Saint is upon Earth, his wants are so many, and his necessities so great, that he is abundantly more in his desires than he is in his attainments. <hi>I have not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready attained,</hi> saith <hi>Paul,</hi> neither am I already perfect; O that I might know him! O that I might apprehend that for which I am apprehended of Christ! O that by any means I might attain to the resurrection of the dead! I forget that which is behind, and reach forth to that which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and press on toward the mark; and there is the same spirit of faith, and love, and desire, and longing in all those that have past through the new birth. Attainments in many of them are little and low, but in all of them desires are high. And though these desires are exceeding good, yet they are very painful, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>arp hunger is to an almost starved creature. How uneasie is a longing Woman! it makes her sick at the very heart, not seldom causeth a faintness and swoonings, and puts her into a great discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posure throughout. So do the desires of a longing Saint; too too often he over-looks, and pays not unto God due acknowledgments for, nor doth he himself tast the sweetness, and take the comfort of what he hath, because he cannot as yet get what he wants. Oh how much doth such an one hasten after a deliverance from sin! How eagerly doth he thirst for increases of grace! How doth he aspire to an holy fixation of mind, free from those avocations and diversions which afflict him! And as the hunted, parched Hart panteth after the Water-brooks, so doth his Soul pant after the Living God, and an intimate unbroken Communion with him; and it is even sick with love and longings, because it finds not what it thus seeks. It doth hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enjoy it self, because it hath not those enjoyments that it would. But when once Death hath done its work upon him, there is a rest from these things too; not because the Souls love is in the least cool'd and abated, for then it is perfected, and raised up to the purest, hottest and highest flame, in which it shall everlastingly continue; but because it hath plenary fruition of that which it loves, of all which it loves. While the gracious Soul is here in the body, it hath its sallyings out, its earnest reaches, and lofty flights: Oh that it were so and so!

               </gap> God more, and love him more, and live him more! But when the Soul comes to Heaven, it takes the place appointed and prepared for it, and there it sits down at ease, because it is where it would be, and as it would be. There is no desire, because a compleat satisfaction, <hi>Psal.</hi> 17. <hi>ult. As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness, I shall be satisfied when I awake with thy likeness:</hi> There desires are turned into, and swallowed up of delights. There is indeed in glorified Souls a natural desire of the resurrection of their bodies, and a reunion to them, but that desire is no impairing of their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, not in the least afflictive, because moderate and rightly tempered, and sweetened with a full assurance that it shall be done at the time appointed by the Father: And in the mean while they are abundantly pleas'd, having a fulness of joy in the vision and fruition of God, Father, Son and Spirit, who is to them infinitely better than the body can be. Come we now to the next thing propounded; <hi>viz.</hi> the properties of that rest into which the holy Soul doth enter after death, or what kind of rest it is; and that I shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to shew you in these three particulars.</p>
            <p>First, It is a compleat rest, every way perfect, there is not any thing want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereunto. There is indeed a sweet and blessed rest which those have here in this life, who come to Christ, and make a believing closure upon the terms propounded in the Gospel; though they have not the rest of the World, yet they have a rest in the World, and that in the midst of concus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions and confusions, when they are tumbled and toss'd up and down, they have a rest out of their Enemies reach: This our dear Lord and Saviour hath promised, and he cannot but be as good as his word, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 28. <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest;</hi> not only a right to it, but the possession of it; that which they could not meet with before, neither in themselves, nor in the creature, they meet with in him; as the <hi>Dove</hi> that could find no place for the sole of its foot when it was abroad, as the <hi>Raven</hi> could, that would light and feed upon Carrion, the dead carcasses floating upon the surface of the waters, yet it found rest in the Ark upon its return to it. Those that before were through the stingings of Conscience, and the apprehensions of Divine wrath, and impending Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as persons upon a Rack, are through the sprinklings of the blood of the Covenant upon them, and the sealings and witnessings of the Spirit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them as in a Bed of Down or Roses: Those wounds that formerly smart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are graciously healed, and their Agonies are over, unless they cause new ones by their foolishness; but for all this, here <hi>aliquid deest,</hi> something is wanting, as well as something amiss. <hi>Paul</hi> in 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3. 10. speaks of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that was <hi>lacking in their Faith,</hi> and truly the same may be affirmed of the best improved, and most grown Saints on this side of Heaven, that there is something lacking in their Faith, yea and in their Love, and in their Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, and Meekness, and Patience, and in all the graces that have been by the blessed Spirit of God wrought in them. And we may be sure of this, that as long as there is something lacking in the grace, there will be something
<pb facs="tcp:33976:11"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 line">
                  <desc>〈1 line〉</desc>
               </gap> not be arrived at a perfect state. But after death all these wants will be supplied, and all these defects made up, there will be no vacancy in the Soul, nothing lacking, then that which is perfect will be come, and so that which is imperfect shall be done away, and hereupon that rest which the Soul shall have when <hi>it comes to Heaven,</hi> will be greater and fuller than that which it had when it first came to Christ, or all the while that it lived a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journer in the World, there will be perfect holiness, and by consequence there will be a perfect happiness. God will not in any thing be behind hand with his people, or wanting to them, there they are continually before the Throne of God, always in his presence, and <hi>David</hi> tells us, <hi>Psal.</hi> 16. 11. That <hi>in his presence</hi> there is fulness of joy, and a fulness of joy doth necessarily imply and carry along with it, a fulness of rest and that which followeth hereupon.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is an undisturbed rest. Here our peace is oftentimes broken, and our rest is gone. It is said of <hi>Ahasuerus,</hi> that he could not sleep, his sleep fled away from him, he did all that in him lay to compose himself, he would gladly have slept, but he could not. So it is Spiritually with the Saints themselves, their rest fleeth from them. Sometimes they break their own rest, <hi>Psal.</hi> 38. <hi>There is no rest in my bones because of my sin,</hi> and as there was none in his bones, so none in his flesh, and none in his Spirit; and sometimes God breaks their rest, one while he gives them rest round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, at another time he makes them fear round abou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Iob</hi> 7. 13, 14. <hi>When I say my Bed shall comfort me, my Couch shall ease my complaint, then thou scarest me with Dreams and terrifiest me with Visions.</hi> Oh the dismal thoughts that some good people have in the night, they lie down with holy and gracious thoughts, with believing thoughts, with God admiring thoughts but in their sleep they have Vain, Absurd, Defiling and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieting thoughts; so that they wake in an affright, and as the Psalmist, tells us, <hi>sometimes sorrow endures for a night, and joy comes in the morning.</hi> So experience tells us that at other times joy endures for a day, and sorrow comes in the Evening. The bright and comfortable sun sets in a dark Cloud. <hi>David</hi> reckoned without his host when in <hi>Psal.</hi> 30. he thought his Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain stood strong, his State of Peace and Prosperity was firm and unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, so that he should never be moved, that he should never more feel what broken bones meant, nor be any more hunted by his enemy as a Partridge upon the Mountains, nor be again smitten and almost consumed by the blow of the Divine hand, nor have his moisture turned into the drought of Summer. But he was quickly convinced of his mistake, <hi>God hid his face and he was troubled.</hi> So troubled as that he was at his wits end, almost be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side himself, both Counsel and Courage failed him. But now when once the Soul comes to Heaven, there shall be nothing of a disturbance, no such inroads made upon its peace, but a perpetual Serenity and Calm, a clear Sun-shine without any Eclipse or Clouds, or Overcastings. No hiding of the face of God, no damp upon the Soul. No frown without, no fear

               </gap> an holy reception, no anger in God to obstruct and stop his gracious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication. God will be continually giving out of himself and the Soul shall be continually taking in. The glorified Soul shall be always full up to the brim, and as God shall please according to the exceeding riches of his grace and kindness to dart forth new beams and rays of his glory, so he will strengthen the eye that it shall behold them with inconceivable delight and pleasure, as he shall please to open his hand of Love, so he will widen the Vessel, and inlarge its capacity.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It will be an everlasting rest, as it knows no disturbance, so no end. The Soul for certain shall not sleep, as some have fondly and foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishly imagined, the body indeed doth, that enjoys a sweet sleep in its bed, of dust, where it lies in Jesus, for death hath not broken the Union between it and Christ, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4. 14. <hi>Them which sleep in Iesus shall God bring with him.</hi> But the Soul sleeps not, it is not suitable to the nature of it, it meets with enough to keep it awake. Yea, it will be so far from sleeping, as that it shall not so much as wink, for it shall not know any such thing as lassitude or weariness. It shall be continually acting, and that with Strength and Vigour, to the utmost of its power, and yet not be tyred by those actings. The bow shall be always bent, yet not hereupon grow a Slug, but abide in strength. But though the Soul shall never sleep, yet it shall always rest, when it is once entered into it, it shall abide and never come out more; there are, as you have heard from the Word, pleasures for evermore, and therefore there shall be rest for evermore. O Eternity, Eternity, its length is not to be measured, but its weight and importance to be seriously consider'd, that is the sweet ingredient in the joys above, and that the Gall which is put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Cup of trembling and astonishment below; the damned in Hell shall be in everlasting misery, their worm dieth not, and the glorified Souls shall have an everlasting felicity. Let us apply to this those sweet expressions which we find in <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. 15, 16, 17. <hi>They are before the Throne of God,</hi> as Heavens Courtiers and Favourites whom the King of Kings loves to look upon. <hi>They serve him day and night in his Temple.</hi> They shall be altogether taken up with God, their whole business and employment shall be about God. <hi>And he that sits upon the throne shall dwell among them.</hi> And there cannot be better Company, none so good. His presence is enough alone, <hi>they shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more.</hi> It is impossible they should be hungry who are at such a feast, or thirst, who have not only their Cups running over, but are continually refreshing and bathing themselves in a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of pleasure and of life, clear as Christal, which proceeds out of the Throne of God and of the Lamb, <hi>neither shall the Sun light on them nor any beat,</hi> there shall be beams to refresh them, but none to scorch them. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that shall render them faint or uneasy. <hi>For the Lamb which is in the midst of the Throne shall feed them.</hi> He loves to do it, and he will be sure to give them the best, and with a large liberal hand, <hi>and shall lead them to fountains of living water,</hi> all fresh and pure, and at the first hand, and <hi>God</hi>

In this case sinners must be speechless, or they will not be able to say any thing to purpose: Whereas on the other side, there is a great deal of reason why those that have gone from him should return to him. Assoon as ever the Prodigal came to himself he thought it his best and wisest course to go to his Father. And there is also highest reason why those that live here in his love and fear, should desire to go from hence that they may live with him in his Kingdom and Glory. In the remainder of this discourse I shall speak only concerning the Souls return to God at death, and its willing and chearful readiness so to do. Christians, let me suppose you standing upon the Worlds higher ground, having the Sun of prosperity shining upon your Tabernacle, with waters of a full Cup wrung out unto you. Let your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions here be never so full and pleasant, your life never so sweet, not made up of nights of trouble and months of vanity, but all good and halcyon; let your enjoyments be never so abounding, and your Communion with God never so close and intimate; though your peace be as a River, and your righteousness in the delightful fruits thereof as the Waves of the Sea, yet this should not glue and fasten you to the World; in the midst of all this your heart should be weaned, and willing to be gone, as knowing this is not your rest. <hi>Peter</hi> is looked upon as forgetting himself when upon the <hi>transfiguration of Christ,</hi> he said, <hi>Lord it is good to be here, if thou wilt let us make here three Tabernacles,</hi> &amp;c. Where saith one, there are <hi>plura ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surda quam verba,</hi> more absurdities than there are words. <hi>Paul</hi> that had been in the third Heaven was not for building but for the pulling down and dissolving of the Tabernacle. Nay the comfortable enjoyments which you have now, and Gods dealing bountifully with you at present both in tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals andSpirituals, should make you willing and desirous to be gone, that you may know what the best will be, whensoever God is pleased to call for you, and by that grim Messenger Death, saith, <hi>come up hither,</hi> you should with gladness, and rejoycing say, Go my Soul, make no tarrying, shew no loth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, but with a smile and holy transport take thy last farewel of all these Earthly Friends and Enjoyments, of all these sublunary drossie delights, and welcom the Messenger that is sent for thee; though he should handle thy body roughly, yet let patience have its perfect work, and take it kindly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause thou shalt return to thy rest, and quickly be with that God from whom thou didst first come, whose face thou shalt behold in righteousness. Now that gracious and bountiful dealing which you have found at his hand all the time that you have spent in the world, notwithstanding your ill deservings and unanswerable walkings may very well contribute greatly to this wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingness, and be a mighty encouragement; as they do strongly oblige you to <hi>duty here,</hi> so they should do more than reconcile you to a departure hence. That, I hope, will appear evidently to you upon a threefold account.</p>
            <p>First, This bountiful dealing of <hi>God</hi> with you is a plain and evident de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration of that fulness, which is in him; by the liberality of his hand, you may judge something of the greatness of his stock; Who is a God like

               </gap> what a blessed exchange do you make when you come to die! You leave a company of broken Cisterns, that are little, and leaking, can hold no water, but frequently fail your expectations, and leave you at that loss they find you in, and then you go to a living Fountain, that is ever full and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing: You go out of an earthly Clay Cottage, which is crazy and tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering, and the keeping of it in repair puts you to a great deal of trouble and charge, and when you have done your utmost, it must tumble, and then you take possession of an house not made with hands, eternal in the Heavens, whose builder and maker is God, and which was by him made for the place of his everlasting residence, the habitation of his holiness and glory; so that by all you part with here, you will be no losers, but change unspeakably to your advantage. Are there any of you that have got good hope through grace, that have had your Faith of Adherence crowned with that of Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance? one would rationally conclude you as willing to go to Heaven as <hi>Israel</hi> was to see <hi>Egypt</hi> upon their backs, which had been to them an house of bondage and great servitude, or to make haste through an howling and inhospitable Wilderness, that they might come to a <hi>Canaan,</hi> a Land of desire, flowing with Milk and Honey. I beseech you, Christians, seriously to reflect upon things that are past, and consider what doth now come from <hi>God,</hi> what you have received since you did accept and embrace an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered <hi>Iesus,</hi> and what you are still receiving. How many common mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, than the least of which you are less; and how many special mercies upon which you may read <hi>Love:</hi> you are not able to number them, being more than the hairs upon your heads. How many messages of peace have been brought to you by his Ministers and Spirit? How many comfortable Answers hath he given? so that you have been constrained to say, He hath not turned away your prayer, nor his mercy from you! How many rich tokens hath he blest you with, every one of greater value than an Orient Pearl, or glistering Diamond? How many marks of Covenant-favour hath he set upon you! In short, how often and how greatly hath he made your Souls to rejoyce, and your Hearts to leap within you! and then how well may you argue thus with your selves, If there be so much coming from <hi>God,</hi> what is there in God? If there be such conveyances made by the Pipes of Ordinances and Duties, what is there in him, in whom <hi>are all my Springs?</hi> If messages be so delicious, what are the closest embraces? If there be such beams at a distance, such comfortable beams and vital influences communicated in this state of absence, what light and life, what beauty and glory is there in the Eternal Sun!</p>
            <p>Secondly, From this bountiful dealing of God with you, you may argue to his liberality, and the singular pleasure which he takes in giving forth of that his fulness to his People, which is infinitely beyond the delight of the most affectionate Mother in drawing her full and pained Breast to her suck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and smiling Infant. Death, it is true, will carry you from all your enjoyments in this World, it will strip you to your skins, and not so much

                  <desc>〈1 line〉</desc>
               </gap> you do now taste the greatest sweetness, and from which you fetch your grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test comfort: You must shake hands with faithful Friends, dearest Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Possessions; your places and preferments, your worldly honours and preheminences will know you no more. <hi>If a man die,</hi> saith <hi>Iob, shall he live again?</hi> Yes, he shall, but not in the same place, not in the same state, not to the same ends and purposes that he did before. But what of all that? if you be such as you ought to be, and mind that for which you were sent hither, you shall at death go directly to him who is able to do for you far more abundantly than all these things could do, and to supply all your needs according to his riches in glory; and since he is able, you may by the sufficient warrant both of his Promise, and your own Experiences, say, I am sure also that he will do it. That God who hath been so good, so exceeding good to you here, you have no reason to question but he will be as good to you there. You have seen how mindful he is of his Covenant, and faithful to his Promises, &amp; how much his heart is set upon your good, &amp; his name is, <hi>I am;</hi> though the Heavens wax old like a garment, and shall be chang'd as a Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, yet he is always the same, without any variableness or shadow of turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as great as ever, as full as ever, yea and as good as ever. It is not strange that good old <hi>Iacob,</hi> and all his family were forward to go into <hi>Egypt,</hi> when <hi>Ioseph,</hi> who had already been so kind to them, sent this encouraging invitation, <hi>Come to me, for I will give you the good of the Land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>and you shall eat the fat of the Land; regard not your stuff, for the good of all the Land of</hi> Egypt <hi>is before you.</hi> Oh! saith the Text, <hi>when they had told him all the words of</hi> Joseph, <hi>and when he saw the Waggons which</hi> Joseph <hi>had sent to carry him, his spirit revived, and he said, It is enough,</hi> Joseph <hi>is yet alive, I will go and see him, Gen.</hi> 45. 27, 28. How much more may you be of the same mind? how much more readily may you set up your Sail for the other World, when God saith, Come, my Son, my Daughter, come away, come to me, regard not your stuff, all the good of Heaven is before you? And when you see the Messenger that must carry you hence, you may take Heart, this may be, as they are wont to say, a lightning before death; my God is still alive, and my Saviour still alive, and he lives for evermore, I will go and see him, and live with him; I can tell what he is, I am sure he hath been a loving God to me, and that he delighteth in mercy. I have many and many a time tasted that he is gracious, and therefore I will not fear him now: Since mercy and goodness have followed me all the days of my life, I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever: What though I am going to another world, yet I shall be with the same God; and blessed are they that dwell in his house, for they are still praising. Heaven, whither I am to go, is filled with glory and admiration, and rings with <hi>Allelujahs.</hi> And then, which follows hereupon,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, These bountiful dealings of God with his people are a very firm and solid foundation upon which they may without fear build their comfortable hopes and expectations for Eternity. Mercies to such are like
<pb facs="tcp:33976:14"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 line">
                  <desc>〈1 line〉</desc>
               </gap> pay the debts she owed, and upon the rest she was to live. So in mercies which you receive from God, there is the mercy it self to answer the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent occasion, to discharge the present expence, and then there is the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to live upon for the future. Thus the Saints have argued from Gods former dealings with them to his further dealings with them. So <hi>David</hi> did, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. 37. <hi>The Lord that delivered me from the paw of the Lion, and out of the Paw of the Bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine.</hi> And such were the noble and heroick actings of <hi>Pauls</hi> faith, he having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the same Spirit of Faith, and being at that time under the like influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 9, 10. <hi>We had the Sentence of death in our selves, that we should not trust in our selves, but in God which raiseth the dead, who deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us from so great a death, and doth deliver; in whom we trust, that he will yet deliver.</hi> And the like we meet with in Psal. 23. 5, 6. <hi>Thou preparest a Table before me in the presence of mine enemies, thou anointest mine head with Oyl, my Cup runneth over.</hi> But possibly, <hi>David,</hi> this will not last, God hath done all for thee that he intends, he will now stay his hand, nay but saith he, I am certain that he will not. <hi>Surely mercy and goodness shall follow me all the days of my life.</hi> Thus they have argued unto further mercies in time, and you may take a further reach and argue from your present experiences to mercies for Eternity, <hi>Psal.</hi> 84. 11. <hi>The Lord God is a Sun and a Shield.</hi> That our sense speaks him to be. We are now refreshed with his beams, and secured by his shadow, but what will he be, and what will he do? Let faith answer, <hi>he will give grace and glory.</hi> Grace enough for time, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry enough for ever. Grace to enable us for our duties, glory to satisfy our desires. Grace to fit us for glory, and glory to Compleat and Crown our Grace. These are the proper arguings of faith, and exceeding strong in the hand of a true Believer, the premises are Gods own, and the conclusion drawn from them is undeniable. He is a loving Father to me in this World, and he will be so in the next too. He that now is a fountain opened, send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth such precious and plentiful Streams, will not then prove a Spring shut up and a Fountain sealed. He that affords me such large Clusters while I am in the wilderness, will not starve nor stint me when I come to Heaven. He that feeds me with <hi>Manna</hi> here will never grudge me the Honey and Milk of the Land of promise. Certainly I shall not there enjoy least where according to the promise I look for most, my God will then do far more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly than I am now able to ask or think. These present bountiful dispensations of God to his people are great grounds of high expectations, if we consider,</p>
            <p>First, While the People of God are here they are in their Non-age and Minority. There is an apparent and sensible difference between them. In their <hi>growth,</hi> some are as <hi>Cedars,</hi> others but <hi>Shrubs;</hi> and in their <hi>strength</hi> some are as mighty men to run a race, others can hardly draw their Leg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> after them. A great deal of difference there is in their <hi>knowledge</hi> and in their <hi>Grace,</hi> but both one and other are under age; but when God doth come by
<pb facs="tcp:33976:14"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 line">
                  <desc>〈1 line〉</desc>
               </gap> Children home to Heaven, they are arrived at their ripeness of years. Now if they receive so much from God as they do, and are maintained at such a rate while they are Children, what is it that God designs them for, what is it that he will bestow upon them at last? When you see young ones brought up in Splendor and Bravery, you immediately conclude them to be some great Persons Children, and that they shall have a great Estate, and that something is intended for them suitable to their garb and education. Take your measures from the pains that God takes with his people now, and the cost he is at upon them, and then judge what he hath in his heart and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose concerning them, <hi>when that which is perfect shall come, that which is imperfect shall be done away,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 10. When the eye is fully strengthened there shall be no more use of a Glass to see in, which gives but a dark sight. When the heir comes to understand how to mannage his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, he shall be put into possession of the whole. So when once the Saints come to be perfected in themselves, all imperfections shall be removed from their enjoyments. When once they come to be fit for great things they shall be sure to have them; the inheritance of the Saints in light shall be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them when meet to be made partakers of it. The marriage of the Lamb will come when the B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ide hath made her self ready; and the far more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding and eternal weight of glory will be laid on when the shoulder is in a Capacity of bearing it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In this life the Children of God are fitting for the enjoyment of that which God intend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> them. This life is not a season for a full possession, but for the bringing them into a due preparation. And accordingly here they have only their allowances because as yet they are not fit for more. You read in <hi>Esth.</hi> 2. 9. <hi>That when</hi> E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ther <hi>was brought to the Custody of</hi> Hegai <hi>the Keeper of the VVomen, she had the things given her for purification, with all that belonged to her, and seven Maidens that were meet to be given her.</hi> All that was suitable to that State, and no more. It was not before her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing throughly prepared, purified, and presented to King <hi>Ahasuerus</hi> and by him accepted and chosen to be his Wife, that she had the Crown set upon her head, and the Robes and Ensigns of Majesty given her, which were suitable to her advancement and Royal State. Come, Christians, you have now no cause of murmuring and discontent, but of grateful acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and admirings, God is exceeding gracious, you receive very much, and are daily laden with his benefits; there are blessed allowances which he is pleased to make unto you, such as are suitable to your present conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, day unto day sheweth hislove, and night unto night his faithfulness, what is the report, what the account that you are obliged to give of him? Must you not say that you have enough to support you under all your burdens, when they are most heavy, enough to maintain you at your work, and to carry you thorough it when most difficult, and also enough to sweeten your bitterest afflictions to you, and such beams of light breaking in upon you, that you can walk thorough darkness, and comfortably proceed in your
<pb facs="tcp:33976:15"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 line">
                  <desc>〈1 line〉</desc>
               </gap> by God, which will prepare you for the Crown of Life and Righteousness, which God the Righteous Judge shall give unto you at that day, and make you meet for the Throne of Glory, unto which you shall be advanced, so that you may become it, and fit you for the presence of God, that you may be brought into it with exceeding joy, that you may be able to bear his presence without terrour and trembling, and he to bear you in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, without hatred and loathing. In a word, you have that now afforded you by God, which may suit you both to the place, and company, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, so that when you come there, there may be an amicable agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and perfect harmony, without any thing of jarring and discord, that you may not be weary of Heaven, nor Heaven of you. And do you se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously consider how much this stands God in? what abundance of cost he is at for your preparation, and what a great deal of pains he takes with you in order thereunto; which clearly shews it to be no small or inconsiderable thing which he hath in his everlasting love and kindness designed you for? The beauty of the Wedding Garment, which every one of the Guests must have on in order to his acceptance, doth loudly proclaim the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Solemnity, and the splendor of the Entertainment; and when once full preparation is made in the Soul, full possession shall be given to it. When once the Vessel is thoroughly cleansed, it shall be filled up to the brim. When once the Divine Spirit hath made you meet, you shall receive the Inheritance of the Saints in Light, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 10. <hi>The Bridegroom came, and they that were ready went in with him to the Marriage, and the door was shut.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, Consider what that life is which God will have his People to live while they are here in the world; <hi>viz.</hi> the life of Faith; so the Lord himself hath told us, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2. 4. <hi>Behold his Soul which is lifted up is not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in him, but the just shall live by his faith.</hi> And this must be at all times, and in all conditions; not only when it is with us as it was then, when <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans,</hi> mighty and cruel Enemies are in the Land, but when they are not; when we have Enemies under our feet, and fulness in our hands, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 7. <hi>We,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>walk by faith, and net by sight;</hi> faith leads, faith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects, faith supports, faith comforts. Thus it is with all the Saints; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he speaks in the plural number, <hi>we,</hi> meaning both himself and all the followers of the Lamb; and of himself he particularly tells us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20. <hi>I am crucified with Christ, nevertheless I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.</hi> Christ lived in him; all his life came from Christ; he was the Author and Principle of it; he both brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed and maintains it; he it is that quickens me, acts me, moves me how and whither he pleaseth; and whatever that life be which I shall live here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, that life which I now live, in this world, in this mortal body and state, I live it by the faith of Christ, in whom I have both righteousness, and life, and strength; for he is, and he is to me <hi>all in all.</hi> And so it is with all the

                  <desc>〈1 line〉</desc>
               </gap> sense, more by hope than by having; and yet this present and imperfect life is an exceeding excellent and noble life: It is as much above the life of the most rational man in the world, who is a stranger to the grace of faith, as the life of such a man is above the life of a brute; it brings in to him far more sweetness and pleasure: Hence it is that in the Scripture you read of <hi>peace</hi> in believing, and of the joys of faith, with which those which the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sualist doth enjoy, are not worthy to be compared, for his peace is but the product of a delusion, his joy as the crackling of thorns under a pot; but this is <hi>peace which passeth all understanding, Phil.</hi> 4. 7. and this joy such as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

If there be such consolations springing, such holy raptures caused from and by that good <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But what say you, is there the Company of two Armies in you? Is there a Law in your minds warring against that Law of Sin and Death which is in your members? Is there a Spirit within you lust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing against the flesh; is there a contest and combating within you? And that not only between one faculty and another, but between the same facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and itself? So that you cannot sin with that freedom and plenary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent that you were wont to do, but you find a reluctancy and opposition in your selves.

You that are Elder, and are yet in your sins, walking on in the vanity of your minds, suffer the word of exhortation, do you return, and that presently, for you have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to shew why you should not; you have taken your swing, and rambled far enough, and lived without God long enough; a man would think you have had your belly full of wind and ashes, and husks, that you have had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of base sins, and what is worse than childish vanities, and are guilty of such egregious, and ruining follies that you have reason to be weary of them.

You that are younger, do ye apply your hearts to true wisdom, come, ye Children, hearken to me, come, ye young-men and maidens, come in to God, who desires you, who calls you, who stands with his arms ready and stretched out to receive you, come to him in whom you will find rest to your Souls, and have such joys as will be great and cheap, and never end in sorrow.

Consider and call to mind, what sights have you had of Gods power and glory in the Sanctuary. What tasts of his sweetness in the ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetting house of Ordinances, what tokens of love sent in, in various ways, what Messages of peace by his holy and blessed Spirit, what returns of prayer by the hand of gracious providences; how great things hath God done for you, consuting your fears, and exceeding your expectations, how good and gracious hath he been to you, compassing you about with his favour as with a Shield, and daily loading you with his benefits? let all this be called in and set before your eyes, and then from all these Topicks reason the case with your selves, and plead with your Souls, yea plead and argue them into a dearer affection to God, and a further return to him, and a nearer, closer Communion with him.

And when the Spouse had once got the scent, and to her comfort and delight felt the savour of it, found that sweetness which was both in his name and in himself, she loved him, her affections presently took wing and made out to him, she run, and yet thought her pace was too slow, and therefore beg'd she might be drawn that so she might run. Her senses had been exercised and pleased with so excellent and glorious an object, and now she was satisfied neither with what she had, nor what she did, she thought her strength was too small, her motions too faint and heavy. She could not rid ground fast enough, and though she followed hard after him, she was yet too far from him. <hi>Draw me, and we will run after thee.</hi> We will run after thee faster than now we do, and get nearer to thee than now we are, and this calling in of divine help was not in vain, it was presently
