            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Give you herein an account of our Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on yeſterday, being the 28. ſuch as at preſent can be made, having not had time to learn the Particulars of the Enemies loſſes. The foul weather before having given us opportunity and leiſure to ſound all the Sands; on the 27. it was reſolved at a Council of War, held here on board with the Flag Officers, to attack the Enemy Riding at Anchor in a Line between the <hi>Rand</hi> and the <hi>Stony-bank.</hi> Accordingly a Squadron was then ordered out of the ſeveral Diviſions of the Fleet (whereof the Eldeſt Captain was to command each Party) conſiſting in all of 35 Frigars, and 13 Fireſhips, beſides ſmall Craft to ſound be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them. Yeſterday morning about 8 of the Clock, they draw out of their Squadrons, and ſailed towards the Enemy, the Wind at <hi>S. S. W.</hi> and by 12 a Clock at Noon Engaged the Van of them, Commanded by <hi>Trump:</hi> We were forced to Engage ſooner then I intended, to prevent the Enemies get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Wind. That Squadron ſo commanded by <hi>Trump</hi> was
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50654:3"/>
ſo preſt by us, that it gave way, and retired as far as the Sands would give them leave. The Squadron commanded by <hi>De Ruyter</hi> fell to the ſhare of Count-<hi>D' Eſtrees,</hi> and the <hi>French,</hi> who behaved themſelves very bravely. Sir <hi>Edward Spragge</hi> alſo on his ſide maintained the Fight with ſo much courage and reſolution, that their whole Body gave way to ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, that had it not been for fear of the Shoals, we had driven them into their Harbours, and the King would have had a better account of them. The caſe being thus, and the night approaching, I judged it fit to ſtand a little off, and to Anchor here where I now Ride.</p>
            <p>The Enemy have had a conſiderable Loſs (which they will not eaſily repair having many Men Slain, many Ships Diſabled, and ſome Deſtroyed, <hi>de Ruyter</hi> and <hi>Trump</hi> had run a great Hazard of being Burnt by ſome of our Fireſhips, if they had Behaved themſelves as they ought to have done. Our Loſſes are very inconſiderable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> two of our Ships onely being Diſabled, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Cambridge</hi> and the <hi>Reſolution,</hi> which I ſhall ſend home to Refit; the reſt of our Work will be eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done here. We have loſt very few Common Men; as yet I have an account but of theſe Officers Slain, Captain <hi>Fowles,</hi> Captain <hi>Woerden,</hi> and Captain <hi>Finch;</hi> Colonel <hi>Hamilton</hi> has his Leg ſhot off. All the Officers and Common Men, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally behaved themſelves very well, of which I ſhall ſend the Particulars, when I am better informed; In my Squadron more eſpecially Captain <hi>Leg,</hi> Sir <hi>John Holmes,</hi> Captain <hi>Wett<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wang,</hi> Captain <hi>Story,</hi> Sir <hi>Roger Strickland,</hi> and Sir <hi>William Reeves,</hi> the firſt took a Ship of the Enemies, and the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter brought up a Fireſhip, and layd himſelf to Leeward of <hi>Trump,</hi> and if the Captain of the Fireſhip had done his Duty, <hi>Trump</hi> had been certainly Burnt; Notwithſtanding which, <hi>Story</hi> and <hi>Wettwang</hi> ſo Belaboured him, that <hi>Reeves</hi> cleared himſelf from the Crowd of the Enemy. I hope His Majeſty will be Satisfied, that conſidering the Place we En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in, and the Sands, there was as much done as could be expected. And thus I leave it to His Majeſties Favourable Conſtruction, to whom I wiſh many happy Years to come, this being His Birth-day.</p>
