         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

not returning a farre off, but rejoycing in the

            <p>The ayme of our walking with God here is to

ſhall not wee finde ſweetneſſe in the firſt fruits of a

encourage your ſelves and all others that love the
Lord Jeſus, to goe on through him who doth enable

a taſte of that Spirit whereinto theſe poore Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures

in the Worke of God will inforce a leaſure, to view
the whole, this in Generall wee may ſay, that in the
<pb facs="tcp:172419:4"/>
Wilderneſſe are waters broken out, and ſtreames in
the Deſert, the parched ground is become a Poole,
and the thirſty Land-ſprings of water: in the Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Dragons where each lay, there is graſſe with
Reeds and Ruſhes, the Lord hath powred water
upon him that is thirſtie, and flouds upon the dry
ground; He hath powred his Spirit on the ſeeds of
the Heathen, &amp; his bleſſing on their Off-ſpring, they
ſpring up as among the graſſe, as willowes by the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-courſes:
One ſayes I am the Lords, and another
calls himſelfe by the name of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and another ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes

himſelfe by the name of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> The Lord hath done a
new thing, and wee know it, he hath made a way in
the Wilderneſſe, and Rivers in the Deſert, the beaſt
of the feild doth honour him, the Dragons, and the
Owles becauſe he gives waters in the Wildernes, and
Rivers in the Deſert, to give drinke to his People
his choſen. So that upon the Report heere read unto
us, wee cannot but glorifie God with thoſe Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
beleevers, and ſay, then hath God alſo to the
poore naked <hi>Indians</hi> granted Repentance unto life.
Their outward wants and ſtreights have often been
preſented unto you; wee ſhall not need to repeate
them, bleſſed be the Lord, and bleſſed be you of
the Lord that your hearts have been ſtirred up to
give encouragement unto this Worke, and to open
a Doore for the reliefe of thoſe Eminent Inſtruments
in the hand of the Lord who there carry it on, who
though they communicate to them Spiritualls, yet are
ſo farre from receiving of their Temporalls, that they
impart unto them a Portion of their own dayly bread,
and proviſion neceſſary from their owne ſubſiſtence.</p>
            <p>The good Lord lay the weight and concernment of

this Worke upon your ſpirits, and wee no way doubt
that you will in any way be wanting to the Publique
improvement of this bleſſed opportunitie, for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement

doe love: There is a vexation of ſpirit, which through

Goſpel is perverted, being made <hi>another Goſpel,</hi> by
ſtrange Interpretations; one of the great acts of <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi>
of our times, ſtealing the ſence of the Scripture
from the words of the Scripture. Now to ſee the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
lifted up <hi>as an Enſigne to the Nations,</hi> and <hi>they to flow
unto it,</hi> ſhould be matter of great rejoycing to the
ſoules of thoſe who love the Goſpel in ſinceritie.</p>
            <p>Thirdly <hi>Hereby the ſoules of men are reſcued out of the
ſnare of the Devill,</hi> in which they were before held cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
at his will; The Lord hath manifeſted that there
is a <hi>ſeed according to the Election of grace,</hi> even amongſt
theſe alſo as well as other Gentiles, that the Lord hath
viſited them to take out of them <hi>a people for his Name,</hi>
yea that even they who in a more immediate manner
among them worſhipped the Devill, their Witches
call'd in their language <hi>Pawwawes,</hi> that even theſe
ſhould be deliver'd, <hi>Satan falling from Heaven like light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

our hearts; the great Love of God, is Love to Soules,
and our tendereſt compaſſion ſhould be manifeſted
<pb facs="tcp:172419:6"/>
in pittying of Soules, neither know wee any other
ordinary way that the Lord has appointed but the
preaching of the Goſpel for the winning of Soules to
himſelfe: <hi>That being the Power of God to ſalvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Hereby the fullnes of the Gentiles draws
neere to be accompliſhed,</hi> that the calling of the <hi>Jewes</hi>
may be haſtned: the Scripture ſpeaks of a <hi>double con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion</hi>
of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> the firſt before the converſion
of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> they being <hi>Branches wilde by nature</hi> graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into the <hi>True Olive Tree</hi> in ſtead of the <hi>naturall Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi>
which are broken off. This fullneſſe of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi>
ſhall come in before the converſion of the <hi>Jewes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Brightman <hi>in</hi> Cant. 8. 8. Mede <hi>in</hi> Apoc cap. 7. p. 56.</note>
and till then <hi>blindneſſe hath hapned unto Iſrael,</hi> Rom. 11.
25. The Second, after the converſion of the <hi>Jewes,</hi>
as appeares <hi>Acts 15 16, 17. After this I will returne and
will build againe the Tabernacle of David which is fallen
downe, and I will build againe the ruines thereof, and I will
ſet it up; that the reſidue of men might ſeek after the Lord,
and all the Gentiles upon whom my Name is called ſayth the
Lord.</hi> Hence it appeares that there are ſome <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
upon whom the Lords Name is called that are a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to him, even whilſt the <hi>Tabernacle of David</hi> lyes in
its ruines; and when he hath built againe this <hi>Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle
of David,</hi> that there are a reſidue of men, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> that ſhall enquire after the
Lord, and worſhip him, together with thoſe <hi>Gentiles</hi>
that were formerly converted, and upon whom his
Name was called. The firſt converſion of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi>
in <hi>its fullneſſe</hi> makes way for the coming in of the
<hi>Jewes,</hi> the <hi>King of the Eaſt,</hi> therefore to ſee this worke
goe on, ſhould cauſe the people of God to lift up their
heads, and expect that the Time of the fullfilling
that Promiſe is neere.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>That the Lord hath bleſſed the labours of our
<pb facs="tcp:172419:7"/>
Brethren,</hi> who were driven out from among us: A
gracious heart as he prayes for, ſo he cannot but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
in the ſucceſſe of other mens labours as well as
his owne, ſo the worke which is Gods may proſper,
who ever be the Inſtrument; 'tis enough to him.
When <hi>Peter</hi> gave an account to the Apoſtles and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
of the Converſion of <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his family,
who were, as it were the <hi>firſt fruits of the Gentiles,</hi> they
all glortfied God, ſaying; <hi>Then hath God alſo to the
Gentiles granted Repentance unto life,</hi> Act. 11. 18. And
if they could rejoyce in the Converſion of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi>
which they knew would be with the rejection
of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> how much more ſhould wee rejoyce
in this great worke, who may grow together upon
the ſame good Olive Tree! That when other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
who have planted in thoſe furtheſt parts of the
Earth, have onely ſought their owne advantage
to poſſeſſe their Land, Tranſport their gold, and that
with ſo much covetouſneſſe and cruelty, that they
have made the name of Chriſtianitie and of Chriſt an
abomination, that the Lord ſhould be pleaſed to
make uſe of our Brethren that went forth from us to
make manifeſt <hi>the ſavour of Chriſt</hi> among the people,
and to winne their ſoules to him; How ſhould wee
rejoyce that the Lord hath ſo farre proſper'd ſuch an
undertaking. It was a holy ambition in <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>preach
the Goſpel where Christ was not named,</hi> that he might
not glory in another mans line: It is certainly a great
honour to be Inſtrumentall to bring ſoules to Chriſt,
who before never heard of his Name.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, <hi>This wee hope may be but the firſt fruits of
thoſe great Nations unto Chriſt,</hi> the Lord doth not uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<hi>cauſe to bring forth and then ſhut the wombe,</hi> Iſa. 66.
9. Let no man deſpiſe the day of <hi>ſmall things,</hi> the Lord
<pb facs="tcp:172419:7"/>
hath opened a <hi>great doore,</hi> which we hope Satan ſhall
never be able any more to ſhut.</p>
            <p>Such Conſiderations as theſe, have filled and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
our hearts, in the reading and meditation of this
great worke of the Lord, and wee hope being commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated,
may be a good means to awaken the godly
and faithfull of this Nation, to obſerve the Preſence
and appearances of God amongſt his people there,
that wee alſo may ſay; <hi>What ſhall we doe for our Siſter
in the day that ſhee ſhall be ſpoken for?</hi> Shall we not be
abundant in Prayer, that the Lord would yet further
bleſſe their holy endevours? Shall wee not labour to
ſtrengthen their hands by miniſtering to them of our
aboundance? that they may not be diſcouraged in
ſo eminent a ſervice, one of the greateſt workes that
hath been upon the wheele in this latter age, for to
Contribute to the offering up of Soules to Chriſt,
muſt needs be a Sacrifice of a very ſweet ſmelling ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
unto God. This wee humbly offer unto all
thoſe that love the Lord Jeſus in ſinceritie, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine</p>

ſorts. <hi>Viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. This worke of Gods grace growes in <hi>New-England,</hi>
not onely in the places where the Goſpel was formerly
preached to the <hi>Indians;</hi> But God hath ſtirred up two
Eminent Miniſters in two other parts of the Countrey, to
labour in the worke, not without ſucceſſe anſwerable; as

a place about the ſame diſtance from <hi>Sandwich</hi> another

Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>2. Where the Act of <hi>Parliament</hi> for the Collection
meets with Goſpel-ſpirited Miniſters and people, there wee
finde a good account of it comparatively; God having
ſtirr'd up the hearts of ſome Eminent Chriſtians to con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tribute
in a conſiderable manner; Some by charging thei
Lands with a yearely Revenue to the Corporation for that
end for ever: and others by ſending in good ſummes of
money, ſubſcribing to pay yearely ſo much whilſt they live.
And one Gentleman (leaving two ſonnes of tender age)
<pb facs="tcp:172419:9"/>
having appointed by his Will, in caſe they dye without iſſue,
that an eſtate of two hundred pound <hi>per annum,</hi> ſhould be

            <p>3. That God hath wrought a reſolution in us of the
Corporation (wherein wee truſt hee will inable us to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt)
(<hi>viz.</hi>) to contribute our labour and paines freely to
this worke, without the leaſt diminution of the Stocke.
And if any deſire to be ſatisfied what our receipts, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſements,

and how imployed or improved.</p>
            <p>'Tis very ſtrange to ſee what a multitude of objections
are darted againſt this pure piece of Chriſtianitie, yea by
ſome, whom otherwiſe wee have charitable thoughts of, and
bow exceedingly the worke is impeded thereby, and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
through mercy wee are able to anſwer every one of them
ſufficiently, yet wee forbeare to particularize them, leaſt
wee ſhould refleſh too much on ſome, our Conſciences telling
us, that as the worke is of God, and really ſuch as is held
forth, ſo he onely can ſatisfie the ſpirits of Men, and will
doe it in due ſeaſon, and in the meane time bleſſe his owne
worke being able to carry it on, who delighteth oft times in

thought it my duty not to omit it, that ſo

eſpecially your ſelfe, with the reſt of the

the progreſſe and preſent ſtate of this
worke of the Lord among the <hi>Indians,</hi> for wee meete with
changes of providence and tryalls in this our day of ſmall
things. It hath pleaſed the Lord to try them, ſo ſoone as
they have but taſted of his holy wayes. For our natures can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
live without Phyſicke, nor grace without affliction, more
or leſſe, ſooner or later. The winter before this laſt paſt it
pleaſed God to worke wonderfully for the <hi>Indians,</hi> who call
upon God in preſerving them from the ſmall Pox, when their
prophane Neighbours were cut off by it. This winter it hath
pleaſed God to make leſſe difference, for ſome of ours were
alſo viſited with that diſeaſe, yet this the Lord hath done
for them, that fewer of them have dyed thereof, then of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
who call not upon the Lord. Onely three dyed of it,
(but five more young and old) of other diſeaſes: Now
(through the Lords mercy) they are well, though not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ordinary infirmities, which befall Mankinde. In mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Religion they goe on, nor onely in attendance on
ſuch meanes as they have, not onely in knowledge, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth

both in conſtant care in attendance on the worſhip of God on
Sabbath dayes and Lecture-dayes, eſpecially profitting in the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:172419:11"/>
gift of prayer, and alſo in the exerciſe of love to ſuch as be in
affliction, either by ſickneſſe or povertie. I have ſeene lively
Actings of Charitie out of Reverence to the Command o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Lord, when ſuch as had not that principle were farre
from ſuch workes of mercy, it pleaſed God to try them in the
time of the Pox, for ſome of them did hazard their owne
lives (for to them it is very mortall) in obedience to the
Command of the Lord, to ſhew mercy to them that were
ſicke, and ſome were infected thereby, and fell ſicke and lay
with much chearefullneſſe and patience under Gods hand,
and through the Lords mercy are well againe; others who
did ſhew mercy in that caſe eſcaped the ſickneſſe to the praiſe
of God. Likewiſe God is pleaſed to try their Charitie by an
old Paraliticke or Palſie ſick-man, whoſe owne Children
being prophane and tyred with the burthen of him (his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive
power of houlding excrements being looſened) and
having a looſeneſſe, ſometimes he is very noyſome and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenſome)
they forſooke him, and he had periſhed, but that
the Lord ſtirred up (by the word of his grace) their hearts to
ſhew mercy to him, for he was while he was ſicke at ſix ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
a weeke charge, for wee offered twelve-pence a night to
any to tend him, and for meere hyre none would abide it, but
out of mercy and Charitie ſome of the Families did take care
of him, and gave freely ſome weeks, and others were payd
out of their publique money, namely, ſuch as hath been taken
off, ſuch as have been Tranſgreſſors by Fine or Mulct: and
ſtill he is at foure ſhillings a weeke charge being better in
health, in ſo much that all their publique money is ſpent,
and much more, and wee have Collections among them for
the ſame uſe. The old man who hath been and ſtill is wiſe,
doth wiſely teſtifie that their love is ſincere, and that they
truely pray to God, and I hope ſo doth he, and ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
I could with a word ſpeaking in our Churches have this
poore man relived, but I doe not, becauſe I thinke the Lord
hath done it, for the tryall of their grace, and exerciſe of
their love, and to traine them up in works of Charitie, and
in the way of Chriſt to make Collections for the poore. I ſee
how the Lord provideth to further the progreſſe of the Goſpel,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:172419:11"/>
by theſe tryalls and afflictions, yea there be more paſſages of
this winters worke, wherein the Lord hath taught us by the
Croſſe. For one of our firſt and principall men is dead, which
though it be a great blow and damping to our worke in ſome
Reſpects, yet the Lord hath not left the reſt to diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
thereby, nay the worke is greatly furthered, for hee
made ſo gracious an end of his life, and imbraced death with
ſuch holy ſubmiſſion to the Lord, and was ſo little terrified
at it, as that it hath greatly ſtrengthened the Faith of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to be conſtant, and not to feare death, greatly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
of the death of <hi>Wamporas,</hi> for that was his name, I
thinke he did more good by his death, then he could have
done by his life: one of his ſayings was, That God giveth us
three mercies in this world; the firſt is health and ſtrength;
the ſecond is food and cloaths; the third is ſickneſſe and
death; and when wee have had our ſhare in the two firſt, why
ſhould wee not be willing to take our part in the third? for
his part he was: I heard him ſpeake thus, and at other times
alſo, and at his laſt he ſo ſpake, and it ſo tooke with them,
that I obſerve it in their prayers, that they ſo reckon up
Gods diſpenſations to them, his laſt words which he ſpake
in this world were theſe; <hi>Jehova Aninnumah Jeſus Chriſt,</hi>
(that is) Oh, Lord, give mee Jeſus Chriſt; and when hee
could ſpeake no more, he continued to lift up his hands to
Heaven, according as his ſtrength laſted, unto his laſt breath;
ſo that they ſay of him he dyed praying; when I viſited him
the laſt time that I ſaw him in this world (not doubting but I
ſhall ſee him againe with Chriſt in Glory) one of his ſayings
was this: Foure yeares and a Quarter ſince, I came to your
houſe, and brought ſome of our Children to dwell with the
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> now I dye, I ſtrongly intreate you (for that is their
phraſe) that you would ſtrongly intreate Elder <hi>Heath</hi> (with
whom his Sonne liveth) and the reſt, which have our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
that they may be taught to know God, ſo as that they
may teach their Countrymen, becauſe ſuch an example would
doe great good among them, his heart was much upon our
intended worke, to gather a Church among them, I told him
I greatly deſired that he might live (if it were Gods will) to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:172419:12"/>
be one in that worke, but if he ſhould now dye he ſhould
goe to a better Church, where <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi>
and <hi>Moſes,</hi> and all the dead Saints were with Jeſus Chriſt in
the preſence of God in all happineſſe and Glory; he ſaid he
feared not death, he was willing to dye, and turning to the
Company which were preſent, hee ſpake unto them thus;
<hi>I now ſhall dye, but Jeſus Chriſt calleth you that live to goe to</hi>
Naticke, <hi>that there the Lord might rule over you, that you
might make a Church, and have the Ordinance of God among
you, believe in his Word, and doe as hee commandeth you:</hi>
With many ſuch words exhorting them, which they could
not heare without weeping. A little before his death hee
ſpake many gracious words unto them, wherein one paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
was this; <hi>Some delight to heare and ſpeake idle and foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
words, but I deſire to heare and ſpeake onely the words of
God, exhorting them ſo to doe likewiſe:</hi> his gracious words
were acceptable and affecting, that whereas they uſed to
flie and avoyde with terrour ſuch as lye dying, now on
the contrary they flocked together to heare his dying
words, whoſe death and buriall they beheld with many
teares; nor am I able to write his Storie without weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>Another affliction and damping to our worke was this,
that it hath pleaſed God to take away that <hi>Indian</hi> who was
moſt active in Carpentrey, and who had framed me an houſe
with a little direction of ſome <hi>Engliſh,</hi> whom I ſometime pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
to goe with mee to guide him, and to ſet out his worke:
hee dyed of the Pox this winter, ſo that our houſe lyeth, not
yet raiſed, which maketh my aboade amongſt them more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult,
and my tarriance ſhorter then elſe I would, but the
Lord helpeth me to remember that he hath ſaid, <hi>Endure thou
hardneſſe as a good Souldier of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Theſe are ſome of
the gracious tryalls and Corrections the Lord hath exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
us withall, yet he hath mingled them with much love and
favour in other reſpects; for it hath pleaſed God this win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
much to inlarge the abilitie of him whoſe helpe I uſe in
tranſlating the Scriptures, which I account a great further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of that which I moſt deſire, namely, to communicate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:172419:12"/>
to them as much of the Scriptures in their owne language as I
am able. Beſides, it hath pleaſed God to ſtirre up the hearts of
many of them this winter to learne to reade and write, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they doe very much profit with a very little helpe, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſome of them, for they are very ingenuous. And whereas
I had thoughts that vvee muſt have an <hi>Engliſhman</hi> to be their
Schoole-Maſter, I now hope that the Lord will raiſe up ſome
of themſelves, and enable them unto that worke, with my care
to teach them well in the reaſon of the ſounds of Letters and
ſpelling, I truſt in the Lord that vvee ſhall have ſundry of them
able to reade and write, who ſhall vvrite every man for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
ſo much of the Bible as the Lord ſhall pleaſe to enable me
to tranſlate. Beſides thoſe workes which concerne Religion
and Learning, wee are alſo a doing (according to the meaſure
of our day of ſmall things) in the civill part of this worke
wee have ſet out ſome part of the Towne in ſeverall Streets,
meaſuring out and dividing of Lots, which I ſet them to doe
and teach them how to doe it: many have planted Apple-Trees,
and they have begun diverſe Orchards, its now plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-time,
and they be full of buſineſſe, yet wee are doing ſome
publicke workes; the laſt weeke I appointed our Lecture to
be at a Water which is common paſſage, and where the Fiſh
wee call <hi>Alewives</hi> come, there wee built a bridge, and made a
wyre to catch Fiſh, and being many of them, ſome wee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to one worke, and ſome to another, through the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of God wee brought both theſe workes to perfection:
wee alſo have begun a Pallizadoe Fort, in the midſt where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
wee intend a meeting-houſe and Schoole-houſe, but
wee are in great want of Tooles, and many neceſſaries, and
when wee cannot goe wee muſt be content to creepe; this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
weeke I am going to <hi>Pawtueket,</hi> the great Fiſhing place
upon <hi>Merimek,</hi> where I heare ſundry doe expect my coming,
with a purpoſe to ſubmit themſelves unto the Lords hand.
Sir, I doe earneſtly beg your prayers both for mee and for
this worke of the Lord which he hath ſet mee about,</p>

is a great meanes to quicken the heart to be conſtant in

It is my duty to let you underſtand how it pleaſeth the Lord

for the promoting vvhereof you travaile with care and

                     <hi>Winſlowe,</hi> ſo farre as I can call to minde
vvhat I wrote, hoping in the Lord that the Ships are ſafely ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived,
and my Letters come unto his hands. I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I have yet mentioned our Schoole, vvhich through the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:172419:13"/>
Lords mercy vvee have begun, though vvee cannot yet be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
in it, vvee have two men in ſome meaſure able to teach
the youth vvith my guidance, and inſpection. And thus vvee
order the Schoole: The Maſter daily prayeth among his
Schollers, and inſtructeth them in Catechiſme, for which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
I have compiled a ſhort Catechiſme, and vvrote it in the
Maſters booke, vvhich he can reade, and teach them; and alſo
all the Copies he ſetteth his Schollers vvhen he teacheth them
to write, are the Queſtions and Anſwers of the Catechiſme,
that ſo the Children may be the more prompt and ready there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in:
wee aſpire to no higher learning yet, but to ſpell, reade,
and vvrite, that ſo they may be able to vvrite for themſelves
ſuch Scriptures as I have already, or hereafter may (by the
bleſſing of God) tranſlate for them; for I have no hope to
ſee the Bible tranſlated, much leſſe printed in my dayes.
Therefore my chiefe care is to Communicate as much of the
Scriptures as I can by vvriting: and further, my ſcope ſo to
traine up both men and youths, that when they be in ſome
meaſure inſtructed themſelves, they may be ſent forth to other
parts of the Countrey, to traine up and inſtruct others, even
as they themſelves have been trained up and inſtructed. This
conſideration doth make mee very carefull to put on the
Schoole, and attend it with what diligence I can, although I
cannot as yet doe in it, what I deſire. There be ſeverall provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
of God appearing to worke, which make mee thinke
that the moſt effectuall and generall way of ſpreading the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
will be by themſelves, when ſo inſtructed as I have above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned;
as for my preaching, though ſuch whoſe hearts
God hath bowed to attend, can picke up ſome knowledge by
my broken expreſſions, yet I ſee that it is not ſo taking, and
effectuall to ſtrangers, as their owne expreſſions be, who natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
ſpeake unto them in their owne tongue. To the end
therefore that they may be the better able to teach others,
I doe traine them up, and exerciſe them therein: vvhen I am
among them on the Lords dayes, appointing two, each Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both
to exerciſe, and when they have done, then I proceed,
and aſſuredly I finde a good meaſure of abilitie in them, not
onely in prayer (wherein they exceed my expectation) but
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:172419:14"/>
in memory to rehearſe ſuch Scriptures as I have read unto
them and expounded; to expound them alſo as they have
heard mee doe, and apply them. And now alſo the Schoole-Maſter
taking the care of catechizing the Children, I leaving
that to him doe catechize the men, examining and trying their
knowledge, which yet I am wary in doing, leaſt I ſhould
dampe and diſcourage the weake. Theſe things I attend with
the more intention, becauſe it ſeemeth to mee God will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
theſe firſt inſtructed to inſtruct others, of which I have
had ſundry experiences, ſome I ſhall inſtance; it pleaſed M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
                     <hi>Winthrop</hi> (ſon unto our late Honoured Governour now at reſt)
to adviſe mee to ſend two diſcreete men to the greateſt and
moſt potent <hi>Sachem</hi> among the <hi>Naraganſets,</hi> to anſwer ſuch
Queſtions as they might propound, and to ſtirre them up to
call on God. I did accordingly, and ſent him a Preſent by
them; but the proud <hi>Sachem</hi> did little leſſe then deſpiſe the
offer, though hee tooke the Preſent; So they thought they
ſhould have returned without ſucceſſe; but when they came
among the people, eſpecially ſuch as were a little more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
from the great and proud ones, they received them with
great gladneſſe; one Company taking one of ours among
them, others taking the other of our men amongſt them;
they asked them many Queſtions, expreſſed their readineſſe to
call upon God, if they had any to teach them: expreſſing like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
that they did not expect their <hi>Sachems</hi> would pray to God,
becauſe they vvere ſo proud: by which I doe perceive that the
Lord is preparing a plentifull harveſt, and not onely by this,
but by many other Evidences. There is a great Countrey ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
betweene <hi>Conectacott</hi> and the <hi>Maſſachuſets,</hi> called <hi>Nipnet,</hi>
where there be many <hi>Indians</hi> diſperſed, many of which have
ſent to our <hi>Indians,</hi> deſiring that ſome may be ſent unto them
to teach them to pray unto God. And ſometimes ſome of our
beſt men doe goe to ſeverall places for a little while, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
againe, and not without ſucceſſe. Theſe things being
ſo, the worke which vvee now have in hand will be as a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne
and Copie before them, to imitate in all the Countrey,
both in civilizing them in their order, government, Law,
and in their Church proceedings and adminiſtrations; and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:172419:14"/>
hence great care lyeth upon mee to ſet them right at firſt, to
lay a ſure foundation for ſuch a building, as I foreſee will be
built upon it, and in this matter I greatly need pray: The or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of proceeding with them, is firſt to gather them together
from their ſcattered courſe of life, to cohabitation and civill
order and Government, and then to forme them (the Lord
having fitted them) into viſible Church-ſtate, for the gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
whereof, I have inſtructed them, that they ſhould looke
onely into the Scriptures, and out of the word of God fetch
all their Wiſedome, Lawes, and Government, and ſo ſhall they
be the Lords people, and the Lord above ſhall Reigne over
them, and governe them in all things by the word of his
mouth. Sundry of theſe which pray unto God have formerly
ſubjected themſelves unto the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> So that in this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
among themſelves they doe reſerve themſelves in that
poynt to owne them as their ſuperiours, to make appeales
unto them as neede may require, and experience for theſe
many yeares ſhew, that though they have ſo ſubjected them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
yet the onely benefit they have is protection: as for
hearing and determining their cauſes, the difference of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
and paucitie of Intepreters prohibits, and if their cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
come, they be ſo longſome, and yet of ſmall importance,
that it is of neceſſitie, that either they muſt have no govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as hitherto it hath been, or elſe they muſt have it among
themſelves. Beſides, all or many of their differences and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
they uſually brought to mee, which was not convenient,
and I was willing to avoyde: themſelves alſo found great
need that ſome ſhould be over them, to judge their cauſes, and
end differences, and much deſired it. Therefore upon the ſixt
day of the ſixt Moneth of this preſent yeare (their Pallizadoe
Fort being finiſhed) they had a great meeting, and many came
together from diverſe parts, though ſundry were hindred and
came not at that time, where, with prayer to God I read and
expounded to them the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Exodus,</hi> (which I had done
ſeverall times before) and finally they did ſolemnly chooſe
two Rulers among themſelves, they firſt choſe a Ruler of an
Hundred, then they choſe two Rulers of Fifties, then they
choſe Ten or Tithing Men (ſo I call them in <hi>Engliſh</hi>) for ſo
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:172419:15"/>
they were called (as is reported) in <hi>England,</hi> vvhen <hi>England</hi>
did flouriſh happily under that kinde of Government. And
laſtly, for that dayes worke every man choſe who ſhould be
his Ruler of ten, the Rulers ſtanding in order, and every man
going to the man he choſe, and it ſeemed unto mee as if I had
ſeene ſcattered bones goe, bone unto his bone, and ſo lived a
civill politicall life, and the Lord was pleaſed to miniſter no
ſmall comfort unto my ſpirit, when I ſaw it. After this worke
was ended, they did enter into Covenant with God, and each
other, to be the Lords people, and to be governed bythe word
of the Lord in all things. The words of which Covenant are
theſe in <hi>Engliſh. Wee doe give our ſelves and our Children unto God
to be his people, Hee ſhall rule us in all our affaires, not onely in our
Religion, and affaires of the Church (theſe wee deſire as ſoone as wee
can, if God will) but alſo in all our workes and affaires in this world,
God ſhall rule over us.</hi> Iſa. 33. 22. <hi>The Lord is our Judge, the Lord
is our Law-giver, the Lord is our King, Hee will ſave us; the Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
which God hath taught us in his Booke, that ſhall guide us and
direct us in the way. Oh Jehovah, teach us wiſedome to finde out thy
wiſedome in thy Scriptures, let the grace of Chriſt helpe us, becauſe
Chriſt is the wiſedome of God, ſend thy Spirit into our hearts, and let
it teach us, Lord take us to be thy people, and let us take thee to be our
God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Act of forming themſelves into the Government of
God, and entring into this Government is the firſt publique
Record among the <hi>Indians,</hi> and for ought I know the firſt that
ever was among them: and now our next worke is to prepare
them for Church-eſtate, to which end I doe inſtruct them, that
the Viſible Church of Chriſt is builded upon a lively confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Chriſt, and Covenanting to walke in all the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations
of the publique worſhip of God, under the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Diſcipline of Jeſus Chriſt. I doe therefore exhort
them to try their hearts by the word of God to finde out what
change the Lord hath wrought in their hearts, and this is the
preſent vvorke vvee have in hand.</p>
                  <p>Give mee leave (much honoured Friends) to goe a little
backe in my relation, that I might be more particular, becauſe
theſe Letters I prepared in the ſixt Moneth after they had cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:172419:15"/>
their Officers, as I was propounding and teaching them the
above-written Covenant, for that I did often before wee did
ſolemnely accompliſh it, that ſo they might doe it as an Act of
knowledge and faith. Now let mee relate the order of our
proceeding: Having againe and againe read this Covenant to
them, and inſtructed them in the meaning of it, it pleaſed God
to wrack M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Webbers</hi> Ship at <hi>Conahaſſet,</hi> though the Lord dealt
favourably; moſt goods were ſaved, though much ſpoyled:
this was on the firſt day of the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Moneth, wherefore at a
Lecture at <hi>Natik</hi> on the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of the ſame Moneth, I informed
them of the plentifull ſupply which the Lord had made your
ſelves his inſtruments to ſend unto them for the furtherance
of this our worke, and alſo how the Lord had frowned upon
it, and undoubtedly it was a fruit of ſinne, and therefore the
Lord called them to repentance, and make peace with God:
beſides wee were beginning a great worke of civill Cohabita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Governement, and they wanted wiſdome to carry on
ſuch a worke, and the Lord had promiſed, <hi>if any want wiſdome
aske it of God, who gives liberally,</hi> citing that of <hi>James</hi> which I had
formerly preached on. Moreover, wee were in preparation
for a Church-ſtate, and that was a great matter to ſeeke the
Lord in; and laſtly, they having choſen Rulers, and intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to enter into a Covenant, to promiſe unto God to be his
people, and to be ruled in all things by his Word. Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
is that ſuch a Covenant ſhould be entred into, in a
ſolemne day of faſting and prayer, and all theſe cauſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred,
to put us on unto that worke. Now though wee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
yet had kept ſuch a day unto the Lord, yet I had inſtructed
them therein, for in the Spring wee had a generall day of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation
in all the Churches; and thereupon they moved this
queſtion; <hi>Why the Engliſh often faſted and prayed, and I never yet
taught them ſo to doe:</hi> to which I did anſwer, by that of Chriſt
unto the Diſciples, but told them, that when wee ſet upon
the great vvorkes of God to be his people, governed by his
Word, and to gather a Church, then they ſhould be called of
God unto it, &amp;c. and now it came to paſſe, my motion they
deliberated on with ſome conference (as their manner is) and
finally did conſent unto it, then I told them, it was needfull
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:172419:16"/>
they ſhould pray and teach that day; ſundry of them and wee
agreed, that all ſuch as vvere called to be Rulers ſhould exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
that day, or ſo many as wee had time for their exerciſe.
Before that day came, even then when it was appointed <hi>Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamoquin,</hi>
the chiefe <hi>Sachem,</hi> and therefore choſen the chiefe
(for hee is conſtant in his profeſſion, though doubtfull in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of the throughneſſe of his heart) was in the Countrey
neere <hi>Narragan ſet,</hi> about appeaſing ſome ſtrife among ſome <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chems.</hi>
In which Journey ſome of thoſe bad <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamoquin</hi>
with them did buy much ſtrong Water at <hi>Gortons</hi>
Plantation, and had a great drinking, from which the wiſer
ſort did withdraw themſelves, but <hi>Cutſhamoquin</hi> was in it,
though not unto drunkenneſſe, yet his Act was ſcandalous.
Before vvee ſolemnly appeared before God, and made the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-written
Covenant, I adviſed with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Cotton</hi> about it,
and his Counſaile was to add theſe words in the beginning:
<hi>Wee are the ſonnes of Adam, wee and our forefathers have a long
time been loſt in our ſinnes, but now the mercy of the Lord beginneth
to finde us out againe; therefore the grace of Chriſt helping us, wee doe
give our ſelves and our Children, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When the day came, this Act of <hi>Cutſhamoquin</hi> being broken
out, wee ſuffered not him to teach; onely he began the day
with confeſſion of his ſinne, and made a ſhort prayer, wherein
he confeſſed, Satan acted in his heart, begged pardon, and that
the Spirit of God might dwell in him, and act in him for time
to come, and ſo ended.</p>
                  <p>Then another of them began with prayer, and for his Text
tooke that in the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Luke</hi> 36. to the end, (though they doe
not know the Booke, Chapter, or Verſe, but diſtinguiſh my
Lectures by the firſt materiall word in it) <hi>Chriſt being invited by
Symon the Phariſee, the Woman waſht his feete with her teares, &amp;c.</hi>
At vvhich <hi>Symon</hi> ſtumbling, Chriſt ſpake the parable of the
two Debtors, both freely forgiven, with the application, all
which he repeated pretty well, and after his teaching he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
againe and ended. The ſecond tooke for his Text the <hi>Lords
Prayer,</hi> becauſe it is, ſaid he, a day of prayer. The third tooke
for his Text the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Matthew</hi> 19. to the end, <hi>Every tree that
bringeth not forth good fruit is cut downe, &amp;c.</hi> And upon that pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:172419:16"/>
of the two Builders, on the rocke the firſt, the other on
the ſand, &amp;c. By this time the day was well up, then I taught
out of the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Ezra</hi> 3. &amp; 9. where I deſcribed a day of faſting,
and the right carriage of it; yet by the parable of a Nut, I ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that outward acts are as the ſhell, which is neceſſary, but a
broken and believing heart is the kernell, and ſo ended the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
of the day. After a little reſpite (in which time a Queſtion
came to mee, if it were lawfull to take a pipe of Tobacco?) we
met againe, the firſt took his Text, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16. 22. and his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
was, <hi>I reade or rehearſe this, and let every one reade it in his
owne heart.</hi> The ſecond took his Text, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 24. to 31.
from the parable of him that <hi>ſowed good ſeed, and the enemie came
and while they ſlept ſowed tares,</hi> &amp;c. The third took his Text,
<hi>Luke</hi> 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. 4, 5, 6. ver. <hi>Prepare yee the way of the Lord, make his
paths ſtraight,</hi> &amp;c. By this time night drew on, then I took for
my Text, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. and the 1. to 16. where <hi>Iſrael</hi> entred into
Covenant with the Lord: and finally our Covenant in the
forerecited words I expreſſed, and they joyntly conſented un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to;
firſt the Rulers, then all the people, then was the Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
for the poore, and by dark night wee finiſhed our worke.
Thus have I briefly deſcribed that bleſſed day wherein theſe
poore ſoules ſolemnely became the people of the Lord: this
was on the 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Moneth, 1651.</p>
                  <p>Upon the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of the <hi>Oct.</hi> Moneth, which was our next Lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
(for it is in that place but once in a fortnight, I houlding
a Lecture each other weeke ſtill at any other place) it pleaſed
our Governour with many others attending him, to viſit our
poore workes and day of ſmall things, where they viewed our
houſe, our Fort, our Bridge, adviſed about a place for a Mill,
&amp;c.) At the ſeaſon they came unto our Lecture, and obſerved
the carriage and behaviour of things and men: among other
things one of our <hi>Indians</hi> did (as we are wont) exerciſe, which
they tooke ſo much notice of, and were ſo farre affected with,
as that it pleaſed the Governour to advice me to write the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of that which he ſpake, which is as followeth; his Text
was <hi>Matth. 13. 44, 45, 46. Againe, the Kingdome of heaven is like
vnto treaſure hid in a feild, the which when a man hath found, he hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
and for joy thereof goeth and ſelleth all that he hath, and buyeth
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:172419:17"/>
the feild: 45. Againe, the Kingdome of heaven is like unto a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant-man
ſeeking goodly pearles: 46. Who when he had found one
pearle of great price, he went and ſould all that he had and bought it.</hi>
The ſubſtance of theſe words he did twice rehearſe, then for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
he firſt propounded what is this treaſure which is hid
in a feild? he anſwered it is Repentance for ſinne, faith in
Chriſt, and pardon of ſinne and all grace, as alſo praying to
God, the worſhip of God, and his appointments, which are
the meanes of Grace, on which he dilated, ſhewing what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
pearles theſe are, exhorting all to account ſo of them,
and on this point he did much inſiſt: ſecondly, he asked what
is the Feild where theſe pearles are to be found? he anſwered
the Church of Chriſt, which they did deſire to conſtitute in this
place, and to that end come thither to dwell: Thirdly, he
asked what is it to ſell all that a man hath to buy this Feild?
He anſwered, to part with all their ſinnes, and to part with all
their old Cuſtomes, and to part with their friends and lands,
or any thing which hindereth them from coming to that place,
where they may gather a Church, and enjoy all theſe pearles;
and here he inſiſted much to ſtirre them up, that nothing ſhould
hinder them from Gathering together into this place where
they might enjoy ſuch a mercy.</p>
                  <p>Then he proceeded to the ſecond parable, and his firſt Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
was, Who is the Marchant man, that ſeeketh goodly
pearles? he anſwered, it is all you <hi>Indians</hi> which pray to God,
and repent of ſinne, and come to heare the word of God, you
come to ſeeke for excellent pearles; and here alſo he inſiſted:
his ſecond Queſtion was, What is this pearle of great price?
now in anſwer to this Queſtion he did not pitch it on Chriſt
alone, and ſhew the worth and price of Chriſt: but he did
pitch it on faith in Jeſus Chriſt, and repentance for ſinne, and
ſtood upon the excellency and neceſſitie thereof. And this was
the greateſt defect I obſerved in his Exerciſe, which ſeeing I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
take to relate that which none but my ſelfe underſtood, I
dare not but truely relate, becauſe the Lord heard all, and I
muſt give an account of this relation before him: His next que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
was, What is meant by all the Riches he had? he anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
his ſinnes, his evill Cuſtomes, his evill manners, in which
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:172419:17"/>
he formerly tooke much pleaſure; And here he dilated alſo:
Laſtly he asked how did he ſell them all, and buy the pearle?
he anſwered, by caſting away &amp; forſaking all his ſinnes, mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and repenting of them, praying to God, and believing in
Jeſus Chriſt. And here he fervently dilated, and ſo ended;
and this according to the beſt of my memory and obſervation,
is the ſubſtance of what he delivered. Whereby you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the manner of my teaching them, for they imitate mee,
as for our method of preaching to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> by way of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
reaſon, and uſe, neither have I liberty of ſpeech, for that
way of teaching being very unskilfull in their Language, nor
have they ſufficient abilitie of underſtanding to profit by it,
ſo well as by this way, whereof you have herein a little

and ours in the Lord. There was here ſome few weekes ſince,
the prime <hi>Indian</hi> at <hi>Marthas Vineyard</hi> with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Mahewe (Humane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinn)</hi>

who is a great proficient both in knowledge and utterance,
and love, and practice of the things of Chriſt, and of Religion,
much honoured and reverenced, and attended by the reſt of the
<hi>Indians</hi> there, who are ſolemnely Covenanted together, I know
not how many, but between thirtie or fortie at the leaſt, and
receive none into their Fraternitie, or Combination, but thoſe
which give good proofe of their upright deſires, to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,

from the Scripture, ſome two houres together, with ſolemne
prayer before and after, and then ended with a <hi>Pſalme,</hi> ſuch as
at home is wont to be ſung among his uſuall hearers. The
Lords day after he was in our Aſſembly, the Boate then being
ready to carry him home by the next opportunitie, and truely
my reverence to him was ſuch, as there being no roome I pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
our brethren to receive that good <hi>Indian</hi> into one of their
pewes, which they did forenoone and afternoone, and at meale,
I perceived by him that he had underſtanding of what he heard.
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Leverich</hi> being lately here and at my houſe, (who alſo prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched

and progreſſe of the Lords worke, among his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
<hi>Indians</hi> at <hi>Sandwich,</hi> and did heare from him, what did
my heart good. And therefore when he tooke his leave of me
I requeſted him that he would doe me the favour at his returne
home, to ſend me a briefe ſtory of that good hand of God
which was there upon them, <hi>ab origine,</hi> which I thanke him he
did ſoone after, and I thought not amiſſe to incloſe it, as it
came to me, being written with his own hand, not doubting
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:172419:18"/>
but it would adde unto your rejoycing in the Lord. About a
fortnight ſince, there was a Lecture to be of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Eliot,</hi> at <hi>Naticke,</hi>
the new <hi>Indian</hi> Towne, where he uſeth frequently to preach to

then to be there, my Coſin <hi>Rawſon</hi> and I with ſome other,
did prepare to ride thither, the Governour and his Sergeants
lying at <hi>Dedham,</hi> which is within ſeaven or eight miles of the
Towne, and we at M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Jackſons</hi> neere <hi>Watertowne</hi> Mill) in like

there where we found M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Eliot,</hi> and by that time we had view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all things, the Governour came with about twentie horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
from <hi>Dedham,</hi> and made a like view, after which the Lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
or Sermon began in the Fort, which the <hi>Indians</hi> have made
of whole trees very hanſome and firme, which is neere a faire
houſe which the <hi>Indians</hi> have built after the <hi>Engliſh</hi> manner
high and large (no <hi>Engliſh</hi>-mans hand in it, ſave that one day
or two they had an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Carpenter with them to direct a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the time of rearing, with chimneys in it: In which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liot</hi>
&amp; thoſe which accompany him uſe to lye, and the <hi>Indian</hi>
Schoole-Maſter was there teaching the Children who doth
reade and ſpell very well himſelfe, and teacheth them to doe
the like (beſides writing) and as there is a large Roome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
ſo there is a like chamber above, in a Corner whereof M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
                     <hi>Eliot</hi> hath a little Roome incloſed, and a bed &amp; bed-ſted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
and in the ſame Chamber the <hi>Indians</hi> doe as in a Wardrope
hang up their skinnes, and things of price, as counting them
there to be very ſafe, as well when the dores be open, as when
they be locked; they have laid out three long faire ſtreets there,
two on this ſide the River, and one on that, and have ſeverall
houſe-lots apportioned ſeverally to every one, which doe or
be to inhabite there, and in many of them there are fruit-trees
already planted, and they are building <hi>Engliſh</hi> houſes for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
meane while living in <hi>Wigwams,</hi> whereof there is good
ſtore neere the hill ſide, at preſent there being a goodly plaine
from the Towne towards <hi>Dedham</hi>) over the River (that is,
<hi>Charles</hi> River) they have made a firme high foote-bridge arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:172419:19"/>
to walks to and fro, having heaped on the bottome tym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
huge ſtones, the more to fortifie it, and it was a great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to them, that the laſt yeare, (when a like bridge
made by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in the new <hi>Dedham</hi> Village called <hi>Medefield,</hi>
ſome foure or five miles from them) was throwne downe by
the force of the flouds or Ice, yet theirs did ſtand firme and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right.
But to returne to the Fort, and to the buſines of the
day, that is Round and Capacious, and they have prepared
there a large Canopie of Matts upon poles for M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Eliot</hi> and
the chiefe of his Company to ſit under, and other ſorts for
themſelves and other hearers. The <hi>Saneps</hi> or men by themſelves
and the <hi>Squaes</hi> or women by themſelves, beſides the <hi>Engliſh</hi> then
preſent, (which were about thirtie) there were I thinke not
fewer then a hundred men women and young ones; among the
<hi>Indians</hi> there be ſome greater proficients in knowledge, and of
better utterance by farre then their fellowes, Grave and ſerious
men, whom M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Eliot</hi> hath trained up (or the Lord rather by
his inſtructions and directions) to inſtruct and exhort the reſt
of the <hi>Indians</hi> in their Lords day and other meetings, when he
cannot come to them himſelfe. There be ſome five of theſe,
one of them was prepared before we came, and appointed to
begin this Exerciſe: the further relation of the manner of this
<hi>Indians</hi> behaviour in preaching, together with the ſubſtance of
that Sermon being before ſet downe by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

are here ſupplyed. This man being of middle age, and clad all
in <hi>Engliſh</hi> apparell (as moſt if not all others of them are) ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in the midſt, on a ſtoole, under the ſhelter, did begin with
prayer very ſolemnely, ſtanding up for ſome halfe quarter of an
houre, then ſitting downe ſpake unto them of the two Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
concerning the Feild wherein the treaſure hid, and the
wiſe Marchant ſelling all for the pearle; wee underſtood him
not (ſave M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Eliot</hi>) excepting now and then a word or two,
he diſcourſed to them ſome three quarters of an houre at the
leaft, with great devotion, gravitie, decency, readines and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
and geſtures very becomming, and ſundry mentions
he made of Jeſus Chriſt, ſpecially in the beginning, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:172419:19"/>
the ending, as if he were the ſcope of all, and the reſt of
the <hi>Indians;</hi> diverſe old men and women, and the younger did
joyne and attend with much Reverence, as if much affected
therewith; then he ended with prayer as he beganne. Then
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Eliot</hi> prayed and preached in the <hi>Indian</hi> Language for ſome
houre more, about coming to Chriſt, and bearing his yoake.
This Text was tranſlated by him from the Scripture into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi>
ſpeaking with much authoritie, and after his latter prayer
the <hi>Indian</hi> Schoole-Maſter read out of his Booke one of the
<hi>Pſalmes</hi> in meeter, line by line, tranſlated by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Eliot</hi> into <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi>
all the men and women, &amp;c. ſinging the ſame together in
one of our ordinary <hi>Engliſh</hi> tunes melodiouſly. I ſhould have
ſaid that after M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Eliots</hi> Sermon there were two or three grave
<hi>Indians</hi> that propounded to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Eliot,</hi> each of them a Queſtion,
very pertinent to the matter he handled about the yoake of
Chriſt, and coming to Chriſt, which he anſwered, interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
unto us both their Queſtions, and the ſumme of his owne
Anſwers. After this the Lord did ſtirre up my heart to make
an Exhortation to the <hi>Indians,</hi> which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Eliot</hi> expounded to
them, and alſo the Governours Speech, which God did ſtirre
him up too unto the ſame purpoſe, declaring our joy to ſee
ſuch beginnings, and warning them of the great danger if they
ſhould decline from what they had already come unto, either
in their knowledge, affection, or Chriſtian practice, incoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
them againſt what might dampe or deterre.</p>
                  <p>Then all of us taking us to our horſes left M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Eliot</hi> and them
together, the Governour and his Company to lye at <hi>Dedham,</hi>
and the reſt of us when wee had rid two or three miles with
them did returne into our owne way towards our former lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging,
having been every one of us much refreſhed in our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
in what we ſaw, &amp; were informed of, <hi>viz.</hi> of God amongſt
them. Not long before this, travelling with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Eliots</hi> brother
I conferred in the way ſeriouſly with him about theſe <hi>Indians,</hi>
for he uſeth to accompany his brother, and is a right godly
and diligent man, deſiring to know what ſolidity he found
by experience in them. Who did acquaint mee that there was
difference between them as between the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> ſome being leſſe
ſerious then others, and leſſe ſpirituall; but that there was a
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:172419:20"/>
conſiderable Company of ſolide ones that were conſtant and
forward in good duties, as well on the weeke dayes as on the
Lords. And that he had purpoſely ſometimes in the darke
walked the Round, as it were alone, and found them in their
ſeverall Families as devout in prayer, &amp;c. as if there had been
any preſent to obſerve: and that carried it very modeſtly,
utterly refuſing to receive any reliefe from M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Eliots</hi> Table,
chooſing rather to live on the proviſions at home, which came
in by their owne labour; and when once M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Eliots</hi> owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions
failed (hee being detained among them ſundry dayes
beyond his intent) they ſoone tooke notice, and of their owne
accord did bring unto him varietie of the beſt which they had
themſelves, and he profeſſed unto mee that upon all his beſt
obſervation, there was a very hopefull beginning amongſt them
of the Grace &amp; Kingdome of our Lord Jeſus. The Lord vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe

Secondly, with what ſucceſſe I have hitherto

my weake endeavours. For the firſt of theſe, I
ſuppoſe its not unknowne to your ſelfe, amongſt many others,
what ſingular exerciſe I have had in theſe parts, and what ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Conflicts I have met withall in my travails amongſt our
owne Countreymen, divers of them tranſported with their
(though not ſingular) Fancies, to the rejecting of all Churches
and Ordinances by a new cunning, and I perſwade my ſelfe
one of the laſt but moſt pernicious plot of the Devill to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
all Religion, and introduce all Atheiſme and profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
if it were poſſible, together with which, I have obſerved
a ſpirit of Phariſaiſme and formalitie too, too evidently creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon and ſtrongly poſſeſſing others generally, beſides other
diſcouragements I ſhall forbeare to mention, which conſidered
divers of our brethren, together with my ſelfe, upon conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
had together, were reſolved to moove together elſe whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
where wee might hope for more and better encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as touching our Communion, if God ſo pleaſed: but
were diſſwaded by divers our honoured Friends, both by their
Letters and more private Councells, unto whom we gave way,
at leaſt for the preſent: not long after having an hopefull <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:172419:21"/>
in my houſe, he propounds to mee a motion of teaching the
<hi>Indians</hi> neere us. And ſometime after M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Eliot</hi> invites mee to the
ſame worke by his Letters: then I thought with my ſelfe I muſt
ſtay, and began to taſt the motion with more affection, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
that if God would pleaſe to fit up the roomes of others
with the acceſſe of ſuch forlorne Creatures, and bring in ſuch
as wandred in the high wayes, lanes, and hedges; and Call in
the lame, and hale, and blind, in ſtead of thoſe Contemners,
it would be a mercy; and by no other reſpects in this world
was my breaſt inclined unto this worke, and to attend God in
it. As touching the ſecond, for matter of ſucceſſe and incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement,
I cannot but reckon this one, and that not the leaſt,
that though the <hi>Indian</hi> tongue be very difficult, irregular, and
anomalous, and wherein I cannot meete with a Verbe Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
as yet, nor any ſuch Particles, as Conjunctions, &amp;c. which
are eſſentiall to the ſeverall ſorts of axioms, and conſequently
to all rationall and perfect diſcourſes, and that though their
words are generally very long, even <hi>ſe ſquipe dalia verba,</hi> yet I
finde God helping, not onely my ſelfe to learne and attaine
more of it in a ſhort time, then I thinke I could or did of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,
Greeke, or Hebrew, in the like ſpace of time, when my
memory was ſtronger, &amp; when all known rules of Art are help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to faſten ſuch notions in the minde of the learner; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
the <hi>Indians</hi> to underſtand mee fully (as they acknowledge)
ſo farre as I have gone. I am conſtrained by many ambages and
circumlocutions to ſupply the former defect, to expreſſe my
ſelfe to them as I may. The next encouragement I may not
without ground omit to mention is this, that it pleaſeth God
to helpe ſome of theſe poore Creatures to looke over and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the Examples of ſome of our looſer ſort of <hi>Engliſh,</hi> which
I looke upon as a great ſtumbling blocke to many. It's to be

looſer ſort of <hi>Engliſh,</hi> ſhould be ſo generally polluted by them,
and blaſphemed by Heathens, through the occaſion of their

ſerious in their Inquiries after God, and conſcientious accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their light, and ſuch others that are more ſlight, and
meere pretenders to Religions. Thirdly, for more particular
obſervations. 1. God hath brought ſome of them to a ſence
of their ſinnes, and a feare of his juſtice. Here I ſhall inſert an
example or two, one of them being to repeate ſuch Principles
I had begun to traine them in, in a Catechiſticall way (for my
penury confines mee to this method at preſent, and I hope it
may be never the worſe for them) was a good while before he
could ſpeake, having his countenance ſad before (and as I have
underſtood ſince a weeke together after our former exerciſe)
and in ſpeaking the teares all the while trickling downe his
Cheekes: After being demanded by mee what was the matter
of his ſadneſſe, he anſwers mee, he did now underſtand that
God was a juſt God, and for himſelfe he had been very wicked,
even from a childe. And another, whom I uſed as my Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter
now and then in teaching them, falls ſuddenly and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely
into a bitter paſſion, crying out, and wringing his
hands, out of the like apprehenſion of his Condition, as he
told mee afterwards, and I finde no one of them (daring men)
to ſpeake of their good hearts, but ſome more ſome leſſe ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of the Contrary. Secondly, God hath brought ſome of
them to ſome Evangelicall Conviction, one acknowledging
that though he and others leave their former evills, and ſhould
keepe Gods Commandements, yet without Chriſt they muſt
goe to hell. Thirdly, Two or three of them have complained
of the hardneſſe of their hearts, and are queſtioning of Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
Fourthly, Speaking to them of the mercy of God in
Chriſt, one of them tells publiquely it did him more good
to heare of Chriſt, then to heare of all earthly good things,
I would faine hope for ſeeds of Faith in ſuch. Fifthly, Two of
them I deale withall, particularly for perſonall evills, by name
for the ſinne of Fornication, which they were carried away
into, which my <hi>Indian</hi> acquainting my ſelfe with after our
exerciſe I ſpake unto, ſhewing them the evills of this ſinne,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:172419:22"/>
and aggravating of it by the knowledge they now had of God,
&amp;c. and exhorting them to Repentance, and to ſeeke mercy in
Chriſt; whereupon one of them fell into bitter weeping, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
the other though his heart was ſhut up at preſent, yet
not long after, and with longer continuance ſayd, I have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in others a ſence of temptations, ſpirituall bondage, which
they expreſſed naturally thus; one ſaith that he and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
were all one Souldiers, and this in ſadneſſe of ſpirit and
ſpeech: another laying his hands upon his knees and hammes,
complaines he was as a man tyed in Cords, and prayes to God
to be unlooſed, and in generall they are obſerved divers of
them to pray with much affection, mourning; in ſo much
that they are in this reſpect a wonderment to their Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
who enquired what is the matter, why they doe ſo, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>A fourth encouragement to mee is this, I finde the Devill
beſtirring himſelfe, and betaking of himſelfe to his wonted
practice of ſtirring up oppoſitions againſt this worke by his
Inſtruments, as fearing the ruine of his Kingdome, their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen
manifeſting their hatred, threatning they ſhall not plant,
hunt, &amp;c. as before; yea the Controverſie or enmitie rather
ariſes between Parents and Children, &amp;c. Laſtly, and not long
before I was laſt with you in the Bay upon a ſecond day in the
morning before they went away, there came to me to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of twentie of them, voluntarily profeſſing one by one their
deſire to feare God, promiſing that they would leave their
ſins (ſome intermixing acknowledgements of their ſins and
ignorance: and one that <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> knew ſhee had been
very wicked) hereunto calling <hi>Jehovah</hi> to witnes; and this to
doe all their dayes, as long as they live: ſome bringing their
Children, and cauſing them to make the like profeſſion; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
I was the more ſtirred towards them in my ſpirit
(though I acknowledge I was loath to make an abſolute en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement)
to promiſe them I would endevour to be as help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to them as I could in teaching them: which when I had
done, they gave mee thankes publiquely; and ſince this, they
living ſome ſeaven miles from us, have built a <hi>Wigwam</hi> of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
neere our Towne to receive them when they come on the
Lords dayes; and truely Sir, they are ſo attentive in hearing,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:172419:22"/>
that it grieves me I cannot ſpeake to them as I deſire, they
ſeeming to be hungry, and I wanting bread for them. And
thus Sir, you have a naked Narration of our proceedings,
with the events fallen out by Gods providence within not
many moneths. It is I believe a day of ſmall things, and ſo
lookt at by our <hi>Engliſh</hi> many of them, who ſurely would have
periſhed in their darkneſſe, if all others ſhould have contemned
them as they theſe, I pray God they periſh not in the light,
however I am reſolved to bable to them as I may, conſidering
that out of the mouthes of babes God ordaines praiſe, and
found ſtrength to ſtill the enemie, &amp;c. the beginnings of Gods
great works are often in great obſcuritie, where he appoints
the end to be glorious. Alſo I remember one ſowes and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
reaps, which where ever they be, ſuch as are faithfull ſhall
rejoyce together. I doubt not Sir, of your fervent prayers
(which I doe further beg of you and others that know how to
pitty loſt ones) for my ſelfe and poore <hi>Indians,</hi> that the Lord
will proſper our endeavours this way, and water them with
his abundant bleſſings in Jeſus Chriſt, that the day-ſpring
from on high may viſit ſuch poore ſoules as are in darkneſſe,
and the ſhadow of death, and bring them to life in Jeſus
Chriſt.</p>

been knowne, I ſhall by the helpe of God certifie you how the
Lord hath carried on his own worke with us ſince your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
from us.</p>
                  <p>It pleaſed the Lord who had drawne the <hi>Indians</hi> from the
<hi>Pawwaws</hi> to worſhip himſelfe, whereat the <hi>Pawwaws</hi> were much
diſcontented, yet now to perſwade two of themſelves to run
after thoſe that followed hard after God, deſiring that they
might goe with them in the wayes of that God whoſe name is
<hi>Jehovah;</hi> and they came much convinced of their ſinnes that
they had lived in, and eſpecially of their <hi>Pawwawing,</hi> ſaying, I
throw it from mee with hatred of it, being ſorry that ever I
medled with it. And now I have heard of <hi>Jehovah,</hi> by his helpe
I put it under my feete, and hope to trample it downe in the
duſt with the Devill and <hi>Pawwawnomas</hi> (or imps) I throw it
into the fire, and burne it. Thus they fully made knowne un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all both by word and geſture, and by more ſuch like expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
they then uſed, not onely their indignation againſt it,
but that they would never make uſe of it more. One of them did
then diſcover the bottome of his witchcraft, confeſſing that at
firſt he came to be a <hi>Pawwaw</hi> by Diabolicall Dreames, wherein
he ſaw the Devill in the likeneſſe of foure living Creatures;
one was like a man which he ſaw in the Ayre, and this told
him that he did know all things upon the Iſland, and what was
to be done; and this he ſaid had its reſidence over his whole
body. Another was like a Crow, and did looke out ſharply to
diſcover miſchiefes coming towards him, and had its reſidence
in his head. The third was like to a Pidgeon, and had its place
in his breaſt, and was very cunning about any buſineſſe. The
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:172419:24"/>
fourth was like a Serpent, very ſubtile to doe miſchiefe, and
alſo to doe great cures, and theſe he ſaid were meere Devills,
and ſuch as he had truſted to for ſafetie, and did labour to raiſe
up for the accompliſhment of any thing in his diabolicall
craft, but now he ſaith, that he did deſire that the Lord would
free him from them, and that he did repent in his heart, becauſe
of his ſinne.</p>
                  <p>The other ſaid his Conſcience was much troubled for
his ſinne, and they both deſired the Lord would teach them
his wayes, have mercy upon them, and pardon their ſinnes,
for Jeſus Chriſt his ſake: and truely it did give to us who were
preſent a great occaſion of praiſing the Lord, to ſee thoſe poore
naked ſonnes of <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſlaves to the Devill from their birth
to come toward the Lord as they did, with their joynts ſhak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and their bowells trembling, their ſpirits troubled, and
their voyces with much fervency, uttering words of ſore diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure
againſt ſin and Satan, which they had imbraced from
their Childhood with ſo much delight, accounting it alſo
now their ſinne, that they had not the knowledge of God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that they had ſerved the Devill, the Enemy both
of God and Man.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that they were ſo hurtfull in their lives, and were
alſo thankfull that now through the bleſſing of God they had
an opportunitie to be delivered out of that dangerous Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The <hi>Indians</hi> did all much rejoyce to ſee the <hi>Pawwaws</hi>
turne from their wicked wayes to ſerve the Lord. Not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the <hi>Pawwaws</hi> had forſaken their old way, on a Lecture day
after Exerciſe diverſe <hi>Indians</hi> deſired to become the ſervants of
the Lord, amongſt whom was a <hi>Pawwaw,</hi> called <hi>Tequanonim,</hi>
who was of great eſteeme and very notorious; for he as they
ſaid, and in their ignorance conceived, never did hurt to any,
but alwayes good, endeavouring the good and preſervation
of the <hi>Indians;</hi> whereunto alſo he was accompted by them to be
ſtrongly provided. And as himſelfe ſaid he had been poſſeſſed
from the Crowne of the head to the ſoal of the foote with
<hi>Pawwawnomas,</hi> not onely in the ſhape of living Creatures, as
Fowles, Fiſhes, and creeping things, but Braſſe, Iron, and Stone.
It was therefore the more to be acknowledged the worke of
God, that he ſhould forſake this way, his friends, his gaine, to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:172419:25"/>
follow the Lord, whoſe wayes are ſo deſpiſable in the eyes of
devilliſh minded men. This <hi>Pawwaw</hi> declaring by what meanes
the Lord tooke him off this devilliſh Trade, ſaid that he had
heard ſome things from my Father, who tooke occaſion to
diſcourſe with him about the way of true happineſſe, that he
ſhould never forget, bleſſed be God, his Counſell had ſo good
an effect, as I hope it hath on many others. It pleaſed the Lord
who will have all the gods of the earth to be terrible unto him;
For he meeting <hi>Mumanequem</hi> in the wood by accident, told him
that he was glad he had an opportunitie to ſpeake his minde
unto him, for he had many ſearchings of heart about his
<hi>Pawwawing,</hi> and did thinke it was not a good way, and that
God was angry with him for it; for ſaid he my wife hath been
a long time ſicke, and the more I <hi>Pawwaw</hi> for her, the ſicker ſhe
is; And this doth agree with an obſervation of the <hi>Indians</hi> of
this Iſland, <hi>viz.</hi> that ſince the Word of God hath been taught
unto them in this place, the <hi>Pawwaws</hi> have been much foyled
in their devilliſh taskes, and that inſtead of curing have rather
killed many; but in a word the fruit of this and all other
meanes was a publique manifeſtation of hatred to his former
wayes, wondering he was yet alive who was ſo ſinfull, and
that he deſired to be better, and to believe in Chriſt, for whoſe
ſake onely, he did believe his ſinnes could be pardoned, and
that he did deſire to heare the word of God. This man hereby
hath made thoſe of his own houſe to be his Enemies; his wife,
his children, and moſt of his friends and kindred, who remaine
obſtinate ſtill, whereby he meets with many troubles &amp; temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations:
one of his brethren being very ſicke did earneſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
that he would <hi>Pawwaw</hi> for him, which he refuſed, his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
told him that he might keep it private, but he ſtill refuſed,
telling him that notwithſtanding that, if he ſhould anſwer his
deſire, he ſhould breake his Covenant, and ſinne againſt God;
and therefore would not.</p>
                  <p>There came preſſing in at the ſame time about fiftie <hi>Indians,</hi>
deſiring to joyne with the worſhippers of God in his ſervice.
It would be too long for mee to ſet downe what every one ſaid
before they entred into Covenant, onely this I may not omit,
that all of them came confeſſing their ſinnes, ſome in ſpeciall
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:172419:25"/>
the naughtineſſe of their hearts, others in particular, actuall
ſinnes they had lived in: and alſo they all deſired to be made
better, and to attend unto the Word of God, to that end
looking onely to Chriſt Jeſus for ſalvation. I obſerved alſo
that they generally came in by Families, bringing alſo their
Children with them, ſaying, I have brought my Children too,
I would have my Children ſerve God with us, I deſire that this
ſon and this daughter may worſhip <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and if they could
but ſpeake, their parents would have them ſay ſomething, to
ſhew their willingneſſe to ſerve God: And when the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements
were repeated, they all acknowledged them to be
good, and made choice of <hi>Jehovah</hi> to be their God, promiſing
by his helpe to walke according to his Counſells: And when
they were received by them that were before in this generall
Covenant, it was by lowde voyces giving thankes to God that
they were met together in the wayes of <hi>Jehovah:</hi> this is all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the end of the yeare 1650.</p>
                  <p>And now through the mercy of God there are an hundred
ninetie-nine men, women, and children, that have profeſſed
themſelves to be worſhippers of the great and everliving God.
There are now two meetings kept every Lords day, the one
three miles, the other about Eight miles off my houſe: <hi>Hia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes</hi>
teacheth twice a day at the neareſt, and <hi>Mumanequem</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
at the fartheſt, the laſt day of the weeke they come
unto me to be informed touching the ſubject they are to han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle:
And the Lord doth much aſſiſt them, bleſſed be the name
of the Lord. I have alſo undertaken to keepe by the helpe of
God two Lectures amongſt them, which will be at each once
a fortnight: And I hope it will be by the bleſſing of God very
profitable unto them. This winter I intend, if the Lord will,
to ſet up a Schoole to teach the <hi>Indians</hi> to reade, <hi>viz.</hi> the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and alſo any young men that are willing to learne,
whereof they are very glad. I am alſo endeavouring their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitations
with all convenient ſpeed, that ſo they may be
more helpfull one to another; and alſo the better advantaged
to carry on that worke they have ſet upon to Gods glorie, and

<hi>Pawwawes,</hi> and the fiftie <hi>Indians,</hi> that were admitted to thoſe

by power, or allured by gifts, were ſo ſtrongly carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
thoſe wayes they ſo much loved, to love the way that
nature hates. Let us therefore magnifie the Lord, who alone
doth this, and ſeeke unto him to doe more and more ſtill, that

that hath ſtirred up the hearts of any of the
people of God to be inſtrumentall in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging
of the kingdome of his deare Sonne
here amongſt the Heathen <hi>Indians,</hi> which was
one end of our comming hither, and it is not
fruſtrated. It was propheſied of old, and now begins to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 8. Neither can I but acknowledge the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakeable
goodneſſe of God that gives us favour in the ſight
of our Countrymen to helpe on with ſo large a hand of
bountie, ſo glorious a worke, provoked thereunto by
your worthy ſelves, the chiefe Actors of ſo good a deſigne,
let mee (with leave) ſay confidently, you will never have
cauſe to repent it; For the worke is Gods, and he doth own it,
the labour there hath been yours, and your Maſter will reward
it. I thinke Religion and Conſcience binde mee to ſeeke unto
God for you, and to praiſe him with you, for what is alreadie
begun. The Foundation is layd, and ſuch a one that I verily
believe the gates of Hell ſhall never prevaile againſt. I doubt
not but the building will goe on apace, which I hope will
make glad the hearts of Thouſands. Truely Gentlemen, had
you been eare and eye-witneſſes of what I heard and ſaw on a
Lecture-day amongſt them about three weekes ſince, you could
not but be affected therewith as I was. To ſpeake truely I could
hardly refraine teares for very joy to ſee their diligent attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the word firſt taught by one of the <hi>Indians,</hi> who before his
Exerciſe prayed for the manner devoutly and reverently (the
matter I did not ſo well underſtand) but it was with ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence,
zeale, good affection, and diſtinct utterance, that I
could not but admire it; his prayer was about a quarter of an
houre or more, as wee judged it; then he tooke his Text, and
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Eliot</hi> their Teacher tould us that were <hi>Engliſh</hi> the place,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:172419:27"/>
(there were ſome Miniſters and diverſe other godly men there
that attended mee thither) his Text was in <hi>Matthew</hi> 13. 44, 45,
46. He continued in his Exerciſe full halfe an houre or more
as I judged it, his gravitie and utterance was indeed very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable,
which being done M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Eliot</hi> taught in the <hi>Indian</hi>
tongue about three quarters of an houre as neere as I could
gueſſe; the <hi>Indians,</hi> which were in number men &amp; women neere
about one hundred, ſeemed the moſt of them ſo to attend him
(the men eſpecially) as if they would looſe nothing of what
was taught them, which reflected much upon ſome of our
<hi>Engliſh</hi> hearers. After all there was a <hi>Pſalme</hi> ſung in the <hi>Indian</hi>
tongue, and <hi>Indian</hi> meeter, but to an <hi>Engliſh</hi> tune, read by one
of themſelves, that the reſt might follow, and he read it very
diſtinctly without miſſing a word as we could judge, and the
reſt ſang chearefully, and prettie tuneablie. I rid on purpoſe
thither being diſtant from my dwelling about thirty-eight or
fortie miles, and truely I account it one of the beſt Journeys
I made theſe many yeares. Some few dayes after I deſired M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
                     <hi>Eliot</hi> briefely to write mee the ſubſtance of the <hi>Indians</hi> Exerciſe,
which when he went thither againe, namely, to <hi>Naticke,</hi> where
the <hi>Indians</hi> dwell, and where the <hi>Indian</hi> taught, he read what
he remembred of it firſt to their Schoole-Maſter, who is an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi>
and teacheth them and their Children to write, and I ſaw
him write alſo in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who doth it true and very legible,
and asked him if it were right and he ſaid yea, alſo he read it
unto others, and to the man himſelfe, who alſo owned it.
To tell you of their induſtry and ingenuitie in building of an
houſe after the <hi>Engliſh</hi> manner, the hewing and ſquaring
of their tymber, the ſawing of the boards themſelves, and
making of a Chimney in it, making of their groundſells and
wall-plates, and mortiſing, and letting in the ſtudds into them
artificially, there being but one <hi>Engliſh</hi>-man a Carpenter to
ſhew them, being but two dayes with them, is remarkeable.
They have alſo built a Fort there with halfe trees cleft about
eight or ten Inches over, about ten or twelve foote high, beſides
what is intrencht in the ground, which is above a quarter of
an acre of ground, as I judge. They have alſo built a foote
bridge over <hi>Charles</hi> River, with Groundſells and Spurres to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:172419:27"/>
uphold it againſt the ſtrength of the Flood and Ice in the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
it ſtood firme laſt Winter, and I thinke it will ſtand many
Winters. They have made Drummes of their owne with heads
and braſes very neatly and artificially, all which ſhewes they
are induſtrious and ingenuous. And they intend to build a
Water-Mill the next Sommer, as I was tould when I was with
them. Some of them have learnt to mow Graſſe very well.
I ſhall no further trouble you with any more relation at this
time concerning them. But a word or two further with your
patience concerning other <hi>Indians.</hi> The worke of God amongſt
the <hi>Indians</hi> at <hi>Martins Vineyard,</hi> is very hopefull and proſperous
alſo. I miſt of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Mayhew</hi> their Teacher, who was lately at
<hi>Boſton,</hi> and therefore cannot give you a particular account
thereof at this preſent time; yet I cannot but acquaint you
what other motions there are touching other <hi>Indians.</hi> There
came to us upon the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of this inſtant Moneth, at the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Court one <hi>Pummakummin</hi> Sachem of <hi>Qunnubbágge,</hi> dwelling
amongſt or neere to the <hi>Narraganſets,</hi> who offered himſelfe and
his Men to worſhip God, and deſired that ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> may
be ſent from the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> Government to plant his River,
that thereby he may be partaker of Government, and may be
inſtructed by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to know God. Wee ſhall I hope take
ſome care and courſe about it, and I hope wee ſhall have more
helpe to carry on that worke alſo; For there are ſome Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
amongſt us who addict themſelves to the ſtudy of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi>
Tongue. The Lord in mercy recompence it into your
Boſomes, all that labour of love vouchſafed to the poore <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi>
which are the hearty prayers and earneſt deſire of; much

them up thereby to contribute more freely towards the carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the ſame: The reaſon wherefore we have publiſhed ſo
many teſtimonialls, and ſhall inſert more, is becauſe too many
that come from thence labour to blaſt the worke, by reporting
here that there is no ſuch worke a foote in the Countrey: or if
it be it is but for the loaves, &amp; if any be truely converted, 'tis
not above five or ſeaven at moſt? Theſe things as they are
very grievous to us to heare, ſo we take God to witnes, that
as we are in fincerity exerciſed in a great deale of care and
travell to carry on the worke: ſo we publiſh to the world no
more then what we have received, and beleeve to be really
true. And if theſe teſtimonies related in the foregoing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
be not ſufficient to ſatisfie any ſtill doubting ſpirit,
there are ſome eminent Gentlemen come from thence, who
are ready to reſolve them in the truth hereof, as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

Hopkins,</hi> late Governour of <hi>Conectacutt,</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

Willowby,</hi> (and others) a late Magiſtrate of the <hi>Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſets.</hi>
Beſides if any ſhall repaire to <hi>Coopers Hall,</hi> we
ſhall be willing to ſhew them the originall Copies we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
which we have tranſcribed for the Preſſe: the time
for any to repaire thither is Saturday every weeke between
the houres of ten and twelve in the Morning, where our Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration
ſit, and where we ſhall gladly take paines to ſatisfie
the doubts of any: and thinke nothing too much wherein we
may be ſerviceable to the Lord Jeſus in a worke having ſo
much tendency to his glory in the propagation of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
