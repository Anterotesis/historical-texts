         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>To <hi>Adam</hi> thus created and made Lord of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
the Lord himſelfe bringeth the creatures to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
their names, which hee giveth to them agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to their natures, and that at the firſt ſight, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:123992:5"/>
at once his dominion over them, and his wiſedom,
among them all he ſeeth no fit match for himſelfe, but
by ſeeing every one of them mated, and that they
came before him by paires, he is brought to bee ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of his owne want of a fellow: which thereupon
<hi>God</hi> provideth for him out of his owne body of a rib,
which part of him might beſt be ſpared. And thus the
Creation endeth in the making of the woman.</p>
               <p>CHAP. III. The woman thinking it had beene
a good Angell that ſpake in the trunk of the <hi>Serpent,</hi> ſhe
entereth communication with the Devill: who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
her both to adde and to diminiſh to, and from
the Commandement that was given them, groweth
the more impudent to tempt, and ſeduceth her by the
<hi>lust of the fleſh and the luſt of the eyes, and the pride of
life,</hi> as 1. Iohn 2. 16. And ſhee perſwadeth her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
and ſo they both are fallen on the very ſame
day that they are created, <hi>Gen. 9. 1, 2, 3. Pſal.</hi> 49. 12.</p>
               <p>Chriſt is promiſed before the man and the woman
are cenſured: and they are queſtioned alſo before they
be ſentenced, but ſo was not Satan, for <hi>God</hi> had mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
in ſtore for them, but none for him. The curſe is not
upon man himſelfe but upon the Earth, to teach him
to ſet his affections on things above and not on the
curſed ground, and not to look for an earthly Kingdom
of Chriſt on this Earth which the Lord hath curſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adam</hi> apprehendeth and layeth hold upon the
promiſe by Faith, and in evidence of this his faith he
calleth his wives name <hi>Eve</hi> or <hi>Life,</hi> becauſe ſhee was
to be the mother of Chriſt according to the fleſh, by
whom life ſhould come; and of all beleevers that by
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:123992:6"/>
faith ſhould live in him, for an outward ſigne and ſeale
of this his Faith, and for a further and more lively ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
of the ſame; God teacheth him the rite of
ſacrifice, to lay Chriſt dying before his eyes in a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
figure: And with the skins of the ſacrificed
beaſts <hi>God</hi> teacheth him and his wife to cloath their
bodies. And thus the firſt thing that dyeth in the
world is Chriſt in a figure.</p>
               <p>At the end of this third chapter imagine the three
firſt <hi>verſes</hi> of chapter. 2. concerning the Sabbath to
be obſerved, to come in, and ſuppoſe the texture of
the ſtory to lye thus. <hi>Adam</hi> thus fallen, cenſured
recovered, inſtructed and expelled <hi>Eden</hi> on the ſixt
day, the next day following he by <hi>Gods</hi> appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
keepeth for a Sabbath or an holy reſt, and ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it onely in divine duties. Now the reaſon why it
ſtandeth in the place where it doth, chap. 2. Is part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> would lay the ſeven dayes, or the
firſt weeke of the world altogether without interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
and partly becauſe he would ſhew by ſetting
it before <hi>Adams</hi> fall, that had hee perſiſted in inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
yet muſt he have obſerved a Sabbath.</p>
               <p>The ſeventh day or Sabbath is not bounded in the
text with the ſame limits that the other dayes are, for
it is not ſaid of it as it was of them, <hi>The Evening and
the Morning were the ſeventh day,</hi> becauſe a time ſhould
come when it ſhould have a new beginning and end,
and though to the <hi>Iewes</hi> it was from Even to Even yet
from the beginning it was not ſo expreſſed.</p>
               <p>CHAP. 4. <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> twinnes of one birth; and
firſt was borne he that was naturall, and after he that
was ſpirituall.</p>

                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:123992:6"/>
The faith of <hi>Abell</hi> appeared in the very materialls
of his ſacrifice; it being of ſlaine beaſts and ſo a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation
of the death of Chriſt: for this, it is fired
from Heaven, and <hi>Caines</hi> is not, though his drye eares
of Corne were materialls farie more combuſtible.
<hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abell</hi> were both their own Prieſts, for it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be proved that Sacrifices were ever offered but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
emergent occaſions, till the Law fixed it for a
common ſervice: and he that had ſuch an occaſion,
had libertie to be his own Prieſt, even under the Law
as it appeareth by <hi>Gedeon, Manoah, &amp;c.</hi> and then much
more was that liberty before.</p>
               <p>The word <hi>Sinne,</hi> in <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. ſeemeth rather to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
an offering or attonement for ſinne then puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
For firſt <hi>God</hi> commeth not to deject <hi>Cain</hi> low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
then he was, but to raiſe him from his dejection, as
it appeareth both by his deigning to give him an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
from Heaven, and alſo by the words wherewith
he beginneth. Secondly if the words, <hi>Sinne lieth at
the doore,</hi> intend ſuddain Iudgement ready to devoure
him, what dependance can the words following have
with theſe? <hi>If thou doe not well, thou ſhalt certainely be
puniſhed, and thy brothers deſire ſhall be ſubject to thee:</hi> for
this were to threaten poore <hi>Abell</hi> more, or at leaſt as
much as <hi>Cain.</hi> Thirdly the Originall word <hi>Chateath</hi>
as it ſignifieth <hi>Sinne,</hi> ſo alſo doth it the ſacrifice for
ſinne, as <hi>Hoſ. 4. 8. 2 Cor.</hi> 5. 21. And all along <hi>Leviticus,</hi>
and it was the cuſtome, according to which <hi>Moſes</hi>
ſpeaketh as beſt knowne, to lay the Sacrifice at the
Sanctuary doore.</p>

he was not of his ſinne, beggeth of <hi>God,</hi> that he might
die to eaſe him of it, <hi>Therefore let any one that findeth
me kill mee,</hi> but this <hi>God</hi> denyeth to him reſerving him
to a lingring puniſhment: and <hi>Caine</hi> being aſſured of

               <p>Chap. 25. At what time <hi>Abraham</hi> married <hi>Keturah</hi> is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine:
the text hath laid it after <hi>Iſaacs</hi> marriage, becauſe it
was fit that all the actions of <hi>Abraham</hi> which any whit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
the promiſe, ſhould be handled firſt and together, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the other which either did not at all or did it the leſſe.
But that <hi>Abraham</hi> was married to this woman, long before
<hi>Iſaacs</hi> marriage or <hi>Sarahs</hi> death, is probable upon theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures.
1. He that held it ſtrange to have a ſon at an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
yeeres old, it is not like he would marry at an hundred
and forty. 2. In c. 24. 36. when the ſervant is to make the
match for <hi>Iſaac,</hi> he ſaith that <hi>Abraham</hi> had given all his eſtate
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:123992:10"/>
to <hi>Iſaac,</hi> which had bin unneceſſary to mention, had he had
no more children but <hi>Iſmael</hi> who was gone from his houſe
long before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Abrahams</hi> diſpoſing of his ſons into the Eaſt Countries or
<hi>Arabia,</hi> was not upon uſurpation, but upon juſt claime by

               </p>
               <p>When the text hath recited theſe ſons of <hi>Abraham</hi> and their
ſettlement, it bringeth him and <hi>Iſmael</hi> to their graves: Not
that they died before the birth of <hi>Iacob,</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> as the text
hath laid it, for <hi>Abraham</hi> lived till they were fifteen yeeres
old, and <hi>Iſmael</hi> till they were at their climactericall yeer of
63. but now hath <hi>Moſes</hi> no more to ſay of them, and therefor
he concludeth their ſtory at once. <hi>Eſau</hi> borne all hairy over

him <hi>Eſau, Factus, made,</hi> and perfected already as having both

               <p>In a ſore yeere of famine in the land, <hi>Eſau ſelleth his birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right

what age <hi>Iſmael</hi> his brother had died, by his example, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
to thinke of his own death, and to diſpoſe himſelfe for
that. He ſendeth <hi>Eſau to hunt</hi> for veniſon <hi>for a triall,</hi> whether
he ſhould bleſſe him or no, for miſſing of veniſon before, hee
had loſt his birth-right, and if he miſſe to day as he did then,
it would be a ſure ſigne that he muſt loſe the bleſsing: And
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:123992:11"/>
ſo though <hi>Iſaac</hi> had paſſed away the maine bleſsing at una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares,

that it was the will of God he ſhould have ſome bleſsing, and
