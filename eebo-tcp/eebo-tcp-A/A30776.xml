            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Priviledge of our SAINTS In the business of PERJURY. Useful for <hi>GRAND-JURIES.</hi>
            </head>
            <byline>By the Author of <hi>HUDIBRAS.</hi>
            </byline>
            <lg>
               <l>THat Saints may claim a Dispensation</l>
               <l>To Swear and Forswear on occasion,</l>
               <l>I doubt not but it will appear</l>
               <l>With pregnant light, the point is clear:</l>
               <l>Oaths are but words, and words but wind,</l>
               <l>Too feeble Implements to bind.</l>
               <l>And Saints whom Oaths or Vows oblige,</l>
               <l>Know little of their Priviledge:</l>
               <l>Further, I mean, than carrying on</l>
               <l>Some self-advantage of their own:</l>
               <l>For if the Devil, to serve his turn,</l>
               <l>Can tell Truth, why the Saints should scorn</l>
               <l>When it serves theirs, to Swear and Lye,</l>
               <l>I think there's little reason why:</l>
               <l>Else h'has a greater pow'r than they,</l>
               <l>Which 'twere Impiety to say.</l>
               <l>W'are not commanded to forbear</l>
               <l>Indefinitely, at all to Swear,</l>
               <l>But to Swear idly and in vain,</l>
               <l>Without Self-interest or Gain.</l>
               <l>For breaking of an Oath, and Lying,</l>
               <l>Is but a kind of Self-denying;</l>
               <l>A Saint-like vertue, and from hence.</l>
               <l>Some have broke Oaths by Providence:</l>
               <l>Some, to the glory of the Lord</l>
               <l>Perjur'd themselves, and broke their word;</l>
               <l>And this the constant rule and practice</l>
               <l>Of all our late Apostles Acts is.</l>
               <l>Was not the Cause at first begun</l>
               <l>With Perjury, and carried on?</l>
               <l>Was there an Oath the Godly took,</l>
               <l>But in due time and place they broke?</l>
               <l>Did not our Worthies of the House,</l>
               <l>Before they broke the Peace, break Vows?</l>
               <l>For having freed us first from both</l>
               <l>Th' Allegiance and Supremacy Oath,</l>
               <l>Did they not next compel the Nation</l>
               <l>To take and break the Protestation?</l>
               <l>To take th' Engagement and disclaim it,</l>
               <l>Enforc'd by those who first did frame it?</l>
               <l>Did they not Swear at first to Fight</l>
               <l>For the Kings Safety and his Right?</l>
               <l>And after march'd to find him out,</l>
               <l>And charg'd him home with Horse and Foot;</l>
               <l>And yet still had the confidence</l>
               <l>To swear it was in his Defence.</l>
               <l>Did they not Swear to Live and Die</l>
               <l>With <hi>Essex,</hi> and straight laid him by?</l>
               <l>Did they not Swear to maintain Law,</l>
               <l>In which that Swearing made a Flaw?</l>
               <l>For Protestant Religion Vow,</l>
               <l>Which did that vowing disallow?</l>
               <l>For Priviledge of Parliament,</l>
               <l>In which that Swearing made a Rent?</l>
               <l>And since, of all the three not one</l>
               <l>Was left in being, 'tis well known.</l>
               <l>Did they not Swear in express words,</l>
               <l>To prop and back the House of Lords?</l>
               <l>And after turn'd out the whole Houseful,</l>
               <l>Of Peers as dangerous and unuseful?</l>
               <l>This tells us plainly what they thought,</l>
               <l>That Oaths and Swearing go for nought.</l>
               <l>And that by them th'were only meant</l>
               <l>To serve for an expedient.</l>
               <l>Oaths were not purpos'd more than Law,</l>
               <l>To keep the Good and Just in awe,</l>
               <l>But to confine the bad and sinful,</l>
               <l>Like moral Cattel in a Pinfold.</l>
               <l>A Saint's of th' heavenly Realm a Peer;</l>
               <l>And as no Peer is bound to Swear,</l>
               <l>But on the Gospel of his Honor,</l>
               <l>Of which he may dispose as owner;</l>
               <l>It follows though the thing be forgery,</l>
               <l>And false, they affirm it is no Perjury,</l>
               <l>But a meer ceremony, and a breach</l>
               <l>Of nothing, but a form of speech,</l>
               <pb facs="tcp:58207:2"/>
               <l>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:58207:2"/>
And goes for no more when 'tis took,</l>
               <l>Than meer saluting of the Book.</l>
               <l>Suppose the Scriptures are of force,</l>
               <l>They're but Commissions of course,</l>
               <l>And Saints have freedom to digress,</l>
               <l>And vary from 'em as they please,</l>
               <l>Or mis-interpret them by privat</l>
               <l>Instructions to all Aims they drive at;</l>
               <l>Then why should we ourselves abridge,</l>
               <l>And curtail our own Priviledge?</l>
               <l>'Tis the temptation of the Devil</l>
               <l>That makes all humane actons evil:</l>
               <l>For Saints may do the same things by</l>
               <l>The Spirit in sincerity,</l>
               <l>Which other men are tempted to,</l>
               <l>And at the Devils instance do;</l>
               <l>And yet the action be contrary,</l>
               <l>Just as the Saints and Wicked vary.</l>
               <l>But as on Land there is no Beast,</l>
               <l>But in some Fish at Sea's exprest,</l>
               <l>So in the Wicked there's no Vice,</l>
               <l>Of which the Saints have not a spice;</l>
               <l>And yet that thing that's pious in</l>
               <l>The one, in th' other is a sin.</l>
               <l>Is't not ridiculous and non-sense</l>
               <l>A Saint should be a slave to Conscience?</l>
               <l>That ought to be above such Fancies</l>
               <l>As far, as above Ordinances.</l>
               <l>The <hi>Rabbins</hi> write, when any Jew</l>
               <l>Did make to God or Man a Vow,</l>
               <l>Which afterwards he found untoward,</l>
               <l>And stubborn to be kept, or too hard,</l>
               <l>Any three other Jews o'th' Nation</l>
               <l>Might free him from the Obligation;</l>
               <l>And have not two SS—power to use</l>
               <l>A greater priviledge than three Jews?</l>
               <l>The Court of Conscience which in man,</l>
               <l>Should be supreme and sovereign;</l>
               <l>Is't fit should be subordinate</l>
               <l>To every petty Court i'th' State,</l>
               <l>And have no power at all, nor shift</l>
               <l>To help it self at a dead lift?</l>
               <l>Why should not Conscience have Vacation,</l>
               <l>As well as other Courts o'th' Nation?</l>
               <l>Have equal power to Adjourn,</l>
               <l>Appoint Appearance and Return?</l>
               <l>Do not your Juries give their Verdict</l>
               <l>As if they felt the Cause not heard it?</l>
               <l>And as they please make matter of Fact</l>
               <l>Run all on one side as they're packt.</l>
               <l>When each man Swears to do his best</l>
               <l>To Damn and Perjure all the rest,</l>
               <l>And bids the Devil take the hinmost,</l>
               <l>Which at this Race is like to win most.</l>
               <l>Nature has made man's breast no windores</l>
               <l>To publish what he does within doors,</l>
               <l>Nor what dark Secrets there inhabit,</l>
               <l>Unless his own rash Folly blab it.</l>
               <l>If Oaths can do a man no good,</l>
               <l>In his own business, why they shou'd</l>
               <l>In other matters do him hurt,</l>
               <l>I think there's little reason for't:</l>
               <l>He that imposes an Oath makes it,</l>
               <l>Not he that for convenience takes it:</l>
               <l>Then how can any man be said</l>
               <l>To break an Oath he never made?</l>
               <l>These reasons may perhaps look odly</l>
               <l>To th' Wicked, though they evince the Godly</l>
               <l>For if we should defend the Cause</l>
               <l>By the strict Rule of Gospel-Laws,</l>
               <l>And only do what they call just,</l>
               <l>The Cause would quickly fall to dust.</l>
               <l>This we among our selves may speak,</l>
               <l>But to the wicked or the weak</l>
