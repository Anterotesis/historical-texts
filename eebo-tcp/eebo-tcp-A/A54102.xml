            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

         <div type="introduction">
            <head type="sub">The Introduction.</head>
            <p>IT is a Judgment upon ſome Men, not only to miſtake, but to refuſe to be informed; as it is the worſt of Natures to be afraid that other men ſhould be in the Right.</p>
            <p>All <hi>Diſſenters</hi> muſt be in the Wrong, <hi>whether they be or no</hi>: And they muſt not mean any thing that is Good, by good Words, <hi>whether they do or no.</hi> Though it were that they ſhould ſay they would not have the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or National Church deſtroy'd, and only pray for a little room to exerciſe their own way quietly, and that they will pray for, and pay Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute cheerfully to their Auſpicious <hi>Caeſar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And why all this Unkindneſs and Injuſtice, but for fear ſuch men of Wrath and Intereſt ſhould want a pretence to deſtroy them? Which in my opinion ſhews them ill Sons of the Church, that <hi>unwillingly</hi> believe well of another, and had rather they were in the <hi>Wrong</hi> than in the <hi>Right.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For in all the late Pamphlets againſt <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> there's not one word of winning one poor <hi>Diſſenter</hi> to the Church, no more than of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55933:2"/>
Tolerating them out of the Church. But how peaceable ſoever he be, he is caſt out for a Veſſel of Wrath, good for nothing but to be <hi>Hang'd</hi> here, and <hi>Damn'd</hi> hereafter.</p>
            <p>It is a Melancholly Proſpect for him, but not without Inſtruction, and ſome Hope. For Extreams do the Authors of them no good: And theſe <hi>Flaſhes</hi> may be but a Lightning before Death, I mean, of <hi>Severity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is always darkeſt before Day: <hi>Eaſe</hi> and <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> for all this, may yet dawn under the Government of our Brave King.</p>
            <p>And who would not hope a little longer, that has ſtay'd all this while? Will other Princes give better Terms in their Countries, or keep them better? Let's then be Patient and Humble, and pray God to mollifie the Hearts, even of them that hate us. <hi>Vincit qui patitur.</hi> And ſo I come to the ſevere <hi>Gentleman</hi> againſt the <hi>D<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>KE of B<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>CKINGHAM</hi> and his <hi>SECONDS,</hi> for <hi>Men of No Conſcience</hi>; in which we ſhall have a meaſure of his, of his own giving, and that will ſhow it to be none of the beſt.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="body_of_text">
            <p>HE begins, page 3. with the <hi>Loyalty</hi> of the <hi>Houſe of Commons,</hi> and the reaſon of his Judgment, to wit, <hi>If we conſider, Who has choſen them, and Who are choſen.</hi> Now, no body doubts their <hi>Loyalty,</hi> without this lucky Reaſon given by the <hi>Squire, of Who choſe them, and Who are choſen.</hi> The caſe is plain, and needed not his officious Note upon the Houſe, for Spectacles to the People.</p>
            <p>But if it be ſo, <hi>The Diſſenters Inſolence is inſufferable in their Pleas for Liberty of Conſcience.</hi> Which I take to be a Reflection upon that great Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly; it prejudges their Wiſdom and Goodneſs. What knows he which way Reaſon of State may incline their Judgment; or what Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives may induce their Debates and Reſolves. Is it <hi>Inſolence,</hi> and that unſufferable too, for men to humbly pray, they may have leave to ſay their Prayers in another way than that which is common?</p>
            <p>If any Man has done ill, muſt the Principle ſuffer, and the Party pay the Reckoning, eſpecially if neither be in the Fault? Here's a <hi>Loyal</hi> Parliament, <hi>Ergo, A Million of People muſt be Ruin'd.</hi> A fine <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and as good a <hi>States-man.</hi> I hope, there's <hi>Preference</hi> of one, without <hi>Deſtruction</hi> of the reſt, and <hi>Rebuke</hi> without <hi>Ruin.</hi> The Diſſenter may <hi>live,</hi> though the Church-man only be <hi>preferr'd.</hi> And only let him be <hi>preferrd,</hi> ſo that t'other may not be <hi>confounded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He ſays, Pag. 3, 4. <hi>Liberty of Conſcience has imbroyl'd three Nations in Blood, and yet the Patrons of it allow'd it not to one another, as</hi> Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, Independents, &amp;c. <hi>Nor did they to King</hi> Charles <hi>the Firſt, the</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:55933:2"/>
Church of England, <hi>or</hi> Roman Catholicks. He might have added the <hi>Quakers</hi> too, that ſuffer'd more Cruelties than any other Party, under them.</p>
            <p>But I pray, how does this ſhake the Reaſonableneſs of <hi>Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience?</hi> For, <hi>Firſt,</hi> that was not any part of the ſtated Quarrel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the King and Parliament. <hi>Secondly,</hi> If they that made the War, <hi>diſown'd</hi> it, and <hi>deny'd</hi> it, how were they Patrons of it? Or how did that Principle come to lay three Kingdoms in Blood? It ſeems then that <hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi> muſt pay the Reckoning of the Men that are againſt it; or that becauſe thoſe Men were againſt it (and therein doubtleſs did very Ill) therefore the <hi>Church of England</hi> would do ill to give it. Make this good, and he ſhall be my Oracle.</p>
            <p>But why? for fear they ſhould be undone by giving it, becauſe they were undone that did not give it. Mighty well argued! This Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man bids for the firſt Doctor next Act at <hi>Oxford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>You would not give it to me,</hi> that you wou'd not, and therefore why ſhould I give it to you? No ſuch matter; Truly I don't intend it. This is pretty <hi>Logick!</hi> 'tis Demonſtration, backward. But <hi>Paſſion,</hi> though it rules Women, it ſhould not Rule in the Church. Wiſe and Good Men, conſider the Right and Prudence of a thing, to which private Paſſions are made ſubmit.</p>
            <p>Pag. 5. But the <hi>Proteſtant Diſſenters deſerve no Liberty, becauſe in</hi> Seventy Two <hi>they were for Liberty with the</hi> Papiſts, <hi>in</hi> Eighty <hi>without them, and now in</hi> Eighty Five <hi>it is not only lawful, but neceſſary that the</hi> Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks <hi>have their Liberty too.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Granting this to be ſo, what's that to <hi>Liberty of Conſcience?</hi> It only ſhows the <hi>Partiality</hi> of the Men, and perhaps that would have been granted him for a word's asking. This proves nothing againſt the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, though the <hi>Squire</hi> upon this ſo fiercely concludes, <hi>all the Villanies in the World againſt Liberty of Conſcience.</hi> But when he has done all he can, they were not <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> under Correction, that in <hi>Eighty</hi> proſecuted the <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> and refuſed them <hi>Liberty,</hi> but <hi>Church of England<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> and ſuch of them too, as would not allow it to ſome <hi>Proteſtant Diſſenters,</hi> for fear that <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſhould hide themſelves amongſt them, and that they therefore muſt ſwallow the moſt ſevere <hi>Teſts</hi> that could be fram'd to ſhow themſelves not Friends to that Communion. And to tell truth, and I beſeech the <hi>Gentleman,</hi> not to take it amiſs that I ſay, the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> were invited to the ſhare they had in oppoſition to <hi>Popery,</hi> by Church-men, ay, they were for a <hi>Comprehenſion,</hi> to make the Church ſtand broader, the better to receive the Aſſaults of <hi>Rome</hi> without hazard. And had the <hi>Diſſenter</hi> been more modeſt to his Miſtreſs, and not ſo malepert and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55933:3"/>
officious, he had doubtleſs been upon better Terms with her now. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, her Anger muſt not endure forever, nor deſtroy her Servant for being too buſie or eager in the Service ſhe call'd him to.</p>
            <p>Well, <hi>But the</hi> Duke <hi>of</hi> Buckingham's Seconds <hi>are Men of no Conſcience becauſe they charge the Excluſion upon the Members of the Church of</hi> England, This is ſo bitterly reſented, that we are told, <hi>That an honeſt</hi> Turk <hi>would have ſcorn'd ſo baſe a Practice, within five years after the Fact, and in a Caſe wherein the whole Nation knows the contrary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If Excluſion, or no Excluſion, be to determine the true from the falſe <hi>Church of England Men,</hi> as pag. 7. the Propoſition will be doubly falſe; For there are men that were not for Excluſion, that were not Members of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and there are Members of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> that were for the Excluſion. And to this charge in the <hi>Reply</hi> and the <hi>Defence,</hi> he gives no Anſwer, but Anger, which for a Man to avoid, when the Queſtion lies upon it, &amp; that grounded upon matter of Fact, ſhows his fear of Succeſs, and that, the weakneſs of his Cauſe. But ſince the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> by whole-ſale are to bear the blame, I do affirm the <hi>Excluders</hi> were <hi>Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts,</hi> and are yet <hi>Communicants of your Church,</hi> and the greateſt part of them upon Education and conſtant Practice too. And that this is Truth, and no Slander, read the Liſt, and 'tis a demonſtration. Nay, I challenge the <hi>Gentleman</hi> to name <hi>ſix</hi> Perſons of all the <hi>Excluders,</hi> that diſſent from the eſtabliſhed Church.</p>
            <p>Nor is this of yeſterday; for if we look back, we ſhall ſee the moſt celebrated Biſhops of our Church <hi>barring</hi> the Succeſſion in the Law of the 13th and 27th of <hi>Q. Eliz.</hi>
               <note rend="inter">See Sir Sim. Dew. pag. 140. &amp; 207.</note> and when that Queen pleaded Conſcience in not aſſenting to a Law to put our King's great Grand Mother, <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> to Death, the ſame Reverend Biſhops undertook to remove the Scruple; yet nothing but, <hi>Away with thoſe Diſloyal Diſſenters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Own them then ingenuouſly, that they are Members of your own Church, and that their Defection began within your ſelves, and that, for all your Invectives, and turning them over now to the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe your are aſhamed of them, they are in communion with you ſtill, and daily <hi>Conformiſts</hi> to the Worſhip, and as ſuch, are admitted to the accuſtomed <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Priviledges</hi> of your Church. Page 7. <hi>To charge all Addreſſes and the</hi> Oxford <hi>Parliament to the account of Diſſenters, is not wiſe, any more than true, for it is to give the greater Numbers to the diſſenting party, ſince it is plain, how unequal they were that fell in with that excluding humor in the Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this is not all he has ſaid, to prevent the <hi>Legiſlative</hi> Goodneſs to <hi>Diſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nters.</hi> They muſt not have Liberty, <hi>leſt it be charged upon the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55933:3"/>
Government as a deſign to bring in Popery and Arbitrary Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I remember a Story of <hi>Harry Martin,</hi> that when <hi>Cromwell</hi> came to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the Rump, to juſtifie his Action, among other things, he accuſed ſome of their Members of an <hi>evil Life,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Here ſits a Drunkard, and there</hi> (pointing to him) <hi>ſits an Whore-maſter; Harry Martin</hi> ſitting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two ſober grave men, jogg'd them, ſaying, <hi>Which of you two does he mean?</hi> The <hi>Diſſenters</hi> muſt be blam'd of thoſe that are Guilty. 'Tis hard to ſuffer for Faults, and be chid of them that did them.</p>
            <p>No, 'twas the Gentlemen of that Communion that impeach'd the Prerogative, in the Declaration of <hi>Indulgence,</hi> and ſet the <hi>Political capacity of the King in oppoſition to his National,</hi> and to make their buſineſs more popular, beſtow'd that Comment upon it, of <hi>a deſign in the Court to let in</hi> Popery <hi>and Arbitrary Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the whole matter, 'tis not unworthy of ſome thought, that this way of making <hi>Whigs</hi> and <hi>Fanaticks</hi> of all, that in every Point come not up to a Hair, though otherwiſe Men of <hi>Virtue, Piety, Wiſdom,</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly Church-men, may prove of ill Conſequence: for it narrows, where it is <hi>Wiſdom</hi> to enlarge, and greatens, where <hi>Prudence</hi> enclines to leſſen, I mean the Credit of Number.</p>
            <p>This makes me the more admire one Expreſſion, <hi>viz</hi> pag. 8. <hi>That the Members of the</hi> Church of England <hi>have turn'd over to the</hi> Diſſenters <hi>all the Excluders, and lay'd the Bill of Excluſion at their Doors, and waſh'd her Hands of them, as</hi> Pilot <hi>did of our Saviours Blood,</hi> Where, beſides the falſe Politicks of making ſo many thouſand <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

But how <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> comes to be beholding to the Duke, whoſe Concluſion excludes it utterly, of which a Boy of ſeven Years old is judge, let the <hi>Gentleman</hi> conſider once more.</p>
            <p>However, his Grace may happen to ask this <hi>Gentleman</hi> once in his Life, if he be the man that charges him with leading the Dance to men of <hi>no Honour, no Conſcience, no Honeſty,</hi> and that advocates a Cauſe of ſo much <hi>Treaſon</hi> and <hi>Impiety,</hi> as is laid to the charge of Liberty of Conſcience.</p>
            <p>To the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> Objection, Pag. 10. he ſays, in their Name, <hi>That all the ill things they have done, is becauſe there are Laws made againſt them, and that they would be quiet, if they might have their Liberty</hi>; and tells us, <hi>That their ill and diſloyal Practices in Queen</hi> Elizabeth's <hi>time, drew the firſt Law upon them, and that was the</hi> 35<hi>th of the Queen.</hi> But that is no An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the Objection, for they were made dangerous, as Conventicles are now, by ſuſpition and prevention, not that they did any ill thing deſerving that Severity; but Church Refractorineſs, Biſhop <hi>Whitgiſt</hi> was pleaſed to tranſlate into Sedition: The old way, <hi>Indeed, my Lord, they are Enemies to</hi> Caeſar, <hi>and Exalters of another King, one</hi> JESUS. So that 'tis begging the Queſtion, to ground this Law on the ſeditious Practices of the <hi>Diſſenters</hi>; and we are to learn when any of our Time had a tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to abuſe, or when any ſuch thing was in beeing, to charge our Political or Eccleſiaſtical Calamities upon. I only pray to be informed, I ſay, <hi>when, where</hi> and <hi>how?</hi> For I am intirely of his mind, pag. 10. <hi>That wiſe Men will try as few Concluſions in Government</hi> (if ſettled) <hi>as is poſſible; and yet when only one Concluſion is left to be tryed, and that ſo neceſſarily pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and preſt, methinks 'tis not unwiſe to make the Experiment, when Mercy, Goodneſs and Charity are on that ſide.</hi>

            <p>But alas! the Author of this <hi>Apology</hi> is not contented to faſten upon an occaſion given, and improve it with all the aggravation of an unkind Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but turns <hi>Fortune-teller,</hi> and reads us a Lecture by the ſlying of his <hi>Jack-daw,</hi> of our own inſides &amp; future Devices: A down-right Divination and Enthuſiaſm, as if he had been on an Errand to <hi>Delphos.</hi> Hear him, pag. 11. <hi>That we were all thunder-ſtruck, dreaded a Prince we had offended, and that had ſo much diligence and courage to repay us, and therefore turned</hi> Trimers, <hi>went to Church, took the Sacrament, gave up the Game, ſet up for Loyal: And that in this Melancholly frame, it was his Grace found us when he publiſht his Eſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

well as untrue. I ſee <hi>Diſſenters</hi> Vertues (as few as they are) muſt be their Vices for a <hi>need:</hi> Their <hi>quietneſs</hi> is from the <hi>ſtroke of Guilt,</hi> and their <hi>Conformity</hi> only <hi>Hypocriſie for Safety:</hi> They have a fine time of it, and are mightily oblig'd to this <hi>Gentleman's</hi> Goodneſs and Juſtice, much good may it do'um.

            </p>
            <p>But this cry for Liberty here, is to break out with <hi>Argile's</hi> Plot in <hi>Scotland.</hi> This is ſhrewdly hit. Politick every bit of it I thought <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gile's Presbyterians</hi> and Liberty had not agreed ſo well together: I have heard ſuch Folks hold as ill an Opinion of it, as this <hi>Gentleman,</hi> for his Ears.</p>

But if they will give us as good Quarter as they have received from the three or four <hi>Pamphlets</hi> for Liberty, I dare make the Bargain, that the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> ſhall look no farther after Biſhopricks, nor Church Livings, and I would to God it might reſt there.</p>
            <p>What a ſtir is here that men <hi>pray to be quiet</hi>? O! but we know you won't be quiet, and therefore you ſhan't be quiet: There is nothing ſo idle, as being very cunning, and making every thing a Plot. So <hi>Tacitus</hi> makes <hi>Tiberius</hi> to have a deep one, <hi>in going to the Houſe of Office:</hi> To be ſure it was a neceſſary one.</p>
            <p>His Concluſion is hard upon us that advocates the Cauſe of tender Conſciences, ſaying, <hi>We are men of no Honour, no Conſcience, nor Honeſty,</hi> but leaves the proof to be underſtood.</p>
            <p>Certainly he cannot have too much of thoſe good Qualities, that advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates <hi>Tertullus</hi> like, againſt tender Conſciences, and to give him his due, he is ſenſible of it; for he preſently acknowledges <hi>his ſharpneſs,</hi> but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes it with the baſeneſs of thoſe that <hi>dare affirm the Excluders were Church of</hi> England <hi>Men.</hi> But for all that, it falls out to be true, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>Truth</hi> pinches any Body.</p>
            <p>He concludes in defence of the <hi>Church of England's</hi> Severity, and ſays, <hi>Tell me how Chriſt can be Head of oppoſite Bodies?</hi> But what then? muſt you perſecute where your Head forbids it? Though he is not Head of oppoſite Bodies, he does not deſtroy the Bodies of which he is not Head. But what does this Man think of an oppoſite Head and Body, the Head of one Mind, and the Body of another? An Head and no Member. <hi>Riddle me, Riddle me, what's this?</hi>

            <p>By this never truſt me, one would think him a Divine, every Inch of him, that can ſo cleaverly take <hi>Not Tolerating</hi> IN <hi>Communion,</hi> for <hi>Not Tolerating</hi> OUT <hi>of Communion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But is this the Diſſenters caſe? Have they askt for the Churches, or do they uſurp the Pulpits? or <hi>out</hi> of your Communion either, do they teach the uſe of <hi>Fornication,</hi> and <hi>Idolatrous</hi> Food? What ſtuff is this for a man of ſome Wit and Words?

            <p>For his Query, <hi>How long Toleration has been a Chriſtian Virtue</hi>? 'Tis plain, ever ſince Chriſt came, <hi>That bid the Tares ſhould grow with the Wheat till the Harveſt,</hi> which his own bleſſed Comment ſays, <hi>Is the end of the World,</hi> where I ſhould be glad to meet this Gentleman, upon my Word.
