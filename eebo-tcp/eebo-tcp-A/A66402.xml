            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ANSWER TO THE Late SPEECHES of the Five Jeſuits.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>THE words of dying perſons have always been eſteemed of greateſt Authority,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Harcourt</hi> in his Speech doth obſerve: and at the firſt ſight, what was ſpoken by him and his Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates juſt before their Execution, doth ſeem to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it; when Mr. <hi>Gawen</hi> after the like Preface doth add, <hi>I do ſolemnly ſwear, proteſt and vow by all that is ſacred in Heaven or on Earth, and as I hope to ſee the Face of God in Glory, that I am as Innocent as the child unborn,</hi> &amp;c. A Speech of ſo great Aſſurance, that if it were not for the clearneſs of the Evidence that was brought in againſt them, the impartiality of the Court which they ſtood before and were Condemned by, the Order which they were of, and the curſed Principles held by that Order; and Laſtly, other things ſpoken by them at the ſame time that were manifeſtly untrue, I ſhould have had ſo much charity as to believe. But when all this and more doth appear againſt them, and confute what they have with ſo much confidence main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained before God and the World, it will be a work of Juſtice and Charity to detect their Hypocriſie, and to ſhew that the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> have a Goſpel by themſelves.</p>
            <p>And this I ſhall do:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:106692:3"/>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> By ſhewing that their preſent caſe is ſuch, that although they had been guilty, ſuch a Proteſtation of their innocence was neceſſary, if it might be conſiſtent with the principles of Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That ſuch a Proteſtation is conſiſtent with their Principles, and what is agreeable to the practice of their Order.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That from the conſideration of their cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and a careful peruſal of what was ſaid by theſe perſons at the time of their death, there is ſufficient reaſon to believe that they acted upon ſuch Principles.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> It was neceſſary for them at this time, and in their circumſtances, tho never ſo deeply guilty, to ſtand upon their own vindication, and to vindicate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves after the moſt ſolemn way imaginable. For if this Plot ſhould be believed, and they diſcovered to be the Contrivers and Promoters of it, it would be a foul blemiſh to their Religion, and ſo great a diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to their Society, that all their Art and Induſtry could never be able to wipe it off. It would awaken the Princes of Chriſtendom, and they would never think themſelves ſecure till this Order followed that of the Templers, and was Univerſally diſſolved and extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated. It would make thoſe that mean well too among themſelves to abhor them, and open a fair way for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtantiſm to enter in upon them. And therefore it concerned them as much as might be to prevent it; and how could it be prevented, but by this way that they have taken. For if they had been ſilent under ſo great a charge as this, all the World would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded them Guilty; or if they had but faintly denied it, when the Evidence was ſo full and peremptory a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, the ſuſpitions that are abroad would have increaſed, and the Evidence already given in would be
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:106692:3"/>
further enquired into and made out. It was not a ſorry Evaſion, or ſome puny Equivocation that would put a ſtop to theſe miſchiefs, and ſet them right in the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the World, as they well enough underſtood; and therefore it concerned them, if the honour of their Religion, or that of their Society was dear to them, to betake themſelves to the moſt formal Proteſtations to enſure it; if ſo be it might be done with conſiſtency to their Religion, or their own ſafety in another World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſhall therefore ſhew that ſuch Proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are conſiſtent with their Religion, and that altho they were never ſo Guilty, they might ſtand upon their own Innocency and Juſtification to the Death. And that is to be done upon theſe Principles. (1) If what they are charged with be made Legitimate by a Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or Authority. (2.) If they are under a precedent and ſufficient Obligation not to confeſs what they are juſtly charged with. (3.) If they are indemnified and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared Innocent. (4.) If they are charged before an incompetent Authority. (5.) If the Charge it ſelf be laid wrong.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> If what they are charged with be made Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate and allowable by a Superior Authority; which may be done two ways.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> By a diſpenſation from the Pope, or by others ordinarily deputed thereunto in their Church. This is what they do now deny amongſt us, confidently main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining that a Diſpenſation is never given beforehand. But this is vainly alledged, whether we conſider the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Diſpenſation, which hath a relation to an action yet to be done, or to the continuation of it; or whether we conſider the <hi>practice</hi> of <hi>their Church,</hi> of which we have a very modern inſtance. For whereas the Marrying of a Brothers Wife, the Brother being yet alive, is both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Law of God and Nature; there is a Prince
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:106692:4"/>
now in the World that is diſpenſed with in that matter, and enjoys the Wife and Kingdom of his Brother by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Popes Authority. Now if the Pope hath a Power of altering the nature of things, and of giving a Diſpenſation for what would without that Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion have been in it ſelf unlawful; then the doing of an Action otherwiſe evil is, by virtue of that Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, no ſin; and he that hath that for his Authority, is ſo far Innocent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Action may be made Legitimate, by virtue of the command of ſuch a Superior, as they are bound fully and univerſally to obey. And this is the caſe of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> who are under a perfect Subjection to their Superiors, and whoſe commands they are not to diſpute. This is the firſt thing which they are taught, <hi>to be ſo Conformable to the Catholick Church</hi> (which in their ſence is the Pope) <hi>that if it defines that to be black, which appears to them to be white, they are notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without more ado to account it black</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">
                  <hi>Ignatii Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercit. Spirit. p.</hi> 141. <hi>reg.</hi> 13. <hi>Antw.</hi> 1635.</note>. And this is an obedience which they are not only bound to yield to the Apoſtolick Chair, but to the reſt of their Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors, and which their Founder <hi>Ignatius</hi> writ an Epiſtle on purpoſe to confirm them <note n="b" place="margin">Epiſt ad Patr. &amp; Fratr. Societ in Luſit.</note> in. An Epiſtle, that <hi>nothing can be added to, or taken from,</hi> ſaith their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Fr. Borgia</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">
                  <hi>Epiſt. ad Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres &amp; Fratres Aquitaniae, p.</hi> 63. <hi>num</hi> 9.</note>. An Epiſtle that is <hi>truly Divine,</hi> ſaith their General <hi>Mutius Vitelleſcus</hi>

                  <hi>Epiſt. ad Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres prov. So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciet. p.</hi> 441.</note>. In this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle it is that <hi>Ignatius</hi> doth lay down theſe things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>That they muſt look upon their Superior, not as a perſon obnoxious to error, but as Chriſt himſelf—who could not be deceived, nor would deceive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>That Whatever their Superior commands or thinks, that they muſt always be ready to defend, and by no means to reject.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Whatever he commands, that they muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to look upon as the command of Chriſt, and with a</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:106692:4"/>
               <hi>blind Reſolution without any doubt or delay, reſolve to do</hi> 
               <note n="e" place="margin">
                  <hi>N.</hi> 16. 17.</note> 
               <hi>without giving way to any humane reaſonings and diſcourſes,</hi> as their General <hi>Aquaviva</hi> expounds it <note n="f" place="margin">
                  <hi>Cl. Aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vivae Induſtriae, cap.</hi> 5 <hi>num.</hi> 6.</note>, <hi>that they renounce not only their own wills, but underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings alſo, and ſubmit them wholly to his, without calling any thing into queſtion; for otherwiſe the excellent virtue of blind obedience would fail,</hi> as <hi>Ignatius</hi> ſaith <note n="g" place="margin">
                  <hi>Ibid. n.</hi> 3. 9. <hi>&amp; n.</hi> 12.</note>. <hi>That every one muſt perſwade himſelf, that he is acted and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by Divine Providence, through his Superiors Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and that he ought to be in that caſe as a Carkaſs, which ſuffers it ſelf to be carried or diſpoſed of any way; or as a ſtaff in an old mans hand, which he directs as he pleaſeth,</hi> as it's fully expreſſed in their Conſtitutions <note n="h" place="margin">
                  <hi>Pars</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 1.</note>. Now if they are thus obliged blindly to obey their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors, and that whatever they command them, is without any demur to be done, they are ſo far innocent in their own account, and think that they may ſafely without doubt, purge themſelves as ſuch.</p>
            <p>But they may ſay that they are only obliged to this obedience in things Lawful, and no further, according to what <hi>Ignatius</hi> himſelf doth ſay <note n="i" place="margin">
                  <hi>Epiſt. p.</hi> 25. <hi>n.</hi> 18.</note>, and is further confirmed by their conſtitutions <note n="k" place="margin">
                  <hi>Pars</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 234.</note>. But is this likely to be the ſence, when their <hi>Superior is in the place of Chriſt</hi> 
               <note n="l" place="margin">
                  <hi>Aquavivae Induſtriae, c.</hi> 5. <hi>n.</hi> 6. <hi>Conſtitut. par.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 234. <hi>&amp; par.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 10. <hi>p.</hi> 183. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note>, <hi>and whom they are to ſubmit to as to him, and whom they are to attend to, whatever he be, how weak or inſufficient ſoever, as he repreſents the perſon of him, whoſe wiſdom cannot be deceived,</hi> as <hi>Ignatius</hi> ſaith <note n="m" place="margin">

            <p>This was the Defence which <hi>Garnet</hi> made for himſelf, why he at the firſt did not diſcover the Conſpiracy of the Gunpowder-Treaſon, and why he afterwards did obſtinately deny his knowledg of it; becauſe as he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, <hi>it was diſcloſed unto him by</hi> Greenwel <hi>the Jeſuit in Confeſſion, and that it would endanger the lives of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers men</hi>

The caſe then is, That if at any time a danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Conſpiracy is made known to them in Confeſſion, which they themſelves were actually before egaged in; yet it being thus complicated, that their own concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in it is joyned with the others confeſſion, they
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:106692:6"/>
then may and are bound to ſtand upon their own inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, becauſe they cannot plead guilty, though they are ſo, without betraying what they heard in Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They may juſtify themſelves, when they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnified and declared innocent by Abſolution. Pardon is a diſcharge from puniſhment, and Abſolution is a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal declaration of Pardon; and in it ſelf is not a making Innocent, but only an aſſurance, that a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, notwithſtanding his former crimes, ſhall be dealt with as if he were ſuch. But they extend this further, for ſuch a growing thing is power in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, that it would bring every thing within its compaſs. Sometimes Sin by the Pope's power ſhall be made none; and a Man ſhall violate his Oath, and by virtue of a Diſpenſation from his Holineſs ſhall become perjur'd without Sin. Sometimes the Guilty ſhall be made In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, and by the power of Abſolution ſhall be able to ſwear it. <hi>For if a perſon by confeſſion to a Prieſt, and Abſolution from him, hath what is ſufficient to Salvation,</hi> and to ſet him right in the ſight of God (as is the common opinion among them <note n="*" place="margin">Navar.

This ſeems to be the ground of the preſent practice amongſt them; as when <hi>Gurphy,</hi> after his Abſolution denied at his Death with all aſſurance imaginable, That he was guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of that Burglary, which he was in <hi>Ireland</hi> condemned for; though the Rope breaking he lived to confeſs it <note n="†" place="margin">Vid. <hi>The late printed Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, in a Letter to the Earl of</hi> Eſſex.</note>. And this principle hath ſo far prevailed at this day; that Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> doth ingenuouſly acknowledg <note n="‖" place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 24. <hi>of his Narrative.</hi>
               </note>, <hi>That if he had been abſolved after the Murther of Sir</hi> Edmond-Bury Godfry, <hi>as</hi> Hill, <hi>and his other Accomplices in it were, that he ſhould have probably perſiſted in avowing his</hi>

               <hi>Innocence, as they did, and never, or without extream difficulty have been brought to any acknowledgment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Agreeable to this is that which is ſaid by <hi>Lud. Lopez,</hi> 1. <hi>p. Inſtruct. c.</hi> 42. who is quoted as good Authority by <hi>Raynaudus</hi> the Jeſuit, <hi>ut ſupra. A Woman that hath been falſe to her Husband, doth ſin, if ſhe without cauſe doth ſwear that ſhe is Innocent, and doth ſo ſwear becauſe ſhe hath done Penance for the ſame; unleſs her Husband doth unjuſtly compel her to ſwear.</hi> The meaning of which is, that if ſhe doth ſwear it vainly, when not put to it, and there is no reaſon for it, then ſhe offends; but if her Husband threatens, and ſhe is in danger (for that is often the meaning of <hi>unjuſtly</hi> in the ſence of theſe Caſuiſts) then ſhe may ſafely ſwear that ſhe is Innocent, foraſmuch as ſhe hath repented, and given ſatisfaction to the Prieſt, and been Abſolved by him.</p>
            <p>From whence it appears, that if perſons be compelled to ſwear unjuſtly, as (in their opinion they all are when made to ſwear before Hereticks) that then they may ſwear, though never ſo Guilty, that they are Innocent and without fault, as having been Abſolved for it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. They may plead their own Innocency, and juſtify it with an Oath, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if they ſtand charged before an incompetent Authority. Of this Opinion is <hi>Parſons,</hi> for he ſaith, <note n="a" place="margin">

            <p>And if they may thus ſtand upon their own Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, how unjuſtifiable ſoever their caſe be in it ſelf, before incompetent Authority; then they may as well do it before incompetent Witneſſes and Auditors. For

If we reflect upon theſe Propoſitions, we may be able to reconcile all that Mr. <hi>Whitebread</hi> and his Brethren did declare at their late Execution, or whatever they are made to ſay in theſe Speeches that paſs up and down in their Names, to the juſtice of the Sentence they ſuffered by. It's true, amongſt Proteſtants, nay amongſt Heathens, ſuch ſolemn Proteſtations would be hearkned to; and thoſe that are honeſt and ſincere, could hardly think thoſe that uſe ſuch Aſſeverations to be otherwiſe. But if we conſider what hath been before ſaid, we have reaſon to judg of <hi>Them</hi> by other meaſures. For ſome of their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples do ſhew that they may do it. As thoſe of being diſpenſed with in it; and of having Abſolution after it; and of denying and ſwearing, with Reſervation before an incompetent Authority. But others of the aboveſaid Principles make it neceſſary, and ſhew that they ought to do it. As if they were required ſo to do by their Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors, whoſe Commands they are not to queſtion or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute: If it were for a notable Good, or preventing a conſiderable Miſchief; or if they heard it in Confeſſion; In theſe caſes they are obliged to deny, and to deny a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; to equivocate upon Equivocation; to die, and, I had almoſt ſaid, to damn themſelves, rather than confeſs when they are thus bound to be ſecret.</p>
            <p>But that they need not fear, for beſides the ſecurity that they have otherwiſe, it's ſaid, in a famous Book of theirs, <note n="*" place="margin">

That there is in the moſt material parts of them ſuch an agreement, and that in the phraſe it ſelf, (as hath been already obſerved) as if they were to act a preſcribed part, and to obſerve particular Orders in what they ſhould ſay. (3.) That the Elder, and thoſe who it's likely were to give abſolution, ſpake with greater caution and reſervedneſs, whilſt the others ſpoke with greater freedom and boldneſs. (4.)

               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:106692:11"/>

And that which doth more diſcover the impoſture is, ſince <hi>Aquaviva</hi> is there made to ſay, That he was troubled <hi>that he knew nothing of this before;</hi> which how unlikely it is, will be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, if it be conſidered, that it was about ſeven years betwixt the firſt publiſhing of this Book of <hi>Mariana,</hi> and this Letter ſaid to be written by <hi>Aquaviva;</hi> the Book being licenſed <hi>Decemb.</hi> 1598, and printed at <hi>Toledo</hi> 1599, and the Letter was written 1606. Now that their General ſhould be ſo long ignorant of a Book written by one of their Order, and by ſo learned a Man as <hi>Mariana,</hi> and a Book that had ſet the World
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:106692:12"/>
in a flame, cannot be conceived. But indeed I do not find this Cenſure at <hi>Paris</hi> much inſiſted upon by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And the recalling of it is much like the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, for beſides that Edition at <hi>Toledo,</hi> there was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at <hi>Mentz</hi> by <hi>Balthazar Lippius,</hi> which the Jeſuits there did reviſe ſheet by ſheet; not to ſpeak of that printed at <hi>Frankford</hi> by the Heirs of <hi>Wechelus,</hi> which a Learned Perſon ſaith they did by the inſtruction of a famous Jeſuit <note n="c" place="margin">Caſauboni <hi>Epiſt. ad</hi> Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caeum, p. 48.</note>.</p>
            <p>But however <hi>the principles of it are expugned and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured,</hi> ſaith Mr. <hi>Gawen.</hi> I will take that at the preſent for granted, which an Author of theirs ſaith <note n="d" place="margin">
                  <hi>Eudaem Joh. ad Amic. c.</hi> 1.</note>, <hi>viz.</hi> That upon a Conſultation of the Jeſuits at <hi>Rome,</hi> their General <hi>Aquaviva,</hi> made a Decree, whereby he forbad <hi>to teach, either by Word or Writing, that it was lawful for any perſon whatſoever under any pretext of Tyranny, to kill Kings, or to plot their Death.</hi> A Decree that looks ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſpeciouſly; but (1.) we are here to obſerve, That there is no cenſure of what hath been already written or taught, or the perſons ſo writing or teaching. (2.) We may very well ſuppoſe that the <hi>any perſon whatſoever,</hi> will admit of their common limitation, and is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of any private perſon, that doth it <hi>without the command or ſentence of the Judg,</hi> according to the words of the Decree of the Council at <hi>Conſtance</hi>

There is no little exception to be taken againſt the word <hi>King,</hi> as it's here laid; for in their ſence, an Heretical, Excommunicated and Depoſed
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:106692:12"/>
King, is no King; and he only is with them a King that is not under ſuch a cenſure, and ſo the killing of ſuch an one only is to be declared againſt. (4.) And this we may be the more aſſured of, ſince it's ſaid only <hi>under any pretext of Tyranny;</hi> but it's not ſaid under any pretext of Herefie, Excommunication or Depoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. So that after all, here is no ſecurity for a King, if an Heretick; or for a Catholick King, if Depoſed or Excommunicated: And the Doctrine is ſtill left much where it was before the Decree. So that this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the like Cenſure given by the Abbot <hi>Sylvius</hi> of that before ſpoken of, that <hi>it's a Cenſure full of Equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations and doubtful Expreſſions</hi>

               <note n="n" place="margin">For he is ſaid by <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gambe</hi> to be the Author of <hi>Amphitbeat. Honor.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Gretſer, Beca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) They again are of his Opinion, that do hold, not only that a King may be depoſed by a Prince or People; but that alſo, when depoſed, he is no King. So <hi>Suarez</hi> 
               <note n="o" place="margin">
                  <hi>Defenſ. Fid. l.</hi> 6. <hi>c</hi> 4. Sect. 4. <hi>&amp;</hi> 18.</note>, <hi>When a King is depoſed, then he is neither lawful King nor Prince.</hi> So <note n="p" place="margin">

            <p n="3">
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:106692:13"/>
(3) They are of <hi>Mariana</hi>'s Opinion, that hold a Depoſed King may be killed. So <hi>Leſſius</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Ibid.</note>, <hi>Any having authority, may, if a Prince</hi>'s <hi>Tyranny grow intolerable, Depoſe him,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>whereby any thing may be attempted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Perſon, becauſe he then is no more a Prince.</hi> So <hi>Becanus</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">
                  <hi>Controv. Ang.</hi> p. 115.</note>, <hi>The Pope may deprive Princes, and if contumacious, he may have them deprived of their Life.</hi> So <hi>Suarez</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Ibid. ut prius.</note>, <hi>Eman. Sa</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">Aphor. Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannus.</note>, <hi>Molina,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) They are of his Opinion, that ſay, A private perſon may kill a King ſo Depoſed; <hi>The Sentence being iſſued out, any one may be the Executioner of it.</hi> So <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. Sa</hi> 
               <note n="d" place="margin">Ibid.</note>; ſo <hi>Molina</hi> 
               <note n="e" place="margin">
                  <hi>De Inſtit. Tom.</hi> 4. <hi>Tract.</hi> 3. <hi>Diſp.</hi> 6. <hi>Sect.</hi> 2.</note>. <hi>The People may Depoſe their King, and puniſh him when he is depoſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that we ſee <hi>Mariana</hi> is ſtill a Jeſuit, and they have no Reaſon to clamour againſt him, and to cry out of the <hi>raſhneſs of one man,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Gawen</hi> doth, when as it's the prevailing Opinion amongſt them; and it is diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuouſly done of them, to do by him as the Deer by one that is wounded, clear themſelves of his Company, when he is of the ſame Herd with them.</p>
            <p>Indeed after all that Mr. <hi>Gawen</hi> hath ſaid towards the Vindication of himſelf and his Order, he hath ſaid but what <hi>Mariana</hi> did before him; for <hi>Mariana</hi> held, as I have before ſhewed, That it's not lawful for a private perſon to kill a King; and therefore ſaith, <note n="‖" place="margin">
                  <hi>Cap.</hi> 6. <hi>fin.</hi>
               </note> That <hi>John</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> was condemned by the Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> becauſe he cauſed <hi>Lewis</hi> Duke of <hi>Orleance</hi> to be killed, <hi>Non expectata Sententia Superioris, without at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the Sentence of a Superior,</hi> as the Pope, <hi>i. e.</hi> he did it upon his own head, and out of private Revenge. And if this be the meaning of Mr. <hi>Gawen,</hi> which is the received Sence of thoſe of his Order, we are much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden to him. For then our Prince is left to the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Pope's Bull, or that of the People; for as ſoon
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:106692:14"/>
as he is by them declared againſt, or is an Heretick, or grows intolerable, or is depoſed, then any private Man is the Miniſter of Juſtice, and doth right to God and his Church, or the People, if he kill him. If Mr. <hi>Gawen</hi> had meant honeſtly, he ſhould have told us that it was not his Opinion, that a King may be Depoſed, or that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Depoſition he is no King, and that tho thus depoſed it was unlawful for any Perſon whatſoever to attempt his life. But as long as he uſeth the current phraſe among them, we muſt take their Interpretation of it alſo; and then he muſt ſay any private Perſon may kill a King in the Circumſtances before ſpoken of; ſo that a King is only ſecur'd againſt private Revenge, or the preſent rage of his Subjects; but if they have Warrant for ſo doing from the Pope or People, then Lord have mercy on him, for he is like to find none from them.</p>
            <p>So that after all his renouncing of Equivocation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he in his <hi>laſt dying</hi> words is found baſely to Equivocate, whilſt he neither tells us what the King is whom a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſon ought not to kill, nor what that private perſon is, that ought not to kill him. And when if he means according to the ſtile of his Order, it is no more but that whilſt a lawful King is not Excommunicate, an Heretick, or depoſed, no one may kill him: and when he is either of thoſe, no one of a private revenge or malice may be allowed ſo to do: But if the publick good be concerned in it, or there be Authority or Commiſſion from Superiors [that is, Pope or People in Parliament] then the private perſon is no private perſon, and there is no bar to ſecure a Prince's life from the Aſſaults even of ſuch.</p>
            <p>And if there be ſuch a notorious Equivocation in this ſo ſet a performance of his; and that he acted ſo conformably to his own Principles, of obeying his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:106692:14"/>
in whatever they commanded, in denying what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may be to the prejudice of their Cauſe or Party, in uſing mental reſervations, even whilſt he renounced them, for theſe and the other ends before ſpoken of; what hinders but we are to think that all the reſt wrote after the ſame Copy with him; as when they ſay that <hi>they are as innocent as the Child unborn, of treaſonable crimes;</hi> is not this reconcileable to the principles of Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Abſolution? (which laſt they might, and it's probable did give one to another) Is it not reconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Excommunication and Depoſition of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Majeſty, and to the Title which the Pope chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengeth to theſe Kingdoms, by the ancient claim of Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render? When they ſpeak of the King, might they not apply it either to the Pope or a Succeſſor, doing therein much as a certain Prieſt did, that when asked who was Supream in all Cauſes in the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> preſently anſwered the King, meaning thereby the King of Heaven, as he afterward Expounded it? <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Abbot. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilog. cap.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 12. <hi>b.</hi>
               </note> When they do declare againſt a Plot for the Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Government, is not that eaſily applied to the kind or form, or ſome main parts of it? When they renounce Equivocations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Did not <hi>Garnet</hi> and <hi>Coome</hi> do the ſame, and yet in the mean while did Equivocate or Lye? Did they do all this at their Death, and call God to Witneſs, and pawn their Souls to verifie and confirm what they ſaid? Is this more than what was practiſed by Mr. <hi>Treſham</hi> and <hi>Gurphy;</hi> and what is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently done by Villains at their Execution without ſuch Reaſons for it from Religion or Intereſt as theſe Men had? When I read their Speeches, I can hardly but believe them; When I think of their Accuſations, their Principles, and the Practices uſual amongſt them, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to tremble: To think that at ſuch a time, and in ſo
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:106692:15"/>
great a caſe as this is, men ſhould prevaricate, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the World, care not what becomes of their own Souls; or elſe that they can be ſo ſtupid as to think that the Salvation of their Souls can be conſiſtent with ſuch Impieties. I queſtion not but that time will make this as clear as the day, and then what they did to ſtrengthen their Cauſe, will be the greateſt blow to it that perhaps it ever yet had. When it ſhall be upon record, and publiſhed before all the World, That ſo good may come of it, the good of their Church and Order, they care not what Evil they do, nor how they Subvert the Laws of God and Nature, ſo they may eſtabliſh their own.</p>
