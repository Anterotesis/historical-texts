            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Must Confess, that when the Act of Parliament Injoyned the Clergy to take an Oath of Fidelity to our unquestionably Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Soveraigns, Their Sacred Majesties King <hi>WILLIAM</hi> and Queen <hi>MARY</hi>; my self and your other Fellow-bowlers upon <hi>Yarmouth-Green,</hi> were under a Jealousie, that you would, by refusal of that Oath, have spoiled the old Proverb, and parted the honest Man from the good Bowler; but seeing that the Biass of your Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest wrought your Conscience to Compliance in that point, it hath been an amazement to your Friends, that you having left us near a Year since, with promise to come back within a very few weeks, any such Rub could come in your way, as to stop your return to us; and that we never received any Letter from you, nor knew how to direct to you, till now; that yours which I received this day Sennight tells us, that you have constantly Lodg'd at Dr. <hi>Hollingworth</hi>'s, and had been engaged with him in a business of <hi>a Close and Comfortable Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,</hi> of which we should be farther informed by the return of our next Carrier; Now we all remembred that <hi>Comfortable Importance,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your Admired Dr. <hi>Sam. Parker</hi>'s refined way of expressing it, meant <hi>a Mistress</hi>; but when we do daily see here, your vertuous and well-deserving Wife, and hopeful Children, we were utterly at a loss how to understand you, till the Carrier brought us this last <hi>Tues<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi> the Two Books, Entituled, Dr. <hi>Hollingworth</hi>'s <hi>Defence of King Charles the First against</hi> Ludlow, <hi>and of his Holy and Divine Book against Dr.</hi> Walker<hi>'s rude and undutiful Assaults</hi>; to the Compileing whereof, you say you had not a little Contributed.</p>
            <p>In truth (Sr,) till now, at some times I suspected that you had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented (as other frail Clergy-men have done before you) of the onely good Deed you ever did, I mean your having Sworn to their Majesties, and had unsworn your Oath, and were Caballing with your endear'd
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:65163:3"/>
Friends, the <hi>Iacobites</hi>; At other times it ran in my head, that you and the Dr. having been long in most inward Conversation with them, you had redintigrated your selves, and insinuated into those your old Associates, the present <hi>Plotters</hi>; with purpose to search out, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover their horrid design against the invaluable Lives of Their Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties, against our Church and Nation; but your Books have put me out of doubt in the Point; and as you requested, I have given them a reading, and had now presented you with some Transient Remarks upon them both, but to my great Content I find that <hi>Ludlow</hi> by a Letter to the Dr. (a Copy whereof was sent to a Friend here) hath in great part prevented me, however I shall make some general Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations upon both these famous Tracts, and then speak more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to that which rudely traduces the Memory of the most pious Dr. <hi>Wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ker.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Arrogance which runs through both these Books is insupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the Author boasting proudly of himself, vilifying and censuring others to such a degree, that nothing is more like it than the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebanks, who after a deal of Scaffold Pageantry to draw Audience, entertain them by decrying all others, with a Panegyrick of their own Balsam: All his Arguing is frivolous and trivial, and tho he knows or should know that the Rhetorick of Barking, never moved any man, he writes as tho he had ingross'd all the Ammunition of Railing; he appears as serious as a mad-man, and answers demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with <hi>the Lye</hi>; 'tis surely the highest indecorum for a Divine to write in such a stile as this, and methinks if our Author had any spark of vertue unextinguished, he should upon considering these things retire to his Closet and there lament and pine away for his desperate folly, for the eternal shame to which he has hereby condemned his own Memory. His Friends should give him good Counsel before his understanding be quite unsettled; or if there be none nere, the Neighbours should be called in, and a Parson sent for, to perswade him in time, and not let it run on thus, till he is fit for no place but <hi>Bedlam</hi>: nothing will serve him but he must be a Mad-man in Print, and write in Defence of a King, and that at such a rate, that if he were alive he would be out of love with himself; he hath, like those frightful Looking-Glasses made for sport, represented his Idolized Saint in such bloated Lineaments, (as I am confident) if he could see his face in it, he would break the Glass. But to pretermit his defence against <hi>Ludlow,</hi> I descend to make a few brief Animadversions upon his Treatise against Dr. <hi>Walker,</hi> wherein I discern all along the footsteps
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:65163:3"/>
of a most inveterate and implacable Malice. However, I am obliged to handle it with the more tenderness, in respect to the venerable Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence the Title-page shews in these words, <hi>Imprimatur</hi> Carol. Alston, <hi>R P. D.</hi> Hen. <hi>Episc.</hi> Lond. <hi>à Sacris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the discharge of my Undertaking, I shall in the first place take leave to recount the heads of some of those proofs, offer'd by Dr. <hi>Walker,</hi> to demonstrate that Dr. <hi>Gauden,</hi> and not King <hi>Charles</hi> was the Author of the Idolized Book, called <hi>Eicon Basilice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>This good Man in his Introduction saith, that Dr. <hi>Hollingworth</hi> did put him upon that unwelcome labour by falsely accusing him of telling a false story, without consulting him by word or letter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he did it, and that he was constrained by unavoidable necessity (unless that Doctor expected that as a <hi>Felo de se,</hi> he should by silence give consent to his unjust Calumnies) to vindicate himself; And he declares his resolution to keep that modest temper, which becomes one who designs no personal Quarrel; nor writes for Victory but Truth, The search and discovery of which needs no Tricks, no little Arts, no big Words; but is best attained by sedate proceedings and plain and open dealing. And <hi>he solemnly Appeals to the Searcher of Hearts, Avenger of Falshood, and Revealer of Secrets, that he will write nothing of the Truth of which he is not throughly perswaded.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <q>1. He Asserts (page 4<hi>th</hi>) that Dr. <hi>Gauden,</hi> some time before the Book was finished, acquainted him with his design, and shewed him the heads of diverse Chapters, and some of the discourses written of hem; and asked his Opinion concerning it; who told him he suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed it would be much for the King's Reputation, Honour and Safety; but added he st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ck at the lawfulness of it, and asked him how he satisfyed himself so to impose upon the World? To which Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> so readily replyed, that he concluded he had thought of it before; <hi>look on the Title, 'tis the Portra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <q>2. That some good time after, Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> being with Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> he went with him to Dr. <hi>Duppa</hi> Bishop of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and in the way thither, Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> told him that he was going to the Bishop (whom he had acquainted with his design) to fetch what he had left with him to be perused; or to shew him what he had farther written; that the Bishop had some private Discourse with Dr. <hi>Gauden,</hi> who, in their return told Dr. <hi>W.</hi> that the Bish. said there were two Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects more, which he wished he had thought on, and propounded them to him, <hi>viz. The Ordinance against the Common-Prayer-Book, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying

his Majesty the Attendance of his Chaplains</hi>; (which are now the 16th and 24th Chapters in the Printed Book) and desired Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> to write two Chapters upon them, which he said he promised he would, but before they parted, the Bishop recalled that request, and said, pray go you on, to finish what remains, and leave these two to me, I will prepare two Chapters upon them; which he accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly did, as Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> owned to Dr. <hi>Walker,</hi> and others whom he had made privy to the whole, and never pretended to have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten these, as he did to have done all the rest.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <q>3. That Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> some time after the King was Murdered, upon Dr. <hi>Walker</hi>'s asking him, whether the King had ever seen the Book, answered, that he did not certainly know; but he used his best en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours that he might, for he delivered a Copy of it to the Marquess of <hi>Hertford,</hi> when he went to the Treaty at the Isle of <hi>Wight,</hi> and entreated him to deliver it to his Majesty, and humbly desire to know his pleasure concerning it: But the Violence which threatned the King hastning so fast, he ventured to Print it, and never knew what was the Issue of sending it; for when the thing was done, he judged it not prudent to make farther noise about it by enquiry.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="4">
               <q>4. That Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> asked Dr. <hi>Gauden,</hi> whether King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second knew that he wrote it; he answered, I cannot positively and certainly say he doth, because he was never pleased to take express notice of it to me, But I take it for granted he doth, for <hi>I am sure the Duke of</hi> York <hi>doth,</hi> for he hath spoken of it to me, and owned it as a seasonable and acceptable Service; and he knowing it, I questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on not but the King also doth.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="5">
               <q>5. That Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi>'s Wife, some others, and Dr. <hi>Walker,</hi> believed it as much as they could believe any thing; and when they spake of it in his presence, or in his absence, did it without the least doubt of his having writ it; being as much assured of it, as twas possible they could be of any matter of Fact; And there is no shadow of Appearance, why he should put so gross a cheat upon them all; for 'twas before it was finished, and a good while before 'twas Printed, they so believed; and therefore he had not the Temptation to steal the Applause it met with when made publick.</q>

That Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> delivered to Dr. <hi>Walker,</hi> with his own hand, what was last sent up, (after part was Printed, or at least in Mr. <hi>Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston</hi>'s hands to be Printed) and after he had shew'd it him, and Seal'd it up, gave him strict Caution with what Wariness to carry and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver it, and according to his direction he delivered it, <hi>Saturday</hi> 23<hi>d</hi> of
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:65163:4"/>
                  <hi>December</hi> 1648 in the Evening to one <hi>Peacock,</hi> who was instructed by what hands he should transmit it to Mr. <hi>Royston</hi>; and in the same method a few days after, the Impression was finished, and Dr <hi>Walker</hi> received six Books, by the hand of <hi>Peacock,</hi> as an acknowledgment of the little he had Contributed to that Service; one of which he affirmed he had still by him, at the time of his writeing this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>To these reasons Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> adds (page 7.) that
he meets with Expressions in the devotional part, very frequently used by Dr. <hi>Gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> in his Prayers (for he used Conceived Prayer both in his Family and in Publick) which he never heard from any other man.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now Sr. you are not to take these things which I have transcrib'd, to be the Sum total of what Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> offers to evince, that Dr. <hi>Gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> was the Author of the Book we are talking of; he lays down ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Arguments of mighty weight in the point, to which I must refer you, and shall onely tell you that he concludes his modest Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this matter, in these words,
<q>These are the Reasons why I believe as I do, the Affirmative part of the Question, that Dr.<hi>Gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> was the Author, and <hi>as I believe I have also spoken.</hi> And if any Man can produce stronger Reasons for the Negative part, I do not say only I will, but that I must believe that contrary part; for <hi>no Man who Considers, can believe as he lists,</hi> but the weightiest Arguments will turn the Scale.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>And if any Man will be so Charitable as to reclaim me from an Error, he supposes I am in; <hi>I even beseech him to write nothing for the Truth, of which he does not make the like Appeals to God which I have done</hi>; for if he attempts it by <hi>Railery,</hi> or <hi>Railing,</hi> by feeble Conjectures or Stories inconsistent with themselves, or contradicting one another, <hi>he may with more discretion spare his pains</hi>; for, as no wise man will be influenced farther by such Tools, than to pitty them who use them, or make themselvrs merry, so I confess I am so tired with examining such Ware, and so cloyed with such <hi>Quelk-chose,</hi> I shall have no sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack to such Fare, or think my self concern'd to take notice of it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I come now Sr. to Consider Dr. <hi>Hollingworth</hi>'s Answer to Dr. <hi>Walker,</hi> and before I enter upon his Arguments, I desire you to smell to a Nose-gay of Flowers, which I have gather'd out of the Garden of <hi>Their Majesties Chaplain at Ald-gate.</hi> His <hi>Title-page</hi> terms the Reverend Dr. <hi>Walker</hi>'s Assertions, <hi>Rude and undutiful Assaults.</hi>

               <pb n="ix" facs="tcp:65163:5"/>Thus, <hi>Sir,</hi> hath your Host at <hi>Aldgate,</hi> (whose Mouth wants scowring) unloaded his Lay-stall; and how justly these vile Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies might be retorted upon him who utters them, let the World judg. But I shall not rake further in this Dunghil; 'tis most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that an ill Man cannot by praising, confer Honour, nor by reproaching, fix an Ignominy. The late Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> had such a Stock of solid and deserving Reputation, that it is more than a wild rambling Slanderer can spoil or deface, by all his Revilings; he was such a judicious, conscientious, learned and sincere Protestant, so true a Son of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that had this <hi>hot-headed Turn-coat</hi> had any Modesty, he would have blush'd to reproach and load him with Contempt, Malice and Obloquy: but vile and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solent Language costs him nothing, and therefore he has laid it on so prodigally.</p>
            <p>I am now to look a little farther into the <hi>Aldgate</hi> Doctor's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of that which he will call the King's Book, against the <hi>Essex</hi> Doctor's Assaults, that I may shew you how he hath left Matters standing between him and his Adversary.</p>
            <p>He saith, <hi>(pag.</hi> 2.) <hi>It was for his Holy and Divine Book, that that great King was so highly venerated, so deservedly applauded; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed upon the score of which the greatest part of his Actions were vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated; and therefore this Book must be considered and weighted in a just and proper Ballanse,</hi> (indeed so it ought.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Page</hi> 5. he tells us, and who may question it? that what Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> asserts of Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi>'s writing the Book, is <hi>all Sham; and that if he had dared to have told such a Falshood, he must have sat down contented with his Living at</hi> Barking, <hi>without any Expectation from the Court; without either being Bishop of</hi> Exeter, <hi>or living in hopes of the Bishoprick of</hi> Winchester.</p>
            <p>Now who will doubt Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi>'s having possessed the fat Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of <hi>Barking?</hi> But 'tis all Sham, he was no more Incumbent there, than Dr. <hi>Hollingworth</hi> was in the See of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> the First. How then should it happen that he talks of <hi>Barking?</hi> I was thinking that he pitch'd upon it, in regard of its near resemblance to <hi>Railing,</hi> which has sometimes proved a good Living to an Ecclesiastical Wrangler. But upon second Thoughts I consider, that the Town of <hi>Barking</hi> is but seven Miles from <hi>London,</hi> and contiguous to the small Vicarage of <hi>West-Ham,</hi> which the <hi>Aldgate</hi> Doctor once possessed; and learning there, that <hi>Barking</hi> was a plump Parsonage of four or five hundred Pounds a
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:65163:6"/>
Year, his Ambition might lead him to set his Heart upon it; and his Brain being now crack'd at the Disappoinment, he talks of it at the rate, which we have seen a distracted Lover in <hi>Bedlam</hi> speaking of his hard-hearted Mistress. But it seems <hi>one Falshood</hi> would have dash'd all Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi>'s Hopes of Preferment; I say then, Alas poor Dr. <hi>Hollingworth</hi>! you must sit down contented with your Chaplainship at <hi>Aldgate</hi> of 8 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> without any expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Barking,</hi> (though it is in their Majesties Gift) or of any other Promotion from the Court; for before I have done, I shall demonstrate, that <hi>your whole Book is but one huge Lie,</hi> 27 <hi>Pages long.</hi>

               <hi>Page</hi> 6. the Doctor repeats his old Story of a worthy Person, Sir <hi>Iohn Brattle</hi>'s informing him,
<q>That in the Year 1647, the King having drawn up the most considerable part of this Book in loose Papers, desired Bishop <hi>Iuxon</hi> to get some trusty Friend to look it over, and put it into exact Method. And the Bishop pitch'd upon Sir <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Father; who undertaking the Task, was assisted by this his Son, who sat up some Nights with his Father to assist him in methodizing these Papers, <hi>all writ with the King's own Hand.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>You shall see what Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> said in this Point;
<q>I make no Judgment (saith he, <hi>pag.</hi> 19.) prejudicial, or of disadvantage to the Character here given of Sir <hi>Iohn Brattle</hi>; but with due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to him, I would ask the Doctor of few Questions.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <q>1. May it not be possible, without any diminution of Sir <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Veracity, that in more than 40 Years, there may be some mistake of other Papers for these, or some other lapse of Memory, about a Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in which he was concerned but once or twice, and that but transiently, and on the bye? Or was Sir <hi>Iohn,</hi> who must be then a young Man, and, 'tis likely, but in a private Capacity, so well acquainted with the King's Hand, which 'tis probable he had seldom or never seen? I believe few Country Youths, or young Gentlemen, are so very well used to their Sovereign's Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing, as to make a critical Judgment of it, and to be able with assurance to distinguish it from the Writing of all other Men.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Further; supposing, but by no means granting, that the King desired Bishop <hi>Iuxon,</hi> as is said, to desire a trusty Friend to do it: Why another rather than the Bishop himself? Had the King any Friend more trusty than Bishop <hi>Iuxon?</hi> Or was he too good, or above doing such Service for his Master, who had not a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:65163:6"/>
who loved or honoured him more? Or was he too busy to attend it, when he was wholly out of all Employment, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd the most undisturbed Privacy and Quiet of any Man that had serv'd the King in any eminent Degree? Or was Bishop <hi>Iuxon</hi> less sit and able than a private Man, when the Book consists of Policy and Piety? And who a sitter Judg of what concerned the first, than one who had so long been a Privy-Counsellor, and Lord-High-Treasurer of <hi>England?</hi> And for the second, he was one on whom the King relied, as much or more than on any Man, for the conduct of his Conscience, as appeared by his singling him out, to be with him in his preparations for Death. And why must Bishop <hi>Iuxon</hi> desire another Man to do that Work, for which (had there been any such Work to be done) he was the fittest Man alive, for Fidelity, for Ability, for Inclination to his Master's Service, and for vacancy and leisure?</q>
            </p>
            <p>Let's soe now what Answers their Majesty's Chaplain at <hi>Aldgate</hi> makes to these plain Questions, for we find him vaunting, (<hi>pag.</hi> 22.) That <hi>he hath made out Matter of Fact against Dr.</hi> Walker<hi>'s Assertions, in his vain, shuffling, proud and inconsistent Book.</hi> Why all that the <hi>Aldgate</hi> Doctor saith hereunto is, (<hi>pag.</hi> 9.)
<q>He (Dr. <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi>) questions Sir <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Memory, and talks of his Youth, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>validate the Story; but that is <hi>so great an Affront to all the young Gentlemen and Apprentices in</hi> London, <hi>who at the Age of Nineteen, are so very much imployed and trusted in their Master's Books and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts,</hi> that I leave them to vindicate Sir <hi>Iohn,</hi> upon the score of helping his Father <hi>in a thing of such a Nature as this was,</hi> at such an Age.</q>
            </p>
            <p>What ridiculous Stuff is this? 'Tis such an inexcusable Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front to the <hi>London</hi> Apprentices, to say, That though they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand their Master's Account-Books, they have not at Nineteen, the necessary qualifications of States-men and Divines, that they must be instigated to draw up an Abhorrence against it; and it may be this Doctor, who would cokes them to fall upon Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> as their common Enemy, designs them <hi>a Venison Feast</hi> this Season; but (should he do it) I advise you, as his Friend, to caution him to appoint it at some other place than <hi>Merchant-Taylors Hall,</hi> in regard Dr. <hi>Meriton</hi> lives opposite to it; and it may be some dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution to his Credit, if that Reverend Divine should take the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to cross the Street, and tell him, in the midst of his Jol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:65163:7"/>
with the Lads, that he hath twice belied him in his malicious Scriblings against Dr. <hi>Walker.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Aldgate</hi> Doctor (<hi>pag.</hi> 9.) dismisses Sir <hi>Iohn Brattle,</hi> saying, And <hi>this is all I have to say as to Sir</hi> John Brattle; <hi>and that he told me this, I will depose upon Oath, whenever I am lawfully RECAL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LED.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have heard of <hi>Re-ordaining, Recanting,</hi> and <hi>Re-recanting</hi>; and it is more than probable, that this Learned Gentleman understands the meaning of these words; but 'tis beyond my Capacity to make sense of <hi>Recalling</hi> in this place, and he will oblige me in telling me his meaning therein: And to requite the Courtesy, you may tell him, that I will produce good Evidence upon Oath, when <hi>REqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,</hi> (there's a <hi>Re</hi> for his <hi>Re</hi>) that Sir <hi>Iohn Brattle,</hi> who I agree is a very worthy Person, doth declare, That he never told Dr. <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingworth,</hi> or any other Person, that the Papers he spoke of <hi>were writ with the King's own Hand.</hi> Their Majesty's Chaplain may not take it ill, or think that his Veracity is called into Question, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring of Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> about this Matter, for we had his leave to do it, when he asserted the thing, and said, <hi>Thanks be to God, Sir</hi> John <hi>is yet alive, and is ready to give the same Account to any Man that asks him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Aldgate</hi> Doctor affirms, (<hi>pag.</hi> 10.)
<q>That the Reverend Dr. <hi>Meriton</hi> dining the latter end of the last Year with the Lord Mayor, Sir <hi>Thomas Pilkington,</hi> happened to meet with Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> at the same Table; where Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> was pleased <hi>with his usual Confidence,</hi> to assert Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> the Author of the King's Book: Upon which Dr. <hi>Meriton</hi> turned upon him with <hi>the Story of Mr. Simmonds</hi> communicating the whole thing to Dr. <hi>Gauden,</hi> upon which <hi>he was so confounded, that he had nothing to say for himself,</hi> and though if none but Dr. <hi>Meriton</hi> himself had declared to me (quoth he) the Issue of their Debate, it would have satisfied me: yet the further satisfaction I had from my worthy Friend Mr. <hi>Marriot,</hi> then Chaplain to the Lord-Mayor, and Minister of the Parish Church in <hi>Rood-Lane,</hi> who stood by and heard the whole Discourse, and withal the silence he put Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> to; which he professed to my self, gave me so full a satisfaction, that upon that account I ventured to give the World an Account of it in print.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now it had been much better either to have let this Story quite alone, or to have given a true Relation of it; but our Author trusts
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:65163:7"/>
to Falshoods more than to the Truth of the Cause; he saith in his Preface, <hi>If any Man questions the Truth of these Living Evidences I have quoted, if he pleases to come to me, I will wait upon him to them, and he shall have satisfaction from themselves of the truth of what I have writ.</hi> I should tell him now, if I did not know him, that he might be ashamed to prevaricate as he doth; but he hath cast off all Shame; he exclaims thus upon Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> (page 20.) <hi>Well done Dr.</hi> Walker, <hi>if thou ever hadst a Man alone with thee, undoubtedly he was alwaies on thy side, and thou wert always in the right; and when the Man was dead, wouldst assume the confidence to print it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In what words now shall I bespeak Dr. <hi>Hollingworth?</hi> he offers to wait upon any Man who is doubtful in the Matter, to the Persons he names; and yet I am at a certainty that he hath assumed the confidence to put these reverend Divines, Dr. <hi>Meriton</hi> and Mr. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot</hi> (whom he terms his Worthy Friends) in print, (whilst living) without their Privity or Consent, or consulting them of the truth of what he relates; and I am as sure that they will not averr what he asserts they told him; for without putting the Doctor to the trouble of waiting upon him, I engaged a Friend to enquire of these Reverend Persons of the truth of what he writes relating to them; and Dr. <hi>Meriton</hi> saith, that Dr. <hi>Hollingworth</hi> hath commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>two Mistakes</hi> (to give it no harder Name) in the Story; for whereas he affirms that Dr. <hi>Walker, with his usual Confidence,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan the Discourse at my Lord-Mayor's Table, Dr. <hi>Meriton</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, that there was no such Discourse at the Table, but that after Dinner he himself began the Discourse, taking Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> into a Corner of the Room, and Mr. <hi>Marriot</hi> is pleased to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that he did not much observe the Discourse, not charge his Memory with the Particulars thereof, but believes that Dr. <hi>Meriton</hi> began it; and that Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> did assert, in reply to him, that Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> was the Author of the Book. Yet we are to believe, if we please, that poor Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> was confounded and put to silence: but I am sure the <hi>Aldgate</hi> Doctor ought to be so, whose very asserting a thing ought to carry in in self an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Credibility; and from henceforth surely he will be for ever banished from the Society of Learned and Honest Men.</p>
            <p>Where are we next? Dr. <hi>Hollingworth</hi> saith, (<hi>pag.</hi> 9.) <hi>The next thing I shall discourse upon, is the Story of Mr.</hi> Simmonds. Is it so? come then, let me hear it; <hi>A reverend Friend, the Vicar of</hi> Witham <hi>acquainted him where the Widow of Mr.</hi> Simmonds <hi>lived;
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:65163:8"/>
The Doctor went to her, and enquired whether she knew any thing of the King's Book, and how far her Husband was concerned in it? she pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently answer'd the Doctor, that going into her Husband's Study, she saw upon the Table a Book in writing, which she knew was not her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's Hand, and therefore asked him whose it was; but he turned her off, with bidding her mind her own Business.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A doughty Story upon my word; and such a Command as this (<hi>to mind his own Business</hi>) from my Lord Bishop of <hi>London</hi> to our Doctor, might have prevented the blotting of abundance of Paper; but seeing 'tis tumbled out, and that with the License of his Lordship's Chaplain, with a vain imagination that it serves the Cause; I will take the liberty to say, That a Friend of mine, without consulting either the Vicar of <hi>Witham,</hi> or the Vicar of <hi>Gotham</hi> sound, that Mris. <hi>Simmonds</hi> lived with Mr. <hi>Span</hi> in <hi>Creed-lane</hi> near <hi>Black-Fryers</hi>; and he assures me, that upon discourse with her, she appeared to be a very discreet and good Woman, (as in earnest I am assured her Reverend Husband was) and did acknowledg that Dr. <hi>Hollingworth</hi> had been with her; which without further examination of the abovementioned Story, (it deserving no Remark) I will allow to justify the Doctor therein. But (quoth he, <hi>pag.</hi> 11.) <hi>she told me, her Husband never joyed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self after the King's Murther, but fell sick and died the</hi> 29th <hi>of</hi> March <hi>following.</hi> So she told my Friend, but with this difference (as the Doctor knows, but he seems resolved never to tell the Truth, the whole Truth, and nothing but the Truth) that his Sickness whereof he died was <hi>the Small-Pox.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Doctor's next <hi>living Witness</hi> is your honest Name-sake Mr. <hi>Milbourn</hi> the Printer; <hi>he told the</hi> Aldgate <hi>Chaplain</hi> (if a Man may take his word
<q>That in 1648 he was Apprentice to Mr. <hi>Grisman</hi> a Printer; at which time Mr. <hi>Simmonds,</hi> by Mr. <hi>Royston,</hi> sent the King's Book to be Printed, and that his Master did Print it; and that Mr. <hi>Simmonds</hi> alwaies had the Name of sending it to the Press, and that it came to them as from the King.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now though it seems as improbable that a Printer's Apprentice should know the Author of a Book which comes to his Master, through several Hands (as 'tis in this Relation) to be Printed with the greatest privacy, as that those <hi>London</hi> Apprentices who understand the keeping their Master's Accompts, are therefore capable of being Ministers of State: Yet I will not contend this matter with Mr. <hi>Milbourn,</hi> but be it as he saies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xv" facs="tcp:65163:8"/>
               <q>In the next place (<hi>pag.</hi> 13.) I find a Certificate under the Hand of Mr. <hi>Clifford,</hi> who assisted Mr. <hi>Milbourn</hi> in Composing and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting the Book; which backs his Story, with this Addition, that great part of the Book was seized in Mr. <hi>Simmond</hi>'s Lodgings; and he, <hi>though in a Shepherd's Habit,</hi> was so far discovered, as that he was pursued into Great <hi>Carter-Lane,</hi> by the Rebels; where he took Refuge, and <hi>the bloody Villains fired two Pistols at him, which frighted him up Stairs, and out of the Garret-window he made his escape over the Houses.</hi> And he further saith, That he never heard, nay, that <hi>he is sure Dr.</hi> Gauden <hi>never was concerned in that Book,</hi> by which Mr. <hi>Milbourn</hi> and himself printed it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This Certificate, I find, <hi>Sir,</hi> is attested by your self and <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet Hollingworth:</hi> And one of your and my Neighbours, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitive, upon the reading it, to know whether this <hi>Iewel,</hi> for so they say <hi>Margaret</hi> is in the Greek, be the Doctor's Wife or Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? but I could not resolve it.</p>
            <p>Now had Dr. <hi>VValker</hi> been alive, and had <hi>Clifford</hi> made Oath of what he here asserts, I know not but he might have been indicted for Perjury, for saying; That <hi>he is sure Dr.</hi> Gauden <hi>was never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the Book.</hi> And then Dr. <hi>Hollingworth,</hi> who confesses that he procured and penn'd this Certificate, might have been in some danger of an Indictment for Subornation.</p>
            <p>But pray let us compare the Relation of Mr. <hi>Clifford</hi> with that of good Mrs. <hi>Simmonds</hi>; She saith,
<q>That she lodged with her Husband in <hi>Carter-Lane</hi>; and that their Lodgings being discovered, <hi>a Souldier shot a Pistol to mark the Door,</hi>
(the very Expression used by Dr. <hi>VValker</hi> in his Relation of the Story,
<hi>pag.</hi> 30.) but she and her Husband were at that time at Dinner with a Major of the King's, at one Mr. <hi>Chibar</hi>'s a Minister about <hi>Old Fish-street</hi>; and had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice brought thither, that Souldiers had been at their Lodgings; whereupon her Husband went away, bidding her go home: And the Souldiers coming soon after to Mr. <hi>Chibars</hi> his House, the Major made his escape at <hi>a Garret-Window,</hi> before the Door of the House was unlock'd. And she further told my Friend, That till he read it to her out of Dr. <hi>Hollingworth</hi>'s Book, <hi>She never heard of her Husband's going in a Shepherd's Habit.</hi>
               </q>
But when this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter comes to be scrutiniz'd, I foresee that our Doctor will affirm, That by <hi>a Shepherd's Habit,</hi> he only meant <hi>a Gown and Cassock.</hi>

Page</hi> 17. We have the same thing over again in these words; <hi>I say, and will prove it by a better Evidence than Dr.</hi> Walker <hi>can be supposed to be, that Dr.</hi> Gauden, <hi>after he was Bishop of</hi> Exeter, <hi>did justify it to be the King's Book. Page</hi> 18. this celebrated Witness is produced; and our Doctor tells us, 'Tis Mr. <hi>Long,</hi> Prebendary, <hi>as he takes it,</hi> of <hi>Exeter.</hi> And, <hi>page</hi> 20. he thus characterizes him; <hi>I must tell the Reader, that he is an ancient, grave, Reverend Divine, well known for his Truth and Honesty; one, who as he is a professed Member of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>so he hath always been true to the Doctrine and Discipline of it, in his Preaching and Practice; and not like my Adversary, who I know (for I was personally acquainted with him) was an Encourager of, and Comrade, principally with those who had no kindness for the Church at all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I must, with your leave Sir, a little remark upon this most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary and remarkable Man. Dr. <hi>Hollingworth</hi> is, no doubt, sure of the truth of what he saies; we are bound to believe him, though he is not at a certainty what this <hi>Long</hi> is; for he tells us, that he is Prebendary of <hi>Exeter, as he takes it. He hath alwaies been true to the Doctrine and Discipline of the Church of</hi> England. That's indeed something, and makes the <hi>Prebendary</hi> a much more valuable Man than our <hi>Chaplain</hi>; for he, once upon a time declared, that <hi>be thanked God, he had vomited up all his Calvinistical Principles.</hi> Whereupon a Person of true Worth, and of high Desert, repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thus to him; <hi>Then the Doctrine of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>and

            </p>
            <p>But I may not let the <hi>Prebendary</hi> thus slide out of my hands: I have found there's something more than ordinary in the Man, which recommends him to the Doctor's Favour, and I will not withhold it from you.

            <p>But now he falls with a Witness upon poor Dr. <hi>Walker,</hi> saying, (<hi>page</hi> 22.) <hi>I have a Commission from the present Bishop of</hi> Gloucester, <hi>Dr.</hi> Fowler, <hi>to present the World with this Narrative attested by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, which has a great deal in it, considering the former Testimonies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The former Testimonies, indeed considered (which have nothing in them but Falshood, and empty or angry Words) I must allow that there is something in this, though not to the Doctor's Purpose: We have here a Certificate attested by my Lord Bishop of <hi>Gloucester,</hi> which fills almost three Pages, with most undoubted Truth; and this must be esteemed something, and 'tis a rare thing too; for (this Relation excepted) a Man may aver that there is scarce a Paragraph in their Majesties Chaplain's seven and twenty Pages without a Falshood. It behoves then that we look into this Narrative: The Sum of it is this.</p>

                     </gap>eighly,</hi> a very Religious and Pious Gentlewoman, told Dr. <hi>Fowler,</hi> that a Captain of the Parliament Army told her, that being appointed to stand every Morning at his Majesty's Bed-Chamber Door, when he was a Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in the <hi>Isle of Wight,</hi> he observed, for several days, that he went into his Closet, and there staid a considerable time, and then went into the Garden: And the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain perceiving that <hi>he still left the Key in the Closet Door,</hi> he went in, and found that the King had been penning most Devout and Pious Meditations and Prayers, which the Captain read for several Mornings together. And Mrs. <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>And I am very inclinable to be of good Mrs. <hi>Keighley</hi>'s Mind; and yet this Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth more serve Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> than Dr. <hi>Hollingworth.</hi> It must be remembred that the <hi>Essex</hi> Doctor asserts that Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> sent a Copy of the Book by the Marquess of <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rtford</hi> to the King, when a Prisoner in the <hi>Isle of Wight,</hi> and that he believes it was corrected by his Majesty. The Design of the Book was, <hi>ad Captandum Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum</hi>; and this King was no Fool I assure you: He spent some time every Morning
<pb n="xix" facs="tcp:65163:10"/>
in perusing and making such Alterations and Emendations as he thought fit in the Papers, and then took his walk, leaving the Key in his Closet-Door, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Papers upon the Table, as a Bait to catch the Captain; for though, as the <hi>Aldgate</hi> Chaplain most wittily express'd himself, Some Birds are not to be catch'd with Chaff, yet some may: And so I think the Mystery is unriddled.</p>
            <p>And now, that I may take a full revenge upon the Doctor, I fall upon him with the But-end of another Bishop; 'tis Dr. <hi>Nicholson</hi> who was Bishop of <hi>Gloucester</hi> at the time when the Widow of Dr. <hi>Gauden,</hi> after her Husband's Death, resided in that City: This Bishop understanding that Mrs. <hi>Gauden</hi> did declare that her Husband wrote the King's Book, and desiring to be fully satisfied in that Point, did put the Question to her, upon her receiving the Sacrament; and she then affirmed, that it was wrote by her Husband. For the Truth of this, I can appeal to Persons of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Credit now living in <hi>Gloucester</hi>; and I am under no doubt but my Lord Bishop of <hi>Gloucester</hi> that now is, will acknowledg that those Persons have related this Matter to him, as I have now told it. And I do as certainly know that there is a Person of Quality and clear Reputation, who was Mrs. <hi>Gauden</hi>'s Brother, now living, that will affirm that his Sister did constantly in her Conversation with him, declare that her Husband was the Author of that Book: And the same thing is well known to several of her Relations now in being.</p>
            <p>I shall now hasten to an end, when I have related a Story which agrees with the Earl of <hi>Anglesey</hi>'s <hi>Memorandum,</hi> and with Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi>'s telling Dr. <hi>Walker,</hi> (as he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts) that the Duke of <hi>York</hi> knew that he was the Author of that Book, and own'd it as a seasonable and acceptable Service. There is now in being a Person of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, in whose hearing the late King <hi>Iames</hi> was highly commending the excellent Language of the present Bishop of <hi>Rochester</hi>'s Book, called, <hi>The Rye-House Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy.</hi> Whereupon this Person took occasion to say, That <hi>his Majesties Father's Book was wrote in an excellent Stile.</hi> To which the King replied, <hi>My Father did not write that Book, it was wrote by Bishop</hi> Gauden. 'Tis very indecent to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Names without Permission; but I will adventure to say, that the Person I mean, either is at present, or lately was one of the <hi>Lords Commissioners of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I observe that Dr. <hi>Hollingworth</hi> never writes a Pamphlet without <hi>a Postscript:</hi> in that against Dr. <hi>Walker,</hi> he tells an idle Story,
<q>That Mrs. <hi>Simmonds</hi> acquainted him, that being at Dinner <hi>some Years since</hi> at a Citizens House, he, like one of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and greedy to lessen Monarchy by aspersing King <hi>Charles,</hi> told her, if she would confess the Truth, that her Husband made the Book called the King's, <hi>there were some hundreds of Pounds at her Service:</hi> which <hi>she scorned,</hi> and <hi>told him, She was not to be bribed by never so much to so great a Lie.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>'Twould be a very seasonable and good Work, to set some body to bribe this prevaricating and forging Doctor to speak Truth. For Mrs. <hi>Simmonds,</hi> who is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientious Woman, denies that she told the Doctor that any Body attempted to bribe her to a Lie, or said to her that there were some hundred Pounds, or any Sum at her Service; but she declares she told him, That quickly after the King<hi>'s</hi> Murder, one Mr. <hi>Robinson,</hi> who lived about <hi>Thredneedle-street,</hi> invited her to Dinner, and talk'd with her about her Husband's writing the King's Book, and said, it might be some hundred Pounds in her way, if she would acknowledg the Truth; and that if she would not, she might come into great trouble; and she saith that she never saw him after.</p>

            <p>'TIS common, <hi>Sir,</hi> to such despicable and malicious Braw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers as you are, to rail at those things most, that are most praise-worthy: I should therefore esteem it scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous to the Glorious Cause and Noble Performances of the most worthy Parliament of <hi>November</hi> 1640, which I have endeavoured to vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dicate, to be commended, and account it a praise to be evil spoken of by you: And it would provoke a Man to laughter to behold you betaking your self to Slanders and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies, to see nothing but Dirt and Filth issuing from your Mouth, when you find your Arguments will little avail.</p>
            <p>I should not give my self the trouble to animadvert upon your Follies and Frenzies, but that I hear you are swollen with Pride and Conceit to an incredible degree.</p>
            <p>I shall therefore shew, that with a great deal of toil you have done just nothing at all; and that you are fallen under a most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious degree of Stupidity and Madness, to take so much pains to make your Folly visible to the World, which till now, you, in some measure, have concealed; to be so industrious to heap Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace upon your self. What Offence does Heaven punish you for, in making you undertake the Defence of so forlorn and desperate a Cause as that of K. <hi>Charles</hi> the First, and that with so much confidence and indiscretion; and instead of defending it, to betray it by your Ignorance?</p>
            <p>It was as truly as ingenuously observed by the Learned Bishop <hi>Burnet,</hi> in his Sermon before the <hi>House of Commons,</hi> Jan. 31. 1688.
<q>That if one were to make a Panegyrick on Tyranny, he ought to turn over all the common Places of Wit, all the Stores of Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the liveliest Figures with which his Fancy would fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish him, to make so odious a thing look but tolerably; and by sacrificing Truth to Interest, and varnishing it over with Wit and Eloquence, he might shew how gracefully he could plead a very ill Cause.</q>
And 'tis certain that most Writers used some endeavour to carry on their Discourses by <hi>a Stream of Sense and Reason</hi>; but
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65163:12"/>
you, <hi>Sir,</hi> have done it by <hi>a Course of Reviling and Railing</hi>; and it may be truly said, That <hi>if the dirty and Tinker-like Names, the scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous and foul-mouth'd Expressions, the spiteful and false Accusations,</hi> (I gather these Expressions from your Book) were taken out of your Pamphlet, it would appear but a poor and shrunken thing, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing to your self when you look upon it, and of small power to work upon others that read it. You seem rather to bawl and hoot at, than to answer my Letter; and your Book is the best <hi>Common-Place</hi> for <hi>Billingsgate</hi> that I have lately seen: But it is well known, that a <hi>Mountebank</hi> can neither draw, nor keep a Croud a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his Stage, without the help of <hi>a witty, or foul-mouth'd Buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foon.</hi> And <hi>the gay Fancy, the cutting Sarcasms,</hi> wherewith your Tract is all-bespatter'd, do adorn and render it highly entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to some Persons. And I must confess, that I find some subtilty in your first setting out, for you begin cunningly, and like an old <hi>Cavalier,</hi> you place the <hi>Right Reverend and pious Bishop</hi> Kidder in the Front of the Battel, just as King <hi>Charles</hi> the First did <hi>the Round-heads,</hi> whom he had taken Prisoners at the Battel of <hi>Edghil</hi>; these (as we find the Relation in <hi>Husband</hi>'s <hi>Exact Collections,</hi> pag. 758.) he set pinion'd in the Front of his Men, when he engaged the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament-Forces at <hi>Braintford,</hi> to be a Breast-work to receive the Bullets that came from the <hi>Brownists and Anabaptists,</hi> (of such the King affirmed the <hi>Parliament Army</hi> to consist) that <hi>the Cavaliers</hi> might escape them. However, <hi>the good Bishop,</hi> I plainly foresee will come off, as every of them did; <hi>he may be shot through the Clothes, but no way hurt.</hi> For <hi>your Quotations</hi> out of the <hi>Sermons</hi> of this good Man, and of that <hi>great and well-studied Divine Dr.</hi> Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock, do only endeavour to aggravate the Iniquity of this Martyr's Murder; whereas there is not one Syllable in either of my <hi>Letters</hi> relating to it. I only endeavoured to evince, That <hi>the King intended to bow or break us, to perswade or force us to Slavery</hi>; and that <hi>the Parliament,</hi> when he was enflamed to take Arms against them, and to put all into a common Combustion, did, in one hand, present their humble Supplications, most earnestly begging to enjoy the English Liberties in Peace; and held in the other hand, <hi>the Sword of just and innocent Defence,</hi> against the Oppression and Violence of the Enemies of the King's true Honour, and of the Kingdom's Peace. And I am yet to learn, that by any Law of God or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, this could be judged to be <hi>Rebellion:</hi> And I cannot see but Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> is of my Opinion; for in his Sermon upon this last 30<hi>th</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:65163:12"/>
of <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1691, pag. 6. he saith,
<q>He shall not dispute the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of resisting the King's Authority; whether it were lawful for the Parliament to take Arms against the King, to defend the Laws and Liberties of their Country. He supposes, that in a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited Monarchy, the Estates of the Realm have Authority to maintain the Laws and Liberties of their Country, against the illegal Encroachments and Usurpations of their King.</q>
Now I go no greater length, and I think this comes up to the great Lord <hi>Russel</hi>'s Position, which you had in my <hi>Letter,</hi> pag. 20.
<q>That a free Nation, like this, may defend their Religion and Liberties, when invaded and taken from them, tho under pretence and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of Law.</q>

            <p>Your next step, <hi>Sir,</hi> is, (<hi>pag.</hi> 6.) <hi>to my Quotation</hi> out of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon of Bishop <hi>Burnet</hi>'s, <hi>Ian.</hi> 30. 1680. which you say you will transcribe, to let the World see what <hi>a Cheat I am.</hi> Well, seeing you did so, I will also transcribe it, that the World may judg whether <hi>you or I be the Knave</hi> in this Matter; the words are these,
<q>I acknowledg it were better if we could have <hi>Iob</hi>'s Wish, that this Day should perish, and the shadow of Death should cover it, that it should not see the dawning of the Day, nor should the Light shine upon it; it were better to strike it out of the Kalendar, and make our <hi>Ianuary</hi> terminate at the 29<hi>th,</hi> and add these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining days to <hi>February.</hi>

               <hi>These words</hi> (say you) <hi>are wrested by</hi> Ludlow, <hi>and they appear at first sight, only a Rhetorical Flight, whereby that Right Reverend Person would express the detestableness and horridness of the Fact, which he bewai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led that day.</hi> Now, because I ever was against judging any thing upon the first sight, I have twice read the Sermon of this Learned, wise and highly meriting Bishop; and must tell you, that I <hi>did not wrest his words,</hi> but that he was of Opinion, that the observation of that Day had been too long continued, and that in regard of the great abuse thereof by some <hi>hot-headed Ecclesiastical Make-bates,</hi> 'twas time to leave it off; and I cannot but think that every Man will conclude as I do, even upon the reading of his Text, <hi>Zech.</hi> 8.19. <hi>Thus saith the Lord of Hosts, The Fast of the fourth Month, and the Fast of the Fifth, and the Fast of the Seventh, and the Fast of the Tenth, shall be to the House of</hi> Judah <hi>Ioy and Gladness, and chearful Feasts; therefore LOVE THE TRVTH AND PEACE.</hi> And I must say, that I am strengthen'd in this Belief, when I remember, that about that Time, and indeed upon the very Day when this Sermon was

<q>It might have been expected, that our 29<hi>th</hi> of <hi>May</hi> should have worn out the remembrance of the 30<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Ianuary</hi>; and now at the end of two and thirty Years, it may be reasonably ask'd, should we still continue to fast and mourn?</q>

            </p>
            <p>I can now scarce with-hold my self from saying, That 'tis most evident <hi>the Doctor</hi> at <hi>Aldgate</hi> doth appear to be the Person who <hi>would wrest Bishop</hi> Burnet<hi>'s well-intended Words, to his own malicious Design.</hi> A Design to keep up Animosity, Wrath and Feuds in the Kingdom; a Person who shews himself estranged from Truth and Peace, in contending to perpetuate the observation of this Day. And see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we have happily lived to behold the wonderful Deliverances which my Lord Bishop of <hi>Salisbury</hi> did not only hope for, but seem to foretel: Seeing we have our glorious 5<hi>th</hi> of <hi>November</hi> rendered famous to all succeeding Ages, by our late repeated happy and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Deliverance from Popery, and its inseparable Companion,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65163:14"/>
Tyranny: Seeing we behold our thrice happy 30th of <hi>April</hi> and 4th of <hi>November, the Birth-Days</hi> of those matchless Princes, our most deservedly admired and beloved Soveraigns, <hi>King William</hi> and <hi>Queen Mary, out-shining and darkening</hi> even the 29th of <hi>May</hi>; I would hope, that I may live to see the time, when his Lordship will make a Motion in Parliament, for the annulling the Law which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joins the Observation of the 30th of <hi>Ianuary</hi>; and that, I am sure, would be highly acceptable to the sincere <hi>Lovers of Truth and Peace.</hi> But,</p>
            <p>I already see an Objection against it; You (Doctor) say, Pag. 2. <hi>An Act of State has appointed this Day to be FOREVER observed, to bewail the Sin of the Murder of the King.</hi> However, I am sure <hi>my Lord Bishop of Salisbury</hi> doth well remember, that in Times by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>past, other Days have been appointed to be observed by <hi>Acts of State,</hi> upon such like Occasions; and one in particular, to declaim against <hi>Gowry</hi>'s <hi>detestable Conspiracy,</hi> which is now forgot: His Lordship also knows, that in <hi>Numb.</hi> 21. when, for the Peoples speaking against <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Moses,</hi> the Lord sent Fiery Serpents, which destroyed many of them. Upon their Confession of their Sin, <hi>Moses</hi> at their Entreaty prayed for them; and (as it is in the 8th and 9th Verses) <hi>The Lord said unto</hi> Moses, <hi>Make thee a fiery Serpent, and set it upon a Pole; and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live: And</hi> Moses <hi>made a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of Brass, and put it upon a Pole; and it came to pass, that if a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent had bitten any Man, when he beheld the Serpent of Brass, he lived.</hi> You see, Sir, <hi>this was God's own Institution</hi>; and that, I hope, was at least as good as your <hi>Act of State.</hi> Let us see now what became of this <hi>brazen Serpent</hi>; 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. <hi>The good King</hi> Hezekiah, (and there were very few good ones in those days) <hi>who did that which was right in the Sight of the Lord, broke in pieces the brazen Serpent that</hi> Moses <hi>had made</hi> [<hi>for unto those days the Children of</hi> Israel <hi>did burn In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense to it</hi>] <hi>and he called it,</hi> Nehushtan.

            <p>(<hi>Page</hi> 7.) You pick a Quarrel with me about my <hi>Epistle Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,</hi> and upbraid me for courting <hi>the Populace,</hi> and Dedicating to <hi>the sincere Lovers of Old</hi>-England, <hi>in</hi> Aldgate-<hi>Parish</hi>; and say, <hi>Sure the King and Queen, or else the Lords of the Council, might have been made the Patrons of a Work that pretends to what</hi> Ludlow<hi>'s doth.</hi> But, whatever you think of your self, or the World of you, methinks 'twas something sawcy, even in you, to prefix <hi>their Majesties Sacred Names</hi> to so silly a Book, as was your <hi>first Defence</hi>; and 'tis as arrogant, to entitle, <hi>the Most Reverend and Right Reverend the Arch-bishops and Bishops, the Nobility, Gentry, &amp;c.</hi> to this <hi>Second</hi>; and to begin as if seated on the Throne, <hi>MY LORDS and GENTLEMEN.</hi> And it seems most impudent, to tell them, that <hi>upon the Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Dishonour of</hi> King Charles <hi>the First, and the Principles which maintain the one, or those that propagate the other,</hi> (as much as if you had said, <hi>upon my Scriblings</hi>) <hi>depend the Being and Well-being of our present Church and State; and consequently the Life and Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our present King and Queen.</hi> But, whatever you may do, 'tis not for the mean Shrubs of the Laity, to soar so high as you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume; and I took mine to be a modest and inoffensive Dedication, and do yet think it ought to be esteemed such, though you snarl, and in your gay or angry Humour, make Distinctions, if not a Schism, and that in your own Parish; and very prodigally throw out to <hi>Ludlow</hi> a good number of your old Benefactors, because they do not believe that they were the only good Men, who took part with the King against the Parliament; who, you say, <hi>only did their Duties in standing by their Prince according to the Laws of the Land, and the Oaths they had taken.</hi> Now, if this be not an inconsiderate and weak Way of arguing, why did not you and your Brethren do your Duty; and (as the <hi>Iacobites</hi> query) stand by King <hi>Iames,</hi> to whom you were sworn? And as to your <hi>Old Englishmen,</hi> whom you cull out and set by for your self, under the Notion of <hi>Lovers of the Government, by King, Lords, and Commons</hi>; I doubt not but there are of your Acquaintance, a great many Pretenders thereto; and yet, if a Man could stand behind the Hangings, at your <hi>Club at the Pye Tavern,</hi> he might hear many of 'em keck at the Healths of <hi>King William and Queen Mary</hi>; and yet be the first who will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose and urge the drinking the King's Health: which every Boy understands, is, in their meaning, <hi>King Iames</hi>'s.</p>

But <hi>this was prophane Wit:</hi> ay, no doubt of it; <hi>there's no Salvation, can there be any Wit out of the Church?</hi> Wit is ever prophan'd, say these Borderers upon it, if any Man touches it but themselves. However, I will adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to borrow again, from my Old <hi>Lay-Friend,</hi> the most ingenious Mr. <hi>Andrew Marvell.</hi>
               <q>Albeit (saith he) Wit be not incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent and incompatible with a Clergy-Man; yet neither is it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separable from them: So that it is of concernment to my Lords the Bishops, henceforward to repress those of 'em who have no Wit, from Writing; and to take care that even those that have it, do husband it better, as not knowing to what Exigency they may be reduced.</q>

            <p>I must confess, <hi>Sir,</hi> this your Expostulation struck me with no small astonishment, and your bold and confident Assertion would, if possible, have made me ready to suspect my self (as you represent me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for one of the <hi>vilest Impostors</hi> that ever appeared in the World; for I never doubted but your <hi>Mother</hi> instructed you in the reading of <hi>English,</hi> and he who hath attain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Upon my second reading you; I observed, that you say, <hi>I have the Letter now before me. AS IT IS IN</hi> RUSHWORTH; this raised a Suspicion in me, that you were conscious that it was elsewhere to be found; why else should you say, <hi>AS IT IS IN</hi> RUSHWORTH? Turning to <hi>Rushworth,</hi> which you were po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring upon when you wrote your Defence, I was confirmed in my Opinion; for in the Margin to that Letter, in <hi>Pag.</hi> 82. I read, and you will see when you put on Impartial Specta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>les, this honest In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation, <hi>There is another Copy of the Prince's Letter to the Pope, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished by several Hands, somewhat different from this.</hi> Well, though you affirm that you find nothing like what I charge; I can see, (as you presently shall) even in <hi>Rushworth,</hi> several Things as like it, as I have found a <hi>Doctor</hi> to be like a <hi>Dunce.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed this Letter to the Pope is not found in Dr. <hi>Gauden's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Book called, Eicon Basilice,</hi> nor in <hi>the Works of King Charles,</hi> neither is it in <hi>Pembrook's Arcadia,</hi> in <hi>Heylin,</hi> or in <hi>Nalson:</hi> But you, good Doctor, may see it in a Book which you have in your Library, for you quote it in your 13th Page; 'tis entituled, <hi>Cabala, Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of State (in Quarto) Pag.</hi> 214. The <hi>Royal Words</hi> there, which you could not, or rather would not find, are these;
<q>I shall never be so extreamly affectionate to any thing in the World, as to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour Alliance with a Prince that hath the same apprehension of the true Religion with my self.</q>
The same thing is expressed by Mr. <hi>Rushworth,</hi> in these Words;
<q>Your Holiness's Conjecture of our Desire to contract an Alliance and Marriage with a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Family and Princess, is agreeable both to your Wisdom and Charity; for we would never desire so vehemently to be joined in a strict and indissoluble Bond with any Mortal whatsoever, whose Religion we hated.</q>
            </p>
            <p>You proceed in the Examination, or rather, as you affirm, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of <hi>Ludlow's Lying,</hi> in the Particulars excerpted from the <hi>King's Letter</hi> to the <hi>Pope.</hi>
            </p>

               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:65163:16"/>2<hi>dly,</hi> Quoth you, <hi>What, Sir, you say, That he calls Popery the Catholick, Apostolick, Roman Religion; all others, Novelty and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction? In what part of the Letter find you this? Sir, I tell you 'tis false, there is not one Syllable of this nature throughout the whole; and I challenge the whole World of Malice to shew me any thing like it in the Letter: And now again, Sir, who ought to leave their L—?</hi> Why, <hi>Sir,</hi> to deal honestly with you, I did say as you charge me; but I must also tell you, that I see 'tis not false; for towards the end of the Letter, I find these Syllables;
<q>I entreat your Holiness to believe, that I have been always very far from encouraging Novelties, or to be a Partisan of any Faction, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Catholick Apostolick Roman Religion.</q>
And in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to your Question, Who ought to leave their L—? I say, they should who are convicted thereof. Now go on to act your part.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> You say, <hi>That he protested, he did not esteem it a matter of greater Honour to be descended from great Princes, than to imitate them in the Zeal of their Piety, who had so often exposed their Estates and Lives in the exaltation of the Holy Cross: And pray where is the Fault in this? I hope any Man that knows what the Holy Cross means in its proper sense, which is nothing else but the Christian Religion, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased upon the Cross by the Blood of Iesus, will say, that this Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station is so far from blackning this great Prince, that it redounds to his Credit and Honour.</hi> These are your Words, are they not, Doctor?</p>
            <p>This Passage is indeed a little diverting: <hi>Ludlow, I observe, is no Lyar here.</hi> You admit this Passage to be in the Letter; and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining you can justify it, do not answer this, with <hi>thou lyest,</hi> for that, <hi>in your Canonical way of Arguing,</hi> appertains only to things unanswerable. But now, upon reading the Letter, it will seem to some as <hi>though I had plaid the Wag in this Point,</hi> and laid <hi>a Trap</hi> for you, as some Body did for me, who gave me to understand that <hi>you were once a Presbyterian,</hi> with which you make your self very merry, as I see <hi>pag.</hi> 50. For if you will please to look into <hi>the King's Letter,</hi> 'tis there <hi>HOLY CHAIR,</hi> though indeed it is <hi>Holy Cross</hi> in mine; and I am sure, <hi>such a Protestation to expose Estate and Life in the exaltation of the Holy Chair, doth not redound to the Honour of a Protestant King</hi>; for we all know that <hi>the Holy Chair,</hi> (mean <hi>the Cross</hi> what it will) in its plain proper sense <hi>means no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but down-right Popery.</hi> But you, <hi>Doctor,</hi> know a ready way
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65163:17"/>
to bring your self off with Honour; and if I had not put a Trick upon you, in writing <hi>Cross</hi> for <hi>Chair,</hi> your Answer would have run thus; <hi>For God's sake, Sir, read over the Letter again, and tell me where there is any Protestation about imitating the Zeal of his Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor's Piety, in exposing his Estate and Life in the Exaltation of the Holy Chair, or any thing like it: I am not so dull, but I understand com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Sense; and this indeed (had it been in the Letter) savours of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, and would have blackned this great Prince; but you Bold-face are past all manner of Shame; and a Man would think you are possessed, for there is not one word like this in the Letter; and I am justly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd to say, Leave your L—.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your next Cavil runs thus, (<hi>pag.</hi> 12.) <hi>You say that he solemnly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to the Pope to spare nothing in the World, even to the hazarding his Life and Estate, to settle a thing so pleasing to God, as Vnity with</hi> Rome. <hi>Surely, Sir, you are past all manner of shame; and a Man would think you were possessed, for there is not one word of this in the Letter; and none but a Person who cares not what Falsities he obtrudes upon the World, in order to deceive the silly and credulous part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind [THE LAITY] would have so boldly printed such a notorious Falshood as this is; and who ought to leave his L—, Sir?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Why now, <hi>Doctor,</hi> you are in the right again, and put down my very Words; and as sure as you do so, so sure 'tis, that I charge nothing but the Truth: And to shew you that <hi>the King's Letter</hi> hath many of the Words, I do here transcribe them;
<q>I will (<hi>saith the King</hi>) imploy my self, for the time to come, to have but one Religion, and one Faith.—Having resolved in my self to spare nothing in the World, and to suffer all manner of Discommodities, even to the hazarding of my Estate and Life, for a Thing so pleasing to God.</q>
And who now ought to leave <hi>his Lying,</hi> let the World judg.</p>
            <p>Having thus, <hi>Sir,</hi> offered what occurs for the right placing the before-charged Lies, allow me to make a Parallel-observation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you. You insert into your Title Page this Expression; <hi>Let the lying Lips be put to silence; which cruelly, disdainfully and despitefully speak against the Righteous,</hi> Psal. 31. Now at the rate of your talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I might well say, <hi>For God's sake turn to your Bible again, and tell me where you find these words.</hi> The Text which I find in my Bible, <hi>Psal.</hi> 31.18. runs thus; <hi>Let the lying Lips be put to silence; which speak grievous things, proudly and contemptuously against the Righteous.</hi> But then you will reply, This is the wonted Custom
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65163:17"/>
of your Party; these <hi>Presbyterians</hi> have their constant recourse to the <hi>Bible,</hi> to oppose the <hi>Liturgy</hi>; but <hi>we Laudean Church-men</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver cite <hi>the Bible,</hi> when we can make <hi>the Common-Prayer</hi> to serve the turn; and <hi>the pestilent Letter-writter</hi> must know, that I took my Quotation out of <hi>the Psalter,</hi> not <hi>Psalms</hi>; and there in the 31<hi>st</hi> and 20<hi>th</hi> Verse, (tho it be the 18<hi>th</hi> in the Bible) are the very words which I put down. 'Tis true, <hi>Sir,</hi> I do find it thus; but how had I been intrapp'd, if I had never seen, or had not had <hi>the Common-Prayer Book</hi> by me, and found that you had an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick Author for what you put down? What a Nest of <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Wasps</hi> should I have brought about my Ears, had I said, <hi>Leave your L—, 'tis false, 'tis not so in my Bible?</hi> And, pray, why may not I, (there being neither Statute nor Canon-Law prohibiting it) take the liberty to quote <hi>the Bible</hi> and <hi>Cabala,</hi> when I quarrel not you for reading <hi>the Common-Prayer Book</hi> and <hi>Rushworth?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To return to what you were upon; the last thing you said, was, <hi>And who ought to leave his Lying?</hi> You then say, (<hi>pag.</hi> 12.) <hi>And as for his</hi> [the King's] <hi>Reply to the Pope's Nuncio, which you mention; after these Falsehoods, pray tell me in what Authentick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor I may find it? for I assure you, you have put so many false things together before, that you have so much lost your Credit with me, that I will believe nothing of your bare Assertion; and I do not doubt but every body that reads both, will be of my mind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your Conclusion here, <hi>Sir,</hi> looks something fair, you seem con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that every body should read both, and speak as he finds. I think they ought to do it; and I address you, in all humility, to be so ingenuous, as to get Allowance that the Press may be open to both Sides for what shall be hereafter published in this Controversy; for 'tis unreasonable that you should rail for what you idely call the <hi>Church of England,</hi> without controul, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the publick Licence and Protection; and 'tis not only incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to print at <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> but in regard there are so many <hi>Tories</hi> and <hi>Iacobites</hi> employed in the <hi>Custom-House,</hi> 'tis no small Risque that every Man runs, who would bring over any thing which is wrote for the Service of <hi>Old-England,</hi> I mean, the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>England,</hi> by King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> with Lords and Commons assembled in Parliament; and that you agree to be <hi>Old-England</hi> indeed. But I have too long digress'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:65163:18"/>You were telling me, that I have so much lost my Credit with you, that you will believe nothing of my bare Assertion. Upon this you must allow me to say, that you are laid so flat by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend and pious Dr. <hi>Walker,</hi> in relation to the idle Story of Sir <hi>Iohn Brattle,</hi> about Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi>'s Book, commonly called <hi>the King</hi>'s, (and which they say Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> doth deny) and you have put down so many things in your Defence of the Martyr, which are incredible, that your Credit is so much impaired with me, that I cannot believe every thing you assert: I therefore desire, that for the future you would give your Authorities (as I shall) for what you write, so that our Readers may know how to make a true Judgment of Things: And I must tell you, that you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deficient in this Point, in your <hi>First Defence of King</hi> Charles, I rather play'd than argued with you in my former Letter. But I will now tell you, that I had the <hi>King's Reply to the Nuncio,</hi> upon his delivering the <hi>Pope's Letter</hi> to him, from <hi>Cabala, Mysteries of State,</hi> pag. 214. where you may read it in these words.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I kiss his Holiness Feet, for the Favour and Honour he doth me, so much the more esteemed, by how much the less deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of me hitherto; and his Holiness shall see what I do here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</q>
[And so did <hi>England, Scotland, Ireland,</hi> and the whole World; his Bishops and Chaplains pressed Popish Innovations, and preached Doctrines of gross Popery.]
<q>And I think my Father will do the like; so that his Holiness shall not repent him of what he hath done.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now, <hi>Sir, Cabala</hi> is a Book of clear Credit, and not to be gain-say'd by you, for you unluckily quote the same Book in the very same Paragraph, wherein you raise your Huy and Cry after my <hi>Authentick Author.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, for the further illustration of the Matters which I have too long dwelt upon, I shall here transcribe, not only that Letter we have been talking of, but that of the <hi>Pope</hi>'s to the <hi>King,</hi> which he answered in so highly obliging terms; and for your bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Satisfaction, you may compare them with <hi>Cabala,</hi> p. 212, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:65163:20"/>This Letter to the <hi>Pope</hi> was presently printed in <hi>Spain,</hi> in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Languages. And I can shew it you in many Authors of Credit; it is found recorded by <hi>Andrew de Chesne,</hi> Chronographer to the French King, in his History of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> Lib. 22. The French <hi>Mercury</hi> (a never controlled Author) hath it also, as I here give it you, in <hi>Tom.</hi> 9. p. 509, 510. printed <hi>Anno</hi> 1623. Mr. <hi>Iames Howel,</hi> an Attendant upon the King in the Spanish Expedition, (and who ever remained firm to him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing imprison'd by the Parliament for a Malignant in the time of the War) doth also point at it in his <hi>Dodonas Grove,</hi> or <hi>Vocal Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,</hi> printed <hi>Anno</hi> 1640. he saith there, <hi>pag.</hi> 128.
<q>That the Pope was a great Friend to the intended Alliance with <hi>Spain,</hi> and wrote to the Prince.</q>
This Letter is also printed in <hi>Pryn</hi>'s <hi>Popish Royal Favorite,</hi> p. 40. in French, and likewise in English, agreeing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly with the Copy in <hi>Cabala:</hi> And Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> saith,
<q>That he hath seen another Copy of this Letter long since in English, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing somewhat different from the French in some Expressions, though not in Substance, and perchance he wrote two of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but it appears that such Letters really passed between the King and the Pope, by divers ancient printed Copies of them in sundry Languages.</q>
Thus speaks Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> himself, and you will credit him, because you tell me he was a Convert, and rectified many of his Errors; yet he never retracted or acknowledged this to be one.</p>
               <p>And now, <hi>Sir,</hi> to expostulate this Matter with you; Is it cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, that a Man of common Honesty, nay a <hi>D. D.</hi> who stiles himself <hi>their Majesties Chaplain,</hi> and dedicates to them, that a pretender to Learning and good Manners, who had notice from <hi>Rushworth,</hi> that there was another Copy of the King's Letter to the Pope, published by several Hands, different from his; that he, who by his own Confession hath <hi>Cabala,</hi> and uses it to serve his Purpose, should treat a Person who writes Truth out of the same Author, with the unbecoming Expression, and that three times over in one Leaf, of <hi>Leave your L</hi>—; that such a Man as you, in such a Case as this, should say, <hi>'Tis false, you are past all manner of shame, and one would think that you are possessed?</hi> But let us see what follows, my <hi>honest Tell-troth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 14. you fall upon Dr. <hi>Leighton</hi>'s Case, and calls the most barbarous and diabolical Sentence, which Bishop <hi>Laud</hi> procured to be pronounced, and most cruelly executed upon him, <hi>his Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65163:21"/>
and say, That <hi>you are something of the mind that he met with hard Fate, and such, as had you been one of his Iudges, [with your present sense of things] you should not have consented to.</hi> So that it seems you cannot be confident but you might have been as wicked as <hi>Laud</hi> himself. And by the discovery which you indiscreetly make of your self a little after, (of which more presently) I have reason to suspect that you would have made the worst Bishop of the two; and then I am sure you had been a very wicked Bishop indeed. You say, <hi>Let me tell you, Sir, Dr.</hi> Leighton <hi>was a great Transgressor, and deserved a severe Punishment.—Must it be Persecution, to call such a foul-mouth'd Person to an Account, and to punish him?</hi> But you, of all Men, Dr. <hi>Brazen-face,</hi> ought to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tender to justifying the severe punishment of a <hi>foul Mouth,</hi> lest a Jury of your Neighbours (should you be called to an account, if for nothing more than your malicious slandering of that Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Divine Dr. <hi>Walker</hi>) should find you to be a <hi>foul-mouth'd Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>; for in such a case [according to your present sense of things] I am something of the mind, you would esteem it hard Fate, <hi>to have your Ears cut, your Nose slit; to be branded in the Face, stand in the Pillory, pay ten thousand Pounds Fine, and be perpetually impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You proceed next (<hi>pag.</hi> 15.) saying, <hi>I have look'd into the Case of</hi> Pryn, Burton, <hi>and</hi> Bastwick.—<hi>[I do, upon a full conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the whole, wish from my Heart their Punishment had been some other way]; I do not think that the way of punishing these Persons was at all Politick or Prudent, [because not for the Interest, as things then stood, either of the King or the Church]. And if Bishop</hi> Laud <hi>had kept in his Study at that time, and not appeared at all, either to hear the Trial, or assist in the Sentence, it had been better for him, and [those Designs of Vniformity he had so much set his Heart upon.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whoever weighs this last Paragraph, must agree in what I but now hinted, that <hi>you, even you Doctor, would have been a worse Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop than</hi> Laud. You well approve the punishing of these three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; but <hi>the way was not Politick or Prudent,</hi> because not for the Interest [<hi>as things then stood</hi>] of King or Church. Let you (sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til <hi>Doctor</hi>) alone for Mischief, though you have a very unhappy Talent at writing in Defence thereof; you would have done it as effectually, but in a more cunning manner; you would have been found <hi>as Arch</hi> and Crafty, but a more close Youth; like the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors in Ancient Times, whose Practices are most ingenuously
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65163:21"/>
express'd by Mr. <hi>Marvel</hi> in these words;
<q>In Persecution, the Clergy as yet, wisely interposed the Magistrate betwixt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and the People, not caring, so their End were attained, how odious they render'd him: And you may observe, that for the most part hitherto, they stood crouching, and shot either over the Emperor's Back, or under his Belly: But in process of Time they became bolder and open-fac'd, and persecuted before the Sun at Mid-day; Bishops grew worse, but Bishopricks every day better and better.</q>
               </p>
               <p>You, <hi>Politick Doctor,</hi> in your great Wisdom, would have taken a more prudent course than Bishop <hi>Laud,</hi> you would, in your Study, have laid such a Scheme as this; <hi>A Iefferies</hi> or <hi>a Wright</hi> should have been made <hi>Lord Chief Iustice</hi>; a <hi>Graham</hi> and a <hi>Burton</hi> should have pack'd <hi>a Iury of</hi> London <hi>Tories,</hi> to give such a Verdict as they should have directed: Hereby these Gentlemen should have been <hi>Whip'd, Pilloried, Stigmatized,</hi> and what else Bishop <hi>Hollingworth</hi> pleas'd, and all by the Hands of <hi>the Laity,</hi> and that <hi>according to Law</hi>; the <hi>Bishop, good Man,</hi> neither assisting <hi>at Trial,</hi> nor <hi>Sentence,</hi> but close at his Book, <hi>as innocent as a wild Boar, and as harmless as a Tyger.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well, <hi>it had been better for</hi> Laud, <hi>and those Designs of Vniformity which he had so much set his Heart upon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And pray, tell me <hi>Sir,</hi> in all Love, what Uniformity was this which thus run in <hi>Laud</hi>'s Head, and which you seem so much to approve? It must certainly be the honest Design of coming to <hi>a due Temper,</hi> to <hi>a uniting of Protestants:</hi> No, no, nothing like it. Mr. <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock</hi> was a good Man; and you say, <hi>pag.</hi> 14. That <hi>you do not in the least question the Truth of what he writes.</hi> Take then his Account of this <hi>Monster,</hi> rather than <hi>Martyr,</hi> and you will see which way his Head turn'd. <hi>Whitl.

<q>In Arch-Bishop <hi>Laud</hi>'s Diary, under his Hand, (produced in Evidence against him at his Trial) are Passages of his being offered to be made a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal; which he said, that he could not suffer till <hi>Rome</hi> were other than it is.</q>
               </p>
               <p>[He wickedly and traiterously design'd, that upon the Pope's yielding, in some few Points, as the <hi>Common Prayers</hi> to be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in English, and such other Tri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<q>The Pope was not Antichrist, but the Head of the Church; and that the Protestant Religion, and Romish Religion were all one; and if the one was false, so was the other.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>He chid Dr. <hi>Hall</hi> (as in <hi>Whitlock,</hi> p. 91.) for giving the Holy Father the Epithets of Antichristian, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He held the Pope to be Metropolitan Bishop of the World.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>He furnished the King's Chappel, (they are Mr. <hi>Whitlock</hi>'s own words, <hi>p.</hi> 85.) 'that Seminary Priests would come thither for their Devotion and Adoration; and some of them were instanc'd, (<hi>this was at his Trial still</hi>) who said, they knew no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their Churches and this Chappel, and some other of our Churches, as they were ordered.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To this I shall subjoin a few Words out of <hi>Rushworth</hi>'s Third <hi>Collection,</hi> Vol. 2. pag. 818.
<q>Arch-Bishop <hi>Laud</hi> endeavoured to advance the Power of the Council-Table, the Canons of the Church, and the King's Prerogative, above the Laws of the Land<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and said, that as long as he sat at the Council-Board, they should know, that an Order of that Board should be of equal Force with an Act of Parliament.</q>
And at another time said,
<q>That he would crush them to pieces that would not yield to the King's Power. He stiled the Parliament <hi>Puritans,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended the <hi>Papists</hi> for harmless and peaceable Subjects.</q>
He said,
<q>That there must be a Blow given to the Church, such as had not been given, before it could be brought to Conformity.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Was not this a rare <hi>Head</hi> of <hi>the Church of</hi> England? Why may not a Man for once, and not practise it, borrow your Words, (dear Doctor) <hi>pag.</hi> 53. and say, <hi>I cannot think</hi> Laud <hi>would have talked thus, unless he had been acted by seven Devils worse thau himself, and then I am sure they must be Devils indeed?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But no more of <hi>Laud</hi> in this place; I return to you, <hi>Mr. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain at Aldgate.</hi> Though you do not commend the doing of the Business of <hi>Pryn, Burton,</hi> and <hi>Bastwick,</hi> in <hi>Laud</hi>'s imprudent way, and that for a weighty Reason, because <hi>you would have done it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> You proceed, <hi>pag.</hi> 16. saying, <hi>The Iustice of the Nation ought not to be afraid of accounting with such bold Men, as they shew'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</hi>— Mr. <hi>Burton</hi> speaking of the Bishops; instead of <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,</hi> calls them <hi>Caterpillers</hi>; instead of <hi>Fathers, Step-fathers.</hi> O horrid! is this true? Why, this was almost as bad as his laying open the <hi>Innovations in Doctrine, Worship, and Ceremonies, which
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:65163:22"/>
had lately crept into the Church, and wishing the People to beware of them:</hi> which I mention to be charg'd upon him; and I question whether <hi>his Eares,</hi> and 5000 <hi>l.</hi> Fine would have paid the Reckoning, if <hi>Hollingworth</hi> had been in <hi>Laud</hi>'s place.</p>
               <p>But, what then would have aton'd for Dr. <hi>Bastwick</hi>'s <hi>Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression?</hi> He (say you) in his Answer to the Information against him, inserted these words; That <hi>the Prelates are Invaders of the King's Prerogative; Contemners and Despisers of the Holy Scripture; Advancers of Popery and Superstition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Idolatry and Profaneness: Also they abuse the King's Authority, to the Oppression of his Loyal Subjects; and therein exercise great Cruelty, Tyranny and Injustice; and in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of those impious Performances, they shew neither Wit, Honesty nor Temperance; nor are they either Servants of God, or of the King, but of the Devil: being Enemies to God, and of every living Thing that is good:</hi> And concluded, that he the said Dr. <hi>Bastwick</hi> is ready to maintain these things thus put down.</p>
               <p>Now, seeing that they cut off his <hi>Ears,</hi> for these Expressions, without bringing the Point to trial; I will put my self in his place, and stake mine against yours, that I will make good every Syllable in this Charge against that <hi>Caterpiller Laud,</hi> and some of his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; when I see you take it to pieces, and say in your Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Flights, <hi>This is false; That's a Lie.</hi> And I will give it under my hand into the Bargain, that I will prove that these Bishops were a Generation of Vipers, which on any terms, would have eaten their way to Preferment, through the Intrails of either Church or State; you may make your best on't Doctor.</p>

<q>The Liturgy had some Alterations from the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish, which made it more invidious, and less satisfactory. — The imposing it, really varied from their former Practices and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions. —. <hi>Pag.</hi> 33. The Lords petitioned, complaining against the Liturgy, and Book of Canons; offering, under the highest Penalties, to prove they contained things both contrary to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and the Laws of the Land. <hi>Pag.</hi> 36. The Earls of <hi>Traquaire</hi> and <hi>Roxburgh,</hi> by Letter to the King, advised him to secure the People of that which they so much apprehended, the fear of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Religion; saying, that they found few or none well sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied. — <hi>Pag.</hi> 33. The Earl of <hi>Trequaire</hi> went to Court, and gave account that all the Troubles were occasioned by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing the Liturgy: with which, scarce a Member of Council (except Bishops) was well satisfied; neither were all these cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for it, for the Arch-bishop of St. <hi>Andrews</hi> from the beginning had withstood these Designs; and the Arch-bishop of <hi>Glasgow</hi> was worse pleased.</q>
               </p>
               <p>See now what <hi>the Scotish Nation</hi> offered against this <hi>Liturgy,</hi> which you, <hi>Doctor,</hi> are sure, <hi>it had been better for them and the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion, if they had received and used it</hi>; Their Commissioners in their Charge against <hi>Laud</hi> (exhibited in our Parliament in 1641) say, (<hi>Pag.</hi> 11, &amp;c.)
<q>This Book inverteth the Order of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in the Book of <hi>England</hi>; of the divers secret Reasons of this change, we mention one only: In joining the Spiritual Praise and Thanksgiving, which is in the Book of <hi>England,</hi> pertinently after the Communion, with the Prayer of Consecration before the Communion; and that under the Name of Memorial or Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, for no other end, but that the Memorial and Sacrifice of Praise, mentioned in it, may be understood according to the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Meaning; <hi>Bellar. de Missâ, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 21. Not of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Sacrifice, but of the Oblation of the Body of the Lord.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The corporal Presence of Christ's Body, is also to be found here; for the words of the Mass-Book, serving to this purpose, which are not to be found in the Book of <hi>England,</hi> are taken in here; Almighty God is incall'd, that of his Almighty Goodness he may vouchsafe so to bless and sanctify with his Word and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, these Gifts of Bread and Wine, that they be unto us the Body and Blood of Christ. — <hi>On the other part,</hi> the Expressions
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:65163:24"/>
of the Book of <hi>England,</hi> at the delivery of the Elements; Of feeding on Christ by Faith, and of eating and drinking in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance that Christ died for thee, are utterly deleted.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now one would think, that if such a <hi>whissling Doctor</hi> as you are, were not past all shame, (as you affirm me to be) it would make you blush, (but we may sooner expect to see you burst) that you, who appeared but now very tender of passing a Judgment upon the Actions of <hi>the accused Star-Chamber,</hi> should be found so pragma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, so arrogant, as to censure King, <hi>Charles</hi> the First, (who damn'd this very Book by Act of Parliament) and the Kingdom and Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> in this Point; and declare, That <hi>you are sure it had been better for them, and the Christian Religion, if they had submitted to the Vsage of this Babylonish Book, and continued it ever since.</hi> But you are so inflexible, that there's little hope of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling you to that Nation, (I had almost said to the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Queen</hi>) unless this <hi>well-approved Liturgy</hi> be sent down once more and entertained there. For then (you say, <hi>pag.</hi> 18.) the Worship of God would be performed with [Order and Decency], and in a way suitable to his Divine Nature and Perfections: And consequently could not have been nauseous to the soberly, wise and seriously devout part of that Kingdom, [as now it is] by reason of those rude and undigested Addresses, those ex-tempore and unpremeditated Expostulations with God; those bold and saucy Applications, that for want of a good Book, or a well-framed Form of Prayer, [of their own before-hand, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to memory] are so commonly made use of in their Pulpits; too many of the accounts of which we have lately, since <hi>the great Turn</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> received from very good Hands, and undeniable Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</p>
               <p>This is, I am sure, a nauseating, if not an ungodly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane way of Talking: You, poor weak Man as you are, run away with a gross Mistake; that because there were Bishops in <hi>Scotland</hi> till <hi>the great Turn,</hi> (as you term the legal Settlement of that Church by their present Majesties) they had also <hi>a Common-Prayer Book:</hi> but believe me, or let it alone, as you please, they had no such thing, it was detested, even by many of their <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Clergy.</hi> I shall not pretend to remark upon your most unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming and malicious Representation of the <hi>praying</hi> of the present Ministers of that Kingdom; but 'tis well known that their <hi>Divines</hi> are of good Ability, and every way well qualified for the discharge of the <hi>Ministerial Function.</hi> And whereas you pretend to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65163:25"/>
a well-framed <hi>Form of Prayer</hi> of their own before-hand, and committed to Memory, for the prevention of rude and undigested Addresses, bold and saucy Applications; I would fain know of you what <hi>Canon</hi> allows a <hi>Minister</hi> of the <hi>Church of England</hi> to frame his own Prayer, and to <hi>mutter</hi> out a good part of it, so as no body can tell what he says: And then to rise constantly in his Voice, when he comes to <hi>the Ox</hi> — and <hi>the Ass</hi>—.</p>
               <p>But to talk seriously of this most serious Matter; pray see what the Devout and Learned <hi>Bishop of Salisbury</hi> says of such <hi>Doctors</hi> as your self, in his Sermon <hi>Ian.</hi> 30. 1680. pag. 9.
<q>Many weak Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, who by the Heat of their Tempers are inclined to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Prejudices, hold, that Addressing to God in Prayer, and the being gaided by the inward Motions of Grace, and God's Holy Spirit, are but illusions of Fancy, if not the Contrivances of designing Men.</q>

               </p>
               <p>Now, <hi>Sir,</hi> upon the whole Matter, I do think it might tend to the Publick Peace, if <hi>my Lord Bishop of London</hi> would please to suspend such a dry and insipid Doctor as you are, from publishing even <hi>ex-tempore and unpremeditated Defences,</hi> and to injoin you <hi>a well-framed Form of Defending,</hi> so that it may be performed with Order and Decency, and not be exposed to Contempt and Scorn, by reason of any rude and undigested <hi>Addresses,</hi> bold and saucy <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications</hi> to their most Sacred Majesties, the Most Reverend and Right Reverend, the Arch-Bishops and Bishops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade my self, that the <hi>Ex-tempore</hi> Rhimes of some Antick <hi>Iack-Pudding,</hi> may deserve Printing better than your empty and non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensical Pamphlets; and that it had been better to have set some Ballad-Singer to have bewailed the King's Misfortunes, than so ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous an Orator as you are found to be, who are so insipid, that there's not the least Spirit in any thing you say.</p>
               <p>Where are you now, <hi>Sir? I, but this Bold face says, This Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy</hi> [<hi>for</hi> Scotland] <hi>was not only composed by Bishop</hi> Laud, <hi>but sent by him to the Pope and Cardinals for their Approbation, and this Story I must not dare to deny.

               <p>You may find the Story of <hi>Laud</hi>'s sending, <hi>the Scots Common-Prayer,</hi> to be approved by the Pope and Cardinals (as I told it) in a Book of good Credit, entituled, <hi>A new Survey of the West-Indies,</hi> wrote by a Reverend Divine of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> Mr. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Gage,</hi> Minister of <hi>Deal</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> 'tis in Page 280, in the <hi>Folio</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression; He there tells you,
<q>That being a Friar, he went to <hi>Rome</hi> with Letters of Recommendation to Cardinal <hi>Barbarini,</hi> the Pope's Nephew, intituled, <hi>The Protector of England:</hi> That coming acquainted with Father <hi>Fitz-Herbert,</hi> Rector of the English Colledg of jesuits, he highly praised Arch-Bishop <hi>Laud,</hi> and said, That he not long since sent a Common-Prayer Book, (which he had composed for the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi>) to be first viewed and approved by the Pope and Cardinals; and that they liked it very well for Protestants to be trained up in a Form of Prayer and Service; yet the Cardinals (first giving him Thanks for his Respect) sent him word, that they thought it was not fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for <hi>Scotland.</hi> That Father <hi>Fitz-Herbert</hi> told him, he was Witness of all this, being sent for by the Cardinal to give them his Opinion about it, and of the Temper of the Scots. And that <hi>Laud</hi> hearing the Censure of the Cardinals concerning his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and Form of Prayer, to ingratiate himself the more in their Favour, corrected some things in it, and made it more harsh and unreasonable for that Nation.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This good Man, Mr. <hi>Gage,</hi> after he had there related the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as above, expresses himself thus;
<q>This most true Relation of Arch-Bishop <hi>Laud,</hi> I have oft spoke of in private Discourse, and publickly in Preaching; and I could not in Conscience omit it here, both to vindicate the just Censure of Death, which the Parliament gave against him, and to reprove the ungrounded Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and Error of some <hi>ignorant Spirits,</hi> who have since his Death highly exalted and cried him up for a Martyr.</q>
               </p>
               <p>You may also find something like this of Mr. <hi>Gage</hi> in Bishop <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi>'s <hi>Memoirs,</hi> pag. 83. he relates,
<q>That in the Year 1638, one <hi>Abernethy,</hi> who from a Jesuit turned a zealous Presbyterian, spread a Story in <hi>Scotland,</hi> which took wonderfully, of the Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of that Kingdom, being sent to <hi>Rome</hi> to some Cardinals to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:65163:26"/>
be revised by them; and that Signior <hi>Con</hi> (the Popes Nuncio to the Court of <hi>England</hi>) had shewed it to <hi>Abernethy</hi> at <hi>Rome.</hi> Indeed the Bishop adds, 'That the Marquess of <hi>Hamilton</hi> wrote to <hi>Con</hi> about it; but he protested seriously, he never so much as had heard of a Liturgy designed for <hi>Scotland,</hi> till he came last to <hi>England</hi>; that he had never seen <hi>Abernethy</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> but once; and finding him light-headed, had never again taken notice of him.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now it takes not much from the Credit of <hi>Abernethy</hi>'s Relation, that <hi>Con</hi> denied it, for it must be noted, that he was a Jesuit; and according to the Tenets of the Romish Church, 'twas lawful, if not his Duty, to lie for Holy Church.</p>
               <p>You come next, with a most convincing Argument, to shew the Falshood of my last Assertion: <hi>What!</hi> (say you, <hi>pag.</hi> 19.) <hi>Bishop</hi> Laud <hi>send to the Pope and Cardinals for their Approbation of a Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy almost the same with ours?</hi> I think this vexatious Ghost will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be laid; I thought we had done with <hi>Laud,</hi> but here he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears again: <hi>What!</hi> Laud <hi>send to the Pope to approve a Liturgy al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most the same with ours?</hi> Ay, <hi>Laud,</hi> the most likely Bishop in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to do it! You say, That <hi>his Heart was set upon Designs of Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity:</hi> And was not this the most probable Course to accomplish them? Mr. <hi>Whitlock</hi> (whom you will credit) shews (as I but now told you) that <hi>Laud</hi> declared, That <hi>the Protestant Religion, and Romish Religion, were all one; and if the one was false, so was the other.</hi> That <hi>he brought the Romish and English Churches</hi> (I think I must say <hi>Steeple-houses</hi> to be rightly understood) <hi>to such a Vnifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, that the Popish Priests knew no difference between theirs and ours.</hi> Why then may we not believe, that in pursuit of that <hi>Plot of Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity</hi> his Heart was so much set upon, he sought the Pope's Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of the Liturgy; whom (as Mr. <hi>Whitlock</hi> himself de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares) he held to be <hi>the Metropolitan Bishop of the World</hi>; so that <hi>Laud</hi> was to him, as that Traitor <hi>Turner,</hi> late Bishop of <hi>Ely,</hi> to <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crost,</hi> but a <hi>younger Brother?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Proceeding to argue the Point, you say; <hi>Sure, Sir, you have forgot the Bull of the Pope, in the</hi> 10<hi>th of Queen</hi> Elizabeth, <hi>which commands all his pretended Catholick Children, not to attend upon the publick Liturgical Devotions of our Church; and you have forgot that [the Papists upon that account, and by virtue of the Authority of that Bull, have declined our Publick Service ever since]; and therefore it is very likely Bishop</hi> Laud <hi>should send a Liturgy to</hi> Rome <hi>for its Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation.</hi>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:65163:26"/>
Most likely, for this very reason, and one who did not well know you to be a Hare-brain'd Blunderbuss, would be ready to conclude with that <hi>ingenious Iacobite</hi> of the <hi>Lacedemonian Society</hi>; who inveighing against my Letter, told a Friend of mine, it must be answered by a <hi>better Pen,</hi> for the <hi>Doctor writes,</hi> said he, <hi>as though he play'd booty.</hi> I appeal to any Man of common Understanding, whether a better Reason can be invented, to persuade the World of the Probability of <hi>Laud</hi>'s sending the <hi>Common-Prayer-Book</hi> to be approved at <hi>Rome,</hi> than you here assigned: The Point is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready settled, that his Head was set upon <hi>Designs of Vniformity; the Pope was his elder Brother; the Papists came to the Common-Prayers of our Church for the first</hi> 10 <hi>years of Q.</hi> Elizabeth; and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, might have so done to this day, had not Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the 5<hi>
                     <hi rend="sup">th</hi>
                  </hi> prohibited them. Let any Man shew me a more probable way to obtain a Repeal of that Bull, which hath made the Papists ever since decline our <hi>Liturgical Church-Devotions,</hi> and to bring them to Church again, or rather to bring us to go to Church with them, than by introducing <hi>a Liturgy</hi> allowed and approved by his <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; a Liturgy in which</hi> (as I said, and you do not deny) <hi>all the material Parts of the Mass-Book seminally were</hi>; and wherein <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation</hi> was rather allowed, than denied. But that empty Head of yours, is carried round, that you do not know what is fit to be said. What have we next?</p>
               <p>Page 20. <hi>Well, Sir, you say, If</hi> [the Common-Prayer-Book] <hi>was sent into</hi> Scotland; <hi>pray let me ask you one Question; In whose Name, and by whose Authority was it sent?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Answer is as obvious as short, and you needed not to have sent to <hi>Switzerland</hi> to have a Resolution in the point; 'twas sent in the name of <hi>one,</hi> who had not Authority to impose it upon the <hi>Scots</hi> according to their Laws.</p>
               <p>You go on, saying, <hi>Why, if they did not like it, did they not first sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missively petition their lawful King, and let him know how disgustful the Liturgy was to many of his Subjects in that Kingdom?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Why, 'tis most evident from all the Historians of that time, that they did in the very beginning, petition in the most submissive man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner against the imposing this <hi>Liturgy</hi>; and that thereupon, after the first reading it in the great Church of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> upon the 23<hi>d</hi> of <hi>Iuly,</hi> 1637, the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> yielded that it should not be further urged by the Bishops, till his Majesty's Pleasure were known. Upon which, the Petitioners returned satisfied to their Habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

But upon the 18<hi>th</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> there being a great conflux of People at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> to hear the <hi>King's</hi> Determinations, a <hi>Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> was published, commanding them upon pain of <hi>Rebellion</hi> to depart the City; and shortly after, the <hi>King</hi> commanded the <hi>Privy Council to receive no more Petitions</hi> against the <hi>Common-Prayer-Book.</hi> Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless you confidently demand, <hi>Why, if they did not like it, did they not first submissively petition?</hi> But the <hi>Scots</hi> shall here answer for themselves; take their own words in their Charge exhibited in Parliament against <hi>Laud</hi>;
<q>Our Supplications (say they) were many against this Book, but <hi>Canterbury</hi> procured them to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd with terrible Proclamations: we were constrained to use the remedy of Protestation; but for our Protestations, <hi>Canterbury</hi> procured us to be declared Rebels and Traitors in all the Parish-Kirks of <hi>England.</hi> When we were seeking to possess our Religion in Peace, against these Devices and Novations, <hi>Canterbury</hi> kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led War against us. — Our <hi>Scotish</hi> Prelates petitioned that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing might be abated of the <hi>English</hi> Ceremonies, as the Cross in Baptism, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but he would not only have these kept, but others super-added; which was nothing else but the adding Fewel to the Fire.</q>

               <p>Read also their Expostulation in their <hi>Remonstrance,</hi> 1639, <hi>Pag.</hi> 4.
<q>Certainly Posterity will hardly believe (as we who have seen it cannot but wonder) how it hath come to pass that we should have so long petitioned our Native Prince to do us Justice, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he is Debtor to his People; and to hear our just Complaints a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Usurpation of a few Men, who were undermining the professed Religion and the Government of the State, and to suffer us to live according to our Laws, and yet could never be heard nor answer'd in the point of our just Desires; far less will they guess what hath been the ground of that merit and trust of one domineering Prelate, in the Affection of the King, that it should be more forcible to diswade, than all the Supplications and Intercessions of so ancient and faithful a Nation, should have po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to move.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Well, what say you next, Mr. Tittle-tattle? <hi>The Scots took a Covenant against Compliance with the Church of</hi> England.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Against Compliance with the Church of</hi> England; Ay, now 'tis out, there's the ground of the Quarrel; <hi>the</hi> Scots <hi>traiterously refused to comply with Bp.</hi> Laud: But they shall speak for themselves; they answer you thus, Doctor.
<q>We are free of the heavy Censures of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:65163:27"/>
Rebellion and Treason, which are so ordinarily thunder'd out, that they are become the less formidable to us. We are supported with this inward Testimony, that we fear God, and still honour the King; although our Adversaries will not be pleased, except we will follow their Rules, which are not unlike those of the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits sound at <hi>Padua,</hi> when they were expelled the Territory of <hi>Venice: One of them was,</hi> [<hi>that</hi> Men should take heed, that they press or inculcate not too much the Grace of God:] <hi>Another was,</hi> [<hi>that</hi> Men must believe the Hierarchical Church, although it tells us, that that is black which our Eye judgeth to be white] Unto which we may add the third, invented by <hi>Ignatius Loyola,</hi> [of <hi>blind Obedience,</hi>] which we have no mind to practise.</q>

               <p>Page 22. <hi>We find</hi> (say you,) <hi>their Seditious, Remonstrances, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations and Pamphlets were dispersed.</hi>—</p>
               <p>Now I cannot find that Mr. <hi>Whitlock,</hi> whom you quote, informs you, that their <hi>Remonstrances,</hi> &amp;c. were <hi>seditious:</hi> this is maliciously foisted in by you, and if you were in <hi>Scotland,</hi> you would, as you deserve, be severely punished (which you would call Persecution) upon the Statute against <hi>Leising-makers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Whitlock,</hi> in <hi>Pag.</hi> 28. which you cite, gives this Relation;
<q>About the year 1560, the Earl of <hi>Murray,</hi> with <hi>Knox, Buchanan,</hi> and others, gave such a shock to <hi>Popery,</hi> as made every thing (and by consequence <hi>Episcopacy</hi>) which stood near it, to reel.</q>
He then shews how <hi>Episcopacy</hi> and <hi>Presbytery</hi> took their turns of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and giving an Account of the <hi>King's</hi> Resolution to inforce the <hi>Common-Prayer-Book</hi>; and by an Army to bring the <hi>Scots</hi> to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, (or as you phrase it, to <hi>compliance with the Church of</hi> England); he saith,
<q>That because this was the Bishop's War, it was held fit that they should contribute largely towards the Preservation of their own Hierarchy; and accordingly, the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy were assembled by the Bishops, in their Diocesses, and invited to a liberal Aid.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I shall now, (Sir,) in a short Digression, shew you from Mr. <hi>Whitlock,</hi> how this was growing up, from being the <hi>Bishop's,</hi> to be a <hi>Popish War</hi>; he relates, <hi>Page</hi> 31.
<q>That the <hi>Queen</hi> employed Sir <hi>Kenelm Digby,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Walter Mountague</hi>
                  </q>
(who at that very time, as we have it in <hi>Gage's Survey of the West-Indies,</hi> p. 209, stood Candidates at <hi>Rome</hi> for a <hi>Cardinal's-Cap</hi>;)
<q>to labour the Papists for a liberal Contribution, which they gained; and Sir <hi>Basil Brooks,</hi>
                     <pb n="32" facs="tcp:65163:28"/>
a Person afterwards very active in the <hi>Irish</hi> Rebellion, was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Treasurer for the Monies, thus raised by the Queen's So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitation for this War against the <hi>Scots:</hi> hereupon some stiled the Forces raised against the <hi>Scots,</hi> in the beginning of the year 1640, THE POPISH ARMY.</q>
But to return to what I intended; I will shew you the Heads of the <hi>Scotch Declaration,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock</hi> puts down upon the <hi>Page</hi> you mention; and that I may not be accused of Partiality, take first the <hi>King's Declaration</hi>;
<q>His <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty</hi> saith, he sets it forth to inform his Subjects of the seditious Practices of some in <hi>Scotland,</hi> seeking the overthrow of Regal Power, under false pretext of Religion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He takes God to witness, he is constrained by their Treasons, to take Arms for the safety of that and this Kingdom. He resolves to maintain Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy there, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> answer;
<q>That though the Secrets of God's Ways cannot be sounded, yet considering his Providence in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal Affairs, the Lord is about some great Work on Earth; for the Cup of Affliction propined to other Reformed Kirks is now presented to them: —That instead of a gracious return to their humble Petitions, from time to time, the return is a late Declaration libell'd against them; though the Gates of Hell shall not prevail against their Cause, and the Kingdom of Jesus Christ now in question. Which Declaration proceeds from the Unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Prelates and their Party. They conclude, setting forth their long suffering of the Prelates Insolency, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and fearing Popery to be introduced. And they say, for doing any harm to <hi>England,</hi> cursed be their Breasts, if they harbour any such Thought, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Your next Accusation, Doctor, against the <hi>Scots,</hi> is, Page 23. <hi>The King consents to a Treaty: Commissioners were appointed on both sides; and they came to a Conclusion, agreeing upon seven Articles; The King justly performed the Articles on his side, notwithstanding the first Article agreed upon, was to disband the Forces of</hi> Scotland <hi>within</hi> 24 <hi>hours, yet these perfidious Persons kept part of their Forces in a body; and all their Officers in pay, and kept up their Fortisications at</hi> Leith. <hi>And now let the Reader judg by this, how deserving these Men are of such Commendations, as this pestilent and bold Letter-Writer gives them.</hi>

<q>We within the space of forty eight hours, the time appointed by his Majesty, dissolved our Army. Concerning the Officers, we were careful, both to observe that Article of <hi>the Pacification</hi> to his Majesty, and also to keep promise to them; which did bind us not to hold them in Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Pay, but to vouchsafe them Entertainment, till they should be restored to their own, or called to other Service; which ought not to be taken for any Breach, Contempt, or Disobedience, but for an observation of the Law of Nature, and common Equity, they being our own Natives, and having forsaken their Places and Means, for Defence of Us and their Native Country; less than this neither could they expect, nor we perform, although the Peace had been most firmly settled.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>All Forts and Castles were speedily restored,</hi> although they be now used for a Terror and Invasion against us. Some part of the <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications</hi> at <hi>Leith</hi> was demolished, for his Majesty's Satisfaction; and the whole remitted by his Majesty to the Town of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> as having right to the same.</q>

               <p>See further what they say in Refutation of this vile Calumny, in their <hi>Remonstrance concerning the present Troubles,</hi> pag. 7.
<q>We delivered all Places into his Majesty's Hands, which were desired, in testimony of our Obedience; and although they might have been in our Hands, Pledges of Assurance for performance of those Articles that were agreed to be granted in the following <hi>Assembly</hi> and <hi>Parliament</hi>; and now, contrary to our Expectation, are tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for Engines of Terror, and Fetters of Slavery, to frustrate us from obtaining the benefit of that <hi>Capitulation.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Now to put you, <hi>Doctor,</hi> to eternal silence, I shall subjoin an unconquerable Evidence against your bold Assertion; <hi>The Pacifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was made upon the</hi> 18<hi>th of</hi> June 1639. <hi>And upon the</hi> 24<hi>th the Marquess of</hi> Hamilton <hi>received possession of the Castle of</hi> Edinburgh <hi>for the King.</hi> This is in Bishop <hi>Burnet</hi>'s <hi>Memoirs</hi> of the two <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miltons,</hi> pag. 144. 'tis a Book you have heard of, though I doubt never seen, (you shall presently see why I say so<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) If this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise be partial, it must incline to the <hi>King</hi> against the <hi>Scots,</hi> because the <hi>Marquess</hi> was deeply engaged in the Royal Cause: This was not only wrote by the <hi>Bishop</hi> when he was <hi>a Chaplain to King</hi> Charles <hi>the Second,</hi> from the <hi>Marquesses own Memoirs,</hi> but is dedicated to
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:65163:29"/>
the King, and was published with his Royal Testimonial, that <hi>he had seen and approved it.</hi> And is there room now for any Man to believe, that if the <hi>Scots</hi> had not acted with the highest Simplicity and Integrity in this Treaty, they would have instantly and volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily quitted the best Strength in that Kingdom to his Majesty? And now let the Reader judg by this, whether one word that such a <hi>paltry Doctor</hi> as you utter, out of your Pulpit, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e to be credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted?</p>
               <p>Well, what comes next? e'ne what lies uppermost, <hi>pag.</hi> 23. <hi>And whereas this scandalizing Person has the confidence to assert, that the King, when he came home, burnt, by the common Hangman, the Paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication he had made: I must tell him, he talks, as he has done all along throughout his Letter, falsly, and [against his own Reading and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg]: and for this I appeal to Bishop</hi> Burnet <hi>in his Memoirs of the two</hi> Hamiltons, <hi>where,</hi> pag. 782. <hi>he acquaints us, That the Scots published a false and scandalous Paper, entituled, Some of his Majesties Treaties with his Subjects of</hi> Scotland; <hi>so Vntrue and Seditious, that it was burnt by the Hands of the Common Hangman. And are not you a base Person then, to oberude such a Lie upon the World as you have done? But it is no wonder, the Father, whose Cause you have served in this rude and seditions Libel, is the Father of Lies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Why, now most <hi>unhappy Doctor,</hi> you are catch'd again; and whereas you say that <hi>I talk falsly against my reading,</hi> it will be found that <hi>you talk at random for want of reading.</hi> I told you that I su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected you had never seen Bishop <hi>Burnet</hi>'s <hi>Alemoirs,</hi> you shall now see my reason for it; You quote <hi>pag.</hi> 782. and there are but 436 Pages in that Book, and 47 in the <hi>Appendix.</hi> And for my part, I have read it some Years since, and now turn'd it over, but cannot find therein the Story for which you vouch him: I am apt to think, (as you told me <hi>pag.</hi> 50.) That <hi>some crafty Knave, finding you rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to pick up any Story, whereby you might serve your Cause, had a mind to put a Trick upon you, and to expose the Truth of the rest of your Book, by telling you, that Bishop</hi> Burnet<hi>'s Evidence against the</hi> Scots, <hi>would outweigh a thousand Witnesses; and that he had declared what false Loons they were, in a certain Book called his</hi> Memoirs. But is not he a <hi>Blockhead</hi> then that will be so imposed upon?</p>
               <p>Nevertheless, to deal openly, and without reserve in this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; I find these <hi>Memoirs</hi> speaking thus, (<hi>pag.</hi> 143.)
<q>When the <hi>Scotch Commissioners</hi> came back to the Camp, they gave an account of their Negotiation; and besides <hi>Articles of Treaty,</hi> they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:65163:29"/>
another Paper, [<hi>which passed among all for the Conditions of Agreement</hi>]; it was a Note containing some Points which were alledged to have been agreed to at <hi>Berwick, verbally,</hi> though not set down in the <hi>written Treaty</hi>; which was made up of some <hi>down-right Mistakes,</hi> [this Term comes something short of <hi>False, Scandalous, Vntrue and Seditious,</hi> which are your <hi>Ep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>thets</hi>]; and of <hi>other things which the King in discourse had indeed said, but not positively, nor as a Determination on which he had concluded.</hi>—</q>
               </p>
               <p>It were now worth the knowing, what, in particular, these <hi>down-right Mistakes, and these other things,</hi> were; but this History leaving us in the dark therein, I shall shew you what was the main thing which gave distaste, in that Paper which Bishop <hi>Burnet</hi> saith, <hi>passed among all for the Conditions of the Agreement</hi>; and how the Estates of <hi>Scotland</hi> justified that Paper from the Imputation of <hi>Mistakes.</hi> The Paper is intituled, <hi>Some Conditions of his Majesty's Treaty with his Subjects of</hi> Scotland, <hi>before the English Nobility.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>It is there remembred, that it being with all Instancy and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility prest, <hi>Saturday,</hi> June 15. that his Majesty would satisfy that main Desire of his Subjects, by declaring, that he would <hi>quit Episcopacy</hi>; did answer, That it was not sought in our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires. And when it was replied, That our first Desire to have the <hi>Acts</hi> of the <hi>General Assembly</hi> ratified, imported the same: His Majesty acknowledged it to be so, and averred, that he did not refuse it, but would advise till <hi>Monday</hi> the 17<hi>th.</hi> At which time his Majesty being prest to give some Signification of his <hi>quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Episcopacy</hi>: And it being plainly shown to his Majesty, That <hi>if he would labour to maintain Episcopacy, it would breed a miserable Schism in this Kirk, and make such a Rapture and Division in this Kingdom,</hi> as would prove uncurable: And if his <hi>Majesty</hi> would let the <hi>Kirk</hi> and <hi>Country</hi> be freed of them, his <hi>Majesty</hi> would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive as hearty and dutiful Obedience as ever Prince received of a People: His <hi>Majesty</hi> answer'd, that he could not prelimit and forestal his Voice, but had appointed <hi>a Free Assembly, which might judg of all Ecclesiastical Matters</hi>; the <hi>Constitutions whereof he promised to ratify in the ensuing Parliament.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>See now what the <hi>Estates of Scotland</hi> said, in vindication of themselves in this Matter; you will find them thus expressing it, in their <hi>Representation of the Proceedings of the Kingdom,</hi> pag. 15.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>After much Agitation, and many Consultations, his Majesties Declaration, touching the intended <hi>Pacification</hi> was read to our
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:65163:30"/>
                     <hi>Commissioners</hi>; who, upon their Dislike and Exceptions taken both at Matter and Expressions, as contrary to our Minds, and prejudicial to our Cause, did humbly remonstrate, that <hi>the Declaration,</hi> as it was conceived, could not give Satisfaction to us from whom they were sent. His Majesty was graciously pleased to command some words to be deleted, other words to be changed; and many parts thereof were, by <hi>verbal Promises</hi> and Interpretation, from his Majesty's own Mouth, mitigated: Which in our Estimation, were equal to that which was written, some of <hi>the Counsellors of England,</hi> assuring our <hi>Commissioners,</hi> that <hi>what was spoken and promised be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Men of Honour, and in the Face of two Armies, was no less cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and would (no doubt) be as really performed, as if it had been written in Capital Letters</hi>; which therefore were diligently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, carefully remembred, and punctually related by our <hi>Commissioners,</hi> at their delivering of his <hi>Majesty's Declaration</hi> to us: And without which, <hi>we nor could nor would have condescended and consented to the Articles of the Declaration, more than we could or would, against the Light of our Minds and Consciences, have sinned against God, and condemned our own Deed.</hi> Thus way was made to the <hi>Pacification,</hi> and for preoccupying all Mistakes, whether wilful possibly by some, or through weakness of Memory by others. <hi>These vocal Interpretations and Expressions, were collected, keeped by our selves, and in Papers delivered to some of the Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners of</hi> England.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It may now be observed, upon the whole Matter, that this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per contained nothing contrary to the Articles, or the Pacification, but was a mollifying of his Majesty's Declaration, that it might be the more readily received by the People. And it had been more than imaginable Impudence, to put into the Hands of the <hi>Nobility of England,</hi> a Paper professing what was openly spoken but just be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in their own hearing; and yet containing Untruths and sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Positions, contrary to all that was done for Peace.</p>
               <p>The Truth of the Case is this; The King had promised them a <hi>General Assembly,</hi> to be holden the 6<hi>th</hi> of <hi>August,</hi> and a <hi>Parliament</hi> upon the 20<hi>th,</hi> to ratify what should be decreed in the <hi>Assembly:</hi> But he was reprimanded by the Queen and the Bishops, who vili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied <hi>the Pacification,</hi> and upbraided him, that he had brought home a dishonourable Peace. Whereupon he altered his Mind, declaring, that what had been agreed, would be <hi>unprofitable for the Kirk,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he well knew that nothing short of the extirpation of <hi>Prolacy</hi>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:65163:30"/>
could satisfy that People. He therefore, about a Month after the <hi>Pacification,</hi> set himself to pick a Quarrel with them; and upon the 18<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Iuly,</hi> 1639, he charged them with no less than Eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen <hi>Criminal Articles</hi>; whereof they denied some, and made full Answers to the rest. I shall touch upon two of them, because they refer to your <hi>Discourse</hi> which we are now examining.</p>
               <p>The third <hi>Article</hi> was,
<q>Forces not dismissed; and in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, <hi>Monro's</hi> Regiment yet kept on foot.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Answer was this;</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Since his Majesty will have that Regiment disbanded, the same shall be done presently: But we humbly beg, that his Majesty would be pleased to dismiss the Garisons in <hi>Berwick, Carlisle,</hi> and the rest of the Borders.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The 18<hi>th Article</hi> was;
<q>The Paper divulged; and if they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vow the same?</q>
               </p>
               <p>Which had this modest Answer:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>As we are most unwilling to fall upon any Question which may seem to import the least Contradiction with his Majesty; so if it had not been the Trust which we gave to the Relation of our Commissioners, the written Declaration would not have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable, nor the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> Rendered, except for the Trust we reposed in their Relation, and Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>idence in his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty's Royal Word, which we believe they did not forget: which Paper was only written for that cause, left his Majesty, or his Subjects should aver, that they spake any thing without War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.</q>
               </p>

               </p>
               <p>No more of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Let's see what's next. You declare your Resolution, to apply your self <hi>to the Defence of what you had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly said in behalf of King</hi> Charles; and proceed thus (<hi>Page</hi> 26.) You say, <hi>That those Gracious Acts which I mention, were bought of him, and what then? What hath been more usual ever since Parliaments had a being in</hi> England? <hi>Pray look into the Statute-Book, and tell me what Gracious Favours can you find bestowed by the several Kings of this Realm, upon their People, that those People have not made their acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments for them, by presenting their Soveraigns with great Sums of Money?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What ridiculous Stuff is this? <hi>Gracious Acts, Gracious Favours, &amp;c.</hi> It hath been heretofore well observed, that some who call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Church-men, have left their Station to become ignorant and unhappy States-men, who have made the Church, and the Tenets thereof, an Instrument of Bondage to the Subject. These Men tell us that Parliaments are not assembled to ease the Grievances of the Subject, but to fill the Coffers of the Prince: These Men teach Princes that all the Rights and Liberties of the Subject, and the maintenance of them, are <hi>Doals of Grace,</hi> and Gifts of meer Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, proceeding from the Prince, (and not the true Birth-right of the Subject, which they may truly challenge) which are to be continued or changed as Princes shall think fit. But pray let us see what these <hi>Gracious Acts,</hi> these <hi>Gracious Favours,</hi> were, which we
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:65163:33"/>
bought, as in your Opinion we ought: They were Acts to declare the levying Money by way of forced Loan, Ship-Money, Coat and Conduct-Money, to be illegal, and against the undoubted Liberty of the Subject; to suppress the most accursed and tyrannical Courts called the Star-Chamber and High-Commission; to bring a Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to Justice; to secure us of the sitting of a Parliament once in three Years, when the antient Laws gave us a right to Annual Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, and when he had, to the high violation of those Laws, kept us without a Parliament for about eleven Years. These Acts, say you (their Majesties Malapert Chaplain at <hi>Aldgate</hi>) are such <hi>Gracious Favours,</hi> that if we will have them, we ought in all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science to buy them. But our English Parliaments have always been of another Mind; and Sir <hi>Robert Cotton</hi> tells us in the Life of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, That that King was told in full Parliament, that they would not pay his Debts, nor give him a Groat, <hi>postquam coepit esse dilapidator Regni,</hi> so long as he continued to destroy the Kingdom. And pray now turn to your Bible, and tell me what Text there, doth warrant this your wild Opinion. Where are we now?</p>
               <p>But <hi>buy these Acts did they? Pray who had the disposal of the Money? how was it laid out? was it given to the King to do what he listed withal? No, you know a great part of it was bestowed on the</hi> Scots, <hi>for the good Service they did in rebelling against their King, and putting two King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms into a Flame.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I did observe (in my Letter to you) that the King had out of the Subjects Purse in the first Year of the Parliament, <hi>Nov.</hi> 1640. one Million and an half of Money. I also remember that the King upon the Conclusion of the Treaty at <hi>Rippon,</hi> agreed to allow the <hi>Scots</hi> 850 <hi>l. per diem</hi>; and in answer to your question, I say, the King had the disposal of the Money; and as to what part of it the <hi>Scots</hi> received, the King paid it to them, for his having done against all Law and Reason what he listed. And I will shew you from the Demand of that Nation, who ought to have paid the Reckoning. They say,

Forces, but their Church-Canons and Prayers, for our utter Ruine, which make them obnoxious to our just Accusations, and guilty of all the Losses and Wrongs which we have sustained. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may now with the greater Reason and Confidence press our Demand, that the Parliament, the Kingdom, and the King himself may see us repaired in our Losses, at the Cost of that Faction, by whose Means we have sustained so much damage. We will never doubt but the Parliament in their Wisdom and Justice, will provide that a proportionable part of the Cost and Charges be born by the Delinquents. We wish the Justice of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may be declared in making the Burden more sensible to the Prelates and Papists, than to others who never have wronged us, which will conduce much to the Honour of the King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</q>

               <p>No, by no means, you talk now like <hi>a Rational Creature:</hi> We are then to look for the <hi>Why's and Wherefore's.</hi> You acknowledg in your first Defence, that these Courts were <hi>Grievances</hi> to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and I said, and by many sad Instances proved, that they were <hi>Arbitrary and Tyrannical Courts, Forges of Misery, Oppression and Violence:</hi> There's then <hi>a Why,</hi> for you Doctor. The Parliament agreed with the King, to give him the <hi>Poll-Bill</hi> to remove these ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed Courts of Oppression and Tyranny; There's also <hi>a Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</hi> Nevertheless, though the Parliament voted that he should pass all the three Bills, or none at all; he snatching up their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, runs away, and delays to pass the Bills for abrogating the <hi>Star-Chamber</hi> and <hi>High-Commission Courts</hi>; and yet you affirmed, <hi>That HE READILY passed whats<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The next thing in course, is, (<hi>Page</hi> 28.) the unhappy Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi>'s Case, in relation whereunto you, most learned Doctor, whose Head is swell'd like any Bladder with Wind and Vapour, do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

made use of, as a Precedent for the time to come.</hi> This is well enough urged for a D. D. and is passable, the Man who utters it being considered: But I must tell you, Sir, what I have heard as wife a Man as you say about this Clause, of <hi>not bringing it into Precedent</hi>; that in such Cases it could not be otherwise, without leaving the same Power to the Judges in <hi>Westminster-Hall,</hi> which by the Statute of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, is intrusted only with the Parliament; for that Statute, ennumerating all Treason cognizable by the Judges, reserves to the Parliament <hi>declarative Treason</hi>; as that which they might be safely intrusted with: though it could not be so in the Hands of any other Jurisdiction. And that this is the reason of that Clause, I am told no Lawyer, though never so much a Tory, will deny.</p>
               <p>Allow me now, Sir, seeing we are talking of <hi>Strafford,</hi> to lay before you a pleasant Dialogue, which I find in <hi>Whitlock's Memoirs, pag.</hi> 41. between your three Martyrs, the <hi>King,</hi> the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> together with the Lord <hi>Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tington,</hi> a Papist; and that upon the 5th of <hi>May</hi> 1640. the very Day upon which the Parliament was dissolved for their refusing to furnish Money to carry on the wicked War then resolved upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Scotland</hi>; the Paper is entituled,</p>

                  <hi>Husband</hi>'s exact Collections (a Book in esteem with you) beginning at <hi>Pag.</hi> 220. I there find that <hi>the two Parties</hi> who confessed that the French about the Town were to be mounted, and that <hi>the Clergy</hi> were to find 1000 Horse, were Lieutenant Colonel <hi>Ballard</hi> and Captain <hi>Chudleigh.</hi> But in regard you have taken the Pains to relate what his Majesty's Declaration said to this Point; I shall, for the setting the matter in its true Light, transcribe a brief Account thereof from the Declaration of the Parliament, (which you most rudely call the Faction) as you will find it in <hi>Husband</hi>'s Collections, <hi>Pag.</hi> 200. There, speaking of the intended Force upon the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, they declare themselves thus.
<q>Certainly we have been more tender of his Majesty's Honour in this point, than he, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever he was, that did write his Majesty's Declaration; where he calls God to witness he never had any such Thought, or knew of any such Resolution of bringing up the Army; which truly will seem strange to those who shall read the Depositions of Mr. <hi>Goring,</hi> Information of Mr. <hi>Piercy,</hi> the Examination of Mr. <hi>Wilmot,</hi> Mr. <hi>Pollard</hi> and others; with the other Examination of Capt. <hi>Legg,</hi> Sir <hi>Iacob Ashley,</hi> and Sir <hi>Iohn Conyers:</hi> and consider the Condition and Nature of the Petition, which was sent unto Sir <hi>Iacob Ashley,</hi> under the Approbation of <hi>C.

               </p>
               <p>You tell me, <hi>pag.</hi> 43. That <hi>I have been so bold in my Assertion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Tumults, that I give the Lie to almost all the Historians that have writ the Transactions of those Times; and you refer me to the Votes of the Common Council,</hi> Dec. 31. 1641. Now, because you are short in the Relation of that Matter, I shall give you it as it is in <hi>Husband</hi>'s <hi>Collection,</hi> pag. 30. The Lord <hi>Newburgh,</hi> upon <hi>Dec.</hi> 31. 1641, delivered a Message from his Majesty to the Common Council, to this effect;
<q>There having been of late many tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary Assemblies about <hi>Whitehal</hi> and <hi>Westminster,</hi> the King recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to their Care the preventing the like Tumults; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, That he was so well assured of the good Affections of the City, that he could in no wise understand it to have any share in the Fault of these Tumults, but that they proceed meerly from the mean and unruly People of the Suburbs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:65163:36"/>Hereupon the Common Council returned Answer,
<q>That they had no hand in these tumultuous Proceedings, and disavowed the same; and promised their best Endeavours to prevent and suppress, in time to come, all such tumultuous Assemblies, and all mutinous rebellious Persons: And they humbly desired, that all the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents, and Causers of Tumults, being apprehended, may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive condign Punishment.</q>
And,</p>
               <p>
                  <q>They ordered every Member of the Common Council to make it known, That if any Person should neglect his Duty of Watch and Ward, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and not do his best Endeavour to suppress or prevent Tumults, he shall receive condign Punishment.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now, <hi>Sir,</hi> I appeal to all Mankind, whether this doth any way serve your Purpose? You refer to the Votes of the Common Council, and would thence argue, that the King was necessitated, by reason of the Tumults, to leave <hi>Whitehal.</hi> But the contrary is most evident, from the King's Message, and the Answer and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions of the City. The King declares, That he was well assured of the good Affections of the City, and that they had not any share in the Fault of the Tumults, but that they proceeded meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the mean and unruly People of the Suburbs. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Council promises to prevent and suppress all Tumults, and command strict Watch and Ward to be kept to that purpose. And might not the King have been hereby perswaded, that he was in no danger from Tumults? Were not these Votes a full Security a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Fear, from such Disorders for the future? No doubt but they were; but the King had other Designs than those of Peace in his Head. I told you of his Majesty's fortifying <hi>Whitehal,</hi> and that armed Men sallied out thence, reviling, menacing, and wounding many Citizens passing by with Petitions to the Parliament; and that when the Parliament and People complained of those Assaults, the King justified the Authors thereof; so that I must needs conclude (as I did before) that the Tumults were made at <hi>Whitehal</hi> by the King's own People; that <hi>all his fear of Tumults, was but a meer Pretence and Occasion taken, of his resolved Absence from the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that he might turn his flashing at the Court-Gate, to slaughtering in the Field.</hi>

                  </gap>would be an inexcusable Fault in the King; but to Rufute me, you transcribe his Majesties own Vindication of himself, which saith, that <hi>he was in</hi> Scotland <hi>when the Rebellion broke forth, that he immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended the care of that business to the Parliament here; —. That if no Proclamation issued sooner (of which for the present he was not certain, but thinks that others were issued out before) it was because the Lords Iustices of</hi> Ireland, <hi>desired them no sooner, and when they did, the number they desired was but twenty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now in Truth Sir, this doth little mend the matter; 'tis most strange that the King should publish to all the World in Print, that <hi>he thinks other Proclamations were issued before</hi>; he might without doubt have easily been at a certainty in this point, for had there been any such thing, his Council Books, his Secretary of State, his Clerks of the Council, would have remembred him thereof; but to this day, no such thing hath appeared nor ever will: And 'tis a poor excuse to say, that <hi>the Proclamation was no sooner issued, because not sooner desired.</hi> We of this Age, do remember in what manner our Late Princes (Fathers 'nown Sons) have pursued the least suspition of Rebellion: You know that King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, upon <hi>the pretence of a Plot,</hi> in the year 1683 was so far from deferring by the space of three Months, to issue a <hi>Proclamation</hi> against his own Son, the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Monmouth</hi>; that we had it in three days, and I do think there were rather forty Thousand than forty Printed; for after we had it by it self, for the better spreading thereof, it was published in the Gazette; the like course you well know, was taken by the Late King <hi>Iames</hi>; First in the case of the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and then in that of the Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi> But I will shew you what the Parliament said in this case of the <hi>Irish</hi> Rebels in a Declaration in 1642.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>That when the Lords and Commons, had upon the first breaking out of the <hi>Irish</hi> Rebellion, immediately sent over 20000 <hi>l.</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged themselves for the reduceing of the Rebels, yet the King af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Return from <hi>Scotland,</hi> was not pleased to take notice of it, until after some in the House of Commons, had truly observed how forward his mischievous Counsellors were, to incite him against his <hi>Protestant Subjects of</hi> Scotland, and how slow to resent the proceedings of his <hi>Papist Traytors in Ireland.</hi>

                  <q>That altho the Rebels had most impudently stiled themselves, <hi>The Queen's Army,</hi> and profest that <hi>the Cause of their Rising was, to maintain the King's prerogative, and the Queen's Religion, against the Puritan Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of</hi> England; and that thereupon the Parliament advised his Majesty to wipe away this dangerous scandal by proclaiming them Rebels; which then would have weakned the Conspirators in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and have encouraged both the Parliament here, and good people there, the more vigorously to have opposed their proceedings; yet <hi>no Proclamation was set forth to that purpose, till almost three Months after the breaking out of this Rebellion,</hi> and then Command given, that but forty should be Printed, nor they published, till further directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons should be given by his Majesty.</q>

               <p>
                  <q>That when divers well affected persons had prepared twelve Ships and Six Pinnaces, with more than 1000 Land Forces, at their own charge, for the service of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and desired nothing but a Commission from his Majesty to enable them thereunto; That Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, after twice sending to <hi>York</hi> for the same, was likewise de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied.</q>

               <p>There are indeed in <hi>England</hi> a great many kinds of Birds and of Beasts also, and a great many of every kind, and before we part we will a little recreate our selves with some of them: <hi>you must not think to catch such Birds with Chaffe</hi>: A witty Conceit upon my word; and had your dull fancy chopt upon this other flight, <hi>neither must Chicken think to feed Capons,</hi> it would have made you as proud as a Peacock,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:65163:38"/>
and you would have clapt your Wings &amp; crow'd like any fighting Cock, at the wit of the Expression;
<q>But (begging pardon of your Gravity) I will tell you that it hath been observed, that of all Creatures in the Creation, the <hi>Owle</hi> of Birds, and the <hi>Ass</hi> of Beasts are the most grave, and Sr. <hi>William Temple</hi> in his <hi>Memoires</hi> of what past in <hi>Christendom</hi> from 1672, to 1679, page 57, saith, that <hi>Old Prince Maurice of Nassau</hi> when he was about 76 years of Age (having ever passed for an honest and pious man) informed him, that when he was Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of <hi>Brafil,</hi> he heard of a <hi>Parrot,</hi> that spoke, and asked, and answered common questions like a reasonable Creature, and tho he believed nothing of it, his curiosity lead him to send for it; That when it came first into the Roome where the Prince was, with a great many <hi>Dutch men</hi> about him, it said presently, <hi>What a Company of White Men are here</hi>? they asked it, <hi>what he thought that Man was?</hi> pointing to the Prince, it answered, <hi>Some General or other</hi>; the Prince asked it, <hi>whence came you</hi>? it answered, <hi>from Marinnan</hi>; the Prince, <hi>to whom do you belong</hi>? the Parrot, <hi>to a Portugez</hi>; Prince, <hi>what do you do heere?</hi> Parrot, <hi>I look after the Chickens</hi>; the Prince laughed and said, <hi>you, look after the Chickens</hi>? the Parrot answered, <hi>yes I, and I know well enough how to do it,</hi> and made the <hi>Chuck</hi> four or five times, that People use to make to Chickens when they call them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now one would hope that this pritty Bird which discoursed so ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, might put <hi>a braying Beast</hi> to silence, if any thing but pulling out the <hi>Asses.</hi> Tongue could do it: you see <hi>Doctor,</hi> that this Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing <hi>Parrot</hi> could distinguish <hi>White from Black,</hi> knew its own Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, and undertook no other Task than it could well perform, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Chuck, Chuck, Chuck,</hi> to the Chickens very pertinently, which is more than you do to your Birds; that this ingenious fair dealing <hi>Parrot,</hi> when it talked with the <hi>Prince</hi> (not thinking it would pass for an answer to have told him, <hi>you must not think to catch such Birds as me with Chaffe</hi>) came close to the point, and gave direct and sensible Answers to plain and honest Questions, whereas you prevaricate in a most shameful manner, and prate, as tho you were only fit for the Conversation of a Flock of <hi>Magpies, Iackdaws, Wood-cocks, Owles,</hi> and <hi>Buz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<q>I have seen (saith he) with some pleasure, the Hawking at the <hi>Magpye</hi>; the poor Bird un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands very well the terrible pounces of that Vulture, but there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore she chatters amain most rufully, and spreads and cocks her tail, so that one that first saw and heard the sport, would think that she insulted over the Hawk in that Chatter, and huffed her Train in token of Courage and Victory; when, alas! tis all from her fear, and another way of crying the Hawke mercy; and to the end that the Hawke finding nothing but Tail and Feather to strike at, she may so perhaps shelter her Body.</q>

I have been told that you ought to have said that what you did in that day, was <hi>to the great enriching of your self,</hi> and that you had your <hi>Why's</hi> and your <hi>Wherefore's</hi> for your kindness to the Dissenters; that you received a constant Contribution from such of them as you preserved from <hi>Doctors Commons</hi>; and I know it may be made out, that at your own entreaty, a Collection was made amongst them, by Mr. <hi>Ogden</hi> and Mr. <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and is it not an Act of foolish Prodigality in you, to throw off such generous Benefactors as these?</p>
               <p>Having thus Examined your <hi>Second Defence,</hi> I shall now Sir recount the Heads of some things which you asserted in your First, and which being answered by me, you pass over in silence.</p>
               <p>You affirmed page 7th. of your first Defence, that <hi>the Parliament in their Remonstrance</hi> Dec. 1641. <hi>made Reflections upon the King's for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Government, unmanner's and false; and that the King answered it and vindicated himself from those horrid aspersions, wherewith they Loaded him:</hi> Now, pa. 35. I denied the falsehood thereof, and said, that the King only answer'd it, in saying, <hi>We shall in few words pass over that part of the Narrative wherein the misfortunes of this Kingdom, from our first entring to the Crown, to the beginning of this Parliament, are remembred in so sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible expressions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You asserted pa 12. that <hi>the King could by good Evidence prove,</hi> the Lord <hi>Mandevile,</hi> Mr. <hi>Holles,</hi> Sir <hi>Arthur Hasterig,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hambden,</hi> Mr. <hi>Pym</hi> and Mr. <hi>Strode,</hi> Members of the House of Commons <hi>Guilty of Treason</hi>; Page 37, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I gave you the full History of that matter, and shew'd that <hi>the King retracted that rash accusation,</hi> which I see is more than you will do, tho good manners one would think should oblige you thereto, and to beg pardon especially of the right Honourable, the present Earl of <hi>Manchester,</hi> as he is a Peer of the Realm; and of the right Honourable and most eminently deserving Patriot Mr. <hi>Hambden,</hi> as he is Chancellour of the their Majesties <hi>Exchequer</hi> and one of their most Honourable Privy-Council, for such a horrid slander brought upon their highly deserving Families; but you find it a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous thing to forgo a falsehood that is serviceable to your great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking.</p>
               <p>You affirm pa. 26. first defence, that <hi>the Scots sold the King to the English Parliament.</hi> I denied it pa. 67. and shew'd that <hi>the Scots might, with the consent of the Parliament, have taken him home to his Native Country; but that they refused it, fearing he might raise new Commotions there,</hi> and you have not thought fit to contradict me in this nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:65163:41"/>You, amongst other gracious concessions of the King's, wherein you glory, speak, pa. 11. 1st. Defence; of his consenting to <hi>a Treaty at Vx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge.</hi> I (page 61) mentioned many things relating to that Treaty; and to shew the King's insincerity in his pretensions of Peace, gave a Relation how that at the very instant of that Treaty, he used all imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable means to bring not only 10000 <hi>Lorrainers,</hi> but <hi>the Irish Cut-Throats</hi> against the Parliament; That he declared himself resolved to adhere not only to the <hi>Bishops,</hi> but also to the <hi>Papists,</hi> &amp;c. These are Reproaches which you ought to wipe off, if you would defend this King to any purpose, but you touch them not.</p>
               <p>View now I beseech you, the Heads of many of the Articles of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>government which I recounted, and which you have overlookt, only saying in relation to them, that <hi>some Birds are not to be catcht with such Chasse,</hi> and I have done.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <q>I. King <hi>Charles</hi> I. <hi>favoured Popery</hi>; by his Marriage Articles he agreed that Papists should not be molested; he put above a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Popish Lords and Gentlemen into great Trusts.</q>

               <p n="2">
                  <q>II. <hi>His Bishops were unsound in their principles</hi>; in particular <hi>Land</hi> allowed Books which favoured Popery, but refused to License Books written against it. <hi>His Chaplains</hi> endeavoured to reconcile <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> and got preferment by it.</q>

                  <q>III. <hi>He Lent Ships to the French King to destroy the Protestants of</hi> Rochel, which as the French boasted mowed the Hereticks down like Grass.</q>

               <p n="4">
                  <q>IV. <hi>He Raised an Army,</hi> and required the Country to furnish <hi>Coat and Conduct Mony</hi>; and Levied Mony by way of <hi>Loane,</hi> and <hi>the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusers</hi> of the meaner Rank (Men of Quality being imprisoned) <hi>were compelled to go for Souldiers, or to serve at Sea.</hi>
                  </q>

               <p n="5">
                  <q>V. <hi>He Suspended and Confined the Arch-Bishop of</hi> Canterbury (not <hi>Land,</hi> but Dr. <hi>Abbot</hi>) because he refused to make that good by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, which the King had done against the Laws. <hi>He imprisoned Dr.</hi> Williams <hi>Bishop of</hi> Lincoln, for speaking against the <hi>Loane</hi> and not prosecuting <hi>Puritans.</hi>

                  <q>VI. <hi>He turned out the Lord Chief Iustice</hi> Crew <hi>for opposing the</hi> Loane.</q>

               <p n="7">
                  <q>VII. He remitted 30000l. to <hi>Holland</hi> for the Levying Horse and Men there, to serve his Arbitrary purposes.</q>

               <p n="8">
                  <q>VIII. He violated <hi>the Petition of Right,</hi> so soon as it was passed into a Law.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="9">
                  <q>IX. He confined the <hi>Earl of</hi> Bristol near two years, without any Accusation; and he <hi>Imprisoned the Earl of</hi> Arundel in the time of <hi>Parliament,</hi> without expressing any Cause of his Commitment.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="10">
                  <q>X. He shelter'd the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Buckingham</hi> when he was Prosecuted in Parliament, as the Patron of a Popish Faction; and he Dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Parliaments when they were intent upon the Duke's Prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and charged him in effect with <hi>the Murder of King Iames</hi>; In Relation whereunto, Sir <hi>Edward Peyton</hi> who was a Member of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament in that time, doth thus express himself in a Treatise called the <hi>Divine Catastrophe</hi>; The Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> rewarded King <hi>Iames</hi> by Poyson, as appeared plainly in Parliament by the Evidence of divers Physitians, especially Dr. <hi>Ramsey</hi>; and King <hi>Charles,</hi> to save the Duke, dissolved the Parliament when he was Impeached for it, and never after had the Truth Tryed, to clear himself from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy, or the Duke from so heinous a scandal.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="11">
                  <q>XI. <hi>He imprisoned Members of Parliament</hi> in the time of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for refusing to Answer out of the Parliament, what was said and done there, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>You may here see Sir, to your shame (had you any) what a small advance you have made, in the defence of that Cause which you so briskly engaged in; and how much of your Work you have devolved upon your better <hi>Pens.</hi> Before I take my leave of you, I shall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve

               <p>No more at present (dear Doctor) only I acquaint you at parting, that I am sensible I have not paid you the Tithe of what I owe you, but it lies ready for you, when you shall draw a Bill upon</p>
