         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Ambitious vanities</hi> are never ſeaſonable or comely for any humble Chriſtians, and leaſt for the Miniſters of Chriſt, (who ought to be <hi>crucified to the world,</hi> and the world to them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.14.) eſpecially at my years, and in my condition.

(for truly it is an adventure, and no ſmall one in this age) thus to appeare in <hi>publique,</hi> poſsibly with more forwardneſſe and zeale, than prudence and diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in ſome mens cenſure; Who (it may be) have not ſo much charity or courage in them, as to own an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted <hi>friend,</hi> an impoveriſhed <hi>father,</hi> or a diſtreſſed <hi>mother.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet to juſtifie my <hi>diſcretion,</hi> this may be ſaid, That nothing ſeems to me (in Policy as well as Piety) more rationally and religiouſly neceſſary, than a publique ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der regard to the ſtate of the <hi>Reformed Religion</hi> in this Church and Nation.

            <p>Not, but that I have (alſo) pleaſing ſpeculations (many times) of that <hi>ſilent ſafetie</hi> and <hi>ſecure latencie,</hi> in which I ſee others, my betters or equals, hug themſelves.

               <p>Hence, firſt <hi>Eraſtians</hi> or Polititians begin to reſolve all Churches into States, all Miniſtry into Magiſtracy; making no other ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine of <hi>Church-power</hi> than that of the <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> nor of any <hi>Miniſters, Biſhops</hi> or <hi>Presbyters</hi> Authority than of a <hi>Juſtice,</hi> or a <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,</hi> or a <hi>Conſtable.</hi>

               <p>Mr. <hi>Richard Hooker</hi> (one of the ableſt Pens and beſt Spirits that ever <hi>England</hi> employed or enjoyed) hath (beſides many other wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy men) abundantly examined every feature and dreſs of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> aſſerting it by calm, clear and unanſwerable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations of Reaſon and <hi>Scripture,</hi> to have been very far from having any thing unchriſtian or uncomely, deformed or intolerable, which her (then) enemies declaimed, and now have proclaimed; whoſe wrathfull menaces the <hi>meekneſs</hi> and <hi>wiſdome</hi> of that good man foreſaw, and in his Epiſtle foretold, would <hi>be very fierce and cruell,</hi> if once they got power anſwerable to their <hi>prejudices, ſuperſtitions</hi> and <hi>paſsions</hi> againſt the <hi>Church of England</hi>; which he fully proved to differ no more from the Primitive temper and prudence, than was either lawfull, convenient, or neceſſary in the variation of times and occaſions.</p>
               <p>The excellent endeavours of that <hi>rarely-learned</hi> and <hi>godly Divine</hi> (ſo full of the ſpirit and wiſdome of Chriſt) one would have thought might have been ſufficient for ever to have kept up the peace, order and honour of the <hi>Church of England</hi>; alſo to have ſilenced the pratings and petulancies of her adverſaries. But (alas) few of thoſe <hi>plebeian ſpirits</hi> and weaker capacities (to whoſe errour, anger and activity the <hi>Church of England</hi> now chiefly owes her miſeries, tears and fears) were ever able to underſtand, or bear away the <hi>weight, ſtrength</hi> and <hi>profoundneſſe</hi> of that moſt ample mans reaſonings, and his eloquent writings.</p>
               <p>Others of them, that were more able, were ſo cunning and partiall for the intereſt of their cauſe and faction, as (commonly) to decry for obſcure, or to ſuſpect as dangerous, becauſe prejudiciall to their intereſt, or to bury in ſilence, as their enemy, that rare piece of Mr. <hi>Hookers Eccleſiaſticall Polity,</hi> which many of them had ſeldome either the courage or the honeſty to read; none of them the power ever to reply, or the hardineſs ſo much as to endeavour a juſt confutation of his mighty demonſtrations.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:97412:61"/>Yea, I have been credibly informed, that ſome of the then-diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from the <hi>Church of England</hi> had the good (or rather evil) for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, utterly to ſuppreſs thoſe (now defective, but by him promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and performed) books touching the vindication of the <hi>Church of England</hi> in its <hi>Ordination, Juriſdiction</hi> and <hi>Government,</hi> by the <hi>way of Ancient, Catholick, Primitive</hi> and <hi>Apoſtolick Epiſcopacy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which one word (<hi>Epiſcopacy</hi>) hath of late years coſt more blood and treaſure in <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> than all the enemies of Biſhops and of this Church had in their veins, or were worth, 20. years ago: whoſe importune clamours of old, and endeavours of late to extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate <hi>Primitive, Catholick</hi> and <hi>Apoſtolicall Epiſcopacy</hi> out of <hi>this Church,</hi> and to introduce by head and ſhoulders the <hi>exotick novelties</hi> and vanities of humane invention, have brought themſelves and this whole <hi>Church</hi> to ſo various and divided a poſture, as makes no ſetled or uniform <hi>Church-government</hi> at all; by a popular precipitancy rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning an ancient and goodly Fabrick (whoſe temporary decayes or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects might eaſily and wiſely have been amended) before they had agreed of a new model, or ſeriouſly conſidered either their skill or their authority to erect a new one, if they could find out a better, which hitherto they have not done, nor will they, I believe, ever be able to do; as deſtitute in this point of any juſt commiſſion, direction, power, or precedent either from God or man. I am ſure the Supreme power of regulating all Eccleſiaſticall affairs, was, under God, by the laws of <hi>England</hi> inveſted in the Chief Magiſtrate, and Governours of <hi>this Church</hi>; without and againſt whoſe judgements, conſents and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, no innovations were to be carried on, nor indeed begun in this Church: whoſe events or ſucceſſes hitherto have been only wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of ſuch tumultuary beginnings; the effects of them being full of diſſolution &amp; confuſion to all, of injurious afflictions to many worthy men, beſides penall and perpetuall diviſions among the Innovators themſelves; who varying in this, as in other things, from the whole ancient Churches conſtitution, no leſs than from this of <hi>England,</hi> are likely to differ among themſelves even till Doomeſday, unleſs they return, under ſome new name, and diſguiſed notion of moderators and ſuperintendents, to what they have raſhly deſerted, the true pattern in the Mount, that paternall, Primitive and <hi>Catholick Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy,</hi> which was the centre and crown of the Churches unity, peace, order and honour, which imports no more (after all this cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and terrour) than one grave and worthy Presbyter duly choſen in the ſeverall Dioceſes &amp; limits, to be the chief Eccleſiaſtick Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeer and <hi>Governour,</hi> ſucceeding in the managing of that Eccleſiaſticall power and authority, which, without an Apoſtolick Preſident or Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop properly ſo called, Presbyters alone in parity or equality never did enjoy, and ſo never ought to exerciſe in the Churches of Chriſt, as to <hi>ordination</hi> and <hi>juriſdiction,</hi> no more than Biſhops regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly may without the counſel and aſſiſtance of Presbyters.</p>
               <p>Which ancient Order, &amp; eminent Authority of Primitive <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> if neither right Reaſon, nor the Word of God, either in the Old or
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:97412:61"/>
New Teſtament, did clearly ſet forth to us as beſt; if neither Apoſtles at firſt, nor the Primitive Fathers after them; if neither Church-hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, nor Catholick cuſtome, nor Primitive Antiquity, nor the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of the beſt Reformed Churches and Divines; if all theſe did not commend it, as they evidently do (to my beſt underſtanding:) yet the late mad and ſad <hi>extravagancies in Religion</hi> do highly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it; yea, the great want of it in <hi>England</hi> ſhews the great uſe, neceſſity and excellency of it, eſpecially if advanced to its greateſt improvement of counſel, order and authority. I may adde the votes of all ſober and impartiall Chriſtians, even now in <hi>England,</hi> who are grown ſo wiſe by their woes, as generally to wiſh for ſuch <hi>Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> whoſe reſtitution would be more welcome to the wiſer and better ſort of Chriſtians in this nation, than ever the removall of it was, or the medlies of Presbytery and Independency is like to be. Nor do I believe that the reſtauration of a right <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> would be unaccep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to many of the ſobereſt men even of thoſe two parties, if any expedient could be found, to ſalve and redeem the reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſome lay-leaders and popular <hi>Primates</hi> of thoſe ſides; whoſe credits lie much at pawn with the people, upon this very ſcore, as having been by them raſhly biaſſed againſt all <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi>: the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſing of which Apoſtolick order on one ſide, and the aboliſhing of it on the other ſide, were, I think, two of the greateſt Engines the Devil uſed to batter the Church of Chriſt withall; pride and parity, inſolency and Anarchy, being equally pernicious to Church-polity and Chriſtian piety.</p>

               <p>As to the ſubſtance and matter of this <hi>Book,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The matter of the <hi>Engliſh Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie.</hi>
                  </note> the wiſdome of the <hi>Church of Engl.</hi> had firſt exactly <hi>adjuſted</hi> it to the ſenſe of <hi>Gods word</hi>; nothing being there expreſſed, as the <hi>mind of the Church,</hi> which was not thought agreeable to the <hi>mind of Gods ſpirit</hi> in the Scriptures: nor do I know any part of it, to which a judicious Chriſtian might not in <hi>faith</hi> ſay <hi>Amen,</hi> taking the expreſſions of it in that pious and benigne ſenſe, which the Church intended, and the words may well beare.</p>
               <p>Next, all the parts of it were ſo fitted (both as to the <hi>language,</hi> and the things contained in it) to <hi>ordinary peoples capacities,</hi> as well as all mens neceſſities, that none had cauſe to complain of it, as hard to be underſtood, nor any to diſdain it, as too flat and eaſie.</p>
               <p>Indeed, the whole compoſure of the <hi>Engliſh Liturgie</hi> was (in my judgement) ſo holy, ſo wholſome, ſo handſome, ſo complete, ſo diſcreet, ſo devout, that I cannot but eſteem it equal at leaſt to (yea I am prone (with <hi>Gilbertus</hi> the German) much to prefer it before) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one <hi>Liturgie</hi> or publick form of <hi>ſerving God,</hi> uſed in any <hi>Church,</hi> ancient or later, in <hi>Eaſtern</hi> or <hi>Weſtern, Greek</hi> or <hi>Latin, Romiſh</hi> or <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,</hi> that ever I ſaw.</p>
               <p>Let any ſober Chriſtian, that is able, compare the <hi>Liturgie of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> with thoſe now extant; as the <hi>Armenian,</hi> the <hi>Constantinopolitan,</hi>

               <p>As for the <hi>Engliſh Liturgies</hi> ſymbolizing with the <hi>Popiſh Miſſall,</hi> as ſome have odiouſly and falſely calumniated; it doth no more, than our <hi>Communion</hi> or <hi>Lords Supper</hi> celebrated in <hi>England,</hi> doth with the <hi>Maſse</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi>; or our doctrine about the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> doth with theirs about <hi>Tranſubstantiation,</hi> or our humble veneration of our God and Saviour in that <hi>myſterie,</hi> doth with their ſtrange Geſticulations and Superſtitions. In all which particulars, how much the <hi>Church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> differed both in Doctrine and Devotion from that of <hi>Rome,</hi> no man that is intelligent and honeſt can either deny or diſſemble. I am ſure we differ as much as <hi>Engliſh</hi> doth from <hi>Latin,</hi> Truth from Errour, true Antiquity from Novelty, Completeneſs from Defect, Sanctity from Sacriledge, the giving of the Cup to the people from the denying of it; as much as the holy uſe of things doth from the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious abuſe of them; as much as Divine Faith doth from Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Fancy, or <hi>Scripture</hi>-plainneſſe and proportions from <hi>Scholaſtick</hi> ſubtilties and inventions.</p>
               <p>That the <hi>Church of England</hi> retained many things pious and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to ſeverall occaſions, which the <hi>Roman Devotionalls</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and retained from the ancient <hi>Liturgies,</hi> is no more blamable, than that we uſe and preſerve thoſe Scriptures, <hi>Sacraments,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther holy Services, which the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> doth now profeſs to ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate and uſe.

                  <note place="margin">1 Theſ. 5 21.</note>

phraſes and expreſſions, as leſs proper and emphatick. It is now an hundred years old, and able to ſpeak for it ſelf; juſtly alledging firſt the great joy, &amp; devotion, the piety &amp; thanks with which it was firſt received as an wholſome form of Prayer, eaſie to be underſtood by Engliſh Chriſtians; next, the great good it at firſt did, &amp; ever ſince hath done for many years to many poor ſilly ſouls, who otherwaies had been left in great blindneſs and <hi>barrenneſſe of devotion.</hi> Further, it pleads, that it never intended to offend any good Chriſtian, ſince it ſtudied in all things to be <hi>conſonant to Gods holy will and word:</hi> that as its order, premeditatedneſs, and conſtancy of devotion, was never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden or diſſallowed by God, or any good men, <hi>Jews</hi> of old, or <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> of later times, but rather approved, exemplified and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in all their publick ſervices, both of prayers, praiſes and benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; ſo late experience abundantly teacheth, how much the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of true Reformed Religion were generally carried on more happily by the publick and private uſe of that Liturgie, than hath been of late years by the rejecting of it, as many have done, and introducing in its ſtead nothing but their own crude and extempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry prayers; which being much unpremeditated are many times ſo confuſed, ſo flat, ſo flaſhy, ſo affected, ſo prepoſterous, ſo improper, ſo indiſcreet, ſo incomplete, that they grow oft-times ridiculous, ſometimes profane bablings and battologies,<note place="margin">Matth. 6.7.</note> condemned by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, when thoſe men affect in publick extemporary prayers, who have neither invention for the variety, nor judgement for the ſolidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, nor diſcretion for that gravity, fitneſs and decency which are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in all our prayers, eſpecially when publick and ſocial. For ſome to pretend ſpeciall and immediate inſpirations, and divine dictates in their prayers, is ſo impudent an impoſturage, that they may as well obtrude all they pray and preach for new Oracles of God, and grounds of infallible verity; for ſuch are the Dictates of Gods Spirit, not mixed with any thing of our own abilities.</p>
               <p>The verbal diſlikes which ſome had againſt the words and phraſes of the <hi>Liturgie</hi> are eaſily ſalved, if men will but conſider the uſual ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificancy of them at that time when the <hi>pious</hi> and <hi>prudent</hi> compoſers of it applied them to expreſs their conceptions to common people. Words, as all things ſublunary, have their varyings and alterations, even as to the benignity and property of their ſenſe. They are pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full feeble Chriſtians that ſtumble at ſuch ſtraws, for want of ſo much candor and diſcretion in their devotions, as muſt be allowed in ordinary uſage and civility to the changeableneſs of all <hi>Languages</hi>; which occaſions ſo many new tranſlations of the Bible, as to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of ſome words, which time at length makes leſs proper, ſignificant, or comely. It argues, the enemies of the Liturgie had no great fault to find with the <hi>matter</hi> of it, in that they ſo carped at the words and <hi>manner</hi> of it; which (conſidering the ſpeech and oratory of thoſe plainer times) was not onely good and grave, but very apt and ſignificant, full of <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>pathetick expreſsions,</hi> ſuch as were moſt fit, as to inform all peoples underſtandings, ſo to excite their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:97412:64"/>
and quicken their united devotions.</p>
               <p>Indeed, the <hi>rejection of this Liturgie,</hi> as to publick uſe, hath depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved multitudes of poor people of an excellent help, both to prayer and all other duties of piety, as well private as publick; without any valid grounds of Reaſon or Religion alledged by any, that I have ſeen, to juſtifie their ſo doing. I believe the greateſt fault (in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt) that the more lazy, wanton and nauſeating tempers of moſt men and women found in it was, <hi>its length</hi> and <hi>ſolemnity,</hi> which they thought tedious, as taking up too much of their time; yet ſure not ſo much as did any way exclude the exerciſe of Miniſters either pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or preaching gifts; of which ſome were jealous. But a more ſoft and delicate generation of Chriſtians of later years is ſprung up, which hath found out a more eaſie and compendious way of Devotion, which ſerves their turns, and muſt be (now) obtruded upon all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: for inſtead of ſo many <hi>Pſalms, Chapters, Commandements, Creeds, Collects, Litanies, Epiſtles</hi> and <hi>Goſpels, conſtant</hi> and <hi>occaſionall Prayers,</hi> which in the <hi>Liturgie</hi> of the <hi>Church of England</hi> were preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, men now make up their <hi>oriſons</hi> in <hi>ſmaller cocks,</hi> and bind up their <hi>devotions</hi> in far leſſer <hi>volumes</hi> than the Ancients uſed; contenting themſelves (for the moſt part) either with long Prayers and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of their own invention &amp; compoſure, without reading any part of the holy Scripture, or with ſuch as are not now ſo prolix &amp; tedious, as the faſhion ſometime was, when weak men firſt affected publickly to exerciſe and ſhew their rare <hi>faculty</hi> that way; which (truly) after the rate of ſome mens performing, is ſo very vulgar, empty and eaſie, that if a wiſe, learned and grave man could, yet for ſhame he would not ſo far expoſe Prayer and Preaching to vulgar irreverence, as ſome men have done, by ſeeking to out-do the Devotionalls of the <hi>Church of England.</hi> So that the pride and perfunctorineſs of thoſe popular af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectations being now much diſcovered, the graver ſort even of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiliturgicall Preachers</hi> and people too, either confine themſelves to a more conſtant method and form of prayer; or they vary ſo little, ſo cunningly and ſo eaſily, that the beſt of their prayers in their <hi>grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt latitude</hi> for matter and variety, is not beyond what may be paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel'd <hi>in the Engliſh Liturgie,</hi> and was to be fully enjoyed by its help and conſtancy.</p>
               <p>Whoſe <hi>cold entertainment</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and diſorderly rejection by ſome in <hi>England,</hi> as they did at once highly juſtifie the <hi>Papiſts</hi> for their former <hi>Recuſancy,</hi> &amp; gratifie their future deſignes by reproching the <hi>Church of England,</hi> yea openly condemning here all our refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Predeceſſors, for ſerving God ſo amiſs, that it is not now ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther longer tolerable or excuſable in any Reaſon or Religion, Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence or Prudence: ſo with unpaſſionate Chriſtians all this doth not leſſen the ſacred dignity and reall worth of the <hi>Engliſh Liturgie,</hi> which is, and ever will be famous at home and abroad, among ſober, wiſe, and impartiall Chriſtians, who know how to ſerve God (<gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Which Divine warrants, as the ancient Chriſtians in all Churches generally owned and followed, as ſufficient authority for their <hi>ſet Liturgies</hi>; according to which <hi>Conſtantine the Great,</hi> as <hi>Euſebius</hi> tells us in his life, <hi>l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 19. preſcribed to his Chriſtian Souldiers one ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne form of Latin Service; yea our late Anti-liturgiſts thought ſet forms of prayer might do well at ſea, though not at land: So the <hi>Church of England</hi> is not therefore to be blamed, becauſe ſome mens peeviſhneſs or petulancy hath pleaſed themſelves in diſgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing as well as diſuſing that holy and good way, rather anſwering, I fear, the wantonneſs of their own and other peoples hearts, than any way ſeriouſly conſidering the ſad inconveniences following the want of ſuch <hi>wholſome forms,</hi> to be frequently inculcated upon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon peoples <hi>underſtandings,</hi> the better to inure their memories, and to work upon their affections; whom new and unwonted peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions rather looſe and confound, than ſo inform and affect, as <hi>prayer</hi> ſhould do; few capacities among plain people going ſo faſt as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans tongue, where uſually a freſh petition crowds out the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, before ever poor dull people have leiſure to underſtand what it meant, or can in judgement and faith ſay <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is not worth my anſwering, what ſome alledge againſt the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie,</hi> that many godly people were weary of it, that they could now go alone, and ſo might well caſt away their wooden legs, ſtilts or crutches.</p>
               <p>Yet by way of anſwer I may truly affirm, that this was not, nor ever will be, the happineſs of all or moſt Chriſtian people in this nation, or elſewhere, to go upon their own legs, without any ſtay or ſtaff; which might well help the weaker, and I am ſure could not hurt or hinder the ſtronger, who may upon the ſame pretenſions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe the benefit of any one Miniſters moſt extemporary prayer, which to the hearers hath the ſame aſpect of a crutch or ſtaff, no leſs than that ſet form which by many is compoſed and propoſed to the congregation.</p>
               <p>As for the humours of <hi>common people,</hi> they are an ill compaſs to ſteer by in concernments of <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>State.</hi> It is no wonder to ſee wontedneſs breed wearineſs, and wearineſs wantonneſs, &amp; wantonneſs loathing of the moſt holy duties, and heavenly dainties (as of <hi>Manna</hi> to the Jews) unleſs the hearts of men be alwaies humbly devout, and ſincerely fervent: and ſuch can (I am ſure) daily follow <hi>wonted wholſome forms</hi> with <hi>new fervours,</hi> and give a freſh <hi>Amen</hi> to known &amp; oft-repeated petitions, as well as a fiduciary aſſent to ſuch precepts

               <p>This I am ſure, The <hi>Liturgie</hi> of the <hi>Church of England</hi> was ſo uſefull, ſo well adviſed, ſo ſavoury, ſo complete, ſo ſuitable, ſo ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn and ſo ſignificant a form of <hi>publick Worſhipping</hi> God, ſo highly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by wiſe and worthy men, at home and abroad, as compoſed by the ſpeciall aſſiſtance of the <hi>holy Spirit</hi> of God in the judgement of the firſt <hi>Heroes</hi> and Martyrs of this Reformed Church, ſo reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently uſed by many even leſſe conformable (in ſome things cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall) to the <hi>Church of England,</hi> that (beyond all queſtion) it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved a longer queſtion, a more calm debate, a more ſerene, ſerious and impartiall triall, before it ſhould have been ſo utterly <hi>abdicated</hi> or expulſed out of the <hi>Church,</hi> as <hi>Hagar</hi> was out of <hi>Abrahams</hi> fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. I humbly conceive that neither <hi>Recuſants</hi> ſhould have had ſo great a gratification to their <hi>refractorineſs,</hi> nor this ſo famous, flouriſhing and wel-<hi>Reformed Church</hi> ſhould have had ſo great a ſlurr &amp; aſperſion caſt upon its <hi>Princes,</hi> its <hi>Parlaments,</hi> its <hi>Biſhops,</hi> its <hi>Preſbyters,</hi> &amp; all its faithfull people: as if they had hitherto ſerved God ſo far ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitiouſly, irreligiouſly and unworthily, that the <hi>very Book</hi> it ſelf, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the method, form, matter and words of their publick ſervice of God, muſt be firſt vilified and ſcorned by the <hi>vulgar</hi> inſolency; next utterly abrogated and quite ejected out of this Church, by ſuch as paſſionately undertook to abett and patronize the preſent humours and diſtempered fits of popular ſurfeitings and inconſtancy, lately riſen up, not onely againſt their own former approbation and practiſe, but againſt the piety, wiſdome and gravity of this Nation, and all other ſetled Churches in the world.</p>
               <p>Yea further, the partiality and <hi>immoderation</hi> of ſome men ſeems in this moſt <hi>exceſsive</hi>; that, to ſhew their implacable deſpite againſt the <hi>Liturgie of the Church of England,</hi> they cannot endure, nor would, if they had power, permit any Chriſtians to uſe it, though they find it (as our <hi>Marian</hi> Martyrs did) very <hi>beneficiall</hi> to their ſouls comfort, and therefore earneſtly deſire, highly value, and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſe it. So <hi>imperious Dictators</hi> would ſome men be over other mens liberties and conſciences, even in Religion, who are rigid aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerters of their own, impatient to be impoſed upon by others; and yet moſt inſolently ambitious to impoſe upon other men, how far they may, or may not <hi>ſerve God</hi> in a religious way and manner, fancying, that nothing can pleaſe God which doth not pleaſe them.</p>

Hence it is that poor countrey-people are grown of late years more looſe and unſetled, ſo igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and idle, ſo rambling and irreligious, beyond what formerly they were, when (at leaſt) they were enjoyned to attend the <hi>whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Liturgie</hi> of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> which offered plainly to them, as I conceive, all things neceſſary to entertain any humble, charitable and devout Chriſtians, in their publick ſervices of God; nor could it but be very helpfull to them in their private devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>For my own particular, it may be (by Gods aſſiſtance) I may as little need this <hi>Liturgie,</hi> or any other <hi>preſcribed form,</hi> as any of thoſe Miniſters or other Chriſtians that are moſt contemners and deſerters of the <hi>Church of England</hi> in that point, and moſt gloriers in their own rare <hi>gift</hi> or <hi>fluency in prayer:</hi> yet I muſt profeſs, that as I ever highly valued the <hi>Liturgie</hi> of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and moſt, ſince it came moſt to be deſpiſed by ſome, neglected by others, &amp; conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by my ſelf; ſo I cannot but unfeignedly juſtifie the <hi>Church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>'s great piety, prudence and charity in that particular; looking upon ſuch well-compoſed forms, in publick, ſolemn and conſtant Miniſtrations of the Church, to be (in many regards) before thoſe of any private mans either ſerious compoſing or ſuddain invention, not onely as to the majeſty, ſolemnity, exactneſs, unanimity and fulneſs of them, alſo as to the ſuitableneſs of them both to all holy pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick occaſions, and to the common peoples neceſſities, as well as ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities; but even in regard of that which is moſt ſpirituall in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:97412:66"/>
judicious fervour and fiduciary aſſent, where the underſtanding rightly moves the will, and the will readily follows the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; the devout ſoul well knowing what it ſhould deſire of God, and earneſtly deſiring in faith what it knows God allows. It cannot be thought that the Spirit of the moſt wiſe God is ſeen in the unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditated raſhneſs of mens praying, or ſuch preaching, more than in what is well adviſed, and deliberately prepared.</p>
               <p>Which in <hi>Liturgies</hi> was and is, in my judgement, an excellent means (and ſo the charitable wiſdome of the <hi>Church of England</hi> jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged it) as to ſettle people in the <hi>true faith,</hi> ſo to keep them in it with peace and unity, by a uniform Way of inſtruction and devotion too; which was eaſie to be underſtood by the ſimpleſt people, and unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly both compoſed and approved by the wiſeſt and beſt in this Church. Nor could it but be in that, as in all other reſpects, well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to God, who certainly doth not change with every new opinion, fancy and humour of men, be they never ſo zealous and ſeemingly devout. So that to conclude, as to this particular, the <hi>Liturgie</hi> of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> I freely profeſs, that I do in no ſort believe, that either God hath afflicted <hi>Her</hi> for compoſing, enjoyning and uſing It; or that ſhe hath hereby deſerved any of thoſe rude <hi>indignities,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proches and injuries caſt upon Her and It.</p>
               <p>The greateſt fault and onely blame as I conceive, in this part, lies upon mens <hi>own hearts,</hi> which were grown ſo ſqueamiſh, ſo cold, ſo coy, ſo formall, ſo indevout in the uſe of the <hi>Liturgie,</hi> as a part of Gods ſervice: which faults and defects in themſelves ought not to have been by them imputed to, or revenged ſo ſeverely upon the <hi>book and compoſure</hi> it ſelf, or upon the <hi>Church</hi> compoſing and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it to its Children. But the inſolencies of ſome rude <hi>Reformers,</hi> contemning, tearing, burning and aboliſhing the <hi>Liturgie</hi> of this Church, muſt be veniall; ſince there are thoſe that uſe the very book of God, or holy <hi>Bible,</hi> no better, calling it an Idol, and condemning it to be deſtroyed: poſſibly more becauſe it is in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is <hi>Gods Book</hi>; which if lock'd up in an <hi>unknown</hi> tongue, would leſs diſcover and brand with ſin their wicked practiſes and policies, than now it doth. The ſame grand intereſt that is moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Engliſh Liturgie,</hi> is alſo againſt our <hi>Engliſh Bibles</hi>: both of them were great eye-ſores to the Papiſts, and are now no leſs to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny factious Separatiſts, who are the Jackals or Providores for thoſe Lions.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The firſt is the enjoyning and uſing of <hi>ſome Ceremonies</hi> in <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> which ſome eſteem as ſo many <hi>Magick Spells</hi> or <hi>Charms,</hi> ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Obſervations, humane Inventions, <hi>raggs of Rome, will-worſhip, vain Oblations, brats of Babylon,</hi> marks of the Beaſt, brands of Antichriſt; fitter for Heatheniſh <hi>Idolatries,</hi> or Jewiſh Superſtitions, than for the <hi>ſimplicity of the Goſpel,</hi> where the ſervice of God muſt be in Spirit and in Truth, not in fleſhly ſhadowes; in power, not in form, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Theſe and the like <hi>Rhetoricall flowers</hi> are oft uſed to gratifie mens wits and paſſions, rather than their reaſon and conſcience, in the point of Ceremonies, when they are reſolved not to poiſe in their hands, but to trample under their feet, every thing they liſt to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like; notwithſtanding all the counterpoiſe and weight which they could not but ſee was laid upon them by the <hi>choice</hi> wiſdome and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of this whole <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Nation</hi>; in which we may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out vanity preſume there were many men as godly and judicious as any of their oppoſers.</p>
               <p>I will not deſcend to the particular nature and uſe of each of them: This work hath been ſufficiently done by many of my predeceſſors. I confeſſe I am not ſo zealous for thoſe, or any other <hi>Ceremonies</hi> (which may be ſpared without diminiſhing the ſubſtance of Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) as to forget that forbearance and charity which I owe to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who may be weak &amp; conſcientiouſly ſcrupulous: nor yet am I ſo againſt theſe, or any other innocent <hi>Ceremonies</hi> recommended in any Church, by the joynt conſent <hi>of all parties,</hi> and by due authority, as for their ſakes to withdraw my humble ſubjection to, and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table communion with this or any <hi>other Chriſtian Church</hi> in the world, that is otherwiſe ſound in the Faith. I do not ſo affect <hi>em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broyderies</hi> in <hi>Religion,</hi> as to have its garments too gay and heavy, with the <hi>Church of Rome</hi>: nor yet do I ſo affect a plainneſs, as to abhorre all decency:<note place="margin">

               <p>As to the generall nature of <hi>Ceremonies</hi> uſed in the <hi>Church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:97412:67"/>
it may ſuffice, at preſent, in order to <hi>vindicate this Church,</hi> to declare in its behalf, Firſt, that the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> enjoyned and uſed in the <hi>Church of England</hi> were eſteemed,<note place="margin">See Dr. <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> his Book of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and what K. <hi>James</hi> declared tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching them, as the ſenſe of this Church.</note> and oft ſo declared to be in the ſenſe of <hi>the Church,</hi> and <hi>its chief Governours,</hi> not at all of the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence or neceſſary ſubſtance of any religious duty, no more than the clothes of their oppoſers were of their conſtitution, or their hair was of their heads; yet both clothes and hair are very comely and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient in the ſociall living both of men and Chriſtians together, where neither nakedneſſe (I think) nor baldneſſe would become them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It doth no where appear that our bleſſed God is ſo <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti-ceremoniall a God</hi> as ſome men have vehemently fancied and cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured, rather than proved. This I am ſure, the God of heaven, whom we worſhipped in <hi>England,</hi> did inſtitute many <hi>Ceremonies</hi> in the ancient religious ſervices required of the <hi>Jewiſh Church</hi>; which certainly God would not have done, if all <hi>Ceremonies</hi> had been ſo ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly Anti-patheticall againſt the Divine nature, or contrary to that <hi>ſpirituall ſincere worſhip,</hi> which he anciently required (beyond all doubt) of the Jew as well as the Chriſtian,<note place="margin">Iſa. 1.11, 12, &amp;c. Mic. 6.7, &amp;c. Iſa. 58.5, &amp;c.</note> as all the Prophets wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p>Nor do we find that God hath any where forbidden any decent Rites, holy Cuſtomes, or convenient <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> to any Chriſtians, in order to advance the decency and order of his ſervice, or Chriſtians mutuall edification and joynt devotion under the Goſpel; except onely ſuch as were like the ſhadows of the night or morning, which went before the riſing of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> the Sun of Righteouſneſſe,<note place="margin">Mal. 4.2.</note> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting Chriſts <hi>not being yet come in the fleſh,</hi> or implying the myſtery of mans Redemption not yet completed by the <hi>Meſsias:</hi> ſuch as were <hi>Circumciſion,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Moſaick Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> as the <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> the <hi>Paſſeover,</hi> the <hi>High Prieſt,</hi> and other legall Types, as fore-going ſhadows, juſtly vaniſhed when the ſubſtance came<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but thoſe <hi>ſubſequent ſhadowes, Evangelicall Ceremonies</hi> and <hi>Signs,</hi> which follow, attend upon, and betoken the <hi>Suns</hi> being now riſen, and preſent with his Church, theſe in point of outward order and decency, alſo of inward ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy and edification, may well conſiſt with the <hi>Evangelicall worſhip</hi> of God in Spirit and Truth, however it be not founded on them, or confined to them, as to the inward judgement and conſcience of the worſhippers.</p>

Elder years do moroſely reſolve to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain what once they have adopted under the name of ſtricter piety and purer <hi>Religion.</hi> Few men know how to revert or recant, when once engaged in a party or difference which carries any mark or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of a <hi>ſpeciall way of Religion.

               <p>I have known ſome Miniſters of worth and ability, who in all things materiall agreed to the doctrine and worſhip of the <hi>Church of Engl.</hi> yet in point of <hi>non-conformity</hi> to ſome Ceremony, rather choſe (being once engaged before they had ſo well examined all things) to live a ſcrambling, vagrant, and almoſt mendicant life, from one good houſe to another (by which means ſome of them ſucked no ſmall benefit) rather than they would take any ſetled living in the <hi>Church of England</hi>; in which obſtinacy they perſiſted to their dying day: although they grew very calme and coole as to their firſt heats; and perceiving in time the weakneſſe of their own and others mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, they durſt not in their maturer years perſwade any others, no not their own ſons, which were <hi>Ministers in the Church of England,</hi> to be non-conformiſts, onely they were aſhamed to be retrograde in their reputation, though they were got well forward in their better judgements.</p>
               <p>Yea, even as to the <hi>polle</hi> and <hi>number of names</hi> (which I think to be but the <hi>number of the Beaſt,</hi> if we onely <hi>tell noſes,</hi> and not conſider <hi>reaſons</hi>) who knows not but the <hi>conformable part</hi> both of <hi>Miniſters and people in England,</hi> were, for many years, twenty to one beyond the <hi>Non-conformiſts?</hi> nor did they more exceed them in number, than they equalled them every way in learning, piety, gravity, in all good words and works; yea in many things of publick and more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous charity they far exceeded them: the one were, for the moſt part, getting and ſcraping for their private advantages; the other were much more hoſpitable, munificent and charitable.</p>
               <p>The firſt and ſecond generation of <hi>Non-conformiſts</hi> were more excuſable, and more modeſt in their diſſentings: for, coming newly out of not onely the <hi>dungeon</hi> of <hi>Papall ſuperſtition</hi> and darkneſs to a <hi>marvellous light</hi> of <hi>Reformation,</hi> they were jealous of any cloud or ſhadow which they ſuſpected as threatning to <hi>eclipſe</hi> that light; but coming alſo out of the <hi>fiery furnace of Romiſh perſecution,</hi> they were jealous of every thing that had once paſt the <hi>Popes fingers,</hi> leſt it might be too hot for them. Theſe <hi>good and warm men</hi> (to whoſe <hi>mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrly courage</hi> much might be indulged) while yet <hi>Reformation</hi> was an <hi>Embryo</hi> (in the formation and birth) were in time much worn out; men afterward began more coolely to conſider the nature of the things, no leſs than their own fears or other mens prejudices, eſpecially af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they ſaw thoſe things three times ſolemnly determined and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the publick wiſdome and authority both of this Church and

State. The few remains of the old ſtock of pious diſſenters (which in my time I have known) were grown ſo calm and moderate, as to the <hi>Ceremonies of the Church of England,</hi> that I never found they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded others againſt them. As for <hi>Liturgie</hi> and <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> I am ſure they juſtly aſſerted them, as to the main, as wiſhing onely ſome ſmall ſweetning of the firſt, as to a few darker expreſſions; and the ſoftening of the other, as to ſome more equable <hi>regulations:</hi> which were as far from <hi>extirpation</hi> of either of them, as wiping the eyes is from pulling them out, and waſhing the hands from cutting them off.</p>
               <p>Yea, I know by long experience, that when the graver and more learned ſort of <hi>Non-conformiſts</hi> perceived how mightily the <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Religion</hi> grew and proſpered in <hi>England,</hi> amidſt the <hi>Liturgie, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> againſt which ſome fiercer ſpirits had ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively inveighed; when they ſaw what buds and leaves, bloſſoms and ripe fruit <hi>Aarons</hi> rod brought forth, what eminent gifts and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <hi>God</hi> was pleaſed to diſpenſe by Biſhops and Presbyters, that were piouſly conformable to the <hi>Church of England,</hi> they wholly laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide their former heats and youthfull eagerneſſes; which ſometimes fed high, and were kept warm by the hopes and flatteries of thoſe who expected that party ſhould long agone have prevailed; yea ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them, now aged, both repented of and recanted their more ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venile and indiſcreet fervours, adviſing others, now beginners, to conform to the good orders, and to ſtudy the peace of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> which they ſaw ſo bleſſed of God, as none in the world ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded Her.</p>
               <p>Nor did I ever hear of any ſober Chriſtian, or truly <hi>godly Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> who (being in other things prudent, unblameable and ſincere) did ever ſuffer any <hi>penitentiall ſtrokes,</hi> or <hi>checks of conſcience,</hi> either upon his death-bed or before, meerly upon the account of their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been conformable to, and keeping communion with the <hi>Church of England</hi>; nor did they ever find or complain of <hi>Ceremonies, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie,</hi> or <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> as any damps to their reall graces, or to their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly communion with Gods bleſſed Spirit.

               <p>Yea, while the <hi>Clergie</hi> or <hi>Miniſters of England</hi> do juſtly and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, in the freedome and integrity of their ſouls, thus make their <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent agnitions</hi> to the Divine Juſtice, (every one ſeeing his own ſins in his and the Churches ſufferings, and beſt knowing the plague of his own heart) while they are, with <hi>Daniel,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Firſt, whatſoever the <hi>Clergie of England</hi> (either as Biſhops or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Miniſters) did enjoy and act according to the <hi>lawes eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,</hi> and agreeable to their own conſciences, they are, in thoſe things, not to be blamed in the leaſt kind by any ſober and wife mans cenſure: yet even for theſe chiefly it is, that ſome ſubtil and <hi>ſilly</hi> people do moſt bitterly inveigh againſt them, and in them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this <hi>whole Church and Nation</hi>; which muſt either be guilty with the <hi>Clergie,</hi> or the <hi>Clergie</hi> muſt be free and unblameable with the <hi>Parlaments</hi> and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whole people of the land, who choſe, and by law impoſed ſuch orders upon <hi>themſelves</hi> and their <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, for the <hi>Clergies private failings</hi> and perſonal infirmities, either immorall or indiſcreet, to which, as frail men, they may be ſubject; in theſe they deſire to be the <hi>firſt accuſers,</hi> and <hi>ſevereſt cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurers of themſelves</hi>: which ingenuity is ſufficient to ſilence the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of the worſt, to ſatisfie the juſtice of the beſt, and to merit the pity as well as pardon of all charitable Chriſtians, who are not ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to their own exceſs or defects.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Beyond theſe (which are but perſonal and occaſional, &amp; ſo venial failings) the <hi>Clergie of England</hi> do defie, and challenge their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereſt
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:97412:79"/>
adverſaries, to charge and convince any conſiderable number of them, either in private parties and conventions, or in more publick <hi>Synods</hi> and <hi>Convocations,</hi> of having at any time conſpired to broach or abet any Hereſy or falſe Doctrine, any groſs Errour, <hi>Schiſme</hi> or <hi>Apoſtaſy,</hi> any Immorality or Exorbitancy, contrary to Truth, Faith, and good manners.</p>
               <p>That liberty which ſome of the Clergie conceived might honeſtly be indulged to ſuch people as were tired and exhauſted with hard labour in the <hi>ſix dayes,</hi> for their civil and ſober recreation on the <hi>Lords day,</hi> or <hi>Christian Sabbath,</hi> thereby to counterpoiſe thoſe Jewiſh ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verities which they ſaw ſome men began to urge and obtrude upon Chriſtians, both as to the change and <hi>reſt</hi> of that day; (which quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell is not yet dead in <hi>England</hi>) this (I am prone in charity to believe) neither aroſe from any root of immorality in the adviſers, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended any fruits of impiety in the publiſhers, who were not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant how far in ſuch a <hi>Toleration</hi> they did conform to the judgement, and practiſe too, of ſome <hi>forreign reformed Churches,</hi> and to the chief inſtruments of their <hi>Reformation,</hi> who neither did nor do (even in <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva</hi>) abhor, avoid, or forbid modeſt, honeſt and ſeaſonable recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to ſervants and labouring people on the <hi>Lords day.</hi> Although, for my part, I confeſs, I approve rather, according to the Doctrine of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> in the Homily of the time and place of <hi>pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> that holy &amp; ſtrict obſervance generally uſed by the moſt cautious Chriſtians in <hi>England,</hi> which yet doth allow ſuch ingenuous relaxati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of mind, and motions on <hi>that day,</hi> as are neither impious nor ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, being at once far removed from <hi>Judaick rigours,</hi> and from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh riots; which medium was the ſenſe and practiſe too of the beſt and moſt of the <hi>Clergie</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> as to that one point of the Chriſtian Sabbath, or Lords day, which <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> calls <hi>Sunday,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, ſo ſharply objected againſt ſome of them.</p>
               <p>So then, as to any reall <hi>enormities</hi> of opinions, or ſcandalous pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes in Religion, the <hi>Clergie of England</hi> (taken in their polity and integrality) neither are, nor ever were guilty (ſince the <hi>Reformation</hi>) ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Doctrine, Worſhip, Diſcipline, or Manners: which juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is as clear as the noon-day's light, if not our ſelves, nor our home-bred enemies, but the <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> abroad, or the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and Primitive Churches might be our Judges. None but <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Separatiſts,</hi> or <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> and <hi>Schiſmaticks,</hi> have ever condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned or ſuſpected the <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Clergie of England</hi> of any corruption in Doctrine, of any flaw in the Foundation, of any fraud in holy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, of any allowed <hi>licentiouſneſſe</hi> in our Converſations, of any <hi>undecency</hi> in our Devotions, of any <hi>ſuperſtition</hi> in our religious Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations; in all which, according to the directions of Gods Word, by the aſſiſtance of Gods holy Spirit, through faith in the merits and mediation of the Son of God our onely Saviour Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, we worſhipped the onely true God, who is bleſſed for ever.</p>
               <p>As to the point of <hi>Church-Diſcipline,</hi> wherein ſome men were ſo
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:97412:79"/>
clamorous and importune, as if there had been no health in this Church, becauſe it did not take their phyſick, which it needed not; as the laws had not enjoyned all thoſe <hi>ancient ſeverities</hi> and ſtrictneſſes of <hi>penances,</hi> becauſe neither the temper of the times nor mens ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits would bear them; ſo the <hi>wiſe Biſhops,</hi> and <hi>diſcreet Miniſters</hi> under them, did ſo manage this point of <hi>Church-diſcipline</hi> for many years, by their care and vigilancy, their good doctrine and exemplary lives, their fatherly monitions and charitable corrections (as far as the laws gave them leave) that they happily attained to the reall uſe and beſt end of all <hi>Church-diſcipline,</hi> which is the Churches peace and preſervation in purity and honour, in ſincerity and conſpicuity of true Religion: whoſe intereſts might (poſſibly) have been carried high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as to the point of Diſcipline, if the <hi>Clergie of England</hi> had been furniſhed with ſuch a latitude of power as <hi>Primitive Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters</hi> both enjoyed and exerciſed; which the ſoftneſs and delicacy of this Age would hardly endure, eſpecially when once the paſſions, novelties &amp; ambitions of men were carried on, under the pretexts of Reformation and new Diſcipline; in which ſome men reſolved never to be ſatisfied, till all things fell under the <hi>tuition</hi> and <hi>guber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> of their own factions: unleſs all Church-power be in ſome mens hands, no Church-government is worth a button.</p>
               <p>Not but that the remiſsneſs of ſome <hi>Church-governours,</hi> and the rigours of others (according to their private tempers, judgements and paſſions) might (ſometime) by their exceſſes or defects (poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly) diſpleaſe more calm and moderate men; as warping too much on either hand, from that medium and rectitude of charity, diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, legality and conſtancy, which the <hi>Canons</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> intended, Its conſtitution, health and peace required, eſpecially in the pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhneſs and touchineſs of thoſe times, when many <hi>Philiſtins</hi> and <hi>Dalilahs</hi> lay in wait to betray and deſtroy the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet amidſt theſe ſeeming <hi>exorbitances</hi> of ſome <hi>Church-men,</hi> it may with truth be affirmed, and is by all experience confirmed, that the ſtate of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> and <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> for doctrine, manners and government, for piety, charity and proficiency, was far better, both in <hi>England</hi> and in <hi>Wales,</hi> than it now is, or is ever like to be, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thoſe ſad effects to which ſome mens fury, faction and confuſion ſeek to <hi>reduce this Church.</hi> So then the male-adminiſtrations truly charged upon ſome <hi>Church-governours</hi> heretofore, had not ſo bad an influence upon this Church and the Reformed Religion, as the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter want of able and fit Governours, after the ancient way of Church-government, hath now produced every where.</p>
               <p>For the defects and inordinacies of ſome <hi>private Miniſters</hi> (which can be no wonder, where there were above ten thouſand of them) I neither approve nor patronize them in the leaſt kind; onely I plead in behalf of the whole order and function, as it ſtood in this Churches conſtitution, that a <hi>few Miniſters</hi> faults ought not, in any juſtice or reaſon, to be odiouſly charged upon the <hi>whole Church</hi> or
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:97412:80"/>
their profeſſion, no more than the fall of <hi>ſome Angels</hi> is imputable to the whole <hi>Angelick nature.</hi> Nor do I ſee any reaſon why the infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or deformities of ſome <hi>Clergie-men</hi> (and thoſe not many in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon) ſhould be more a ſtain and reproch to their calling, than other mens miſdemeanours are to their either civil or military pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions: in which though there ever will be ſome <hi>Cheats</hi> and <hi>Petti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foggers,</hi> others <hi>Quacks</hi> and <hi>Mountebanks,</hi> a third cowards and trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; yet theſe do not diminiſh the juſt honour and uſe of learned <hi>Lawyers,</hi> diſcreet <hi>Phyſicians,</hi> or gallant <hi>Souldiers,</hi> whoſe imployments are then liberall and ingenuous, when they are honeſt and uſefull to the Common-wealth.</p>
               <p>It were a madneſs to quarrel with all <hi>Candles,</hi> and put them out, becauſe ſome are ſmall, others want ſnuffing, a third ſort burn dim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and have (as we ſay) <hi>Thieves</hi> in them: the foggs and vapours riſing from the earth, and oft darkening the Suns light, are no dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution to its native luſtre, which is the greateſt viſible bleſſing in the world, as a <hi>good Biſhop and Miniſtry</hi> is in the Church: nor may the miſcarriages of ſome Biſhops and Presbyters in the <hi>Church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> be caſt as reproches, or made diſparagements to their holy or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, much leſs to the <hi>whole Church</hi>; eſpecially when we conſider that the defects and faults of ſome <hi>Clergie-men</hi> in <hi>England</hi> were mightily recompenſed, yea, and over-balanced by that learning, pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, induſtry and virtue, which was generally competent, and in many of them ſo eminent, that I believe the whole world did not exceed them, and few in any Church did match them; yea many, both <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops</hi> and other <hi>Miniſters,</hi> who ſeemed leſs plauſible or popular in their preaching, were yet not leſs ſound in their doctrine, potent in their writing, prudent in their governing, and exemplary in their godly lives, having that in height and depth, which others had in breadth and length.</p>
               <p>Who but perſons of egregious ignorance or profligate impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, without wit, modeſty, or conſcience, can or dare deny, what (bleſſed be God) is and ever will be moſt evident to all the world, that ever ſince the happy <hi>Reformation of the Church of England,</hi> there have been, and ſtill are (though their number ſeems now much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed by death, and other diſorders, without any due recruiting) ſuch <hi>Clergie-men</hi> (both <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Presbyters</hi>) who for all worth, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and humane, will be had (as they deſerve) in everlaſting and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable remembrance?</p>
               <p>After-ages, more remote from partiality, paſſion and faction, will better know how to value them by the want of them, than this Age hath done, which did ſometime enjoy them, and ſtill might, if ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving had ſo liberall experience of their other Chriſtian vertues and Miniſteriall abilities, in preaching, praying, writing and living, it had not ſought further to ſatisfie its curioſity, by trying the patience and perſeverance of many grave and good Miniſters; to which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the moſt heavy log-end of Chriſts Croſs is laid upon many of them, (not onely <hi>ſupplicia,</hi> but <hi>ludibria</hi>) ſilence, priſons and pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:97412:80"/>
which have befaln ſome of them, but undeſerved ſhame, with popular contempt; and this from their own countrey-men, and from many of their own <hi>converts</hi>: theſe now preſs upon their perſons and profeſſion too, threatning an utter extinction of their ancient order, authority and ſucceſſion in this Church and Nation, if their enemies might have their wills upon them; which (God be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) they have not yet obtained to the latitude of their malice, though it hath reached very far, God help us.</p>
               <p>I know that the preſent ſufferings of <hi>Biſhops</hi> and other <hi>Miniſters</hi> (as chief members of the <hi>Church of England</hi>) have been, and ſtill are, in many mens eyes, the greateſt ſigns and <hi>indications</hi> of their ſins; <hi>vulgar juſtice</hi> ever judging thoſe men <hi>criminous</hi> whom they ſee <hi>calamitous</hi>: like <hi>dogs</hi> in a countrey village, which are ready to flie upon any ſtrange one, not for any offence he gives them, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſee ſome currs have begun not onely to bark at him, but to bite and worry him.

This was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered to me by that ſage Dictator, whoſe anſwers have more of the Heathen oracles ambiguity, than of divine infallibility; when I ſillily urged thoſe fixed rules of juſtice, and unflexible bounds of equity and charity, of righteouſneſs and true holineſs, which I (ſimply) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived were impartially given in the <hi>written Word of God</hi> to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and ſpecially to all Chriſtians, to whom that Word is now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, and owned by them, as onely able to make the man of God perfect to every good word and work.

               <p>Yet becauſe experience teacheth us, that the ignorance, infirmity and incapacity of moſt people is ſuch, that they cannot eaſily find out of themſelves the <hi>Truths of God,</hi> which are the grounds of true Religion; yea, ſome are ſo lazy and indifferent, as to neglect all means which might help them; yea, and many are either ſo peeviſh or proud, as they are impatient not to be <hi>ſingular,</hi> or not to <hi>lead Diſciples</hi> after them in Religion (the higheſt ambition being that of <hi>Hereticks,</hi>

               <p>If theſe diſſolute fancies of <hi>Chriſtian liberty</hi> ſhould be followed or indulged to people by ſuch Magiſtrates and Miniſters as own that Religion, certainly no ſociety of men would be more unſociable, more ſordid, more ſhamefull, or more miſerable. Common people

               <p>If theſe <hi>grand Conſervators</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> who ought to be the choiſeſt perſons in the Church and Nation, both for ability, gravity and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, do (at their ſolemn and ſet meetings once or twice every year) allow the propounders reaſons and opinions, he may then publicate his judgement by preaching, diſputing, writing or printing:

But if they do not, he ſhall then keep his opinion to himſelf, in the bounds of private conference onely, for his better ſatisfaction; but in no way publicate it, to the ſcandall or perturbation of what is ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in Religion.

               <p>Private and modeſt diſſentings among Chriſtians ſafely may, and charitably ought to be born with all <hi>Chriſtian meekneſſe</hi> and <hi>wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi>: but certainly it would be the very peſt and <hi>gangrene</hi> of all true Religion, alſo the moth and canker of all civil as well as <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtick peace,</hi> to tolerate every mans ignorance, rudeneſs and prag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticalneſs, to innovate and act what they pleaſe in Religion.

               <p>Anſwerably we read in the Primitive Churches and times, this care and power was by the wiſdome of Chriſt fixed, and by all good Chriſtians owned, in the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Elders</hi>; to whom,<note place="margin">Acts 15.</note> in caſe of any diſpute or difference in <hi>Religion,</hi> addreſs was made, not onely to hear their counſel and judgement, but to ſubmit to their deciſions and decrees; which bound every man to preach no other doctrine, different from, much leſs contrary to, what that <hi>venerable conſiſtory</hi> both taught and ſummarily delivered to the Churches of Chriſt,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.3.</note> viz. <hi>wholſome formes, and ſhort ſummaries of ſound doctrine,</hi> as well as in their more <hi>diffuſed writings,</hi>

               <p>Agreeable to theſe holy precedents, every Chriſtian Church in after-ages had (within their ſeveral diſtributions, or dioceſes, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed by their Cities or Provinces) their <hi>Synods</hi> or <hi>Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Councils,</hi> for all thoſe emergencies or concernments of Religion which aroſe within their limits and combinations: proportionably they had more extenſive Conventions and <hi>generall Councils</hi> in caſes of grand concernment, for the comprimiſing of all differences in Religion, and conſervation of the Churches both purity and peace.

               <p>'Tis true, in the dimneſs of after-ages, when the decay of Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive zeal, love, ſanctity and ſincerity, had too much prevailed over theſe <hi>Weſtern Churches,</hi> the <hi>Biſhops</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> taking the advantage of the higher ground, whereon the fame of that City was raiſed, not onely for being the <hi>Metropolis of the Roman Empire,</hi> but for being a prime Church of <hi>Apoſtolicall plantation,</hi> and high renown for the Faith and martyrly conſtancy of its <hi>firſt Biſhops</hi>; theſe,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.8.</note> with no great difficulty, as with great art and policy, contrary to the judgement and practiſe of <hi>Antiquity</hi> for the firſt 600. years, ſought to fix the <hi>Standard of Religion</hi> in the <hi>Popes chair,</hi> and to make his breaſt the great <hi>Conſervator of Religion:</hi> certainly a very eaſie, compendious, and happy way to keep up the peace and honour of Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Churches, if the <hi>Biſhop of Rome</hi> could, in the <hi>noon-day-light</hi> of theſe, times either convince the world of his ſpeciall gift of <hi>Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility,</hi> or make good his claim of being <hi>ſole</hi> and <hi>ſupreme</hi> Judge of all controverſies in Religion, above any other Paſtors and Biſhops, yea and above a <hi>generall Council.</hi>

               <p>Who being not a little conſcious to themſelves, that they are groſly defective in all thoſe reall abilities of good learning, ſound knowledge, ſober judgement, orderly method, grave utterance, and weighty eloquence, which all wiſe and ſober Chriſtians expect ſhould appear in every true Miniſter of the Church of Chriſt, in ſuch a competent meaſure &amp; evident manner, as they may be able comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably to diſcern them, and uſefully to enjoy them; theſe crafty In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truders do firſt cry down all thoſe reall and viſible abilities, as meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly naturall, humane, carnall, as enemies to the Croſs, Grace, and Spirit of Chriſt: for (as the <hi>apes</hi> in the fable) theſe deceitfull wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers having no tails themſelves, they would fain perſwade all other creatures which have that ornament, to cut them off, as burdens and ſuperfluous. After this rude eſſay of craft and malice in vain attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted againſt the fruits of learned induſtry, wherein the Miniſters of the <hi>Church of England</hi> have, and ſtill do, ſo vaſtly exceed theſe <hi>Muſhrome Miniſters</hi> of the laſt and worſt editions, they cunningly flie to the pretentions of <hi>ſpeciall callings,</hi> extraordinary inſpirations, illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, and graces miniſteriall; which (they well know) are not eaſily to be diſcerned by any other but a mans ſelf, even there where they may poſſibly be real.

I am ſure, neither gifts nor graces miniſteriall are by wiſe and ſober Chriſtians to be much ſuppoſed or expected there, where men evidently ſilly and weak, mean and vain, ignorant and arrogant, dare yet to diſdain all that ancient order and uniform ſucceſſion of the <hi>Evangelicall Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry,</hi> which hath been viſible in all Churches (as in this of <hi>England</hi>) for 1500. years: and to ſalve their credit, or gain reputation as Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:97412:105"/>
they bring for the ſatisfaction of their own and other mens conſcience, in point of that office, duty, and power miniſteriall, which they challenge and undertake, no other <hi>ſignature</hi> and character of their commiſſion and inveſtiture into that office, ſave onely what themſelves pretend to be within them, of <hi>ſecret impulſes,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to mans judgement undiſcernable, are utterly inſignificant; nor ought they to bear any ſway in the Church of Chriſt, where the power miniſteriall was firſt declared by miraculous gifts and endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, alſo by evident ſigns &amp; wonders, ſufficient to confirm its firſt commiſſion, and to authorize its after-ſucceſſion, from thoſe onely with whom it was depoſited, to be tranſmitted by them and their ſucceſſors to the Churches of Chriſt in all ages, by ſuch gifts and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary endowments as might be firſt duly tried and approved in men, before they were ordained to be Miniſters in the Church of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But theſe Heteroclite Teachers, for the further corroboration of their dubious title and claim to the office of the Miniſtry, are content to accept of ſome appointment from that power which is meerly <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary,</hi> or civil and magiſtratick: which <hi>powers</hi> in Primitive Churches for 300. years were ſo far from making any Miniſter either Biſhop, or Presbyter, or Deacon in the Church of Chriſt, that they ſought by all means to perſecute and deſtroy the whole profeſſion of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity:<note place="margin">

                  </note> yea, when the Empire became Chriſtian, as in <hi>Conſtantine the Great</hi>'s time, neither <hi>He,</hi> nor any Chriſtian Emperour, Prince or Magiſtrate after him, was ever ſo impertinent as to imagine, that becauſe they could derive civil and military power to others, they had alſo power to make Chriſtian Miniſters, or to inveſt them with the Eccleſiaſticall power of holy orders; nor did they think they had any thing more to do with the Clergie by way of authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſave onely to take care for their due and comfortable diſcharge of that Miniſtery, to which they were by another principle and power ordained, according as the peace, honour and order of the Church required, which ſo conformed to the State and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weal, that all Miniſters were humbly ſubject to the Scepters of Princes, in the ſeverall places and ſtations Eccleſiaſticall to which they were applied. The Clergie owe to Princes the civil en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments of honour and revenue, given to them as the temporall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of their ſpirituall work: but they are not the ſources of their orders, nor can their broad ſeal confer that power of the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which onely makes a Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt; not by way of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces or gifts, ſo much as by way of miſſion and authority, flowing onely from the Spirit of Chriſt, as the chief Paſtor, Biſhop and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of his Church.</p>

               <p>The Spirit of Chriſt commends the Angel of the <hi>Church of Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> (where,<note place="margin">Rev. 2.2.</note> as <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and others tell us, S. <hi>John</hi> lived long, and left the moſt pregnant examples of Eccleſiaſticall order, <hi>Epiſcopall power,</hi> and Miniſteriall ſucceſſion) for <hi>trying</hi> thoſe that ſaid they were <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and were not; for finding, eſteeming, and declaring them as <hi>liars,</hi> no way liſtning and adhering to, or communicating with them, as being <hi>Falſaries</hi> and <hi>Impoſtors,</hi> enemies at once to the truth, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and peace of Chriſts Church. For 'tis ſeldome that a <hi>baſtardly generation</hi> of Preachers doth not bring forth ſome falſe and baſe doctrines: for it is obſervable in this, as in civil Hiſtories, that Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtards in nature, and ſo in office, are commonly moſt daring and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturous ſpirits. Certainly the late illegitimate Miniſters, or ſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Preachers of new and ſtrange originals in <hi>England,</hi> have in leſs than fifteen years brought more monſters of opinions and factions in Religion, than have aroſe in ſo many hundred years before in any one Church.</p>
               <p>I know ſome Chriſtians are prone to gratifie their <hi>curioſity</hi> (as thoſe do who ſometime go to ſee monſters) in making ſome triall and <hi>eſſay</hi> of theſe <hi>pretended Preachers,</hi> that once knowing their ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and inſolence, they may upon juſter grounds ever after ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor them.</p>
               <p>If this be tolerable for ſome perſons of able and ſober judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, yet it is no better than a ſnare and dangerous temptation for others that are weak and unſtable: nor may the venture be oft made by the more ſteddy Chriſtians, leſt they ſeem thereby to countenance and encourage ſo great a confuſion, innovation, uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſcandal in the Church of Chriſt; beſides the abetting of that high profanation of <hi>holy duties</hi> and myſteries, which ought not to be tranſacted, but in the name, power and authority of our God and Saviour. Certainly good Chriſtians ought not at any hand to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with ſuch uſurping intruders in any <hi>ſacramentall</hi> action; nor ought they to own any thing more of a <hi>Miniſter</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in them, than they would of a <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> in a <hi>Stage-player.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Doubtleſs, as no good Chriſtian, ſo leaſt of all thoſe that profeſs to be <hi>Miniſters of Chriſt,</hi> ought to live as ſons of <hi>Belial,</hi> diſorderly, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractory, unruly, after the arbitrary, rude and preſumptuous dictates of their own wills. The <hi>ſpirit of true Ministers and Prophets will be ſubject,</hi> as it ought, to that rule, order and cuſtome,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14 32.</note> which in all ages hath been the canon, meaſure and commiſſion of all Evangelical Miniſters and Paſtors of Chriſts Church. As naturall and <hi>morall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments</hi> are no plea to inveſt any man into any office, <hi>military</hi> or <hi>ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi>; much leſs into any power and <hi>authority Eccleſiaſtical.</hi> The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſes of new and extraordinary calls, of <hi>miſsions</hi> immediate from God, are not in any reaſon expectable, nor in Chriſtian Religion credible, where the ordinary power and commiſſion was continued,

and might duly be had, as it was, and yet is in the <hi>Church of England: Ravens</hi> muſt not be hoped for to feed us, where Providence gives us opportunity to get our bread by <hi>honeſt induſtry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where then there are ſo many <hi>intruders</hi> and deceivers gone out, as <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the Goſpel, it is a matter of conſcience as well as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary prudence in all good Chriſtians, to be cautious and inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, whom they allow and follow as <hi>Miniſters</hi>; to be firſt ſatisfied in that queſtion which the Jews rationally asked of <hi>Chriſt, By what power or authority doſt thou theſe things?</hi>

               </p>
               <p>No diſcreet perſon in civil affairs will obey any <hi>warrant or order,</hi> which hath no other authority than a private and <hi>pragmatick activi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:</hi> and can it be piety or prudence in Chriſtians, to be deluded by any pretenders in the great <hi>concernments</hi> of their ſouls; to have no more of <hi>Sacraments,</hi> or any other holy duties, than the meer ſenſible ſhell and husk of them? for the ſpiritual life and power of them is no where to be had but from ſuch <hi>diſpenſers</hi> of them, as have the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and power,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat. 7.29.</hi> He taught them as one having au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. <hi>1 Cor. 4.19.</hi> Not the speech, but the power.</note> the miſſion and commiſſion of Chriſt rightly deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to them: which was evident firſt in Chriſt, after in his holy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and their lawfull ſucceſſors.</p>
               <p>Certainly the cheat and falſity of ſuch <hi>mock-Miniſters</hi> and <hi>Pſeudo-paſtors,</hi> is of far greater danger and detriment than thoſe of ſpurious and <hi>ſuppoſititious</hi> children, or of <hi>embaſed coin,</hi> and counterfeit money. Some people have been ſo wicked, as to change their own children, &amp; ſteal others from their parents; but it was never heard that children of any diſcretion were ſo fooliſh and unnaturall, as to abdicate their <hi>true Fathers</hi> and <hi>genuine mothers,</hi> that they might adopt falſe parents, and ſuperinduce upon themſelves the Empire of <hi>baſtardly progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</hi> The miſchief &amp; abuſe is not leſs in Churches than in Common-weales, in Chriſtian Congregations than in families. Due reſpect of paternall care and filiall love, ſuch as ought to be between Paſtor and People, can never be mutually expected, where the relation is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuppoſititious, or preſumptuous, or meerly imaginary, or at beſt but arbitrary, which is inconſiſtent with humane, much more with divine Authority; the meaſure of which is not the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of man, but the will of God, whoſe will is aſſerted by his power.</p>
               <p>For my part, I firmly conclude, that as no true Chriſtians may admit of any <hi>Goſpel,</hi> or <hi>Sacraments,</hi> or holy Inſtitutions, other than ſuch as have been already <hi>once delivered</hi> to the Catholick Church,<note place="margin">

That all Biſhops, or preſidentiall Fathers and Over-ſeers among the Clergie, ſuch as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and their immediate Succeſſors firſt were, are <hi>Antichriſtian</hi>; truly ſo are <hi>Fathers</hi> in families, Magiſtrates in ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and Chieftains in armies. 2. That the ordaining of <hi>Presbyters</hi> by <hi>Biſhops</hi> is meerly <hi>Popiſh</hi>; ſo is the celebrating of Baptiſme, or the Lords Supper, or the Lords day. 3. That Chriſts Miniſtry ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to one order of men, is a <hi>monopoly,</hi> or a taking too much upon mens ſelves, when others of the congregation may be as holy and able; ſo is all order, office and authority, civil and military, a meer monopoly, when others may be as able and wiſe as the beſt Magiſtrates and Commanders. 4. That all humane Learning is not onely ſuperfluous, but pernicious in the Miniſters of the Goſpel; ſo is all skill, induſtry and ability in all other workmen. 5. That Miniſters maintenance by <hi>Tithes, Glebe-lands,</hi> and other <hi>oblations,</hi> is <hi>Jewiſh</hi>; ſo is all juſtice and gratitude in paying <hi>labourers</hi> their wages. 6. That the diſtinction of <hi>Clergie</hi> and <hi>Laity</hi> is arrogant and ſuperci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious; ſo are the titles of <hi>Maſter</hi> and <hi>Scholar,</hi> Teacher and Diſciple, <hi>Prieſt</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> Miniſter and miniſtred. 7. That it was proud and inſolent for any Clergie-men to be inveſted with honour, to be ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and reſpected as <hi>Lords.</hi> Truly, if it be no diſhonour to any tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Lord to become a Miniſter or Chriſts glorious Goſpel, nor doth he thereby loſe his civil <hi>Lordſhip</hi> and dignity; no more is it miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming learned, grave and venerable Miniſters of the Goſpel, the chief Fathers and governours of the Church, to be adorned with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and to enjoy, as the favours of Chriſtian Princes and States, both the <hi>Titles</hi> and Revenues of their temporall <hi>Baronies</hi> and Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, which they might (for ought I could ever ſee) as well deſerve and uſe as any other <hi>Lords,</hi> who had their Lordſhips by birth, by purchaſe, or by favour: nor did Honour leſs become Eccleſiaſtick Rulers, than it doth thoſe <hi>military Commanders,</hi> who, I ſee, can endure themſelves to be called &amp; treated as <hi>Lords.</hi> I confeſs (under favour) I do not underſtand how Church-government ſhould be leſs capable of degrees and diſtinction in Governours, than thoſe which are civil or military, ſince order and ſubordination muſt be in them all: nor do I more underſtand how ſuch chief <hi>Governours of the Church-mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant,</hi> as Biſhops were, and ought to be, might not as well both merit and manage ſuch honours and eſtates, as any men, who by far leſs abilities or pains do get to be Major-generals, or Colonels and chief Commanders in an Army over poor Souldiers.

               <p>It is an obſervation never failing, That the <hi>ſanctity</hi> of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Martyrs, the honour and prevalency of that Religion which recommends the <hi>crucified Lord Jeſus,</hi> as a Saviour and preſerver, not a deſtroyer of mankind, theſe are beſt preſerved in any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or ſociety of men, there, where <hi>leaſt liberty</hi> or <hi>licenſe</hi> is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to private ſpirits publickly to innovate or alter, diſpute or deny, contemn or ſubvert, thoſe Catholick Truths and Doctrines, or thoſe comely conſtitutions and cuſtomes, which are once well &amp; wiſely ſetled by publick counſel and authority, which carried due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard

               <p>Nor do they think it worth conſidering, how much they <hi>deviate</hi> from all <hi>Antiquity</hi>; how much they deſert, yea &amp; reproch the wiſdom of this <hi>Church</hi> and all <hi>eſtates in this Nation,</hi> ever ſince it was either <hi>Chriſtian</hi> or <hi>Reformed</hi>; how much they go beyond the duty they owed to the civil peace of this Nation, as alſo that modeſty, humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, ingenuity, reverence and ſubjection, which by the <hi>lawes of God and man,</hi> by all ſanctions, civil and Eccleſiaſticall, they owed to the

Governours and guides, Paſtors and Preachers, the peace and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of this <hi>Church of England</hi>; beſides that prudence and policy which they ought to maintain, in order to the honour and reſpect, which is indeed due to their calling and authority, when it is truly miniſteriall and authentick.</p>
               <p>What ſober and impartial man doth not ſee, how the deſpites, arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies and inſolencies, firſt expreſſed in tumultuary heats and furies, againſt all Biſhops whatſoever (though never ſo learned, grave, god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and induſtrious men, fit to govern, and apt to teach the Church of Chriſt,) are ſtill maintained and repeated daily; yea raked up and increaſed by the <hi>popular oratory</hi> of ſome novel Miniſters, ſo far as to raiſe eternall prejudices and antipathies, even againſt all thoſe <hi>Presbyters</hi> which were, or are, of <hi>Epiſcopall ordination</hi>? And the better to juſtifie theſe Novelties and Schiſms in the <hi>Church of England,</hi> (which ſome were ſo eager and eaſie to begin, ſo loth and unwilling to retract) they ſtill entertain their nauſeous, credulous and itching Diſciples, with all thoſe odious, ſtale and envious <hi>Crambes,</hi> which are moſt welcome to vulgar ears and ſacrilegious aims: as how unfit it was for the Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt, who was the great pattern of piety and poverty, to have great revenues, ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Palaces,</hi> and noble <hi>Lordſhips,</hi> which more godly men do want; for Preachers to have any titles of honour and reſpect, as <hi>Lords,</hi> to have any part of <hi>civil power,</hi> or indeed of <hi>Eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All which honeſt employments and enjoyments, I conceive, (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der favour) the excellent Biſhops, and other deſerving Clergie-men in <hi>England,</hi> were as worthy to enjoy, and as able to uſe, with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, conſcience and charity, as any of thoſe men, either military or civil, who were moſt zealous to deprive, to debaſe, and to deſtroy the Hierarchy, or juſt honour of the Eccleſiaſtick ſtate in <hi>England.</hi> Nor do I think it was any way diſpleaſing to God, or in the leaſt kind unbecoming the name of Chriſt, for Biſhops and other Miniſters of his Church to have ſuch ample eſtates and honourable preferments for their <hi>double honour,</hi> in ſo plentifull a land as <hi>England</hi> was: this I am ſure, it was far leſs beſeeming any good Chriſtian to repine at them, and unjuſtly to deprive them of them.</p>
               <p>If this envious vein of popular oratory grow at length fulſome, vile and ridiculous (as it is now to all ſober and judicious auditors;) then the <hi>Anti-epiſcopall</hi> parties of <hi>Miniſters</hi> devoutly rip up, and ſadly repeat whatever they have heard, or others invented, of any <hi>Biſhops faults,</hi> or the Epiſcopall Clergies paſt infirmities: whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they can they rake up, though long ago buried as it ought to be, in the charitable forgetfulneſs of all good men, who either conſider their own frailties, or remember how many holy <hi>Biſhops</hi> were Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs and Confeſſors in all ages of perſecution; how learned, how diligent, how commendable, how admirable, how uſeful they were to this Church, for their preaching, writing and living, in times of perſecution as well as peace, even here in <hi>England.</hi> All good Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and other Clergie (as I have formerly expreſſed) confeſs
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:97412:132"/>
themſelves, as men, to be ſubject to infirmities and temptations; the beſt Biſhops and Miniſters leaſt deny this truth, being every day moſt vigilant to reſiſt the one, and amend the other. Theſe allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions then (like the <hi>Devils quoting of Scripture</hi>) though they may have ſome ſquint-ey'd truth in them, yet they are ſpitefully, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and moſt impertinently alledged againſt all Biſhops, eſpecially by thoſe fierce Presbyterians, or other implacable Preachers, who have now liberally taught the <hi>Engliſh world,</hi> that however the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, pomp and honours of Presbyterian or Independent, or other Preachers, are (much againſt their wills) far leſs than thoſe which God and man, reaſon and Religion, order and polity, devotion and gratitude, Law and Goſpel, allowed to Biſhops and Presbyters heretofore (that the eminency of their office and place in the Church might have ſomething of <hi>honourable ſplendour</hi> and <hi>hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table magnificence,</hi> proportionable to its <hi>venerable authority</hi> and <hi>great antiquity</hi>;) yet men are not ſo blinded by that <hi>popular</hi> duſt, ſtirred up againſt the faults and <hi>names of Biſhops,</hi> as not to ſee that the pride, covetouſneſs and imperiouſneſs of the moſt furious and factious <hi>Anti-epiſcopall Miniſters,</hi> come not one jot behind any of thoſe Biſhops, whom they look upon and repreſent with the moſt malignant aſpect. O how magiſteriall are many new maſters in their opinions! how authoritative in their deciſions! how ſupercilious in their converſations! how ſevere in their cenſures! how inexo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in their paſſions! how implacable in their wrath! how infle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xible in their factions! how irrevocable in their tranſports, though never ſo raſh, heady, plebeian and unſucceſsfull! by which they (at once) forſook their <hi>duties to others,</hi> and their <hi>own mercies.</hi> And this many of them did to pleaſe others or themſelves, contrary to their former judgements, their ſworn and <hi>avowed ſubjection</hi> to Biſhops for many years, when they paid that reſpect to thoſe Fathers and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of this Church, which the laws of God and man required, long before either <hi>Presbytery</hi> was hatched, or <hi>Independency</hi> gendered in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſharp <hi>ſeverities</hi> and early <hi>rigours</hi> of both which parties and <hi>their Conſectaries,</hi> grew quickly both remarkable and intolerable to ſober Chriſtians: for as they were bred and born (like <hi>Pallas</hi>) arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, full of anger, revenge and ambitious fierceneſs; ſo they have acted, even in their <hi>infancy</hi> and <hi>minority,</hi> far beyond what regular, ſober, and true <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> ever did in its greateſt age and procerity here in <hi>England</hi>; yea its greateſt paſſion and tranſports did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the aims of theſe new maſters, both Eccleſiaſtical &amp; civil, which was either to rule all, or to ruine all. <hi>Biſhops</hi> commonly juſtified their reall or ſeeming ſeverities by thoſe <hi>lawes,</hi> either civil or Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall, which were in force againſt all ſuch as did not conform to them. Hence were occaſioned (much, I am confident, to the grief, and againſt the deſire of the moſt grave and godly Biſhops) ſometimes thoſe ſo oft declaimed againſt, and aggravated perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſome unconformable, yet otherwayes <hi>godly Miniſters,</hi> by ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencings,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:97412:132"/>
ſuſpenſions, deprivations, &amp;c. which ſometimes were but juſt and neceſſary exerciſes of Diſcipline (as I conceive) if men will maintain any order and government in any Church or State; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, it may be, ſome Biſhops preſſed too much upon the ſtrictneſs and rigour of law, aggravated by their private paſſions, beyond what might with charity and moderation ſafely have been indulged to ſome able and peaceable Miniſters, though in ſome things diſſenters, yet, as to the main, good and uſefull to the Church.</p>
               <p>Yet all theſe old Almanacks, theſe ſtale and poſthumous calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Epiſcopall ſeverities,</hi> did not upon true account, no not in one hundred years, equal the number and meaſure of thoſe preſſures and miſeries, which have been acted or deſigned in one <hi>fifteen years,</hi> by ſuch as now profeſs <hi>Presbyterian</hi> and <hi>Independent</hi> principles, againſt all <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and all thoſe <hi>Miniſters</hi> which are of the Epiſcopal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion. I think it may, without any ſtroke of <hi>Rhetorick</hi> or <hi>Hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bole,</hi> be ſaid with ſober truth, that the little finger of <hi>Presbytery</hi> and <hi>Independency,</hi> with the warts and wens of other factions growing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, hath been heavier upon the Epiſcopal, which was the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly legal <hi>Clergie of England</hi> of late years, than the loins of any ſober and godly Biſhops ever were for any one <hi>century,</hi> yea, and equal to the <hi>burdens</hi> of the moſt paſſionate and immoderate Biſhops whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever in any age, who commonly were moſt imperious when the Church had moſt peace and civil proſperity; but the <hi>Presbyterian thunder</hi> and <hi>Independent lightning,</hi> urged moſt upon all <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and all <hi>Epiſcopall Miniſters,</hi> then when they were moſt ſcared, pillaged and harraſed by a civil war, when moſt toſſed by thoſe ſad ſtorms, and almoſt overwhelmed by the impreſſions of thoſe ſad diſſentions. Then, then was it that <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>other Epiſcopall Miniſters,</hi> (whoſe conſciences were guided in their judgements by the wiſdome of this Church and Nation, together with all other Chriſtian Churches in all ages) having loſt their <hi>clokes</hi> in the wars, muſt be deprived of their <hi>coats</hi> alſo; chiefly for their innocent opinion, and honeſt adherency to <hi>Catholick Epiſcopacy:</hi> then was it, that where <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> had at any time, and that by ſpecial command from their Governours, ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced or <hi>ſequestred</hi> refractory or turbulent Miniſters, by tens or hundreds, poſſibly <hi>Presbytery</hi> and <hi>Independency</hi> inflicted either thoſe mulcts, or terrours at leaſt, upon <hi>thouſands of Miniſters</hi> diſſenting from them, not as to the Religion eſtabliſhed, or Laws in force in <hi>England,</hi> but meerly as to their private opinions and principles about Church-government. Hence ſo many learned, pious and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Preachers, ſince the civil <hi>digladiations</hi> ceaſed, had been condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to chains of everlaſting darkneſs, to remedileſs diſtreſſes, both they and their families, if there had not been ſome more generous mercy and connivence ſhewed, than thoſe mens ſpirits intended, or can well bear. Through which miſeries and terrours, many Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters gray hairs have been brought down with ſorrow to their graves.</p>
               <p>After all which dreadful ſeverities, either intended or executed,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:97412:133"/>
againſt the <hi>Epiſcopall Clergie,</hi> yet, as far as I can ſee, the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any ſort of <hi>Miniſters</hi> now in <hi>England</hi> is not any whit better, as to the generality, nor comparable to what the Clergie enjoyed in former times, who in my judgement might well have born the <hi>yoke of Epiſcopacy,</hi> with as little diſparagement, and with as much eaſe and honour, every way, as they have for ſome years done the examination and inſpection, the rebukes and frowns, the terrours and juriſdictions of <hi>Major Generals,</hi> or <hi>Countrey Committees,</hi> not onely in ſecular and military, but even in religious reſpects: among which few, I believe, were to be found equal, or exceeding ſuch Biſhops and other grave Divines as <hi>England</hi> afforded, both able Preachers and excellent Governours; much more fitted in all reſpects (except their ſwords) to be the <hi>ſuperintendents of Miniſters,</hi> being of the ſame education, office and calling, than moſt of thoſe men can be, who are (generally) ſo much (<hi>Heteroclites</hi>) different from learned men, both in their breeding, learning, ſtudies and courſe of living, that even from hence they have ſometimes <hi>ſecret Antipathies</hi> even againſt all Miniſters or Clergy-men, as perſons of another geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, of more refined minds, and, if men were impartially weighed, of greater worth and merits.</p>
               <p>As then I cannot find that <hi>Miniſters</hi> of any new name, form, title and extractions whatſoever, have much mended their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by that great alteration they have made or ſought in this Church and State; ſo, I am ſure, their mutual enmities and diviſions do very much heighten their common <hi>afflictions,</hi> and add exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to that general darkneſs and diminution, in all reſpects, civil and ſacred, which is come or coming upon them, as upon wicked men, in the ſtrict account of Gods juſtice; or as weak men, in the vulgar proceſs of mans ſeverity.</p>
               <p>Indeed the worſt of <hi>Ministers</hi> miſeries they generally owe to themſelves, who in piety and prudence, above all men, ſhould by uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted counſels and cares avoid them; becauſe it is ſport to the moſt and worſt of men, to ſee thoſe men <hi>together by the ears,</hi> hating, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing, biting and devouring one another, who are eſteemed the ſevere cenſurers of other mens ſins and follies, ſharp curbs to the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh, petulant and <hi>licentious humours</hi> of people. <hi>Miniſters scufflings</hi> and conteſts with one another, is beyond any <hi>Cock-fighting</hi> or <hi>Bear-baiting</hi> to the <hi>vulgar</hi> envy, malice, profaneneſſe and petu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancy.</p>

and every day proclaimed by the <hi>loud Herauld of Experience,</hi> which <hi>themſelves</hi> declaime againſt and deplore, as well as other men: Yet many Miniſters (in other reſpects not to be deſpiſed, or much blamed) do ſtill, as to the point of <hi>Church-order, diſcipline, govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> and <hi>polity,</hi> (which is the outward centre of unity, and viſible band of peace) paſſionately deſire and ſolicitouſly endeavour, that thoſe <hi>wild oats</hi> and tares, which ſome men have of late years ſown, watered and cheriſhed (while the Nation and Church were not aware, as being engaged in war and blood, during whoſe heats great wounds of Religion are little felt) might for ever grow up, ſpread and ſhed abroad (like <hi>thiſtle-down</hi>) yea and ſucceed to <hi>after-generations in this nation</hi>; that ſo <hi>England</hi> might be more famous for variety of parties and opinions in Religion, than either <hi>Poland</hi> is or <hi>Amſterdam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How few nominal or real <hi>Miniſters,</hi> that have been either Authors, or great ſticklers and abettors, not of any modeſt, juſt and ſober Reformations, but of needleſs, endleſs innovations, ſchiſms, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formities and defections in the <hi>Church of England,</hi> can yet find in their hearts meekly to retreat by any humble, ingenuous and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py wayes of Chriſtian meekneſs and wiſdom, to a ſweet accord, from their firſt <hi>heady extravagances</hi> and <hi>unhappy tranſports</hi>? in which the heat and paſſion of mens ſpirits (as is uſual in all quarrels) made, even at firſt, the differences, jealouſies and offences far greater than the real <hi>injury</hi> or inconvenience indeed was: which is moſt clearly evident now, not onely by our comparing the former happy eſtate of this Church, and of the Reformed Religion here, beſides thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts which the generality of all good Miniſters and ſober Chriſtians in former times enjoyed in <hi>England</hi> under Epiſcopacy; but fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by our ſerious conſidering thoſe fair offers, thoſe great mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, thoſe ſelf-denials and Chriſtian condeſcentions, with which all worthy and wiſe Biſhops, with all Epiſcopal Miniſters, were, and are, ready to gratifie the peace of this <hi>Church,</hi> and the deſires of all good <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> even of thoſe who have been moſt their enemies and deſtroyers; whom they forgive the more readily, becauſe they believe moſt of them, as the crucifiers of Chriſt, did it <hi>ignorantly</hi>; ignorant of the laws of this Nation, and of the good conſtitutions of this Church, ignorant of the cuſtomes, practiſe and judgement of all ancient <hi>Catholick Churches,</hi> ignorant of that equity and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which they owed to others, ignorant of that honeſt policy and diſcretion which they owed to themſelves and their order, laſtly, ignorant of that pious, grateful and prudent regard they ſhould have had of the honour, peace and proſperity of this Church, both at preſent and in after-ages.</p>
               <p>But however the exorbitancies of ſome ignorant men at firſt might be ſo far venial, as they were led on by the pious and ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous pretences of others, rather than their own principles; yet they are leſs excuſable (now) ſince the <hi>ſad events</hi> have ſo fully confuted all thoſe prejudices and pretenſions; ſince popular looſeneſs, avarice

and madneſs, hath, as a rude broom, ſwept away all the fine-ſpun and ſpeciouſly ſpread <hi>cobwebs of Reformation,</hi> either as to the ſtate of this Church, or the Reformed Religion profeſſed here in <hi>England,</hi> or as to the promiſed amendment of the Miniſterial order and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, either for ability, duty, authority, or maintenance.

               </p>
               <p>For as no City, ſo no Church can proſper,<note place="margin">Mar. 3.24.</note> that is divided againſt it ſelf: neither grace nor peace can advance, where <hi>Preachers</hi> of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion are <hi>mutual perſecutors</hi>; where, while Miniſters teach people to believe, to love and to live <hi>Chriſt crucified,</hi> they are daily <hi>cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying</hi> one another. It is a deplorable and deſperate ſtate of any <hi>Church,</hi> where (as in <hi>Babels</hi> building) the builders tongues, heads, hands and hearts are divided, yea the very builders are ſelf-deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, mutually ruining themſelves under pretence of zeal to build, or repaire the Church of Chriſt: what one rears with the <hi>right</hi> hand, another pulls down with the <hi>left</hi>; when they frequently leave their trowels, and fall to their pick-axes and ponyards; when they fling lime and ſand in one anothers eyes; when they build, or dawb rather, with untempered mortar; when every one is ambitious to be a <hi>Maſter-builder,</hi> a new modeller of Religion, of Churches, of Miniſters and of Miniſtry, contrary to the wiſdome and piety of ſuch a Church and Nation as <hi>England</hi> was.</p>
               <p>Leaving poor people (mean while) infinitely <hi>amazed,</hi> jealous, unſatisfied, perplexed, as to Religion. Some are ſadly grieved, others are quite confounded: many are zealous for the <hi>neweſt faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> others are for the good old way, a third ſort is glad of the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to caſt off all <hi>Religion,</hi> while they ſee thoſe Miniſters cut the Catholick cords of charity and unity in ſunder, in order to bind Chriſtians up to new parties and factions, or to private intereſts and opinions, which, like <hi>Sampſons</hi> withs, will not ſerve to bind the luſts or conſciences of men to their good behaviour.</p>
               <p>Theſe, theſe are the ſad effects which follow thoſe <hi>deformities</hi> of <hi>Preachers</hi> turning <hi>Pioneers,</hi> of Miniſters being underminers and demoliſhers of one another, and their Mother-Church; when thoſe that ſhould be <hi>Gods Ambaſſadours</hi> (forgetting the majeſty of their miſſion, and ſanctity of their errand) fall to railing and reproching, calumniating and declaiming againſt one another (like ſo many eager Bariſters and mercenary <hi>Lawyers,</hi> who are reſolved (being once fee'd) to defend their cauſe and their client, whatever the merits of them be, becauſe they have once undertaken them) without any regard to that juſtice, honour, wiſdome, gravity, charity, meekneſs, harmony, joynt counſel and ingenuous correſpondency, which ought to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in all fraternities and honeſt callings or myſteries: but chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               </p>
               <p>At preſent it ſufficeth to have ſhewed (as an evil branch of abuſed <hi>Liberty</hi> in Religion) this to be none of the leaſt <hi>cauſes or occaſions</hi> of the <hi>Church of Englands diſtempers, decayes</hi> and <hi>miſeries,</hi> that <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> are (after Mundane and machiavellian methods) ſo <hi>ſharply di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided</hi> from, and eagerly oppoſite againſt one another; ſo hardly perſwaded by any retreats and principles of piety, charity, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which honeſt policy, publick neceſſity, ſelf-preſervation, or care of future ſucceſſion invite them to; which may make for an happy cloſe and Chriſtian accommodation.</p>

               <p>Their own and all mens eyes that are open and clear, may eaſily ſee the ſad proſpects of <hi>Miniſters dejections,</hi> diminutions, debaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, diſtreſſes in all thoſe points: all of them are under the ſcorn of ſome <hi>oppoſite party</hi> or other; moſt of them live in a <hi>low and mean eſtate</hi>; many of them (to my knowledge) contend with extreme <hi>difficulties,</hi> and all manner of <hi>neceſsities</hi>; not a few of them, which I have been oft an eye-witneſs of, have been, and are reduced to a <hi>morſel of bread,</hi> and are driven even to beg alms for the ſupport of themſelves and their diſtreſſed families. How many of their cryes have I heard? how many of their tears have I ſeen? with what pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor and dejection, with what ſquallor and horrour, with what aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment and deſpair, do many of them wander from one village, city, and countrey to another for relief, untill being weary and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, ſunk and oppreſſed by their daily diſtreſſes and <hi>remedileſſe tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedies,</hi> they <hi>go to their graves with ſorrow,</hi> to the ſhame and ſin (I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve) of the Age in which they have thus lived and died <hi>Miniſters of the Goſpel,</hi> and very worthy ones too, if it be any merit to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly deſerved well of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> by their godly prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and living: over whoſe ſad ruines I know the enemies of this Church and the <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> both at home and abroad, do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely triumph and ſeriouſly rejoyce.</p>

made by me: No; I ſolemnly proteſt to you (<hi>my honoured Countrymen</hi>) the World affords not greater, more <hi>numerous,</hi> or more <hi>calamitous objects</hi> of Chriſtian pity and humane charity, than are many Miniſters at preſent in <hi>England,</hi> if you conſider their calling, their abilities, their education, and their ſad condition. Many of them are already <hi>implunged</hi> into the horrible pit of darkneſſe; others are upon the very brink and precipice of extreme poverty, meanneſſe and contempt, through the trialls or diſpleaſures of God, executed by the reſtleſſe malice and immoderate revenge of ſome men, againſt this Church, its Miniſtry, and the <hi>Reformed Religion</hi>; whoſe ſpite and paſſion have much over-born (of late years, as by a new, unwonted and <hi>ponderous bias</hi>) the ancient noble <hi>genius</hi> and <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous piety of this Nation</hi>; which was by no people under Heaven heretofore exceeded in its <hi>honourable munificence,</hi> yea magnificence, toward their God and Saviour, toward learned and <hi>religious men,</hi> eſpecially thoſe who had the honour to be their <hi>Teachers, Governours</hi> and <hi>Guides</hi> to heaven. No men had more priviledges and immunities; no men had more <hi>tranquillity</hi> and leiſure to be good; none had more means and encouragements to be good, and to doe good, to live <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily, hoſpitably, honourably</hi>; no men had abilities, opportunities, and hearts to doe more works of piety and charity both to rich and poor, great and ſmall, both tranſient and permanent, occaſionall and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numentall, than the Clergie of <hi>England:</hi> Witneſſe the ſeverall goodly Foundations, and liberall Endowments, which the Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks of <hi>England</hi> have either themſelves erected, or perſwaded o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to Found and Endow, to Gods glory, to the good of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and the honour of the Nation.</p>
               <p>But now (alas!) as the Eſtates of moſt Miniſters are ſo ſmall, that they hardly reach to their own neceſſities; ſo their <hi>influence</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on other mens eſtates and minds is almoſt as little. They are <hi>deſpiſed</hi> by many, valued by few, ſcarce loved by any, and honoured almoſt by none: they are all reduced to ſuch a timorous, ſneaking, ſervile, arbitrary, dependant, and plebeian proportion. Nothing grand, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous, magnificent, honourable or venerable, is upon any of them, eſpecially as to vulgar eyes and cenſure: who are never too liberall of their courteſie, civility, and reſpect to Miniſters; much leſſe when they find them at a low ebbe, as to the eſteem of their betters, the rich, the noble, and the mighty. For with common people, Learning, Wiſdome, and all intellectuall excellencies, generally ſignifie little or nothing, if they ſee nothing of power, authority, plenty, ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, or eminency in men, by which they either hope to be bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited, or feare to be <hi>puniſhed.</hi> Certainly that part of the Clergie of <hi>England</hi> were extreme out, as to all Politicks, who fancied that <hi>common people,</hi> yea, or the <hi>better ſort of mankind,</hi> were ſo good-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd, as to value them moſt for Miniſters, when they enjoyed leaſt as men. <hi>Angelick vertues</hi> doe not weigh ſo much in the worlds ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, as houſes, lands, revenues, preferments, and honours doe. A <hi>golden calfe</hi> eaſily tempts people to worſhip it, while <hi>deſolate</hi> and

               <p>The reall <hi>impoveriſhings,</hi> ſufferings and abaſings of many Miniſters, have been very great, in all <hi>bitter extremities</hi>; nor are the fears, ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors or dejections of thoſe, few or ſmall, who have ſcaped beſt, who are ſtill permitted, either by their gentler neighbours, or the leſſe ſevere Lay-Biſhops of later inſpection, to earn their <hi>bread with the ſweat of their brows.</hi> For even of theſe Miniſters, many of them dare ſcarce <hi>demand</hi> their wages, when they have dearly deſerved it; nor can they tell how with ſafety and peace to get it, when they have hardly earned it: ſo terrified and over-awed, ſo threatned and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched are they, ſome by peeviſh pariſhioners, others by <hi>ſeparating ſtraglers,</hi> and a third ſort (which is a very <hi>Epidemicall</hi> miſchief) by ſharking and ſhuffling, dilatory and grumbling <hi>pay-maſters</hi>; who think they deal very bountifully with their Miniſters, if they pay them at the <hi>years</hi> end, with ſome difficulty, and many importunities (which looks very like pure begging) after the rate of <hi>two ſhillings</hi> in the pound for their <hi>Tythes,</hi> when they are <hi>bonâ fide</hi> worth foure, five, or ſix ſhillings. Few, yea very few, as I ſaid, make it any point of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in Law, Religion, or Gratitude, to doe <hi>juſtice</hi> to their <hi>Miniſters,</hi> ſo as their rights are aſſigned them by Mans laws. Few ſcruple to rob, deny, ſhark, detain, and immodeſtly to delay the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their dues, even according to their own agreements. If the poore Miniſter complains, though never ſo ſoftly and whiſperingly, if Neceſſities ſo pinch him, that he muſt either cry aloud, or ſtarve with his wife and children, if he have ſo much ſpirit and courage, as he dares roundly to demand, or to urge the Law in his behalf; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently he is ſcared with the <hi>menaces</hi> of ſome proling <hi>Sequeſtrator,</hi> or ſome ſurly <hi>Aproniere,</hi> who being the fag-end or dregs of a <hi>Countrey-Committee,</hi> and ſowred either with <hi>Anabaptiſticall</hi> leven, or other factious principles, thinks he does <hi>God good ſervice</hi> to threaten, to terrifie, to torment, to rout, to undoe ſuch a quarrelſome <hi>Miniſter,</hi> who dares thus far to own himſelf, his calling, his condition, and his rights by Law; eſpecially if the Miniſter be known to be of the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopall judgment,</hi> a lover and honourer of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and have a Living worth the loſing. O what arts and policy, what wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and ſhifts, what complyings and cringings muſt this poore per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed Miniſter uſe, to fence himſelf againſt the <hi>crafty agitations</hi> of his <hi>ſpitefull</hi> neighbours, and thoſe pragmatick pieces, who in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry corner doe hover over the heads of Miniſters, as <hi>Kites</hi> doe over <hi>Pigeons</hi>! How many times have Miniſters been affronted publiquely,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:97412:138"/>
even in their Churches, amidſt Divine Offices; and had been much more, even to the outraging of their perſons, if either the piety or the policy of thoſe in power had not intervened, and in time repreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed this <hi>intolerable inſolency,</hi> which was never heard of, never indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, never connived at in any Nation under heaven, that owned any publique veneration, ſervice, or Religion to their God? If ſome ſtop and reſtraint had not for ſhame been given to theſe profane enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, certainly by this time no true or worthy <hi>Miniſter</hi> ſhould have opened his mouth in publique, but he ſhould have been <hi>ſmitten</hi> on the <hi>mouth</hi> (as <hi>Ananias</hi> commanded them to uſe St.<note place="margin">Acts 23<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2</note>

               <p>For beſides the private <hi>ſcorns</hi> and <hi>conteſts,</hi> no leſſe than publique <hi>affronts,</hi> which Miniſters have perſonally ſuſtained, their enemies have proceeded many times to give even publick <hi>alarms</hi> to all the <hi>tribe</hi> &amp; <hi>function,</hi> by rude <hi>Pamphlets,</hi> bitter libellings, and inſolent <hi>Petitions,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuning an utter <hi>extirpation</hi> of the Calling, Ordination, and Succeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">Eſth. 3.</note> (ſuch as <hi>Haman</hi> deſigned againſt the whole Nation of the Jews) together with a total alienation or confiſcation of all the ſetled main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of Miniſters by Glebes and Tithes.

               <p>But the frequent tamperings and eſſays which ſome men ſtill make in theſe kinds, (for what dare not the meaneſt wretches meditate and adventure againſt the beſt, yea all the ſober Miniſters of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland?</hi>) theſe (as the clouds did <hi>Deucalion</hi> after the Flood) do ſtill ſo terrifie the minds of the better ſort of <hi>Miniſters</hi> (till they ſhall ſee a clearer <hi>rain-bow</hi> of <hi>aſſurance</hi> appearing in the Engliſh firmament, for their favour and ſecurity, than yet hath been ſeen) that they have continual damps on all their ſpirits, great and daily checks in their ſtudies, induſtry and ingenuity. Few of them can be ſo <hi>good husbands</hi> in theſe times, as to lay up any thing out of their <hi>livings</hi> for poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: nor dare they be ſo provident, as to lay out any thing upon the glebes or houſes of their livings, either for their after-benefit, or preſent conveniency, becauſe they know not (beſides the hazards of mortality) what a <hi>day or a night may bring forth</hi>; uncertain how ſoon they may be undermined, and together with their miſerable families turned out of that houſe and home, which heretofore was counted their free-hold by law, till by law they had forfeited them.

his neceſſity or impotency, but his gracious choice, by being <hi>poor</hi> to <hi>enrich</hi> us; but <hi>poor Miniſters</hi> are not armed (as Chriſt was) with <hi>miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ſupplies</hi> when they pleaſe, nor may they now expect to be cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with ſuch devout donaries and charitable oblations, as in primitive times were remarkable for their munificence, amplitude and ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour; of which the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles,</hi> the after-Church-hiſtories, and <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus</hi> in the fourth Century give us accounts. Alas, this age is an <hi>iron age</hi>; and mens eſtates are not generally more impaired than their hands are withered, and their hearts <hi>petrified:</hi> theſe are hardned in many, the others are exhauſted in moſt. Mens minds are every where indifferent towards their Miniſters; in many places they are divided from them, and their ſpirits exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated againſt them.

If you alſo forſake them, they are utterly loſt, and, as to this world, of all men moſt miſerable. For as to the vulgarity and generality of people, what is there in the beſt condition of any true <hi>Miniſter,</hi> that carryes any thing with it of ſpirit and life, of comfort and encouragement, of vigour and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to thoſe ſtudies and prayers, thoſe pains and parts, thoſe cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities or hoſpitalities which doe become a Miniſter, and which peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple expect from them, though they feed them but with pulſe, the bread and water of affliction, and make them (with their families) look like <hi>Pharaohs lean kine?</hi> what almoſt is there left for their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, either as to future proviſion, or preſent ſubſiſtance? By that time their poore pittances are injuriouſly compounded, and ſlowly payd by dribbets and with infinite delayes; by that time <hi>taxes, tenths,</hi> and <hi>town-rates</hi> are defalked out of their wages; by that time they have ſatisfied the poor and rich in every Pariſh, which alwayes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, as a right and due from their Miniſters, ſomething of charity and hoſpitality, be their Livings never ſo ſmall; by that time the <hi>upper</hi> and the <hi>nether milſtones,</hi> private neceſſities and publique exacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, have ground theſe poore men; alas, how little will be left for neceſſity, how nothing for conveniency, how leſſe than nothing for poſterity? You may deſpaire of any ſuch ſuperfluity as ſhould ſerve for any ſuch great, good, and generous deſigns, as the Clergie in former times did effect, both for piety and publique charity. Their Livings, at beſt, are but for life; and (now) many times upon a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry verticall point, an arbitrary and uncertain account: Beſides, they are many wayes peeled and exhauſted beyond any mens eſtates, pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not onely <hi>civil Taxes</hi> and Subſidies for their Tithes, after the rate of <hi>Land of Inheritance,</hi> but <hi>Firſt-fruits</hi> alſo and <hi>Tenths,</hi> as a Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Tax and ſpeciall mulct upon them. Truly, for my part, I am ſo far from ſeeing any cauſe for men to envy and grudge at Miniſters enjoyments, ſuch as they are for the moſt part, that I rather wonder at many of their ſubſiſtence, conſidering how ill it becomes their breeding and calling, to debaſe themſelves to any ſordid and mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick wayes of gain.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His I write to you (O nobler Chriſtians,<note place="margin">Experimental inſtances how petulant ſome people are to their Miniſters.</note> and my <hi>Honoured Countrymen</hi>) as with great certainty, ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and ſympathy, in regard of my <hi>Brethren</hi> the <hi>Ministers</hi> of this Church; ſo with the greater <hi>free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> becauſe it neither hath been, nor is my par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular caſe (through <hi>Gods mercy</hi>) either to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably injured, or in any degree over-awed by common people, much leſſe by any men in Power, either Military or Civill: Nor have I any cauſe to complain of the generality of <hi>my own people,</hi> as to any want of juſtice, gratitude, or civility expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from perſons of their ſize and proportion.</p>
               <p>Yet my own experience teacheth me to have the more ſenſible belief of many other <hi>Miniſters</hi> ſad complaints, who having (it may be) leſſe advantages above their people, and much depending upon them, are forced in a very low poſture to <hi>truckle</hi> under ſuch factious, imperious, and injurious ſpirits as they meet withall.</p>
               <p>There is, I find, no flock of <hi>Pigeons</hi> ſo pure and entire, but there will be ſome <hi>Stares, Jack-dawes</hi> and <hi>Rooks</hi> among them; no people ſo modeſt and ingenuous, ſo reſpective and ſubmiſſive to their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, but there will be ſome ſurly and ſupercilious, petulant and inſolent ſpirits among them. No Miniſter of any good name and merit is ſo exalted in the love and reſpect of his people, but he will have ſome <hi>meſſenger of Satan to buffet him</hi>; ſome <hi>Judas</hi> among his Diſciples, that will be prone to betray him, to traduce him privately and publiquely, to make him an <hi>offender for a word,</hi> to ſuck poyſon as Spiders out of the ſweeteſt flowers of his zeal, piety, charity, and oratory; turning honey into gall, and requiting evill for good.</p>
               <p>I could give you (if you wanted daily experiences) ſome neer and notable inſtances, how reſpective, how gentle, how good-natur'd, how gratefull, how civill ſome people are to their <hi>Miniſters,</hi> ſince they have taken the <hi>liberty</hi> to be rude, petulant, inſolent, <hi>unholy, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull.</hi> I have ſeen how much they diſdain to pay any more civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity or outward reſpect to their Miniſter, than they challenge to themſelves, or than they give to their meaneſt <hi>comrades,</hi> which are of the ſame bran and barrell with themſelves: yea ſome of them have taken a glory and pleaſure to ſhew incivility, rudeneſſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuouſneſſe in words and behaviour as well as looks; more paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate, malapert, and imperious to their Miniſters, than they durſt be toward a <hi>petty Conſtable,</hi> or a <hi>Bum-baily:</hi> ſome of them ſo unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that for twice ſeven years conſtant pains among them, they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver returned any <hi>acknowledgment</hi>: ſome have not been aſhamed to uſe down-right railing, ſcorn and ruffling to their faces, others behind their back. Some are ſo conceited of themſelves, that they have
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:97412:142"/>
adventured to dictate and preſcribe in a way even haughty and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacing, what their <hi>Minister</hi> ſhould doe and ſay. There want not ſome <hi>aguiſh</hi> and <hi>feaveriſh Auditors,</hi> who heare onely by fits, when they liſt: others are great <hi>criticks</hi> and ſevere cenſurers, whoſe wanton curioſity uſeth <hi>Sermons,</hi> as <hi>Walnuts</hi>; they crack them, and peel them, and caſt away the greateſt part of them with great nicety, eating little, and digeſting leſſe of ſound doctrine. Some have high conceits that they can preach better than my ſelf, I or any Miniſter. Some have begun a clowniſh conteſt with their Miniſter at the Font, bringing their children to Baptiſm with ſuch indifferency, as when one was asked by his Miniſter, if he deſired to have his child baptized in the Chriſtian Faith, he anſwered very ſurlily, <hi>Yes, if you can doe it.</hi> Another with great peremptorineſſe refuſed to have his Child baptized, unleſſe the Miniſter would doe it himſelf, though he pleaded (with truth) his great wearineſſe after twice Preaching that day, and deſired ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Miniſter then aſſiſtant and preſent might doe it, as was uſuall: But he, <hi>ſtiffe-girl,</hi> and <hi>inexorable,</hi> went with a ſhort turn out of the Church, carrying his child with him, nor ever after offered it, that I know, to be baptized, although he was intreated with great gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs and kindneſs. Theſe are the religious demeanours and deeds of ſome people that I have known.</p>
               <p>Nor am I a ſtranger to thoſe <hi>garlands</hi> and <hi>flowers</hi> of <hi>ruſtick ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory</hi> and civil behaviour, wherewith ſome true plebeians do crown the heads of their <hi>Miniſters,</hi> with as much love and reſpect as thoſe did, who <hi>platted a crown of thorns on Christs head.</hi> I have heard and read the language of ſome of their tongues and pens too, for they dare to <hi>ſcribble</hi> as well as <hi>babble</hi>; nor doth their <hi>gooſe-quill</hi> want teeth any more than their <hi>lips</hi> do the <hi>poyſon of Aſps,</hi> ſufficient to exerciſe the beſt <hi>Antidotes</hi> of Chriſtian patience and charity, which any true Miniſter bears about him. I have ſeen ſometime the viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <hi>letters</hi> of ſome of theſe <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> as full of contempt, inſolency and menacing, as their little wits and great malice could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent: and this from ſuch as have been ſometime perſonally obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and to whom their Miniſter willingly never gave the leaſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. No <hi>touch-wood</hi> or dry <hi>gun-powder</hi> ſooner kindles to flames of wrath, indignation and diſdain, than ſome ordinary and mean men dare, yea delight, now to do againſt their Miniſters. I have ſeen both by their paſquils and practiſes ſome inſtances of their ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous manners, of their great reſpects, love and gratitude: all which (in good earneſt) I might (I think without any vanity) have chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged and expected from all men, eſpecially from my own Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhioners and auditors, whom for many years I have endeavoured to entertain with ſo much induſtry, civility, candour, charity and hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, as is not inferiour to moſt (if any) Miniſters in the countrey; and in ſome things, as to publick charges and burthens, I believe I have exceeded any man of my eſtate and calling in <hi>England.</hi> As for private charities to the poorer and richer, to the well and the ſick, for food, phyſick, clothing, &amp;c. it is fitter others aſſert me, than I
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:97412:142"/>
ſhould vindicate my ſelf againſt the <hi>petulant ingratitudes</hi> of ſome men; among whom one had his tongue ſo much at <hi>liberty,</hi> that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>injured, unprovoked, yea almoſt unknown to me (yet one of my many hearers) he doubted not openly to joyn me with my man, and put upon us both the title of a <hi>couple of proud Jack anapeſes,</hi> when he was but, after two or three years forbearance, demanded to pay what was due, profeſſing he would not maintain any <hi>proud Parſon.</hi> Such ſpirits as theſe I muſt leave to be puniſhed with their own manners; I muſt pardon them, as <hi>David</hi> did <hi>Shimei,</hi> and pray for them, as <hi>Samuel did for the ingrateful Iſraelites:</hi> the rather, becauſe, I thank God, I meet with few of them in a very <hi>numerous people,</hi> who for the greater and better part of them, do indeed deſerve all that care, love, labour, kindneſs and conſtancy, which I have ſhewed to them for 15 years together.</p>
               <p>Onely by theſe experiments, both my ſelf and others may eaſily conjecture how the <hi>pulſe</hi> of people beats in moſt, if not all places, toward their Miniſters, whatever they be; if they be men of any worth, ſpirits and parts above them. 'Tis ſure enough, that even the beſt of them in the beſt places they meet with, are brought to a low ebb, in compariſon of what reſpect they formerly enjoyed in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed ſome Miniſters (perhaps) have ſome little ſleights and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular artifices to win and pleaſe the <hi>vulgar</hi>; whom rather than of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, they will do, or ſay, or omit, or ſilence any thing, not groſly a ſin and ſhame; and rather than not pleaſe, they will rub ever and anon ſome ſalt upon the Biſhops, the ancient Clergy, upon the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy and the former conſtitution of the <hi>Church of England:</hi> for this gall is honey to the palates of ſome plebeian ſpirits. And rather than diſpleaſe ſome people, there are Miniſters that will never uſe the <hi>Creed, Decalogue,</hi> or <hi>Lords prayer</hi> in twice ſeven years. Nay ſome people ſo rule the tender mouths, and ride the <hi>galled backs</hi> of their Preachers with ſo ſharp a ſnaffle and hard a ſaddle, that they are afraid to offend theſe their great Cenſors (rather than good <hi>Maſters</hi> and <hi>Dames</hi>) by putting the title of <hi>Saint</hi> to any holy <hi>Evangeliſt,</hi> or <hi>Apoſtotick writer,</hi> no not when they name their <hi>Text,</hi> or cite any place out of their holy writings; but thoſe holy and reverend men are named with as little reſpect or honor to their memory and merit in the Church, as if they ſpake to <hi>Matthew,</hi> and <hi>James,</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> in their kitchin, as their ſervants, or fellowes and familiars. Yea ſo ſpongily ſoft, timorous and ſequacious ſome <hi>Miniſters</hi> are, that what they own as their judgement among men of learning, parts and courage, this they ſmother with great warineſs and cowardiſe among thoſe plainer <hi>Hees</hi> and <hi>Shees,</hi> by whom they are over-awed, as it were, by a kind of <hi>neceſſary ſportulary dependence.</hi>

               <p>All which calamities have faln ſo thick upon them in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and reputation, in their eſtates and quiet, in their calling and employment, that none, but very ingenuous minds and compaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate hearts, are apt or able to conſider fully thoſe ſad <hi>talents of lead</hi> which lie upon many or moſt Miniſters.</p>
               <p>Their <hi>private cloſets</hi> are almoſt daily witneſſes to their ſighs, tears, prayers, bitter complaints, deſpondencies, and almoſt deſpairs: many of them ready, with <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> to <hi>curſe the day of their birth,</hi>

               <p>All which griefs and dejections, however they ſtrive, many of them, by a <hi>generous magnanimity,</hi> to conceal and ſmother, as much as is poſſible (knowing how vain a thing it is to complain, where is no

hope but of pity, and ſcarce that;) yet many of their neighbours, both friends and enemies, are ſo much curious ſpectators of their diſtreſſes and diſcouragements, that the one hath the pleaſure to <hi>pity</hi> them, the other to <hi>inſult</hi> over them. Which diſmall reflections when the poor Miniſters diſcern in mens looks, words, treatments and comportments toward them, how do they ruminate afreſh, and chew over their <hi>calamities,</hi> when they retire home, and hide their heads in their ruinous and uncertain habitations, which daily, with their maſters, fall to dilapidations? Miniſters having neither money to lay out, nor hearts, if they had money, to repaire ſuch <hi>uncertain,</hi> and, it may be, <hi>momentary manſions,</hi> where every relation they meet renews their <hi>regrets</hi> and <hi>vexations,</hi> both as to their private and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick condition; when they conſider how much they and their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion are faln in <hi>England,</hi> as to all former civil and ſecular intereſts, either honourable, or honeſt and comely, and forced to ſtoop to thoſe that make them their foot-ſtool,<note place="margin">Iſa. 51.23.</note> commanding them to bow down, that they may go over their backs.</p>
               <p>When they hope a little to divert their <hi>melancholy</hi> thoughts, by going abroad and meeting with other men; with what force and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation do Miniſters contend to put on ſo much brow and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as may keep them from appearing too ſenſible of their being every where diſcountenanced and deſpiſed as <hi>Miniſters</hi>? Hence they think themſelves ſafeſt, when they are moſt diſguiſed in their clothes, both for <hi>colour</hi> and <hi>faſhion,</hi> ſuch as may leaſt <hi>bewray</hi> them and their pitifull profeſſion; being <hi>Miniſters</hi> now rather by force and fatall neceſſity, than of any good will, choice, or ſelf-comprobation, finding the beſt of their condition, preferment and expectation amounts not beyond a diſpirited, dejected, deſpiſed, decayed, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious, proletary, predicant, not many degrees removed from a mendicant, condition.</p>
               <p>Thus while the <hi>Souldier</hi> looks big, and glories to be ſeen in his arms, as the enſigns of his well-paid profeſſion; while wary <hi>Lawyers</hi> keep as grave and wiſe men to their <hi>robes</hi> and <hi>gowns,</hi> as badges of their calling, which is their honour and gain too; while other civil <hi>fraternities</hi> and <hi>companies</hi> of trades own their <hi>veſts</hi> and <hi>liveries</hi>; onely the poor <hi>Miniſters</hi> of <hi>England</hi> ſtudy with great artifice to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe themſelves, as manifeſtly, and not a little aſhamed of their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and function; and this not onely in <hi>high-wayes</hi> and <hi>markets,</hi> but even in their very <hi>Churches</hi> and <hi>Pulpits:</hi> they had rather appear as <hi>Lawyers, Phyſitians, Troopers, Graſiers,</hi> yea, <hi>Mechanicks, Apprentices</hi> and <hi>Serving-men,</hi> than in ſuch a colour, garment, garb and faſhion, as beſt becomes (in my judgement) grave Scholars and venerable Preachers: ſo great is the damp and diſcountenance they are ſenſible of, when they come among <hi>Lay-men,</hi> being alwayes loth, and oft afraid to be taken for <hi>Miniſters,</hi> leſt they be openly diſgraced, jeered and contemned: this makes many leave off their wearing black, when they have cauſe enough to be in mourning.</p>
               <p>There is yet one <hi>relief</hi> onely left them, by which a little to buoy

               <p>Which diſtemper and giddineſs in their heads and hearts they have contracted, chiefly, by beholding that unſettledneſs, looſeneſs, giddineſs, variety, irreverence, contempt and confuſion, which hath been caſt upon the face of the <hi>Reformed Religion</hi> and this <hi>Church of England:</hi> for ſince they came to any years of diſcretion, and a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, as men, to judge of humane affairs, they have ſeen nothing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged with leſs diſcretion, gravity and judiciouſneſs, than the publick intereſts of the Reformed Religion and this Church.

               <p>Beſides theſe miſchiefes, which I have already ſet forth to you my <hi>Honoured Countrymen</hi>; there is a ſecond ſad and bad <hi>conſequence,</hi> which, like a <hi>Gangrene</hi> or ſpreading <hi>Canker,</hi> daily <hi>frets</hi> the <hi>ſpirits,</hi> and as it were eats up the very <hi>ſubſtance</hi> and vitals of <hi>Religion</hi> in this Nation, by reaſon of thoſe <hi>endleſſe</hi> and <hi>vexatious diſputes,</hi> which agitate the ſpirits and exaſperate the minds of all ſorts of Chriſtians: and of none ſo much as <hi>Miniſters,</hi> who are looked upon as thoſe that expoſe and offer themſelves to be the chief heads or <hi>Champions of Religion,</hi> in their ſeverall parties; who are to undertake the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates</hi> and challenges of all <hi>oppoſers:</hi> which truly were no very hard province, if either <hi>Miniſters</hi> were <hi>unanimous,</hi> and mutually aſſiſted by concurrent judgement among themſelves; or if they were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected by the <hi>ſhield</hi> of this Churches declared <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and uniform profeſſion of Religion. Which heretofore was juſtly eſteemed as ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, inviolable, and <hi>invulnerable</hi>: having its ſtrength and materialls from the <hi>Scripture</hi>; its model, manner, and compoſure from the counſell, wiſdome, experience and authority, not onely of this <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> but of the <hi>Primitive, Ancient, Catholick Church</hi> in all ages and places; againſt all which few men had heretofore the <hi>confidence,</hi> or indeed impudence, in any grand part, much leſſe in the whole, to oppoſe their private fancies and ſuggeſtions.</p>
               <p>Now, no <hi>petty people</hi> are ſo clowniſh or inconſiderable, but they dare to cavil, queſtion or deny, almoſt every point owned as <hi>Religion</hi> in the Church of England.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not need to inſtance in the grand <hi>Myſteries of the Trinity, Christs Divinity,</hi> his <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> to divine juſtice; in the <hi>reſurrection of the body,</hi> or the <hi>ſouls immortality</hi>; nor yet in the point of <hi>Originall

Sin,</hi> or naturall depravedneſs and defects; of <hi>the neceſsity of Divine Grace</hi>; of Chriſtians <hi>imperfection</hi> in the beſt ſtate of this life; of the right uſe of the <hi>Morall Law,</hi> and the true bounds of Evangelicall Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties. All which (with many other grand <hi>concernments</hi> of Religion) are daily not onely ventilated and diſcuſſed, but contradicted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed by many Modern <hi>Arrians, Socinians, Pelagians, Antinomians, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatians,</hi> and <hi>others,</hi> (beſides the conſtant Controverſies of Papiſts) ſo far, that nothing almoſt is left ſound or ſetled among us; nothing that any Miniſter can preach or practice as Religion, but ſomewhere or other it finds much ſnarling, quarrelling, and gain-ſaying. Every <hi>croſſe-grain'd</hi> piece of pride; or peeviſhneſſe, or ignorance, adventures to bark at what they liſt, yea to bite, tear and <hi>worry</hi> the reputation and integrity, together with the learning and ability of any, yea all the true <hi>Miniſters</hi> of <hi>England</hi>: who are become miſerable, not onely by that great and <hi>unintermitted</hi> pains which they muſt take, if they will be faithfull to their own and other mens ſouls; nor yet by that biting poverty or tenuity of their worldly condition, for the moſt part of them, which is ſo hardly to be relieved by thoſe <hi>dribliting pittances</hi> which, with <hi>tedious attendings</hi> and ſhamefull <hi>importunings,</hi> they can get in.</p>
               <p>But beyond both theſe, Miniſters are in ſuch a ſtate of perpetuall inquietude, as is like that of very <hi>poore people,</hi> who are onely rich in <hi>vermine,</hi> and ſo troubled with them, that they are not permitted night or day to take their reſt, or to enjoy that ſweet ſleep and quiet repoſe indulged to all creatures, by which they might ſometime de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their ſore labour, and forget both their miſeries and their ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes. For when all is done that belongs to a ſober Miniſters mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſteriall duty and charge; after indefatigable paines, continuall ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, invincible patience, which, like <hi>Oſtridges,</hi> muſt digeſt the <hi>iron morſels</hi> and manners of this age; when deſpairing and made incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of any <hi>honorary rewards</hi> in Church or State, anſwerable to his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and merit every way, he onely <hi>covets</hi> for ſome <hi>ingenuous reſt</hi> and tranquillity under the ſhadow and protection of that <hi>Church</hi> and State, which he hath a long time faithfully ſerved; yet then, even in his age, and at all times, he muſt be ſummoned with daily <hi>alarmes,</hi> and provoked to <hi>ſucceſsive duels,</hi> by all ſorts of factious and fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Spirits, new or old, who liſt to be <hi>contentious</hi> T. though he be wearied, and almoſt tired with the long and conſtant <hi>fatigations</hi> of his Miniſtery; though he be almoſt naked and unarmed, as to the <hi>pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick</hi> or <hi>controverſall</hi> part of Divinity; yet muſt he be <hi>compaſſed</hi> with Briars and <hi>Thornes</hi>; frequently moleſted with the perverſe diſputes and <hi>endleſſe janglings</hi> of thoſe, who have no reverence to this Church, nor the <hi>Catholick Churches</hi> conſtant opinion or practiſe, grounded upon Scripture, and manifeſted by undeniable Tradition.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Miniſters of England</hi> are the common <hi>Butt,</hi> at which every <hi>fooles bolt</hi> is preſently <hi>ſhot.</hi> If any be leſſe apt for diſputation, through unwontedneſſe, weakneſſe, depreſſions, poverty, and infinite diſ-ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and ſo (poſſibly) leſſe able on the ſudden to defend that truth,

If the enemies of the <hi>Church of England</hi> would lay aſide their <hi>Swords</hi> and <hi>Piſtols,</hi> their <hi>Troopers</hi> and <hi>Musketeers,</hi> their <hi>Guns</hi> and <hi>Canons,</hi> which have been ſo oft their Seconds, and ſo alwaies a terror to the true <hi>Clergy of England</hi>; if they would keep to the liſts and weapons of Scripture and reaſon, of <hi>Catholick example,</hi> and <hi>conſtant tradition,</hi> (which armes are proper for Religious conteſts;) I believe they would be eaſily ſo matched in every point, that they would have no cauſe long to boaſt of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the better of any Learned and Grave Miniſter, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to aſſert the cauſe of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> both in its Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Diſcipline.</p>
               <p>Which is indeed aſſiſted not onely by the <hi>Spirit</hi> and ſuffrage of all eſtates in this <hi>Church,</hi> as Chriſtian and reformed, as ancient and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern; but alſo by the wiſdome and conſent, the judgement and practiſe of all the famous and flouriſhing Primitive Churches throughout the world: ſo that the juſtification and honour of the Church of <hi>England</hi> depends not upon any one <hi>Miniſters</hi> weakneſſe or ability, but upon that ſolidity, juncture, and conformity it hath, in all the main parts of it, with the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> of Chriſt in all Ages.

               <p>As for the <hi>condition</hi> limiting perſons <hi>baptizable,</hi> which is actual belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, this alſo the <hi>Church</hi> of Chriſt underſtood in a limited &amp; tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary ſenſe, as reaching only to thoſe who were the firſt <hi>fruits</hi> or plants of the Chriſtian Church;<note place="margin">Gen. 17.10.</note> who were firſt (as <hi>Abraham</hi>) to be taught the nature of the <hi>covenant, duty</hi> and ſeal, before they could reaſonably <hi>receive</hi> the <hi>ſign,</hi> or communicate it <hi>rightly to their children:</hi> who come to their <hi>claim</hi> and priviledge, as of <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> ſo of <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> not by vertue of their <hi>perſonal knowledge</hi> and faith, which <hi>Abraham</hi> and men grown, but not their children, firſt had, and ſo the firſt called and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Chriſtians (as parents) ought to have; but by that <hi>federal rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> which they have, even in their <hi>ignorance</hi> and <hi>infancy,</hi> to believing parents, and by them to God, as his people, part of his flock and Church.</p>
               <p>And this, not by a <hi>naturall</hi> or <hi>civil right</hi> (which (yet) deſcends to and upon children, when they know nothing) but by an <hi>Evangelicall right,</hi> as to that <hi>covenant</hi> made by God <hi>in the blood of Chriſt,</hi> with his Church, both of <hi>old</hi> and of <hi>late,</hi> with <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians, incluſive of children,</hi> yea, even <hi>Infants</hi> of eight dayes old; as is evident in <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion,</hi> which ſignified the ſame grace under another ſigne or <hi>ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony,</hi> as the Apoſtle declares it at large, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>Leaving therefore the <hi>cavilling</hi> and <hi>pervicacious inſiſtings</hi> of the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> about the letters, names and ſyllables, which they muſt have, or they will not believe <hi>Infant-Baptiſm,</hi> more than <hi>Thomas Chriſts Reſurrection</hi> till he felt his wounds: although we grant what they alledge as to the nominal ſilence of the word <hi>Infants, wreſted</hi> by their <hi>perverſe diſputations</hi>; yet nothing is abated as to the <hi>right</hi> and uſe of <hi>Infant-baptiſme,</hi> which is grounded upon ſo many <hi>grand reaſonings</hi> and <hi>right deductions</hi> from Scripture-ſenſe; which being explicite and clear in many places, ought to over-rule that ſilence of the name <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,</hi> and ſeeming (but miſunderſtood) limitation of taught and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, which is all the force (upon the point) that ever the <hi>Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts</hi> could muſter together againſt the Churches Catholick judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and practiſe, conform to the whole tenour of Gods mind and will, his love and mercy; Chriſts grace and merits diſpenſed to his Church by ſome <hi>initiall Sacrament,</hi> including Infants as well as the <hi>adulti</hi> of riper years.</p>

               <p>The firſt great hinderance is,<note place="margin">1.

that of <hi>Rome,</hi> or to be <hi>ſubject to it</hi>; ſo nor did the ancient <hi>Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Lawes</hi> and <hi>diſtinctions</hi> lay more to the <hi>Roman Inſpection</hi> or <hi>Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,</hi> than the <hi>Suburbicarian Regions,</hi> which extended 100 miles from the City.

               <p>How much more worthy of the Learning, Prudence, Antiquity, Gravity, ſeeming Piety and affected Majeſty of that <hi>Roman Church,</hi> were it, for them to glory in nothing ſo much as in the <hi>knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt</hi> and <hi>him crucified</hi>; in conforming all things of <hi>Religion</hi> to his Word and example, which hath the trueſt <hi>Antiquity,</hi> onely <hi>Infallibility</hi> and <hi>eminency</hi> upon it; yea, and where they ſee, as by the <hi>light of the Sun</hi> at noon-day, there hath been either <hi>aberration</hi> from, or addition to the <hi>rule</hi> and <hi>pattern</hi> of Chriſt, through the ignorance, or errour, or policy of former Ages and Perſons, there to <hi>return</hi> with ſuch holy and handſome <hi>Reformations</hi> to a <hi>conformity</hi> with Chriſt and the ancient <hi>Roman purity,</hi> as will make no leſſe for the glory of the preſent <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> than it was ſome <hi>eclipſe</hi> and <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution</hi> to their predeceſſors, to ſuffer ſo much <hi>tares</hi> to be ſcattered among <hi>Chriſt's good wheat,</hi> which by Apoſtolick hands was firſt <hi>ſown</hi> and <hi>watered,</hi> to mighty <hi>increaſes</hi> for many hundreds of year?

               <p>So in other things, as <hi>praying to Angels and Saints, worſhipping be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Images, praying and offering for the dead,</hi> in order to <hi>mend their condition</hi>; how would it no way abate <hi>Chriſtian verity,</hi> or <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,</hi> or <hi>charity,</hi> to lay theſe Superſtructures of ſtraw and ſtubble aſide, when we all believe that we have by Faith in Chriſt <hi>acceſſe</hi> to the <hi>Throne of Grace?</hi> beſides, men would more take care to <hi>live and die holily,</hi> when they leſſe expect <hi>other mens devotions to relieve them after death.</hi> Theſe and many other humane and impertinent, becauſe unprofitable, <hi>additionals</hi> to <hi>Sacraments</hi> and <hi>holy Duties,</hi> how eaſily might they be ſpared without any loſſe to Religion, as with great advantages to Chriſtian and Catholick Communion? Nor ſhould theſe juſt <hi>Reformations</hi> prove any <hi>diminution</hi> to the eſtates or honours of the <hi>Roman Church-men,</hi> if I might have any vote or influence in ſo happy an <hi>agreement</hi>; which laſt jealouſies and feares in matter of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Eſtate, are, I believe, the great wall of <hi>partition</hi> and <hi>terrour,</hi> that keeps off and <hi>ſcares</hi> the wary <hi>Romaniſts</hi> from any thought of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,</hi> ſince they ſee the <hi>Deformities, Uncertainties, Beggeries, Ruines</hi> and <hi>Vaſtations,</hi> which at laſt follow ſome mens <hi>Reformations</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> of <hi>Churches</hi> and <hi>Church-men,</hi> if they be ſuffered to run on as far as popular humours have a mind to gratifie their paſſions with the Spoyls and Scorns of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Church-men.</hi>

Nothing is more for the honour of a Chriſtian Nation, than to have no men in it that would buy Gods Portion, and the Churches Patrimony. 7.

Every mans own experience or conſcience will give him the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt convictions, as to this ſin: and I am of opinion, that no mans Eſtate is ſo <hi>fat</hi> and <hi>thrifty,</hi> by what he hath at firſt, ſecond, or third hand taken or detained from the <hi>Church,</hi> but he feeles the ſharp ſtings and gnawings of his own miſgiving <hi>conſcience,</hi> beſides his <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhed</hi> and <hi>fearfull ſoul</hi>; which juſtly <hi>dreads</hi> to look <hi>Judgement</hi> or <hi>Death</hi> in the face, when he knows how ill account he can give either of <hi>goods</hi> unjuſtly taken and detained from the right owners of them, or (willingly) bought at under rates from a ſecond had.

               <p>Nor will it excuſe ſome men, that they are (upon occaſion) <hi>zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous</hi> to relieve poor <hi>Miniſters</hi> and other diſtreſſed <hi>Proteſtants</hi> abroad, if they help to undoe and impoveriſh their own <hi>Pastors</hi> at home.

               <p>For among theſe there are a ſort of people who affect <hi>Supremacy</hi> in Church and State too, a <hi>ſpirituall</hi> and <hi>temporall</hi> Dominion, no leſs than doth the <hi>Pope of Rome:</hi> there are among them many petty Popes, who would fain be the great and onely Dictators of <hi>Religion</hi>; whoſe opinionative pride and projects are as yet of a leſſer volume &amp; blinder print, but they every day meditate &amp; agitate new Editions of their power, and larger additions to their parties and deſignes; being as <hi>infallible</hi> in their own conceits, as imperious in their ſpirits, and as magiſteriall in their cenſures, as the proudeſt <hi>Popes of Rome</hi>; not doubting to condemn and excommunicate any private Chriſtians and Miniſters, yea whole Chriſtian Churches, yea and the beſt Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the world (ſuch as <hi>England</hi> was) if they be not juſt of their form and faſhion, or if they will not patiently ſubmit to their mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiform and deformed <hi>Reformations,</hi> by which they daily wire-draw true <hi>Reformation</hi> to ſuch a ſmall thread, that loſing its ſtrength and integrity, it muſt needs ſnap in pieces and become uſeleſſe: the ſtrange fires of blind, popular, prepoſterous and ſacrilegious <hi>Zeal</hi> ſo overboyling true <hi>Religion</hi> and ſober <hi>Reformation,</hi> till they are ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly confounded and quenched with ſuch ſordid and ſhamefull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formities, as muſt needs follow their Diviſions, Diſtractions and Deſpiciencies, as to all Church-order, Chriſtian unity and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteriall authority.

Truth: and we know that parts <hi>diametrally oppoſite</hi> to each other may (yet) make up the ſame <hi>circumference,</hi> and be at equal diſtance from the <hi>centre</hi>; ſo may Practiſes and Opinions which ſeem moſt croſſe againſt each other, yet, as <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate,</hi> alike conſpire againſt Chriſt and true Religion, like <hi>vicious extremes,</hi> which are contrary to each other, and yet uncorreſpondent with that <hi>vertue</hi> from which they are divided.</p>
               <p>They are children in underſtanding who do not already diſcern and deplore (what wiſe and godly men have long ago <hi>foreſeen</hi> and <hi>foretold</hi>) that by theſe two, <hi>Papall policy</hi> and <hi>fanatick fury,</hi> the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions of the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> and the confuſions of <hi>Schiſmaticks,</hi> the happy ſtate of the <hi>reformed Church of England</hi> was alwayes in danger to be mocked, ſtripped, wounded and crucified: ſome men already fancy, that they ſee it weeping and bleeding, crying and dying, uſing in its ſad <hi>expirings</hi> the laſt words of its Saviour; firſt, to her <hi>God, Why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> next, for her <hi>Enemies</hi> and <hi>Deſtroyers, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, forgive them, they know not what they do.</hi> While the <hi>Papiſts</hi> on the one ſide <hi>rob God of his glory,</hi> giving <hi>religious worſhip</hi> to Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: the <hi>Sacrilegiſts</hi> on the other ſide <hi>rob God</hi> and the <hi>Church,</hi> their Mother, Fathers, and Brethren, of that double Honour, Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and Reverence, Authority and competency, which is due to them, and was ſetled upon them, ſnatching away the <hi>childrens bread</hi> that they may give it to <hi>dogs,</hi> to greedy and <hi>grinning</hi> men, authors and fautors of all our <hi>rents</hi> and <hi>confuſions</hi>; who (as the Pſalmiſt expreſſeth it) <hi>run up and down through every County, City,</hi>

               <p>Thus while the Papiſts too much pamper &amp; <hi>overcharge</hi> Religion with Pomp and Luxury, with ſuperfluous <hi>Ceremonies</hi> and <hi>Superſtitions</hi>; while the Fanaticks ſtrive to <hi>underfeed</hi> and ſtarve it to a deſpicable feebleneſſe and deformity; both of them are become dangerous ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the true <hi>reformed</hi> ſtate of <hi>Religion,</hi> in this or any Church and Nation, whoſe beſt temper and healthfulleſt conſtitution is made up of <hi>ſincere Truth, unfeigned Charity, liberall Piety, unaffected Decency,</hi> a duly-<hi>ordained Miniſtry</hi> with <hi>just Authority,</hi> and <hi>uninterrupted Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> entertained with <hi>holy moderation</hi> and <hi>humble proſperity.</hi> All which were heretofore as remarkably to be ſeen in the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> as in any Nation under Heaven: which now is in danger to be put upon great <hi>ſtreights,</hi> to run between two Seas and Rocks, like the Ship which carried S. <hi>Paul</hi>; uncertain whether it muſt be deſtroyed by <hi>Papall,</hi> or <hi>popular inſolencies</hi>; whether it ſhall at once be driven and ſplit upon the high rocks of <hi>Popery,</hi> or toſſed with the <hi>Herricano's</hi> of vulgar tempeſts and variety, till it run upon the flats and ſhallows of Sacriledge, and be ſwallowed up by fanatick Quick-ſands.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, theſe inſectiles, the later and leſſer <hi>fry</hi> of novell Sects and various factions in <hi>England,</hi> dayly multiplying and dividing in their Opinions, Religions and Reformations, may poſſibly ſeem to ſome men like ſmall <hi>Pilchards</hi> or <hi>Shotten Herrings,</hi> compared to the great <hi>Whales</hi> and mighty <hi>Leviathans of Rome</hi>; neither ſo dreadfull,

nor ſo dangerous to the <hi>Reformed Religion:</hi> But wiſe men may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that what ſeems wanting in their <hi>Maſſe</hi> and <hi>Bulk,</hi> ſeverally look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on, is made up in their number and <hi>activity</hi>: not onely Sea-<hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> may ſink a ſhip, but ſmall <hi>wormes,</hi> which grow to its ſides and keel, will eat it through and deſtroy it. It is a great deal of miſchief that <hi>Mice</hi> and <hi>Rats, Ants</hi> and <hi>Mites,</hi> will do in a little time to great bodies, if they be let alone.

               </p>
               <p>The fruits and effects of which <hi>African mixtures</hi> and confuſions, every wiſe man may eaſily foretell, being utterly inconſiſtent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with not onely the Sanctity, Charity, Unity, Tranquillity, and Majeſty of Religion, becoming this Reformed Church and Chriſtian State, but with the very civill Peace, freedom and ſecular <hi>Honour</hi> of this Nation. Nor can any ſober perſon tell what any one or all of them, in their <hi>fractions</hi> and <hi>factions,</hi> would be at, either in reſpect of the flouriſhing of Religion, or felicity of the civil ſtate, beyond (or any way comparable to) what was formerly profeſſed, practiſed and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed in this Church and Nation, long before <hi>Satan</hi> had leave thus to winnow the <hi>Church,</hi> with Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> or to ſmite the State, as he did <hi>Job,</hi> with theſe civill <hi>boyles</hi> and <hi>botches.</hi> I know there are ſome grave and godly men (who are well-affected to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and zealous for true <hi>Reformation</hi> in a ſettled and happy way) who do not account theſe Moderne and Minute <hi>Sects,</hi> theſe broken and divided factions, to be any way very dangerous, and ſo not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable to the publick welfare of this Nation, either in Religious or <hi>civill reſpects</hi>; becauſe they think none of them to be of a firme and durable conſtitution, but rather as <hi>Vermine,</hi> bred of <hi>putid</hi> water, in warme, unholeſome, and to them moſt indulgent ſeaſons, between Pride and Peeviſhneſſe, Ignorance and Licentiouſneſſe, Envy and Covetouſneſs, they cannot either continue long, or propagate any laſting <hi>ſucceſsion,</hi> but as <hi>animalls</hi> of a crude, imperfect and equivocall generation, having ſpent that corrupt matter out of which they have both their production and nutrition, they will (like <hi>Magots</hi>) dye of themſelves: as did the <hi>Gnoſticks, Montaniſts, Manichees, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatians,</hi> or <hi>Cathariſts,</hi> the <hi>Aerians, Euchites, Circumcellions, Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts</hi> and others in ancient times, whoſe folly being made manifeſt to all <hi>ſober</hi> Chriſtians,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3.9.</note> it <hi>prevailed</hi> no further. Such creatures in time, like <hi>Snailes,</hi> waſting their ſlimy and indigeſted ſubſtance by their own motions. The <hi>rage</hi> of Hereticks and Schiſmaticks being
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:97412:201"/>
like that of mad <hi>Doggs,</hi> which after they have a while <hi>fomed</hi> and ſnapped here and there, run themſelves to death, and are <hi>tired</hi> by their own <hi>cruell agitations.</hi> Nor will they find many to ſucceed them, eſpecially when once the wiſdome and piety of a Chriſtian <hi>Nation</hi> ſo far recovers, as to cut off and curb that popular, licentious and lazy humour, or to obſtruct thoſe hopes of profit, pleaſure and preferment, which are the <hi>Favonii,</hi> the warme winds, that <hi>impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> theſe creatures. How few would have deſerted, and ſo <hi>defied,</hi> the Church of <hi>England,</hi> (as they have done) if they had not had other temptations than thoſe of conſcience or religious perſwaſions?</p>
               <p>'Tis true, I do not look upon theſe many-headed and miſ-ſhapen factions, which are ſo highly animated againſt the Church of <hi>England,</hi> (being moſt-what like <hi>Monſters,</hi> either <hi>exceſsive</hi> in their <hi>Seraphick Whimſies,</hi> everlaſting Novelties, and affected fancies, or <hi>defective</hi> in that ſound knowledge, that humble, orderly and peaceable chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which becomes true Chriſtians) I do not look upon them as any way apt, or able of themſelves to build an orderly and durable ſtructure, no more than the <hi>Brick-layers</hi> of <hi>Babel,</hi> when their <hi>Tongues</hi> were divided: for I find they are commonly like <hi>Rookes,</hi> which ſtrive to make their own neſts by rifling their <hi>Neighbours.</hi> Little ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid or ſetled, in Reaſon or Religion, in Church or State, is expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from tempers and activities which are like that of <hi>Pioneers</hi> and <hi>Plunderers,</hi> chiefly for undermining and ruining proſtrating and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling, both Churches and States, all Magiſtrates and Miniſters that are either within their reach and stroke, or without their mark and cognizance upon their <hi>fore-heads.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet give me leave to ſuggeſt, yea and to urge upon your moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious conſiderations (O my <hi>Honoured</hi> and <hi>beloved Country-men</hi>) than the <hi>conſequents</hi> neceſſarily attending the divided opinions and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive agitations of thoſe that may ſeem the moſt petty parties, and inconſiderable Sects now in <hi>England,</hi> muſt needs be very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and may in time prove extreamly pernicious to the peace, piety, honour, and welfare of this <hi>Nation</hi>; not onely in reſpect of the <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> whoſe authoritative Miniſtry and maintenance they will ever ſeek to devour and utterly deſtroy, but even in reſpect of ſecular intereſts, and civill peace.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, (The integrity and true intereſts of the Reformed Religion,) who, that hath read what I have already, not more paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onately then impartially written, can be ſo blind, as not to ſee, That the pride, petulancy and deſpite, the ignorance, licentiouſneſſe and covetouſneſs of ſome of theſe men, hath been and ſtill is ſuch, that they have not onely ſought to waſt and deforme, to reproach and defame all that outward order, viſible beauty, polity, ſupport and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which became ſo famous a <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Nation</hi>; but they have further ſtudied to weaken and deſtroy the moſt ſolid and eſſentiall parts of <hi>Religion,</hi> by many groſſe errours, <hi>damnable Doctrines,</hi> bold blaſphemies, high Atheiſmes and rude immoralities? all which do naturally boile up in the corrupt hearts and violent luſts of mankinde,
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:97412:202"/>
when they have any fire of temptation, or encouragement. What is then ſo immodeſt, ſo impudent againſt the glory of God, againſt the honour of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, againſt the written word of God, againſt the reputation of the Catholick, or any well-reformed <hi>Church,</hi> againſt the Lawes of nature, civill ſocieties and common ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, againſt the good of men and Chriſtians, their temporall and eternall welfare, which ſome of theſe <hi>Abaddons,</hi> theſe <hi>Apollyons</hi> will not adventure to broach and abet, to act, own and applaud, when they ſee their <hi>raveries</hi> are apt not onely to amuſe the <hi>vulgar people,</hi> but to mend their own <hi>fortunes,</hi> which are the firſt and neereſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes they aime at,<note place="margin">Finis operantis &amp; operis.</note> as the chief ends of the agents?</p>
               <p>But the <hi>end</hi> or <hi>effect</hi> following their <hi>actions,</hi> (though poſſibly not ſome of their intentions) will be this, to prepare by theſe vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous windings, confuſed circulations and diſtorted wreſtings of the Reformed Religion, the way for <hi>Roman</hi> factors, <hi>Papall</hi> intereſts and <hi>Jeſuitick deſignes,</hi> whoſe learned abilities, orderly induſtry, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defatigable activity is ſuch, that by that time the <hi>old stock</hi> of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend, orderly and authoritative Biſhops and Presbyters, (the trueſt and moſt unqueſtionable Miniſters of the Church of Chriſt,) are worn out in <hi>England,</hi> and the reformed Religion is reduced with its titular and extenuated <hi>Miniſters</hi> to a meer <hi>medly,</hi> or popular <hi>Chaos of confuſions</hi>; (the moſt of ſober people being either ſick, or aſhamed, or weary of their home-bred diſorders, and unremedied diſeaſes in Religion) by this time (I ſay) the <hi>Romiſh</hi> agitators will not onely devoure all theſe petty parties, and feeble factions of <hi>Reformers,</hi> with as much eaſe as the <hi>Stork</hi> did the <hi>Froggs</hi>; but they will (in time) utterly deſtroy the remaines of the defamed Doctrine and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion,</hi> which your fore-fathers owned, and to the death profeſſed, as moſt true and well reformed, with great Honour, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, and Happineſs; which yet the ignorance and inſolence, the Illiterateneſs and Ruſticity, the Barrenneſſe and Barbarity of novel Sects have already rendred poor and deſpicable, much to be pitied and deplored both at home and abroad.</p>
               <p>I muſt ever ſo far own my reaſon, as to profeſſe that I look upon the Defamers, Dividers and Deſtroyers of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> whatever they are or ſeem) to be no other than the perdues or forelorn hope of <hi>Popery,</hi> which by lighter skirmiſhes open advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages to the Popes maine <hi>Battaglio</hi>; the <hi>Vancourriers,</hi> or <hi>Harbin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,</hi> ſent and excited (in great part) from the <hi>Pragmatick Policies</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> whoſe grand intereſt ſince the Reformation hath been, not more to advance the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> and preſerve the Papacy, than to regain the <hi>Church of England</hi> to the Romiſh ſlavery.</p>
               <p>In whoſe preſent calamities may eaſily be diſcerned a far greater reach and deeper Spirit, than is uſuall to be found in ordinary <hi>Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> and <hi>Schiſmaticks,</hi> who are commonly of low and mean parts, ſhort-ſighted and ſhort-ſpirited, of very ſhallow wits and extemporary deſignes, rarely aiming at any thing that is of a publick concern, of a grand, notable and durable proportion; but rather gratifying
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:97412:202"/>
their ſudden paſſions and occaſionall fancies or correptions, which are pitifully poor and plebeian, ſeldome reaching higher than the pleaſure of <hi>ſcratching</hi> their own or other mens itching ears with ſome novel fancies and opinions, or ſetting up themſelves by a ſorry <hi>am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition</hi> to be Heads and Leaders, the Paſtors and Teachers of ſome credulous company, which makes it ſelf into ſome new mode, and very ſuperciliouſly calls it ſelf <hi>The Church</hi>; not in charity and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with, but in contempt and defiance of all other <hi>Churches,</hi> Parochiall, Provinciall, Nationall, or Catholick, owning none of the Primitive, Grand and Apoſtolicall Combinations, or their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions, to be truly conſtituted Churches. By ſuch <hi>little arts</hi> ſome of them feed their bellies and cloth their backs better than heretofore, when they made no ſuch <hi>cakes</hi> for their <hi>Queens</hi> of Heaven, nor Shrines for their ſeverall <hi>Diana's,</hi> but were confined to their leſſe <hi>gainfull trades</hi>; ſome of them feed meerly upon <hi>popular breath,</hi> which, as the wind, will never laſt long in one point or corner; laſtly, ſome of them keep up their vulgar Pride and ſad Ambitions by nothing elſe but by the fame of their <hi>Antagoniſts,</hi> the glory they have to conteſt with, the <hi>Church of England</hi> and her ableſt Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, who are (in earneſt) ſo much ſuperiour to theſe ſorry Rivals and Ruiners of them, in all Learning, Religion, Vertue, Wiſdome, Honeſty and Modeſty, as the Stars in the firmament are beyond the glittering of rotten <hi>chips</hi> in the dark, or the ſhining of Glow-wormes in a ditch.</p>
               <p>Certainly theſe petty <hi>parties,</hi> who ſcarce know what they drive at, and are full of varieties in their Fancies, Forms and Factions, theſe cannot produce ſo conſtant a <hi>current</hi> and ſo ſtrong a <hi>tide,</hi> as is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies urging againſt the <hi>Church of Engl.</hi> and the honour of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Religion; but they are driven on by a ſubtill and ſecret, yet potent impulſe, as waves of the ſea, not onely daſhing and breaking upon each other, but (all of them) battering the Honour and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> as the great rampart or <hi>bank</hi> which ſtands in the way of the <hi>Sea of Rome,</hi> mightily oppoſing and hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heretofore both fanatick Confuſions, Papal Uſurpations, and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Superſtitions; whoſe advantages now are evidently prepared and carried on by thoſe, that under the name of <hi>Reformation</hi> will moſt effectually at laſt overthrow it.</p>
               <p>For after theſe <hi>petty ſpirits,</hi> who have been and are the great Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viders, Deſpiſers and Deſtroyers of the reformed <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> have a few years longer played their <hi>mad pranks</hi> in this ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time ſo flouriſhing and fruitfull <hi>vineyard of the Lord,</hi> (pulling up the <hi>hedge</hi> of Eccleſiaſticall Canons, and Civil Sanctions, throwing down the <hi>wall</hi> of Ancient Diſcipline and Catholick Government, breaking in pieces the <hi>wine-preſs</hi> of holy Ordination and Miniſteriall Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Succeſſion, pulling up both <hi>root</hi> and <hi>branch</hi> of holy Plants and regular Planters;) what (I beſeech you) can hinder theſe ſubtill <hi>Foxes</hi> and wild <hi>Boars</hi> of Romiſh Power and Policy, to enter in, and not onely ſecretly, but openly (as occaſion ſhall ſerve) to deſtroy all

Hence he kindles to a zeal in Gods behalf, both to decry all other, and to cry up his own <hi>Religion</hi>; after this he hath potent impulſes to propagate his own, and extirpate all others, as an acceptable ſervice and ſacrifice to God. This he firſt doth by words, diſputing, writing, rayling, reviling: If theſe methods of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting and reforming the wicked world will not ſerve, he concludes them as his and Gods oppoſers to be obſtinate; then he flies to the ſword, firſt in vote, then in uſe, ſo ſoon as he and his party can get number and power ſufficient to act with probable ſafety: ſuch an opportunity he counts a <hi>call</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> an hand of providence, inviting and directing what to do, in order to ſet up their new way, againſt all others never ſo ancient, never ſo approved by good men, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpered by Gods grace and bleſſing: Yea all old things muſt be done away, they muſt make all things new; and their way muſt needs be the new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> meant in the Revelation.</p>

Such as now diſdain her and ſeek to deſtroy her are veniall, if by a retaliation of divine vengeance, they ambitiouſly ſtrive for maſtery againſt each other; each aiming to be like the Maſter-<hi>Pike</hi> in a Pond, which (they think) may lawfully devour thoſe that are of leſſer ſize and growth. 'Tis certain that every faction in Religion hath its feares of oppreſſion, whetting them to mutuall emulations and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions, not knowing what party may, like the beaſts in <hi>Daniel,</hi> get the better over others, if not by arguments, yet by armes: nothing more frequent than thoſe civill conflagrations or burnings of Cities and Countries, whoſe firſt fires are kindled from the Coales of the Altars, from Religious fire-brands caſt by Chriſtians in each others faces.</p>
               <p>We need not go farther to verifie this preſumption, than to the late great <hi>Inſtances</hi> ſo remarkable among our ſelves here in <hi>England,</hi> ſufficiently proving that there can be no civill ſecurity, where there is ſuch a <hi>Religious variety,</hi> as ſerves to give both occaſion and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to different parties, both to excite their private ambitions, and in time to exert them in waies of open hoſtility, whenſoever oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity is given by any negligence, offence, or diſtemper in govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or governours; upon the leaſt bruiſe, the ill humours, as in foul bodies, will have ſuch confluence to the <hi>diſaffected</hi> part, as eaſily cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes terrible <hi>inflammations,</hi> and many times ſuch gangrenes of poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous and indigeſtible humours, as nothing but the <hi>ſword</hi> can cure.</p>
               <p>Not onely <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>France</hi> heretofore have felt the ſad ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of theſe <hi>Religious factions,</hi> frequently embrued in the blood of their Countries; but <hi>Scotland, Ireland</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> have hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had many ſhaking fits of theſe Religious feavers, though never
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:97412:206"/>
any that coſt each of them ſo much letting of blood as theſe laſt Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentures, which have infinitely waſted the people and ſpirits of theſe three Nations, taking their firſt popular heats (or pretending ſo at leaſt) from the zeal each party had for its <hi>Religion,</hi> not as Chriſtian, which all profeſſe, but as diſcriminated by particular marks of leſſer Opinions and Perſwaſions, which occaſion more diſcords than all their agreement in other main matters can preſerve of Love and Concord, as men, as Countrey-men, or Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>How oft ſince the <hi>Reformation</hi> in <hi>England</hi> began, and was perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (to ſo great a beauty, for Juſtice, Piety, Order, Charity, Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and Honour, as became the Glory of God, the Majeſty of Chriſtian Religion, and the Wiſdome of this Nation) have the <hi>ſtruglings</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> threatned, and began civil broyles, not onely in <hi>Henry the eighth</hi>'s dayes, both in the North and Weſt (when yet Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation was much unhewn and unpoliſhed, people being unſatisfied becauſe untaught, as to the juſt grounds of neceſſary Alteration) but afterward, in ſucceeding <hi>Princes</hi> dayes, eſpecially in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s long and happy reign, how infinitely did religious diſcontents <hi>boyle</hi> in ſome mens breaſts? inſomuch that for want of vent in <hi>open flames</hi> of Hoſtility (which the publick Power, Policy and Vigilancy of thoſe times repreſſed) they bred all ſorts of foul <hi>Impoſtumations,</hi> even to the ſtudy of Aſſaſſinations, Empoiſonings and Treaſons; ſome ſo black and barbarous, as are unparallel'd in former, and will be ſcarce credible in after-Ages.</p>
               <p>Nor did the diſcontented <hi>Papiſts</hi> onely meditate firſt revenge, then <hi>Soveraignty,</hi> by blowing all up at one blow that was ſacred or civil in this Nation; but even that little <hi>cloud,</hi> which at firſt ſeemed but as an <hi>hands breadth,</hi> of difference in ſome outward Forms, Ceremonies and Circumſtances of Religion, as Chriſtian and Reformed, this in time grew ſo full of <hi>ſulphurous</hi> or <hi>hot vapours,</hi> that it looked very black when it was not yet very big in <hi>England,</hi> either by <hi>ſchiſmes</hi> or <hi>ſeparations,</hi> being much cooled and allayed, yea in great part diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipated and vaniſhed, through the excellent temper of that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment both in Church and State, which that renowned Queen and her wiſe Councel preſerved; which ſuffered neither Conformity to grow wanton and lazy, nor Non-conformity to be preſumptuous or deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, nor yet too popular, by out-vying the other party either in Piety or Induſtry.</p>
               <p>Epiſcopacy, as the ancient and onely Catholick Government of this and all other Churches for 1500. years, was then had in due <hi>venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> allowed its <hi>double honour,</hi> both in Church and State, in <hi>Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> and <hi>Synods</hi>; it was treated with great gravity and reſpect by that incomparable <hi>Princeſſe</hi>; afterward it was aſſerted with greater indulgence and paſſion by King <hi>James,</hi> who began that Proverb which his Son ſaw verified, <hi>No Biſhop, no King</hi>: yet in the beginning of the late Kings dayes, Epiſcopacy and the ſtate of the Church was even <hi>pampered</hi> and <hi>coſetted</hi> by ſo exceſſive a favour and propenſity, as made it ſeem <hi>his chief Favourite,</hi> not onely for reaſons of State, but
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:97412:207"/>
of Conſcience. The Epiſcopall throne and dignity ſeemed as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable as the Kings Scepter and Majeſty; ſo zealouſly devoted he was to aſſert it, ſo fearfull by any <hi>ſacrilegious</hi> act to diminiſh it; ſuch a <hi>Patron,</hi> ſuch a <hi>Champion</hi> for the State <hi>Eccleſiaſtick,</hi> that upon the matter he was reſolved to venture Kingdomes, Life and all up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this cauſe, and either to ſwimme or ſink with the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> againſt the Tide of all Faction.</p>
               <p>What could be deſired of greater advantage and ſecurity, than ſuch an immenſity of favour from ſo potent a <hi>Monarch,</hi> for the indemnity and ſtability of the Epiſcopall <hi>intereſts</hi> and its <hi>friends</hi> in <hi>England?</hi> which in the Beginning of King <hi>Charles</hi> his reign had what they could hope or deſire; his benignity exceeding the very hopes of <hi>Church-men,</hi> his Royall favour confirming all thoſe Immunities, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, Juriſdictions and Revenues, as ſacred and inviolable, which they enjoyed by the Lawes, Priviledges and Cuſtomes of <hi>England</hi>; to which the Learning, Gravity, and Merit of many worthy Biſhops and other Church-men in <hi>England</hi> bare ſo great and good a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that few were ſo impudently envious, as not to think that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, yea moſt of them, well deſerved what they ſoberly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed?</p>
               <p>The heat of the oppoſite Factions, as <hi>Non-conformiſts</hi> or <hi>Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts,</hi> was ſo much allayed, that it ſeemed quite extinguiſhed: nor poſſibly could it have revived to ſo ſudden and dreadfull flames, if the <hi>immoderations</hi> of ſome mens paſſionate counſels and precipitate activities had not tranſported them beyond thoſe bounds which po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick, and it may be pious, prudence did require; which eaſily re-inkindled thoſe old differences which had been ſo much ſuppreſſed, that they ſeemed quite buried in <hi>England,</hi> till they took freſh and unexpected fires from the cold <hi>climate,</hi> but hot <hi>ſpirits,</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi>; which finding prepared and combuſtible matter there and here too, ſoon brake out to ſuch flames as were not to be quenched but with the beſt <hi>blood</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and the overthrow of the ancient Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment both of Church and State, even then when both ſeemed to be in their greateſt height and fixation.</p>
               <p>So dangerous, even beyond all imagination and expreſſion, are the ſparks of <hi>religious diſſentions,</hi> if they be either by prepoſterous Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions provoked, or by imprudent Negligences permitted to fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſpread in any Church and State, or if they be not by at powerfull way of reall Wiſdome and true Piety (which is the beſt and ſureſt policy) ſo quenched and ſmothered, as may take away from all men of any Worth, Modeſty and Conſcience, any juſt cauſe to endeavour or deſire any ſuch <hi>Innovations</hi> as thoſe did, who upon <hi>Presbyterian principles</hi> firſt aimed at, not a totall change of Doctrine, but onely an amendment of Diſcipline and Government in this Church; which as they ſeemed in a ſhort time to have obtained be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their firſt deſigns, ſo in no long time after they were as much fruſtrated, and ſoon defeated by other ſubſequent parties which ſprang up upon the like grounds of <hi>religious differences.</hi>

                  <pb n="377" facs="tcp:97412:207"/>After Epiſcopacy was thruſt under hatches, what I pray could be more abſolute and Magiſteriall, bigger in words, lookes, enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, in terrours of others, in boaſts and confidences of it ſelf, than the <hi>Presbyterian party</hi> was after once that <hi>Leven,</hi> by a <hi>Scotch maceration</hi> and infuſion, had diffuſed it ſelf, and ſowred many peoples ſimplicity here in <hi>England,</hi> againſt the <hi>Epiſcopall</hi> conſtitution and adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Church? How did this high-flying <hi>Icarus</hi> in a ſhort time diſdain any rivall, puffing at all its <hi>Prelatick adverſaries,</hi> ſetting its feet on all the <hi>Biſhops</hi> and the Epiſcopall Clergies neck, as the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> did on the five Kings of the <hi>Amorites,</hi> before they were to be ſlain? which thing was done at <hi>Joſuahs</hi> command,<note place="margin">Joſ. 10.24.</note> who was the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Magiſtrate: but theſe forward Spirits tarried not for any ſuch command or conſent to their dominion, from the Prince of the people; but their new ſoveraginty fought to ſpread it ſelf like light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in a moment to the latitude of theſe three Kingdomes, impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated and palliated with many popular petitions for Reformation of Religion, which was in effect no more than the ſetting up of a ſole ſoveraign and abſolute Presbytery. A novelty in any other Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Church, whoſe neceſſity, rather than choice, drave them upon it: but in <hi>England</hi> it ſeemed a meer inſolency; yet how was it now to be ſeen flouriſhing with the <hi>Scotch ſword</hi> in one hand, and the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> in the other? How was it heightened by the name and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of <hi>Parlament</hi>? How was it to be Chriſtened and adopted to Chriſt in <hi>England,</hi> by an <hi>Aſſembly of Divines,</hi> who were indeed rather the <hi>Goſsips</hi> and Witneſſes, than the Fathers or begetters of this alien; which was rather a Scotch Runt than of true Engliſh breed? For moſt, if not all the new Patrons and God-fathers of Presbytery, both Gentlemen and Clergy-men, had formerly ſworn to, or ſubſcribed, or aſſerted, or at leaſt cheerfully ſubmitted to the ancient <hi>legall</hi> and <hi>Epiſcopall Government</hi> of the <hi>Church of England.</hi> From which they were ſo ſuddenly, paſſionately warped, and partial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inclined to Presbytery, that although my ſelf were by I know not what ſleight of hand ſhuffled out of that Aſſembly (to which I was as fully choſen as any, and never gave any refuſall to ſit with them, further than my judgement was ſufficiently declared in a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon preached at the firſt ſitting of the <hi>Parlament,</hi> to be for the ancient and Catholick Epiſcopacy;) yet the <hi>Zeal</hi> of ſome men to put <hi>Presbytery</hi> into its throne and exerciſe was ſuch, that I was twice ſent to by ſome members of both Houſes, and ſummoned by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of the County where I live, to preach at the conſecration and inſtalling of this many <hi>headed Biſhop,</hi> the new <hi>Presbytery</hi>: which work I twice (and ſo ever humbly) refuſed to do, as not having ſo ſtudied its <hi>Genealogy</hi> and deſcent, as to be aſſured of the legitimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, right and title of ſole Presbytery, to ſucceed, nay to remove its ancient <hi>Father Epiſcopacy,</hi> not as then quite dead, nor (I think) ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly depoſed. Yet ſuch was the double diligence then of many Engliſh <hi>Divines</hi> (men otherwiſe of uſefull abilities) that they did as offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly attend on the <hi>Scotch Commiſsioners</hi> to ſet up <hi>Presbytery,</hi> and to

               <p>Beſides this, <hi>Preſbytery</hi> had then fortified it ſelf with a ſpeciall piece of policy, in order to its prevalency and perpetuity; which was, to engage the better ſort of <hi>common people,</hi> or the <hi>Maſters</hi> of every Pariſh, and ſo in effect the whole Populacy, to that party, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging them (as Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> did in <hi>Geneva</hi>) a formall or titular ſhare of <hi>Conſiſtorian</hi> or <hi>Eccleſiaſticall</hi> power, under the glorious name of <hi>Ruling Elders,</hi> on whom, as on leſſe <hi>comely members,</hi> they were plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to beſtow more abundant honour, at leaſt in words; for few of them could really be fit for, or ever capable to uſe any actuall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, beyond that of Sides-men, Conſtables, Church-wardens, or Overſeers for the poor.</p>
               <p>Yet muſt the Divine Authority even of theſe pillars to <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery</hi> be ſet up, though it ſtands but on tip-toes, and as it were upon one leg, favoured but by one <hi>Text</hi> of Scripture, and not one example, either in Scripture or all Antiquity for a thouſand yeares and more, as learned Mr. <hi>Chibald</hi> proved in that excellent work of his, which was very ſeaſonably for the deſign, but not very honeſtly, <hi>embezled</hi> by ſome faſt friends to Presbytery, as I have other where complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

               <p>The Apoſtle too well underſtood the proportions of juſtice and remuneration, to give the ſame <hi>double honour</hi> (that is, equall main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and reverence from the <hi>Churches</hi>) to thoſe whoſe <hi>paines</hi> in them muſt be ſo vaſtly different, as well as their abilities; the work of their <hi>ſuppoſed ruling,</hi> but not preaching <hi>Elders,</hi> being no way comparable in Reaſon or Religion to the work and worth of thoſe that duly preach and plant the Goſpell. The <hi>ruling</hi> part, as it was aſſigned them by theſe new <hi>dividers</hi> of <hi>Church-Government,</hi> was ſuch, as required no great time or paines, nor great abilities; which, if required, could not eaſily be had in moſt Country-congregations, much leſſe in primitive times among the <hi>poor</hi> and (for moſt part) <hi>Plebeian</hi> Chriſtians: beſides the <hi>office</hi> doth ſo much gratifie moſt <hi>Lay-mens ſmall ambitions</hi> to be in office, and ſo little hinders their other <hi>trades,</hi> that they cannot be thought to deſerve any <hi>great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> much leſſe double, that is <hi>equall, honour to him</hi> that <hi>expends</hi> moſt of his time, <hi>Spirits,</hi> and talents in preparing and employing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf

               </p>
               <p>But in earneſt, theſe <hi>Ruling Elders</hi> were in prudence, not in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, in reaſon of State, not of Religion, in Policy, not Piety, firſt added to the conſiſtory at <hi>Geneva,</hi> meerly to appeaſe and pleaſe the unſetled people, who having tumultuarily driven out their Biſhop and Prince, now upon the Eſſayes or new modellings of Church and State, would not be quiet, till <hi>Calvin</hi> allowed them ſome that might ſeem <hi>Tribunes</hi> of the people in Courts <hi>Eccleſiaſtick</hi> as well as Civil. Tis true, <hi>Lay-Elders</hi> have been continued and uſed there, and other where, after that plat-forme of ſo-diſciplined Churches; but not therefore any way the more or better reformed. For theſe are rather as Cyphers, adding ſome number, traine and company to the Miniſters, than ſignifying ought of themſelves, further than prudence &amp; policy may make uſe of them: But certainly no Religious neceſſity commands them as a duty and of divine Inſtitution, there being an impoſſibility to find them in every <hi>parochial congregation,</hi> where there is ſeldome any one man of the <hi>Laity,</hi> who is meet in any kind to be joyned with the <hi>Minister,</hi> in any ſuch authority, which claimes to be <hi>Sacred</hi> and <hi>Divine</hi>; for which God ever provides fitting <hi>inſtruments,</hi>

Yet if any Presbyter be ſo wedded to theſe <hi>Lay-Elders,</hi> that he will never be reconciled to <hi>Primitive Epiſcopacy</hi> if he be wholly divorced from his dear Elders, for my part he ſhall have my conſent to enjoy them, upon a politick and prudent account, where he may conveniently have uſe of them. For I do not think the outward <hi>Government</hi> of the Church to be made of ſuch ſtuffe or faſhion which will not in any caſe either ſtretch or ſhrink, as thoſe garments might do on the Jewes bodies, when they ware them forty yeares in the wilderneſſe, provided all things be done <hi>decently</hi> and in <hi>order,</hi> with due regard to the maine end and the beſt exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.

               <p>This is ſure, <hi>Presbytery</hi> was at firſt ſo confident of its ſure ſtanding in <hi>England,</hi> (where it never yet had any footing ſince Chriſtianity was planted) that it doubted not to make uſe of ſuch a <hi>wooden leg</hi> or crutch as <hi>Lay-Elders</hi> are to <hi>ſupport</hi> its new <hi>Government</hi> and <hi>diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline</hi>; which was hereby rendred very popular and ſpecious to many Miniſters, and other men of vulgar <hi>Spirits,</hi> who were more ambitious of any ſmall pittance of Church-Government to paſſe through their fingers, than judicious to meaſure and deſign the true proportions of it or themſelves, which certainly ought to be moſt remote from a <hi>Democratick temper,</hi> Church-Government depending not upon many ſtrong, raſh and rude hands, but upon wiſe heads and holy hearts; of which no great ſtore is ordinarily to be found among common and Country-people, upon which <hi>crab-ſtocks</hi> nevertheleſſe this graft of <hi>Presbyterian</hi> government was to be every where grafted on the one ſide, not without mighty applauſe, and great expectation from the meaner-ſpirited people of <hi>England,</hi> in every pariſh ſome of which were to be found, not onely among the very <hi>Mechanick</hi> and <hi>Ruſtick Plebs</hi> onely, but among ſome Citizens, Gentlemen, and Noblemen too, who began to have very warme and devout ambitions to enjoy the title of a ruling Elder, as a divine honour added to their other civill honours, gently ſubmitting their and their poſterities tamer necks to ſuch a yoke, as neither they nor their fore-fathers ever knew; by which one little Miniſter with two or three of his Elders, might be impowered to excommunicate a King and all his Councell, as King <hi>James</hi> expreſſeth in his ſenſe of their arrogancy.</p>
               <p>But while the common people of <hi>Engl.</hi> were every where preparing themſelves to admire, adore, or dread, yea to entertain and feed with double honour, which was required for its due, this new and ſtrange

beaſt of <hi>Presbytery,</hi> which roſe out of the ſea of <hi>Scotiſh broyles</hi> and <hi>Engliſh troubles</hi> (being, as was thought, adorned with ſeven Heads and ten Horns, coming forth <hi>conquering</hi> and to <hi>conquer</hi>;) in the midſt of ſo great glory, ſwelling confidences and ſuperfluity of ſucceſſes, behold, a little ſtone of <hi>Independency,</hi> cut out by no hand of Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, riſeth up againſt the great <hi>mountain</hi> of <hi>Presbytery,</hi> as its Emulator and Rivall. This in a ſhort time hath ſo cloven it in ſunder, that it hath quite broken its hoped <hi>Monopoly</hi> of Church-government; and <hi>Independency</hi> having never had any Patent from any Chriſtian King or people heretofore, pleads a Patent (as doth Presbytery) from Chriſt Jeſus, which hath been, it ſeems, <hi>dormant</hi> and unexecuted theſe 1640 years. This ſome more groſſe and credulous ſpirits do ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily believe, though they never ſaw the <hi>Commiſsion.</hi> Only as the more acute and nimble <hi>Independents</hi> (beſides the more profound and ſolid <hi>Epiſcopalians</hi>) eagerly diſpute againſt the uſurped Authority of <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery,</hi> alledging that <hi>Claſsicall, Provinciall,</hi> and <hi>Nationall Presbyteries</hi> are to them much more <hi>Apocryphall</hi> than <hi>Deanes</hi> and <hi>Chapters, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops</hi> and <hi>Arch-biſhops</hi>; ſo do both of them no leſſe urge a pure No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty, beſides the fractions and parcellings of Government, againſt <hi>Independency,</hi> tokens of weakneſſe, imprudence and inconſiſtency in Government.</p>
               <p>Yet amidſt all this ſtickling, the <hi>puny</hi> of <hi>Independency</hi> (which enjoyed at firſt the ſmiles and cajolings of <hi>Presbytery,</hi> counting it an harmleſs and innocent Novelty, becauſe yet unarmed) grew up by ſtrange <hi>ſucceſſes</hi> and unexpected <hi>favours</hi> of power, to ſuch a <hi>ſtature, procerity</hi> and <hi>pertneſs,</hi> that it not onely now <hi>juſtles</hi> with Presbytery, but it makes it in many places glad to comply, yea to curry favour with, and to truckle under <hi>Independency</hi>; which challengeth <hi>Seniority</hi> before <hi>Presbytery,</hi> with much more probability than <hi>Presbytery</hi> can alledge any authority for its rejecting <hi>Catholick Epiſcopacy</hi>; it being more evident, that particular <hi>Congregations</hi> were firſt governed by one ſole <hi>Apoſtle, Pastor, Teacher, Biſhop,</hi> or <hi>Presbyter,</hi> preſent among them, than that many <hi>Presbyters</hi> ever governed the large and united Combinations of Chriſtian Congregations and Churches, without ſome one Apoſtle or eminent Biſhop, as <hi>chief Preſident</hi> among them: to which all Church-hiſtory conſents, without any one exception in all the world.</p>
               <p>Thus hath <hi>Independency,</hi> as a little, but tite, <hi>Pinnace,</hi> in a ſhort time got the wind of, and given a broad-ſide to <hi>Presbytery</hi>; which ſoon grew a <hi>ſlug,</hi> when once the <hi>North-wind</hi> ceaſed to fill its ſailes. Beſides this, <hi>Independency</hi> confining all its authority to a little bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and narrow compaſſe of one Congregation, hath a ſtroke or knack in it of greater <hi>popularity</hi> than <hi>Presbytery</hi> it ſelf; which having many heads and hands, ſoon grew terrible to great men as well as common people, threatning them not onely with one <hi>ſword</hi> or <hi>ſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter,</hi> but with the combined force of many <hi>Presbyters</hi> and <hi>Presbyteries,</hi> with appeales from one Conſiſtory to another, which looked like <hi>dew-rakes</hi> and <hi>harrowes,</hi> armed with ſo many teeth, that none great

               <p>Furthermore, the <hi>Magiſtratick genius</hi> and <hi>Emperiall ſpirits</hi> of this Nation (intending intirely to govern it, both in Civil and Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall reſpects) began in time to be better adviſed, and ſo to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware how they or the Nation fell under the Diſcipline of any <hi>Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy</hi> or <hi>Presbytery,</hi> whoſe Rods, nay <hi>Scorpions,</hi> caſtigated King <hi>James,</hi> during his pupillage or minority in <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſo ſeverely, that he could never forgive or forget their inſolency to his <hi>dying day,</hi> as he bitterly complains in his <hi>Baſilicon Doron</hi>; every <hi>petty Presbyter</hi> that had twenty Marks a year ſalary to live upon, fancying himſelf a Peer, not onely to the Lords, but to the Prince himſelf. This (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) many-headed <hi>Hydra</hi> of Government, King <hi>James</hi> did (and ſo might all wiſe men) ſee cauſe enough perfectly to abhorre both in Church and State; that it was not onely folly, but mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to buy the experience of it in <hi>England</hi> at the charge of our own miſeries, when we had our neighbours late examples ſo near us; that they were enough to have ſcared any wiſe men from ſuch an hare-brain'd and plebeian Presbytery, as King <hi>James</hi> and others de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe, ſpecially the Learned, Reverend and Impartiall Arch-biſhop of S. <hi>Andrews,</hi> who modeſtly ſets it forth in his late excellent Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the <hi>Church of Scotland,</hi> in its riſe, progreſſe, activity and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe: which was a Government popularly at firſt extorted from Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, Peers and Princes, by a company of minute Miniſters or petty Preachers, whoſe extravancies the wiſdome of King <hi>James</hi> after redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to a well-regulated Epiſcopacy; under which <hi>Scotland,</hi> as well as <hi>England,</hi> enjoyed, I believe, its beſt dayes.</p>
               <p>Thus when <hi>Presbytery</hi> had lopped <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> to the ſtumps in <hi>Engl.</hi> yea and thought it had grubbed it up by the Mattock and Pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ax of the <hi>Covenant</hi>; when it ſelf from a ſmall <hi>Shrub</hi> had ſet it ſelf up, began to take root, and to fill the land, againſt the will of the chief <hi>Cedar</hi> in the Forreſt, fancying it was now full of ſap, both of Divine and Humane Right, as if it were in high <hi>favour both with God and man</hi>; yet then it ſuddenly dwindled and looked ſo withered as if it had been Planet-ſtruck, or ſmitten with a ſharp Eaſt-wind, when indeed it was nothing elſe but the ſpirit of <hi>Independency</hi> and other Novelties, which like Palmer-worms or Caterpillers ſecretly bred in every corner of the land; and which have now alſo made their way even into <hi>Scotland</hi> it ſelf, ſometime the great Scene and Throne of Presbytery, now very tottering and much weakned, as to that part of affected ſoveraignty in Church-affairs.</p>
               <p>Nor is this young, tall, and ſeemingly ſo thrifty ſhoot of <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency</hi> (which is yet but ſlender, and more run up in height than ſpread in bulk) this is not ſo firmly fixed, that it cannot be removed, having little root in Scripture, or in the true reaſon of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:97412:210"/>
and Polity, nor more in any Church-patterns or practiſe of Antiquity; being like <hi>Jonah</hi>'s gourd, the child of a night, of yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, in compariſon of Primitive and Catholick <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> yea and a younger brother to <hi>Presbytery:</hi> which was but a modern ſhift uſed among ſome Reformed Churches, when they could not have as they deſired, Reforming and Reformed Biſhops to rule them; for elſe they had never (God knows) dreamed any thing of ſuch a Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery as ſhould tend to the extirpation of <hi>Apoſtolick Epiſcopacy.</hi> Nor is <hi>Independency</hi> with all its eaſie rootings and windings in our <hi>looſe</hi> and <hi>broken ſoyle</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> as yet far ſpread in the judgements of the moſt learned, grave and ſober perſons of <hi>England,</hi> looking upon it as incongruous in its Novelty, Feebleneſs, Factiouſneſs and popular temper, to the Genius and intereſt of the <hi>Engliſh people,</hi> who are never to be long or well ruled by thoſe whom they think their equals or inferiours.</p>
               <p>Even <hi>Independency</hi> it ſelf (which hath a pretty ſoft phraſe, and eaſier cords to bind people together in ſmall bodies) will in time find its weakneſſe in it ſelf, and betray it to others; whence will follow other variations from it, oppoſitions againſt it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of it. Who knows what way fierce <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> ambitious <hi>Millenaries,</hi> Seraphick <hi>Familiſts,</hi> rude <hi>Ranters,</hi> and ſilly <hi>Quakers</hi> wil af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect for their Church-government, or any other new and yet name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe Faction which may hereafter be <hi>ſpawned,</hi> more agreeable to the vulgar humour, which loves greater Latitudes, Indifferencies, Looſeneſſes and Cheapneſſes of Religion, both in Opinon and Practiſe, than learned and modeſt Independents will allow?</p>
               <p>Who ſees not how much the uncivil confidence and childiſh <hi>clownery</hi> of <hi>Quakers</hi> takes with the vulgar beyond any thing? while to ſet off their <hi>Enthuſiaſmes</hi> with a greater emphaſis, they affect a rude and levelling Converſation, with a familiarity of <hi>Thouing</hi> their betters and ſuperiours at every word, fancying great holineſſe in their ſimple and ſuperſtitious Yea and Nay, which are not the ſole and confined, but onely the ſhorteſt expreſſions of true and honeſt meanings; diſdaining to uſe any ſigns of Duty, common Courteſie, or Reſpect, which by the Laws of God and man are due to Parents, Equals or Superiours, according to the gentle, courteous and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble behaviour of all Chriſtians in all Countreys and Ages: yet do theſe ſort of new <hi>leaders</hi> pretend they come nearer to Jeſus Chriſt and to God, becauſe they have no reſpect of any perſons but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: and no doubt, in order further to relieve their Neceſſities and Obſcurities, theſe men would be content to have <hi>all things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> after the faſhion of primitive Charity, when the Churches neceſſities had an empire of love (not force) over particular Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans proprieties.</p>
               <p>Theſe and the like <hi>diſcriminations</hi> of parties in Religion, which are but lately grown out of the diſtempers of the <hi>Church of England</hi> (as wormes out of <hi>Job</hi>'s ſores or dunghill) have already not onely their Founders and Patrons (which muſt be almoſt <hi>deified</hi> by their
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:97412:211"/>
reſpective Diſciples) but they have alſo their <hi>grand Masters,</hi> Abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, Propagators, Followers and Champions; each challengeth to themſelves the titles of <hi>Chriſtians, Saints, godly people, the Church,</hi> &amp;c. not as good fellowes in a charitable community and Catholick correſpondency, but in a <hi>ſupercilious reſerve,</hi> almoſt excluding all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and <hi>unchurching</hi> them who are not juſt of their modes, who do not follow their colours, and are not ready to fight under their ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
               <p>To be ſure they all <hi>bandy</hi> againſt the poor <hi>Church of England,</hi> agreeing in this one <hi>Antipathy,</hi> how diſagreeing ſoever in other things; they ſtudy to divide her Unity, to break her ſolid Intireneſs, to enervate her Authority, to infatuate her Wiſdome, to weaken her Strength, to ſpoile her Patrimony, to deſtroy her very Being, and to render her Name odious; with great coyneſs and diſdain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſmiles looking upon any man or Miniſter that ſhall but ſpeak of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and counting him preſently as their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon enemy, if he profeſs a filial Regard, Duty, Love, Pity, Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and Subjection to it.</p>
               <p>Mean while, each of theſe <hi>Agitators</hi> for their ſeverall parties and intereſts, fancy to themſelves a great power <hi>reſident</hi> in them, a Divine Liberty and Authority derivable from them, to begin new Churches, to beget their own Fathers, to lead their Shepherds, to teach their Teachers, to ordain their Paſtors, to celebrate all holy Myſteries, to conſecrate Sacramentall Symbols: thus arrogating all that is Divine or Eccleſiaſtick to themſelves, in their ſeverall me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods and capacities. Sometimes the Paſtor begets a Flock for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, otherwhile a Flock begets a Paſtor to themſelves. It is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that they are ſo greedy and vigilant to ſhark what they can from the <hi>Church of England</hi> and its Miniſtry, which they cry down as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective, as contemptible, as uſeleſſe, as pernicious, as null; crying up their Novelties in opinion or practiſe beyond all that was ever uſed or known by the <hi>Church of England</hi> or any other ancient Church.</p>
               <p>Thus animated by confidence of themſelves, and inſtigated by contempt of others, ſpecially of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> they dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and zealouſly labour to make <hi>Proſelytes</hi> to their reſpective <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>; ſo to increaſe their numbers, then to enlarge their quarters: though their hands have hitherto been joyntly &amp; chiefly againſt the <hi>Church of Engl.</hi> yet they are ready, as occaſion ſhall ſerve, like <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> to be againſt one another, counting every one againſt them who is not for them.</p>
               <p>In fine, what doth any of them want, but Strength and Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to ſet up themſelves and their parties, to lift up their <hi>Standards,</hi> to diſplay their <hi>Enſigns,</hi> to inſcribe on their <hi>Flags</hi> of mutuall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiances the names of their ſeverall Factions, to advance their diſtinct, divided, and (now) diſcovered intereſts and deſignes, preſented under ſome ſpecious notion or name of <hi>Reformation,</hi> of Chriſts Kingdome, or Throne, or reign with them and by them, as
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:97412:211"/>
ſoon as they can begin, and as long as they can continue that <hi>ſacred Empire</hi>? which muſt, it ſeems, begin in <hi>England</hi>; for no where elſe in the world mens Heads are ſo buſie, mens Hearts ſo divided, their Wits ſo frantick, their Religion ſo fancifull, their Pride ſo inſolent, their Wills ſo wilfull, their Conſciences ſo looſe, their Charity ſo partiall, their Unity ſo broken, their Liberty ſo licentious, their Chriſtianity ſo ſelf-crucifying, their Reformations ſo rude, ſo ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, ſo ruinous, both to their common Mother, and to each other.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Church of England,</hi> there is not one of theſe fierce and flagrant <hi>Novellers</hi> but they look upon her with ſuch an eye as ungra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious children uſe to do upon their aged, weak, bed-rid and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſhed <hi>Mother,</hi> whom they think never like to get upon her legs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, much leſs to be able to aſſert her ſelf, to recover her Strength, Authority, Reputation and Eſtate, from their unnaturall and rapaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>invaſions</hi>; Her they have devoted to utter deſtruction, without any remaining ſparks of Honour, Love, or Pity for her; they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude her as condemned to perpetuall Deſolations; each of them reſolves to make their advantages by her Ruines, as ſome do by the Decayes of our Cathedrals: and this up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on no other quarrell, that I could ever ſee, but becauſe ſhe was, as <hi>much elder,</hi> ſo much <hi>wiſer</hi> and <hi>better</hi> than any, than all of them, as to all Learning, Wiſdome, Order, Gravity, Gifts, Graces, Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Conſtancy, Unity; theſe new modes of Religion and Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion conſiſting more in <hi>breaking</hi> than <hi>binding,</hi> in <hi>taking</hi> than <hi>giving,</hi> in <hi>pulling down</hi> than <hi>building</hi> any thing that might be a remarkable Inſtance and Monument, either of pious Magnificence, or munifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Piety.</p>
               <p>Poſſibly they may, out of <hi>principles</hi> of <hi>policy</hi> and <hi>ſelf-preſervation,</hi> keep ſome fair quarter to each other, and pretend a correſpondency, as brethren in <hi>diſcontent</hi> or <hi>iniquity,</hi> while they either are curbed by a potent and prudent hand, as to that civil predominancy and liberty they affect; or while they have ſome jealouſie of the <hi>Church of England</hi>'s recovery (their ſore and juſt enemy, in their eſteem, when indeed it is their trueſt friend, and leaſt their <hi>flatterer:</hi>) but when they fancy her to be irreparable, and each of themſelves in ſuch potency as can bear no competitor, they will certainly juſtle each other for more <hi>elbow-room.</hi> Their ſpirits are too big to be confined, when once blown up with confidence of numbers and ſucceſſes; neither their <hi>herds</hi> nor <hi>herdſmen</hi> can feed longer together: like <hi>Cocks</hi> of the <hi>game,</hi> when they have ſufficiently crowed over the <hi>Church of England,</hi> they will fight with one another. Their Principles are, and ſo will their Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces be, <hi>Mahometan</hi> as well as <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> rather to be active than paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, to follow the <hi>creſcent</hi> rather than bear the <hi>croſs.</hi> They are for rule and empire, rather than for Chriſtian patience and ſubjection: thoſe were ſuperſtitious, or neceſſitous, rather than religious Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and Practices of primitive ſillineſs, more than ſimplicity and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency (as they count them:) the <hi>Serpent</hi> in them will devour the

                  <hi>Dove,</hi> as ſoon as it growes great enough, that it may be no longer a creeping, but a flying fiery Serpent.</p>
               <p>Late experience too much gratifying, even to a glut and exceſſe, the various, licentious, factious and cruel Novelties of ſome men, hath thus far manifeſted the Folly, Ingratitude, Inordinateneſſe, Ambition and Madneſſe of their Principles, Practices and Spirits, that I ſee ſome men can never be content with moderate bleſſings in Church or State, nor ſatisfied with any thing, unleſſe they may be their own carvers: they are ſo eager to catch at the ſhadows of Novelty and whimſies of Reformation, that they are blindly zealous to loſe the ſubſtance of Religion, and deform the beſt Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the world; the iſſues of their Counſels are the iſſues of Death, and their paths tend either to Romiſh darkneſſe or Atheiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call indifferencies.</p>
               <p>From all which true obſervations of mens tempers and activities, preſages of future ſad events, I cannot but with grief of ſoul ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie (what many mens immoderate zeal is loth to believe) the wiſe obſervations of S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> and many others, who were ſet beyond juvenile heats and popular fervours;</p>
               <p>That Novelties in any well-ordered Church and Religion (though ſeemingly, yea and really, as to ſome degrees, for the better, yet) uſually perturb the Church and State of Religion more than they profit them.<note place="margin">Magis perturbat novitas, quàm prodeſt veritas.</note> No private mens reformings end without their greater deformities; if perhaps they adde to the Purity and Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, they take as much away from the Charity and Unity of Religion. That Paſſion commonly darkens and ſullies more than their pretenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Piety do poliſh or brighten Religion. That prepoſterous Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers inſtead of <hi>ſnuffing</hi> the <hi>lamps</hi> of the Temple, are prone to put them quite out: eſpecially when the ignorance and inſolence of <hi>Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> undertake to ſet the <hi>Ark of God</hi> upon their Cart,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 6.10.</note> to draw it with Beaſts, and drive it with their whips and whiſtlings, though they whiſtle to the tune of a Pſalm; yet Religion alwayes <hi>totters,</hi> is oft overthrown by them, being never ſafe but when it is, as the Ark ought to have been, carried upon the ſhoulders of able <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Levites,</hi> ſuch Biſhops and Presbyters as ought to bear it up, and to whoſe care that ſacred <hi>depoſitum</hi> is chiefly committed by Chriſt and the Apoſtles. Nor hath the learned and godly <hi>Clergy</hi> in <hi>England</hi> ever been ſo weak and unworthy, as to want either ability or will, Sufficiency or Authority, to do this ſervice to God and his Church; however now they are ſo debaſed, diſcouraged, and almoſt beaten out of the <hi>Sanctuary.</hi> Reformations of Religion ever prove either abortive or misſhapen, when they are either begotten or brought forth by Miniſters <hi>factiouſneſſe</hi> or peoples <hi>fury</hi>: tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuating and irregular wayes of reforming any Church do but cut up and ſo kill the <hi>mother,</hi> in hope to ſave that Baſtard-child, which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving neither due form nor legitimation deſerves no long life.</p>
               <p>We ſee by too wofull experiences and infinite expences of blood, that <hi>Churches,</hi> when in ſome things decayed, are eaſier mended in

Fancy than in effect, in the project than performance; That this <hi>Church-work</hi> requires not onely proper workmen and skilfull <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts,</hi> but tender hands and cautious fingers; That where the <hi>Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialls,</hi> Vitals and Fundamentalls of Religion in any Church, are good as to true doctrine, ſaving faith, holy inſtitutions, and honeſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls, the prudentialls and ornamentalls cannot but be commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, if they be tolerable; That the peace and ſafety of a ſetled Church ought not to be indangered for circumſtances; That it is a dangerous practice of <hi>Empiricks,</hi> to give able and otherwiſe healthfull bodies uncorrected <hi>Quick-ſilver,</hi> which ſhall kill them outright, in order to kill ſome little itch or tetter upon them, whoſe breaking forth to the circumference or outward habit of the body is a good effect of an ill cauſe, a ſign of firmer health in the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler and more retired parts.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Hitherto I have powred <hi>Wine</hi> into the <hi>wounds</hi> of this Church, not ſo much <hi>ſuppling</hi> as ſearching them, by an honeſt ſeverity: The <hi>bruiſes</hi> and <hi>putrified ſores,</hi> which are all over the body of our <hi>reformed Religion,</hi> were not capable of Oyles and <hi>Balſames,</hi> of ſofter and ſweeter applications, till the putid and painfull <hi>ulcerations</hi> were firſt opened, the <hi>cores</hi> of them diſcovered, and the <hi>pus</hi> or <hi>ſanies</hi> of them let out; which to conceal and ſmother by gentle, but unſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere ſalves, by civil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but cruel plaiſters (rather palliating our miſeries, than healing our maladies) were a method of ſo great baſeneſſe and unworthineſſe in me, as might for ever juſtly deprive me of the honour of <hi>faithfulneſſe</hi> to God, to this Church, to true Religion, to my Country, to my own and to your ſoules. I know the freedom of my pen hitherto, like the ſharpneſſe of a <hi>Lancet</hi> or <hi>probe,</hi> may be prone to offend on all ſides: few men are ſo humble as not to find fault with thoſe that tell them of their faults: thoſe are commonly

Yet ſince my aymes are in this writing upon, or rather <hi>ripping</hi> up the <hi>bilious inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations</hi> of Religion, not to ſpare my own diſorders, or theirs with whom I may ſeem moſt to ſymbolize in my opinion and practice, I hope no good man, great or ſmall, will be cauſeleſly offended with the juſt <hi>inciſions,</hi> or <hi>ſcarrifyings</hi> I have made; which as the gangre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous neceſſity of our maladies (otherwiſe deſperate and incurable) have compelled me to, ſo the pious, peaceable and charitable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of my ſoul, inorder to a common and publick good, will then beſt excuſe them, when my Readers ſhall perceive with how liberall an hand and free an heart, I do in this <hi>fourth Book</hi> impart the beſt of my thoughts, my humbleſt ſuggeſtions, faithfulleſt counſels, and tendereſt cares, in order to their happineſſe, no leſſe then my own, who am infinitely ſolicitous, and paſſionately concerned what becomes of the <hi>Ark</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> of the true reformed Chriſtian Religion in <hi>England,</hi> jealous leſt the Philiſtines take it, and with it the <hi>glory</hi> of <hi>our Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I know it may be retorted upon me, That nothing is eaſier than to complain of others, nothing harder than to mend ones ſelf; That <hi>cenſors</hi> of Epidemick diſorders make themſelves publick <hi>enemies,</hi> and ſubject to oſtraciſme on all ſides; That both <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>people,</hi> Magiſtrates and ſubjects, are prone to interpret ſuch repreſentations for reproches of them, as if they were defective in their counſels and cares of Religion; alſo as arrogancies in any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate man, to ſeem either more ſenſible of, or more ſolicitous for, or more conſultive in order to thoſe great and publick concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which no wiſe men can faile to diſcern, no good man forbear to remedy, as far as is in his power; That it is not ſo much an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick, as an inordinate charity, or indiſcreet zeal, for any man to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſe his own tranquillity, by importuning others to be better than they like to be, or to do better than the diſtemper of times will give them leave; that neither Magiſtrates nor Miniſters are to be blamed or traduced as defective in their duties, becauſe they are not preſently maſters of peoples petulancies, nor can ſuddenly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand that great <hi>Ship</hi> to ſteere about, and obey the <hi>Rudder</hi> of Reaſon and Religion, which hath lately been carryed violently away, as by the ſway of its own ponderous bulk, ſo by the fierceneſſe of mighty and contrary winds, alſo by the <hi>fatality</hi> of thoſe ſecret, but irreſiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>tides</hi> of Providence, when <hi>Divine Juſtice</hi> and vengeance hath ſtruck in with humane paſſions and tranſgreſſions, at once to <hi>uſe</hi> them and to <hi>puniſh</hi> them.</p>
               <p>I am ſo far from <hi>reproching</hi> any that are in power, and thoſe leaſt who are in greateſt place, that (in earneſt) I pity them for what they cannot act, as effectually, as I charitably preſume they ſoberly deſign and deſire in reſpect of that Chriſtian unity and harmony of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which every wiſe and good man muſt needs be unfeignedly am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious

to enjoy and promote. The obſtructions of which ariſe, not from depraved and dangerous <hi>State-policies,</hi> (as ſome ſuſpect) pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely fomenting <hi>Diviſions</hi> in <hi>Religion,</hi> (which no prudent Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour but ſees cauſe to feare, and will ſtudy to avoid) but from thoſe <hi>head-ſtrong</hi> furies and animoſities, which accompany the vulgar, when once (like <hi>Stone-horſes</hi> got looſe from their ſtalls, traice, and bridles) they find themſelves at ſuch a liberty, as is beyond the ſwitch or ſpur, the curb or whip of their riders and governours; whoſe riotous and boyſterous courſes are hardly to be ſtopped, till they have either tired, or intangled, or hurt, or confounded and overthrown themſelves and others; till which time, it is not ſafe for their <hi>Keepers</hi> to come too neer their <hi>wanton heels,</hi> or forcibly to reduce them, like wild Aſſes and Unicorns, to their wonted ſtations and cribs. Nor is (perhaps) the <hi>dilatory cautiouſneſſe</hi> of wiſe men herein to be blamed ſo much as commended, while they <hi>temporize</hi> for ſome time with the <hi>Populacy,</hi> till experience of their own folly, diſorders, dangers and miſeries, hath taught them how much ſafer they are under other mens orderly reſtraints and government, than their own licentious choice and freedoms, as in Civil, ſo in Religious Concernments.</p>
               <p>I believe the mutuall feuds, jealouſies, and animoſities in <hi>England</hi> among the divided Factions in Religion, have hitherto been ſo eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bent to advance themſelves, and to depreſſe their rivalls, that it hath been a work of great Prudence, no leſſe than Policy, ſo far to balance them, till Time had diſcovered to them their common de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formities and dangers, by their diſagreements and defeats; beſides the generall decay and mutuall debaſing of what each highly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to advance, <hi>The Reformed Religion.</hi>

               <p>Nor doe I doubt, but thoſe <hi>Powers</hi> and <hi>Counſels,</hi> under which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence hath at preſent ſubjected our Civil and Eccleſiaſtick Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, will ſo far with favour interpret my endeavours, and accept of them, as they muſt needs appear to all ſober men, onely ſtudious to ſerve the publick good, and not to advance any private intereſt or particular party in Religion. Nor ſhall I be taxed (I hope) for ſelf-conceited and too preſumptuous, as if I ſuppoſed all men to be blind or <hi>dim-ſighted</hi> beſides my ſelfe, while I offer them this <hi>Collyrium,</hi> or <hi>Eye-ſalve:</hi> No, I know my own obſcurity, tenuity, and infirmity. Nor doe I here offer my own private ſenſe ſo much, as the generall votes, prayers, hopes and expectations of all moderate and impartial men, ſo far as I have been able to obſerve the <hi>pulſe</hi> of their hearts, and deſires of their ſoules: yea many ſuch as have heretofore highly engaged for or againſt any faction, during the tranſports of their firſt <hi>fits</hi> and <hi>Paroxyſmes,</hi> even theſe, being grown (now) much cooler and better compoſed in their ſpirits, doe ſeem to breathe after nothing ſo earneſtly, as ſome ſuch happy <hi>compoſure</hi> of our religious diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as may moſt advance the generall intereſts of the Chriſtian and Reformed Religion againſt the common enemies of both; and therein ſo ſecure their reſpective and particular priviledges, or inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent

               <p>What good Chriſtian, that liſts not to be Atheiſtically profane, what honeſt <hi>Protestant,</hi> that cannot comply with the <hi>Roman</hi> errors and inſolencies, doth not deplore the ſcratches, the wounds, the blood-ſheds, the deformities, the <hi>decayes,</hi> the deaths, which the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion hath lately ſuffered here in <hi>England?</hi> Who is ſo brain-ſick or barbarous, as not to ſee that our common ſafety is in our religious unity? that our civill honour and happineſſe cannot be ſecure, untill eſtabliſhed upon the pillars of Chriſtian purity and <hi>har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony?</hi> To this mark I preſſe thus hard; at this deſign I earneſtly drive; this is the prize I ayme at, during the remaine of my ſhort race in this world: as I know I do not run alone, ſo I hope I ſhall not <hi>run in vain,</hi> but being aſſiſted with Gods gracious Spirit, which is full of meekneſſe and wiſdome, I truſt I ſhall enjoy the concurrent ſuffrages, good wills and prayers of all thoſe that wiſh the proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of true <hi>Religion</hi> and theſe <hi>Britiſh</hi> Nations.</p>
               <p>To poure in the <hi>balm</hi> of <hi>Gilead</hi> with the more order into the wounds of this Church and its Reformed Religion, I ſhall <hi>firſt</hi> ſet forth the confeſſed difficulty of the work, I mean the cloſing and healing of Religious breaches in any Church or Nation, where once differences are exaſperated; and not onely mens opinions and paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but their civill intereſts and ſecular deſigns ſeem engaged.</p>

               <p>The difficulty here of winning people from the error of their wayes, of redeeming and overcoming them with a <hi>gentle conqueſt,</hi> when once their luſts, errors and ignorances have bound them as <hi>Captives</hi> with the chains of their opinions, is ſo great, that, as it muſt not diſcourage, but rather <hi>whet</hi> the edge of pious and charitable induſtry in Magiſtrates and Miniſters, ſo it will exerciſe all their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt policies, their Chriſtian prudence, and charitable patience; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving herein to contend not onely with the <hi>pragmatick</hi> follies of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and a kind of <hi>variable</hi> wantonneſſe or madneſſe, but alſo their <hi>rudeneſſes</hi> and reproches, their ingratitudes and contempts, their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacings and aſſaſſinations, who oft meditate even the death of thoſe, as greateſt tyrants and perſecutors, that will not let them live at what rate and riot of <hi>Religion</hi> they liſt.</p>

               <p>Here the torrent of <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s rougher eloquence, the ſweeter fluencie of St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s zealous candour, the invincible ſinews of <hi>Athanaſius</hi> his ſtyle and reſolution, the liquid gold of St. <hi>Chryſoſtom's</hi> tongue and pen, the gentle dews and plentifull ſhowrs of St. <hi>Auſtins</hi> holy and humble ſoul, the ſtrong tides, vehement ſtorms of St. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom's</hi> mighty <hi>genius,</hi> which proſtrates all it cannot carry with it; Here the <hi>Gregories</hi> and <hi>Baſils, Irenaeus, Hilary, Optatus,</hi> and all other Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies of old, (who were <hi>Champions</hi> for the Truth, and contended <hi>earneſtly</hi> for the faith once <hi>delivered,</hi> and the unity of the true <hi>Church</hi> of Chriſt, againſt all oppoſers and factious ſeducers) uſed all religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous force, and pious engins, that were proper to apply to the <hi>reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution</hi> of Religion, and reparation of the Church, when it was either ſcattered and perſecuted by Infidels, or defamed and divided by Schiſmaticks, or poiſoned and corrupted by <hi>Hereticks.</hi> Nor were they more induſtrious to uſe the power of <hi>arguments</hi> in their own Sermons and diſputations, than cautious how they ſtirred up the <hi>ſpirits</hi> of <hi>Princes</hi> to apply the power of <hi>Armes</hi> in the matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, further then for its neceſſary defence from the pragmatick petulancies and reall inſolencies of <hi>Manichees, Arrians, Circumcellians, Donatiſts,</hi> and <hi>others,</hi> whoſe hands they thought might by ſuch me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods be juſtly curbed and reſiſted; although their hearts were not to be ſo ſoftned, nor their errors ſo confuted.</p>
               <p>Indeed the <hi>reparations</hi> of Religion, and the <hi>reſtauration</hi> of any lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed or decayed Church, is a work not to be done by ſudden <hi>pulls,</hi> meerly by ropes and cables: unſeaſonable applications of violent and coercive means are prone to harden mens hearts, to exaſperate their ſpirits, and to make them both more <hi>refractory</hi> and pertinacious in their religious errors, extravagancies and affectations. The work is much more eaſie and proper to be effected by ſuch diſcreet and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <hi>counterpoiſings</hi> of Reaſon and Religion, of Grace and Virtue, of Wiſdome and Charity, in worthy Magiſtrates and Miniſters, as may in time, by inſenſible degrees, as it were <hi>out-weigh</hi> thoſe ſad and heavy depreſſions which are brought in and maintained by peoples ſiniſter paſſions, petulancies, prejudices, or ſuperſtitions, to the <hi>ſplit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> of any Church, and ſinking of Religion; theſe muſt be <hi>counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poiſed</hi> by that gravity, ſanctity, majeſty, ſolemnity, due authority, juſt incouragement, and honeſt advantages, which pious <hi>Princes</hi> and godly <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> cheerfully and liberally afford to the orderly Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers and ſober Profeſſors of true Religion; forbidding in the firſt place any men to make a prey or ſpoyl of the Church in any kind,
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:97412:216"/>
or to advance any ſecular <hi>emoluments</hi> by their ſchiſmatick and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious extravagancies. Few men ever ſeparate from, or fight againſt the <hi>Church,</hi> or true Religion, but as Soldiers of Fortune, in hope to <hi>plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> them. Nor is it the honour ſo much, as the profit of the victory, that vulgar <hi>ſpirits</hi> aime at, when they contend againſt the <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Paſtors,</hi> the honour, order &amp; ſtability of any Church and its Miniſters.</p>
               <p>Beſides this firſt difficulty, in reſtoring any ſhattered Church and Religion, which proceeds from the ruder paſſions and impatiencies of the <hi>licentious</hi> vulgar, Wiſe men have further to contend with thoſe tempers in common people, which are moſt humane, ſoft, and commendable in them; that is, their pitties and <hi>compaſsions,</hi> which make them prone to <hi>ſympathize</hi> with any perſons or <hi>opinions,</hi> never ſo <hi>bad</hi> and <hi>baſe,</hi> when once they ſee them violently oppreſſed, and, as they ſuppoſe, perſecuted for that which they profeſſe as their <hi>Religion,</hi> which they are ready to judge leſſe <hi>confutable</hi> by Scripture and right reaſon, when they ſee it ſet upon by Swords and Piſtols, by Fire and Faggot, by <hi>Priſons</hi> and <hi>Confiſcations.</hi> People are ready to oppoſe all <hi>force</hi> with <hi>pitty,</hi> to adopt any opinion that they ſee rather puniſhed than convinced; whom they cannot help with their hands, they relieve with their hearts, their prayers and tears; which, by ſoftning mens minds, make an eaſie way for any <hi>error</hi> or <hi>hereſie</hi> to inſinuate into their <hi>conſciences,</hi> though recommended by nothing but the <hi>patience</hi> or <hi>pertinacy</hi> of the ſufferers for it. Hence ſome wiſe and calmer States-men as well as Church-men, blamed the ſeverity of burning uſed in Q. <hi>Eliz.</hi> dayes againſt ſome Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts; and once in King <hi>James</hi> his reign, againſt an impudent <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian,</hi> (for which Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> and the <hi>Geneva</hi> Conſiſtory had given him an example in <hi>Servetus</hi>:) In whoſe aſhes (as King <hi>James</hi> ſaid) while men rake to find a Martyrly patience, they oft find an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall pravity, and ſuch damnable, yet deſperate errors, as he after thought were better ſmothered by <hi>priſons</hi> or <hi>baniſhment,</hi> than expoſed to light by thoſe horrid fires which burn men alive, or ſubject them to ſuch remarkable ſufferings, as ſtigmatize their <hi>errors</hi> on the hearts of many their <hi>pittifull ſpectators.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How have we found even the <hi>dry trees</hi> of <hi>Pillories</hi> in the laſt Kings dayes, ſo fruitfull in popular compaſſions, that the ſuppoſed petulant and intemperate ſpirits of ſome men, who ſuffered on them, made thouſands adhere to them; who otherwayes would, in calmer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, have utterly abhorred their folly and faction, their popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity and arrogancy? Hence many wretched men, that deſpaire by other means to be remarkable or infamouſly famous, affect to be <hi>ſufferers</hi>; ambitious by their ſeeming <hi>Martyrdoms</hi> to gain reputation to their rotten, erroneous, and ſeditious opinions.</p>
               <p>Down-right <hi>force</hi> is indeed very effectuall to doe not onely great executions upon the outward man, but to make ſtrong <hi>confutations,</hi> and ſeeming <hi>converſions,</hi> upon mens opinions and perſwaſions in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of civill right and juſtice: For vulgar minds are loth to <hi>look</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond outward events, and willingly reſolve their <hi>Conſciences</hi> into
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:97412:217"/>
                  <hi>Providences</hi>; prone to conclude, that all is juſt and righteous, that is potent and proſperous. They eaſily fancy with themſelves, and flatter others, that thoſe have the better <hi>cauſe,</hi> who have the better end of the <hi>ſtaffe.</hi> True Religion (indeed) exactly regards the Word of God, and the intrinſick meaſures, even in Civil affairs, of Truth and Juſtice. But eaſier <hi>Superſtition</hi> dotes on the <hi>Superficies</hi> or <hi>Idol of Succeſſe,</hi> counting all is well, when the event is not ill; willingly ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering themſelves to be carryed down that ſtream, where prevalent power carries dominion with it, and commands ſubjection to it, (which prudent complyance with the outward man ſeems not onely veniall and tolerable in common people, but commendable even in all ſober men, as to civill and ſecular affairs, while nothing inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feres with thoſe inward moralls, nor contradicts thoſe neceſſary Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Chriſtian faith, which are indiſpenſible at all times, and on all occaſions to be believed, aſſerted and obeyed.</p>
               <p>But in <hi>matters of Religion,</hi> common people are not generally ſo tame, nor ſo ſoon <hi>cowed</hi> or <hi>over-awed</hi> by meer force and <hi>club-law:</hi> by which methods the Duke <hi>D' Alva</hi> loſt his Maſter the King of <hi>Spain</hi> thoſe fair Provinces of the <hi>Low-countries.</hi> For beſides their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall <hi>restiveneſſe, ſtubbornneſſe</hi> and <hi>doggedneſſe,</hi> they are mightily heightned in theſe tempers and humours by the imagination of zeal, and reſolutions of neceſſary perſeverance in any way that they have choſen for their Religion, though it be never ſo extravagant, yea ridiculous; eſpecially if bare force be applyed to remove them, then they are as ponderous as the congealed Mountains, or Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern heaps of Ice, which no Engines can remove; but the warmer <hi>Sun</hi> will ſecretly thaw, and eaſily melt them, ſo that they ſhall of <hi>themſelves</hi> diſſolve and fall aſunder.</p>
               <p>It is obvious to all men to hold and graſp that faſteſt, which any ſeeks to wreſt or extort from them; and all ſpectators of ſuch <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tests,</hi> are ready to judge, that that ſide either wants, or diſtruſts its rationall and perſwaſive <hi>power</hi> (which is moſt proper to be applyed to the minds and conſciences of men, in <hi>matters of Religion</hi>) when they ſee much uſe is made of perſecutive and compelling power; which is rather brutiſh than <hi>humane:</hi> ſuch as <hi>Balaams</hi> paſſion uſed towards his <hi>Aſſe</hi>;<note place="margin">Numb. 22.22.</note> but it was not uſed by the <hi>Angel</hi> toward <hi>Balaam,</hi> who being the more perverſe and refractory beaſt of the two, yet the <hi>Angel</hi> by Gods commiſſion onely reaſons, argues, and perſwades with him, while he with fury ſmites his <hi>Aſſe</hi> once and again. Not onely Piety and Chriſtian Charity, but common Reaſon and Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity teach all good-natur'd people to <hi>frown</hi> upon force, and look ſadly upon ſufferers, upon any Religious account, unleſſe (as <hi>Hacket</hi> and his complices) where mens blaſphemous opinions and riotous actions, like <hi>mad-mens,</hi> are ſuch, that they break all thoſe <hi>bounds</hi> which Morality, Modeſty, Civil Juſtice, Publique Peace, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of eſtabliſhed Religion, and the Reverence of the Dive in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, do preſcribe to all men, no leſſe than to all Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>State-<hi>breaches,</hi> or Civill fractures, like fleſh-wounds, will in time be
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:97412:217"/>
healed by a kind of <hi>weapon-ſalve:</hi> I mean, that <hi>Soveraign power</hi> of the Sword, which prevails, wil in time either depreſſe or extirpate contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry factions; either ſo over-awing them by fears, or winning them by rewards, that they will with patience and prudence rather embrace a ſafe and quiet <hi>ſubjection,</hi> than adventure upon dangerous and impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable <hi>commotions.</hi> But the violent ſtrokes made againſt mens Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, reach even their very hearts; n defence of which all their ſpirits ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther together, reſolving (if they have any courage or ſincerity) ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to die, than deny or deſert what they at preſent count their <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The caſting of good ſtore of water, or bloud, upon civill <hi>confla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grations,</hi> will, at laſt, quench them; and prevalent power will make a ſhift to build it ſelf new <hi>manſions</hi> or <hi>palaces,</hi> out of thoſe ruinous ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials which were much burnt and waſted, but not quite conſumed, by thoſe fires. But <hi>religious burnings,</hi> like the flames of <hi>jealouſie,</hi> are <hi>contumacious,</hi> riſing like <hi>wild-fire</hi> moſt violently againſt all means that are uſed ſuddenly and forcibly to ſmother and extinguiſh them. Many of all ſorts of Religions have choſen rather to be burnt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, than to have their opinions quenched, and their Religion <hi>ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed</hi>; eſpecially if they can have the glory to be <hi>Champions</hi> for a ſide, or Patrons of a party, and have many <hi>ſpectators</hi> or <hi>ſectators</hi> to be their applauders.</p>
               <p>Putid <hi>humors</hi> and noxious <hi>ulcers</hi> once broken out, and far ſpread in any Nation, (as now in <hi>England</hi>) upon the account of <hi>Religion,</hi> (like Saint <hi>Anthonies</hi> fire, or ſharp <hi>Eriſipylas</hi>) are ſafeſt healed by <hi>lenitive purgations,</hi> rather than cold <hi>applications outwardly. Factions</hi> in Religion, like <hi>Fiſtula's</hi> or <hi>running ſores</hi> in foule bodies, are in leaſt pain and danger, when they have ſome vent allowed them, by which the <hi>venemous humours</hi> may leiſurely ſpend themſelves; and thoſe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilent opinions which carry with them pernicious practices, ſo <hi>drain</hi> away, as moſt keeps them from recoyling upon the head, heart, or other noble parts.</p>
               <p>All ſudden skinning over, or cloſing of the <hi>orifices,</hi> by which thoſe ſharp humours are obſtructed, but not purged, is very dangerous and diffuſive of the miſchief, making the ſource of the malignity to flow higher, if it be not drawn away by ſuch gentle <hi>dieticks,</hi> or healing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, as ſtrengthning the ſound parts, aſſiſting the weak and purging the diſaffected, enables them by little and little to caſt out what ever was unſound in them, and noxious to them.</p>
               <p>Nothing makes the <hi>neſtitutions</hi> of true, but decayed and divided Religion, more difficult in any Nation, than thoſe mutuall corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and paſſions, thoſe animoſities and tranſports which diſaffect both the People as Patients, and many times the Magiſtrates and Miniſters as Phyſitians. And nothing renders that work more facile and <hi>feiſable,</hi> than that calmneſſe, <hi>moderation</hi> and <hi>temper,</hi> which ought alwayes to be in <hi>Phyſitians,</hi> whatever violent fits and diſtempers ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the Patients. Governours in Church and State muſt ever expect ſuch diſtempers in peoples minds, eſpecially when they are
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:97412:218"/>
touched upon the tender place of their Religion, with which mens conſciences ſeem ſo vehemently to ſympathize, that Reformers had need carefully to furniſh themſelves with ſuch <hi>meekneſſe of wiſdome,</hi> as is the <hi>beſt antidote</hi> for their own ſecurity, and againſt the others malady.</p>
               <p>Then there will be hopes of <hi>healing</hi> in <hi>Religion,</hi> not when <hi>Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> or <hi>indulgence</hi> is granted to all opinions and profeſſions, which liſt to <hi>chriſten</hi> themſelves; but when ſuch a publick way of ſolid and ſincere <hi>Religion,</hi> both as to doctrine and practice, is ſeriouſly deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, duly prepared, publiquely agreed upon, and ſolemnly eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as carryes with it moſt of cleare <hi>Scripture</hi>-precept, and Saintly pattern, in faith and manners, in vertues and graces, in duties and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions, in order and authority, in honeſty and charity, with the greateſt uprightneſſe and impartiality towards God and man.</p>
               <p>However <hi>Epidemick contagions</hi> may for a time be permitted ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of neceſſary <hi>connivence,</hi> that they may more freely breathe out themſelves; yet this great remedy and ſoveraign medicine in due time ought to be applyed, which conſiſts in the owning and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſuch a <hi>Religion</hi> as hath in it whatever is holy, neceſſary, uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, comely, and commendable in any of the pretending parties. This once approved, and fixed by grave counſell, and publique ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of all Eſtates, as the <hi>Standard</hi> of the publique profeſſion and practice of Religion; being alſo aſſerted and propagated by Preachers of moſt <hi>indiſputable authority,</hi> of pregnanteſt <hi>abilities,</hi> and of moſt <hi>exemplary lives,</hi> orderly and unanimouſly agreeing among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, hereby meriting and enjoying the <hi>double honour</hi> of publique reſpect and maintenance; theſe gentle, rationall, and wholſome <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods</hi> of Religion, will certainly in a few years, by Gods bleſſing, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>drein,</hi> or drive out, by ſecret and gentle workings, all thoſe peſtilent diſtempers in Religion, which vulgar minds, by a corrupted <hi>Liberty,</hi> as by a licentious and foule diet, have contracted, to the great diſorder and deformity of any Church or Nation profeſſing Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p>For in a ſhort time, ſuch as are truly <hi>conſciencious,</hi> by the fear of God, and love of true Religion, will ceaſe to be either pertinacious, or contentious, or factious, or inconſtant, when they are convinced of ſo excellent a <hi>way,</hi> as they cannot but conclude to be ſafe; ſince it is holy and true, ſober and ſetled, comely and charitable. Others that are meer <hi>Politicians</hi> in Religion, either formall <hi>Phariſees,</hi> or falſe <hi>hypocrites,</hi> or fawning <hi>Paraſites,</hi> ready to change and comply with any party and perſwaſion, in order to ſecular advantages, even theſe will ſoon give over their factious agitations, their pragmatick ſticklings, and popular ſidings and ſhiftings in Religion, when once they find which way the <hi>wind</hi> or ſtream of publique favour and civill intereſt doe drive. The Mils of Factions in Religion will ſoon give over their motions, when once they perceive no griſt of Profit, or ſtream of Preferment, or breath of vulgar Applauſe is brought in to them.</p>
               <p>There is no wonder to be made at thoſe late ſad and mad <hi>extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancies,</hi>
                  <pb n="399" facs="tcp:97412:218"/>
which of later yeares have prevailed againſt the <hi>reformed Religion</hi> once ſetled in <hi>England</hi>; while the Majeſty and Honour of this Church and State, the ſanctity of our Lawes, Civil and Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick, the ſolemnity of Gods publick worſhip and ſervice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and maintenance of his Miniſters, have all been (through our civil broyles and tumults) unhappily expoſed to infinite arrogancies, ſpoiles, contempts, and inſolencies, even of common people; while they ſaw ſo many priſons and bonds, ſo many ſequeſtrations and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencings, ſo many deaths and dangers, attend not onely the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> but the <hi>Presbyters,</hi> the chief Preachers and prime Profeſſors on all ſides of that reformed Religion which was eſtabliſhed in <hi>England.</hi> No wonder, if while the populacy ſee great Preachers and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors caſt ſo much dirt, and ſpit in each others faces; while they ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect that all piety, honeſty and Chriſtian charity, are made to truckle under State-<hi>Policies,</hi> and bend to <hi>worldly</hi> intereſts; no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if the vulgar deſperately leap into the Sea of confuſion and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, out of that ſhip which they ſaw not onely ſo leaky and crazy, that it was almoſt ſunk, but ſo ſet on fire, that they deſpaired to quench it: No wonder if they venture upon either inventing what new wayes of Religion they liſt to fancy, or deſpiſing all wonted publick formes and profeſſions; ſince they think themſelves not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incouraged, but in a ſort exemplarily commanded, and almoſt compelled to caſt off with ſcorn that <hi>Reformed Profeſsion</hi> of Chriſtian Religion, which had ſo great a Name of Wiſdome, Law, Honour and Holineſſe, Glory and Happineſſe, as that had which was eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in the <hi>Church of England,</hi> (never to be <hi>mended,</hi> as to the main and ſubſtantials of Religion, in Doctrine, Worſhip, Diſcipline, Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Government; however in ſome circumſtantials, ſomething might poſſibly be altered, or added, by the ſober counſels of wife and peaceable men, who had both ability and autority for ſuch a work.)</p>
               <p>Whoſe great difficulty now is chiefly heightned by that <hi>popular froth</hi> and vanity, thoſe animoſities, and arrogancies, thoſe infinite va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riations and confuſions, with which vulgar fury and paſſions have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, the <hi>face</hi> divided the <hi>body,</hi> yea almoſt devoured every joynt and limb of Chiriſtan and reformed Religion in <hi>England.</hi>

               <p>This check made <hi>Presbytery</hi> much more tame and tractable than it was wont to be, when it firſt <hi>whetted its tuſhes</hi> ſo ſharply, and <hi>briſled</hi> ſo fiercely againſt all <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> root and branch, hoofes and hornes; no regulation, no remiſſion, no moderation, no merit of ſo many Godly, Learned, Moderate, yea Martyrly Biſhops, heretofore, and even then in <hi>England</hi> would ſerve the <hi>turn.</hi> After all this trouble, the more grave and ſober ſort even of thoſe Presbyterian and Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent Miniſters are brought (as we ſee) into no ſmall ſtraits, and reduced to this great <hi>Dilemma</hi> of <hi>policy,</hi> whether they ſhould chooſe to put their heads again under the <hi>Biſhops</hi> hands, or under the common peoples feet; whether it be more for the honor of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry to be ſubordinate to grave and worthy <hi>Biſhops,</hi> as Learned Moderators, <hi>Preſidentiall Fathers,</hi> and elder <hi>Brothers,</hi> or to be thus everlaſtingly haunted with evill and unclean Spirits, to be thus hampered with the giddy and ungratefull vulgar, who are very pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulant and <hi>ſaucy companions,</hi> very ſoure and inſolent maſters.</p>

               <p>From theſe <hi>holy confinements</hi> when once Chriſtians come to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide as to their Religion, they ſoon fall to defie, to deſtroy, yea to damne one another: Every party hath ſuch high <hi>paroxyſmes</hi> of <hi>zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous hopes</hi> and <hi>preſumptions</hi> for their way, that they preſently <hi>aſcend Gods Throne,</hi> and Chriſts <hi>Tribunall,</hi> ſeverely judging all men but <hi>themſelves:</hi> which <hi>judiciall</hi> and uncharitable <hi>arrogancies</hi> have (as we ſee) at this day, not onely in <hi>England,</hi> but in all the <hi>Chriſtian world,</hi> ſo filled and inflamed mens minds with cruell <hi>counter-curſes</hi> and angry <hi>Anathema</hi>'s againſt each other, that if Gods <hi>last doome</hi> ſhould <hi>echo</hi> after the <hi>clamours</hi> and cenſures of <hi>Chriſtians paſsions,</hi> we muſt all be damned, every <hi>mothers child</hi> of us, notwithſtanding that we all profeſſe to believe and ſerve the ſame God and Saviour.

               <p>No Chriſtian <hi>State</hi> or <hi>Church</hi> can be too vigilant or unſecure in this point, the ſuppreſſing and preventing of all religious <hi>fewds</hi> and <hi>diſturbances,</hi> whoſe firſt <hi>conception</hi> commonly ſprings from, either ſome odde ſtroke in the heads, or ſome putid humors in mens hearts, wherein long peace and plenty makes men either <hi>wantonly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractory</hi> againſt other mens forms and opinions, or pertinaciouſly zealous for their own inventions, many times not more ſupercili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly than unſeaſonably; every one being ſo loth to ſweep away the cobwebs they or others have made, either late or long ſince, that

               <p>For this <hi>Good</hi> the wiſe <hi>God</hi> hath brought out of the evill of our follies and miſeries, that the ſad conſequences (poſſibly not intended by many, but) purſuing our late <hi>deviations</hi> and tranſports on all ſides in this Church, (where the projects and practiſes of particular men rather ſerved their private paſſions and preſumptions, than the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Inſtitutions, Chriſts glory, or the Churches generall good,) theſe have already ſo fully confuted their <hi>Authors</hi> and abettors <hi>confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences,</hi> by the ſin, ſhame, weakneſſe and fatuity of them, that they need no blacker marks or deeper brands of diſlike, than thoſe which they have with their own hand ſet upon their <hi>fore-heads</hi>; having brought the things of Religion to ſo great a deformity as it is this day, by their <hi>praeter, ſubter</hi> or <hi>ſuper-conformities,</hi> either beyond the uſe, intent, or indulgence of the lawes, or beyond the conſtitutions and cuſtomes and intereſts of this Church.</p>
               <p>Thus while either reſtive and ſullen, or buſie and <hi>pragmatick Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi> will needs be breaking that <hi>hedge</hi> which their <hi>wiſe fore-fathers made, ſerpents have bitten them</hi>: while they would take <hi>burning coales</hi> from the <hi>Altar</hi> without <hi>tongs,</hi> (which the <hi>Seraphin</hi> uſed as the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary meanes) they have ſhrewdly burned their own fingers, in ſo much that many, if not moſt of them, I believe, would be glad they were every way fairly healed, to as great a ſoundneſſe of Order, Honour and Unity, as they formerly enjoyed; of which they were as weary as unworthy, whoſe indiſcreet <hi>forſaking</hi> that medium and meaſure of their happineſſe, which was wiſely eſtabliſhed by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick counſell and authority, hath been of late ſo many waies unbleſt and unſucceſſeful, that their very going out of the right way which was the way of Peace, Truth, and Order, hath ſomewhat prepared their feet for an happy returne. Every one that is ſo bleſt as to ſee their unlucky extravagancies, hath learned to eſteem the good old way better than heretofore they did; when private preſumption

tempted them to preferre their own novell fancies before the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick eſtabliſhments of ſuch a famous Church and renowned Nation as <hi>England</hi> was.</p>
               <p>I make no queſtion but many men are grown <hi>wiſe</hi> by their own woes; others at a cheaper rate have bought wiſdome by obſerving the fruits of their neighbours folly, <hi>raſhneſſe</hi> and <hi>weaknes.</hi> Some have deeply ſuffered for their former <hi>Hydropick</hi> fullneſſe, reſtiveneſſe and lazineſſe in Religion, contracted by long peace, great plenty, and high preferments; which it is farre more honour to uſe pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and profitably, moderately and wiſely, than to enjoy pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſly, ſuperciliouſly, luxuriouſly and idly: others are brought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to utter <hi>conſumptions</hi> of Religion by their own <hi>Calentures,</hi> and thoſe Hectick fevers which have ſo long afflicted themſelves and (as contagious or ſpotted ſickneſſes) infected others. Some of all ſides and ſorts have ſuffered. I am ſure all are threatned, becauſe each par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hath by their paſſionate tranſports rather ſtudied to advance their private opinions, parties and intereſts, than the common and publick good of this Church and Nation; <hi>mutuall ſufferings</hi> (which have taken from all ſides the confidence of their innocency) have ſo wrought upon all men of ſerious piety and honeſt purpoſes, as by this <hi>fiery triall</hi> to purge them from their droſſe of common infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and to refine them for ſome further ſervice to this Church and State. Nor do I doubt, but as other wiſe and good men, ſo particularly <hi>Miniſters</hi> of parts and piety, could they once amicably and authoritatively meet, confer and correſpond together, would ſincerely and cheerfully (by Gods bleſſing) agree upon ſome expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to recover the truth, order, honour, peace, uniformity and authority of the <hi>Reformed Religion</hi> and its Miniſtry in this Church and Nation; that neither they, nor <hi>you,</hi> nor <hi>your poſterity</hi> may be ever thus poſſeſſed, diſtorted, torne and tormented <hi>with evill Spirits,</hi> which ſometimes caſt us into the waters <hi>of cold</hi> and Atheiſticall irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions, otherwhile into the fires of <hi>intemperate zealotry</hi> and contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For ſo hath the Church of <hi>England</hi> paſſed through all the <hi>poetick racks</hi> and <hi>tortures,</hi> which (if not remedied) will be the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your poſterity, one while rolling <hi>Syſiphus</hi> his reſtleſſe ſtone of <hi>endleſſe Reformation,</hi> whoſe <hi>recoilings</hi> and <hi>relapſings</hi> ſink the true Reformed Religion to lower deformities than ever it was in: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this they muſt be put upon <hi>Ixions wheel,</hi> toſſed up and down with continuall <hi>circulations</hi> and <hi>giddineſſe</hi> of Religion, as every mans <hi>whimſicall braines</hi> liſt to turne it round; whereas Religious orderly motions ought to have, as their due bounds and circumference of truth, ſo their fixed centre of Chriſtian unity and publick commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, both which would in no long time (by Gods bleſſing) be <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gained in England,</hi> if ſome mens private policies and ſiniſter pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects did not (as wedges) ſtill hinder the cloſing and agreement of honeſt and impartiall men, in ſuch waies as would reſtore <hi>Religion</hi> to its juſt honor, <hi>Authority</hi> and conſiſtence; from the enjoying of which, after all the ſpecious pretences made on all ſides, we are ſtill as

far remote, as <hi>Tantalus</hi> was from eating thoſe fruits or drinking thoſe waters, which onely deluded, but never ſatisfied his famiſhed ſoul.</p>
               <p>Yet many good grapes and ſome faire cluſters are ſtill left upon this <hi>battered vine</hi> of the Church of <hi>England, in which I hope may be a bleſsing,</hi> which neither the <hi>little foxes</hi> of peeviſh <hi>Schiſmaticks</hi> have much bitten, nor the <hi>greater bores</hi> of <hi>Romiſh ſeducers</hi> have wholly ſubverted. Many well-meaning people, and not a few Preachers too, who formerly had their <hi>Midſummer-fits,</hi> and <hi>ſhorter Lunacies,</hi> as to their religion, are now ſo ſober in their ſenſes, and well recovered to their right wits, that having once tried that <hi>vanity</hi> and <hi>vexation,</hi> that <hi>froth</hi> and <hi>futility</hi> of Spirit, which attends all factious <hi>inquietudes,</hi> and exotick <hi>innovations</hi> obtruded upon a well-<hi>ſetled Church,</hi> they are reſolved ever hereafter to avoid and abhorre them; as being no better than <hi>ſpecious poyſons, delicate deluſions, ſpirituall debaucheries</hi> and religious lucuries, which growing from <hi>plethorick tempers</hi> in mens ſoules, (eſpecially where they are high fed with duties) do eaſily tempt them that are leſſe cautious and moderate both to wandrings and wantonneſſe in Religion, firſt to ſimple fornications, and at laſt to groſſe and foule <hi>adulteries</hi>; to which men (otherwiſe of <hi>commendable ſtrictneſſe</hi> and <hi>purpoſes</hi>) are eaſily betrayed, if (as <hi>Dinah</hi>) they give way to the temptations of <hi>novelty, curioſity, popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity,</hi> and <hi>ambitious</hi> vanity in Religion, there, where it hath been well and worthily ſetled by <hi>publique</hi> counſell and joynt conſent; yea and hath been happily enjoyed for many Ages, with almoſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous, I am ſure very marvellous proſperities, ſo as it was, beyond all diſpute, here in the Church of <hi>England.</hi> The inconſiderate ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and diſorderings of whoſe religious conſtitution, many men (of all ſorts) are now ready to recant and expiate, if by any honeſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours they may recover the order, unity, beauty, authority and ſtability of Religion in this Nation.</p>
               <p>To whoſe Eccleſiaſtick <hi>communion</hi> I perceive many (heretofore more warme than wiſe, more credulous than conſiderate) are now <hi>cordially</hi> returned, as to their judgements and conſciences; to which, no doubt, their <hi>converſation</hi> would willingly conforme, if once they could ſee any enſigne of religious <hi>uniformity</hi> authoritatively ſet up in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Many Miniſters would willingly recant and return from their vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and vulgar <hi>tranſports,</hi> if they could but have a <hi>protection</hi> for their <hi>foreheads,</hi> or a <hi>skreen</hi> to hide that ſhame and diſcountenance, which they feare hangs over them for their levity, from the <hi>common-peoples</hi> cenſures and ſcorns. Not a few <hi>Ministers</hi> (ſometimes order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and regular enough) would fain get free from thoſe popular <hi>lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twigs,</hi> which have too long held them, if they did not feare to loſe ſome of their <hi>feathers,</hi> either as to their reputation or maintenance; who flying from that good ſenſe which was heretofore ſet in the Church of <hi>England</hi> for their defence, would needs light on that bare hedge for their refuge and <hi>perch,</hi> which proves to moſt of them no
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:97412:231"/>
better than the beggars buſh, fuller of gins and ſnares than of berries or food.</p>
               <p>O how glad would hundreds of popular <hi>preachers</hi> and preaching people be, to be commanded by ſuperiours to make (not <hi>verball,</hi> but) <hi>reall retractations</hi> of their errors, <hi>ſeductions, ſurpriſes, ſchiſmes,</hi> and <hi>apoſtaſies</hi>? that ſo their <hi>variableneſſe</hi> in Religion might ſeem to ariſe not from their private innate levities, but from either fatall or ſoveraigne neceſſities; which are alwaies good ſalvo's, and go for cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent excuſes among common people, either to plead for their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies, or to juſtifie their changes, eſpecially when they are reduced to the better.</p>
               <p>Many Miniſters of <hi>Presbyterian</hi> and <hi>Independent</hi> practiſes rather than perſwaſions or principles, now (together with their followers) who formerly were highly <hi>a-gog,</hi> (even when they were yet in their <hi>downe, pin-feathered,</hi> and ſcarce fledge) in thoſe fine ſpeculations and rare projects which they had fancied for erecting new models of <hi>Church-work,</hi> after the formes of Conſiſtories and Elderſhips, Claſſes and congregations of Corporal Spiritualties, &amp; Spirituall Corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which were to be reared out of the ruinous, nay out of the moſt intire parts of the Reformed Church of <hi>England,</hi> which was by them to be wholly ruined, though it were by the Lawes of God and man, by conſtitutions Eccleſiaſticall and Civill, both wiſely formed and happily fixed in the Primitive and Catholick form of <hi>order</hi> and <hi>dependency</hi>; yet even theſe men and Miniſters of deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, not edification, with their late <hi>Chappels of Little-Eaſe,</hi> would I am confident be now very glad to be handſomely ſheltered under the protection of ſome ſuch <hi>Epiſcopall</hi> ſeat, faire <hi>Cathedrall</hi> or <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-Church,</hi> with which <hi>England</hi> formerly abounded, to the great honour of the Nation, no leſſe than of the <hi>Clergy</hi> and Miniſtry of all degrees: the <hi>Slips</hi> and <hi>Shrubs</hi> of Churches, (which ſome have late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly planted) thrive ſo ill, that they wiſh them fairly removed and rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted into that ancient ſtock, that goodly and venerable tree of <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> which was ſo flouriſhing and ſo fruitfull to all orders of Chriſtians in <hi>England,</hi> and in all ancient Churches, ever ſince the firſt plantation of Religion in this <hi>Iſland,</hi> or the other world.</p>
               <p>O how would all ſober Miniſters and others rejoyce to come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that ſhade and ſuperintendency which might not ſadly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drop, but gently protect every Miniſter and member of the Church, in their ſeverall branches and boughs?

If left free, we grow inſolent, popular and factious; if under any Government or reſtraint, we grow touchy, refractory and petulant; not eaſily kept within our own or others bounds, untill by preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant reaſon and prevalent power, meeting together in wiſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute magiſtrates, we are at once convinced and commanded, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded and over-awed to keep thoſe honeſt bounds of order and ſubjection, which do not onely beſt become us, but ought to be leaſt arbitrary, becauſe moſt neceſſary both for our own and the publick good: moſt of us will be good ſubjects even to Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment as well as State, when we ſee we muſt be ſo; and few of us

                  <pb n="434" facs="tcp:97412:236"/>I well know that Miniſters in <hi>England,</hi> above all ſorts of men, do ſtand bound in conſcience and prudence to uſe all faire meanes for the ſpeedy ſetling and happy reſtitution of the State of <hi>Religion</hi> in this Church; becauſe however many of them profeſſe to be great <hi>patrons</hi> of piety, and ſticklers for <hi>Reformations,</hi> either old or new, yet moſt, if not all our Church-deformities and miſeries, have been and ſtill are imputed chiefly to their immoderations, paſſions, or indiſcretions, when too much left to themſelves: Some driving ſo furiouſly to conformity, that they went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond it; not onely over-ſhooting themſelves, but the good Lawes, Canons, and Cuſtomes of this Church, hereby putting the common people into high jealouſies of ſuperſtition, by their too great heats, and <hi>ſurfeits</hi> of <hi>ceremonious innovations</hi> and <hi>affected forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities:</hi> Other Miniſters were ſo jealous and impatient of what they fancied, rather than <hi>felt,</hi> to be burthens in Religion, that they not onely caſt off ſome ſuperfluous loades of new ceremonies, but the very comely <hi>Garment, Girdle</hi> and Government of this Church; yea ſome of them at laſt flung off all their clothes, and tare off (as <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules</hi> in his fiery ſhirt) much of their own skins, by a <hi>frantick</hi> kind of exceſſe, ſeverely revenging even other mens reall or imputed faults upon themſelves and upon the whole Church, committing greater injuries than ever they did or indeed could ſuffer, while they poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their ſoules in patience and peace; whereas now they have left themſelves and this <hi>whole Church,</hi> (as the Tortoiſe did, that was wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of its <hi>ſhell,</hi> and <hi>put it off</hi>) almoſt nothing for ſafety, comelineſſe, or honour, but are nakedly expoſed to all thoſe <hi>dangers</hi> and <hi>defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities</hi> which attend any Church, Religion and Miniſtry, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once ungirt as to order, unity and Government, will ſoon be <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt</hi> as to all holy improvements either in Piety, Verity, or Charity.</p>

upon the life of <hi>Religion,</hi> as Chriſtian and Reformed; alſo upon the honour of the Clergy, and the happineſſe of the people of <hi>England.</hi> I ſee the ſenſe of their own and the peoples <hi>nakedneſſe,</hi> (as to <hi>Eccleſiaſticall</hi> union and Government) hath made <hi>Miniſters</hi> ſeek for ſome covering for themſelves, though it be but of <hi>fig-leaves,</hi> in compariſon of that goodly <hi>Garment</hi> which God had formerly clothed them withall, after the manner of all <hi>ancient Churches,</hi> who were governed, adorned and defended by <hi>Epiſcopall Eminency, Preſidency,</hi> and <hi>Authority,</hi> ſtrengthned with <hi>Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Counſells, and further helped by the ſervice and care of Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, or Overſeers for the poor, to complete the well-Governing of the Church with Charity, Wiſdome, and Orderly Authority: So that neither the Wiſe, Strong, Great, or Rich, might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant and unruly; nor the Simpler, Weaker, Leſſer, and poorer ſort of Chriſtians be neglected and contemned.</p>
               <p>A method of Church-Government, certainly, not more ancient and <hi>Catholick,</hi> than <hi>complete</hi> in all the requiſite proportions of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which had in it not onely all principles of reaſon, polity and prudence, but was further commended and confirmed by the ancient patternes of Gods own appointment among the <hi>Jewes,</hi> by Chriſts Doctrine and example, together with his Apoſtles practiſe and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, evident in their writings, and in the imitation of all Churches from the beginning.

               <p>
                  <hi>Preſbytery</hi> hath been already ſo baffled in England, and <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> hath ſo little place or credit, both are ſuch exotick novelties, and ſo incompetent for Church-Government, that neither ſingle nor ſociall, ravelled nor twiſted, they will ever have any conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble power, nor be able to give any protection to either Miniſters or people, much leſſe will they promote the Reformed ſtate of Religion, or the peace of the Nation.</p>
               <p>The community of Miniſters and people, though never ſo much Aſſociated in ſuch levelling factions, will ſtill appeare, both to their enemies and friends, but as ſo many <hi>ſilly ſheep,</hi> who, fearing to be further <hi>worried</hi> by <hi>wolves</hi> and <hi>dogs,</hi> do <hi>flock</hi> together indeed with great eagerneſſe and crowding, but they are not thereby much the

               <p>As it is hard to draw a true <hi>circle</hi> unleſſe the <hi>centre</hi> be fixed, or to build a firm <hi>arch</hi> without the binding and <hi>centre-stone</hi> be added to the reſt; ſo I firmely believe, that neither the intereſts of <hi>people</hi> by <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency,</hi> nor of <hi>Presbyters</hi> by <hi>Presbytery,</hi> will ever be advantaged to any honourable, happy, or durable condition by theſe Aſſociations, if they arrogantly and factiouſly uſurp the rights and power of Primitive Epiſcopacy, which hath been alwaies as uſefull as vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in the Church of Chriſt, either uſed, or approved, or deſired by all learned and ſober men, and aſſerted by infinite, pregnant and unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable teſtimonies, both ancient and late.</p>
               <p>Nor will, I hope, the Antiquity, Sanctity and Majeſty of Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and Catholick Epiſcopacy ever want ſuch Princes &amp; Peers, ſuch Presbyters and people, as both in true polity, and in good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, will ſo approve it, as to preferre it no leſſe before all <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern models,</hi> than the firſt temple was preferrable before the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, or either of them before the <hi>Tabernacle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If theſe <hi>Aſſociations</hi> do onely intend, as ſome of them pretend, to take in all <hi>intereſts,</hi> with reſervation of latitudes and freedomes, both of different principles and practiſes, to all ſorts of Miniſters, will they not prove at laſt Diſſociatings, and amount to no higher edifying of this Church, than the laying of brick and ſand without lime, which will never make a durable and ſtrong building? For they will ſoon divide and diſſolve who are held together by no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bond than their own will and pleaſure. Poſſibly thus farre they may be of uſe, as means ſomewhat to diſcover more the rubbiſh and ruines of our late diſtractions, which have made Miniſters ſo much ſtrangers, that they are enemies to each other; yea, poſſibly they may, by drawing them to ſome amicable conventions and Chriſtian conferences, occaſion <hi>better underſtanding</hi> between many of them, and ſo by Gods bleſſing in time produce ſome ſuch coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels as may be worthy of them and the publick. But if their aime be ſlily to get into ſome hands ſuch popular advantages (by their ſoft inſinuations of ſeeming equanimity and moderation,) as ſhall further diſplace and diſparage the former Catholick Government of this and all ancient Churches, they will be but as new patches put to an old garment; which will make the rent and deformity the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>Certainly, the ſtate of the <hi>Reformed Religion</hi> in England will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be happy till it is ſetled, nor ſetled till it be uniform, nor uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, till the office and authority of <hi>Miniſters</hi> be valid and vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, nor will this ever be, untill the ſanctity and ſameneſſe of <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> together with the uſe of Eccleſiaſticall power and holy Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations, be rendred ſo <hi>August,</hi> ſo <hi>Sacred</hi> and <hi>Complete,</hi> as may

be moſt conforme to <hi>Scripture</hi> and to <hi>pure Antiquity</hi>; for while <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters</hi> are of diverſe <hi>makes</hi> and <hi>moulds,</hi> they will be of diverſe minds, nor can they produce other than <hi>multiforme Christians,</hi> of different faſhions and deformed factions in Religion; which do as neceſſarily bring forth infinite miſchiefs in any Church or Chriſtian State, as the itch breeds ſcratching, and ſcratching fetches blood. As the bleſſed Apoſtles, ſo their holy ſucceſſors kept to one way of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Order and Power; which preſerved the unity of faith and love among Chriſtian Biſhops, Presbyters and people.</p>
               <p>I confeſs, I do ſometimes in my ſad and retired ſolitudes hope, that our common calamities may, by Gods ſoftning and calming grace upon mens ſpirits, make both all <hi>Godly Ministers</hi> and all good people ſo wiſe, as humbly, ſincerely and charitably to ſearch into the cleare ſteps of <hi>Primitive prudence, Apoſtolicall order,</hi> and <hi>Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Authority,</hi> which had due and tender regard to all ſorts of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, ſo as to keep up a meet <hi>ſubordination</hi> with a Chriſtian com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; To which end I was willing to hope this ſhew of <hi>Aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation</hi> might conduce.</p>

               <p>Again, when I conſider how paſſion and pride betrayes many men to raſhneſſe, raſhneſſe to folly, folly to obſtinacy, obſtinacy to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, preſumption to animoſities, and theſe to unchriſtian fewds, everlaſting deſpite and bitterneſſe, which muſt ſtill be vented as cholerick humors once in a month againſt the moſt innocent and Primitive <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> yea againſt the moſt deſerving and yet moſt ſuffering <hi>Biſhops,</hi> of this Church, and of all the world, old and new: when I ſee the perſonall errata's and exorbitances or infirmities of ſome few <hi>Biſhops,</hi> by moſt uncharitable Synecdoches, (which put a part for the whole) are in a pittifull fallacious way of vulgar ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory urged againſt all Epiſcopacy and <hi>Biſhops</hi> in any orderly emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency or preſidentiall authority in the Church, contrary to the faith and honour of all antiquity, and the former happy experiences of this Reformed Church: when I find how wary and ſhy ſome Miniſters are (in their zeal and forwardneſſe for their petty <hi>Aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations</hi>) to ſeem to own even their own judgements and reall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations toward any ſuch <hi>condeſcentions,</hi> and cloſe with Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy as may reflect upon their former <hi>tranſports</hi>; how loth they are really and freely to offer ſuch propoſals as are equable and ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, pure and peaceable, to the Epiſcopall party, who aim at no more than ſuch a <hi>paternall preſidency</hi> and order, as may beſt preſerve the undoubted power of ordination and Eccleſiaſticall Juriſdiction, as it was Primitively ſetled in and tranſmitted by the hands of the firſt <hi>Biſhops,</hi> who immediately ſucceeded the Apoſtles:</p>

I believe no good Chriſtian is ſo blind as not to ſee, that faith cannot in this world be ſeparated from charity, that Churches diviſions are their confuſion; as leaky and unhoop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed veſſels let out much, if not all the good liquor in them.</p>

               <p>Civill reſpect to Miniſters of the Goſpel will follow, where there is a <hi>religious regard</hi> to their Miniſtry, as ſacred and Divine, indeed as Chriſts, for ſo it is, or it is none upon any religious account: Therefore I forbear to urge <hi>you</hi> with any importunities, in order to reſtore the Priſtine honors and dignities, the many priviledges and great plenty, which the <hi>Clergy</hi> enjoyed in <hi>England.</hi> I know thoſe are unſeaſonable motions in an <hi>iron age,</hi> amidſt ſo many <hi>ſacrilegious Spirits</hi> as envy even thoſe <hi>pittances</hi> that yet remaine of oyle in the cruſes or meale in the barrels of poor <hi>Miniſters,</hi> who are (generally) in a low, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, ſqueeſed and almoſt <hi>exhausted</hi> condition: not onely publick exactions, but private <hi>ſharkings</hi> of people, in many, if not moſt places, have reduced heretofore <hi>convenient livings</hi> to pittifull <hi>tenuities.</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters affect indeed to wear <hi>longer haire</hi> than they were wont; but
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:97412:241"/>
their condition is now ſo much ſhorne and ſhaved, ſince the <hi>Scots raſor</hi> was firſt applyed, that moſt of them are very bare and quite bald, to the great joy of <hi>Papiſts</hi> &amp; the viler ſort of licentious people, who want but one vote more to perfect their deſired <hi>Reformation</hi>; That is, to take away all tithes and glebes, rather giving them to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loch</hi> or <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> than to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> his Church and his <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery,</hi> to whom theſe are paid by many men ſo grudgingly, ſhark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly and ſuperciliouſly, that few Scholars of any <hi>generous</hi> minds and parts will apply themſelves now to be <hi>Miniſters</hi>; and many grave men, heretofore devoted to that calling, are content to be ſilent, rather than to preach to ungratefull and gain-ſaying people; yea ſome Miniſters think it better to <hi>ſtarve</hi> with honor, than to be fed with <hi>ſcorn,</hi> preferring any calling before that, which muſt firſt work, then beg or conteſt for its wages.</p>
               <p>But as the <hi>poverty</hi> and tenuity of Miniſters, the popular contempt of their perſons and calling, the neglect and irreverence of holy miniſtrations, the intruſions and uſurpations of petulant people up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their function; as all theſe could not have grown upon them, had they not been ſcattered and divided among themſelves (for by theſe cracks and leakes thoſe bitter waters have prevailed thus far to ſink and depreſſe them:) So the reducing of Miniſters to ſome unity in their judgments, to uniformity in their Miniſtrations, to an identity or ſameneſſe for their Miniſteriall power and ordination, alſo to a decent ſubordination and government among themſelves, theſe methods would be moſt effectuall, beyond any thing I can think of, to remedy all thoſe great inconveniences and miſchiefes under which they now labour and grone. From Miniſters mutuall ſeparations, affrontings, reprochings, oppreſſings, and deſpiſings of one another, common people have learned the language and carriage of clownery and contempt: For how can people ſee any thing worthy their civill, much leſſe conſciencious reſpect and love toward any Miniſters, when they ſee, hear, and read, how they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciate and ſcorn, envy and maligne, ſhun and abominate one another on all ſides, each invalidating or diſparaging the others au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to officiate, and almoſt annulling all they do in holy duties as Miniſters? Be they never ſo able and fit as to their gifts, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, utterance, holy lives and good report in all things; yet ſtill they are thought by ſome ſide or other either to enjoy more than they merit, or to arrogate more than is their due, or wholly to u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurp that which is no way their due.</p>
               <p>Certainly, it is not a more pious and Chriſtian, than <hi>heroick</hi> and <hi>prudent work,</hi> to reconcile the diſcrepancies and feuds that are grown among <hi>Miniſters</hi> of <hi>ſeverall</hi> formes and names, as to their <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> or admiſſion to their Miniſtry. And, ſince there are on all ſides men of very good abilities, commendable lives, and uſefull parts in this publick ſervice, as Miniſters of the Church, it is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite pitty that Chriſtians ſhould be by any prejudices deprived of the common benefit to be had by them; or by factious and frivolous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminations,
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:97412:242"/>
if their Miniſteriall Authority be fruſtrated of thoſe many bleſſings which all good Chriſtians might happily enjoy, both publickly and privately, by a firm union and uniformity among all true Miniſters, both in the <hi>origination</hi> of their power, alſo in the manner of the derivation and diſpenſation of it: Which harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as (without doubt) it would highly contribute to the honor of the reformed Religion, ſo it would much obſtruct the advantages which Popery gets by the ſcandall of Miniſters diſcriminations and diviſions in this point. For what ſober-minded man will not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther adhere to what ſeems uniform, though an error, than to what ſeems divided, though a truth? Men will rather turne Seekers, Quakers, and Enthuſiaſts, than weary themſelves in dancing after every Miniſters pipe, and the new tunes they ſet to both their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry and holy Miniſtration.</p>
               <p>For my part, I ſhould rather chooſe to live in a ſolitude as a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Chriſtian, or retire to any corner of the land as a Miniſter, than to correſpond with ſuch ſocieties of Preachers as are either evidently Schiſmaticall in their principles, or onely formally and partially <hi>Aſſociating</hi> in their politick practiſes, which do but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare their ſpirits to be at as great diſtance from their duties, both to their betters and their equalls, as ever they were. I prefer a <hi>cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage</hi> in a ſmooth and peaceable wilderneſſe, before ſuch palaces as are built among briars and thornes. I am ſorry and aſhamed to ſee thoſe Miniſters who are able and worthy to uſe the trowell for edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, ſhould be ſo eagerly imployed at the ſwords, for mutuall deſtruction: Since they generally agree to preach and live Chriſt Crucified, ſince they do for the maine correſpond in <hi>doctrinalls</hi> of <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>morality,</hi> yea in holy Myſteries and Miniſtrations; what a miſery is it they ſhould not all endure the ſame impoſition of hands, or the ſame holy and Catholick ordination? yea what pitty is it, they ſhould not all dare to ſay publickly and Miniſterially the ſame Creed, the Lords prayer and the ten Commandements; to all which I ſuppoſe they all are ready privately to ſay Amen? How ſad a proſpect is it, to ſee thoſe men who profeſſe ſuch zeal for Church Government and good Diſcipline, to be ſo little governed or correſpondent in any wiſe communion and diſcreet ſubordination among themſelves? And all this while every plauſible preacher is ambitious rather to ordain and governe others after his own fancy, than to be ordained and governed as a Miniſter after the Apoſtolicall pattern, and that one ancient forme which was univerſally owned and uniformly uſed in Chriſts Church, both for the ordination and ſubordination of Miniſters.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N order therefore to invite all able,<note place="margin">A ſcrutiny of what is good or bad in all parties.</note> Orthodox and honeſt Miniſters to ſome Chriſtian correſpondency and fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall accord, it will not be amiſſe for me to preſent both to your equanimous wiſdome, (O worthy Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men) and to your piety, what I humbly conceive the beſt Medium to be uſed in ſo great and good a work, which muſt be tenderly and impartially carried on by a ſerious diſcovery and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning, Firſt, what is really good, uſefull, and commendable in any party, that this may be allowed and preſerved, agreed to and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced by all; Secondly, what either is or ſeems defective or ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, evill or inconvenient, ſcandalous or dangerous on any ſide, that this may be either pared off and removed, ſince it may be well ſpared, or elſe in reaſon and Religion, in piety and charity, ſo qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified and moderated, as may comply with what is truely good and uſefull for the publick on all ſides.</p>
               <p>Firſt then to begin with <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> not as it enjoyes or loſeth the benefits of ſecular favour in eſtate, honour, or juriſdiction, (which are not eſſentiall to it, any more than cloths are to the man) but as it appeares in its <hi>Apoſtolick primacy</hi> of Order, in its Catholick centre of Unity, in its chief power for Ordination and Eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction; which it ever enjoyed among good Chriſtians, though it were never ſo poore and abaſed by civill powers, as it was in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive times of <hi>perſecution</hi> for 300. yeares.</p>
               <p>The reall good of true <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> (which undoubtedly hath the cleareſt,<note place="margin">1. The beſt and worſt of Epiſcopacy.</note> beſt and moſt ancient title to ordination &amp; Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, according to the cuſtome and preſcription of all Ages for 1500. years) is Decency, Order, Unity, Authority, Stability, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Preſidency, Grave Government, with ſubordination of younger to the elder, and inferiours to ſuperiours, agreeable to the rules of right reaſon, and the meaſures of the beſt polities, military, civill and religious. Here are the apteſt remedies and conſervatives againſt Schiſmes, the fitteſt mediums for Catholick Councils, for correſpondencies, conventions and Communion of Churches, not in popular rabbles and heady multitudes, but in their chief Preſidents and repreſentatives. In <hi>this</hi> is beſt kept up, as an Uniformity of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches, ſo a <hi>Catholick Conformity</hi> to the Church univerſall, when Primitive, pureſt and moſt perſecuted, which without any peradventure did follow the Apoſtolick preſcription and pattern in all things of ſo univerſall uſe and reception.</p>
               <p>Upon the head of <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> as upon the <hi>hill of Hermon,</hi> hath the dew of heaven, the bleſſings of God, as in temporall enjoyments, ſo in all ſpirituall gifts and graces, moſt plentifully faln, and from that to all the lower valleys and inferiour parts of the Church. To <hi>this</hi> it is that all the moſt learned, moderate and wiſe men in all the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an world, of what ever party or ſide they are in other things, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:97412:243"/>
Latine or Greek, <hi>Lutheran</hi> or <hi>Calvinian,</hi> Proteſtant or Papiſt, all agree in this, that <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> is the ancienteſt and apteſt, the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt and nobleſt, the onely Apoſtolick and Catholick, conſequently the beſt and compleateſt of Governments in the Church; contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in its right conſtitution and uſe all the pretended excellencies of all other Governments, and ſomething more than any of them, as the crown and perfection of all.</p>
               <p>The evills, defects and dangers incident to Epiſcopacy, (and riſing not from the function or imployment, but from the perſons <hi>of Biſhops,</hi>) are pride, ambition, ſecular height and idle pomp, a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>percilious deſpiciency, and Lordly tyrannizing over other Miniſters, and the flocks of Chriſt under their inſpection; arrogating a power to do all things imperiouſly, arbitrarily and alone, without any due regard either to that charitable ſatisfaction which was anciently given to Chriſtian people, or to that <hi>fraternall</hi> counſell and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence, which might and ought in reaſon to be had from learned and grave Presbyters, or ſuch Conſiſtoryes of choiſe <hi>Miniſters,</hi> who poſſibly may for wiſdome, piety and ability, be equall to the Biſhop, however they are inferiour in order and authority.</p>
               <p>As the complete good of <hi>preſidentiall and paternall Epiſcopacy</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves above all other formes to be eſteemed, deſired and uſed in the Church; ſo it may eaſily and happily be enjoyed, if the perſonall faults and failings of Biſhops be prevented and avoided, which is no hard matter where Biſhops are choſen (as anciently they were) by the ſuffrages of the Presbyters or Miniſters of the Dioceſe either perſonally preſent, or, to avoid noiſe and tumult incident to many, by their proxyes and repreſentees choſen and ſent from their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall diſtributions. The Biſhop thus choſen is eaſily kept within bounds of moderation, if he do nothing of publick concerne validly and concluſively without the preſence, counſell and concurrence of his appointed Presbyters; being further reſponſible for any miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>government, to ſuch conventions of the Clergy as are meet to be his judges, and are by the Laws appointed ſo to be. Certainly theſe limits, ſupports and ornaments of Epiſcopacy, would eaſily reſtore it to and keep it in the compaſſe of its Primitive beauty, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, and uſefulneſſe to the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2. Triall of Presbytery.</note>The good of Presbytery (eſpecially in conjunction with Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy) is grave and impartiall counſell, ſerious diſcuſſion and well-adviſed deliberation, ariſing from many learned and Godly men, which is as the joynt and concurrent aſſiſtance of all the Clergy; whoſe publick ſuffrages may carry all things Eccleſiaſtick as with leſſe partiality, ſo with more authority, moſt ſatisfactorily to Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and people too, yea and with leſſe odium or envy upon any one man as Biſhop or Preſident, in caſes that ſeem leſſe popular, or in cenſures that are more heavy.</p>
               <p>Beyond all this ſome men cry up Presbytery in its Ariſtocratick influence, as the great Choak-peare of <hi>Antichriſt</hi>; as the beſt receipt in the world to make the Pope burſt in pieces, like the pitch and
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:97412:243"/>
haire which <hi>Daniel</hi> mixed to ſplit <hi>Bel</hi> and <hi>Dagon</hi>: This, this they ſay is the ſtrongeſt ſenſe againſt all tyranny, uſurpation and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Church-men, the great <hi>conſervative</hi> not of an abſolute pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but of thoſe ancient priviledges which are due to all Miniſters; alſo of thoſe liberties and indulgences which are the peoples dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, while they ſee all Church-matters managed not by <hi>private and partiall monopolies,</hi> but by publick and generall complacencies of all ſober and good men, at leaſt the major part of them.</p>
               <p>The evils of Presbytery in a parity or equality are, emulation, faction, diviſion among Miniſters; the younger ſort naturally muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying againſt the elder, and the graver ſort thinking themſelves more wiſe &amp; worthy than the younger. Hence grudgs and coldneſses, cavils and contradictions, ſidings and diviſions; Hence adherings to ſeverall heads and patrons of factions, in different opinions or practiſes. Then follow popular adherencies, and ſuch declamatory endeavours as may moſt draw people to ſeverall <hi>Masters</hi>: all which are ſufficiently evidently the experiences of <hi>Franckfort</hi> of old, of <hi>Roterdam</hi> in later years, alſo of new and old <hi>England</hi>; beſides the intolerable petulancies and troubles by Maſterly Presbyters in <hi>Scotland</hi> for many yeares in King <hi>James</hi> his <hi>minority,</hi> and King <hi>Charles</hi> his too. All theſe have loudly proclaimed that <hi>malapertneſſe, rudeneſſe, inſolency, effrontery, factions, confuſions,</hi> are the genuine fruites of an un-ſub-<hi>Presbytery,</hi> as indeed of all Government which is made up with parity or equality, which is rather a lump or maſſe of fleſh, like monſtrous and abortive births, than any comely polity or ſymmetry befitting an organized body, which muſt have ſome prime part for the honor, order and regulation of the whole, which muſt needs be looſe, diffuſed and confuſed, if it be not cemented, centred and fixed (yea ruled and awed) with ſome eminent part and principall power, which having virtue from the whole, gives alſo life, vigor, firmation and Majeſty, as to the whole body, ſo to the Government and polity, what ever it be, civill or Eccleſiaſtick; being as the Hoopes or Curbes of veſſels, which keep all the <hi>pipe-ſtaves</hi> together.</p>
               <p>The want of which authoritative order, decorum and majeſty in Government, is prone to give ſuch temptations to young and hot-headed <hi>Miniſters,</hi> (beſides giddy and ſurly people, moving them to ambitious novelties, to popular and prepoſterous <hi>practiſes</hi>) that men of parts cannot eaſily reſiſt them. Beſides, the generality of people, either of meaner or better quality (eſpecially in <hi>England</hi>) will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have ſuch reverence to petty Presbyters in a levelled parity, as they will have when they ſee Miniſters united, guided, honored and animated by a perſon of that Gravity, Age, Worth and Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency, that not onely the beſt Miniſters own him as a Father, but the beſt Gentlemen, yea Noblemen, will reverence him as a man of excellent Learning, Piety and Wiſdome; whoſe cenſure or ſentence no man of modeſty or conſcience can deſpiſe, when they are managed with ſo much reaſon and Religion, with ſuch order and
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:97412:244"/>
honor, with ſuch gravity and integrity, as become ſuch Biſhops and ſuch Presbyters, happily united in a comely ſubordination.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">3. The Triall of Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency.</note>The good that Independency pretends to hold forth to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, or Chriſts little flock, in its ſeverall parts and leſſer par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, is a more neer union and endeared love of each other, a cloſer care and watching over each others ſouls, more frequent and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar intercourſes between Paſtor and people, exerciſing of their own, exciting and diſcovering of their brethrens gifts and ſiſters graces, neerer Communion with each other, after the faſhion of bodies, though ſmall, yet ſo complete and confined to themſelves, that they are neither ſubject nor reſponſible to any but their own choſen members, officers and paſtor; whoſe Tribunitian, not impera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torian, power is immediately founded (as they ſay) in the very plebs or herd of people, as derived immediately from Chriſt, and ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely endued with all Church-Power or ſpirituall authority, that they are to Try, Elect, Ordain, Cenſure, Rebuke, Depoſe, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate and give over to Satan any part of their body. They further profeſſe an Art or Receipt they have above all others to keep all ordinances of Chriſt moſt entire and pure from all humane mixtures and inventions, moſt ſet off and adorned with that Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, Sincerity, Fervency, Charity and Sanctity which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the Goſpel; all which are moſt eminently manifeſted in the precincts of their little bodies, their Independent or Congregatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Churches, farre beyond what ever either Epiſcopacy or Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery, ſeverally or ſocially, could attain unto. Theſe are the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryings of Independency.</p>
               <p>The evils laid to the charge of <hi>Independency</hi> are, firſt, novelty and inconformity to all pious antiquity. A way untaught, untryed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought of by any Chriſtians that owned themſelves as parts of the Church Catholick, and related to its grand community or ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred ſociety. It meanly and miſerably confines the Majeſty of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall power, and ſhrinks its authority; it drawes the Churches polity and communion to ſo very narrow and ſmall a compaſſe, that Independency ſeemes to act rather by diſtorted and convulſive mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, than by that equable harmony of parts which attends all or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly bodies in their concurrent motions. Farther, it expoſeth par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches or congregations, together with the honor and ſafety of Religion and all Chriſtian States, to petty parties and fractions, to popular, nay plebeian humors: It abaſeth the honor of the Evangelicall Miniſtry, weakning the power, and diminiſhing the dignity of all Chriſtian ſocieties, mincing and deſtroying thoſe ancient <hi>Grand and Goodly combinations,</hi> which were Apoſtolicall and Primitive, in the reſpective Churches of <hi>Jeruſalem, Antioch,</hi> the 7. Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and many others, cutting them into ſmall chips and ſhreds. It placeth the ſole and abſolute power of the keyes, for <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> there where no wiſe man, much leſſe the wiſe Redeemer of his Church, would place them, even among the vulgar, where are ſeldome found any fit ſubjects capable to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:97412:244"/>
much leſſe to manage and uſe them. That ſuch are the common ſort and major part of all people, no wiſe man is ignorant: though they may be plainly and ſimply good, yet ſeldome are they ſo prudent, ſo knowing, ſo compoſed, or of ſuch credit and reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as is fit for any <hi>Government</hi> either in Church or State to be committed to them, as the grand Maſters and abſolute Dictators; which they ſeem to be in the Independent modell, which either hath ſo many heads that it hath no feet, or ſo many feet that it hath no head.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, Independency ſeems like the flats and ſhallowes of ponds and rivers, the proper beds for all <hi>Faction</hi> and <hi>Schiſme</hi> to ſpawne upon; the <hi>ſeminary</hi> that breeds, and nourſery that feeds all the <hi>vermine</hi> of Religion; while every ſilly ſoul, that can but get two or three to conſpire with his folly, and flatter his new fancy, may without feare or wit make a Miniſter, begin a party, and beget a Church, built and diſtinguiſhed by ſome new character of opinion or practiſe, as its badg or ſign-poſt.</p>
               <p>Beſides this, <hi>Independency</hi> is indicted by many ſober men as a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon or plagiary, a ſacrilegious robber of other Churches, one that ſteales away <hi>Children</hi> from their <hi>Spirituall</hi> fathers, ſheep from their flocks and ſhepherds, ſeducing ſervants from their Maſters, and children from their parents, true Religion, worſhip and devotion, yea from all Chriſtian Communion with them; entiſing them firſt to <hi>ſtraggle,</hi> then to ſeparate, then to <hi>ſtarve</hi> rather than returne to the good paſture and fold whence they have once <hi>wandered.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, as it affects an equall and yet enormous power in every part of the whole body; ſo it exerciſeth this authority with ſuch <hi>confuſion</hi> and <hi>paſsion,</hi> with ſo much <hi>Childiſhneſſe</hi> and <hi>petulancy,</hi> that there is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or nothing of due <hi>ſubordination, feare, reverence</hi> and <hi>ſubmiſsion,</hi> as to any Divine Authority, as of Conſcience of or for Chriſts ſake; but every one takes offence when he liſteth, growes froward and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent, divides, and ſo deſtroyes (as much as in him lyes, and at as eaſie a rate as one doth cruſh a worme) thoſe petty bodies and puny Churches, which are indeed but <hi>Infants, Embryo's</hi> and <hi>Pygmies,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to that ſtature and ſtrength, that procerity and puiſſance, which of old was preſerved, and ever ought to be in the Church of Chriſt, when it hath its peace and growth; not ſhred into poor patches and pittifull parcels, but united, maintained and managed in conſpicuous combinations, in ample and auguſt proportions; in which may well be contained many thouſands of Chriſtian peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſome hundreds of worthy <hi>Presbyters</hi> and <hi>Deacons,</hi> under ſome one or more <hi>venerable Biſhops,</hi> in ſo holy, ſo happy, and ſo hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome a <hi>ſubordination</hi> or <hi>dependency</hi> as was of old, that whatever was done by the <hi>Authority</hi> of thoſe that ruled, or the <hi>Humility</hi> of thoſe that obeyed, all was done with <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Unanimity,</hi> while excellent Biſhops knew how to keep the true temper of Chriſtian Government, and both Presbyters and people concurred with them in <hi>filial obedience</hi> and <hi>fraternall love.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hus we ſee every party or ſide, however it juſtifie or magnifie it ſelfe, yet it falls under either the blame or jealouſie of its rivals, as defective or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive; yet not ſo much in the <hi>fundamentals</hi> of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, or main points, either for Doctrine, Worſhip, Duty, or Manners, as chiefly in matters of Ordination, Diſcipline, and Government: Nor is the difference here ſo broad, that any ſide denies them as neceſſary both in the parts and whole, in greater and leſſer proportions, for the Church of Chriſt; but the reall diſpute is, <hi>who ſhall mannage and execute them,</hi> in whom the chief power and <hi>Authority</hi> ſhall reſide, whether eminently in <hi>Biſhops,</hi> or ſolely in <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters,</hi> or ſupremely in the people, as the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> the firſt recipient and the laſt reſult of Church-power.</p>
               <p>All ſides (except Fanaticks, Seekers, and Enthuſiaſts) ſeem to agree, as in the <hi>Canon of the Scripture,</hi> ſo in the ſoundneſſe of the <hi>faith,</hi> in the ſanctity of divine <hi>myſteries,</hi> in the celebration of them by ſuch as are ſome way <hi>ordained</hi> and <hi>authoriſed</hi> for that holy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; alſo in the participation of them by ſuch onely as are in the judgement of Charity worthy or meet to be partakers of them. All agree in the main Chriſtian graces, virtues, and morals required in a good Chriſtians practiſe; yet ſtill each party is ſuſpected and reproched by others: the brisk <hi>Independent</hi> boaſts of the Liberty, ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, and purity of his way, yet is blamed for Novelty, Subtilty, Vulgarity &amp; Anarchy; the rigid <hi>Presbyterian</hi> glories in his Ariſtocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Parity and levelling community, which makes every petty Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter a Pope and a Prince, though he diſdain to be a Prieſt, yet is tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for <hi>petulancy, popularity, arrogancy</hi> and <hi>novelty,</hi> caſting off that Catholick and ancient order, which God and Nature, Reaſon and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, all civill and military policy, both require and obſerve a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all ſocieties.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> juſtly challengeth the advantages, right and honor of Apoſtolick and Primitive Antiquity, of univerſality and unity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond any pretenders; yet is this condemned by ſome for undue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crochments and oppreſſions upon both Miniſters and peoples inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous Liberty, and Chriſtian priviledge, by a kind of <hi>ſecular height</hi> and arbitrary <hi>ſoveraignty,</hi> to which many Biſhops in after-ages have been betrayed, as by their own pride and ambition, ſo by the indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of times, the munificence of Chriſtian Princes, and ſometimes by the flatteries of people.</p>
               <p>Take away the popular principle of the firſt, which proſtrates Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to the vulgar; Take away the levelling ambition of the ſecond, which degrades Government to a very prepoſterous and unproportionate parity; Take away the monopoly of the third, which ſeems to ingroſſe to one man more than is meet for the whole: each of them will be ſufficiently purged (as I conceive) of what is

               <p>I meane that <hi>Primitive</hi> order and <hi>paternall reſidency</hi> which was univerſally acknowledged to be eminently in one <hi>Preſident,</hi> as <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop</hi> or chief Paſtor over many <hi>Presbyters</hi> in his Dioceſe, after the pattern of the 12. <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> who were by Chriſts appointment above the 70. and ſo their declared <hi>ſucceſſors,</hi> as <hi>Timothy, Titus, Archippus,</hi> &amp; thoſe others who are called the Angels of the 7. <hi>Aſian</hi> Churches, with many others to whom they derived, not onely their example and practical <hi>constitution,</hi> but their <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> Eccleſiaſtical as is evident by the <hi>Canons</hi> and <hi>Rules</hi> ſet forth, not onely in ancient Councils, but in the <hi>Epiſtles to Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> for the ſetling and managing of Church-order, Diſcipline and Government, in ſuch a way as clearly gives not to any conſiſtory, or company of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and people, but to one man a <hi>Paramount</hi> Authority, as <hi>Biſhop</hi> or Superiour, both in <hi>Ordination</hi> and <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> above others as his <hi>inferiours,</hi> and ſo <hi>ſubordinate</hi> to his ſpirituall power ſo far as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, examine, cenſure, reject, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>All which being to me immoveable and immutable foundations for the eſtabliſhing of Epiſcopall preſidency (as the onely <hi>ſucceſsion</hi> of that ordinary <hi>Apoſtolick</hi> power and authority which is neceſſary to be alwaies in the Church of Chriſt) they do make me dayly by theſe conſiderations more reſtive and leſſe compliant to any new waies or <hi>Aſſociatings</hi> than perhaps otherwiſe I ſhould be, both by the ſociableneſſe of my temper, and my earneſt deſire for another way of happy union among Miniſters of worth and moderation.</p>

               <p>I will not ſuſpect any honeſt-hearted or worthy <hi>Miniſter</hi> of having been ſo baſe and ſacrilegious in his <hi>Spirit,</hi> as therefore to cry down <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> root and branch, new and old, good and bad, out of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret hopes of <hi>filthy lucre</hi> and ſecular glory, expecting ſome benefit by plundring the perſonall eſtates of Biſhops, or by ſequeſtring the revenues of their Churches, or gaging to buy at laſt ſome good peniworths of them.

weary of it, when they clearly ſee that all ages and actions of the Catholick Church have ſufficiently declared, beyond any fallacy of identity as to Names and titles, the reall and actuall differences of perſons and duties, or offices, to which words may (at firſt) be indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently applied without implying any ſuch confuſion of places and powers in the Church, any more than when the name of <hi>ruler</hi> is applyed, to <hi>ſupreame</hi> and ſubordinate Magiſtrates, or when the name of <hi>Officer</hi> is given to Corporalls, Lieutenants, Captaines, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonells and Generalls, or that of <hi>Alderman</hi> to ſuch as are ſo by age, or office, or eſtate; juſt as if one ſhould obſtinately maintain that the petty <hi>Constables</hi> of every pariſh, the High Conſtables of every Hundred, and the Lord high Conſtable of <hi>England</hi> or <hi>France,</hi> were the ſame things, as to office, power and honor, becauſe the ſame name of <hi>Conſtable</hi> is applyed to all of them.</p>

               <p>I know there have been many things ſpeciouſly urged for <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery,</hi> and odiouſly againſt <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi>; all which have been ſo abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly anſwered, that it is time they were forgotten, and all enmity buried with them.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Anſ.</note>To this it is eaſily anſwered, That however Presbyters of old did, and of right (as I conceive) ought, by the leave and permiſſion of Chriſtian Princes, to chooſe and appove the <hi>perſons</hi> of their <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,</hi> as being the fitteſt men in the Church to judge of a <hi>Biſhops</hi> ſufficiencies for that place and charge, yet it no way followes that any Biſhop hath his Spirituall or Eccleſiaſticall power from them, as the originall of it, any more than of his temporall Barony and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues, to which he is admitted by the Presbyters election of him;
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:97412:254"/>
but only he is by their <hi>election</hi> and comprobation duly admitted, and regularly enabled to exerciſe that <hi>power,</hi> whoſe roote (as that of Presbyters) riſe and foundation is from a far higher principle and greater authority: Juſt as the <hi>Fellowes</hi> of a <hi>Colledge</hi> chooſe the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, Preſident or Warden, at leaſt they admit and accept of him to the poſſeſſion, enjoyment and uſe of that power, which is not in them joyntly or ſingly without their <hi>Maſter</hi>; nor yet is it derived from them to the <hi>Maſter,</hi> but he hath it from the firſt Founders Will, and the <hi>Statutes</hi> or Cuſtomes of the <hi>Colledg.</hi> In like manner, the <hi>chief Magiſtrate</hi> of any <hi>City</hi> or <hi>Corporation,</hi> though he be choſen by the Commons or Fraternities in it to his chief place and office, yet his <hi>power</hi> and <hi>juriſdiction</hi> is not from them, but from that <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> or <hi>Grant</hi> which gave the firſt conſtitution to that <hi>power</hi> and <hi>polity.</hi> So in an <hi>Army, Officers</hi> may chooſe their <hi>Generall</hi> to a power above them, which he enjoyes and exerciſeth beyond what any one or all of them hath right unto, or any capacity to uſe; yet doth that power accrew to him from thoſe principles of Right, Reaſon, Order, Polity and Authority, which is derived and veſted in him by the ſuffrage or conſent of many, who have right and reaſon thus to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe for their common order and ſafety, by preferring one above themſelves; by whoſe ſuffrages and conſents, as by the Suns beames united in the centre of a burning-glaſſe, a greater heat and luſter of authority is raiſed, than is in any one or many beames ſcattered and divided.</p>
               <p>By vertue of which principles of reaſon, order and polity, as theſe other civil inſtances, which act by their ſeverall <hi>Charters</hi> and <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,</hi> are neither left at liberty to chooſe or not chooſe any to be their chief <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> or <hi>Governour</hi>; nor yet may they in right rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or law exerciſe that paramount power without him, but they are bound in conſcience and duty, as well as by cuſtome and charter, to chooſe ſuch a chieftane, and ſo to inveſt him in that power pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramount above them; yet do they not give the power to that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect perſon, but the perſon to that power which was ſetled before them.</p>
               <p>So in the <hi>Church of Chriſt, Presbyters</hi> of old did freely chooſe (indeed) their <hi>Biſhops,</hi> at leaſt they conſented afterward to accept of him whom the Prince, or poſſibly the people in ſome caſes, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated as a worthy and deſerving perſon; yet neither <hi>people,</hi> nor <hi>Prince,</hi> nor <hi>Presbyter</hi> did conferre upon any <hi>Biſhop</hi> that power E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopall or that eminent Eccleſiaſticall Authority, which he had properly in himſelf to uſe and exert it after he was thus choſen, conſecrated and inſtalled. No, he had it from that <hi>grand Charter</hi> and <hi>Catholick Custome</hi> which was in the Church of Chriſt; by which the firſt Apoſtolick <hi>Canons</hi> or Scripture-Statutes and Inſtitutions not only founded, but derived this <hi>Authority</hi> as received from Chriſt, and by the Spirit of Chriſt conveyed it to their Succeſſors the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,</hi> in the name and power of Chriſt, for the orderly governing of his Church in all places; which hath been, and (I think) ought where
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:97412:255"/>
God hinders not, to be continued in the Churches of Chriſt by the like ſucceſſive choiſe or approbation of <hi>Presbyters</hi> in the want and vacancy of their <hi>Biſhops.</hi> Nor do I doubt but Miniſters are ſinfully wanting to that duty which they ow to Chriſt and his Church, when they ceaſe to do, as much as in them lies, what they ought in this point to do, &amp; might do if themſelves did not hinder, their chooſing and having their lawful <hi>Biſhops,</hi> as well as people their Presbyters, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Primitive rule and Catholick pattern, which hath the force of a law: it being no leſſe neceſſary for the Church to be <hi>orderly governed</hi> and thus <hi>united,</hi> than to be taught and communicated to in holy things.</p>
               <p>Nay, thoſe two or three <hi>Biſhops</hi> which, after the great <hi>Nicene Councill,</hi> were required to joyne in the more ſolemn <hi>conſecration</hi> and inveſtiture of every <hi>Biſhop,</hi> did not impart of their own power, but ſolemnly declared and bleſſed as good and worthy the choiſe and <hi>investiture</hi> of him that was firſt duly elected by the Presbyters, and then further confirmed by their publication and benediction, which benediction was never, that I read, done by any Presbyters, as being now inferiours to him whom their conſent and ſuffrages had choſen to that <hi>Epiſcopall</hi> degree and eminency above them, who as Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters might chooſe their <hi>Biſhops,</hi> but yet not depoſe him; this work requiring their appeal to the higher power of a <hi>Council</hi> or <hi>Synod</hi> of many <hi>Biſhops,</hi> who were in that joynt capacity above any one <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop,</hi> and ſo onely capable to be his judges, upon the complaint of Presbyters or people againſt him. As Presbyters have their Office and Authority by <hi>Biſhops</hi> ordination as conduits, but not from them as fountaines of it, (there being but one ſpring of it, which is Jeſus Chriſt) ſo <hi>Biſhops</hi> have their power by Presbyters election, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments or mediums, but not from their donation, as the <hi>ſource</hi> and <hi>originals</hi> of their power and authority,<note place="margin">Obj. 3d.

               <p>Thirdly, Some <hi>Presbyters</hi> and <hi>Independents</hi> do with great brow and confidence urge, that Biſhops are wholly ſuperfluous, becauſe <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> and any ordinary Preachers, two or three or more of them, are very able and willing every where to beget their like, every petty Presbytery is become a ſeminary or ſpawner to ordain Miniſters and conferre all degrees of <hi>holy orders</hi>; for which they think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves no leſſe fitted than for preaching and adminiſtring Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which (they ſay) are employments requiring greater abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and no leſſe authority: yea many Country-Presbyters have made themſelves and one another of late <hi>Chorepiſcopi</hi> or Country-<hi>Biſhops,</hi> ordaining Miniſters when, where and how they liſt, without any Biſhop among them.</p>
               <p>And this (they ſay) with very good ſucceſs and acceptance to Country-people, who beſides the pleaſure they take in any daring novelty and inſolency in Religion, proteſt to find no leſſe judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, diſcretion and gravity, than was heretofore pretended to be in <hi>Biſhops</hi> for that ſervice: Nor is it to be doubted (ſay they) but the ordination, authority and Commiſſion of ſuch Presbyters is as
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:97412:255" rendition="simple:additions"/>
valid as that done by <hi>Biſhops,</hi> ſince theſe Godly Miniſters do ſo try and examine ſuch as come to be ordained, that they commonly poſe the beſt Schollars and ſobereſt men that come to them: Further they pray and preach as well as moſt <hi>Biſhops</hi> did, yea they very gravely exhort and charge the ordained brother with as great weight and ſeverity, both for gifts and graces Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſteriall, as ever the <hi>Biſhops</hi> did, though it may be not with ſo much pomp and formality.

               <p>Poſſibly, extraordinary caſes may in time be their own excuſes in ſuch Churches where <hi>Biſhops</hi> may be all dead or baniſhed; or where ſuch as are Orthodox cannot be had, and they that are will not ordain any <hi>Presbyters,</hi> without impoſing upon them ſuch things as are erroneous and unlawfull: but nothing can be pleaded that I yet ſee, no nor doth the candor and charity of <hi>Biſhop Uſher</hi> know how to excuſe ſuch Presbyters from being <hi>Schiſmaticks</hi> &amp; <hi>factious, preſumptuous</hi> and <hi>diſorderly,</hi> who firſt caſt off and forſake ſuch <hi>Biſhops</hi> as are of the ſame faith and reformed profeſſion, worthy and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, able and ready, every way authorized by Church and State to do their duty.

                  <hi>Objection</hi> much flouriſhed by ſome popular Preachers againſt <hi>Biſhops</hi> and all <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> in any Authority and eminency above <hi>Presbyters,</hi> is, that <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> is the root of <hi>Popery</hi>; that <hi>Prelates</hi> were the <hi>parents</hi> of Antichriſt; that every <hi>Biſhop</hi> hath a <hi>Pope</hi> in <hi>his belly</hi>; and that the <hi>Pope</hi> is no other than an overgrown <hi>Biſhop</hi>; that to rout all <hi>Popery,</hi> and raze the foundations of Romes pride, all <hi>Prelacy</hi> or <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> muſt be ſtubbed up.</p>
               <p>My anſwer to this is, that this objection ſounds as little of truth as it ſavours much of malice,<note place="margin">Anſ.</note> eſpecially in any <hi>Presbyters</hi> of any lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and ingenuity, who well know the abaſing of <hi>Biſhops</hi> is the deſign, and hath been the magnifying of the <hi>Popes</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> beyond their line and meaſure of old; That if <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> could have held its Primitive and ancient parity, according to the Apoſtolick ſeates and paternes, that one Chaire of <hi>Rome</hi> had not ſo far exalted it ſelf in this Weſtern Church above all thoſe that are therefore <hi>called Gods,</hi> becauſe the power of Chriſt and the <hi>word of God came to them</hi> as much as to <hi>Rome,</hi> and is to be derived by them to their ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>Tis certain that <hi>Biſhops</hi> did not at firſt (as <hi>Nimrod</hi>) ſet up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by any private ambition: they were either conſtituted by the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> yet living, as <hi>Irenaeus, Euſebius, Tertullian</hi> and others tell us; or when the Apoſtles were dead, the <hi>Presbyters</hi> of every chief city and Territory or <hi>Dioceſe</hi> did (as S. <hi>Jerom</hi> tells us) chooſe ſome <hi>Apoſtolick</hi> and eminent perſon from among themſelves to be their <hi>Biſhop</hi>; not compelled hereto by any civill powers, nor by any popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar force or faction, but meerly moved ſo to do by the precept and pattern, the conſtant cuſtome and imitation of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> which were ſo full of pregnant reaſon, neceſſary order, and holy policy, that nothing could be better.</p>
               <p>If any then be to be blamed for giving occaſion to the <hi>Papal am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,</hi> and what ſome count the great Antichriſt who is, (as <hi>Iſid.

to their pattern, but in order to preſerve neceſſary polity, Primitive unity, and Apoſtolick authority in the Church of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And yet now (behold) by a ſtrange <hi>vertigo</hi> or change of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, <hi>Presbyters</hi> muſt in all haſt pull down all <hi>Biſhops,</hi> the better to avoid Antichriſt, who lies as much in confuſion as error, in ſchiſme as in hereſie; none of which will ever advance Reformation or ſetling of true Religion. So that it is an intolerable inſolency and rudeneſſe of ſome men, to ſay or ſuſpect that every <hi>Biſhop,</hi> whom the Apoſtles themſelves, or the Presbyters after them, firſt conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, were but <hi>ſpawnes</hi> and <hi>embryo's</hi> of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> when many, yea moſt, if not all the firſt and beſt <hi>Biſhops</hi> for 300. yeares were not onely excellent preachers and wiſe governours after the way of the Apoſtles, but ſuch reſolute <hi>Martyrs</hi> and confeſſors, as few of the more <hi>delicate Presbyters</hi> and ſofter-fingred <hi>Independents</hi> of our age would willingly carry the leaſt ſtick of their fagots, or touch the leaſt <hi>coale</hi> of their fires, or bear the leaſt ſtroke and burden of their <hi>tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> As then the Papall Tyranny, ſo the Presbyterian Parity, and Independent Anarchy, may and will give (I fear) greater advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages to <hi>Antichriſts,</hi> than ever Epiſcopall order and eminency either did or can do while wiſely ſetled and managed.</p>

As I believe Epiſcopacy by this time ſees it did it ſelf as much wrong as any men could deſign, in doing many things of <hi>publick concern</hi> without the preſence, counſel and concurrence of their graveſt and moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet <hi>Presbyters</hi>; and as I think that modeſt and ſober <hi>Presbyters</hi> ſhall do not onely themſelves a right, but the beſt <hi>Biſhops</hi> too, in their Chriſtian adviſe and aſſiſtance, to bear (<hi>partem ſolicitudinis</hi>) part of the care, trouble, odium and envy, which is prone to offend all good <hi>Biſhops,</hi> as all good Governours in Church and State: ſo I conclude that violent <hi>Presbyters</hi> have done themſelves, the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> the people and this whole Church, as much injury and indignity as they well can, by rudely rejecting and obſtinately refuſing (as much as in them lies) to readmit the Order and Honor of Epiſcopall Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidency, which indeed was the common Honor of the whole Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy.

Certainly it was in prudence to be deſired by all wiſe Presbyters and other Miniſters, rather to bear much under the burden of the Epiſcopal yoak (which was to them more (<hi>honos</hi> than <hi>onus</hi>) a dignity than any depreſſion;) than thus by a precipitant impatiency to run themſelvs &amp; their whole Order or function into a plebeian ſlavery, while they affected an inordinate li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.

               <p>For my part, I can look upon <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> in its Primitive <hi>poverty</hi> and preſent <hi>bareneſſe,</hi> with as much reſpect and reverence as in its greateſt <hi>pomp</hi> and <hi>ſuperfluity.</hi> I value it and deſire it not for <hi>ſtate,</hi> but <hi>conſcience,</hi> not for ſecular ambition, but <hi>ſpirituall ſatisfaction.</hi> Let them keep <hi>the lands</hi> that have juſtly got them, or paid a valuable conſideration for them, provided they will but help to reſtore <hi>Primitive</hi> and Catholick <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> without which <hi>Eccleſiaſticall authority,</hi> yea and Miniſteriall power, ſeemes to me and to many wiſer men, if not wholly <hi>dead,</hi> and void or null, yet very <hi>defective, dubious</hi> and <hi>infirme</hi>; as one that is lame and maimed, yet is ſtill a man, having an <hi>eſſe</hi> or being as <hi>a true</hi> man, but yet <hi>eſſe defectivum,</hi> a being ſhort of that fulneſs, firmneſs and perfection which might be, were he ſo complete as he ought to be according to the pattern of God and nature.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Herculean</hi> work of <hi>reſuming</hi> Church-Lands, and reſtoring ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Revenues or civill Honors to Epiſcopacy, is not to be expected without a <hi>miracle,</hi> ſuch as ſhall <hi>ſhake heaven and earth,</hi> deſpiſing all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane oppoſition, and making the unjuſt keepers to <hi>be like dead men</hi>; for no thunderbolts of divine vengeance are more penetrant and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible, than thoſe which fall upon the head of ſacriledge, as both Humane and Divine Hiſtories tell us.</p>
               <p>True, I think it were an act worthy of this Nations priſtine piety and renowned <hi>munificence,</hi> to add ſomething comely for Hoſpitality and Charity, beſides civill reſpect, to <hi>Biſhops,</hi> if they will have any. Nor were it (as I conceive) a work leſſe <hi>becoming</hi> the Honor and Devotion of <hi>England,</hi> to repurchaſe and reſtore thoſe ancient <hi>Church-Lands</hi> or patrimony to the <hi>Church,</hi> than it was to take them away, and ſell them to <hi>lay-hands.</hi> But in this I am <hi>not ſo ſolicitous</hi>: the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of all <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and ſo of <hi>Presbyters,</hi> will be, diligently and wiſely to do <hi>the work of God,</hi> which (its probable) will never want the reſpect, love and liberality of all good Chriſtians, as was ſeen in <hi>Primitive times,</hi> where <hi>Biſhops</hi> were never <hi>poore,</hi> if Chriſtian people were in plenty, peace and unity. As <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> ſaid to <hi>David,</hi> ſo do I to all my Countrymen and brethren, Let <hi>Ziba</hi> take all, as to <hi>Biſhops Lands,</hi> ſo as thoſe <hi>Biſhops may</hi> returne in peace which are after the Lords mind and the Scripture-rule, the Apoſtles pattern, the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive judgement and Catholick practiſe in the Church of Chriſt. The leſſe there may be of riches and ſecular honors added to Epiſcopacy, the more it muſt provoke both <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Presbyters</hi> to holy indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry and eminent virtues, which are the beſt foundations of true ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor.</p>

               <p>I ſhould heartily rejoyce to ſee before I die the <hi>dry land</hi> to appeare, this deluge of factious confuſion not onely to abate but to be quite ſpent, by which Chriſtian Religion and true Reformation hath loſt (together with Epiſcopacy) in one ſcore of yeares very much of that publick Majeſty and Authority, that Power and Improvement, that Love and Honor, that Sanctity and Solemnity, that Charity and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which they formerly had and held in <hi>England</hi> for above a hundred yeares, highly to the glory of God, to the happineſſe of this Church, and to the Honor as well as Peace of the Nation.</p>
               <p>It is great pitty that any man who bears the name of a <hi>Miniſter</hi> of Chriſt ſhould appeare to the world other then an able, wiſe, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, holy, peaceable and orderly perſon; that we may not ceaſe to be ſociable and reaſonable <hi>creatures</hi> ſo ſoon as we undertake to be <hi>Preachers,</hi> as if we preſently turn'd <hi>Tragedians</hi> when we grew <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ologians,</hi> Divines in profeſſion but <hi>Devils</hi> in our diſſentions; that none of us may be ſo far bereaved of our <hi>wits,</hi> as to fancy that we <hi>Miniſters</hi> or Clergy-men, beyond all men, may not enjoy nor endure that comely and holy ſubordination which is lawfull and moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in all other ſocieties and fraternities of men, and no leſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe that are Presbyters or Preachers, where (we ſee) God and nature, age and gifts, learning and prudence, diſtinguiſh even theſe men ſo far, as makes ſome one or few very fit to govern, and the other, though many more, onely fit to be <hi>governed.</hi> There is much folly, raſhneſs, juvenility, indiſcretion, preſumption and vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garity to be ſeen even among the community of Miniſters as well as other common people; who can never be ſafe or happy, unleſs they be ſetled in ſome comely Government, Eccleſiaſticall as well as civill, yea and governed by ſome men that are much <hi>wiſer</hi> than <hi>themſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Certainly <hi>Religion</hi> cannot proſper or be glorious in the eyes of the world, as Chriſtian or Reformed, if it be not <hi>uniforme</hi> as to the main, both in its ſource and courſe, its origination and diſpenſation: For every notable difference (eſpecially in the ſame Church and State) ſeemes to the ſeverall parties and divided ſides as a great

deformity in their adverſaries. Religion will never be uniforme, if the Miniſters or diſpenſers of it be not wiſely united, not onely in their doctrine, but in the derivation and reception as well as diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of that holy <hi>Authority</hi> by which they <hi>officiate</hi>: for otherwiſe one Miniſter is prone to magnifie himſelf againſt all others of any other make &amp; mold, to diſparage all that is done by others as ſacred, to draw diſciples from one ſide to another, perſwading people, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the feuds which were between the <hi>Samaritan Jewes</hi> and Prieſts of that Temple againſt thoſe of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that what is done in holy duties by ſuch as are not of his ſtamp &amp; form is unauthorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, preſumptuous, invalid, meer nullities, and profanations of holy myſteries, without Spirit, Life, Power or Efficacy; an <hi>hiſtrionick</hi> page<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antry of Preaching, Praying, Baptiſing, Conſecrating, Celebrating, Cenſuring, Binding, Abſolving, Terrifying, Comforting, as in the name of Chriſt; when indeed there is either no power or authority, but a new one, that muſt needs be a <hi>falſe</hi> one, either uſurped, or obtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, or pretended, by thoſe that have nothing to ſhew for their Commiſſion, Order and Derivation of ſuch ſpirituall power, either from the <hi>Scripture,</hi> or the conſtant practiſe, or the Catholick <hi>Custome</hi> of the Church of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thus everlaſting feuds, diſtances and defiances will follow among <hi>people</hi> and <hi>Paſtors,</hi> where an harmony is not in <hi>this maine point</hi> of <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination,</hi> or <hi>Miniſteriall Authority</hi>; which certainly were no hard matter to effect, if Miniſters would ſo far agree (by an Epiſcopall ſubordination in an <hi>uniformity</hi> of <hi>ordination,</hi> and all other Eccleſiaſtical Miniſtrations) as no Miniſters or peoples <hi>just claime</hi> and intereſt ſhould be either neglected, excluded or oppreſſed.</p>

               <p>This method and moderation would (as I humbly conceive) both complete and ſettle, in all ſober mens judgements, the <hi>ordination</hi> of Miniſters, and (giving ſatisfaction to all juſt demands or ingenuous pretenſions) it would powerfully and happily unite both <hi>Biſhops, Presbyters</hi> and <hi>people</hi>; as anſwering all the claimes and expectations conſiderable of <hi>Epiſcopall, Presbyterian</hi> and <hi>Independent</hi> parties, as to the maine point of unanimous and uniform Miniſtry.</p>
               <p>Among whom a like <hi>correſpondency</hi> would eaſily<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (if wiſely and meekly) be carried on in all other <hi>Eccleſiaſticall affaires</hi> of publick concernment, for <hi>Doctrine, Worſhip, Diſcipline, Cenſures, Appeales, Admiſsion, Abstention, Excommunication, Abſolution, Synodal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions</hi> and the like. It is not imaginable how great an harmony, honor and happineſs would hence ariſe, to the infinite content and comfort of all good Chriſtians, to the great advantage of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion, to the peace of this Church, to the happineſs of the Nation, to the Glory of God, and to the unſpeakable quiet of many thouſands of poor ſoules; who are now <hi>agitated</hi> with infinite Scruples, Feares, Angers, Jealouſies and Deſpites in Religion, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as they are ingaged and exaſperated in their firſt entrance or beginnings: all theſe would peaceably and comfortably apply, by Gods help and Miniſters harmony, to the improvement of their ſoules in faith and repentance, in truth and love; to lead holy and orderly lives; to <hi>hear</hi> with <hi>diligence</hi> and reverence; to <hi>receive</hi> with frequency and charity; to <hi>pray</hi> with underſtanding and fervency; to <hi>do all</hi> things with meekneſs and wiſdome; laſtly, to <hi>die</hi> with earneſt deſire and bleſſed hope of further <hi>enjoying</hi> that Chriſtian and ſweet <hi>Communion</hi> with God, with <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and his <hi>holy</hi> Servants, Saints and Angels, in an other life, of which he hath had ſo bleſſed experience and pleaſing a fore-taſte even in this world, where the onely <hi>heaven</hi> a good Chriſtian can have conſiſts in the happy <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi> he hath with <hi>God</hi> and good <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> without which all ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety is but ſolitude or worſe, an harmony no better than what may be found in hell, which is a conſpiracy in ſin, and conjunction in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery.</p>
               <p>This holy Communion is ſo much the more divine and joyfull even in this world, by how much it enlargeth it ſelf to greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and extentions; true <hi>Chriſtian love</hi> being loth to be confined to a narrower compaſſe than the Chriſtian and Catholick faith is, but coveting (as light and heate) moſt ample dilatations and <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick diffuſions,</hi> ſeeking (if poſſible) and as <hi>much as in it lies,</hi> to live <hi>peaceably with all men,</hi> and chearfully with all that are of Chriſts fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, or the <hi>houſhold</hi> of <hi>faith,</hi> who love the Lord Jeſus in ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>

To which maine ends as all good Chriſtians ſhould chiefly bend all their Counſels, Prayers and endeavours; ſo, I do not conceive they are ſo ſtrictly confined and limited by any <hi>preciſe</hi> rules or formes of any externe Polity and Order, but they may, as occaſion requires, for the peace of the Church and edification of Chriſtians in love, uſe ſuch a <hi>liberty</hi> in their mutuall condeſcendings and compliances, as ſhall no way offend the bleſſed God of Truth, Order and Peace, nor violate any of their own conſciences, while they bear ſuch a tender regard to other mens, as they deſire may be extended to themſelves.</p>
               <p>The contentions and confuſions in <hi>Religion</hi> muſt needs be end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, if they be left to the naturall paſſions of moſt men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Then they may find happy concluſions, when thoſe that are Rulers and Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of others, and ſo not onely more learned, but more prudent, unpaſſionate and compoſed (as Magiſtrates and Miniſters ought to be, beyond any men) when (I ſay) theſe men do apply the utmoſt of their Piety, Power, Parts, Zeal and Diſcretion, by fit meanes to compoſe all controverſies among <hi>themſelves,</hi> which will then ſoon decay and dye among the common people.

               <p>I confeſſe I cannot but paſſionately deplore, as other mens, ſo my own <hi>ſolitude</hi> for theſe many yeares, by reaſon of that <hi>uncorreſponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> as to any fraternall meeting with any of them in any publick way; being hereby deprived of that great Comfort, Improvement, Joy and benefit, which might be had by thoſe <hi>excellent abilities</hi> and

graces which are in many of them.

               <p>Such holy and happy <hi>Aſſemblies of Miniſters,</hi> conſiſting of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritative <hi>Biſhops</hi> and orderly <hi>Presbyters,</hi> were farre more to their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and comfort, more befitting their breeding and learning, their labours and induſtry, their parts and worth, their ſacred function and dignity, than to be pittifully ſcared and over-awed by <hi>Country-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees,</hi> and a new ſort of <hi>Tryars,</hi> where grave Miniſters are oft cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſed, chaſtiſed and contemned by ſuch men as are (ſome of them at leaſt) of very <hi>moderate,</hi> that I ſay not meane, abilities (except their eſtates be inſtead of all reaſon and Religion, all learning, worth and wiſdome,) very incompetent judges (God knowes) of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Manners of Miniſters, unleſſe in matters of civill miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanors, for which there are <hi>higher courts</hi> and abler judges appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to heare and determine matters according to law, with more honor and leſſe partiality than Miniſters can expect from ſuch men as are very ſorry Magiſtrates and worſe Miniſters.</p>

               <p>And (in earneſt) it is high time for us as Miniſters of Chriſt, and as ſober men, to give over our popular Projects and pragmatick acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities, our ſecular policies and ſtate agitations, by which we have all gained far leſſe than if we had onely <hi>intended the Croſſe of Chriſt,</hi> and

               <p>It is moſt certain, that the major part of mankind, yea and of formall Chriſtians too, do not much care for the <hi>power of any Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> nor for the Authority of any Miniſtry, no nor for any ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious profeſſion or form of Religion, further than theſe may ſuite with their fancies, luſts and intereſts.

When men ſee <hi>new Religions,</hi> new Churches, new Miniſters and new modes of Ordination ſet up, to the reproch and defiance of all that went before, who, I beſeech you, of moſt ordinary Chriſtians (who are yet agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by their youthfull luſts and unbridled paſſions) will be ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant as <hi>to hold faſt</hi> that <hi>profeſsion</hi> which formerly they had taken up?

               <p>Many we ſee will have no Ordination, no Miniſters, no Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, rather than <hi>Biſhops</hi> ſhould have any hand in ordaining.

               <p>Nor will it be the work of an <hi>ordinary</hi> wit, whether <hi>Presbyterian</hi> or <hi>Independent,</hi> to ſalve all thoſe aſperſions and diminutions of either ignorance and blindneſs, or fatuity and credulity, or weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and impotency, which muſt neceſſarily fall from this account not onely upon the wiſeſt and beſt <hi>Church-men,</hi> but upon the moſt Chriſtian and wiſe Princes, the moſt zealous and reformed <hi>Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> who in the <hi>grand Reformation</hi> of this Church, and ever ſince for neer an 100. yeares, have after grave counſell and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture debate, approved and appointed, countenanced by a law, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by their actuall ſubmiſſion, the <hi>ordination</hi> of <hi>Miniſters</hi> chiefly by the authority of <hi>Biſhops,</hi> never without them.

               <p>It is moſt certaine that the Chriſtian and Reformed Religion will never be able to ſhine either clearly, or conſtantly, or comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly upon the conſciences of Chriſtians, either as Miniſters or peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, while it is in this great point of <hi>Ordination</hi> ſo darkned, clouded and eclipſed, that it lookes like the Sun <hi>wrapped in ſackcloth,</hi> or the <hi>Moon turned into blood.</hi> What Miniſtry, what Miniſters, what Ordination, what Ordained, what Ordainers, what Ordinances of Chriſt will (in time) be much eſteemed in <hi>England</hi> by the Nobility, Gentry or Yeomanry, when they ſhall ſee various waies of <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> daily invented and obtruded, pittifull <hi>Novelties</hi> induced, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form <hi>Antiquity</hi> diſcarded, Primitive Epiſcopacy exautorated, a ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate Presbytery ſcorned,<note place="margin">Veritatis prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatorem u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius diei spatio velut è luto ſtatuam fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunt. <hi>Nazian.</hi>

There goes much more to make a Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt, than to make a <hi>Conſtable</hi> in an Hundred or a Pariſh, or to make a <hi>Captaine</hi> in a Troop, or a Juſtice on a Bench; who yet cannot expect to be owned as ſuch, unleſſe they can evidence their Commiſſion and Authority to be rightly derived from the ſoveraigne originall of civill <hi>power</hi>: no more may Miniſters, unleſſe they can ſhew the right ſource and courſe of their ſacred Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p>While Miniſters preach and practiſe, Baptize and Conſecrate with divided <hi>tongues, distracted hands</hi> and <hi>diſtorted heads,</hi> as to this point of their <hi>Ordination,</hi> they are likely to produce no better ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, either to this <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Nation,</hi> than thoſe morter-men did, whoſe work deſerved the nick-name of <hi>Babel</hi> or Confuſion.

               <p>So that if once your Wiſdome and Piety (O worthy Gentlemen) could find a way to put the Clergy or <hi>Miniſtry of this Church</hi> (as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly we were) into an <hi>uniform</hi> way of ſacred, complete and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Authority as to their <hi>Ordination,</hi> then (and not before) will they appeare like the <hi>Angels of God aſcending</hi> and <hi>deſcending</hi> in their orderly courſes; then will they be enabled and eſteemed power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to pray to God for you, powerfully to preach from God to you, powerfully to conſecrate and exhibit holy myſteries to you: Then will they be like the <hi>Lamps of the Temple,</hi> or the ſhafts of the

               </p>
               <p>Whereas now Miniſters are in all Places, Cities and Countries wretchedly divided, monſtrouſly deformed, and miſerably diſabled, mutually accuſing and clamoring againſt each other, alwaies bark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or biting, or howling, either tormenting or tormented, as the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils in Hell.</hi> One <hi>ſuperciliouſly abhorrs</hi> what another devoutly <hi>adores.</hi> One <hi>vilifies</hi> what another <hi>venerates.</hi> One Miniſter with his party <hi>pulls down</hi> what another <hi>builds up.</hi> One <hi>execrates</hi> what another <hi>conſecrates.</hi> One <hi>nullifies</hi> what another <hi>magnifies.</hi> One formally officiates who is counted no <hi>Miniſter,</hi> and really is none; another is thought to be but halfe a Miniſter, or a kind of mungrell; a third is reputed for more than an ordinary <hi>Miniſter,</hi> as having his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion by inſpiration or conſpiration. One is thought ſuperfluous, yea ſuperſtitious, in his <hi>Ordination,</hi> becauſe he had a <hi>Biſhop</hi> with <hi>Presbyters</hi> to ordaine him; another is judged defective and dwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſh for want of a <hi>Biſhop</hi>; a third hath neither <hi>Biſhop</hi> nor true <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters</hi> to ordaine him, but either begets a body to himſelf as an head, or is choſen by a popular body to be their head. This makes both Preachers and people at ſuch diſtances and defiances in Religion, that one counts that <hi>ſacriledge</hi> which another boaſts of as <hi>ſacred.</hi> One is called a mocker of God, an uſurper in holy offices, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temner of the Churches Primitive and Catholick Cuſtome; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is derided as a doting <hi>Antiquary,</hi> a ſuperſtitious <hi>Prieſt,</hi> or proud <hi>Prelate,</hi> who can reliſh no bread but what is old and moldy, nor any drink but what is out of a <hi>Gibeonitiſh</hi> bottle.</p>
               <p>Thus are all holy myſteries and duties, which any Miniſters per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, made either very <hi>diſputable</hi> or <hi>deſpicable</hi> to the people, while all their authority on all ſides, as diſpenſers of them, is ſo much que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned, doubted, divided and denyed in the great point of their <hi>miſsion</hi> and <hi>Ordination</hi>; which is moſt <hi>eſſentiall</hi> to a <hi>Miniſter,</hi> and moſt fundamentall to any Churches Peace and Polity, requiring (next the maine Articles of Faith) to be ſetled in the cleareſt and moſt unqueſtionable way, with moſt uniform Authority, moſt conforme to all pious Antiquity; whoſe ancient and <hi>Catholick patterne</hi> as to <hi>Epiſcopall</hi> (that is Apoſtolicall) <hi>Ordination,</hi> is no more with pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to be changed either into <hi>Presbyterian</hi> or <hi>Independent new formes,</hi> than the Church hath cauſe to exchange <hi>Davids<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Pſalmes</hi> for any ſuch godly <hi>Balads</hi> or <hi>moderne Hymns,</hi> as we ſee ſome Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, with more piety (I hope) than good <hi>poetry,</hi> have ſometime commended to the harſh and unharmonious voyces of ill-tuned and ill-ſtringed Congregations.</p>
               <p>Adde to all theſe, not onely the <hi>inconveniencies,</hi> but miſchiefes, which are not more uncomfortable than pernicious to the intereſt of the true and <hi>Reformed Religion.</hi> For from the diviſions of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:97412:278"/>
as to their <hi>riſe</hi> and <hi>deſcent</hi> or <hi>Ordination,</hi> follow not onely ſtrangeneſs, but <hi>ſtrifes</hi> and <hi>emulations, evil eyes</hi> and <hi>ſecret feudes</hi> againſt one another, each being either jealous of, or contemptuous toward another. But furthermore, from this difference in their <hi>Ordination,</hi> they are tempted to affect, to broach and to preach different Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines. For thoſe <hi>peeled rods</hi> which alwaies lye before their eyes, as to their Orders or Characters, their Miniſteriall Admiſſions and Stations, do occaſion their <hi>conceiving</hi> and <hi>bringing forth</hi> a ring-<hi>straked</hi> and <hi>ſpotted kind</hi> of Religion, even as to <hi>Doctrine</hi>; that by the diſcriminations of their opinions either in faith or manners, they may more teſtifie their diſtances from, and animoſities againſt each other as <hi>Miniſters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Men of very good parts, yea and of piety many times (as Saint <hi>Jerome</hi> and <hi>Ruffinus</hi>) from leſſer diſputes and differences, are tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to wide and ſharp defiances; not onely as to their <hi>perſons,</hi> but as to their <hi>perſwaſions.</hi> Hence we ſee Miniſters of different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcents commonly affect to be known by ſome different points &amp; Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines. Presbyterians and Independents are thought generally to follow Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> in all points, as ſworne to his dictates or deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations; who was a man, though of excellent parts, yet not of Divine and infallible perfections, but mixed with humane infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, paſſions and imperfections. Epiſcopall Divines are ſuſpected moſt-what to have at leaſt a tang and reliſh of <hi>Lutheran, Arminian,</hi> &amp; <hi>Pelagian</hi> opinions; ſome are ſaid to run out to a rankneſſe of <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aniſme:</hi> though the moſt and beſt of them I know do confine themſelves to the Doctrine of their Mother the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which was neither inconſtant, curious nor ſuperfluous, but cleare, neceſſary and conſtant, owning no Dictator but Chriſt, and no Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of Faith but the Scriptures; doing and determining all things of Religion with great gravity, counſell, moderation, charity and circumſpection, beſides a juſt &amp; ſoveraigne Authority, which ſwayes much with the Epiſcopall Clergy. As the Church of <hi>England</hi> did not deſpiſe <hi>Luthers, Melanchthons,</hi> or <hi>Calvins</hi> judgement, ſo it juſtly preferred its own before theirs, or any one mans, being alwaies guided by the concurrent Wiſdome and Piety of many Learned and Godly Clergy-men, both <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Presbyters,</hi> no way inferiour to thoſe or any forraigne Divines, and in ſome things far their ſuperiours, not onely as to the eminent places they held in this <hi>Church,</hi> but as to the great diſcretion and temper of their Spirits; which made many of them fitter for the glorious Crown of Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome which they enjoyed, than either of thoſe two hotter-ſpirited, yet renowned men, who died in their beds, who had not onely to contend with the Papall errors and ſuperſtitions, which then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamely peſtered them and all Chriſtendome, but with their own paſſions and tranſports, yea and with thoſe many popular extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies which they rather occaſioned, I hope, than deſigned among the vulgar, who preſently fancyed that they had the precepts and patternes of thoſe great men, <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> to animate them
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:97412:279"/>
to popular, ſeditious, rude, injurious and <hi>rebellious</hi> methods of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation; in which the very plebs or populacy imagined them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves better able to judge of Religion, than any of their Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours in Church or State, and becauſe they had more hands, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they muſt needs have better hearts and heads to do that work, when and how they liſted. Which mad methods as the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> never uſed in its practiſe, ſo it perfectly abhorred in its Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, to which few Miniſters do heartily, ingenuouſly and fully conforme, who have forſaken its Diſcipline and Ordination; from which who ſo flies furtheſt, commonly wanders and wilders moſt in Enthuſiaſtick, Familiſtick and Anabaptiſtick opinions.</p>
               <p>In order to this deſigne of reſtoring an <hi>uniforme</hi> and <hi>Authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Ordination,</hi> O how ingenuous, how religious, how prudent, how juſt, how charitable, how noble a work would it be on all ſides, for wiſe and worthy men, to have ſome regard to thoſe few cluſters of <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> which are yet remaining in <hi>England,</hi> as a ſeed in which <hi>may</hi> be a bleſſing; if the learned and venerable <hi>Biſhops</hi> yet living among us were fairely treated and invited to ſuch a concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and common union in this point of Ordination as might tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit both it and their Authority, without any flaw or ſcruple of ſchiſme, interruption, or fraction, as moſt valid, complete and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick, to poſterity, according to the Catholick and Primitive pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne!

There can be nothing but claſhings, enterferings and confuſions in any Church, or ſociety of Chriſtians, where there are croſſe-grained, <hi>contradictive,</hi> or <hi>coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeited</hi> Miniſters, as to their Ordination. Here muſt be laid the principall and corner <hi>binding-ſtone</hi> of our happy Conſtitution and Communion as a Chriſtian Church, or Eccleſiaſticall polity. The affecting of novelty and variety in this (as to the maine of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteriall Order, Power and Authority,) had been the way to have made at firſt a very craſie and weak <hi>Reformation</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and is now the way to deforme, yea to deſtroy all again, giving infinite advantages to the projects and policies of <hi>Rome,</hi> alſo to the licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diſtempers of mens own hearts and manners: which conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have made me the more large and importune, as in a point of no leſſe conſequence and importance as to the viſible conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and managery of any Church, than the unity and uniformity of civill power or Magiſtratick Authority is neceſſary for any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth or Kingdom, where divided magiſtracy doth certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tend to <hi>diſtraction,</hi> and ſo to <hi>destruction,</hi> as our own late miſeries

do abundantly convince us, as to our civill peace and ſecular inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt: And truly no leſſe will a <hi>divided Miniſtry</hi> infallibly tend to the <hi>diſtraction</hi> firſt, and then the <hi>destruction</hi> of this Church and the Reformed Religion: a <hi>new</hi> Miniſtry portends either no Miniſtry, or no true one. And where moſt Reverend Epiſcopacy, (which hath ſo many glorious marks of Primitive Antiquity, Rare Piety, Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Proſperity, Undiſputable Univerſality, Apoſtolick Order, Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Authority and Divine benediction upon it; where this) comes after 1600. years of Chriſtianity, and one hundred yeares of an happy Reformation, to be queſtioned, baffled, exautorated, there is no great likelihood that the <hi>novices</hi> and <hi>punyes, Presbytery,</hi> or <hi>Independency,</hi> or <hi>Anabaptiſme,</hi> or <hi>Enthuſiaſme,</hi> ſhould take any great root in the love and eſteem of any <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who if Learned, Wiſe and Upright, muſt needs have greater confidence of and reverence for an <hi>Epiſcopall Miniſtry,</hi> than for any <hi>new-modes,</hi> which never yet had, at their beſt, any thing either very deſirable or very commendable in them, as to Wiſe and Grave mens affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and judgements.

                  <pb n="523" facs="tcp:97412:282"/>Much envy, ſpleen and bitterneſſe have by ſome popular and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious <hi>orators</hi> been heretofore vented againſt <hi>pluralities</hi> of <hi>benefices,</hi> when two or three would ſcarce make one <hi>competent living</hi>: A like cenſorious ſharpneſs hath been uſed by ſome againſt <hi>Biſhops ordaining,</hi> and <hi>admitting</hi> to poor and pittifull <hi>Livings</hi> ſome poor and pittifull Miniſters. Alas, better Miniſters cannot in reaſon be expected with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out better maintenance: Mend this, and then in Gods name mend the other; <hi>good workmen</hi> will not be had, nor can they live upon ſmall wages.

This <hi>Church</hi> had fared much better if ſome Miniſters bellies had been fuller. Some were ready to flatter any factious ſpirit that kept but a good Table, and would feed them without an affront: others having an envy at ſome of their brethrens and Fathers preferments were ready to turne all to confuſion; juſt as <hi>Joſephs</hi> brethren reſolved to make him away, becauſe of his gay coate and his dreames of honor. Men are then moſt willing to be quiet when they are at their eaſe. There was ſcarce one Miniſter that had any dignity or Church-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment, yea or a <hi>good Living</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> that was either forward or fomenting of our late troubles upon a Religious account.

               <p>As to the relief of <hi>Church-livings,</hi> much might in a few yeares be done, if the work were once well begun by <hi>publick adviſe</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent</hi>; partly by buying in of <hi>Impropriations,</hi> which are uſually little improvements to any Gentlemens Eſtates, and I believe no great cordiall to their <hi>conſciences,</hi> eſpecially while they ſee the <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsities</hi> to which <hi>poor Vicars</hi> and Stipendiary Incumbents are driven, beſides the <hi>ſorry proviſion</hi> that is made for poor <hi>peoples ſoules</hi> in thoſe <hi>Livings,</hi> where there is ſcarce bran enough left to make aloafe of bread for the <hi>Prieſt,</hi> or a cake for the <hi>Prophet.</hi> Some advantage might be further made by uniting two or three <hi>little Livings</hi> that are contiguous or neerly adjacent; it being no <hi>ſacriledge</hi> for two ſixpences or three groates to give a good <hi>ſhilling</hi> to the <hi>Temple.</hi> Much help alſo might be by aboliſhing all <hi>injurious</hi> and <hi>defrauding cuſtomes,</hi> which ought not to prejudice Gods right, or the <hi>Churches Dues.</hi> Nor would it be a ſmall comfort to Miniſters moderate <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings,</hi> if their rights and dues by <hi>Law</hi> or <hi>Cuſtome</hi> were once ſo <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued</hi> and ſtated by an <hi>equable rate</hi> in every pariſh, that there might be a power in ſome officer, as in other pariſh-rates, to levy them as they were ſetled and due, without any further <hi>vexatious</hi> and <hi>charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> ſuites at Law.</p>

I know ſome petty <hi>Lawyers</hi> and progging <hi>Atturnies</hi> will not favour <hi>this motion,</hi> thinking it will take griſt from their Mills; but ſuch of them as are pious, juſt, and generous Chriſtians, will as readily vote for and advance ſuch an Act for ſetling Miniſters rights, as they did that for <hi>treble dammages.</hi> Laſt of all, it would be an act of great eaſe and favour, if Miniſters might be ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And all this miſery for want of ſuch ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous meanes as ſhould invite, entertaine, encourage and <hi>oblige</hi> a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter to be able, carefull and painfull among them; which is now more neceſſary than heretofore, becauſe the faſhion we ſee is to have all <hi>duties</hi> expoſed to and performed by <hi>Miniſters private abilities</hi> and <hi>perſonall ſufficiencies,</hi> which are not to be obtained, nor maintained, nor encreaſed at cheap rates.</p>

               <p>Poſſibly God in time would decide which is the <hi>beſt way,</hi> if <hi>Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy,</hi>

               <p>But certainly, as the whole order and office of <hi>Presbytery,</hi> (which may have had its perſonall depravations alſo) ſo the ancient and venerable Authority of <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> as to its Primitive <hi>Inſtitution</hi> and <hi>Catholick ſucceſsion,</hi> ought not on any hand to be utterly ruined, raſed and extirpated root and branch, by any tumultuary raſhneſſe or <hi>popular precipitancy</hi>; which can never become any Church of Chriſt, or any wiſe and godly Chriſtians: nor can ſuch methods of ſharp and ſoure <hi>Reformations</hi> ever end in the <hi>peace</hi> or <hi>comfort</hi> of good men; who, (if they find themſelves guilty of exceſſes, ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and deſtructive to the true Church, true Religion and true Reformation) have nothing leſſe to do than to perſevere in their <hi>extravagancies,</hi> or pertinaciouſly to aſſert their former tranſports: yea they have nothing more to do ſpeedily and conſcienciouſly, than humbly to recant, ſeriouſly to repent, and effectually to amend, as much as lies in their power, the affronts and aſſaults, the breaches and waſts they have made of the Churches Peace and Unity, Power and Authority, by returning to that duty which they owe to God, and that obedience they owe to their ſpirituall Governours, and that reverence which they owe to uniform antiquity; which ſo fully <hi>commends</hi> the preſidentiall authority of <hi>Apostolicall</hi> and <hi>Primitive Epiſcopacy.</hi> Their firſt errors may be weakneſſe, but their obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy muſt needs be wickedneſſe; who ſtill ſin when they are convinced, ſilenced and afflicted.</p>

They never uſed any ſiniſter policy or pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, no fraud or force, nor any methods or engines to introduce <hi>Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy,</hi> other than ſuch as were neceſſary to bring in Chriſtianity in the true faith and holy myſteries of it, which have ever been embarqued with, ſteered by, and either perſecuted, or proſpered, together with <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopacy</hi>; whoſe diligence and devotion, peaceableneſſe and patience, both in their <hi>Dioceſes</hi> and in their Synods or Councils, aſſiſted by <hi>Presbyters</hi> of the ſame adherence and Communion, hath planted, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, propagated and beſt reſtored true Religion to all Nations, by ſuch demonſtrations of <hi>meekneſſe</hi> and <hi>wiſdome,</hi> as were loyall, juſt, pure, peaceable, gentle and eaſie to be intreated. They never did any thing menacingly and boyſterouſly againſt their <hi>Superiours,</hi> with threatnings or tumults, with ſedition or hoſtility, with faction or partiality: They did not preſently let fly bitter arrowes at the faces, hands, heads and hearts of all that refuſed their offers and motions; but onely <hi>ſhook off the duſt of their feet,</hi> and quietly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, if need were, as Chriſt <hi>commanded</hi> his Apoſtles and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. This was and is the temper of Primitive and true <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> as to civill peace and ſubjection.</p>
               <p>It is an obſervation not ſo ſtrange as too true, that all Spirits which are <hi>Antiepiſcopall</hi> are in ſome reſpects <hi>antimagiſtraticall,</hi> and moſt-what <hi>antimonarchicall:</hi> enemies to <hi>Biſhops</hi> are eaſily enemies to all <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> that are not of their own ſtraine and way. The firſt and great inſtance of which truth was and is in the <hi>Papacy,</hi> ſince the <hi>Biſhops</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> forſook the firſt humble, holy and martyrly princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of their predeceſſors, and challenged in Chriſts Name a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, Monarchy and Tyranny above all <hi>Biſhops</hi>; not content with a primacy of order, civility and precedency, which was ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly allowed as to other Metropolitanes, Primates and Patriarks, ſo principally to the <hi>Biſhops</hi> of <hi>Rome:</hi> not for the honor of their firſt <hi>founders,</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> nor for the renowne and orthodoxy
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:97412:299"/>
of the Romane Churches faith, (for theſe might be and were as <hi>remarkable</hi> in other Cities, as <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where Chriſt in perſon had been, ſo in <hi>Antioch,</hi> &amp;c.) but it was conſented and yielded to for the ſecular honor and glory of that mighty City, which was as it were the confluence, ſummary and center of all worldly greatneſſe, as the Queen of all Nations, whence all Lawes and ſoveraignty flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the civilized world, and terror to the other parts that were barbarous or enemies. The <hi>Imperiall power</hi> and <hi>Majeſty</hi> of that City induced all others to prefer it; and ſo the <hi>Biſhops</hi> of all other Cities made no ſcruple to yield the <hi>precedency</hi> of honor and order to the <hi>Biſhops</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> which was as lawfull as it was orderly. But when the Papall <hi>arrogancy</hi> lifted up it ſelf above its <hi>brethren,</hi> by a <hi>Luciferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> height, through the ſubtilty and importunity of <hi>Pope Boniface,</hi> as <hi>Platina</hi> in his life tels us, he afterward ſought to exalt himſelf above all that is called God; the Papall ambition very cunningly invading not onely the Rights of Kings and civill powers, but of the <hi>Eccleſiaſtick</hi> Rulers alſo: for the Roman policy ſaw that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it got above all Biſhops, it could not eaſily get above all Chriſtian Princes and Magiſtrates, which ſupported the honor and freedome of each other.

               </p>
               <p>I know in this point other novel <hi>Antiepiſcopal</hi> parties on all hands, have ſought with all <hi>artifices</hi> to captate <hi>Magiſtratick favour,</hi> as well as plebeian applauſes, repreſenting themſelves ſo ſubmiſſive and complyant to Princes and Parlaments, to all States and civill Polities, that they fancy to favour their ſide, as if they onely ſtudied to bear <hi>the croſſe of Christ,</hi> and not to <hi>weare</hi> any <hi>Crown</hi> of ſoveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But how modeſt ſome of them have been in ſeeking to ſet up <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi> and <hi>themſelves,</hi> not onely without, but againſt <hi>the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe will and conſent</hi> of the lawfull <hi>Princes</hi> and chief Magiſtrates, no leſſe than againſt the Lawes in force, yea and againſt the far major part of the community of all ſorts, I leave it to others, yea to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to judge, who have any juſt, ingenuous or <hi>bluſhing</hi> principle in them. I am ſure the Anabaptiſts at <hi>Munſter</hi> firſt pretended to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor all wars and weapons of blood, while their party was ſmall, weake and frozen; but afterward they could find hands as well as feet.

Nor is this to be done with <hi>gloves</hi> and <hi>mittens,</hi> with <hi>peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> and <hi>prayers,</hi> but with <hi>gantlets</hi> and <hi>ſpeares,</hi> with <hi>clubs</hi> and <hi>ſwords,</hi> if need be, and if they can get power into their hands; which (they ſay) is to be counted Gods power, or a providentiall diſpenſation to his people, thus to carry on his glory, his word and his cauſe, as to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, though againſt his expreſſe Word, againſt all <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>juſtice,</hi> againſt all Lawes and bounds of civill order and obedience, yea a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>common honeſty,</hi> even to the violating of juſt oathes, and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inducing of perjurious ſuperfetations, yea even to excommunication and deprivation of the chief Magiſtrate or Prince of their place and power, in caſe they be refractory.</p>
               <p>Thus do many men tell us they have found the <hi>Diſciplinarian pulſe of Presbytery</hi> at leaſt, if not of <hi>Independency,</hi> to beat almoſt ever ſince they were born: ſo that they have, and ever will give no ſmall <hi>terror, jealouſie</hi> and <hi>trouble</hi> to all ſoveraigne and Magiſtratick powers, where ever they can by popular arts get <hi>footing</hi>; both of them bearing themſelves high upon the confidence of Chriſts <hi>Scepter, Call</hi> and <hi>Kingdome,</hi> which (they ſay) admits no ſtop, delay or obſtruction, whenever Providence opens a door, not to the Goſpel which is already profeſſed, but to ſuch a Form and way as they like to have it in as to Diſcipline, Government and Church-Order: and this if not to be had by <hi>Princes favour</hi> and <hi>conſent,</hi> yet by the <hi>ſuffrages</hi> and <hi>aſsiſtance</hi> of common people, where they may be had; who in ſuch caſes are not to regard their obedience to any <hi>worldly Princes</hi> or <hi>powers,</hi> who ſtand in oppoſition to, or <hi>competition with Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> or any thing that ſome <hi>godly men</hi> ſhall fancy to be an <hi>ordinance</hi> of his, though never heretofore owned or uſed as ſuch in his Church.

               <p>That theſe have been the principles, and in many places the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours or practiſes of many (for I dare not impute them to all) is not to be doubted, being evident by their <hi>writings,</hi> and the Hiſtories of thoſe who have truly told the world what their ſenſe, agencies and aimes are.

               <p>I well know, it is not to be <hi>denyed</hi> and <hi>diſſembled</hi> what he liberally reports to have been done by ſome <hi>Biſhops,</hi> even in <hi>England,</hi> in the more <hi>pompous</hi> and <hi>ſuperſtitious</hi> times, that were, like <hi>ſtormy nights, blind</hi> and <hi>boyſterous</hi>; when many of them, no leſſe than other men of all ſorts, <hi>Yeomen, Lawyers, Gentlemen, Judges</hi> and <hi>Noblemen,</hi> were violently engaged in thoſe different <hi>intereſts,</hi> either <hi>Secular</hi> or <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall,</hi> which ſet up two <hi>Supremes,</hi> (as two Suns in one firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) either in the Church againſt the State (whereto the <hi>Papall pride</hi> and <hi>ambition</hi> then laid claime, ſeven hundred yeares after Chriſt, by an <hi>uſurpation</hi> and pretention upon Chriſts ſcore too, at leaſt St. <hi>Peters,</hi> not known to the <hi>Primitive Popes,</hi> or other pious <hi>Biſhops,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Rome</hi> or any <hi>other City</hi>) or elſe the diſtractions aroſe in the ſame civil State, by the ſeverall claimes and Titles which <hi>Princes</hi> made to the <hi>Crown</hi> and Soveraignty, occaſioning civill warres either in <hi>England</hi> or elſewhere.</p>

               <p>More veniall and excuſable may thoſe verball reluctancies, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves and refractures (rather than any thing of open force and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile rebellions) ſeem, which ſome <hi>Biſhops</hi> are reported ſometime to have been guilty of here in <hi>Engl.</hi> when they ſuperſtitiouſly aſſerted their diſobedience and inconformities to their <hi>Princes,</hi> upon the point of <hi>conſcience,</hi> and thoſe <hi>religious</hi> perſwaſions which were then very plauſible, and generally admitted both in <hi>England</hi> and all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome, as to the priviledges of the <hi>Popes</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> or of the Churches intereſts and immunities diſtinct or exempt from the Authority of the <hi>Civil State</hi>: which very challenges aroſe not from the ſeditions, treaſons and rebellions of Biſhops and Church-men, as ſuch, but partly from the cunning encrochments of the <hi>Popes</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and partly from the former indulgences of <hi>Princes,</hi> more ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious and eaſie; alſo from the favourable <hi>Lawes</hi> or <hi>Cuſtomes</hi> of the Nation to the Clergy, as men moſt uſefull and <hi>venerable</hi> in their Eccleſiaſtick Authority; which was eſteemed ſacred and Divine, as indeed it is in the right conſtitution and execution of it.</p>
               <p>But no Chriſtian or <hi>Reformed</hi> Biſhop (as ſuch) did ever approve the <hi>ſtubborne</hi> and indeed <hi>inſolent</hi> ſpirit of <hi>Thomas Becket,</hi> Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who was ſlaine as he <hi>was officiating in the Church,</hi> by a <hi>paroxyſme</hi> more blameable in the King, than that was in the Archbiſhop, which made him ſo <hi>ſtiffe</hi> and <hi>refractory</hi> as to his and the Churches ſuppoſed priviledges and immunities.

               <p>Yea, ſo Meek, Moderate, Juſt, Wiſe and Charitable was the zeal of <hi>Primitive Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Church-men,</hi> that they did not by force turne <hi>the Idols</hi> of the <hi>Heathens out of their Temples,</hi> till <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne</hi> and <hi>Imperiall Authority</hi> either commanded or permitted them ſo to do: Nor did they drive out the <hi>Flamens</hi> and <hi>Arch-flamens here in England,</hi> (which were <hi>Idolatrous Prieſts</hi>) till <hi>Princes,</hi> converted by <hi>Biſhops</hi> and other <hi>Preachers of the Goſpel,</hi> did forſake and aboliſh thoſe <hi>lying vanities.</hi> So far were <hi>Biſhops</hi> from obtruding their opinion or party, meerly as to <hi>gubernative order</hi> and power, upon any City, Nation or Kingdom, contrary to the will of the <hi>chief Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate</hi>: nor did they ever turne any lawfull <hi>Prince out of doores,</hi> to make <hi>way for themſelves</hi> and their Epiſcopall Authority or party.</p>

               <p>Nor was this more true piety and charity, than prudence and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, in the Biſhops and other <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the Church, to whom, as to gowned and bookiſh men, and not as to armed <hi>ſouldiers,</hi> doth all the <hi>Christian world</hi> owe (under God) the planting, propagating and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, yea and the due reforming of true Chriſtian Religion.

               <p>Till this may be done, a <hi>thouſand</hi> civil <hi>burthens</hi> and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, yea perſecutions, are eaſier than any ſinful preſumptions; yea, true Religion will be <hi>beautifull</hi> when it is black with perſecution, if then it be <hi>comely</hi> with <hi>patience.

Let men pretend never ſo much to be <hi>Saints, godly,</hi> yea and <hi>inſpired</hi> too, yet, as the pureſt water and the wholſomeſt fleſh, when once they come to feel the heat of <hi>factions,</hi> and begin to boyle up to civil perturbations, they will ſoon diſcover a very <hi>black</hi> fome and <hi>foule</hi> ſcum to riſe in their hearts and actions, which (as <hi>Hazael</hi>) they hardly thought could have been in them, carrying them to injuſtice, immoderation, uncharitableneſſe, preſumption, rebellion, ſacriledge and cruelty, and all unwarrantable actions, before they are <hi>aware</hi> of the folly, falſity or fouleneſſe of their own, as indeed all mens hearts; at whoſe <hi>bottom</hi> lies all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of filth and villany, which is then eaſily and conſtantly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, when they are paſſionately and <hi>inordinately</hi> ſtirred. Nor is it at all to be conſidered how pure men appeare, as to that which is upward or outward in their Religious proteſtations and profeſſions, when once they come to that Romantick and Errant ſpirit, which thinks it as much gallantry to fight for their Religion, as ſome do for their Miſtreſſes beauties, which exceeds quarrelling and killing each other by civil and <hi>heroick murthers,</hi> for no other offence but the glory of their opinion, and the preferring of their fancy.</p>

So did St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> reſpect both <hi>Theodoſius</hi> and <hi>Valentinian</hi>; ſo did the venerable <hi>Council</hi> of the <hi>Nicene Biſhops</hi> reverence the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour Conſtantine</hi> the Great: Neither their number, being <hi>three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred</hi> and <hi>eighteen,</hi> nor their publick repreſentation of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> did encourage them to do or meditate any thing beyond prayers and petitions, recommending all their Counſels to God, the Emperour, and all the Church.

               <p>What wiſe, ſober and humble Chriſtian (then) can ſufficiently love, honour and admire the modeſty, humility and loyalty of true <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> ever expreſſed by the carriage of the beſt Chriſtian and reformed Biſhops <hi>towards all Princes?</hi> And who can ſufficiently ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor the petulancy and inſolency of thoſe Novellers and Reformers, who ſhall dare to lift up either the <hi>Presbyterian virgula,</hi> or the <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent ferula,</hi> or the <hi>Anabaptiſtick flail,</hi> not onely to threaten, but to chaſtiſe <hi>Soveraign Princes,</hi> that liſt not to admit their wayes into

               <p>Surely <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> and the <hi>Clergy</hi> are never ſo healthy and comely, as when their complexion is rather <hi>pallid</hi> with the faſtings and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, the ſtudies and pains of humble Biſhops and Presbyters, than <hi>purpled</hi> or <hi>ſanguine</hi> with <hi>blood</hi> and <hi>fury.</hi>

Godly <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Presbyters</hi> ever abhorred, as Hell and damnation, to teach Princes their Religion, their Canons, Catechiſes and Directories, as <hi>Gideon</hi> did the men of <hi>Succoth,</hi> with <hi>Briars</hi> and <hi>Thornes,</hi> or to diſcipline So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne Majeſty with Swords and Piſtols, in order to perſwade them to ſubmit to the <hi>Goſpel-Scepter</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline.</hi> No, they never did attempt ſo to do, either in the Primitive and perſecuting times, when Magiſtrates were moſt froward and injurious, or in thoſe times which were afterward more propitious and proſperous, when the <hi>Clergy</hi> fed higheſt, and was moſt <hi>indulged</hi> by the munificence of Chriſtian Emperours and Empreſſes, devout <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Queens</hi>; who as good <hi>nurſes</hi> never repined at the fulneſs of their own breaſts, or the hearty ſucking of their dear <hi>nurſlings,</hi> joyning the Prince to the Prelate, and adding Lordly Honors with Eſtates to Chriſtian Biſhops: never fearing hereby to make them too wanton or inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, while they ſaw them keep to the ſober principles of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, conformable to that Apoſtolick and Primitive <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> which was alwaies <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>peaceable,</hi> faithfull to God, humble and loyall to man, ſo Ruling the Church of Chriſt, as not to be Maſters of miſ-rule in any Nation, State or Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Yea, in the <hi>amplest enjoyments</hi> of that pious <hi>munificence,</hi> and thoſe <hi>generous liberalities</hi> which Chriſtian Princes, Noblemen, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen and inferiour perſons devoutly afforded to <hi>Biſhops</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> (as tokens of their gratitude to God, their honor to their <hi>Saviour,</hi> their love to their ſpirituall <hi>Fathers,</hi> and their value of their own and other mens ſoules,) however ſome few <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy-men</hi> among many might (poſſibly) ſurfeit ſometime, and, as <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurun,</hi> grow petulant, ſenſuall and ſottiſh, through fulneſs of bread, idleneſſe and luxury; yet ſtill the generall face of the beſt <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Clergy</hi> was comely and venerable: there wanted not in all Ages ſuch <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Presbyters,</hi> both in <hi>England</hi> and all Churches, for Gravity, Learning, Sanctity, Charity, Fidelity and Loyalty, as kept up the Office, Name and Honor of the Clergy and of <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> to an high degree of honor and veneration both with Princes and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that were good Chriſtians. No men were more uſefull or more imployed for the good ordering both of Church and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weale than Biſhops were: none were better Counſellors to <hi>Princes,</hi> and greater Benefactors to their fellow-ſubjects; none fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from faction, ſedition, popularity, ſacriledge and rebellion;
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:97412:308"/>
none did greater ſervice or better offices for their King, their Church, and their Country.</p>
               <p>How loyal, reſolute and religious a Remonſtrance did the Biſhop of <hi>Carlile</hi> make in Parliament, againſt the <hi>depoſing of King Richard the Second,</hi> when the whole ſtream ran againſt him? Was not <hi>Morton</hi> (firſt <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Ely,</hi> and after of <hi>Canterbury</hi>) the firſt deſigner and a principal effecter of the union of the <hi>White</hi> and <hi>Red Roſes,</hi> the two great houſes of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> to the bleſſed extinguiſhing of thoſe long flames of civil war, which drank up the blood and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed the fleſh of this Nation, whoſe greateſt miſeries riſe from its own bowels? Was not <hi>Richard Fox,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Durham,</hi> the chief <hi>Counſellour, Promoter</hi> and <hi>Actor</hi> of that other union between the two <hi>Crowns</hi> of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> by treating and concluding a match with our King <hi>Henry the Sevenths daughter,</hi> and <hi>James the Fourth King of Scotland</hi>? a foundation certainly of very great honour and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to both Nations, if wiſe and religious ſuperſtructures had been built upon it.

               </p>
               <p>Nor were the <hi>Engliſh Biſhops</hi> leſs loyal to true Religion as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, yea and to the true <hi>Reformation</hi> of it, then to their <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Country.</hi> How notably did that renowned <hi>Lincolnienſis (Groſteſt Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Lincoln)</hi> aſſert the freedom of his Conſcience againſt the Popes unworthy commands? How many other Biſhops, in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts between the Popes and our Princes about Inveſtitures, aſſerted the rights of their <hi>Soveraigns?</hi> After the Roman darkneſs and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny vaniſhed, and the light of an orderly and loyal Reformation appeared, how many godly Biſhops then did abide the fiery Tryal of Martyrdom? How many of them and their Clergy were bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and impriſoned as <hi>Confeſſors?</hi> How many of them, as <hi>Jewel, Abbot, Andrews, Davenant, White, Morton,</hi> and others, have wrote with <hi>incomparable</hi> ſtudy and <hi>unanſwerable</hi> ſtrength againſt the <hi>Papal Uſurpations, Errors</hi> and <hi>Superſtitions</hi>? and none beyond the laſt <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> for clearneſs and exactneſs of the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies ſtated.</p>
               <p>With how great a reſolution and loyal freedom did <hi>George Abbot,</hi> his immediate Predeceſſor, write a notable letter to King <hi>James</hi> againſt all <hi>toleration</hi> of <hi>Popery,</hi> when the <hi>Spaniſh match</hi> was hot in treaty? At which time with what thunder and lightning did Dr. <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>howes,</hi> afterward B. of <hi>Carlile,</hi> preach the two famous Sermons againſt the great <hi>Diana</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> as well as of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> to ſuch a degree of elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent zeal and becoming courage, that he pleaſed even thoſe whom he <hi>offended</hi>? In the very laſt <hi>Convocation in England, anno</hi> 1640. (which gave occaſion to ſo great flames in this Church, meeting with times and minds which had both <hi>wood</hi> and <hi>fire</hi> ready, and onely wanted a <hi>Sacrifice</hi>) even this ſo decryed Synod (which had in it as <hi>learned, honeſt</hi> and <hi>venerable Church-men, Biſhops</hi> and others, as ever
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:97412:309"/>
were in <hi>England</hi>) had among <hi>other things</hi> concluded a full and firme defiance againſt <hi>Popery</hi> for ever, as well as an eſtabliſhment for <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopacy,</hi> which they then found tottering and ſhaken, but had not the happineſs to uſe the right means of eſtabliſhing it; which was not by building it a ſtory higher, but by taking it rather a ſtory lower, at leaſt abating its Pinnacles, Turrets and Battlements; what it wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in ornament and height, it might have enjoyed in ſtrength and ſetledneſs. Yet their deſign and endeavour was very prudent, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing, as was eaſie, that the <hi>overthrow</hi> of Epiſcopacy in the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Church of <hi>England,</hi> would be the greateſt gratification to <hi>Rome</hi> that could be at preſent expected by the Papiſts. And certainly the Romiſh party were never more pleaſed then with thoſe <hi>Convulſion-fits,</hi> which ſo tortured firſt, and afterward deſtroyed, not onely that <hi>Convocation,</hi> but all the former Stability, Honour, Peace, Plenty, Order and Government of this <hi>Church</hi> and its <hi>Clergy</hi>; which alwayes feared and foretold no leſs danger from <hi>Scylla</hi> then <hi>Charybdis.</hi> I might adde further the humble, yet reſolute, <hi>Remonſtrance</hi> made by the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> to the <hi>Governours</hi> and <hi>Councel</hi> of that Kingdom, in the <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>Straffords</hi> time, fully and freely declaring the <hi>inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtency</hi> of any open and avowed <hi>toleration of Popery</hi> with the honour of God, with the power and purity of the Reformed Religion, and with the peace of the Kingdoms.</p>
               <p>Thus when the Biſhops of <hi>England</hi> were <hi>Capital</hi> or <hi>Dominical</hi> letters both in the Church and State, their Piety, Loyalty, Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, Zeal and Conſtancy made (I think) as fair and as goodly aſhew as any of their enemies have done; they were legible afar off, at home and abroad, and will be ſo to preſent and after-Ages: many an <hi>one</hi> of them ſignified more, as to exemplary Piety and uſeful Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, then one <hi>hundred</hi> of petty Presbyters or puny Preachers either then did, or now do, or ever will be able to do; who were indeed never ſo conſiderable or commendable, ſo uſeful to the Church, or ſerviceable to the State, as when they kept to an humble ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and wiſe communion with their Biſhops, whoſe honour and peace was the Presbyters honour, as the honour of the head is the honour of every member of that Body. Doubtleſs their temporal happineſs was bound up together; neither could Biſhops be happy without the aſſiſtance of venerable Presbyters, nor Presbyters with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the governance of reverend Biſhops; neither ſhould be without other in the Lords Church.</p>
               <p>I might here further adde to the conſideration of the obedienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and peaceable principles and practiſes of true <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> its Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable, Hoſpitable and Generous diſpoſition, which are beſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in times of peace and a ſtate of plenty. As Biſhops had a firm loyalty to their Princes, and obedience for conſcience ſake to their ſuperiours, not examining their morall vertues, but their civil Rights, which are the onely meaſures of duty; in like manner Biſhops had generally great <hi>charity</hi> to their equals, and benignity to ther inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours: which is a great fruit of a ſubjects loyalty to his Prince, and
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:97412:309"/>
love to his Country, relieving many poor people in their preſſures, and thereby keeping them from thoſe diſcontents which uſually attend the diſtreſſes of mens conditions; the afflictions of Princes oft riſing from the duſt, the meaner ſort of people, when neceſſities animate them to animoſities, and ſuch inſolencies as turne duſt into lice, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did to the plaguing of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and all <hi>Egypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>None but evil eyes, and worſe hearts, could with unthankfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and uncharitableneſſe <hi>grudge</hi> the excellent <hi>Biſhops</hi> of England thoſe <hi>Honors</hi> and <hi>Revenues</hi> which they highly deſerved, while they worthily employed them rather for others good than their own private enjoyments, in any way of luxury, or gallantry, or debauche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; the frequent gulfs of many other mens great Eſtates and Honors, when they are enjoyed and abuſed by very ſmall and ſenſuall minds. Generally Biſhops neglected their own private intereſts and gaine to advance the publick. How few of them, in many yeares of peace and plenty, raiſed any conſiderable <hi>fortunes</hi> to their <hi>particular fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies</hi> or poſterities? I am ſure not comparable to what Judges and Lawyers in all Ages, yea and Military men have done in a few yeares, whoſe <hi>thrifty ſwords</hi> have gathered better Eſtates in one ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven yeare, than any Biſhops or other Church-mens <hi>liberall words</hi> and works ever did or aimed at in twenty yeares, though their yearly Revenues were as good, or better, I think, than moſt <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders</hi> pay, and I conceive as much deſerved by them, in order to the publick good and ſervice, which they might do and really did in all Ages, both as to Church and State, to Superiours, Equals and Inferiours.</p>
               <p>For Biſhops, beyond all men in their times, were guilty of build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing repairing and endowing <hi>many Churches,</hi> which other men pull down and rob, buy and ſell, ſquander and embezell. Biſhops, beſides their temporary, daily and occaſionall bounty, founded and erected many coſtly works of <hi>durable</hi> and <hi>Monumentall</hi> Charity, in <hi>Colledges, Libraries, Free-Schooles, Hoſpitals, Almes-Houſes,</hi> and the like: many noble endowments they began, many they encreaſed, many they perfected, to Gods glory, the Nations Honor, the incouragement of Learning and Religion, as well as the relief of many <hi>poor people.</hi> They took as much pleaſure in their works of <hi>Charity,</hi> as others can do in their <hi>ſacriledge</hi> or <hi>robbery</hi>; taking away thoſe things from the Church, and all religious uſes, to which neither they nor any of their <hi>progenitors</hi> ever gave one <hi>farthing:</hi> for they are commonly perſons of the <hi>meanest blood</hi> and <hi>ignobleſt deſcents,</hi> as well as minds and manners, who are moſt repiners at the <hi>Churches patrimony,</hi> which all perſons of generous piety both feare and abhor to do, knowing that thoſe <hi>penurious</hi> practiſes and <hi>ſacrilegious</hi> principles which ſome men follow, are as much Antievangelicall as they are <hi>Antiepiſcopall,</hi> againſt Chriſt and his Goſpel, as much as againſt the Clergy and true Chriſtian Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: It being impoſſible than Chriſtian or Reformed Religion ſhould ever flouriſh, except by miracle (as <hi>Aarons</hi> dry <hi>Rod</hi> did, when
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:97412:310"/>
it was nouriſhed by no earth or dew) when the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of it are ſuch <hi>diminutives,</hi> kept alwaies in a <hi>mendicant Minority,</hi> and in a <hi>plebeian parity,</hi> as well as <hi>poverty</hi>; when Paſtors of the Church are ſo pittifully penurious and inconſpicuous, that they are alwaies dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven like vermine to be creeping and biting, crying and whining, craving and coveting, crouching and complaining, rather than giving or diſtributing any thing with charity and cheerfulneſſe to men, or conſecrating any free-will offering to God, the Church, and their Country.</p>
               <p>O how perfect a Bleſſing, how complete a Reformation, how Triumphant a Church, how glorious a Miniſtry, how pretious Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants muſt there needs be then in <hi>England,</hi> when the viſible order, ſociall beauty, politick harmony and ancient Government of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion being firſt deprived of all honors and ampleneſſes, Miniſters are reduced to meanneſſe and tenuity, either wholly ſcattered into fragments of <hi>Independency,</hi> or molded up in the <hi>Maſſe</hi> and <hi>Chaos</hi> of <hi>Presbytery</hi>; where every Miniſters principle and practiſe muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily tend either to <hi>rule</hi> in <hi>Common,</hi> or elſe to rend from the <hi>Community</hi>; where there ſhall be no further motive to any Loyalty, Subjection and Peaceableneſſe, than what either the terror and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of others power, or the tenuity and paucity of their own party and ſides, impoſeth upon ſuch Miniſters and their various Sectators, who thus <hi>levelled,</hi> or <hi>ravelled,</hi> or <hi>hudled</hi> up without any due <hi>Subordination</hi> to <hi>Eccleſiaſticall Governours</hi> of any Eminency or Authority, muſt needs ſow all ſeeds of Faction, Sedition, civil Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and Diſloyalty toward civil Magiſtrates, whatever Title or Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty they affect to be clothed withall! They cannot avoid to be alwaies expoſed to and exerciſed with their peoples mutuall emulations, contrarieties, contradictions and contempts, which are raiſed and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed upon the ſcore of different Teachers and Religious diſputes; for the determining of which there are no men of venerable worth and conſpicuity appointed, ſuch as Biſhops and Synods of old were in all Ages.</p>
               <p>Men cannot long have a <hi>conſciencious regard</hi> to <hi>Civil Governours,</hi> when either they have not or they will not endure any <hi>Eccleſiasticall.</hi> They that ſee nothing deſerving honor, love and ſubmiſſion to a Worthy, Learned, Grave and Godly Biſhop, will hardly ſee much in any <hi>Juſtice, Judge</hi> or <hi>Prince</hi>; eſpecially when Duty, Obedience and Fidelity ſhall be meaſured by mens <hi>parties</hi> and <hi>opinions</hi> in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, by their civil and ſecular intereſts: which is alwaies expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from any people that affect irregular liberties and formidable freedomes in any Church or State.</p>
               <p>As Princes that ever have been Epiſcopal do hardly ſuite with the novelties and intruſions of either Presbytery or Independency; ſo tis certain, <hi>Presbyterian Preachers</hi> will as hardly comply with an <hi>Epiſcopall</hi> or an <hi>Independent Prince</hi> as with a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> and the like may be imagined of <hi>Independents</hi>; when neither of them enduring any order or ſubjection as to Religious polity, beyond their own fancy,
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:97412:310"/>
muſt needs be leſſe pliable to that obedience which is legal and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, eſpecially when it is exacted by thoſe Princes that are not of their perſwaſion and way. Nor can there be indeed any aptitude in ſuch mens <hi>ſpirits</hi> or <hi>tempers</hi> to any ſtability of loyalty, when their very conjunctions are like the firſt confuſed concretion of all things, rather an heap of contraries or novelties daily emerging, than a compoſure of any noble, orderly and conſtant harmony in Religion: which is never to be expected where there muſt ever be either a combination of folly and faction, of juvenility and ſimplicity onely; (none being admitted to ſome confederacies that do not firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce much of their Learning and Reading, if they have any, or of their credit and eſteem as to all Ancient Churches) or elſe, like <hi>lumps</hi> of <hi>yce,</hi> they muſt be compacted and governed as it hits, by Gravity and Levity, by Age and Youth, by Weakneſſe and Ability, by Steadineſs and Giddineſs, by Raſhneſſe and Warineſs, by Paſſion and Judgement, by Prudence and Confidence, by Modeſty and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence, Hemp and Silk, Courſe and Fine, Linnen and Woollen, being twiſted and jumbled together; theſe at the beſt muſt make up the aſſociating and fluctuating methods of any levelled Miniſtry: or elſe they muſt be like ſand and ſtones without lime, rather caſt into ſeverall little heaps, than built up in a joynt and grand fabrick, by juſt Rules, Orders and proportions truly edifying; when there ſhall be nothing of Authority among Miniſters proportionate to the different Ages, Capacities, Gifts, or Offices and Merits of any of them, (which make up the true harmony of <hi>Government and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Majeſty of all Authority,</hi>) but all things of Religious and Church-order muſt be left in ſuch a popular and plebeian poſture, as ſhall moſt incourage whatever is moſt <hi>Turbulent, Factious, Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> and <hi>Rebellious</hi> in any mens ſpirits, who will be prone either to <hi>affect</hi> more <hi>Rule</hi> than is their due, or elſe be <hi>impatient</hi> that any ſhould govern them in Church or State <hi>further than they list,</hi> or think is agreeable to thoſe <hi>principles</hi> and perſwaſions of <hi>Religion</hi> or <hi>Reformation</hi> which they ſtrongly fancy to themſelves, and aime as ſtrongly to ſet up and impoſe on others when they ſhall be able, not by the approbation and permiſſion of the <hi>chief Magistrate</hi> onely, where it may be fairly had, but in caſe he be ſo <hi>blind, wilfull, obſtinate</hi> and <hi>unconvertible,</hi> (as ſome have been for <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> againſt <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery</hi>) they will find <hi>a call from God,</hi> and ſome <hi>ſpeciall impulſives</hi> to obtrude their opinions and deſignes, without, yea againſt the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe will of the <hi>Soveraigne Governour</hi>; whoſe <hi>obstinacy</hi> againſt any ſuch ſuppoſed waies of God, and pretended <hi>Diſcipline of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> is thought by many a ſufficient <hi>Abſolution</hi> and <hi>Diſpenſation</hi> from their civil <hi>Loyalty, Oathes</hi> and <hi>Subjection.</hi> Thus looking for God <hi>in fires and Earth-quakes</hi> of civil combuſtions, they loſe him, who is beſt to be found in the <hi>Evangelicall</hi> and <hi>ſtill voyce,</hi> to which the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Prophets</hi> of the Jewiſh, alſo the <hi>Apostles,</hi> with their ſucceſſors the Godly <hi>Biſhops,</hi> of the Chriſtian Churches, have alwaies liſtned, and generally obeyed; judging nothing more <hi>diametrally diſtant</hi>

As Chriſtian Kings and Queenes have ever been, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Gods promiſe, the moſt indulgent, liberall and tender <hi>nurſes of the Church of Christ in all Countries,</hi> every where retaining and reverencing <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> as moſt agreeable <hi>with their Soveraignty</hi> and <hi>Monarchy</hi>; ſo have all true <hi>Chriſtian Biſhops,</hi> in all Ages and places, ever been the moſt <hi>Learned Aſſertors</hi> of, and the <hi>humble ſubmitters to, Soveraigne</hi> and <hi>Monarchical</hi> Authority of Princes, and no leſſe to that of <hi>Ariſtocracy</hi> in <hi>Common-weales</hi> or <hi>Republiques,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Florence</hi> was, and <hi>Venice</hi> ſtill is; who never yet ſaw any reaſon of State to move them to change the ancient and honorable Government of Catholick <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> for any other, which hath, as more of parity, popularity and poverty, ſo leſſe of honeſt policy, firm peace and religious loyalty. Certainly a Chriſtian Prince or State that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes ſtability to their power and peace, will need theſe two ſwords, of <hi>Soveraignty</hi> and <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> to keep himſelf, his people, and his Church ſafe. A wiſe Governour cannot but ſee and ſay of <hi>Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy,</hi> compared to all other formes, as <hi>David ſaid of Goliahs ſword,</hi> there is none like that, in reſpect of its <hi>principles, operations</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences,</hi> as to religious loyalty and publick tranquillity. The loyalty and civil <hi>ſubjection</hi> of all <hi>novellers</hi> ſeemes to be with ſo many ſalvo's and reſerves of godlineſſe and grace, of Religion, Chriſts Diſcipline or true Church-waies, of <hi>Princes</hi> not being tyrants or <hi>perſecutors</hi> in their ſubjects ſenſe, that there is little certainty, much lubricity, and as many dangers as eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.

               <p>As for other Chriſtians of looſer <hi>Conſciences</hi> and <hi>Converſation,</hi> which were prone in all Ages to be as weeds in the garden of the Church, (eſpecially in times of Peace, Plenty and Proſperity) the <hi>piety</hi> and <hi>wiſdom</hi> of <hi>Chriſtian Princes</hi> and other godly people ever took care to keep them in the <hi>more awe</hi> and <hi>reverence</hi> toward their <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Governours,</hi> by inveſting theſe in ſuch out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and viſible <hi>enjoyments</hi> for <hi>eſtate</hi> and <hi>honour,</hi> which might adde ſome outward <hi>reſpect</hi> and <hi>authority</hi> to them, (and that no <hi>ſmall one</hi>) before thoſe that had moſt need to be ſo reſtrained, overawed and dazled.

               <p>I may further adde, to convince my <hi>Brethren the Ministers,</hi> and all my worthy Countrymen, how <hi>agreeable</hi> and <hi>honourable Epiſcopacy,</hi> in its due place, poſture &amp; authority, was to the <hi>genius of Engl.</hi> by putting them in mind of that vaſt diſproportion, for Love, Reſpect, Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, Maintenance, Encouragement and Honor, which now are paid, as generally to the function of the Miniſtry, ſo particularly to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of any Miniſter, of whatever <hi>quality</hi> or <hi>preferment, title</hi> or <hi>party he be,</hi> comparing things to what the deſerving <hi>Clergy</hi> generally enjoyed heretofore, while, under <hi>God</hi> and their <hi>Kings,</hi> their <hi>worthy Biſhops</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected them according to Law in well-doing. Heretofore (even in my memory) a <hi>grave, learned</hi> and <hi>godly Biſhop</hi> was as the <hi>centre</hi> of his <hi>Dioceſe,</hi> the <hi>tutelary Angel</hi> of his <hi>Clergy,</hi> the good genius of every able and faithful Miniſter under him: He was the grand <hi>Oracle</hi> of the honeſt Gentry, the honoured <hi>Father</hi> and ghoſtly <hi>Counſeller</hi> of the true-hearted <hi>Nobility</hi>; he was the admiration and veneration of the moſt plain-hearted and peaceful Common-people. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the <hi>ſcurrilous obloquies</hi> and <hi>affronts</hi> which ſometimes either weak or wicked, fooliſh or factious men ſought to caſt upon all <hi>Biſhops</hi> and all the Clergy under them, yet ſtill the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Parlaments,</hi> the favour of <hi>Princes,</hi> the worth of good <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,</hi> the diſcretion of wiſe <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and above all the goodneſs of a <hi>gracious God,</hi> kept the Clergy of <hi>England</hi> in ſuch a condition as was rather to be envied than pittied. No Miniſter of any worth was then ſo <hi>cheap</hi> &amp; <hi>deſpicable,</hi> ſo <hi>obvious</hi> to injuries, and <hi>obnoxious</hi> to all indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, as now he is, no not by an <hi>hundred degrees.</hi> Every grave and good Miniſter in his place then moved as wheels in an <hi>Engine,</hi> by that <hi>concurrent ſtrength</hi> which then was in the whole Fabrick &amp; Jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of the Church: the beams of Epiſcopal honor <hi>ſhined</hi> on the meaneſt Clergy-man, whoſe own <hi>fatuity</hi> or <hi>factiouſneſſe, weakneſſe</hi> or <hi>wickedneſſe</hi> did not obſcure him.

               <p>Beyond this, how great a luſtre (I beſeech you) was added by the <hi>piety</hi> and <hi>generoſity</hi> of the Engliſh-Nation to all the <hi>Clergy,</hi> when ſome of the Biſhops were taken into the Privy <hi>Counſell of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> when all the <hi>Biſhops</hi> had the places and priviledges of <hi>Peers</hi> in <hi>Parlament,</hi> having temporall Baronies; yea when the <hi>whole Clergy</hi> in their Repreſentees had place and power in <hi>Convocation,</hi> both to conſult of all things <hi>Eccleſiaſticall,</hi> and to give of their own <hi>Spirituall Eſtates</hi> a free-will-offering to the publick <hi>Treaſury?</hi> Theſe and ſuch like marks of publick <hi>conſpicuity</hi> looked indeed like the beams of <hi>honor</hi> upon the Clergy, making their faces to ſhine before the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people.</hi> This poſture of the Clergy was manly, <hi>generous, heroick,</hi> becoming the Honor and Piety of the Nation, worthy of the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence of Chriſtian Princes, of the Devotion of Chriſtian Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, of the Learning and Merit of ſo excellent a Clergy and Chriſtian Miniſtry as <hi>England</hi> enjoyed; which (of all <hi>profeſsions</hi>) in any Nation ſhould be leaſt Eclipſed, and moſt illuſtrated with the tokens of publick reſpect, becauſe no men have to encounter with ſo many <hi>Devils</hi> of <hi>diſdain</hi> and <hi>Spirits</hi> of <hi>oppoſition</hi> in private breaſts, as good <hi>Miniſters</hi> have, if they will be <hi>friends</hi> to mens ſoules, and <hi>foes</hi> to their ſins.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the laſt place, I do with the more courage and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence recommend the cauſe of <hi>Venerable Epiſcopacy</hi> to my <hi>honored Countrymen,</hi> becauſe no Nation or Church under heaven ever had more ample and conſtant expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences of that <hi>excellent worth</hi> which hath been in their <hi>Biſhops,</hi> or of that <hi>excellent uſe</hi> which hath ever been made of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> both in reſpect of true Piety and Orderly Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy.</p>
               <p>I know it will at <hi>firſt daſh</hi> with full mouth be here replyed, how <hi>many Biſhops</hi> have been <hi>ſuperſtitious, ſottiſh, luxurious, tyrannous perſecutors,</hi> and what not? eſpecially before the Reformation, till their wings were ſo clipped that they could not be ſo bad as they would; yet ſome of them were bad enough.</p>
               <p>My anſwer is, I do not undertake to juſtifie every thing that <hi>every Biſhop</hi> hath done in any Age, late or long ſince: though I am charitably modeſt to palliate the <hi>ſhame</hi> or uncomlineſs of my <hi>Fathers,</hi> yet I am no <hi>Mercenary Orator</hi> or <hi>veneall Advocate</hi> to plead for their enormities, which are in no men leſſe tolerable or expiable. There were (no doubt) among <hi>Biſhops,</hi> as well as other men of all ſorts, ſome weak, ſome wicked; as <hi>Ezekiels</hi> figs, ſome very good, ſome very bad: yet take them in the generall view and aſpect, even in the darkeſt times, I am ſure they were in <hi>England</hi> ever eſteemed and employed both in <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> as <hi>Primores Regni,</hi> men of the greateſt abilities and beſt repute for Learning, Wiſdome, Counſel, Piety, Charity and Hoſpitality in all the Nation; nor were many of them in thoſe times inferiour by birth and breeding to the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt <hi>Noblemen</hi> in the Land.

               <p>So is it in point of <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi>; notwithſtanding that many <hi>Biſhops</hi> were but men, yet ſome, yea many, nay I hope the moſt of them (eſpecially ſince the Reformation) were as <hi>Mortall Angels, Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Paſtors</hi> and <hi>Venerable Fathers.</hi> There are upon account reckoned up by <hi>Biſhop Godwin</hi> and others 1479. <hi>Biſhops</hi> in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> for above 1100. yeares; of which time ſome Hiſtories remaine, though <hi>Biſhops</hi> were long before; but of theſe there are ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords both before and ſince the Reformation.

               <p>This is certaine, that till theſe laſt <hi>tempeſtuous times, Biſhops</hi> in <hi>England</hi> had given ſo ample and conſtant experiments of their Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, Piety, Worth and Uſefulneſs in all Ages and States, for Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall and Civil Affaires, that they did abundantly <hi>conciliate</hi> and <hi>conſerve</hi> thoſe great meaſures of <hi>Love, Reſpect, Honour</hi> and <hi>Eſtate,</hi> both publick and private, which their Perſons and Function by Law enjoyed: Inſomuch that as there were no where to be found better <hi>Biſhops,</hi> ſo no where had they better entertainment, before and ſince the <hi>Reformation,</hi> while they enjoyed the favour of <hi>Princes</hi> and the love of <hi>Parlaments</hi>; who never heretofore liſtned to the plebeian envy or petulancy of thoſe who ſometime petitioned and prated againſt <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> as <hi>Diotrephes</hi> did againſt St. <hi>John.</hi> The Wiſdome, Gravity, Piety and Honor of this <hi>Nation</hi> never thought it worthy of them to overthrow ſo Venerable, ſo Uſefull, ſo Ancient, ſo Catholick, ſo Honorable an Order, meerly to gratifie the peeviſhneſſe, or paſſion, or revenge, or diſcontent, or ambition, or envy of <hi>inferiour people</hi> or <hi>inferiour Presbyters</hi>; who were at their beſt every way, when kept in <hi>compaſſe</hi> by <hi>wiſe Biſhops.</hi>

               <p>Thus riveted was the Kings <hi>Conſcience</hi> to <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> unable, upon any terms, till convinced not by Arms but Arguments, to conſent to the utter <hi>extirpation</hi> of it; although he <hi>offered</hi> &amp; <hi>condeſcended</hi> to many <hi>moderations,</hi> which were from him as much in vain, (for nothing but

               <p>A ſtate of <hi>Church-religion</hi> and <hi>Reformation</hi> which his Majeſty ſaw was at preſent, and was ever likely to be, far diſtant from that which was enjoyed in <hi>England</hi> under his <hi>Princely Predeceſſors,</hi> and in ſome part of his own reign, when <hi>England</hi> was filled and overflowed with good Chriſtians, good Scholars, good Presbyters and good Biſhops; of which <hi>order England</hi> ever afforded, and ſpecially ſince the <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi> ſo many learned and commendable, yea ſome rare and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable inſtances: Inſomuch that this Church had cauſe to envie none in the World, ancient or modern, as for other things, ſo for this, the bleſſing of <hi>excellent Biſhops,</hi> as well as orderly <hi>Presbyters</hi> and ſincere <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed no Nation for many <hi>Ages</hi> (if we may feel the temper of <hi>any people</hi> by the <hi>pulſe of their Parlaments</hi>) either had more cauſe, or ſeemed to have more diſpoſition to value, and actually did <hi>venerate,</hi> its excellent Biſhops, than <hi>England</hi> did: yea, I have known thoſe <hi>Noblemen, Gentlemen, Miniſters</hi> and other people, who were, as to ſome <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> leſs ſatisfied or more <hi>ſcrupulous</hi> than the Church and State was, yet theſe men how have they commended, how courted, how almoſt adored ſuch Biſhops as they thought godly and grave, good Preachers and good Livers, as well as good Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours?

                  <note place="margin">About the year 1375.</note> as that brave man <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> of <hi>Sudbury,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> was, whom the <hi>rabble</hi> at ſeven or eight blowes hacked in pieces.

Such was the caſe of <hi>thoſe Biſhops</hi> at that time, when they not onely fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied, but actually found, promiſcuous and rude heapes of people, not onely threatning, but offering indignities to their <hi>perſons</hi> as well as to their <hi>place</hi> and <hi>function</hi>; through whoſe ſides they ſaw the malice and inſolency of ſuch <hi>Riotous Reformers</hi> ſought to ſtrike at the whole <hi>frame</hi> and conſtitution of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> which they, as all good men, had great cauſe to value more than their lives, if they might lay them down in an orderly &amp; <hi>deliberate way,</hi> not in a <hi>tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary</hi> and confuſed faſhion.

               <p>I confeſſe I cannot tell how to anſwer for all the actions and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of <hi>every Biſhop</hi>; they were of age,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> and able to have anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for themſelves, if any of them as offendors of our Lawes had been brought to plead for themſelves, which not one of them was, as to <hi>Eccleſiasticall</hi> matters, that I ever heard of; for the weight of the <hi>Archbiſhops</hi> charge was chiefly upon civil or ſecular affaires.</p>
               <p>Who knowes not that <hi>Biſhops</hi> were but men? that if left to their private ſpirits and ſingle Counſels, they might as eaſily over or under-do, as their Adverſaries have done, beyond or ſhort of

what becomes wiſe and good men? The greateſt blame that I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive among any of them, was, that they would injoyne, or exact, or remit any thing as to publick Order, Diſcipline and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church, without a joynt agreement and uniformity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves, according to what the Law allowed or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. This fraternall concurrence and mutuall correſpondence had been worthy of Grave, Wiſe and Learned men: for all private <hi>fancies</hi> obtruded by any one or two <hi>Biſhops</hi> in ſo tender a caſe as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is, and upon ſo <hi>touchy a people</hi> as the Engliſh now are, do but breed variety, this differences, theſe diſputes, theſe diſſentions, theſe deſpites, theſe oppoſitions, theſe breed confuſions.

               <p>But as to the <hi>crimination,</hi> That Biſhops, like <hi>Hernſhaws,</hi> abounded in the wing and feather of Ceremony, but had little ſubſtance or body as to the <hi>power of Godlineſſe</hi>: Firſt, <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Christs example</hi> teach us, that decent and apt Ceremonies, publick or private, are not in their nature <hi>enemies,</hi> but <hi>helps,</hi> to the <hi>power of Godlineſſe</hi>; as putting off all Ornaments, eating the bread of Sorrow, putting on Sackcloth and Aſhes, Faſting, Weeping, Smiting the breaſt, Bowing, Kneeling, Proſtrating to the ground, being all night in So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude and Darkneſs, lying in the Duſt, &amp;c. all theſe were and are helps to an <hi>humble, broken, contrite, penitent</hi> and <hi>devout temper of Soul.</hi> Contrary, Company, Wine and Oyle, Singing and Muſick, Dancing, Diſcourſe and Laughter, were and are helps to <hi>holy joy</hi> and <hi>thankful jubilations</hi>; ſo are lifting up the eyes and hands to Heaven, Sighing and Groning, to <hi>fervency of Prayer</hi> and <hi>Praiſes.</hi> It is but a rude, affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and fanatick imagination of <hi>clowniſh Chriſtians,</hi> that decent Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies of Religion, wiſely appointed in any Church, or fitly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by any private Chriſtian in his private devotions, theſe cannot ſtand, but the ſubſtance and ſincerity of Godlineſs muſt fall; that there can be no <hi>forms of Godlineſſe,</hi> but the power of it muſt <hi>vaniſh</hi> or be <hi>baniſhed.</hi> They may as well imagine, that they cannot put on their <hi>clothes,</hi> or <hi>dreſſe</hi> themſelves handſomly, but they muſt preſently ceaſe to be wiſe men, or honeſt men and good women, but muſt turn either <hi>ſpectres</hi> or diſhoneſt.

Who are more vain bablers and endleſs janglers, who more unholy, unjuſt, uncharitable, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merciful, implacable, immoderate in their paſſions, preſumptions and revenges, than many of thoſe who have moſt <hi>ſtript</hi> themſelves, as to their Religion, of their clothes and coverings, that they may <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie

               <p>Certainly, the <hi>power of Godlineſſe</hi> is moſt ſeen, when men having moſt power in their hand to do good or evil, do chuſe the good and refuſe the evil. No men were more gracious and ſpirituall, none did more <hi>good,</hi> than many of the <hi>Biſhops</hi> of <hi>England</hi> in their proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, both publickly and privately; yea no men have ſuffered more evil in their adverſity with more <hi>ſilence</hi> and <hi>patience.</hi> They onely once cryed out, when they durſt not go to the <hi>Parlament</hi> by Land, and going by water, they were, with St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> aſſaulted on the ſhore with a ſhowre of ſtones, and could not land with ſafety of their lifes: Since that time, though fleeced and flayed, yet they have <hi>held their peace</hi> under the ſhearers hands, both ſingly and ſocially, as far as ever I have heard or read. It is no great ſign of the power of <hi>Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> that men can endure no power, civil or Eccleſiaſtick, but in their own hands, and think no power is of God which other men lawfully enjoy.</p>
               <p>Since <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> and <hi>Liturgy,</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> and <hi>conſtant Catechizings,</hi> and <hi>all uniform celebration of Sacraments</hi> are diſcarded; ſince nothing but <hi>Miniſters</hi> private breaſts and brains muſt ſerve the Church, with their formed or informed, conſtant or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary <hi>conceptions,</hi> Praying, and Preaching, and Celebrating; is the <hi>power of Godlineſſe,</hi> as to true <hi>grace,</hi> or the <hi>fruits of the Spirit,</hi> much advanced? Is there more conſtant hearing of ſound Doctrine? Is there more of ſober and ſetled Knowledge? Is there more Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, Humility, Equity, Charity, Obedience, Unity, Proficiency, Patience, Love and Fear of God, or Reverence of Man, or Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Duty to both, than was formerly? If theſe Antiepiſcopal men (who ſo much pretend to the bare ſword of the Spirit, that they ſcorn to wear any ſcabbard of <hi>Form</hi> or <hi>Ceremony</hi>) have with <hi>Saul</hi> utterly deſtroyed the <hi>Amalekites</hi> of Immorality and Hypocriſie, what means the bleating, crying, complaining, biting and devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of one another which are among us? what mean the facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, diviſions, envies, animoſities among both Miniſters and People? what means the contempt of the Word of God, of all publick Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and of the beſt Miniſters, who are moſt able, moſt humble, and moſt conſtant? what means the Uncatechiſedneſs, the Sottiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Profaneneſs, Impudence and Irreligion which are ſo much ſpreading and prevailing? How many rich and poor people neither have, nor care for, any Preachers at all? No Sermons, no Prayers, no Catechiſes, no Sacraments, no Morals, no Civilities almoſt are left among them. All the Religion of many is reſolved into diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and denying Tithes, into paying their Taxes, into the fear of Souldiers, the Sword and Laws, the Priſons and Gallowſes or Men; laſtly, into enjoying what liberties or looſneſs in Religion they fancy beſt, as far and as long as they liſt.

now than there were under <hi>Biſhops?</hi> I trow not; ſcarce the half part for number, &amp; ſcarce the half part ſo able for Learning as they were heretofore: as our <hi>Timber</hi> for <hi>great Oaks,</hi> ſo our <hi>Miniſtry</hi> in <hi>England</hi> for grave <hi>Divines,</hi> is much waſted. Whatever the matter was and is, I am ſure, if it was not the Wiſdom and Piety of Biſhops, it was the undeſerved <hi>Bleſsing</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> that made the <hi>power of Godlineſſe,</hi> in ſound Knowledge, Humility, Faith, Repentance, Love of God, Juſtice and Charity to men, in unity amongſt Chriſtians, in good Lives and <hi>good Works,</hi> appear much more to me and others under <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> than ever it hath done ſince its diſſolution. Undoubtedly, true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, both as to its profeſſion and power, as Chriſtian and as Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, as oppoſite to Profaneneſs and to Popiſh Superſtition, did, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the generality of the Nation, both <hi>Nobility, Gentry</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> thrive better when it fed on the <hi>pults</hi> and <hi>water</hi> (as ſome eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the <hi>Liturgy, good Catechizing, ſound Preaching, frequent Communicating,</hi> and <hi>orderly Governing</hi> under Biſhops) than ſince it hath fed of other <hi>mens dainties,</hi> who left a lean Church and Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, while they have been filled with Kings and Biſhops portions. The garden of Chriſts Church was much ſafer and better among thoſe <hi>Ceremonious Briars</hi> and <hi>Thorns</hi> (as ſome count them, yet good ſenſes of religious Order and Honour) under Epiſcopacy, than ſince it hath been laid ſo open and wilde, without ancient <hi>boundaries</hi> or <hi>defences.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, poor <hi>Miniſters</hi> (even all upon the point) have no authority among the Common-people, but what is precarious and deſpicable, which people contemn, caſt and kick off as they liſt, unleſs ſo far as a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier may perchance ſmile upon a Preacher.</p>

For their Court-Complying, they had been very ingratefull men, if they had not owned with all loyall reſpect and ſervice the fountaine of their Honor and Eſtates; yet good men could not love their King without loving their Country, nor their Country without their King; which all godly and honeſt Biſhops did: if any others did not, why did not Juſtice ſeparate between the <hi>good</hi> and the <hi>bad,</hi> the <hi>precious</hi> and the <hi>vile?</hi> Why ſhould good Biſhops, yea and good <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> it ſelf, ſuffer?

               <p>With theſe dark foiles and deep ſhadowes hath the brightneſſe of our <hi>best Biſhops</hi> been ſet off to after-Ages. O what admiration, what aſtoniſhment, what horror will there be, when <hi>impartiall Poſterity</hi> ſhall read, together with their excellent writings, the plentifull po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verties, the illuſtrious obſcurities, the honorable contempts, with which the <hi>excellent Biſhops</hi> of theſe <hi>Britiſh Churches</hi> have been at laſt rewarded; even then when indefatigable ſtudies, incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble endowments and holy <hi>improvements,</hi> had both fitted them for and preferred them to thoſe honorable <hi>imployments, rewards</hi> and encouragements, which they lawfully obtained and worthily enjoyed! being perſons for their Graces and Gifts, for their Learning and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for their Gravity and Prudence, much more worthy (if God had ſeen fit) to have been continued in their <hi>Golden Candleſticks,</hi> and to have ſhined to their laſt in this Church, than to have been ſo ſhut up in <hi>dark lanternes,</hi> or to be put under ſuch <hi>buſhels</hi> as not onely hide, but quite extinguiſh their <hi>perſonall</hi> and publick <hi>luſtre</hi>; ſo bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying, as much as may be, while they are yet alive, <hi>their excellent abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,</hi> which did not conſiſt onely in good <hi>preaching,</hi> but alſo wiſe <hi>Governing</hi> their Churches, in keeping both Miniſters and people in good <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Unity,</hi> in being not onely Monitors and Fatherly Correctors, but <hi>Refuges</hi> and <hi>Defences</hi> to their Clergy and others, as <hi>Fathers</hi> to <hi>Sons,</hi> in ordaining and incouraging able Miniſters, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing a Catholick ſucceſſion of a complete and Apoſtolick <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry</hi> to this as all other Ancient and Renowned Churches, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting that great Scandall and Schiſme (to the Papiſts (now) moſt deſired and welcome) which is and will ever hereafter be imputed to us with unanſwerable reproches, while, by <hi>Apoſtatizing</hi> from <hi>Primitive Epiſcopacy,</hi> we do not ſo much forſake the <hi>Romane party,</hi> (which in this point, as in many others, is Orthodox and ſound) as the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> and that <hi>Authoritative</hi> order which began with Chriſtianity, and ought as much as may be in providence for ever to continue with it. An ordained Miniſtry, a right <hi>Government,</hi> and good Order in the Church, being (as I have demonſtrated) no leſſe neceſſary for the Churches <hi>well-being,</hi> than the Word and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments are for the being or beginning of it.

                  <hi>Authoritative</hi> and complete <hi>Miniſtry.</hi> Nor is this to be (or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily) had without Epiſcopacy; leaſt of all with the violent and undeſerved extirpation of Epiſcopacy, if we will follow the <hi>judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, cuſtome</hi> and <hi>practiſe</hi> of all Chriſtian Churches from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, rather than modern <hi>novellers,</hi> who will never be able to make up the breaches, or to patch up the Rents, which they have either raſhly or unneceſſarily made in this particular, not from the Roman onely, but indeed from the Chriſtian and <hi>Catholick</hi> patterne, to which the <hi>Reformation</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> ſtudied exactly to conforme, as in other things, ſo in the <hi>point of Epiſcopacy,</hi> untill the fatall fury of theſe later times: which is the more unexcuſable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no Church in the world had leſſe cauſe either to complaine of, or to reject, <hi>its Biſhops</hi> or Epiſcopacy; for certainly no Church ſince the Apoſtles daies was ever more flouriſhing under Epiſcopacy (for other Government was not known till of late) nor had any Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Church either more worthy <hi>Biſhops,</hi> for the moſt part of them, or more able Miniſters, even at that time when all <hi>Biſhops,</hi> with their Order and Succeſſion, were <hi>devoted to utter deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not that I here forget how ſome <hi>Biſhops</hi> in <hi>England</hi> were under very great <hi>Jealouſies,</hi> as if they were <hi>Popiſhly affected</hi> and <hi>inclined,</hi> as if they were <hi>under-hand Factors</hi> for <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>ſecret Traitors</hi> to the <hi>Reformed Religion</hi>: Thus moſt (if not all) of them were cenſured by ſome men of very ſharp noſes and ſevere tongues, yea and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned before they were tryed, for ſuperſtitious and Super-ceremonious Prelates. Hence that popular Odium and Indignity of joyning <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy</hi> and <hi>Popery</hi> together: which <hi>Sarcaſm</hi> and <hi>reproch,</hi> I confeſs, ought by all wiſe Biſhops and other Miniſters to have been ſeriouſly avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſo as no way juſtly to deſerve any ſuch <hi>ſuſpicion, taunt</hi> or <hi>proverb</hi>; there being nothing leſs advancing, or more diminiſhing, the true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and honour of <hi>Christian Miniſters</hi> and <hi>Reformed Biſhops,</hi> than unworthily to comply with or conform to the <hi>Biſhop</hi> and <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> in thoſe things where the diſtance is as juſt and neceſſary as it is great, and grounded on Gods Word, being founded upon that <hi>eternal diſtance</hi> which is and ever will be between <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, Truth</hi> and <hi>Falſhood, Error</hi> and <hi>ſound Doctrine,</hi> between the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the <hi>ſacrilegious Inventions</hi> of <hi>Men,</hi> between the <hi>infallible Rule</hi> and <hi>Oracles</hi> of <hi>Gods Word</hi> in the Scripture, and the <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable Canons</hi> of <hi>poor men,</hi> between the <hi>Catholick Cuſtom</hi> of pure and <hi>Primitive Churches,</hi> and the particular practiſes of <hi>later Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations,</hi> brought in in the twilight of dark and depraved times.

               </p>
               <p>Which juſt bounds, as far as ever I could underſtand, our pious <hi>Biſhops</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> from the firſt <hi>Reformation</hi> till now, have <hi>religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly obſerved</hi>; not one of them (much leſs all) deliberately or open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

owning any <hi>communion</hi> with the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> where they ſaw the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> had made a juſt, clear and neceſſary <hi>ſeparation</hi>: yea, the <hi>learned Biſhops</hi> of <hi>England</hi> have, generally, ſo fully confuted the Falſity, Injury and Indignity of that <hi>calumny,</hi> both by their Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, Writing, Living and Dying, that men muſt be <hi>blind</hi> with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite, <hi>mad</hi> with malice, or <hi>drunk</hi> with paſſion, when they <hi>vomit</hi> out ſo <hi>foul calumnies</hi> againſt all <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> as if they were Pandars for Popery, and Pimps to the Whore of <hi>Babylon</hi>; for this is the language of ſome mens oratorious Zeal againſt our Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and all Epiſcopacy, which will in time much more agree with Presbytery and Independency, I fear, than ever it did with Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy.</p>
               <p>But it wil be demanded of me, whence then aroſe this <hi>ſmoke</hi> of <hi>Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie,</hi> which was ſo popular and ſpread abroad, that it made ſo many pure Eyes to ake and ſmart, yea to grow watry and blood-ſhotten, not onely among the vulgar, but even among our <hi>greateſt Seers</hi> and <hi>Overſeers?</hi> Was there no fire where there was ſo great a ſmoke? My Anſwer is, theſe jealouſies of ſome <hi>Biſhops</hi> (and other Miniſters who moſt imitated them) being <hi>Popiſhly inclined,</hi> never had, ſo far as ever I could diſcern, any farther ground than this: Some Biſhops pleaſed themſelves, beyond what was generally <hi>practiſed</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> with a more <hi>ceremonious conformity</hi> than others obſerved; firſt, to the Canons and Injunctions, which (they thought) were yet in force in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> being not <hi>repealed,</hi> but onely <hi>antiquated</hi> through a general diſuſe; next, being aged and learned men, and more <hi>converſant</hi> in the <hi>Antiquities</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> than younger <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,</hi> they found that ſuch <hi>ceremonious Solemnities</hi> in Religion were then <hi>very much uſed,</hi> without any ſin or ſcandal; no godly Biſhop, Presbyter, or other good Chriſtian, ever making ſcruple of uſing the ſign of the Croſs in Baptiſm, and at other times of Bowing, Knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, Proſtrating himſelf, or of putting his mouth to the ground and kiſſing the Pavement when he came to <hi>worſhip</hi> God, or to <hi>celebrate</hi> holy Myſteries, expreſſing thereby that Humility, Faith, Ferven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, ſenſe of his own ſinful Unworthineſs, and that unfeigned Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence which he bare in his heart toward God and his Service. This, I ſuppoſe, made ſome of our <hi>Biſhops</hi> hope that they might with the like <hi>inoffenſiveneſſe</hi> add ſuch <hi>Solemnity</hi> to <hi>Sanctity,</hi> and ſuch outward <hi>Veneration</hi> to inward <hi>Devotion,</hi> and yet be as far from <hi>Popery</hi> or <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition</hi> as the ancient Chriſtians were; yea, as thoſe <hi>Miniſters</hi> and <hi>others</hi> now pretend to be, who make ſo much of <hi>lifting up their eyes</hi> and <hi>hands in Prayer,</hi> or who are pleaſed to be <hi>uncovered in Praying, Preaching, Singing,</hi> or <hi>Celebrating the Sacraments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides this, many Biſhops found a ſecret <hi>genius</hi> of <hi>Ruſticity</hi> and <hi>Rudeneſſe,</hi> of <hi>Familiarity</hi> and <hi>Irreverence,</hi> ſtrangely prevailing among <hi>Country-Preachers</hi> and <hi>People</hi> ſo far, that they ſaw many of them pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced much of their Religion in affecting a ſlovenly <hi>rudeneſſe</hi> and <hi>irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence</hi> in all publick and holy Duties; loth to kneel, not onely at the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> but at any <hi>Prayers,</hi> or to be <hi>uncovered</hi> at any <hi>Duty,</hi> ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb n="627" facs="tcp:97412:334"/>
to any man, and prejudiced againſt all he did, if he ſhewed any ceremonious <hi>reſpect</hi> in his <hi>ſerving God</hi>: They ſaw ſome were grown ſo <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> that they forgot they had <hi>bodies</hi>; and pretending to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove themſelves to God onely as to the inward man, they cared not for any thing that was <hi>regular, exemplary, orderly, comely</hi> or <hi>reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,</hi> as to the outward celebration, in the judgement and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Hence ſome men grew to ſuch great applaudings of themſelves, (as if this were the onely <hi>ſimplicity</hi> of the Goſpel) that they thought every man went about to cut the throat of <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> who applied any <hi>Sciſſers</hi> or <hi>Razor</hi> to <hi>pare off</hi> rudeneſs and ruſticity, or to trim it to any <hi>decency</hi> in the outward <hi>Miniſtrations,</hi> according to what ſeemed beſt to the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> Many Biſhops thought that Religion would grow ſtrangely <hi>wild, hirſute, horrid</hi> and <hi>incult,</hi> like <hi>Nebuchadnezzars hair</hi> and <hi>nails,</hi> if it were left to the <hi>boyſterous Clowneries</hi> and <hi>unmannerly Liberties</hi> which every one would affect, contrary to the publick appointment of the Church.</p>
               <p>If ſome Biſhops pleaſed themſelves in uſing ſuch <hi>outward</hi> and <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned Ceremonies,</hi> beyond what was ordinary to ſome men, yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a <hi>thouſand decent</hi> and <hi>innocent Ceremonies,</hi> ſuch as thoſe enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Church of <hi>England</hi> were declared to be, do not amount to one <hi>Popiſh Opinion</hi>; nor are they ſo <hi>heavy</hi> as one <hi>popular</hi> &amp; <hi>erroneous Principle,</hi> which tends to <hi>Faction, Licentiouſneſſe</hi> and <hi>Profaneneſſe. Ceremonies</hi> may poſſibly be thought <hi>ſuperfluous,</hi> becauſe not of the ſubſtance of the Duty; but they are not to be charged as <hi>ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> where the Devotion of the heart is holy, and the Duty is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely performed for the Eſſentials of it, as it is inſtituted by Chriſt, &amp; enjoyned by the Word of God, who hath left the <hi>ceremonious part</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> more or leſs, very much to the <hi>prudence</hi> of his <hi>Church,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſeveral forms and cuſtoms of <hi>civil reſpect</hi> and <hi>decency</hi> uſed in the world; which St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> and St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> with all the Ancients declare, placing no further Religion in any Ceremony of humane invention and uſe, than it ſerved aptly to excite or expreſs inward <hi>ſincerity</hi> of <hi>Devotion,</hi> and an outward <hi>conformity</hi> to the decent cuſtoms of any <hi>Church:</hi> Which keeping to the Truth, Faith and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Inſtitutions of Chriſt, for the main, were not blameable for that variety of Ceremony, which was and might be obſerved without any damage to Truth, or breach of Charity.</p>
               <p>As to the maine charge then, that <hi>Biſhops</hi> in <hi>England</hi> were <hi>Popiſh,</hi> that is warping from the <hi>Reformed Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as it was and is ſtated oppoſite to the <hi>Romiſh errors</hi> and <hi>corruptions,</hi> I do believe that the <hi>Biſhops</hi> of <hi>England</hi> were in all Ages ſince the Reformation, and in this laſt, as much <hi>removed,</hi> and as free from <hi>Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> as the moſt rigid <hi>cenſors</hi> of them, who dare accuſe every man for <hi>Popiſh,</hi> who is not boyled up to the ſame ſuperſtitious height and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonious Antipathy with themſelves, or who do not preſently adopt every mans new fancy, opinion and form of Religion, (though private, forraine and impertinent to us) rather than the <hi>publick Authority</hi> and
<pb n="628" facs="tcp:97412:335"/>
wiſdome of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in its religious determinations and injunctions; which were not more <hi>Moderate</hi> than <hi>Orthodox,</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly and Comely, not partaking of the <hi>Romiſh contagion,</hi> though it did not abhor the Romane or any Chriſtians <hi>Communion,</hi> ſo far as <hi>Rome</hi> kept any <hi>Communion</hi> with <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> I meane with the <hi>Primitive, Catholick</hi> and true <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I do not pretend to ſearch the hearts of any <hi>Biſhops,</hi> nor (it may be) ſhould I have approved ſome things which ſome of them ſaid or did, as to the <hi>unſeaſonableneſſe,</hi> rigor and exceſſe: yet this I affirm, that thoſe men muſt have foreheads of <hi>flint,</hi> hearts of <hi>braſſe,</hi> and pens of <hi>Iron,</hi> who dare to charge <hi>with Popery</hi> any one of thoſe <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Biſhops</hi> whom I have mentioned with honor; beſides many more whom I have omitted, who better knew the true Medium of Religion and Meaſures of Reformation, between Superſtition and Profaneneſſe, Affectation and Irreverence, Indevoutneſſe and Rudeneſſe, than any of their fierceſt oppoſers and unjuſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyers.</p>
               <p>And ſince I have thus far undertaken, not the <hi>Patrociny</hi> (which is a work far above me) but ſuch a <hi>parentation</hi> at the <hi>Funerall of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> as may (I hope) not misbecome me, I ſhall further adventure to do ſo much right to <hi>ſome Biſhops,</hi> to whom I was moſt a ſtranger, as to this foule <hi>ſuſpicion</hi> of <hi>Popery,</hi> which being firſt fixed upon them, was eaſily <hi>diffuſed</hi> to all the <hi>Biſhops</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> by the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſpreading of all envious and evil reports, which eaſier find en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment in mens hearts and tongues, than any that are good: For theſe ſeem to men to leſſen themſelves by <hi>commending</hi> others; the others help either to cover or excuſe mens own faults, or to ſet off their ſeeming zeal and vertues.</p>
               <p>The firſt and greateſt was the laſt <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who was by many ſuſpected and charged not onely as <hi>Popiſhly</hi> affected himſelf, but as a poyſoner of the whole <hi>ſtreame</hi> and current of the <hi>Reformed Religion</hi> in <hi>England</hi>; at laſt he was treated either as a <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick</hi> or a <hi>Traitor,</hi> or both, to Church and State.</p>
               <p>It becomes not me to ſentence either the ſentenced, or ſentencers that adjudged him to death, his and their judgement is with the <hi>Lord</hi>; onely as to the aſperſion of his <hi>being Popiſh</hi> in his judgement (which reflected, in the repute and event, upon all the <hi>Biſhops</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>) truly his <hi>own Book</hi> may beſt of any and ſufficiently, vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate him to be a very great <hi>Antipapiſt:</hi> great, I ſay, becauſe it ſeemes by that Learned diſpute, that he diſſented from <hi>Popery</hi> not upon po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular ſurmiſes and eaſie prejudices, but very learned and ſolid grounds, which true Reaſon and Religion make good, agreeable to the judgement of the Catholick Church in the pureſt and beſt times. And in this the <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> doth, to my judgement, ſo very impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially weigh the ſtate and weight of all the <hi>conſiderable differences</hi> between the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and the Engliſh <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> (not ſuch as are ſimple, futile and fanatick, but learned, ſerious and ſober) that he neither gratifies the <hi>Romaniſt,</hi> nor exaſperates him, beyond what is
<pb n="629" facs="tcp:97412:335"/>
juſt; neither warping to a novel and needleſs <hi>ſuper-reformation,</hi> which is a deformity on the right hand, nor to a <hi>ſub-reformation,</hi> which is a deformity on the left, but keeping that golden Meane which was held by the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>greateſt defenders</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>As to his ſecret deſigne of working up this <hi>Church by little and little</hi> to a <hi>Romiſh conformity</hi> and <hi>captivity,</hi> I do not believe he had any ſuch purpoſe or approved thought; becauſe, beſides his decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red judgement and conſcience, I find no ſecular <hi>policy</hi> or <hi>intereſt</hi> which he could thereby gaine, either private or publick, but rather loſe much of the greatneſſe and freedome which he and other <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops</hi> with the whole Church had: without which temptation no man in charity may be ſuſpected to act contrary to ſo cleare <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions,</hi> ſo <hi>deliberate</hi> and <hi>declared determinations</hi> of his <hi>conſcience</hi> and <hi>judgement</hi> in <hi>Religion,</hi> as the Archbiſhop expreſſes in that very <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Book.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I am indeed prone to think, that poſſibly <hi>He</hi> wiſhed there could have been any <hi>faire cloſe</hi> or <hi>accommodation</hi> between all Chriſtian Churches, (the ſame which many grave and learned men have much deſired:) And it may be his Lordſhip thought himſelf no unfit <hi>inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> to make way for ſo great and good a work, conſidering the eminencies of parts, power and favour which he had. Haply he judged (as many learned and <hi>moderate</hi> men have) that in ſome things between <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> differences are made wider, and kept more <hi>open, raw</hi> and <hi>ſore</hi> than need be, by the private pens and paſſions of <hi>ſome men,</hi> and the intereſts of ſome little parties, whoſe partial policies really neglect the publick and true <hi>intereſt</hi> of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church and Chriſtian Religion, which conſiſts much in <hi>peace</hi> as well as in purity, in charity as in verity: he found that where <hi>Papiſts</hi> were ſilenced and convinced in the more grand and pregnant diſputes, (that they are novel, partial, and unconforme to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church in ancient times; as in the Cup withdrawing, in the peremptory defining of Tranſubſtantiation, in publick Latine prayers, ſuch as common people underſtand not what is prayed or ſaid, in praying to <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Saints,</hi> in worſhipping Reliques and Images with divine worſhip, in challenging of a <hi>Primacy</hi> of Divine Power and Juriſdiction to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> over all, in their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>Apocryphall</hi> Bookes to the <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>ancient Canon</hi> of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, in their forbidding marriage to the Clergy, and the like) when in theſe points the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> were tired, diſcountenanced and convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, then he found they recovered ſpirits, and conteſted afreſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the unreaſonable <hi>tranſports, violences</hi> and <hi>immoderations</hi> of ſome profeſſing to be <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> who, to avoid Idolatry and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, run to ſacriledge and rudeneſs in Religion, denying many things that are juſt, honeſt, ſafe, true and reaſonable, meerly out of an (<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>) exceſſive <hi>Antipathy</hi> to <hi>Papists.</hi> Hence ſome are run ſo far that they will have as no materiall Churches built, or uſed, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated, ſo no Liturgy, never ſo ſound, ſolemn, and eaſie to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood;

ſo as no <hi>Biſhops,</hi> never ſo holy and Orthodox, ſo no <hi>Ministers rightly ordained</hi> by them, no orderly Ceremonies or decent Rites whatſoever uſed by the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> though they firſt had theſe from thoſe <hi>Churches</hi> which were yet <hi>beautifull</hi> and <hi>pure</hi> in their <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive health</hi> and <hi>integrity.</hi>

               <p>The truth is, it would make a <hi>wiſe man mad</hi> to fall under the ſini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>cenſures</hi> and <hi>oppreſsions of all vulgar opinions,</hi> who ſtill urge in things indifferent that unſociableneſs which is between <hi>light</hi> and <hi>darkneſs, truth</hi> and <hi>error,</hi> Reformation and Superſtition, never ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting themſelves for ſuperſtitious in being ſo Anticeremonious, Antiliturgicall and Antiepiſcopall: nor are they jealous leſt any thing that hath the heat of their <hi>zeal</hi> might want the light of true judgement, and be like a <hi>Taylors gooſe</hi> or <hi>preſsing iron,</hi> hot and heavy enough, but neither bright nor light, neither ſeeing nor ſhining. Truly I find the calmeneſs and gravity of ſober <hi>mens judgements</hi> is prone to improve much by Age, Experience, &amp; Reading of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, hereby working out that <hi>juvenile leaven</hi> and <hi>lee,</hi> which is prone to puffe up and work over <hi>younger ſpirits</hi> and leſſe <hi>decocted</hi> tempers in their firſt fervors and agitations. Poſſibly the <hi>Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop</hi> and ſome other <hi>Biſhops</hi> of his mind did rightly judge, that the giving an enemy faire <hi>play</hi> by juſt, ſafe and honorable conceſſions, was not to yield the <hi>cauſe</hi> or <hi>conqueſt</hi> to him, but the more to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince him of his weakneſs; when no honeſt yieldings could help him any more, than they did indamage the true cauſe or <hi>courage</hi> of his <hi>Antagoniſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For my part, I think the <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury</hi> was neither <hi>Calviniſt,</hi> nor <hi>Lutheran,</hi> nor <hi>Papiſt,</hi> as to any <hi>ſide</hi> and <hi>partie,</hi> but all, ſo far as he ſaw they agreed with the <hi>Reformed Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> either in <hi>fundamentalls,</hi> or innocent and decent ſuperſtructures: yet I believe he was ſo far a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> and of the <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> as he ſaw the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> did <hi>proteſt against</hi> the Errors, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, Uſurpations and Superſtitions of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; or againſt the novel <hi>opinions</hi> and <hi>practiſes</hi> of <hi>any party</hi> whatſoever. And certainly he did with as much Honor as Juſtice ſo far own the <hi>Authentick Authority, Liberty</hi> and <hi>Majeſty</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> (in its Reforming and Setling of its <hi>Religion,</hi>) that he did not think fit any private <hi>new Masters</hi> whatever ſhould obtrude any Forraine or Domeſtick <hi>Dictates</hi> to her, or force <hi>her</hi> to take her <hi>Copy</hi> of Religion from ſo petty a place as <hi>Geneva</hi> was, or <hi>Francfort,</hi> or <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> or <hi>Wittenberg,</hi> or <hi>Edenborough,</hi> no nor from <hi>Augsburg</hi> or <hi>Arnheim,</hi> nor any Forraine City or Town, any more than from <hi>Trent</hi> or <hi>Rome,</hi> none of which had any <hi>Dictatorian</hi> Authority over this great and famous Nation or <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> further than they offered ſober <hi>Counſels,</hi> or ſuggeſted good <hi>Reaſons,</hi> or cleared true Religion by Scripture, and confirmed it by good Antiquity, as the beſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter and decider of obſcure places and dubious caſes. Nor did his Lordſhip eſteem any thing as the voice of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> which was not publickly agreed to and declared by <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>This <hi>charitable ſenſe</hi> I ſuppoſe I may <hi>juſtly have</hi> of this very <hi>active</hi> and very <hi>unfortunate Prelate,</hi> as he ſtood at a <hi>great diſtance</hi> from me, and <hi>eminence</hi> above me; againſt whom I confeſs I was prone in my greener years to receive many popular prejudices, upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon report and interpretation of his <hi>publick actions.</hi> In one of which I was never ſatisfied, as to the Piety or Policy of it; that when his Lordſhip endeavoured to commend the <hi>Liturgy</hi> of <hi>England</hi> to the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> (which was a worthy deſign, as to the unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of <hi>Devotion</hi>) yet he ſhould affect ſome ſuch alterations as, he might be ſure, like <hi>Coloquintida,</hi> would make all diſtaſtful. Such was that in the Prayer of <hi>Conſecration</hi> and <hi>Diſtribution</hi> at the Lords Supper, which was after the old form of <hi>Sarum,</hi> and expunged by our Reformers as too much favouring Tranſubſtantiation; beſides ſome other changes in that and other things, of which poſſibly his Lordſhip could give a better reaſon than I can imagine, or have yet heard.</p>
               <p>Toward his decline I had occaſion to come a little neerer to his Lordſhip; where I wel remember, that a few daies after his <hi>firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement,</hi> when he ſeemed not at all to deſpaire of his innocency or ſafety, having occaſion to wait on him, and being not onely a <hi>ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> wholly to him, but under ſome prejudice with him, as to ſome relation I then had, yet he was pleaſed, after <hi>ſome acceſſes</hi> to him, to invite me to ſome <hi>freedom</hi> of ſpeech, asking me (among other things) what the ſenſe <hi>of people</hi> generally was of him and his actions. I freely told him, the vulgar jealouſies and reports were, that his <hi>Lordſhip,</hi> by ſecret <hi>approches,</hi> did ſeek to <hi>betray the Reformed Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> to the <hi>Roman Correſpondency</hi> and <hi>Communion</hi>; which was ſo tender and juſt an apprehenſion in all people, out of their zeal to their Religion, that I humbly conceived it were great wiſdome to avoid all ſuſpicion of it. Nor did it ſeem an hard matter ſo to do, in waies, as much to Gods glory and the Churches Honor, ſo leſſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to peoples jealouſie or obloquy; common people being eaſily won or loſt by perſons of <hi>publick place</hi> and eminent Authority, whoſe actions as they could not be hid, ſo their wiſdome or weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs would be expoſed to every cenſurer, according to that party and ſide which he moſt adopted or oppoſed.</p>
               <p>I added, that people were not taken generally ſo much with <hi>grand</hi> and <hi>ſeverer vertues,</hi> as with things more plauſibly and ſeaſonably, yet piouſly and prudently, adapted to their capacity as well as their good; that as they were not to be unworthily <hi>humored,</hi> ſo nor too roughly neglected or <hi>offended</hi>; that it was much eaſier not to <hi>raiſe,</hi> than to allay the Spirit of <hi>jealouſie</hi> in the Populacy; that it was no
<pb n="633" facs="tcp:97412:337"/>
hard matter for a good and great man honeſtly to make himſelf gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious with the beſt and moſt people, by doing them as much good as they could expect, without any wreſting of his or their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, without diminiſhing his lawfull Authority, or their ingenuous Liberties; that in ſome caſes and poſture of times, a wiſe man was not bound to do people more good than they would or could bear, nor was he to ſurfeit and tire them by over-driving them to better paſture; that it was poſſible to ſerve <hi>the times,</hi> and yet to ſerve <hi>the Lord,</hi> as the <hi>Pilot,</hi> that in a <hi>rough Sea</hi> humors the winds and waves, yet ſaves himſelf, his ſhip and goods; laſtly, that it was no hard matter for his <hi>Lordſhip,</hi> and other <hi>Biſhops</hi> of great parts and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to out-do in Preaching, Praying and well-doing all thoſe that moſt maligned Epiſcopacy.</p>
               <p>To this purpoſe I took the boldneſs ſometimes to ſpeak to <hi>his Lordſhip</hi>; which as he heard at firſt with ſomething a ſeverer brow, ſo he at length very gravely and calmly thus replied: Proteſting with a ſerious <hi>atteſtation</hi> of his <hi>integrity</hi> before Gods <hi>Omniſcience,</hi> that however he might miſtake in the mean and method, yet he never had other deſign than the <hi>Glory of God,</hi> the <hi>Service of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty,</hi> and the <hi>good Order, Peace</hi> and <hi>Decency of the Church of England:</hi> that he was ſo far from <hi>complying with Papiſts,</hi> in order to confirm them in their errors, that he rather choſe ſuch methods to advance the honour of the <hi>Reformed Religion</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> as he believed might ſooneſt ſilence the cavils of fiercer Papiſts, induce the more moderate <hi>Recuſants</hi> to come in to us, as having leſs viſible occaſion given them by needleſs diſtances and diſputes to ſeparate from us; which he thought aroſe much from that popular Variety, Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, Eaſineſs, Irreverence and Uncomelineſs, which might eaſily grow among us in the outward profeſſion of Religion, for want of exact obſerving ſuch <hi>uniformity</hi> and <hi>decency</hi> in Religion, as were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by the <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Canons</hi> of this Church and State. He added, that he had (further) a deſire, as much as he could, to relieve the <hi>poor</hi> and <hi>depreſſed</hi> condition of many Miniſters, which he had to his grief obſerved in <hi>Wales</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> where their diſcouragements were very great, by reaſon of the <hi>tenuity</hi> and <hi>incompetency</hi> of <hi>their Livings</hi>; that in his Viſitations he had ſometimes ſeen it with grief, among twenty Miniſters not one man had ſo much as a decent gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to put on, nor did he believe their other treatment of life was better; that he found the ſordid and ſhameful aſpect of Religion and the Clergy gave great advantages to thoſe that were <hi>Popiſhly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined,</hi> who would hardly ever think it beſt for them to joyn with that <hi>Church</hi> which did not maintain either its own Honour or its Clergy to ſome <hi>competency</hi> and <hi>comelineſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Much more diſcourſe his Lordſhip was pleaſed to uſe at ſeveral times to this purpoſe, which commands my charity to clear him, as far as I can judge, of any <hi>tincture of Popery,</hi> truly ſo called, or of any <hi>Superſtition,</hi> which placeth a Religion in the nature and uſe of that thing which God hath not either particularly commanded, or in
<pb n="634" facs="tcp:97412:338"/>
general permitted. I ſuppoſe he thought that where God hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to his Church and to every private Chriſtian, (ſo far as may conſiſt with the Churches good Order and Peace) a <hi>liberty</hi> of <hi>ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious</hi> and <hi>circumſtantial decency</hi> as to Gods worſhip, there neither himſelf was to be blamed, nor did he blame other men, if they kept within thoſe diſcreet and inoffenſive bounds which either the Churches publick Peace required, or its Indulgence to private Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians permitted. And thus I leave this <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> to ſtand or fall to his and our <hi>great Maſter,</hi> who will judge our confidences and infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties according to our ſincerity. Doubtleſs this Prelate had more in him of Charity, Liberality, Munificence and Magnificence (as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the works he undertook to found, to build or to repair) than ever I ſaw in any of thoſe who are the having and getting, not the giving enemies to Epiſcopacy.</p>

               <p>I confeſſe, things of this nature, which being obſolete are urged afreſh upon the publick practiſe of Chriſtians in Religion, ought (as I conceive) to have their <hi>revived</hi> and <hi>renewed</hi> Authority from the <hi>joynt Counſell, pblick prudence</hi> and conſent of the Nation, elſe rigorous remedies, even of diſorders, may prove worſe than the ſuppoſed or reall <hi>diſeaſes.</hi> For many antiquated <hi>Ceremonies</hi> in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, though they be not quite <hi>worne out,</hi> yet, as garments long agoe made and now out of faſhion, are rather to be kept as <hi>Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> in the <hi>Wardrobe</hi> and Records of Religion, than to be on the ſuddaine put upon mens backs, and urged to be worne; eſpecially when they ſeem antique to the moſt, and uncomely by their unwon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedneſs to be commonly worne, though the ſtuffe be never ſo good, and the ſtate of them not unhandſome.</p>

And ſince we hold Baptiſm among the Papiſts to be valid, which is the ſign of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians new birth, and firſt admittance to the Churches Catholick Communion, he might hope, that dying in that Communion ſo far as it was Catholick, would be no hindrance to his admiſſion to the Church in Heaven. At worſt, it ſeems his <hi>diſcontent</hi> and <hi>deſpair</hi> drove him rather to think of <hi>returning</hi> to the Confines of <hi>Egypt,</hi> where he believed there might be found ſome <hi>Bread of life</hi> in an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly way of Houſe-keeping, than <hi>to dye in the Wilderneſſe</hi> of a Church which was now <hi>howling</hi> and <hi>ſtarving,</hi> and ſelf-deſolating in <hi>his apprehenſion</hi>; that, as <hi>Lots Daughters</hi> were ſo far excuſable for

their <hi>incests</hi> with their Father, as they believed all men were <hi>deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> beſides, ſo may this <hi>poor Biſhop</hi> (now made poor, when he had been <hi>very rich</hi>) have this to plead for his reſting <hi>at laſt</hi> in the boſom of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> that he knew not any other ſo <hi>viſible</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous</hi> a <hi>Church,</hi> either fit, or worthy, or willing to receive one that had ſo long lived a <hi>Protestant</hi> and a <hi>Biſhop</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Engl.</hi> and was now no longer permitted either to live or dye, either a Proteſtant or a Biſhop, according to the <hi>constitution</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi>; from which at its beſt, many of thoſe have more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated themſelves living and dying, who are the ſharpeſt Cenſurers of this Biſhop for dying a Papiſt, which is but a greater kind of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratiſt from the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> and the <hi>Church Catholick</hi> in ſome Opinions and Practiſes. But I have done with this Biſhop, who was dying moſt declared, and with the other two, who living were moſt dubious and ambiguous, in the cenſures of the world, as to their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. What their Morals, Prudentials or Devotionals were, (who had ſo long and ſo great an influence of power and favour) I muſt leave to the Supreme Judicature of God above them, and that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate or lower Bench of their Conſciences within them. If we ſhould take their dimenſions by the ſucceſſes and events, truly they have been very unhappy: after-Counſels are prone to think it had been eaſie to have prevented ſuch calamities; but the <hi>race is not to the ſwift,</hi> nor <hi>the battail to the ſtrong.</hi> Though true Piety is alwayes the beſt Policy, yet it is not alwayes attended with Proſperity. No doubt the ſins of all ſorts were ripe for wrath, and in common cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities the beſt may ſuffer as well as the worſt; the afflictions of the firſt being their tryals, of the ſecond their puniſhment.</p>
               <p>My concern is onely to examine the ground of that Charge caſt upon them, and for their ſakes upon all our Reformed Biſhops, as if ranckly <hi>popiſh,</hi> as if <hi>Prelacy</hi> and <hi>Popery</hi> were no more ſeparable then <hi>Gehezies Bribery</hi> and his <hi>Leproſie</hi>; which I juſtifie to be as falſe a <hi>calumny</hi> as it is <hi>foul,</hi> and no way becoming the mouths or thoughts of thoſe who aim to judge <hi>righteous judgement,</hi> or conſider the account they muſt give to God of what they ſay and do, in truth or falſity, in juſtice or iniquity. This I am ſure, if our Biſhops, and many other grave Divines, had no inclination to Popery in their Proſperity, their Adverſity might have been a great temptation to them, leſs to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove that Reformed Religion, not for which, but from which, they have ſuffered ſo hard meaſure, as untried and unconvicted to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, puniſhed, deſtroyed, beyond any men that lived orderly and peaceably.</p>

It is Dr. <hi>James Uſher,</hi> late Archbiſhop of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magh,</hi> and Lord Primate of <hi>Ireland</hi>; whom I reckon as ours, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe not onely his aſhes and mortal remaines are depoſited with us, but he lived his laſt yeares of exile, and ended his mortality amongſt us in <hi>Engl.</hi> where beſides his conſtant paines in Preaching, even to his laſt, he hath left us many of his Learned works, which are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed by, and highly eſteemed of, all worthy men who were bleſt with the example of his great and unſpotted worth, which no envy, no malice can (I think) be ſo impudent as to blemiſh.</p>
               <p>With this rare and Reverend <hi>Prelate,</hi> this great and gracious <hi>Biſhop,</hi> I was rather happy than worthy to be acquainted many yeares, ſo far as to be able more neerly to diſcover his genius and temper, both before and after the ſtorme of blood and Maſſacre in <hi>Ireland</hi> had driven this holy man to fly from that <hi>(Terra irae Dei)</hi> land of Gods wrath, and to take ſuch <hi>Sanctuary</hi> or ſhelter as then he hoped might be had in <hi>England</hi> for <hi>Proteſtant Biſhops</hi>; where he little thought (good man) he ſhould have found ſome <hi>Protestants</hi> in <hi>England</hi> as fierce to undoe and deſtroy their <hi>Biſhops</hi> (though of the ſame Reformed Faith, and of unblameable Profeſſion) as the moſt Jeſuited <hi>Papiſts</hi> were in <hi>Ireland</hi>; who were and are ſworne enemies againſt them, not as Chriſtian <hi>Biſhops,</hi> but as of the Reformed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which had nothing in it more Primitive, Illuſtrious and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable than this, that in <hi>England</hi> it ſhined with the glory of thoſe Apoſtolick Stars, Godly and Venerable <hi>Biſhops,</hi> which did not depend on the <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi>

Much of this Treaſure was diſcovered in his writings, printed, and not yet printed, of all ſorts, both of greener and riper ſtudies, in all which he was exact and complete.

of Plagiary Compilators, or Syſtematicall Collectors, (as <hi>Scriba doctus ad regnum Caelorum</hi>;) but he brought forth out of his large heart and vaſt reading new as well as old, things of rare, hidden and <hi>untroden obſervation,</hi> even out of Manuſcripts which ſcarce any but his <hi>Eagle-eye</hi> had ſeen, and but few could read. All which he judiciouſly collected, methodically diſpoſed, clearly explained and aptly applyed: yet it was with him as with copious and <hi>living ſprings,</hi> the leaſt part of his innate, acquired and unexhauſted fulneſſe was to be diſcerned <hi>by any of his outward emanations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So accurate was he in all uſefull and <hi>Learned Languages,</hi> Occiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall and Orientall; ſo cleare a proſpect he had of all <hi>History</hi> and <hi>Chronology,</hi> of all <hi>Controverſies</hi> ancient and modern, that nothing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaped him: nor was he onely as a Reader and Spectator, but as a Judge and Cenſor, as an Arbitrator and Dictator in Diſputes, as one that ſate in a Tribunall of Soveraigne Learning above all. Nothing was new or hidden to him in <hi>Philology, Philoſophy, Geography, Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy, Mathematicks,</hi> and leaſt of all in <hi>Theology</hi> or <hi>Divinity</hi>; he had <hi>conquered</hi> all others, but in this he <hi>Triumphed,</hi> which was the <hi>Trophee, Crown</hi> and <hi>Center</hi> of all his other ſtudies.</p>
               <p>There was ſcarce any Book, printed or <hi>Manuſcript,</hi> worth reading, in private or publick <hi>Libraries</hi> throughout all Chriſtendome, which he had not read, either in the <hi>Copy</hi> or <hi>Originall,</hi> and digeſted into the method or deſigne of his ſtudies; yea, and to a miracle remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, as to the maine <hi>contents</hi> of it. To the <hi>Immenſity of his</hi> Learning there was added excellent principles of <hi>Politick prudence,</hi> as a <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Church,</hi> and as a <hi>Counſellour of State</hi>; wherein he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous, not for the crafty projects and practiſes of policy, or for thoſe ſiniſter waies of Artifice and Subtilty, which are the uſuall unreaſonable <hi>Reaſons</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> the ſo admired depths of devilliſh Hypocriſie, but (indeed) the <hi>flats</hi> and <hi>ſhallowes</hi> of all Truth and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty: no, the Meaſures and Rules of his Politicks and Prudentialls were taken from that great experience he had gotten, and many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent obſervations he had made, out of all <hi>Hiſtories,</hi> as well <hi>Humane</hi> as <hi>Divine</hi>; though he alwaies laid the greateſt weight upon the grounds and <hi>inſtances of holy Scripture,</hi> which gives the trueſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>wiſdom</hi> or <hi>folly.</hi>

               <p>Theſe great abilities, managed with ſo much Piety, Prudence and Integrity, could not but make this <hi>Biſhop</hi> as fit to be a <hi>Counſellor of State,</hi> (for ſo he was in <hi>Ireland</hi>) or a <hi>Privy Counſellor to his Prince</hi> (which other Biſhops were who lived in <hi>England</hi>) as any of thoſe <hi>Miſepiſcopiſts</hi> were, who moſt envied and denyed that honour to this or any other Biſhops; with whoſe <hi>ſufficiencies</hi> few of their enemies (the chiefeſt of whom I well knew) were to be <hi>compared,</hi> either for Wiſdom, Gravity, Goodneſſe, Learning, Experience and Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, or for that Sanctity, Severity and Integrity, which make a complete Counſellour.

               <p>So that it is not onely my <hi>wonder,</hi> but it will be ſo to <hi>all Posterity,</hi> what ſhould move any ſober and religious wiſe men to exclude all <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Clergymen</hi> from all capacity of being either Members of the great and <hi>Parlamentary Council,</hi> or of the <hi>Privy Council</hi> of any Prince or State:</p>

And laſtly, the very <hi>light of Nature</hi> makes it ſeem very prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous and impolitick to exclude all Church-men, of which Biſhops were ever the chief Fathers, out of all publick Counſels: for all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have taught us, that they did ſo far venerate their Gods and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour their Religion, as never to carry on their <hi>chief Counſels</hi> &amp; publick <hi>Affairs</hi> of <hi>War</hi> or <hi>Peace,</hi> for <hi>Religion</hi> or <hi>Civility,</hi> without taking ſome of their Holy men and Prieſts into their Councils: ſo King <hi>Balak</hi> cals for <hi>Balaam</hi> in his greateſt exigencies; ſo were the <hi>Pontifs</hi> or <hi>Flamens</hi> ever among the chief <hi>Roman Counſellors</hi> and <hi>Senators</hi>; ſo were the <hi>Druids</hi> ever among the <hi>Britiſh</hi> and <hi>Gallick Parlaments</hi>; ſo were the <hi>Magi</hi> among the <hi>Perſian Princes</hi>; ſo at this day are the <hi>Mufties</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Turks chief Counſel</hi>: All Mankind knowing this, that the

               </p>
               <p>If the true God, and the Son of God, the <hi>Chriſtians Saviour,</hi> have juſtly the Titles of the <hi>All</hi> and <hi>Onely wiſe,</hi> yea the <hi>wonderful Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors,</hi> how (I beſeech you) can it ſtand with any Chriſtian ſenſe, or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of <hi>State</hi> and <hi>true Religion,</hi> to exclude thoſe men, beyond any, from all <hi>publick Councils</hi> of Church and State, who are moſt in <hi>Gods</hi> and <hi>Chriſts ſtead,</hi> beſt <hi>ſtudied</hi> and <hi>acquainted with the Divine Will, Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Counſel in Gods Word?</hi> I am ſure (ſo far as I am verſed in any Hiſtories) neither this Church or State (nor any other) did ever flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh <hi>without Biſhops</hi> among the prime Counſellors, both in Parlament and other-where; nor did they ever more flouriſh in Piety, Peace and Plenty, than when theſe had as great an influence as any other <hi>Men</hi> of Learning, Worth and Wiſdom.</p>
               <p>How things may hereafter thrive, where the Clergy are ſo nipt and froſt-bitten, time and ſucceſs will beſt inform the <hi>ſurvivers</hi>: yet it is no very promiſing omen, when neither Clergy-men are encouraged to be fit and able, nor, if fit and able, are at any hand to be admitted to ſuch publick uſe and honour; when any others may, whatever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, riſe and education they have had: for they are not alwayes noble Rivers and ancient Springs of Vertue, Wiſdom and Honour, but many times ſmall Brooks and very inconſiderable Rivolets, which aſpire to this honour of <hi>contributing</hi> their ſmall drops of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel into the great &amp; publick Ciſtern of <hi>Government.</hi> And ſuch were they (as far as I underſtood) <hi>men,</hi> for the moſt part, who with leaſt patience could bear any Biſhops to ſit in counſel with them, leſt they ſhould be miſerably <hi>outſhined</hi> and <hi>eclipſed</hi> by the others impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved parts and well-known learning, which vaſtly exceeded the ſmall ſhreds and ſhort ends which many other men were ſo highly conceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of in themſelves, whoſe Eſtates laid the greateſt foundation of their Honour.</p>
               <p>But I here crave the Readers pardon for this digreſſion, no way impertinent to my deſigne, which is, to demonſtrate the merit, and ſo far to recover the publick eſteem and honor, of good <hi>Biſhops</hi> and all the Clergy, ſuch as they ever enjoyed in this and all other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian States, till theſe darker daies in <hi>England</hi>; which pretend to ſeek a greater light, by putting out of Princes Courts and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels the chiefeſt Lamps and Stars of Learning, Religion, Counſell and Wiſdom.</p>
               <p>To returne then to this excellent <hi>Biſhop</hi> and able Counſellour, the <hi>Primate</hi> of <hi>Armagh:</hi> as to his perſonall policy, domeſtick ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty, or private cautiouſneſs, truly he had little enough of the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent</hi>; but as to his harmeleſſe innocency, he had very much of the Dove, ever eſteeming Piety the beſt Policy, and Sanctity the ſafeſt Sanctuary.</p>
               <p>If any thing might ſeem to have been as a veniall allay in him, it was a kind of charitable eaſieneſs and credulity, which made him prone to hope good of all, and loth to believe evil of any; eſpecially
<pb n="644" facs="tcp:97412:343"/>
if they made any <hi>Profeſsion</hi> or ſhews of Piety: he did not think, there could have been ſo much gall and vinegar mixed with the ſhewes, or realities, of ſome mens graces, untill he found by ſad experience ſome Godly people, and <hi>Presbyters</hi> profeſſing much Godlineſs, who formerly were prone to adore him as a God, or an Oracle, were (now) ready to ſtone and deſtroy him with all his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren the Britiſh Biſhops.</p>
               <p>He was moſt prone to erre on the right hand of charity, and to incline to thoſe opinions in things diſputable which ſeemed to ſet men furtheſt off from Pride, Licenciouſneſs and Profaneneſs; of which he was better able to judge than of Hypocriſie, being more jealous of Irreligion than Superſtition, which is the right hand, and more veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al extreme of Religion. He had not, til of late yeares, felt the ſcalding effects of ſome mens over-boyling zeal, or the dreadfull terrors of their righteouſneſs who affected to be over-righteous, who deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his Learned, Wiſe and Moderate Counſels, touching the ſetling of Peace, Order and Government in the Church.</p>
               <p>The rare endowments of this pattern of a perfect <hi>Biſhop</hi> were both wrapped up and ſet forth, as occaſion required, with ſuch Tender Piety, ſuch Child-like Humility, ſuch a Saintly Simplicity, ſuch an Harmeleſs Activity, ſuch an Indefatigable Induſtry, ſuch Unfeigned Sanctity, ſuch Unaffected Gravity, ſuch an Angelick Serenity, and ſuch an Heavenly Sweetneſs, as made all his Writings perſpicuous, though profound; his Preaching plaine, yet moſt prevalent. He had an Eloquent kind of Thunder of Reaſon mixed with Scripture-Lightning, which together had a pleaſing potent terror: his praying was fervent and pathetick, without affecting either too diffuſed a variety or too circumſcribed an <hi>Identity:</hi> his fervency, diſcretion and ſincerity, alwaies ſet his prayers far from any thing either of a verball and vaine repetition, or a flat and barren invention: he ever highly eſteemed, and devoutly uſed, the Liturgy of the Church.</p>
               <p>Indeed he Prayed, or Preached, or Practiſed, continually the Scholar, the Chriſtian and the Divine: his whole life, as to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſable part of it, was ſo Civil, ſo Sacred, ſo Affable, ſo Amiable, ſo Uſefull, ſo Exemplary to all perſons of any Worth, Ingenuity and Honeſty that came to him, that (in earneſt) nothing Ancient or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne that ever I knew or read of in theſe Britiſh Churches, or any forreigne Nation, was more Auguſt, Venerable, Imitable and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable than this <hi>bleſſed Biſhop</hi>; ſuch Candor, yet Power, ſuch Large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, yet ſingleneſs of heart, ſuch Majeſty with meekneſs, appeared in all that he ſeriouſly <hi>ſaid</hi> or <hi>did.</hi> I never ſaw him either moroſe or reſerved, much leſs ſowre or ſupercilious. If he were ſad, it made him not ſilent, but onely more ſolemn, as night-pieces, which have admirable work of perſpective in them, though not ſo much light with them: if he were chereful, he abhorred not ſuch facetious and ingenious elegancies of diſcourſe as ſhewed that Riſiblity was as proper to Religion as Reaſon, that Holineſs was no enemy to

               <p>He was indeed (as the Church of <hi>Smyrna</hi> teſtifies of holy <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carp,</hi> their firſt Biſhop, there placed by St. <hi>John</hi> the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>Whoſe humble and holy induſtry was ſuch, that beſides his <hi>vast deſignes</hi> for Writing and Printing, he never failed, ſince he was <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter, Prelate</hi> or <hi>Primate,</hi> to preach once every week, if health per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted him, beſides many times on the week-day upon occaſion; which was ſo far from being his reproch, as if he made himſelf <hi>too cheap</hi> (as ſome men of more <hi>pompous</hi> than <hi>pious</hi> ſpirits have ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniated,) that, like <hi>Davids dancing before the Lord,</hi> it turned not to his diminution, but to his great honor among all People, Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, <hi>Prelates, Peeres</hi> and <hi>Princes,</hi> that had any knowledge what was the true dignity of a <hi>Divine,</hi> and the commendation of a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Biſhop</hi>: nor was it any great paines to a perſon of his fulneſſe, who did not pump for, but poure out his Sermons like a pregnant ſpring, with a ſtrange Plenty, Clarity and Vivacity.</p>
               <p>Certainly, if all our <hi>Biſhops</hi> had ſo honored God according to their Places, Parts and Strength, by imitating the beſt of their Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, yea the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and our <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the greateſt Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop and greateſt Preacher, it is very probable, not onely <hi>Biſhops</hi> but <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> had at this day ſuffered leſſe diminution and diſhonor: if all Biſhops hearts and mouths had been as open as his, ſure they had ſtopped the mouths and ſilenced the tongues of all their adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. But by this and other, either real failings or ſuppoſed defects, of ſome few <hi>Biſhops</hi> (as in Sea-banks where low and weak) the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid inundation hath broke in upon <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> and all <hi>Biſhops</hi> with ſuch a <hi>torrent</hi> of <hi>violence,</hi> that we ſee the beſt of them could not keep out nor ſtand before the impetuoſity of the times; which if any <hi>Biſhops,</hi> in any Age or Church, might have merited and hoped to have done, this excellent Primate, and other <hi>Biſhops</hi> then in <hi>England</hi>

They ſhould ſpeedily, faithfully and impartially ſet themſelves to ſettle and maintaine, by all fit meanes, ſuch a way of true <hi>Religion,</hi> as to its publick Profeſſion, ſolemn Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, and paternall Government, as ſhall be found, by the joynt Wiſdom and Piety of the Nation, in Learned Synods impartially convened<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in free Parlaments peaceably diſpoſed, to be moſt conſonant to <hi>Gods word</hi> as to the ſubſtance of duties, and to <hi>Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Cuſtome</hi> as to the manner or Circumſtances of them.</p>
               <p>A work certainly not more <hi>neceſſary</hi> than eaſie, if mens hearts were as upright as they are able, with Gods bleſſing, to attaine ſo good a deſigne. Nor would men faile to be warme and diligent in it, if they had a true perception either of the great advantages which attend the <hi>Unity of any Nation</hi> in Religion, or of the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes, publick and private, which follow their diſtractions, while every one, out of a childiſh and inordinate delectation, is indulging their own private humors and opinions, to the injury and neglect of the publick.</p>
               <p>I ſee that in <hi>Terrors</hi> of fire, ſhipwreck or <hi>inundation,</hi> even devout people will fly from their <hi>Prayers, Sermons</hi> and <hi>Sacraments,</hi> to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure themſelves or their neighbours: with how much more zeal and earneſtneſs ſhould wiſe men diſpenſe a little with their private intereſts, ſecular Counſells and civil agitations, and ſometimes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to the reliefes and ſecurities of Religion, if they did apprehend and lay to heart the pernicious conſequences which are inſeparable from the Diviſions and Diſtractions of Religion? whereof I have given in the Second Book ſo many and ſo miſerable inſtances.</p>
               <p>If the work were but once well begun, it would be half done: <hi>leſſer diſputes</hi> would fall of themſelves, if once, as to the maine of <hi>Doctrine, Worſhip, Diſcipline</hi> and <hi>Church-Government,</hi> ſober men were agreed: if the maine ſores of Pride, Paſſion, Prejudice and Preſumption were well ſearched and clenſed, Charity, like a precious balſame, would ſoon work out, cloſe and heale all <hi>uncomfortable</hi> jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies and diſtances among good Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>However, ſome publick ſtandard owned &amp; eſtabliſhed for the ſetled <hi>Truth</hi> and Order of the Reformed Religion on all ſides, would (by caſting <hi>Anchor</hi> as it were) give ſome good ſtay at preſent, beyond
<pb n="655" facs="tcp:97412:348"/>
what the particular Confeſſions of ſeveral parties are like to do, ſuch as I ſee both Presbyterian Aſſociations and Independent Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations daily bring forth; and ſo will every new form do, till we all agree in ſomething uniform, as to the maine Rule, End and Order of Religion. This once done, however there might ſtill be ſome <hi>toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings</hi> and <hi>diſ-ſatisfactions</hi> as to private mens opinions; yet, as to the maine <hi>intereſts</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> as Chriſtian and Reformed, alſo as to the <hi>grand concernments</hi> of this Church, in its Unity, Honor, Purity and juſt Priviledges, theſe would by ſuch Ligatures and limits of Truth and Love be much preſerved from running into endleſſe factions and <hi>ſacrilegious confuſions,</hi> which cannot but tend to <hi>civil combuſtions,</hi> and end at laſt in the <hi>Romiſh uſurpation,</hi> which, as the <hi>Dam</hi> of <hi>Romulus,</hi> never failes to make its prey of any Churches that are divided and any Chriſtians that are ſcattered, <hi>diſ-ſatisfied</hi> or <hi>ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized</hi> with their Religion; by which meanes either our <hi>Thames</hi> will run to <hi>Tiber,</hi> or <hi>Tiber</hi> will come to our <hi>Thames.</hi> This will be the laſt reſult theſe the dregs and bottom of our <hi>Religious diſtractions</hi> and unſetledneſſe, if they be not wiſely remedied.</p>
               <p>Mean time, for want of ſome ſuch ſober <hi>fixation</hi> and equall ſtandard of Religion in its publick profeſſion, to which both Prince and people of all ſorts might both wiſely conſent and conform, Firſt, there cannot be that mutual Chriſtian Charity and neighbourly Communion among ſubjects; Next, there cannot be that kindneſs or correſpondence, that Love and Fidelity between <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>people,</hi> which would be if they did ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to the <hi>ſame prayers,</hi> and ſerve the ſame God in the ſame manner. Civil diſaffections do infallibly follow between <hi>Soveraignes</hi> and <hi>Subjects</hi> upon any Diverſity in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; as is evident not onely in <hi>Germany, Poland, France, Ireland</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> (where the greateſt popular diſ-ſatisfactions and aſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities againſt their Princes were ſtill raiſed by the <hi>jealouſies</hi> which ſome people had of their <hi>Religion</hi>) but alſo in <hi>England,</hi> while Subjects ſuſpected as if their Governors in Church and State did daily warp from that Religion which was Reformed, and eſtabliſhed in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England:</hi> from which, at laſt, it appeares none varied leſſe than thoſe that have been moſt deſtroyed, none more than thoſe whoſe jealouſies and paſſions for <hi>Reformation</hi> have over-born them and this Church to as great deformities as there are novelties, and to as many diſtractions as there are diviſions; which in Religion, as wounds, do not onely divide, but deface the beauty of any body <hi>Naturall, Civil</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiastick.</hi> Nor can there be any publick <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepancies</hi> of Religion between <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>people,</hi> but either the Prince cries out of <hi>Faction, Sedition</hi> and <hi>Rebellion,</hi> againſt his ſubjects; or ſubjects complain of <hi>Tyranny</hi> and <hi>Perſecution,</hi> as to their <hi>Princes</hi> injunctions, at leaſt of ſuperſtition, as to his profeſſion, if it be with more ceremony or leſſe ſolemnity than they fancy, or are wonted to. Yea, we find by ſome mens interpretation of their Covenant, the clauſe for allegiance thus limited in the <hi>preſervation of true Religion</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is, ſay ſome, as far as we think the King preſerves

               <p>Which ſad fate of a Prince and People who are every day to ſeek and chuſe, or change their Religion, cannot befall <hi>England</hi> without ſore conflicts and many bloody bickerings; the temper of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> being not ſo dull, and flegmatick, and over-awed, as that which poſſeſſeth ſome <hi>Dutch-men</hi> and <hi>Almaines,</hi> whoſe zeal for <hi>trade</hi> and <hi>gain</hi> (beſides their <hi>ſocial drinking,</hi> which begins and ends all their differences) makes them more capable to endure different profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Religion among them, ſo far as they do not endanger the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil <hi>peace,</hi> nor obſtruct their bleſſed <hi>commerce:</hi> yet even theſe Churches and States have ſome ſetled form and profeſſion of <hi>Religion,</hi> in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, worſhip and diſcipline: yea, they in the <hi>Netherlands</hi> have a very handſom <hi>Liturgy,</hi> and other publick boundaries or <hi>Symbols of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> from which when once their <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> perceived ſuch <hi>vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations</hi> to grow, by the <hi>Remonſtrants</hi> party, as might ſhake their civil peace and the ſtability of their Church, they did, to their no ſmall <hi>coſt</hi> and <hi>pains,</hi> ſtop the breach, both by the <hi>Synod of Dort</hi> and the power of the Sword, not permitting thoſe whom the publick ſenſe

               <p>At length theſe and the like <hi>paſsions</hi> or <hi>ſurpriſes</hi> even of ſome <hi>Orthodox Biſhops,</hi> were made patterns and encouragements to any <hi>pragmatick Hereticks</hi> and <hi>arrogant Schiſmaticks:</hi> Theſe, as they grew to any bulk and number, (like Snow-balls by rouling) ventured to

Hence Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication was at laſt every where reduced and debaſed to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ſpirits, full of <hi>pride, revenge</hi> and <hi>partiality</hi>; the <hi>Cathariſts</hi> or <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatians,</hi> the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> and <hi>Arrians</hi> feared not, by their <hi>Pſeudoepiſcopal</hi> Conventicles and <hi>Schiſmatical</hi> Aſſemblies, to denounce theſe <hi>Terrors</hi> and <hi>Anathema's,</hi> and to uſe the ſharp ſword of ſpiritual <hi>curſes</hi> againſt the ſoundeſt <hi>parts</hi> of the Church; as ſome dared to do againſt <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius,</hi> and all the Orthodox, both Biſhops, Presbyters and People.</p>
               <p>This made in after-times all <hi>Excommunication</hi> very much ſlighted and deſpiſed, while it either ſerved to little other uſe than to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the <hi>Popes</hi> wrath, for many hundred years of great Darkneſs and blind Devotion, or afterward, in times of more Light and Heat, it was u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>It is certain that the Miniſters of the <hi>Church of Chriſt,</hi> (which are made up of <hi>Biſhops, Presbyters</hi> and <hi>Deacons</hi> duely ordained and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in an orderly Subordination) are as the <hi>Arteries</hi> of the Body po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick in any Nation, State or Kingdom which is Chriſtian: theſe carry from the <hi>Head, which is Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the vital and beſt (that is, the <hi>Religious) ſpirits</hi> to all the parts; as good Laws do in reſpect of civil Juſtice and Commerce, like veins, convey the animal Spirits, with the blood and groſſer nouriſhment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from the Heart or Supreme power. Once check, abate or exhauſt thoſe <hi>vital Conduits</hi> of Piety and true Religion, all parts of <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> both noble and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble, will ſoon be enfeebled, abaſed, mortified; neither <hi>Common-people,</hi> nor <hi>Yeomen,</hi> nor <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> nor <hi>Noblemen,</hi> nor <hi>Princes,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Governours</hi> nor <hi>Governed</hi> will ever have either that Eſteem, Love and Honor for Religion which becomes it and them, nor will they receive that Vigour, Influence and Efficacy from it which is neceſſary for them; while in the general Levelling, Impoveriſhing, Shrinking and Debaſing of Scholars and Clergy-men, none ſhall have either diſcreet <hi>Tutors</hi> for their Children, or learned <hi>Chaplains</hi> for their Families, or able <hi>Preachers</hi> for their Livings, or grave <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provers</hi> for their Faults, or prudent <hi>Confeſſors</hi> for their Souls relief, or reverend <hi>Governours</hi> to reſtrain them, or ſpiritual <hi>Fathers</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort them for none of their petty Paſtors, Preachers or Miniſters, will appear to them much beyond the proportions of <hi>Country-pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants,</hi> not under any ſuch character of eminent worth, either for their perſonal Abilities, or any ſuch beam of publick Dignity and Conſpicuity, as may either deſerve or bear the love, reſpect and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of either <hi>Nobility, Gentry</hi> or <hi>Communalty</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> which are all high-ſpirited enough. Not onely the civil and viſible Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion, but the inward Genius and religious Conſtitution of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, will extremely alter in a few years, (as it is already much aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and abaſed) by reducing all <hi>Scholars</hi> that are of the Clergy or Miniſtry to a kind of publick <hi>Servility, Tenuity</hi> and <hi>Obſcurity,</hi> beyond any men of any <hi>ingenuous profeſsion:</hi> none of whom are ſo excluded,
<pb n="686" facs="tcp:97412:364"/>
but that, by their induſtry and Gods bleſſing, they may attain ſuch eminence and encouragements, as may make them moſt uſeful both to <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> both in Policy and Piety: neither of which can thrive or flouriſh to any Reſpect, Power or Splendour of Religion in any Nation, where the Clergy are made the onely Underlings and Shrubs, condemned everlaſtingly to the baſeſt kind of Villenage, which is a ſneaking and flattering Dependence: which poſture not onely ſtreightens and ſhrinks, but aviles and embaſeth the <hi>ſpirits</hi> of any men; there being nothing left them as to publick Favour, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment or Reward, under any notion of hope, which might <hi>height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en</hi> their parts, or <hi>quicken</hi> their ſpirits to any ſuch <hi>generous induſtry,</hi> as might at leaſt ſeek to merit them, though they never attained them: for ſtill the Publick will hereby have the benefit of Miniſters improved abilities, however few Miniſters obtain the deſerved emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency, the merit and capacity of which is many times better than the real enjoyment.</p>
               <p>Having thus commended to you the publick intereſt of Church and State, as they are very much depending upon the Honor and Happineſs of <hi>your Clergy</hi>; in the laſt place I beſeech all perſons of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſenſe and judgement, not to ſuffer themſelves to be ſo far ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized againſt the <hi>true Reformed Religion,</hi> or this <hi>Church of England,</hi> by its preſent diſtempers and ſufferings, as to abate of you <hi>former value</hi> and <hi>esteem of Her,</hi> or of your <hi>preſent pitty for Her,</hi> nor yet of your <hi>prayers</hi> and <hi>endeavours to repair Her.</hi> O give not ſuch advantages to your own innate <hi>corruptions,</hi> or to other mens fond <hi>Innovations,</hi> or to the Papiſts <hi>Triumphs,</hi> or every Jeſuits <hi>Machination,</hi> or the Devils <hi>Temptations,</hi> as either to diſcountenance, or deſert, or decry, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt the former excellent <hi>Conſtitution</hi> and <hi>Reformation</hi> of true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in the <hi>Church of England</hi>; in which I am fully perſwaded in my conſcience there was nothing wanting to the being and well-being of a <hi>true Church</hi> and <hi>true Chriſtians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt (your own <hi>inordinate Lusts</hi>) will be well enough content with <hi>no Religion,</hi> or at leaſt ſuch an one as ſhall moſt find fault with the <hi>Church of England</hi> and all its Religion: For I have found by experience that no men have proved move <hi>factious, affected</hi> and <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natick,</hi> than thoſe men and women who have been moſt conſcious to their youthful <hi>Enormities.</hi> They preſently apply to the gentleſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors and eaſieſt Repentance; which is rather to quarrel with and forſake the Religion they have moſt violated, than ſeriouſly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and amend: without which ſeverities <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Separatiſts</hi> think their Converts ſufficient, if they do but turn to their ſide and party. The ſecond <hi>(Novellers)</hi> will be content with any meer fancies or factions in Religion. The third (the Jeſuited <hi>Papiſts</hi>) with no pure, united and well-reformed Religion among us. And the fourth (the <hi>Devil</hi>) will be content with any Religion that is called Catholick, Reformed and Chriſtian, ſo it be not true, or not pure, or not well-reformed, or not orderly ſetled and uniform, or not charitably uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or not authoritatively managed and governed: Any of which
<pb n="687" facs="tcp:97412:364"/>
will in time very much unchriſten any Chriſtians, and unchurch any Church, by deforming and dividing them from the Beauty and Communion of the Church Catholick.</p>
               <p>Take heed of betraying your ſelves and your poſterity to <hi>Athei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall, licentious,</hi> immorall and irreligious courſes, by your <hi>Apoſtaſies</hi> from and <hi>deſpiciencies</hi> of the Learning and Piety, Gifts and Graces, Miniſtry and Miniſtrations, Order and Government, which were happily ſetled in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> Go over all <hi>the world,</hi> ſearch all ſucceſſions of the Church from the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> to our daies, you ſhall not find any thing more worthy your Love and Eſteem, your <hi>Veneration</hi> and <hi>addiction.</hi> Have you found any thing comparable to it in all the new <hi>vapours</hi> and <hi>floriſhes</hi> of Reformations, in any new In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, Conventions, Aſſociations, Separations, Diſtractions, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtortions, Confuſions?

Fifthly, in the Sanctity and Solemnity of its <hi>publick duties,</hi> which were neither exceſſive nor defective. Sixthly, in its <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> which had good Abilities, due Ordination and divine Authority. Seventhly, it its good <hi>Government</hi> and Eccleſiaſticall Diſcipline, where good <hi>Presbyters</hi> and good <hi>Biſhops</hi> had leave and courage to do their duties and diſcharge their <hi>conſciences,</hi> whoſe <hi>Fatherly Inſpection, Catholick Ordination</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſtick Juriſdiction,</hi> being wiſely managed by worthy men in their <hi>ſeverall ſtations,</hi> did juſtly deſerve the name of an <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> an holy <hi>Regiment</hi> or happy Government, when it was exerciſed with that Authority, yet Charity and diſcretion, which were ever intended by the <hi>Church</hi> for the common good of all thoſe Chriſtians that were within her <hi>boſome</hi> and kept her Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
               <p>If others do forget <hi>her,</hi> through fatuity or faction, covetouſneſſe or ambition, pride or petulancy, as undutifull and ungratefull chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, yet you may not, you will not, you cannot ſo far neglect your own and your poſterities <hi>happineſſe,</hi> or forfeit your own honor, or violate your conſciences, as to neglect the relief and recovery of <hi>your Spirituall Mother:</hi> But if you of the better ſort of men and Chriſtians, from whom all good men expect all good things, ſhould ſlight and neglect <hi>Her</hi> after the vulgar rate (which God forbid) yet muſt I never ſo far comply with you or all the world, as to call her <hi>former light darkneſſe,</hi> or her <hi>preſent darkneſſe light.</hi> Pretious with me muſt the name of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> ever be, whoſe record
<pb n="688" facs="tcp:97412:365"/>
is in Heaven, and in all gracious hearts, who were <hi>Born</hi> and <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, Inſtructed, Sanctified</hi> and <hi>Saved</hi> in <hi>her.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this Church of <hi>England,</hi> as I owe, (with many thouſands) ſo I returne (with ſome few) the <hi>Charity</hi> of a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> as to all Chriſtian Churches; the <hi>duty of a Son,</hi> as to a deſerving parent; the order of a <hi>part</hi> or <hi>member,</hi> as united and devoted to the whole; the <hi>obedience</hi> of an Inferiour, as to a Superiour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the gratitude of acknowledging Her Worth and Merit, the love of <hi>adhering</hi> to her unity, the candor of approving and conforming to her decent ceremonies, the <hi>modeſty</hi> of preferring her Wiſdome before my own or any other mens under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, the <hi>Humility</hi> of ſubmitting to her Spirituall <hi>Authority</hi> and Governours, the Piety and Prudence of relieving and reſtoring (as much as lies in me,) Her Catholick Order, Polity, Peace and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: all which I believe were allowed of God, and I am ſure have been approved by as Learned, Wiſe and Holy men as the world affords.</p>
               <p>I am deeply ſenſible of the many and great <hi>obligations</hi> which I have to this <hi>Nationall Church,</hi> and to its <hi>Miniſters</hi> and <hi>Biſhops,</hi> for my <hi>Baptiſme, Inſtruction, Confirmation, Communion</hi> and <hi>Ordination,</hi> not onely as a <hi>Member,</hi> but as a <hi>Miniſter</hi>; which I account my grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Honour, notwithſtanding the great <hi>depreſsion</hi> of the times in which I have late ward lived.</p>
               <p>I am ambitious to do not onely what becomes my <hi>private station,</hi> but to preſerve and expreſſe the publick reſpects which are due to this Church; whoſe <hi>Deſpiſers</hi> and <hi>Deſtroyers</hi> have never appeared to me with any <hi>Remarques</hi> of <hi>Beauty</hi> or <hi>Honour</hi> for <hi>Learning</hi> or <hi>Grace,</hi> for <hi>Modesty</hi> or <hi>Charity,</hi> for <hi>Prudence</hi> or <hi>Policy,</hi> comparable to thoſe that were the firſt Founders, Reformers, Defenders and Preſervers of this Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I muſt ever profeſſe that I find nothing like her Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, nor any thing exceeding her <hi>friends,</hi> in all that was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable in Catholick and true Antiquity.</p>
               <p>In behalf of this Church having offered many things to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of all <hi>good Chriſtians</hi> which are my worthy Countrymen, I hope, as my <hi>infirmities</hi> may exerciſe their Charity, ſo my <hi>integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> may expiate my <hi>infirmities,</hi> if I have in any thing expreſſed my ſelf leſſe becoming the honeſt and holy deſigne which I undertook, and have now by Gods help finiſhed; which was to ſet forth, Firſt, the <hi>Teares</hi> and <hi>Sigh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi>; Secondly, the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall of her <hi>Diſorders</hi> and <hi>Diſtractions</hi>; Thirdly, the <hi>dangers</hi> and <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>streſſes,</hi> if not remedied; Fourthly, the probable waies of cure and recovery, by Gods bleſſing, to ſuch Order, Honour, Unity, Purity and Peace as becomes ſo famous a Church and ſo renowned a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whoſe greateſt Crown was Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p>I know there will be many who cannot well beare that freedom of ſoberneſſe and Truth which either my ſelf or others may uſe in ſpeaking or writing for the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and its priſtine Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Order and Government, (although themſelves uſe never ſo great Liberties, Reproches and Injuries, in Speaking, Writing and
<pb n="689" facs="tcp:97412:365"/>
Acting againſt them.) For my part, I appeare in this onely as wrapt my ſelf in my <hi>Scholaſtick</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſtick Gown</hi>; I meddle not with any civil affaires, or <hi>Military tranſactions,</hi> properly ſuch: Thoſe are of an <hi>other ſphere,</hi> and of other principles, which I neither cenſure, nor, it may be, underſtand. I quarrell with no particular mens per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; I encounter onely that colluvies of factions, parties and novel principles, which, like the ſewers collected from many ſinks and kennells, have met together to beſmeare or over-beare the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> I deſpiſe no mans Religion, ſo far as it is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, deſerving that holy name in any Catholick and Chriſtian ſenſe: But I abhorre an unreaſonable, immodeſt, unjuſt and licentious way in any. I eſteem and embrace with all Charity whatever of Gods Spirit, of Chriſts Truth, of Grace and Vertue, of Gifts and Parts, of Morall Honeſty and Humanity I find in any men of any ſide: But I am too old and ſerious to be abuſed with vaporings, with affectations, with popular pretentions, with rude and raſh Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations; I am for ſolid, ſober, orderly, humble conſtitutions, or reſtitutions rather, of Order, Honor and publick encouragement to Religion, the Church and Clergy. No man hath juſtled or offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded me in all theſe turbulent times worth owning, nor have I an evil eye or an ill will againſt any man: What I write as to my Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick Calling, Honor, and the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Englands</hi> common concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, may (poſſibly) have ſomething of <hi>ſalt,</hi> but nothing of <hi>gall</hi>; there may be ſome corroſive to mortifie and meet with the diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and proud fleſh, but no venome to poyſon or hurt either the diſeaſed or the whole parts. It extremely grieves me to ſee how far the <hi>contagion</hi> of Ignorance, Impudence, Profaneneſſe, Irreligion, Faction, Diviſion, Levity, Popularity, Diſorder and Uncharitableneſſe hath ſpread among ſome of my brethren of the Miniſtry and many of my Countrymen, without any preſent advance, that I can ſee, or future hopes, (I ſay not as to their own Honour or Profit, but) as to Gods <hi>glory,</hi> or the <hi>publick interests</hi> of the true Chriſtian and Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Religion, or the good of mens ſoules, or the improvement of any grace and vertue. What any ſide offers as really good or conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient I allow; what they partially cry down, and cauſeleſly condemn or change, that I defend upon the account of this and all Churches Wiſdome, Honour and Happineſſe. If what I have written may do any good to the preſent or after-Ages, I have my deſigne; if not, I ſhall, by Gods help, hereafter redeem this waſte of time and labour, by applying to ſtudies more ſuitable to my Genius, Spirit and Age, which may more improve thoſe graces which are leaſt in diſpute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong good Chriſtians: yet in this I have not wholly loſt my labour, becauſe I have hereby further diſcharged my own <hi>ſoul,</hi> my <hi>conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> and <hi>reputation,</hi> from any <hi>approbation</hi> of what I judge to be either the <hi>ſins</hi> or <hi>imprudencies,</hi> the <hi>wickedneſſe</hi> or <hi>weakneſſe</hi> of this Age, in which I do not ſo much live as <hi>dye daily,</hi> weary that my ſoul finds ſo little hope of an happy reſt or compoſure, unity or harmony in our Church; which I had rather ſee and enjoy before I dye, than to
<pb n="690" facs="tcp:97412:366"/>
have the greateſt preferment in the world. I envy no men that have wrapped up their worldly <hi>intereſts</hi> in their <hi>religious policies,</hi> and daily gaine by the ſhrines of godlineſſe they have made. I do indeed boldly rifle their godly principles and pretentions, as to their <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties</hi>; for I ſee no reaſon as yet to yield to any of them, no not for an hour, though they ſeem never ſuch pillars, while they import as if the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> had heretofore conſiſted of a company of <hi>ſilly people</hi> and <hi>ſilly Prieſts,</hi> whoſe either ignorance, or ſuperſtition, or ſottiſhneſſe, or baſeneſſe, had hidden the <hi>beauties</hi> and <hi>bleſsings</hi> of true Religion from all peoples eyes, ſo that neither <hi>Biſhops,</hi> nor <hi>Presbyters,</hi> nor <hi>Princes,</hi> nor <hi>Parlaments,</hi> nor <hi>Convocations,</hi> ever till now ſaw what was fit to know and do in Church-matters, which are now to be taught and brought to light by the new methods of <hi>Presbytery</hi> and <hi>Independency,</hi> or by <hi>Anabaptiſm, Quakeriſm,</hi> and other rarities of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, untried and untamed Novelties, every way as ſhort of the <hi>Piety, Prudence, Unity</hi> and <hi>Majeſty</hi> of the Religion and Church of <hi>England</hi> heretofore, as they are wide of or beyond the true ancient bounds and Catholick grounds of <hi>Order, Government, Unity</hi> and due <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> I may adde, and of the Bleſſings or Proſperities, <hi>internal</hi> or <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, ſpiritual</hi> and <hi>temporal,</hi> which attended Epiſcopal Order and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Preſidency; which I profeſs to value, as now it is in its <hi>rags</hi> and <hi>ruines,</hi> far beyond the others in their <hi>ſilks</hi> and <hi>ſpruceneſſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Epiſcopacy is now far from being the object of any ſober mens <hi>Flattery</hi> or <hi>Ambition</hi>; yet I cannot but look upon it with ſuch an eye of <hi>pitty</hi> and <hi>reverence,</hi> as primitive Chriſtians were wont to do upon their <hi>Biſhops,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Polycarpus, Ignatius, Irenaeus, Cyprian,</hi> and other Martyrs, when they ſaw them <hi>impriſoned, beaten, tormented, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I know, yet I plead for thoſe men and for that cauſe, which was once <hi>ſtrong,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 4.10, 11.</note> but now is <hi>weak</hi>; was <hi>honourable,</hi> and is now deſpiſed; was <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured,</hi> but is now frowned upon by many (yea, I fear, moſt) men of ordinary ſpirits: yet I plead for that <hi>reverend</hi> Order, and thoſe <hi>reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend</hi> perſons, who have been made a <hi>ſpectacle</hi> to Angels and Men, ſuch as to this preſent hour <hi>ſuffer</hi> both <hi>hunger</hi> and <hi>thirſt,</hi> are naked and buffeted, having no certain dwelling-place; which being <hi>reviled</hi> do <hi>bleſſe,</hi> being <hi>perſecuted</hi> have <hi>ſuffered with patience,</hi> being defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med do <hi>intreat,</hi> and being the Glory of all Churches, as to Order, Unity and Government in all Ages, are now looked upon by many as the <hi>filth</hi> and <hi>off ſcouring of all things</hi>: yet am I one of thoſe Angels which attend <hi>Lazarus</hi> on his Dunghil; I have choſen to follow the clear, though now more exhauſted, <hi>ſtream of Antiquity,</hi> rather than the troubled <hi>torrents</hi> of any <hi>Novelties,</hi> which may be as <hi>ſhort-lived</hi> as they have been <hi>ſuddenly ſtarted.</hi> I have looked upon all mens prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and pretenſions, as to <hi>Eccleſiastick</hi> affairs, with what Candor, Equanimity and Sincerity I could. If in any thing I was inclinable to be <hi>partial,</hi> it was neither for <hi>Presbytery</hi> nor <hi>Independency,</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, which I never was <hi>catechized</hi> in, nor <hi>accuſtomed</hi> to, nor <hi>convinced</hi> of, as to any ſuch Piety or Policy, Wiſdom or Worth in them, which
<pb n="691" facs="tcp:97412:366"/>
might make me ſee cauſe to deſire or eſteem them; but I was ſway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt ſome things, not in the <hi>conſtitution</hi> ſo much as ſome mens <hi>adminiſtration</hi> of Epiſcopacy. I was originally <hi>principled</hi> to no ſmall jealouſies of <hi>Biſhops actions,</hi> when they were in their greateſt glory and power; nor do I yet think but that ſome <hi>Biſhops</hi> might have been <hi>greater Maſters</hi> of pious Arts than they have proved: yet I find now that in many things people were more afraid than hurt. For the main I conclude, no Miniſters or Governours, no Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendencies or Presbyteries, in any <hi>Reformed</hi> way, exceeded the Uſefulneſs, Merit and Excellency of our Engliſh Biſhops and Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters; nor is any thing as to Church-government comparable to a <hi>primitive Epiſcopacy,</hi> which includes the juſt <hi>Rights, Liberties</hi> or <hi>Priviledges</hi> both of Preſbyters and People. I neither diſpute nor deny any mens <hi>Morals, Intellectuals, Devotionals</hi> or <hi>Spirituals,</hi> fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than they ſeem much <hi>warped</hi> and <hi>eclipſed</hi> by their over-eager Heats and injurious Proſecutions againſt their Antagoniſts the <hi>Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Clergy</hi> and <hi>Church of England:</hi> but I abſolutely blame thoſe Miniſters want of <hi>politicks</hi> and <hi>prudentials,</hi> who by their <hi>Antiepiſcopal</hi> tranſports have ſo far diminiſhed not onely themſelves and their Order as Miniſters, but the whole ſtate of this Church, as to its <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> and <hi>Honour,</hi> its <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Plenty,</hi> its <hi>Unity</hi> and <hi>Authority.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In whoſe behalf ſince all wiſe and worthy men are highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, I cannot conclude with words of greater warmth and weight, than thoſe of the bleſſed <hi>Apoſtle</hi> St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
