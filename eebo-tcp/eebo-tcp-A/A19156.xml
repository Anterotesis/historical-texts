            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>Lillies and Daffadils stood on the top,</l>

            <l>Next Time and Mary-golds together stood,</l>

            <l>Thus whil'st I gazed on these Garlands gay,</l>
            <l>I saw how prettily the streame did play,</l>
            <l>VVith th'Osier twigs that grew vpon the banks,</l>
            <l>Acting a sort of sundry wanton prancks.</l>
            <l>Sometimes they'd stoope, and slyly steale a kisse;</l>
            <l>Sometimes skip vp, as if they scorn'd that blisse;</l>
            <l>Sometimes again (the fit being come vpon them)</l>
            <l>They'd iump into the streame, let her run on them:</l>
            <l>Who (like most women hauing men in thrall,)</l>
            <l>Insulted o're them, and grew proud withall.</l>
            <l>And when shee'd made them slaues vnto her will,</l>
            <l>Shee'd wend away, and let them weep their fill.</l>
            <l>Lo heer (thought I) these silly twigs may teach me,</l>
            <l>To shun Loues snares, lest womens wiles o're-reach me:</l>
            <l>For by these twigs I see (oh flinty hard!)</l>

               <hi>Nayis</hi> her selfe was foremost of this Crue,</l>

            <l>Some with silke Ribands did knit true-loue knots,</l>

            <l>In hand-kerchers, some working flowrs in gloues,</l>
            <l>And all for fauours for to send their Loues.</l>
            <l>One was commending of a comely swaine,</l>

            <l>But since I haue met thee (my old enemy)</l>
            <l>Setting aside all former enmitie,</l>
            <l>Let's make a truce, and for this night agree</l>

            <l>Their mighty Conquests made in euery coast,</l>

            <l>Both rich and poore must at their pleasures bow:</l>
            <l>For from the King that sits vpon the Throne,</l>
            <l>Vnto the meanest and most wretched one,</l>
            <l>Loue made his brags none (past their Infancy)</l>
            <l>The power of his God-head could deny:</l>
            <l>For with his arrowes he had wounded all,</l>
            <l>Made strong ones stoope, and stoutest minds most thrall;</l>
            <l>Nor wise, nor foolish, Nobly borne nor base,</l>
            <l>But first or last, Loue hath had all in chase,</l>
            <l>And made them all for to confesse, that he</l>
            <l>Had as great power as in a God could be.</l>
            <l>Then Death began: (qd. he) Loue brags too much</l>
            <l>Before sterne Death, whose strength and power is such,</l>
            <l>That all the earth doth tremble at my name:</l>
            <l>For young and old, the lusty and the lame,</l>
            <l>All stoop to death, who is impartiall</l>

            <l>If once I strike, I euer conquer'd make them.</l>
            <l>Whom Loue doth hit, in passions long may languish,</l>
            <l>But whom I strike, I do set free from anguish.</l>
            <l>Lou's but a child, and wanton tricks doth vse:</l>
            <l>But Death is dauntlesse, and doth none excuse.</l>
            <l>Folly blinds Loue, so that he cannot see,</l>
            <l>But shoots at randome, and lets some goe free;</l>

            <l>Anon sayd thus, (but more she could not say)</l>
            <l>

               <hi>Cupid</hi> at this, put finger in the eye,</l>
