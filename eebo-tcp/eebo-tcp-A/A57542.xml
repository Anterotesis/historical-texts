            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>JONAH I. 6.</bibl>
               <q>So the Ship-master came to him, and said unto him,
What meanest thou, O Sleeper? Arise, call
upon thy God, if so be that God will think up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us that we perish not.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IN this Book, we have a compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
History of the extraordinary mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the Prophet <hi>Jonah,</hi> to preach
Repentance to the <hi>Ninivites,</hi> whose
wickedness had come up before the Lord.
Wherein, if we consider the Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
that attend it, they will appear to be of
a very strange and extraordinary Nature;
so seemingly opposite to the thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed,
and yet so harmonious and success<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in the Event, that this Instance alone
were sufficient to humble our minds, make
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49609:5"/>
us acquiesce under all the Dispensations of
Divine Providence, rely upon God's Ways,
though they be never so unlike ours, and
walk submissively in his Paths, how crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and intricate soever they may seem to be.</p>
            <p>That a poor solitary Prophet out of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi>
should enter the Streets of the great
<hi>Metropolis of Assyria, Niniveh</hi> that great City,
(whose compass, say Historians, was forty
eight Miles, and her Towers fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred)
nay so exceeding great, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
himself, <hi>chap.</hi> 3. <hi>ver.</hi> 3. affirms it to be
three days journey within it self; that he
should there denounce woful judgment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Inhabitants thereof, if within
forty days they humbled not themselves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God; what could possibly be expected
from so daring an attempt, but that the
Prophet upon the first opening of his mouth,
should have immediately fell a Sacrifice to
the fury of the enraged multitude? Yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the contrary!<note place="margin">Heb. 4. 12.</note> his words become <hi>quick
and powerful, and sharper than a two-edged-sword;</hi>
he no sooner enters the City, and lifts up
his voice, but the People believe God, and
a Fast is proclaimed by a Decree of King
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49609:5"/>
and Nobles, a Fast of rigorous both for
Man and Beast, that the like was never
heard of before.</p>
            <p>Again,<note place="margin">Chap. 1. ver. 1, 2.</note> 
               <hi>The word of the Lord came unto Jonah
saying, Arise, go to Niniveh.</hi> The speedy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution
of his Commission, one would have
thought, should have been much forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the near approach of the Judgment,
<hi>Yet forty days,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chap. 3. ver. 4.</note> 
               <hi>and Niniveh shall be destroyed:</hi>
yet behold, he flies from the Presence of
the Lord, turns away from <hi>Assyria,</hi> goes on
Board at <hi>Joppa,</hi> and is bound for <hi>Cilicia;</hi>
nay, so regardless was he of his Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
that instead of trembling in the sight
of God (for alas,<note place="margin">Psal. 139. 7, 9, 10.</note> 
               <hi>Whither can he flee from his
presence? If he take the wings of the morning,
and dwell in the uttermost parts of the Sea, even
there shall his right hand hold him</hi>) so regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
was he, I say, of the heavenly voice,
and the Judgment consequent upon so great
Disobedience, that he lays himself down in
perfect security, is not to be awakened ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the loudness of the Winds, or the
roaring of the Waters; till at last admonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by a Heathen he is content to be cast o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-board,
and takes up an unheard-of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49609:6"/>
Lodging in the Belly of a Whale (which
by the way must give occasion for that Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of <hi>Hercules</hi> mentioned by <hi>Lycophron,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jo. Tzetzes in Lycophr. ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio Cassand.</note> who
calls him <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, because he was preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
three nights in the Belly of a Fish.)
Now that all these so seemingly untoward
accidents, should be so wisely managed in
the Event, as to mightily advantage that End
which they appeared so much directly to
oppose; this plainly shews, that such things
<hi>are the Lords doings,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 118. 23.</note> 
               <hi>and ought to be marvellous in
our eyes.</hi> Yet upon these strange occurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
'tis probable, the Mariners could not
forbear spreading the report of them,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vide</hi> Bishop <hi>Wilkins</hi> Beauty of Providence.</note> which
at last reaching <hi>Niniveh,</hi> might prepare the
Prophets way, possess the people that he
could not come to them but by a Miracle,
that he was a Person extraordinarily sent of
God, and by this means gain credit and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
to his Preaching.</p>
            <p>Now among all the Passages of this
History, I have made choice of that which
concerns the Prophet's behaviour whilst out
at Sea; as being most suitable to the present
Occasion, and most agreeable to my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
which is to be as practical as I can:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:49609:6"/>—What meanest thou, O Sleeper? Arise, call
upon thy God, if so be that God will think upon us
that we perish not.</p>
            <p>In speaking to which words, I shall do
these following things:</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. Shew, That the proper Effect of Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
by Sea, should be to awaken mens
minds, and raise them up unto Acts
of Devotion; <hi>What meanest thou, O
Sleeper? Arise, call upon thy God.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>II. The great Encouragement men
have to do this, from the especial
Providence of God over Sea-affairs;
<hi>If so be that God will think upon us, that
we perish not.</hi> And,</item>
               <item>III. I shall crave leave to answer some
Objections which this Discourse may
be thought liable unto.</item>
            </list>
            <p>I. That the proper Effect of Dangers by
Sea should be to awaken mens minds, and
raise them up unto acts of Devotion; <hi>What
meanest thou, O Sleeper? Arise, call upon thy
God.</hi> To call upon God in times of Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and Distress, is natural to mankind; but
no kind of Dangers have such an aptitude
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49609:7"/>
in them to rouse the Spirits of men, and
make them think what their condition is
towards God, as those which sea-faring men
are frequently exposed to.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 11. 25, 26.</note> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> recount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the dangers he had passed through in
preaching the Gospel to the Nations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
with <hi>perils in the deep,</hi> and again twice
repeats it in the same verse, <hi>in perils of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
in perils in the Sea;</hi> as if those alone
were the great afflictions he would most
glory in: and the Philosopher accounted
men at Sea to be but a kind of Borderers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the living and the dead.<note place="margin">Psal. 107. 23, 24.</note> 
               <hi>They that go
down to the Sea in Ships,</hi> saith the Psalmist,
<hi>they see the works of the Lord, and his wonders
in the deep; i. e.</hi> the great and mighty
works of the Creation, and the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
wonders of God's Providence, are so
apparent to these mens eyes that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but consider them, and take especial
notice of the dangers they pass through.
And however custom may in time wear off
all Sense of danger, yet can it never lessen
it, as will appear by considering these three
things: (1.) The Suddenness of those cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
which may happen to sea-faring
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49609:7"/>
men; (2.) The Number of them; and
(3.) Their Frequency.</p>
            <p>For their <hi>Suddenness,</hi> there are no kind of
accidents to which the lives of men are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
that are so sure and swift Executioners
as those which lye in wait for Mariners.
A man may linger out his days under a sore
Disease; and though some fiercer kinds
may sooner seize upon his Vitals, yet rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is Death this way so swift of foot as not
to give some Warning to the Patient, and
by alarming his Conscience make him so to
consider his latter end as to apply his heart
to Wisdom and Repentance. But alas! 'tis
far otherwise in the condition I am now
speaking of;<note place="margin">1 Kings 18. 44,</note> a man may see <hi>a Cloud no bigger
than his hand,</hi> yet in a moment its waters shall
overwhelm him, and the Deep shall swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
him up quick, before he shall be able
to <hi>arise, and call upon his God.</hi> The conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of this cannot but inform you what
obligations you have above other men to
be always in a readiness, and diligently to
watch, because you know not in what
hour this sad calamity may fall upon you.
<hi>Watch therefore,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 24. 42, 43, 44.</note> 
               <hi>for you know not what hour the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49609:8"/>
Lord doth come. But know this, That if the
good man of the house had known in what watch the
Thief would come, he would have watched, and
would not have suffered his house to be broken up.
Therefore be you also ready, for in such an hour
as you think not, the Son of man cometh.</hi>

            <p>For the <hi>Number</hi> of the dangers, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
yet more terrible, and beyond my
abilities to recount. The dangers of the
Waters beneath, the falling of Spouts from
above, the Rocks and Quicksands, the
tempestuous Winds and Hurricanes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
any small Leak within, one Spark in
the Gun-room, nay one wry step is sufficient
to dispatch a man, and send him quick in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
another World. And can any one in
his right senses reflect upon these things,
and yet neglect <hi>the working out his salvation
with fear and trembling?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Philip. 2. 12.</note> Consider but in
what an Amazement must that wretched
man be, who passes immediately with Oaths
and Execrations in his mouth, to make his
appearance before the Judgment-Seat of
Christ; What a surprize must it needs be
unto him, when he awakens in another
World, and begins then to <hi>call upon his God</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:49609:8"/>
when he can expect no other Answer than,
<hi>I know you not,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 25. 41.</note> 
               <hi>depart from me you wicked into
everlasting fire, prepared for the Devil and his
Angels!</hi> Again,</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Frequency</hi> of the dangers, they are
yet more formidable; because this will
certainly convince you that these sad Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
are not only possible, but common
unto men, and that for ought any one
knows to the contrary his own turn is next.
Now that the dangers which sea-faring men
are exposed to are frequent and common,
and do ordinarily happen unto them, there
needs no other Argument to convince you
than your own experience of them; the
many rescues you have had out of the very
Jaws of Death, those many, and even mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous,
deliverances which you cannot
but be sensible of, and which have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
to you even then when all hopes of
escape seemed to be quite taken away. I
should not have mentioned this particular,
but that I am afraid it is an opinion too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
amongst you, That since the great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements
of Navigation, and the daily
advancement of Knowledge in Sea-affairs,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49609:9"/>
the Ocean is now rendred so passable and
secure, that the Accidents seem not to exceed
those which men in general are exposed to;
and yet out of your own mouths may you
be convinced, since it is hardly possibly to
find one sea-faring man, who is not able
to recount as many dangers as voyages, and
does not after a long and perillous absence
from home, esteem it almost a resurrection
from the dead to recover his native Shore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
            <p>Now if these things were but once
throughly considered and laid to heart, one
would think it almost impossible there
should be any such Monster in the World
as a loose and irreligious Sea-man, and that
these are they of all men who <hi>live soberly,
righteously and godly in this present world,</hi> who
pray continually,<note place="margin">Qui nescit ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, discat navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gare.</note> and call upon their God,
and are least obnoxious to inconsideration
and stupidity; that these are they who live
in a perpetual sense of the protecting Arm
of God, and a continual dread of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
<hi>in whom,</hi> after an extraordinary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<hi>they live and move, and have their being,</hi>
and that if this sort of warfare cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49609:9"/>
men, <hi>neither will they be perswaded though
one should rise</hi> to them <hi>from the dead;</hi> there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nothing in this World which in its own
nature can tend more to the awakening of
mens minds, and bring them over into the
ways of Religion and Vertue, than that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillous
state <hi>they</hi> live in, through the <hi>sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
the <hi>number</hi> and <hi>frequency</hi> of those cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
which are always incident to sea-faring
men. I come therefore to shew,</p>
            <p>II. What great encouragement you have
to call upon God, from the consideration of
his especial Providence over Sea-affairs; <hi>If
so be that God will think upon us, that we perish
not.</hi> And whoever considers how full and
express the Scriptures are in the declaration
of this truth, he will at the same time be
inclined to think, That though Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
and <hi>his mercy are over all his works,</hi> yet
the great strokes of his Divine Arm are
made most manifest in the Deep. For he
it is <hi>who commandeth and raiseth the stormy wind,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 107. 25.</note>
               <hi>which lifteth up the waves of the Sea.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 33. 7.</note> 
               <hi>He ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth
the waters of the Sea together as an heap,
and layeth up the depth in his store-houses;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 65. 7.</note> 
               <hi>he tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
upon the waves of the Sea, and stilleth the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49609:10"/>
noise of the Seas,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 89. 9.</note> 
               <hi>and the noise of their waves; he
ruleth the raging of the Sea, and when the waves
thereof arise,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 5. 22.</note> 
               <hi>he stilleth them. Fear ye not me,
saith the Lord? will ye not tremble at my presence,
which have placed the Sand for the Bound of the
Sea, by a perpetual Decree, that it cannot pass
it, and though the waves thereof toss themselves,
yet can they not prevail, though they roar, yet can
they not pass over it?</hi> And what an encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
must it needs be to serve and fear
that God, who is thus able to think upon
you that you perish not? It cannot but be
highly your concern to engage this Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
on your side, which is only able to
deliver you, unless you can pretend like
<hi>Xerxes</hi> to stop the raging of the Sea,<note place="margin">Herodotus.</note> by
casting Manacles and Fetters into the <hi>Helle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spont;</hi>
which he was as able to perform as
thou art to <hi>bind the sweet influences of Pleiades,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 38. 31.</note>
               <hi>or loose the bands of Orion.</hi> Alas! these are the
Ordinances of Heaven, and from hence
alone must we expect to be delivered out of
our distress. But tell me, O wretched man,
whoever thou art, that art not used to <hi>call
upon thy God</hi> but in thy Oaths and Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
which way canst thou promise to thy
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49609:10"/>
self security, whilst thou thinkest thus to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
God, and defie the Almighty when he
hath got thee fast (if I may so speak) in the
very Element of his wrath. <hi>What meanest
thou, O Sleeper?</hi> Dost thou presumptuously
go on because thy misfortunes hitherto have
not been worse than other mens?<note place="margin">Rom. 2. 4, 5. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Despisest
thou the riches of God's goodness, and forbearance,
and long suffering; not knowing that the goodness
of God should lead thee to repentance? but after
thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thy self wrath against the day of wrath, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
of the righteous judgment of God, who
(when the Sea shall give up her dead) will ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to every man according to his deeds.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Apoc. 20. 13.</note> 'Tis
true, how much soever we call upon our
God, yet on the other hand may we still
fail of a deliverance, and there is no reason
to expect that the event must punctually
answer our desires, unless we were as able
to judge for our selves as infinite wisdom it
self is. But although ordinarily it cannot
be supposed that every good man should
hear the voice of God (whose he is, and
whom he serves) speaking to him after the
same manner as once to the Apostle Saint
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49609:11"/>
               <hi>Paul; Fear not,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 27. 24.</note> 
               <hi>thou must be brought before Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar,
and lo I have given thee all them that sail
with thee;</hi> though, I say, it were unjustifiable
thus to presume upon extraordinary acts
of Providence, yet does it not at all follow
from hence that good men are not entituled
to the mercies and deliverances of God, and
the bad are not sometimes examples of his
vengeance. This is plainly acknowledged
by the Philosopher, when he bespoke his
wretched Companions after this manner,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, &amp;c.
Hold your peace (says he) lest the gods
knowing that you sail with us, we all pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
for your sakes.</p>
            <p>III. I come now to answer some Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
which this Discourse may be thought
liable unto. And the most plausible that I
can think of are these that follow:</p>
            <p>1. That Religion is apt to inject fear
into mens minds, which must needs render
it very improper for sea-faring men.</p>
            <p>2. It will take up too much of your
time, and slacken your endeavours in cases
of imminent danger.</p>
            <p>3. That the Knowledge of the Seas is
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49609:11"/>
rather apt to draw men off from the belief
of a God and Providence, than to settle
and establish them in it.</p>
            <p>And if these things be so, I have lost my
labour, all my advice is in vain. But let
us see of what force these Objections are,
before we and our Religion so easily part.
And,</p>
            <p>1. 'Tis said, That Religion is apt to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
fear into mens minds, which must
needs render it very improper for sea-faring
men. For, it being already granted that
throughout the whole visible Creation,
there is not to be found such another Scene
of astonishing dangers, as men sometimes
meet with out at Sea; when they are on
all sides terrified with grim Messengers of
death, and, as the Psalmist well expresseth
it,<note place="margin">Psal. 107. 27.</note> 
               <hi>they reel to and fro, and stagger like a drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
man, and are at their wits end:</hi> It will then
follow, that they of all men in the World
have at such time the greatest need of an
undaunted courage, and a bold and resolute
mind. But this cannot otherwise be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
than by casting off all apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Death and Hell, and a Judgment to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49609:12"/>
come; which will so infeeble mens minds
and prey upon their Spirits, that the effect
of dwelling upon such thoughts will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appear to be an heartless and despairing
condition; and since it were the best way
to overlook all those terrours which are so
visible about us, what reason is there that
we should create new ones which are not
seen, and raise a more formidable enemy
within our selves. In answer to this,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> I yield partly to what the Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
supposes, That bad men when their
lives are in real danger, have the terrours
of the Lord upon them, and a fearful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of a Judgment to come: and if
men will venture out at Sea with evil ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits
about them, and laden with iniquity,
there is no help for it if the fears of Death
and a Judgment consequent upon it, shall na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
accompany and overset them. There
is no other possible remedy in this case
but one, and that is, That such men would
deal by their sins, as the Mariners in the
Verse before my Text were forced to do
by their wares, get rid of them as speedily
as they can, that by so doing they may
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49609:12"/>
lighten the Vessel,<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 1.</note> and having <hi>laid aside eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset
them, they may run with patience that race which
is set before them.</hi> But then,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> On the other hand, it is as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that nothing inspires men more with
true courage and bravery of resolution than
Religion and Vertue. For when men have
got at liberty from their Lusts, and are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Masters of themselves, and have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned
the soft Paths of ease and luxury;
as in times of the greatest difficulty and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard,
they will far exceed other men in sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacity
and presence of mind (and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
in a happy discovery of the best
means of escape) so will they also truly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
better inabled to undergo the worst of
hardships, and to weather out the most vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent
Storms: and whereas the wicked are
full of inward disconsolations and fearful a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodings,
which so distract their minds, that
they are already sunk in despair; the vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
man is secure of God's Providence on
his side, and is certainly assured, That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the success of his endeavours be, he
shall be still on the victorious Party: for he
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49609:13"/>
well knows that that God whom he serves
will either deliver him out of his present ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities,
or will bring him to his last, his
best and most desired Haven. And now
what is there that shall be able to dismantle
the spirit of a man thus fortified? or rob
him of his resolution and his courage? both
which, like a wise man, he hath founded
upon a Rock,<note place="margin">Matth. 7. 24, 25.</note> and <hi>let the rain descend, the
floods come, and the winds beat upon him,</hi> 'tis to
no purpose, <hi>they can never fall,</hi> for <hi>he hath
built them upon a Rock.</hi> On the contrary,
how does Vice naturally tend to debase
mens spirits, and render them cowardly
and effeminate, unfit to sustain those many
(and oftentimes lasting) severities which a
sea-warfare does expose them to; either
through foulness of weather, inhumanity
of strangers, scarcity and badness of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision,
indisposition of body passing through
various Climes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and, what is worse
than all these outward calamities, (to make
up the vicious mans condition compleatly
miserable) he hath also a galled Conscience
within, and is so continually tossed with
restless and perplexing thoughts, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49609:13"/>
               <hi>like the troubled Sea before him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isai. 57. 20.</note> 
               <hi>which
cannot rest, and whose waters cast up mire and
dirt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have the longer insisted upon this Point,
because I am sensible I speak to those who,
of all men living, are the most jealous of
their courage and fortitude, and therefore
shall not be blamed by you, if I establish
them upon their true foundations. But
then,</p>
            <p>2. It is urged, That Religion will take
up too much of your time, and slacken your
endeavours in cases of imminent danger.
In times of fatal concern, when the unruly
Element becomes boisterous and ungover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
and plays with the goodliest Vessel
as easily as the Leviathan sports with an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty
Cask; when all on a sudden the Ocean
becomes a confused Chaos, heighth and
depth, light and darkness are mingled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
then, when all hands should be at
work, and every pull seems to be the last
tug for life; then, I say, for a man to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
himself to his prayers, or with the
Prophet, go down into the sides of the Ship<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
there lay himself down to sleep (though
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49609:14"/>
perhaps the next moment it may prove his
last) or, what is much the same thing,
there fling himself wholly upon Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection,
rely upon his Providence, and rest
assured that nothing but a Divine hand can
save and deliver him: what is this but to
render men useless in their Arts, insensible
of their danger, and even to betray them
out of their lives? and if this be the effect of
calling upon God, it were as good men
should shipwrack their faith as themselves.</p>
            <p>In reply to this, S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul</hi>'s Rule holds
good,<note place="margin">2 Thess. 3. 10.</note> That <hi>if any would not work, neither
should they eat.</hi> Idleness and sloth, vain pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
and causeless security are so far
from being countenanced by Religion,
that it lays the greatest obligations upon
men to the contrary. It charges diligence
and industry upon mens Consciences, and
lets them know that they must one day give
a severe account for the misuse of that time
which once lost can never be regained; it
tells them, That though they should be
careless of themselves, yet no consideration
ought to make them prodigal of the lives of
other men,<note place="margin">Eccles. 9. 2.</note> where <hi>all things must happen alike
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49609:14"/>
to all, and there will be but one event to the righteous
and to the wicked, to him that sweareth, and to
him that feareth an Oath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now what hinders that men cannot
reconcile their business and their devotions
together, and let their minds be well em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
however their Bodies are exercised?
Sure I am, this would be so far from hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
you in your labours, how urgent and
pressing soever they may be, that it will
make you undergo them with much greater
alacrity and cheerfulness of mind and sweet
hopes of success; for to entertain serious
thoughts, to put up a prayer to God, and
with the Disciples of our Lord to cry out
<hi>Lord save us, we perish,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 8. 25.</note> will add a great Spur
to your endeavours. I come now,</p>
            <p>3. To consider, Whether the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Seas is rather apt to draw men
off from the belief of a God and Providence,
than to settle and confirm them in it. This
Objection, I confess, is home to the business,
and if this be true, what I have already said
may pass for nothing. But let us examine
those Reasons which seem to prop up this
Opinion; and they are these that follow:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:49609:15"/>
               <hi>First,</hi> That by the Knowledge of the
Seas men discover many useless parts of the
Creation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> They get considerable Instances
against the universality of the Notion of
God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That by the Knowledge of the Seas
are discovered many useless parts of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.
This hath been frequent in the
mouths of bad men, and is an opinion which
their old Champion <hi>Lucretius</hi> hath so garnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and tricked up with Poetry, that the gild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Pill hath passed very glibly with loose
and inconsidering men. What use of the
torrid and frigid Zones? to what purpose
serve the barren Deserts, inaccessible
Mountains and craggy Rocks? will not the
Sea willingly resign up her Hurricanes, and
<hi>Afric</hi> spare all her Monsters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus is
God's Providence called in question, and his
infinite Wisdom arraigned; nay the bolder
sort scoff at the workmanship of his hands,
and take up that blasphemous Speech of the
insolent Spaniard, <hi>Si Creationi affuissem, Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum
melius ordinâssem:</hi> had I been present at
the making of the World, I could have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:49609:15"/>
things after a better sort.</p>
            <p>Now, besides that the torrid Zone is
well known by you to be habitable, and a
considerable part also of the frigid, and that
both serve very wise ends and purposes; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
this, the inclination of the Axis of the
Earth is so admirably proportioned for the
making it as habitable as possible, that the
joint wit of mankind is not able to imagine
the least circumstance in which it might have
been mended. And for those other things
which seem so hurtful to the World, though
it were sufficient to reply in the words of
the Son of <hi>Sirach,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ecclus. 39. 28; 29.</note> That <hi>there be Spirits that
are created for vengeance, which in their fury lay
on sore strokes, in the time of destruction, they
pour out their force and appease the wrath of him
that made them; fire and hail, famine and death,
all these were created for vengeance:</hi> though, I
say, there needs no other Answer than this,
yet I think it sufficient once for all to know,
That things of admirable use in themselves
may to our understandings appear quite
otherwise, and to be of no use at all. Of
which take this considerable Instance; There
was a time not many Ages ago, when the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49609:16"/>
World no doubt esteemed of the Magnet
no more than of a despicable Stone, part
of the Rubbish of the Creation, or at best
but some of the Ballast of the Globe; but
I need not tell you (to borrow the words of<note place="margin">Bishop <hi>Ward</hi>'s Essay of the immortality of the Soul.</note>
a learned Prelate of our Church) how by
the application of a Needle to this Stone
you get the mastery of the unruly Ocean,
ride securely upon the back of the dark wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and make it supply the place of the
Stars in Heaven; how by the help of this
you examine all the Chambers of the Sun,
and imitate him in compassing the World;
how you go out at the East and teturn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
from the West, return laden with the
Treasuries of the World; how by the help
of this you settle a correspondence betwixt
the most distant places of the World, and
open a traffick between Nations concealed
from the knowledge of one another almost
ever since the floating of the Ark. But
what do I speak of these things? By the assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of this you display the Banner of
Christ in the Regions of Death and Hell,
and shed forth the glorious light of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
to the people that <hi>sit in darkness,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 1. 79.</note> 
               <hi>and in
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:49609:16"/>
the shadow of Death.</hi> Now what sensible a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalogy
or correspondence is there betwixt a
Stone and these glorious effects which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from it? This Instance alone might
be sufficient to confound the sinful curiosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of men, and stop the mouth of the
most plausible Gainsayer. I come there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> To consider the remaining part
of the Objection, which is, That by the
knowledg of the Seas men get considerable
Instances against the universality of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a God, and upon that account are
inclinable to be drawn off from the belief
of his Being. For it cannot be denied that
upon some Eastern, but especially Western,
Discoveries there have been found a sort of
people amongst whom it was difficult,
if at all possible, to discern the least foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps
of Religion, or any notices of a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Being; which, say they, is a plain
reason that the Notion of a Deity is not
congenite, because not common and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
to mankind. But granting as much
as this Objection supposes, That there are
to be found such rude and barbarous people
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:49609:17"/>
in the World that just differ from beasts on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by a scanty language and a humane
shape, so far unskilled in Arts, and the most
obvious deductions from sense, as to want
Logick sufficient to clothe their nakedness,
or but tolerably purvey for their Stomachs;
granting, I say, there are such men to be
found, who know nothing in the World
beyond themselves, and are perfectly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
God in the World; yet will it not from
hence follow, that amongst people whose
minds are used to consideration, and their
faculties duly exercised, any one national
Instance of the like nature can be found:
sufficient it is, that as soon as we are able to
approve our selves men by the use and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of our reason and understanding, the
Notion of a God becomes so agreeable to
us, that our Nature seems to stand bent that
way, and we cannot deny the one without
using violence to the other.</p>
            <p>And now, having done with what I at
first proposed to speak unto, give me leave
to apply this Discourse by offering to your
consideration these two things:</p>
            <p>1. The especial Providence of God to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49609:17"/>
this Nation in relation to Sea-affairs.</p>
            <p>2. What suitable returns were proper for
you to make for so great benefits which he
hath done unto you.</p>
            <p>1. Consider the especial Providence of
God to this Nation in relation to Sea-affairs.
And whether we consider the scituation of
our Country, the temper of our Climate,
the advantage of our Shipping, or the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and constitution of our Trade, we have
every where great reason to bless God, and
to acknowledge he hath not dealt so with
many Nations.</p>
            <p>By the scituation of our Country we are
encompassed with Seas, surrounded every
where with commodious Havens. If we
turn our faces to the South, there is a vast
prospect before us, and unknown Regions
call upon us; the Northern Parts are our
Neighbours and Acquaintance, and on the
one hand we have the old World, and on
the other the new. So that our Island seems
by Providence designed to be the very Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Navigation and Trade, and that it shall
one day be the glory of our great City what
was anciently that of <hi>Tyre,</hi> That the <hi>Harvest
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49609:18"/>
of the River is her revenues,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isai. 23. 3.</note> 
               <hi>and She is the Mart
of Nations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The temper of our Climate is so auspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
that as we are not scorched on the one
hand, so neither are we frozen on the other,
but enjoy a seasonable and moderate revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of heat and cold; the great advantages
of which, you that are continually passing
through several Climes are much more sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of than I can be; how by this means
you become better enabled to endure extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
of Zones, and by your happy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions
seem to be so equally disposed for
all places, that you may every one challenge
upon a natural account, what the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
did upon a moral, the reputation of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Citizens of the World. But alas! how
would the <hi>Russian</hi> dissolve under the Line,
and a Native of <hi>Guinea</hi> grow stiff upon the
Coasts of <hi>Spitsberge?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the advantages of our Shipping we so
exceedingly surpass all others, that beside,
that the most fundamental and necessary
parts thereof are the growth of our own Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests,
we do also for art and workmanship
(as God once taught <hi>Bezaleel</hi> and <hi>Aboliab</hi> their<note place="margin">Exod. 31. 3.</note>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:49609:18"/>
skill) seem to be instructed from above, and
our Axes and Hammers Divinely taught to
do their work.</p>
            <p>And when I have given to God the things
which are his, the glory and the praise; it
cannot be thought unreasonable to give <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>
his due, under whose kindly influence
and protection Navigation seems to be
grown up to its perfect stature, who not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
(after the example of the wisest of Kings)
gives order in our <hi>Ezion-geber</hi> for a Royal
Navy,<note place="margin">1 Kings 9. 26.</note> but (what the Scriptures mention
not of him) is himself also a Master-build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and in this Instance is a truer representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of the great Architect of the World
than all the Princes in Christendome beside,
who can in the same language instruct his
Artificers with which God appointed the
Patriarch to build his Ark,<note place="margin">Gen. 6. 14, 15.</note> 
               <hi>This is the fashion
which thou shalt make it of, these are the rooms
which you shall make in it, this shall be the length,
and breadth, and heighth thereof, and thus shall you
pitch it within and without.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The nature and constitution of our Trade
is such, that it promises a lasting endurance,
and the fairest hopes of a yet further advance,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49609:19"/>
Traffick being setled with us upon as sure
and solid foundations as the encouragement
of a most Gracious Prince, and the best
compacted Societies can bestow upon it.</p>
            <p>I am not ignorant that this last is so far
from being reckoned a priviledge by some,
that they account it the great <hi>remora</hi> of
Trade: I presume not to enter into the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of the Cause, it being as much beside
my business, as it is beyond my skill; but it
is to be feared the great outcry for liberty of
<hi>Trade</hi> is near of kin to that for liberty of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi>
which to our sorrows we have expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced
was only a politick fetch of a Party
to lay all in common, till such time as they
could get sufficient power and strength to
inclose all for themselves, then change their
Note, and much more stifly oppose that
common benefit for which they themselves
were so lately Advocates. But on which
side soever the advantage lyes, this is sure,
That the ancient Glory of <hi>Tyre</hi> is become
the present condition of this Nation, since
our <hi>Merchants are Princes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isal. 23. 8.</note> 
               <hi>and our Traffickers
the Honourable of the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Let us consider, What suitable returns
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:49609:19"/>
were proper for you to make for all these be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
which God hath done unto you. And
I think you cannot give a greater and more
proper demonstration of your thankfulness
for these so great mercies, than the sincere
practice of these following Duties:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> A zealous endeavour after the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation
of true Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Walking honestly towards them
which are without. And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> A thankful remembrance of the
dangers you have escaped.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> A zealous endeavour after the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation
of true Religion. This is the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest
end of Navigation, and the most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
Plantation you can make, to spread
the glorious light of the Gospel, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
men from the powers of Hell and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
it will consecrate all your Returns
from abroad,<note place="margin">Isai. 23. 18.</note> and render your <hi>merchandise ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
unto the Lord;</hi> and what more suitable
return can you make unto God for his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold
blessings bestowed upon you, than to
make your selves Instruments of <hi>turning men
from Idols to serve</hi> that <hi>living God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Thess. 1. 9.</note> And that
you may not be unready <hi>always to give an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Pet. 3. 15.</note>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:49609:20"/>
               <hi>to every man that asketh you a reason of the
hope that is in you,</hi> the excellent <hi>Grotius</hi> hath
furnished you with invincible Arguments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Gentile, Jew and Mahometan;
and to make up that Armour compleat, you
may find lately added unto it a Shield of the
true Faith, wherewith you shall be able <hi>to
quench all the fiery Darts</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ephes. 6. 16.</note>
How much more proper a Companion
would this be for you, where by Calms and
contrary Winds you are sometimes put to it
for diversions, than such unmanly exercises
which tend only to the scandal of your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
the corrupting of your Constitutions,
and the eternal perdition of your souls? But,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Another proper return to God for
his benefits unto you, would be a walking
honestly towards them which are without.
To preserve, as the Apostle speaks, a good
Conscience, by having your conversation ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
among the Gentiles;<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 12.</note> that <hi>whereas they speak
against you as evil Doers, they may by your good
works which they shall behold, glorifie God in the
day of visitation.</hi> For when all is done a good
life is the best Argument in the World<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor
can you bring greater Glory to God, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:49609:20"/>
worse scandal from our most holy Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
than by letting <hi>your light so shine before men;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 5. 16.</note>
               <hi>that they may see your good works, and glorifie your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
which is in Heaven.</hi> For, as one out of his own
experience hath observed,<note place="margin">Acosta, lib. 4. cap. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Quod Barbari fidem
nostram de moribus judicant; proclivius quippe est
quod videas credere, quam quod audias, &amp; rarò per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suadet
factis sermo contrarius:</hi> That the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
people do always judge of our Faith ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to our lives, it being much easier to
give credit to what a man sees, than what he
hears, and rarely will that discourse perswade
which is accompanied with contrary actions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> and lastly, A thankful remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of the dangers you have escaped is a
most proper return to make to God for all the
wonders of his mercy. There are many of
you here, such lasting Monuments of Gods
Providence, that in a good old Age, you can
perhaps reckon more dangers you have esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
than you can summ up years; O therefore
<hi>praise the Lord for his goodness,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 107. 8.</note> 
               <hi>and his wonders
that he doth for the Children of men.</hi> Let no mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
of his love escape your notice, but let e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one of them find some room in your
Journals, that you may know how good and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:49609:21"/>
gracious the Lord hath been unto you. This
is a just Sacrifice of praises and thanksgivings,
yet <hi>I will have mercy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hos. 6. 6.</note> saith the Lord, <hi>and not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
i. e.</hi> God is well pleased with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
when it becomes a means and cause of
the latter. And indeed your Alms are the
best <hi>memorial that can come up before God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 10. 4.</note> who
for his mercies to us hath enjoined us pity and
compassion to our Brethren,<note place="margin">Matth. 25. 40.</note> for <hi>in as much as
you have done it unto one of the least of these my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
you have done it unto me,</hi> saith our Saviour.
But what need I animate this worthy Society,
and provoke a Duty so good and acceptable
to you, for your works already praise you, and
the prayers of the poor and destitute do light
upon you. May their prayers and your bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
still accompany each other, till at last
you come to hear that joyful <hi>Euge,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 25. 34, 35.</note> 
               <hi>Come ye bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for
you from the foundation of the world. For I was an
hungred, and ye gave me meat; I was thirsty, and ye
gave me drink, &amp;c.</hi> Now to God the Father,
God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost, to the
ever blessed and glorious Trinity, three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
and one God, be all honour and praise
now and for evermore. <hi>Amen.</hi>
