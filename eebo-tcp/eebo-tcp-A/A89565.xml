            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>This terrible judgement is laid downe in two compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: one of a great river, or the ſea, that had broke over all his banks, a floud ſhould ſpread over all their land, and reach up to the very neck; the other compariſon is of an Eagle or fowl of prey, he ſhould come and ſpread his wings over the breadth of the whole land; the whole land of <hi>Iudea</hi> ſhould at one time be overſpread by the mighty Army that <hi>Senacherib</hi> (whom they expected to be their Saviour) ſhould bring upon them with a purpoſe to deſtroy them; and in the cloſe of this threatning, there is an elegant Apoſtrophe, he turns his ſpeech to Chriſt, he ſhal ſpread his wings over the breadth of <hi>thy land, O Immanuel;</hi> though it be thy land and thy people, <hi>O Emma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel,</hi> yet becauſe of their unbelief all this ſhall come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. This turning of his ſpeech to Chriſt ſeems to be an indignity to Chriſt, that his land, under the notion of <hi>his</hi> land ſhould be waſted by ſuch a wicked King, but this appears to be added for two ends, one to ſignifie the certainty of the judgement, all that could poſſibly be pleaded, why there ſhould be any hope of keeping off the judgement was <hi>Emmanuels</hi> title to this land, but it ſhall come though it be <hi>Emmanuels</hi> land; ſecondly, this is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as a ſecret ground of comfort of deliverance, becauſe
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:161703:5"/>
it was the land of <hi>Emmanuel,</hi> the land and people where <hi>Emmanuel</hi> was to be borne, and where he was to reign, where he had and would have his fire and furnace, his ſeat <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nd habitation, therefore their faith may expect delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: theſe are the two firſt parts of the Chapter; now my Text containes the third, which is the deliverance which the Lord would give them notwithſtanding their great unworthineſſe; but before I come to that, let me name this one leſſon, from the other two parts, namely,</p>
            <p>That it is ordinary with God, when his people doe <note place="margin">Obſerv.</note> forſake his promiſes, and truſt to an arme of fleſh, he makes that arme of fleſh to bee their ſcourge, which they expected to be their helper; they had nothing that they would truſt to againſt theſe two neighbouring Kingdomes, but the power of the King of <hi>Aſsyria,</hi> and this King of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> ſhoud be their ſcourge to beat and almoſt to breake them in pieces: which is notably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28. 20, 21. <hi>Ahaz</hi> ſent all the treaſure he could rap and rend, thereby to ingage the King of <hi>Aſſyria. And Tilgath-Pilneſer the King of</hi> Aſſyria <hi>came to him, and diſtreſſed him, but ſtrengthned him not, he helped him not:</hi> therefore</p>
            <p>Let us learne, that when we do truſt either to any <note place="margin">
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</note> nation, to any Army, or to any Councell, and relie up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, with with-drawing our ſelves from the grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous promiſes of God, we take the ready way to bring ruine and deſtruction upon our ſelves.</p>
            <p>The third part of the Chapter, is that which I intend <note place="margin">The Text ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> by the Lords aſſiſtance to treat upon; and that is, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance which the Lord was pleaſed to promiſe this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy people in this 9, and 10. verſes: for the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding whereof I would open two things; Firſt,</p>
            <p>The matter contained in theſe two verſes: Secondly,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:161703:6"/>
The manner, how the Lord is pleaſed to lay this down, and expreſſe it:</p>
            <p>The matter of the two verſes, containes theſe three Heads: Firſt,</p>
            <p>Here is a great conſpiracie againſt the Church of God: Secondly,</p>
            <p>Here is an eminent deliverance of the Church from this conſpiracy: Thirdly,</p>
            <p>Here is both the author of the deliverance, and the cauſe, why they ſhould be delivered.</p>
            <p>The conſpiracie againſt them, is laid downe in theſe branches; Firſt,</p>
            <p>Here is the multitude of people, that were engaged in it, called, <hi>ye people, and ye of far Countries;</hi> a great many of them: Secondly,</p>
            <p>Here is their <hi>aſſociation,</hi> their meeting about their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe; <hi>gather your ſelves together, aſſociate your ſelves</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2.</note> ye people, come and meet: Thirdly,</p>
            <p>Here is the Aſſociation of their <hi>Councell; take counſell together;</hi> contribute every one what you are able to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <note place="margin">3.</note> this deſigne: Fourthly,</p>
            <p>Here is their agreement in the <hi>Concluſion; Speake the word,</hi> ſet it poſitively downe, <hi>nemine contradicente,</hi> this <note place="margin">4.</note> is the buſineſſe we will doe, and carry it on as one man: then</p>
            <p>Here is the preparation likewiſe of their <hi>Armes; Gird your ſelves,</hi> doe not only meet, and talke and agree, but <note place="margin">5.</note> arme, and march, and goe on with your buſineſſe; all this is the preparation to the plot: Secondly,</p>
            <p>Here is the defeat of this plot, and that is very nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, even the diſſipating of their counſells, the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine <note place="margin">2.</note> of all their enterprizes; Aſſociate your ſelves, <hi>but ye ſhall be broken;</hi> gird your ſelves, <hi>but ye ſhall be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken;</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:161703:6"/>
take counſell, <hi>but it ſhall come to nought;</hi> ſpeak the word, ſet downe your concluſion, that you'l never part from, yet all ſhall not ſtand, all ſhall be a vain thing, it ſhall not onely not take effect, but returne upon your owne heads, to your owne ruine, ye ſhall be broken in pieces: Thirdly,</p>
            <p>Here is the Authour of it, and in the Author the <note place="margin">3.</note> cauſe; for <hi>God is with us:</hi> the Hebrew is, for <hi>Emmanuel;</hi> gather your ſelves, gird your ſelves, take counſell, ſpeak the word, all ſhall come to nought, for <hi>Emanuel;</hi> that is, for it is <hi>Emmanuels</hi> cauſe that you oppoſe, it is <hi>Emmanu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els</hi> people, that you fight againſt; it is <hi>Emmanuel</hi> who is the Leader, the Generall of that Army, one that will out-wit you, and out-plot you, and out-fight you, one for whom you are too few, and he alone will be too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny for you, it is againſt Chriſt, and you doe but kick a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the prickes; this is the matter of theſe two verſes: then, Secondly,</p>
            <p>Note likewiſe the manner, how the Lord is pleaſed <note place="margin">2.</note> to lay this downe; which is done by ſeverall rhetoricall, and figurative expreſſions: as Firſt,</p>
            <p>Here is an Apoſtophe; though the ſpeech bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <note place="margin">1.</note> to his people, yet the Lord turnes himſelfe to the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> who were comming againſt them; <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociate your ſelves, ye people, harken all ye of far Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries:</hi> Secondly,</p>
            <p>It is laid down in the way of an Irony, and of a Sarca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſme, <note place="margin">2.</note> a bitter ſcoffe, the Prophet ſets down this whole buſineſſe by way of contempt of theſe enemies, that were ingaged in the buſineſſe; as if hee ſhould have ſaid thus, <hi>I know your devices, you have concluded what you'l doe againſt</hi> Ieruſalem, <hi>ingage you will,</hi> well <hi>be doing,</hi> goe <hi>on with your buſineſſe, point your rendezvouz,</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:161703:7"/>
carry your Troopes and Regiments compleat with you, take an Oath of them all, reſolve what you'l doe, try your skill, doe your utmoſt, but it won't hold, it won't doe, you are too weak, you'l bee broken, you'l bee daſhed; Thus in a way of ſcorn the Lord is pleaſed to lay down this whole buſineſſe, and hee chuſes this manner of expreſſing of it, partly, that hee might thereby upbraid the confidence of the Enemy, who thought their buſineſſe was ſo ſure, that no check, much leſſe checkmate ſhould ever bee given them; you thinke you are very ſure of your buſineſſe, you make no queſtion of carrying the day: and partly, in it hee would expreſſe likewiſe, the holy confidence of the Prophet, and with the Prophet of all the people of God, when they have got a promiſe from God, that they can under the Lords protection, ſecurely looke upon all the preparations that their enemies make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them; for as it is the ſpeach of <hi>God,</hi> ſo it is the ſpeech of the <hi>Church, Immanuel,</hi> God is with <hi>us,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doe your worſt againſt us, wee feare you not: this I take to be the ſumme and the meaning of the words; Now out of the words many excellent inſtructions might bee learned: I intend but one, though I ſhall point at ſeverall others: as Firſt,</p>
            <p>From the conſpiracy that was in all theſe people, thus aſſociating their perſons, their counſels, their trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, their armes, all for the ruine of the Church, and people of God; wee may obſerve the wonderfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent that is found in the enemies of <hi>Zion,</hi> to ruin and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy it: learn I ſay, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Obſer.</hi> 1. There is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and unitie in the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Church in their oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition againſt it.</note>
            </p>
            <p>That <hi>there is a Concord, Harmony, and Vnity of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and endeavors in the enemies of the Church, to bring ruine and deſtruction upon it.</hi> This is a truth that I ſhall
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:161703:7"/>
not need to prove, all the ages of the World have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſufficient proof of it; Satan and his inſtruments have appear'd in many ſhapes, ſometime in the ſhape of a <hi>Lion,</hi> ſometimes of a great <hi>red Dragon,</hi> ſometimes of a <hi>ſubtle Fox,</hi> ſometimes in the ſhape of an <hi>innocent Lambe;</hi> but what ever their ſhape bee, their purpoſe and worke hath ever been to make warre againſt the woman and her ſeed, to endeavour by all means poſſible, the ruine of the people of God, purſuing it with dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fury, and powring out flouds of malice and rage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it. I know it could not be burthenſome, if I ſhould a little open the ſeverall wayes, that they have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; <note place="margin">The ſeverall wayes how they attempt it.</note> ſome more ſpirituall, ſome more carnall. Some more ſpirituall, one while indeavoring to corrupt their lives, by drawing them to wickedneſſe: ſometimes to corrupt their faith, by drawing them to blaſphemies or hereſies: ſometimes to corrupt their worſhip, by tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it with idolatry and ſuperſtition: ſometimes to break their union, by interrupting them with ſchiſmes and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions: at other times to interrupt and breake their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall liberty, by putting bonds and yokes upon them, contrary to the Word; and at other times by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward means, by perſecutions and open hoſtilities, by all the terrors, and threats, whatſoever the hand, and tongue, and intereſt, and power of the Devill, and all his inſtruments could ever bring to paſſe, they never have ceaſed to endeavour by all poſſible meanes to deſtroy <hi>Immanuels</hi> people; this is a knowne truth.</p>
            <p>The true ground is onely that inbred enmity and <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reaſon.</hi> From their enmity againſt it.</note> oppoſition that is in the heart of all the ſeed of the Serpent againſt the ſeed of the woman, though no good reaſon at all, can be given why it ſhould be ſo, yet <hi>non</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 15. Which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from three cauſes.</note> 
               <hi>amote, nec poſſum dicere quare;</hi> they doe not love them,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:161703:8"/>
they hate them, they muſt endevour to deſtroy them; there is an enmity againſt them: but yet becauſe no hatred found amongſt rationall creatures, is without (at leaſt) ſome pretence of Reaſon, know yee that the Reaſon of their hatred, is grounded upon ſuch things as theſe; the one is,</p>
            <p>That the Church of Chriſt, is a terrible plague and <note place="margin">1.</note> vexation to all the reſt of the World; I ſay, there is not ſuch a plague to all the people of the world, as the Church of Chriſt is, and as Gods people are, becauſe the lawes and rules by which they walke, doe threaten no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ruine and deſtruction, to all thoſe that walke in other wayes; other people in the ſeverall wayes they walke in, if you let them alone in their wayes, they will allow you to promiſe your ſelfe what you will in your wayes, their religions, and courſes are good fellowes one to another, they can beare with them in their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; but the people of God doe hold out that, which muſt bee the onely rule, and they tell all the world, that if they walke not according to their rule one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they will be damned, and deſtroyed eternally, and ſo they vex them; and therefore one notes well, that when <hi>Tiberius</hi> the Emperour of <hi>Rome,</hi> having heard of the miracles of Chriſt, did propound to the Senate of <hi>Rome,</hi> that Chriſt might bee worſhipped as a God, as well as their other Gods were, the Senate upon ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conſultation rejected it, becauſe (they ſaid) if they entertain'd him, they muſt caſt out all the reſt, hee would ſuffer none to bee God but himſelf; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in ſtead of owning him to bee one of theirs, they perſecuted him, and owned all the reſt: So it is, the two witneſſes you read of, <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. vexed all the men that lived upon the earth, by their Propheſies, all the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:161703:8"/>
of God by their rules, their faith, their lives, their worſhip, &amp;c. Throw fire and brimſtone in the faces of others, and therefore no wonder though they bee ſo bitterly hated and oppoſed Againe, another ground is,</p>
            <p>That which Jeſus Chriſt expreſſes, <hi>hee hath choſen his</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2.</note> 
               <hi>people out of the World,</hi> as out of a baſe, vile, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane <note place="margin">Iohn 15. 19. Iohn 17. 14.</note> company, and upon his thus chooſing, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, they in their whole converſation and garbe, doe leave the reſt of the world, as unclean, vile and baſe; and there can be nothing ſo odious to a people as to bee ſo left: If there were ſome amongſt our ſelves whoſe whole worke and endeavour ſhould bee to leave <hi>England,</hi> and carry away all that they have out of it, as from a baſe people, and unworthy to bee loved or dwels withall, and ſhould ſeek their welfare in another Country, it were enough to turne the heart of all the Nation againſt them: this is the way of all Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, they cry down the glory of the world; the pleaſures of the world, the riches of the world, the honour and pompe of the world, they cry all down as a baſe thing, and they profeſle, to lay up all their treaſure elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, and therefore the world cannot beare it: then add in the laſt place,</p>
            <p>That all that is excellent in the Church, is inviſible and undiſcernible by a carn all eye; they have in them <note place="margin">3.</note> many things that will challenge reſpect and reverence, but they are not ſeen; all the outſide is poore, and baſe, and mean, and contemptible, unattended, unho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured; and for ſuch a poore low ſort of people to take ſo much upon them, who have no worth in them, that others can diſcern, is intolerable, no marvaile that the world bee againſt them; this made the two Witneſſes
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:161703:9"/>
ſo hated, <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. that though they were but two, and they alſo cloathed in ſackcloth, yet they durſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to throw fire in the faces of all men, who lived up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth. Upon ſuch grounds as theſe, there ever hath been in the hearts of all the enemies of the Church, an inceſſant indeavour, and an unanimous confederacy, to ruin them, and deſtroy them; I note this but for theſe two ends briefly; Firſt,</p>
            <p>That it may teach all the ſervants of Chriſt, all the people of God, what they muſt look for in this world, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. Therefore the the people of God, muſt look for no quiet in this world.</note> while their lot is to live amongſt worldly men; they muſt looke for no other, but plots, and conſpiracies, and confederacies for their ruine; and let it not bee hard, It was ſo with the Lord himſelf, <hi>Quod erat Chriſtus eri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Chriſtiani;</hi> What Chriſt was, we Chriſtians muſt bee; and it is enough, to be like our Maſter, while hee hee lived upon earth, although hee never did hurt any, walked unblamably, pitied all, helped all that came to him, yet hee was not beleeved in his word, he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached in his life, hated in his perſon, grieved in his Spirit, the whole way of the world went againſt him; and it muſt and will bee ſo with his ſervants, while there is a devill and a devilliſh ſpirit in the world, the gates of hell will bee working, in one kind or other, <hi>Non ſemper ſaeviunt Nerones, ſed nunquam ceſſat diabolus,</hi> there are not alwayes raging <hi>Neroes,</hi> but there are alwayes devils and devilliſh men, every <hi>Abel</hi> ſhall be ſure of a <hi>Cain,</hi> and the Congregation of Chriſts people muſt bee oppoſed by the aſſociation of Malignant enemies. But Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</p>
            <p>That which I would faine leave with you is this, even a uſe of wiſdome; which all the ſervants of God <note place="margin">

harmony in the ſpirits and endeavours of all the enemies of Gods people for their ruine; how ſhould this provoke al the ſervants of Chriſt to aſſociate and unite themſelves together, for their mutuall ſafetie? certainly when <hi>Gebal,</hi> and <hi>Ammon,</hi> and <hi>Amalek,</hi> and the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> and they that dwell at <hi>Tyre, Aſher,</hi> and the children of <hi>Lot,</hi> are all confederate againſt Gods people, it were a ſtarke mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for <hi>Ephraim</hi> then to bite <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> and <hi>Manaſſes</hi> to bite <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and both theſe to devoure <hi>Iudah;</hi> O how uncomely, and unſeaſonable a thing is it, to find the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God divided one from another, and helping by their jealouſies, and diviſions, the hurt and raine one of another, at that time when there is one ſoul and ſpirit, poſſeſſes all their adverſaries to deſtroy them; how ſad is it, that we cannot learne that wiſedome of our adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries? looke over all the world, and you ſhall find, that the generality of the world, are all children of <hi>Babel,</hi> children of confuſion, have ſeverall intereſts one from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, can undermine one another, can fight one againſt another, yet they all can and doe <hi>convenire in hoc tertio,</hi> they all agree in this, that when there is a buſineſſe againſt the Church of God, they will all be one againſt it: Shall not the ſervants of God joyn together for their ſafety? this duty of loving one another our Saviour preſſeth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">Epheſ. 1. 4. Iohn 13. Col. 3.</note> us by many arguments, we have one God, one Lord, one Faith, one Baptiſme, &amp;c. it was one of his laſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions, Love one another, it's the band of perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp;c. yet all will not do it, our great enemy knowes how open we lye to him, when a ſpirit of diviſion is got in; they that have read the ſtories of the Church, are able to prove it, that next to Apoſtaſie from God, the diviſions that have been found amongſt Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, have been the greateſt means of their hurt and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:161703:10"/>
God in mercy teach us now to learne our duty; ſure I am, this exhortation was never more needfull, and uſefull, then it is at this day, and unto this nation, where there are found a people, a godly people, for whom the Lord hath done admirable things, greater then which he hath not done ſince he brought <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and now after God hath done all this for us, wee are <hi>tantum non</hi> ſwallowed up, and ſhould it prove ſo, it muſt lie up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this, <hi>our diviſions have undone us,</hi> when the Lord hath prevented our enemies, wee have undermined one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and been jealous one of another, and hated one another, and that ſo bitterly that I have often with ſorrow thought, that in <hi>England</hi> this day, it is not much better, then it is in <hi>Turkie,</hi> in this reſpect; they who write of the ſtate of the Chriſtians among the <hi>Turks,</hi> ſay this of them, that their diviſions are ſuch one againſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and their hatred ſo implacable, that they love the <hi>Turke</hi> better then they love one another, and that the <hi>Turke</hi> makes uſe of them as his inſtruments, and infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers to ruine one another, and that if there were an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of the one ſide able to cope with an Army of the <hi>Turkes,</hi> he that ſhall expect to have but one good wiſh from the reſt of the Chriſtians to accompany them, would be utterly deceived; which (ſaith a learned ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver) makes their bondage irrecoverable; Alas that we ſhould be ſo neer if in <hi>England,</hi> that the diviſions that are got in amongſt the ſervants of God, ſhould make us like the Hieroglyphique of the Dragon and the Lion, figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting one againſt another, when the Griffin hangs over them to devoure them both when they have weakened &amp; wounded one another. This is our preſent ſad condition, God in mercy amend it; I have much adoe to keep off from further enlarging my complaint upon this wofull
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:161703:10"/>
theam, becauſe our diviſions (beſide all other miſchiefes which attend them,) hinder us from priſing and eſteeming deliverances and the mercies which God beſtowes upon us, as in ſuch a deliverance and mercy as we meet to praiſe God for this day; many, yea many honeſt and good men hardly know how to praiſe for it, when the inſtruments of it are men from whom we are divided in our affections, leſt poſſibly ſome ſuch reſpect ſhould be offered them as we like not: and thus God is deprived of his glory and we of our comfort. O the wofull fruits of our diſcord! Chriſt will not bear theſe things at our hands, he wil either make us one or none; I am perſwaded he will either make us lay down theſe oru diviſions, or he will give us up into their hands, who will make us agree in eating the bread of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and drinking the water of affliction, make us agree in one common calamity with a witneſſe. Pardon this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion (if it be one) which the exigence of the times and our dangers, put me upon; I urge theſe things to ſtir up your frequent prayers that God would be merciful unto us, that we might not thus pul down our houſes with our owne hands. Thus from the firſt part, the confederacy againſt the Church; the other I principally aime at, and that is,</p>
            <p>The deliverance from it: where you have conſiderable <note place="margin">Second and third part of the Text, the Churches deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance and the cauſe of it.</note> two things: Firſt,</p>
            <p>The deliverance it ſelfe; the breaking of all the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells of their enemies, and the turning of all upon their own heads: and Secondly,</p>
            <p>The cauſe of it; and that is <hi>Immanuel,</hi> he is the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of it.</p>
            <p>Now though there be but one main leſſon, that I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to handle, yet there are three or foure particulars, that I would hint and but little more then name; one is,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:161703:11"/>
that although the Lord had brought theſe <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his people, and delivered his people into their hands, yet their rage, and cruelty, and fury againſt his Church did move God to turn his hand upon them, though he had imployed them to afflict, and chaſtiſe his people:</p>
            <p>That the more rage and fury is in the enemies of the Church, the ſooner doth the Lord compaſſionate the <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 3. The rage and fury of the Churches ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies haſten the Churches deliverance. Deut. 32.</note> miſeries of his Church; there are very many examples of it, in the 32. <hi>Deuter. I ſaid I would ſcatter them,</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the rebellions of his people, which had anger'd him; I ſaid (ſaith he) <hi>I would even ſcatter them into corners, I would make the remembrance of them to ceaſe from among men, were it not that I feare the furie of their enemy,</hi> that he would exalt himſelfe too much againſt them: <hi>Senacherib</hi> is a famous inſtance of this, <hi>Eſay</hi> 10. God had ſtirred him up to goe againſt his people, to take the ſpoil of them, and to tread them downe as the mire in the ſtreets: but <hi>Senacheribs</hi> rage grew higher, he would deſtroy and utterly cut them off, he would do to <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> as he had done to <hi>Samaria,</hi> but even therefore did God compaſſionate his people, and ruine this proud adverſary: ſo likewiſe, <hi>Zach.</hi> 1. 14, 15, 16. &amp;c. <hi>God was a little angry and diſpleaſed with his people, and the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies helped forward the affliction,</hi> but <hi>therefore was God ſore diſpleaſed with their enemies, and even therefore did he returne to</hi> Hieruſalem <hi>with mercyes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you ſee God compaſſionates the miſery of his people, the more the rage and furie of the adverſary is <note place="margin">Application.</note> kindlled againſt them: And therefore (to apply this in a word or two) that which is to many in theſe dayes, is a wonderfull diſcouragement of heart, I thinke rather ſhould to be a ground of hope to us; I mean the extream rage and fury which appears in the ſpirits of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:161703:11"/>
moſt wicked men againſt ſuch as fear God; I believe there was never ſo much bloud, nor wrath, rage, nor fury, in the hearts of the enemies of Gods people as is this day to be found; they feare not to ſpeake it out, that not a man of them ſhall live in the Kingdome, when once power comes into their hands; they hope the day is comming, and they make account to doe, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſaid he would do, when he followed the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> into <note place="margin">Exod. 15. 9.</note> the Red ſea, I will now overtake them, my <hi>wrath ſhall be now ſatisfied to the full upon them;</hi> now who knowes but the Lord will doe his people the more good for this; as <hi>David</hi> ſaid of <hi>Shimei,</hi> when he curſed him, and they would have had him take off his head, No (ſaith he) <hi>let him curſe, it may be God will doe me good for his cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of me;</hi> the more pride, and wrath there is in the hearts of thoſe, that thinke to tread his people down, the more will God lay their inſolency to his heart.</p>
            <p>Again, you may obſerve here, with what ſcorne and <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 2. With what ſcorn and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, God looks upon the preparations and forces of his Churches e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enemies.</note> contempt the Lord doth ſpeake of all the preparations of man againſt his people; here was a mighty Army liſted and rallied, gathered together, met at their rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouz, yea, come into the Kingdome, and made account to carry all before them, but how diſdainfully the Lord ſpeakes of all their preparations; Aſſociate your ſelves, goe your wayes on, you thinke to doe a great act, you make account to carry all, but it will not doe, it will not ſtand; poore peoplel you reckon without your hoſt; thus the Lord (as the prophet ſaith) ſits in heaven, and laughs <note place="margin">Pſ. 22.</note> at them; he ſcorns all their preparations, that they make againſt his ſervants: and truly the naming of it, ſhould teach us to make the ſame uſe of it, that <hi>Luther</hi> did, <note place="margin">Application.</note> Surely (ſaith he) if Jeſus Chriſt ſit in heaven and laugh at them, we ſhould be fooliſh on earth, to ſit and cry for
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:161703:12"/>
feare of them; for Chriſt well enough knowes what they can doe, and what they ſhall doe, let us never trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at that which Ieſus Chriſt laughes at. Obſerve fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</p>
            <p>That when the Lord doth think upon deliverance for his afflicted people, it is nothing of their worth, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 3.</note> the intereſt of <hi>Immanuel,</hi> which prevailes with God; here the Lord had ſtirred up an enemy to come againſt them, and they came, and when they thought to doe great matters, the Lord would not let them, but would turne all upon their owne heads; and why? <hi>for Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel, Immanuel is intereſſed in it,</hi> not the worthineſſe of Gods people, as he often ſaith it; be it knowne to you, <hi>I doe nothing of all this for your ſakes, be you aſhamed and confounded, it is for my own names ſake which I work for;</hi> I regard the glory of my Son, Chriſts intereſt will bring deliverance, when the unworthines of the Church would rather call for vengeance. 'Tis true, God dearly loves his people, they are to him as the apple of his eye, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and nations are nothing to him in compariſon of his people, but 'tis no worth in them, nothing of their owne, which commends them to him, they often lye in their blood which yet is a time of love to him, and ſhould he forbeare healing and helping till their worthineſſe cal'd for deliverance it would, never come, 'tis that love wherewith he hath loved them in <hi>Immanuel,</hi> which <note place="margin">Application.</note> brings all; therefore though we ſhould be humbled and even tremble at the thought of our preſent unworthines, yet ſhould Gods people comfortably hope and wait, that for Chriſts intereſt in our preſent cauſe and worke, deliverance will come.</p>
            <p>Before I come to the chiefe leſſon, point at one more,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:161703:12"/>
That when the greateſt inundations of miſeries doe flow in upon the Church, yet the Lord ſets bounds to them, that they cannot go ſo far as the enemy would: here the waters ſhould come up to the chin, but yet not over head and eares; the Lord often afflicts his people, but he will not give them up to a totall ſpoile, and deſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; all theſe things deſerve to be handled more fully, but the time will not allow it; I come now therefore to that onely leſſon, that I intend more full to inſiſt upon; and that is this,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Immanuel, our bleſſed Saviour, doth turne all the plots</hi>

            <p>That all the aſſociations, and plots that are againſt Gods people, Jeſus Chriſt doth ſo order the matter, that <note place="margin">Ieſus Chriſt turns the moſt deſperate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes of his Churches ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies upon their own heads, &amp;c.</note> in the reſult and event, they ſhall be all turned upon the heads of the adverſaries; and for the welfare of thoſe that are his ſervants: there is no one argument in the whole booke of God more frequently repeated in vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous inſtances, then this doctrin which I have propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: that of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> of <hi>Siſera,</hi> of <hi>Senacherib,</hi> of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> of the conſpiracie againſt Chriſt; and a hundred others more, ſome relating to the Church in generall, ſome relating to particular godly men, in all of them the Lord hath ever made it good, that the miſchief intended <note place="margin">This cleared by five conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions gathered out of the text.</note> againſt his people, turns upon the heads of the contrivers.

               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Concluſion.</hi> 1. Chriſt hath a hand in contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving every plot that is againſt the Church.</note> 
               <hi>Lord bringeth upon them the King of</hi> Aſſyria: the Lord had determined how far he ſhould goe, how hee ſhould ſpread over all the land, <hi>and his waters ſhould reach up to the neck:</hi> in the next Chapter but one, in the 10 <hi>Iſa.</hi> God ſaith of him, <hi>I ſent him againſt them, though he did not thinke ſo:</hi> So alſo in the 4. of <hi>Micah, Many nations are gathered together againſt thee, &amp;c.</hi> but it followes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, <hi>I gather them as ſheaves;</hi> ſo in the famous caſe of the death of Chriſt, <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> with the <note place="margin">Acts 4 26, 27, 28.</note> 
               <hi>Gentiles</hi> and the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were gathered together againſt the Lord and againſt his Chriſt, but it was to do what Gods hand and counſell had before determined to be done. Secondly,</p>
            <p>In this contrivement, Jeſus Chriſt intendeth one thing, <note place="margin">2.</note> and the enemies intend another thing, each of them <note place="margin">Chriſt intends one thing, the enemy another thing.</note> working according to their owne principles; that you have plain here, the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> comes in, his intent is to ſwallow up all, the Lords intent is, that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and all his company ſhal be broken to pieces; thus <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephs</hi> brethren thought evill againſt him, but God meant good to him; thus <hi>Pharaoh</hi> intended the extirpation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> by that which God intended their propagation; <note place="margin">Gen. 50. 20. Exod. 1. 12. Heſter 3. 1. Micah 4. 12, 13.</note> thus <hi>Haman</hi> intended the ruine of <hi>Mordecai</hi> and all the <hi>Iewes,</hi> when God intended light and gladneſſe and a good day to them; thus the nations <hi>Micah</hi> 4. intended to tread down <hi>Zion,</hi> when God intended they themſelves ſhould be threſhed out: and a hundred examples more might be given, but I can only point at theſe things. Thirdly,</p>
            <p>That Jeſus Chriſt doth very frequently let the deſigns <note place="margin">3.</note> of the adverſaries of his Church goe on, with a great <note place="margin">Chriſt often lets them goe on till they think to attain their end.</note> deale of ſucceſſe and proſperity, untill they think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:161703:14"/>
cock-ſure of the whole buſineſſe: this you may ſee in the Text here, they came with ſuch a mighty Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, that they made no queſtion of carrying all before them, made account all was their own; thus <hi>Pharaoh</hi> went <note place="margin">Exod. 15. 9. Heſter. 10. 8, 9.</note> on till he was confident his wrath ſhould be ſatisfied up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15. So <hi>Haman</hi> had got his decrees ſigned by the Kings letters, which by the law of <hi>Perſia</hi> was irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocable; thus was <hi>Peter</hi> kept in priſon untill the very <note place="margin">Acts 12. 7.</note> night before he ſhould be executed: and ſo in abundance of other deſigns againſt the Church you may ſee the like, though it is very true that ſometimes the Lord cruſhes them in the egge, and will not let them break out into Serpents; yet very often (as we ſay in the Gunpowder-treaſon) there wanted nothing, but to put the match to the powder, and the blow had been given; ſo God lets the plots and contrivements of the enemies of his Church, go on, untill they make account that there be no way in the world to ſtop them, or to prevent them; ſo that if Gods people be delivered, <hi>their ſoules muſt eſcape as a bird out of the ſnare of the Fowler.</hi> The next conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is,</p>
            <p>That when the enemies make account all is ſure, that <note place="margin">4.</note> they queſtion not, but the day is their owne, then doth <note place="margin">Chriſt defeats them when they thinke themſelves moſt ſure. Acts 20. 12 &amp;c.</note> the Lord in ſome unexpected way, daſh all their plots, bring them to nothing; thus God defeated <hi>Pharaoh, Exod.</hi> 15. thus was <hi>Haman</hi> defeated, thus was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy againſt <hi>Paul</hi> defeated, <hi>Acts.</hi> 26. a hundred inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces might be given, but I ſhall only open one ſimilitude which God uſe to ſet down the manner of the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Nineveh, Nahum</hi> 1. 10. <hi>Nineveh</hi> was then the head of this <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Empire, and God expreſſeth the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of <hi>Nineveh</hi> thus, <hi>when they are folden together, like thornes, and when they are drunken like drunkards, then
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:161703:15"/>
ſhall they be devoured as ſtubble fully dryed;</hi> that is, when their plots are curiouſly weaved, and ſet ſo, that no man ſhall dare to touch them, no more then he would touch a wreath of thornes; they have ſo contrived the buſineſſe that they would faine ſee the man that durſt appeare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them; <hi>They are folded together as thornes, and when they are drunken like drunkards,</hi> that is, they are drunken with pride and confidence of their ſucceſſe, they can hardly ſpeak or goe, they are ſo drunken with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, when they are come thus to the top, <hi>then ſhall they be devoured like dry ſtuble,</hi> ſome way or other fire will be put to the thatch of the houſe, and ſet it a burning, and in a moment all is gone off. Thus <hi>when the enemy is come in like a floud, the ſpirit of the Lord lifts up a ſtandard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him.</hi> Thus God delights to take his time, when <note place="margin">Eſa <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

            <p>That when God breaks their deſignes, hee delights to <note place="margin">5.</note> break themſelves, not onely to fruſtrate their deſignes, <note place="margin">When Chriſt breaks his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies plots, he often breaks themſelves alſo.</note> but to ruine them too, and deliver his people; ſo it is here, <hi>Aſsociate your ſelves, gather your ſelves, gird your ſelves, take counſell, but ſtill you ſhall be broken to pieces, ye ſhall be broken to pieces, ye ſhall be broken to pieces,</hi> three times it is in one verſe; all breaking to pieces, ruin and deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to them, and ſalvation, and deliverance to Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: Thus was it to <hi>Pharoah</hi> and his hoaſt, thus was it <note place="margin">Exod. 1. 4.

            </p>
            <p>Sometimes the Lord doth infatuate their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, that they goe a ſimple way to worke in a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <note place="margin">2.</note> that elſe might bee carried eaſily, <hi>Eſay</hi> 19. <note place="margin">Eſa 19 20, 12.</note> 20, 12.</p>

            <p>Sometimes the Lord ſtrikes into them a ſpirit of <note place="margin">4.</note> terror, and amazement, that they doe not know whence <note place="margin">Eſay 13. 8.</note> it is, nor why it is, and yet their courage is wholly gone, and ſo God threatned it ſhould be both to <hi>Niniveh</hi> and <hi>Babylon, Eſay</hi> 13.</p>

of this wiſe man?

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:161703:18"/>
thus it appeares to mee when I look upon theſe things, with carnall eyes: I can then ſee no way, but the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulleſt confuſion breaking in upon us, which a Kingdom can be plunged in, eſpecially that the godly party are even like to be given up for a ſpoile, and a prey; all our foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations are out of joynt, and our whole houſe ſeemes falling; but what then? Muſt we therefore ſit downe, and deſpaire? No, for <hi>Immanuel,</hi> becauſe of <hi>Immanuel</hi> wee may beare up our hearts ſtill; and to encourage you, I pray you carry home, theſe foure or five medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: Firſt,</p>
            <p>Know you for certain, that there is not one of all theſe buſineſſes, not any of theſe deſignes and plots that are in <note place="margin">1.</note> hand againſt us, but the beſt friend wee have in heaven and earth, hath ſtirred them all; no man could offer at you, ſo much as a drawne Dagger, if Jeſus Chriſt did not draw it, and put it into his hand: and truly Gods people need not feare any great hurt from any deſigne that Jeſus Chriſt hath his hand in; the clouds which Jeſus Chriſt raiſeth will all drop fatneſſe, that is one, Chriſt hath contrived them all, and you may therefore look for good from them; Secondly,</p>
            <p>Know for certaine that in the greateſt rage and fury that ever is found amongſt wicked men, <hi>Immanuel</hi> hath <note place="margin">2.</note> a negative voice; hee is not onely privy to all the counſels that are, but he hath a negative voice in them too: If hee ſay <hi>nay,</hi> all their yeas are: not worth a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, to advance their buſineſſe; wee uſe to ſay to the Papiſts, that if a generall councel could be called in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrendome, no good could bee expected from it, if the Pope bee allowed to have a negative voyce, for certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hee will never paſſe any thing that ſhall be againſt the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> Jeſus Chriſt hath this negative
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:161703:18"/>
voice; you may demand over whom hath Chriſt a negative voice? I tel you,</p>
            <p>Over the Sun; hee <hi>ſaith to the Sun, doe not ſhine;</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1.</note> though the Sun be prepared as a Gyant to run his race, if <note place="margin">Iob 7.</note> Chriſt doe but ſay, doe not ſhine, the Sun puts his head in a cloud. <note place="margin">2.</note>
            </p>
            <p>He hath a negative voice over the Seas; if he ſay to the Seas, goe not there, the raging waves of the Sea cannot ſtir; it is an obſervation that <hi>Baſil</hi> hath upon <hi>Egypt,</hi> that the land of <hi>Egypt</hi> lies lower then the red Sea, that the red Sea, is higher then the land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſo that there is no reaſon can be given why the red Sea doth not drown all <hi>Egypt</hi> and ſwallow it up, every day, but onely the Lord doth not give his voyce to it; he hath ſaid to the waves of it, <hi>Hitherto ye ſhall come, and here yee ſhall turne back</hi> up on a levell ground; yea runne away from a lower ground, and when the waves roare, he but ſaith, <hi>peace, bee ſtill,</hi> and huſheth them as a child.</p>
            <p>Chriſt hath a negative voice over the Devill; If <note place="margin">3.</note> the Devill would but goe into a hog, and Chriſt ſay, no, you ſhall not goe, he cannot enter into a Swine.</p>
            <p>Hee hath a negative voyce over all mortall men; in <note place="margin">4.</note> all their plots and conſpiracies; If hee ſay, it ſhall not ſtand, it is to no purpoſe: certainly Beloved, wee may beare up our hearts comfortably upon ſuch grounds as theſe; yea, Thirdly, as Chriſt contrives all, and hath a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative voice in all; ſo,</p>
            <p>All theſe doe but work his work: hee is not onely <note place="margin">3.</note> one of them, but they are all his Agents too; hee hath ſome worke to doe, whatever it bee wherein hee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys them, and though hee let them worke according to their principles, yet they all worke the work of the Lord, the devills in hell worke the worke of Chriſt, as
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:161703:19"/>
well as the Angels in heaven; the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> works the worke of Chriſt, as well as a faithfull Miniſter in a Pulpit doth; I mean not that they doe it from right principles, or doe it according to rule, but <hi>de facto,</hi> they doe nothing but what Chriſt will have done, as the <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> did <hi>in crucifying Chriſt,</hi> when they hung him upon the croſſe, they did nothing, but what the Lords counſell had determined to bee done before <note place="margin">Acts 4. 28.</note> the foundations of the World were laid; Nay I adde in the laſt place, to ſtrengthen you, that as they work all of them the Lords work; So</p>
            <p>The Lords work &amp; deſign is, <hi>the good of his Church,</hi> the calling, the purging, the preſerving, the building, and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing, <note place="margin">4.</note> and growth of the Church, is all the work that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt hath to doe, when that is done, the world ends, and he reſignes up the Kingdome into his Fathers hand; now certainly if we can beleeve all theſe things, may not our hearts reſt quiet? May not wee (if wee be ingaged in a good cauſe, may not wee I ſay) with comfort and confidence, put it into the Lords hand, and let him doe what hee will? I am perſwaded the ground of all the diffidence and diſcouragement that is found amongſt the people of God this day, ariſes from their ignorance of the intereſt of Jeſus Chriſt in theſe publick affaires, and I know alſo that to thoſe men that are but Politicians, and carry carnall and worldly deſignes of their own, ſuch a leſſon as this can be of no uſe, nor ſtay to them, for Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is againſt them; but for thoſe that have a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall eye, and would bee glad to have ſome prop to lean upon, this may ſtay and quiet their hearts; they may comfortably ſet down this concluſion, their Adverſary may have great power and ſtrength, but the Church hath <hi>Immanuel;</hi> they have the wealth of the World,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:161703:19"/>
the Church hath the wealth of <hi>Immanuel,</hi> the wiſdome, care and goodneſſe of <hi>Immanuel;</hi> they have the whole world to joyn with them, but we have Jeſus Chriſt with us, and that's more; <hi>non eſt conſilium contra Dominum;</hi> there is no counſell, nor ſtrength againſt the Lord: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſtay, and quiet your hearts with theſe things, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially this might ſtay us againſt our feares of having this tender plant of Reformation blaſted and ſpoiled by the many enemies who oppoſe it, it hath been Chriſts ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary way to let his enemies ſet againſt his worke, when its but a tender plant, when in all likelihood it may bee moſt eaſily ſpoil'd, and he orders it ſo purpoſely to make men ſee and know that when they have vented their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt rage, and done their worſt, hee will carry it on in deſpight of them. I conclude this uſe in the Prophets words in this place, Sanctifie the Lord in your hearts, fear not mens feare, looke to Chriſt, even though hee hide his face, one word ſpoken by him, can and will in due time quiet all theſe ſtormy waves: and then Thirdly, with which I will end, This leſſon is applyed here by the Prophet likewiſe,</p>
