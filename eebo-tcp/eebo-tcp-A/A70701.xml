            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:51440:3"/>
more certainly may hee want this ayde, which wandereth through uncertaine passages, and walketh through the unknown wayes of an unstable conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And since (as it seemeth to mee) that man hath good, and propitious lucke, which in his doubtfull extremities may have the opportunity to flye unto wholsome and grave counsels: there can nothing be more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily assigned unto an ingenuous, and well educated nature, then some path or learned directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which may be rather signed with the lively pourtraicture of eloquence, then with lime or chalke-stone. This noble facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
<pb facs="tcp:51440:3"/>
I must confesse, I cannot boast, because it is both unseem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for a teacher of naked truth, to use the adulterate flourishes. of Rhetorique, and also, because it is so meanly apparant in mee, that it will presently decay, if it should bee brought before, the judicious lights of these times: only my chiefe ayme is in this Treatise, to shew and breath forth the ingenuous candour of my minde; and my brotherly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection towards you; if those rules, which in the following subject bee proposed, may by
<pb facs="tcp:51440:4"/>
you bee received with the like kind inclination. There are some (I perswade my selfe) of a light and brain-sick condition, which (being also not few in number) desire to borrow no directions from the store-house of learned Philosophie: and so much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne the rules of contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the demonstrations which are deduced from our solitary thoughts, that they sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose these Canons, but meere ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous, and crasie fansies, and the vaine blasts of swelling Ayre. But how much you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne
<pb facs="tcp:51440:4"/>
the sottish opinion of these men, and dislike of this most pernitious tenet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all vertuous proceedings I am very well acquainted: having in your childish yeares, heard your labotious Essayes, most elegantly for that age em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, in the praises and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations of contemplative men; for there is no man without all question, which desireth (with <hi>Ennius)</hi> to live the life of a reasonable creature, but doth cordially admire learning, and desireth to salute those
<pb facs="tcp:51440:5"/>
sweet flowers of Science, from whose fragrant beds, sundry ohoyce compositions of elocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth arise, whereby ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary things, may bee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood with delight, and obscure things may bee made easie by industrie.

Those things therefore (dearely <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>steemed brother) which I deduce from this Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazine, and in the subsequent Tract, doe propose unto you; I entreat you not to undervalew, untill the second consideration, the third reading over, and the fourefold more acurate know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge (then yet your yeares are capable of) of humane subtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and affaires, may convict men in these present directions, an importunate affecter of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling observations, or a bringer forth of such productions, which

Neither can I conceive, that you spend your pretious time amisse, when you cast your eyes, and your most serious faculties upon learned discourses, as though that these were but employments for idle times, and hinderances to affaires of consequence; thinking it a childish practise, (as many doe,) to meditate, or write out any learned Contemplation. Beleeve me, those follies which they that affect this lazinesse, commit, are

meere frivolous ravings, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes, not valuable in the right scale of reason, to turne downe the weight of a crackt nut-shell.

               <hi>momenta, non margines, aut super fines introspiciunt:</hi> But few or none, which have prescribed the exact and profitable limits, which ought to direct this laudable purpose. And therefore I have observed it to be a custome (perhaps, where it is well sorted, not unprofitable) among those which send forth their sons, pupils, or kinsemen to travell, to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect some discreet, and well experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enc't Companion, which may more safely waft them to their owne homes backe againe, through many tempests, that continually use to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault those which Iourny from their homes. But these doe not alwayes ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill the intentions of the Directors, or rather imployers; because fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently

most men belye or overweene their own sufficiencie: and (which is worse) usually overshadow, by their cunning demeanour, at or before their election, their owne<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> vices.</p>
            <p>I have therefore thought it, in my opinion, alwaies a profitable worke; if any (which bath ability for directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this quality) studious, and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber man, would, collect, to necessary and pertinent heades, such monitions cautions, and observations, which might be easily found out: whereby the hot spirits of some novices may be wholesomely restrained and faithfully instructed. For these dumbe counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, are commonly most trusty, and carry with them in their prudent di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, collected from both reading
<pb facs="tcp:51440:9"/>
and experience more solid profit: then those which eyther readily spend their Iudgements without meditation, or at leastwise have no other but transitory and superficiall knowledge. Finding therefore none that hath in our vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar language (to my remembrance) undertaken this profitable essay; I have adventured to make publique a small treatise of direction how to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell profitably, and safely into for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Countries; which in another i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diome I had some 4 yeares since ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed, to a neere and deere travellor of my acquaintance.

without the censure of the criticall, and with the allowance of the Courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous reader.

            <head>A Treatise of direction; how to travaile profitably, and safely into forraigne Countries.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow therefore, that we may methodically signe those precepts, which in the epistle we have generally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, it will not be impertinent to bring before the reader, their logicall distribution: and first that we may profitably bend our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, let us behold the end, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which, your resolution and my speech ought to be referred. <hi>The end therefore of discreet Travaile, is Wisedome:</hi> which undertaken
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51440:12"/>
with a fortunate preparation, is circumscribed with two bounds, to wit, men travaile for experience sake, and the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the bodies faculties; or, for to better the gifts of the mind. The first cause of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, and bettering the inward parts, carried <hi>Plato</hi> into <hi>AEgypt, Pythagoras</hi> into those regions of <hi>Italy,</hi> which were then called, the greater <hi>Graecia,</hi> and ushered <hi>Apollonius</hi> (that I may use the words of <hi>Hierom)</hi> unto the scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched desarts of <hi>India,</hi> and the secret conclave of the Sunne. The latter moved those great warriors (if wee allow not the desire, of renowne to bee the only cause) <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:51440:12"/>
to take farre Iourneyes, that they might not only in words, but in verity prove themselves as well hardy, as va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant.</p>
            <p>Therefore that great <hi>Macedonian</hi> monarch, when hee observed a Common Souldier frozen al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most to death by passing through those mountainous Counties; descending from his throne, or chaire of state, placed the halfe dead souldier therein, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter those delicacies of ambition, which hee bought by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours of the common soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, hee might obtaine the fame of a compassionate and hardy man. So often <hi>Iulius Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar,</hi> that true, and legitimate
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51440:13"/>
son of <hi>Mars,</hi> as wel in his descent, as actions, was wont to take, not only the same diet, and lodging with the meanest of his souldiers: but some times upon especiall oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, he was used to prevent the marches, and with incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble celerity to passe one hundred miles within the compasse of one day. Rightly did these famous chief<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>aines understand that true, and ancient sentence of the poet <hi>Timocles</hi> in <hi>Atbenaeus:</hi> 1. 6.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Each noble soule most labours takes, for why?</l>
               <l>His honours issue from his Industrie.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Heated with this Imagination, did <hi>Alexander</hi> after the laborious siege of the City <hi>Oxidrace,</hi> leapt in a most ardent sweat, into the river
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51440:13"/>
               <hi>Cephysus:</hi> that by enduring at the same time the heat of the south, and the cold of the north, he might shew the strong composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his body, and the Invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble tolerance of his mind. But much more was the wonderfull tolerance of the Phylosophers, as though there had among them beene this only strife, which should be able to endure most. For <hi>Zeno</hi> the master or beginner of the stoick sect, when he might have lived safe in his owne Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, travelled out of desire of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing his knowledge, and shewing his constancy, into <hi>Sicilie,</hi> to the City of <hi>Phalaris</hi> that most inhumane Tyrant, named <hi>Agrigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> being so confident of his
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51440:14"/>
Towne abilities in enduring, saith <hi>Valerius l. 3.</hi> that by his precepts, the barbarous ferity of the people, and cruell savage in humanity of the Tyrant himselfe might be mollifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. A Philosopher also of the same name being entertained by <hi>Near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> likewise a most fierce Tyrant, and after some conspiracy against him being taken and also freed from the tortures of the rack upon hope of some farther Confession, approching neere unto that mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of men, he so strongely fastned with his teeth upon the eare of the Tyrant, that he bit his eare from his head; neither left his hold un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til his bowels were plucked forth. Strange are the examples of <hi>Anax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archus, Theodorus, Caelanus</hi> the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51440:14"/>
&amp; of other Gymnosophists, which we read of their tollerance in this, and other authors: al which to adde unto this Topique will be both tedious, and unnecessary. And certainely this is most plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Confessed, by al that read the examples of histories, that men which have beene Inclined to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile have nothing so much desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as glory, and credit, amongst those forraigne nations where they have beene entertained, which some have endeavoured to obtaine by the vigour of the minde, and the faculties of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, shining with the sparkes of vertues and learning: others have laboured to get by the vastnesse, strength, patience, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:51440:15"/>
agility of their bodies. But this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stentation of bodily strength is more sordid, then the other, which is most ingeniously decyphered by the witty Poet <hi>Martiall.</hi>

            <p>As it were exemplarily treading out the pathes of the most grave Philosophers, and Travaling to learne experience, and teach pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Not as many braine-sicke Travellours doe in these times; which live from day to day, as the proverbe is; and being overheated by a furious brain, doe skip infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Countries, without me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod or discretion, from one place to another: or inflamed with an incessant desire of dancing up and downe, practise nothing else, but to advance their unruly and head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long passions. These a considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51440:16"/>
of their universall emptinesse both in braine and purse (any wise and prudent man would suppose) if they had but one Dramme of discretion, would send backe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though with loss into their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. Infinite numbers of which summer Birds, that are onely like swallowes or Cuckowes, good for the sack and smoke in the chimnies, doe so overheate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with hot exotique wines and fruits, perpetually gowstering on the <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Italian</hi> delicates, that scarce one of 10 returneth home alive. How many at the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault of the <hi>Groine</hi> and <hi>Lisbone,</hi> when <hi>Don Antonio</hi> the base would have recovered <hi>Portugal,</hi> were sent unto their latest homes in a
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51440:17"/>
forraigne soile by heedlesse devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of out-landish foode; here numbers dyed (as one speaketh) and distempers were Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours over the English Victors. The same fortune run many of our young lusty merchants and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners <hi>In Iava,</hi> at <hi>Bantam;</hi> at the <hi>Moluccaes, Amboina, Banda,</hi> the gulfe of <hi>Bengala, Coromandel, Pegu, Tenussery, Mocasser, Achen, Sumatra, Zeilan,</hi> and finally in all those hot Countries of <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Iapon;</hi> which doe overthrow your health with the hot fruits of those Countries, and by excessive drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of a strong wine, Called <hi>Arecca,</hi> Common throughout all the east, and with the contagious women, and almost as Contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:51440:17"/>
heat of the Country. And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny (if not to many) are those, which wearied with the delights of their owne Country, see <hi>Italy, Spaine, France,</hi> upon as hard con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions: which besides the Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience of French affronts, and <hi>Rodomantodo</hi> duels, spanish Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions, and Italian suspitions (with <hi>Naples</hi> buttons sometimes to boot) run them into many irrecoverable hazards. Pity it is (saith a discreet Travellour) that the parents, tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours; guardians, and friends will permit, much lesse egge on rash in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerate hot headed spirits, and vaine glorious brain-sick youths; whose only studies at home hath beene their cup, pipe and some butterfly Vanities, from the frying<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan

into the fire; from Domesticall into forraign madnesse; as though the change of Ayre for a feav'rish body &amp; an ill temperd mind, were to be preferred neere the seaside, when as <hi>Horace</hi> rightly sayeth,</p>
            <q>
               <l>Those which beyond the sea doe run</l>
               <l>Ill taught, the climate only change</l>
               <l>But not their minds, now quite undone</l>
               <l>Since they were suffred thus to rage.</l>
            </q>
            <p>For if the most Crafty <hi>Vlisses</hi> himself could scarce after Innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable hazards, and losse of his companions, see the smoke fume out his owne palace in <hi>Ithaca,</hi> and was knowne by none of his friends, except by one old mastiffe (which it seem'd liv'd longer then curres doe now a daies) what shall wee think of their unhappy cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:51440:18"/>
which having neither wit, age, nor experience; ruine all their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony at home, and cannot spare, when they most abound? Certainely such brainsick skippers (as <hi>Lipsius</hi> speaketh) are like to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne more fooles then they went forth. For such endeavour not to make better their minds faculties; but only desire to jette up and downe, that they may know the length of the waies, and the names of the cities. There ought therfore to be limits, and bounds set before these travellers, or rather Skippers, that may opportunely keepe them in the path way of discretion.</p>
            <p>The first limit therefore ought to be, the Consideration of our purpose; and to what end (as the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:51440:19"/>
Poet speaketh, we are ordained, what the order of things is, what Course of life wil befit us; what may be the vocation of our neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity and Inclination.</p>
            <p>Also whether it bee convenient for our naturall addictions, the health of our bodies, the profit of our affaires, and the manner of our Conversation to travell. Then it is necessary to observe into what kind of regions, and sorts of men we are to passe: as also what things are necessary for such a resolution: and in all these circumstances we must take great care least we bee deceaved. That which followes is that we must have a regard of welsetling those things we leave behind us, and not (as some doe)
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:51440:19"/>
ought wee to thinke, that our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states will follow us from one land unto another. There must be some certaine end (as <hi>Persius</hi> saith) unto which wee must direct our actions, and a certaine marke or scope to be aimed at, must alwaies be before us. The longest day hath a night following, which Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth although slowly, yet at length it arriveth by degrees. The long Iourney too hath an end, and brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theth into a fainting period it being the generall aime of all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet Travellours, there to dy, where they have beene borne, to end their lives in their native soile although, as the Ancient Poet hath it.</p>
            <q>
               <l>
                  <hi>To</hi> heaven still, we find an equall way</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:51440:20"/>
Whither at home, or else abroad we stay.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Yet (as <hi>Tully</hi> speaketh) our Country hath in it a certaine inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing sweetnesse, and delight, that young men oftentimes doe affect the very beames of those houses in which they were borne. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let every discreet Travellour, build or settle some mansion in his owne Country, if he be able; that he may be the more gratefully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaved at his returne: otherwise he is rather an exile then a Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, neither travelleth such an one that he may come home more sufficient, and better instructed: but if he repasse by chance, that he may appeare more desperate, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy. Or oftentimes it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:51440:20"/>
that he which contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, and Slighteth his Country, is slighted also by his Country. Therefore let each Travellour set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle his affaires, as well, as he may, before his departure. For in his owne Country and family each wise man doth use first to begin Vniformity.</p>
            <p>These things being warily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, it is necessary to purge the mind from the dreggs of ill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and violent passions: and first of those innate bitternesses, which with their fharpenesse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect each thing we taste: next those impolished crudities, which may disgust forraigne nations. For every severall clymate hath amongst the ruder sort of Inhabitants some hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:51440:21"/>
and whimsies predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; which carry with them a distast being Iudged by the palate of a stranger. so the French are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted vnconstant and rash; the Spaniards proud, and vaineglori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; the Italian suspitious and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengefull; the Germans, blockish and heavy; the Sicylians, Luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and effeminate; the Polonian, barbarous and insolent; the Russe, Cruell, and yet parasiticall; the Hungarian, furious and distasteful. Generally also the Europeans are dreadlesse and rash, the Asians slothfull and effeminate; the Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can subtile and mercilesse; the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican savage and heathenish. Our extravagant humours there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when we Travell are to be
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:51440:21"/>
polished with the rasor of a mild and well qualified temper, that a man may Converse with forreig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, without shame to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treymen, or offence to strangers. For nothing, in my opinion is more dangerous, and madde then for a Travellour in strange regions to commit those things, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not fitted to the civility and custome of the places, he conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth in, may call into question the genius of his Country, and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of his owne discretion; so that if any sudden affront or mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance happen, he may seeme to beare it deservedly, whilst his owne ill carriage may be made the occasion of his unhappy successe.</p>
            <p>It is therefore a very necessary
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:51440:22"/>
and considerable worke for all discreet Travellours to cleare themselves of the burthen of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary passions before they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from home. For it is a very difficult matter to polish ones edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in that place, where all the faculties of nature are so put out of order, that scarcely our best endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours can free our selves from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hazards, and inconveniences. For aptly doth agree to many, which neglect this rule, that say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Poet <hi>Horace:</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <l>They change of totimes the clime</l>
               <l>not manners, which doe passe</l>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Their Country shoaresâ€”</hi>Yea often (as <hi>Seneca</hi> hath it) passions, the frai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leties and Infirmities of humane nature do most frequently follow
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51440:22"/>
those wanderers, which depart from their Country out of a vaine wearinesse or Curiosity: whilest those sincere abilities which they possessed at home are infected with Exotique contagions. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are those passions eased or cured by time, which are rather increased by practising. Trifles. And in another place the same learned and judicious Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher: Thou art about to change thy Country: but observe, if by avoiding that, thou canst avoide thy selfe; and not rather contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwise; thou bearest not about thee, the aggravation of thy mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous passions.</p>
            <p>As those which are sicke of a feaver unquietly tosse, and tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:51440:23"/>
themselves about, vainely hoping for ease: so many times doe those, which being sicke and diseased in their minds change climates, desiring to remedy their ungoverned affections. For this is the way rather to uncover, then to take away the disease: to confesse &amp; betray this inward heare, and not to heale it. Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly saith the Roman wise man: It is the property of a sick man to endure nothing long, but rather to use changes as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies. Hence are those wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring peregrinations undertaken, and many shoares passed over, and sometimes by land, other times by sea, over-wearied in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constancy contemning her plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:51440:23"/>
abode, is imployed. Such therefore doe rather fly away from, then avoide troubles, as that hart in <hi>Virgill.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <l>Whom 'mongst the Cressian Forrests with a dart</l>
               <l>The huntesman wounds: he feeling once the smart</l>
               <l>Flies swist away, &amp; to the woods is gone,</l>
               <l>The Cretan woods, and now forgets his home.</l>
            </q>
            <p>But yet this flight is but to little purpose, because as the same Poet addes.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Vnto his side doth sticke</l>
               <l>The barbed dart, which first his ribbs did prick.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Therefore before a discreet travellour doth undertake any Iourney or Peregrination, he
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:51440:24"/>
ought to reduce his passions to to the rule of Tranquillity; that so he may walke in the pathes of reason, and felicity. Let his Course also looke generally up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that which is vertuous: For that which in it selfe is honest, is profitable for all men: as the observation of customes, habits, rites, governments of those men and commonwealths which we see; which ought not to be negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently forgotten, or supinely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served. And therefore most wisely did those Ancients, and amongst our later travellours, some few of the most judicious, which did commit to their briefe note-books the adventures of each day: and the notable Acts of each weeke
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:51440:24"/>
to their diaries, Kalendars &amp; Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merides; from the concise maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zine of which smal library, they might (in <hi>Macrobius</hi> his sence) as from a store-house, drawne out plenty of provision, to put of the famine or barrennesse of obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion, or their confused memorials. For the Table book, and this briefe kind of writing, is the index &amp; life of memory; and may be made the Ingenions inlargement, of those things, which new matter may consu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>mate, and finish. Vpon this grasse let each laborious oxe ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate, that at length, he may be be able to tread out the pure and solid Corne of observation. And least the forme of this kind of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation may halt, in a Iudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:51440:25"/>
Travellour ought to instruct his mind with the arts (amongst which painting and limming are of best accompt) and libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall sciences, that with their aide and direction, their notes may be reduced to a methodicall order and forme. Not after the manner of some ignorant Triflers, which while they want matter, and vdnerstanding, gather toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heapes of vanities; or being blinded with faction and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice only sort but such thinges, which are pleasing to their pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and the Current of the times; utterly neglecting, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing those things, which may either rectify the error, or amend their iudgement, but how to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:51440:25"/>
support these jnjudicious wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers, the generall Topiques which follow may not unfitly be observed.</p>
            <p>Now therefore will I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to signe out limits, which may regularly direct those, which purpose to touch upon forraigne shoares. It shall be therefore ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for those which enter a strange Country, to observe these two things; with whom to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine, and in what place. For some, whilest they passe not to the chiefest and most noted places of the Countrey they now are in, but to some sordid and meant Townes, rather seeke a lurking for corner their ignorance, then a place for instruction. A stranger
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:51440:26"/>
therefore must labour and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, (if he may without any great inconvenience) to seeke the chiefe seat and head of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, wherein he resideth; neither that, in any violent hast, but by degrees: that the Iuice of his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing may draw unto it the manners of the Inferiour regions, and in a manner naturalize them, that so more safely and easily, he may arrive at the summe of his wishes. Aptly doth <hi>Tacitus</hi> teach vs this necessity in the sixth booke of his Annals Chap. 8. instancing of <hi>Phraates</hi> the Parthian, which being placed in the roome of <hi>Arta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banus</hi> by the Emperor <hi>Tiberius,</hi> whilest over suddenly he leaveth his Roman Customes, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:51440:26"/>
the guise of the <hi>Parthians,</hi> he being not able to brook so sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine a change, falleth sick and dyeth. In the same manner one <hi>Tho Randolph</hi> in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time being Embassador to <hi>Ivan Vasilonoch</hi> Emperour of <hi>Moscovia,</hi> reporteth himselfe to have nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly avoided death or extreame sicknesse, which he had gotten, by changing his English habit over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quickly into a Russian apparell. For the sodaine change of any ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bituated Custome, is so dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, that sometimes ordinary things disused bring on the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of death. Wherefore by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, the forces of custome are to be mollifyed or hardned accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the nature and customes
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:51440:27"/>
of the place, to which we intend to Travell, that when we come to the mature places of observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; we may shew no infections of bitternesse and spleene. This preparation being orderly practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, we ought to proceed warily to the chiefest places of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. I call not those places the chiefest, wherÃ© the Court doth usually reside, (which sometimes chooseth the most pleasant, not fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous places) but those Cities, which are most ancient, popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, noble, best served with merchandizes, and if thou hast any smacke of learning, where there is some <hi>Academy;</hi> as in <hi>France, Paris,</hi> and <hi>Monpellier;</hi> in <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly, Rome Bonona,</hi> and <hi>Padua: in</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:51440:27"/>
               <hi>Spaine Toledo</hi> and <hi>Salamanca;</hi> in <hi>Germany Strausburg,</hi> and <hi>Basill:</hi> from the happy concurrence of which famous places, not only all sorts of exquisite learning but the very genius of urbanity, and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility; and the sum of all profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Conversation is to be enjoyed. In which places commerces of all sorts are used, the Treasure of all humane knowledge is layed up, and all other conveniences to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance a Travailour to the height of civill knowledge are to be found out. Here also are not only bookes Containing all sciences, (which may perhaps not over please, the unstable heads of some jetting passengers) but the most humane and lively Volumes
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:51440:28"/>
of famous men; whose discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, exercises, and polite conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (if they be seriously admitted into a mans minde) are the best e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitomes of those regions. In such places, as in the <hi>Cyerhan</hi> groves, and <hi>Parnassean</hi> hils, a Travellour resolving to stay; he ought so to frame and settle himselfe, that his mind be not precipitate, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constant, and so may loose, by to nimble and frequent motion, its due and observable considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: and least by to nimble de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting out of the right path of Iudgement, it may not shew the sudden Capacity of an Ingenious, understanding, but the heady rashnesse and too apprehensive wearinesse ofa stable happinesse.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:51440:28"/>
To this observation, succeedeth, that a Travellour having Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, with learned men, should first rather endeavour to learne, then be ready to speake, and to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand then to teach. First it is a great and especiall hinderance of wisedome to speake much; and to desire the opinion of a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy orator, without knowledge or sufficiency. For pride and a bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Carriage then usuall, are vices most contrary to the humility of Instruction; which vices striving to send forth the sounds of an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogant expression, often shew a selfe love and ignorant vanity in the speaker. We must therefore labour to observe with a gentle, and quiet behaviour, being quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:51440:29"/>
rather, with the desire of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, then, wearied with the distast of information. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (as many doe) let us thinke our selves in the gallery, before we are entered into the parlour. For many (as <hi>Seneca</hi> well adviseth,) had arrived unto the perfection of learning; if they had not sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed themselves perfect to soone. This evill is to be avoided, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is most common, and yet not so common as dangerous. For now a daies nothing is so usuall, as for some proud, swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, empty, unskilfull gul gallant to fall into the extremity of arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant babling; and being intoxica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the heat of vaine glory, and selfe love, to boile out trifles,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:51440:29"/>
and ridiculous language. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this vice be to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred every where, as a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe which is a very great ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, unto all quiet and sober com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication; yet especially it is to be shunned by a Travellour into forraigne Countries, unto whom all things ought to seeme strange, and new; unlesse he desire to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare imprudent, or at at least<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise improvident. And therefore <hi>Lipsius</hi> speaketh aptly: Almost every man of the meanest sort can babble, wander, discourse fop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pishly, and ramble without feare or wit from one place to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother: but few can learne and search with quietnesse and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion; which is the true end of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:51440:30"/>
Travelling. Refer therefore more to thy Instruction, and sufficiency reall, then to the vaine glorious ostentation of babling, and to that infectious itch of immetho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicall prating. Neither unfitly only doth the over-nimble dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courser in forraigne Countries let slip his words, but sometimes dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerously. For it is a very hard thing for a man that talketh much, sometimes not to faile: although he knoweth the matter of which he discourseth: but it is imposible for a man which knoweth not the manners and customes of the men and place before whom and where he is, to deliver his minde, not to erre and sometimes most grossely to be deceaved. Therefore
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:51440:30"/>
let every wise Travellour, with as much care as he may, sacrifice unto the two shrines, to wit, of memory and silence: to memory, that he may hold fast all things, which are good and profitable (for he shall according to the phrase of <hi>Martiall,</hi> see some few good things, many indifferent, and very many ill examples:) and that also he may refuse the things, which are not Convenient for a well nurtured education to follow: like those strong and profitable scaines or nets, which reserve the great and large fishes, but let the worthlesse small fry drop backe againe into the sea. Let him also sacrifice to silence, if not equally, yet in a plentifull mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:51440:31"/>
because he which according to the Poet, is like water in a sieve, is to full of holes to reserve with judgement any matter of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant consequence. But thou art rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to reply; or rather perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily question me. Dost thou pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit a Travellour to use thebenefit of his Tonuge, which is most acceptable to most men, and often serveth better then a carvoch to passe away the dull houres. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that my purpose is not to stop their mouthes, which with discretion can bridle their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course: but only thus much I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish thee, that thou beest not a perpetuall utterer of thy owne concernements. <q>Take liberty (in gods name, faith a wise man;)
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:51440:31"/>
of speaking, not only on the way, but in the Inne, if thou fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest fit company: yea in any convenient place, neither only before supper, but at, and after it. But let thy speech tend to some one of these ends; which seeke and enquire of the manners, lawes, site, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of each city; I adde, which discourse of the Princes, warres Events, and whatsoever is rare and unusuall. But alwaies thinke more wisedome to be placed in few then many words, so the questions be apposite and pithy.</q> Seeke and enquire there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore rather like a scholler, then like a Teacher. Discourse of other mens actions, resound not thy owne
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:51440:32"/>
knowledge or vaine glorious praises.</p>
            <p>For that Travellour, which can abstaine from any glosse of his owne commendations, cometh neere the rundell of perfection, and is both happy, and Iudicious. To the discreet modesty of which elocution, two observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons do occur: the first is alwaies to endeavour (if thou hast not given thy name unto the muses and their instructions, whereby to increase, or at least wise lay the foundation of the neighbouring languages) to get the acquaintance of honest and learned men. From these many helpes may be easily obtained. For by their meanes thou shalt be able to view and understand, all the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:51440:32"/>
ancient and moderne monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, worthy the sight in the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tys thou passest, thou shalt have the entrance into the most famous li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braries, schooles, and Colledges, and see, not only the outward furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but the inmost riches, of those happy receptacles: besides by the company of these, thou shalt avoide all those circumfora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous and light headed ramblers, which insinuate themselves, and their companies into the society of unbridled young Travellours, and often, by the corrupting of the manners, lead them into all manner of hazard. For most True is that sentence of a learned mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list: <hi>All those which indulge Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Courses, doe decline a follower</hi>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:51440:33"/>
               <hi>of Learning, and ingenuitie with a kind of detestation.</hi> And this great Commodity, shall they also, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, by this happy conversation: thatthey shall (if they will) recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy, what before hath beene in their manners amiste. For learning often doth profit more, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying that which before was corrupt, then by implanting after the emendation of our natures, that which is sincere; it being alwaies a greater labour to cleare, a woody and marish Country and to prepare, it then to sow it. If this be so, how much importeth it a wary &amp; experienced judgement (but most of all a raw and greene one,) to desire the company of learned and honest men; by whose
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:51440:33"/>
conversation; a mans minde is oftner wholesomely instructed, then vainely delighted? Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all these conveniences, most people of this latter age, doe strictly desire such company, and name those, most commonly, <hi>good fellowes, and boone associates,</hi> which please them with ridiculous passages, and whet their Luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious fancies, by flattering their effeminate <hi>Inclinations:</hi> and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre those assoure, and distastefull, which with their grave and serious admonitions open a way to vertue, and shut the passadges of vice: when contrariwise every discreet man, chuseth, a friend, as one would doe a medicine for his health, the more <hi>sharpe,</hi> the more
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:51440:34"/>
               <hi>sounde.</hi> And besides; Not only there is no benefit gotten, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorting with foolish and deboist Company, but rather an infinite heape of mischiefes; whilest from their frivolous, and infectious dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, the hearers draw mudde, rather then water; and take pains to quench their thirst, not in a river, but a Poole. For rightly sayd that wise man <hi>Seneca,</hi> We sooner accustome our selves to learne the ill qualities of those, which are indifferently good, then their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. So <hi>Alexander</hi> the great (as <hi>Quintilian</hi> reporteth,) drew some vitious Imitations, from his master <hi>Leonidas,</hi> which being a valiant and martiall Emperour, he could not shake off. <hi>Marcus Tullius</hi> also
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:51440:34"/>
recordeth of some fantasticall Rhetoricians, which being not able to expresse, the severall gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and exellencies of their tutours, endeavoured only to follow, and imitate, such frivolous gestures, which were most unproper for either of them. So easily doe most men fall downewards, and so prompt and ready a thing it is, to decline from the rough way of rough and laborious progresse of vertue, into the obvious path of vice and slothfullnesse. True there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is that saying of <hi>Nilus,</hi> The first passages of vertue, and Ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous proceedings seeme hard unto the disciple, because the nature of man from it's very Infancy, is conversant in all license and idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:51440:35"/>
but to those which armed with noble resolution, have p<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ssed unto the middest of this steepe ascent; the way seemeth altogether light and easy. For our ill manners being better qualifyed, with the mixture of good cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes, at the length are quite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolished with the memory of those pleasures, which abhorre from reason. Of the force and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy prevalency of this sloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full custome, another learned mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralist named <hi>Diadochus</hi> hath these words. Great is the force of Custome, as well in society as in all other things. For out of use pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth a habit, from a habit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riseth a naturall necessity. Which to change ismost hard, nay some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:51440:35"/>
impossible. It beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth him therfore which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireth to travaile with profit, and safetie, neither much to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire company, nor (yet) to mixe with confused troopes; or yet to ramble to every meeting of strange and vnknowne persons. For the going abroad upon small occasions, consumeth most pretious time; and the conversing with every triviall companion, either draweth foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish and dangerous tautology; or enticeth a man from those di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciplines and exercises, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he addicted himselfe unto without hinderance. Let there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a wise man abstaine from the ordinary and confused com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:51440:36"/>
of men, and let him endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to consort himselfe with those, from whom he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceave profitable information. For it doth often happen, that those which are strangers, and doe without much warinesse deliver their mindes and opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, are often ensnared by some certaine crafty Promoters or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <note place="margin">Oh how true is this.</note> take away not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly such trifles as ones purse, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie and raiment: but also when they have done that and much more, these men being consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of their own unworthinesse and obnoxious to the torments of an unquiet conscience, they intice the secure prater into some
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:51440:36"/>
velitation or strife of language, which being by them craftily exaggerated, at length grows in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to or produces a capitall crime. And so often perisheth with his unprofitable, and row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling eloquence, that unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py travellour, whose aime and vaine-glory, is to be knowne &amp; honored by his rowling tongue. Let therfore every man, which pretendeth to enjoy the least dramme of discretion, judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously and advisedly consider what, and before whom hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth to speak: neither let him weigh only his conscience, the plaine meaning and sence of those things which he is about to declare; but the consequence
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:51440:37"/>
of those things he purposeth to discourse on, and the fidelity of the hearers before whom those flying words are to be let slipp. For there are many, especially in forraigne Nations (amongst whom much is consecrated to guile, and little to honesty) which are of soe heady and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward a malice, that they study, endeavour, and labour nothing more, then to entice men into the snares of hasty language, from the dangerous implications of which, a sodaine ruine may like some quick flashes of light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, arise. Therefore let every wary Travellour; set a watch upon his lipps, (which <hi>Homer</hi> calleth <hi>septum Dentium) sive</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">

to participate thy counsels, be heeded: because true friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship is rightly conglutinated, <q>and ioyned amongst none, but those which be equalls; and although one may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equall before this knot, yet doth it allwaies after this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocall affection, equalize them into the same degree of fortune, and correspondence:</q> rightly therefore speaketh that eloquent Roman Lawyer. <hi>Minu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius faelix: Friendship doth alwaies either finde or make men equalls.</hi> And St. <hi>Hierom let a particular man glister with golden robes, and from his large chestes, let his shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning plate be produced.</hi> Charity cannot be exceeded; love and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:51440:41"/>
affection are not to be bought with money: Friendship which once can end, hath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver beene true or sincere. Thence also hath proceeded that ancient proverbe of the Greekes; <hi>That all things amongst friends are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon:</hi> because the parity and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality of their minds doth so communicate all outward goods of fortune, that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the one can never be a hinderance unto the meanesse of the other. But this parity of mindes, seemes rather to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede, from the source of their common inclination to vertue, and not from the contrary ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent quality. Which consent is so rare, and in a manner so
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:51440:41"/>
impossible to find, that we may easily conjecture the hardnesse of it from this one demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration. For who almost amongst the generall and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne sort of people, doth not desire to creepe into his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours secrets with the intent to destroy him, with a subtle and crafty intention, being rather ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for ruine, then prepared to require the mutuall aide, and helpe of a friend? Many faire glozes and shewes may be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy (perhaps) amongst the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of our equalls, many plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, and enticing pretences; Oh how either of favour with true! superiour magistrates, by interposing some efficacious
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:51440:42"/>
petitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, or by directing our fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar affaires, in a seeming smooth Course; which subtleties are wonderfully affected, by those which rather desire to abandon, then to seeke cordially for true friendship: Whereby they may perswade raw young men, that they are most honest and right hearted good natures, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps by these sleights, they may purchase the opinion of wise men, being the more able by these jugglings to set upon the secure innocent, now over con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident of their fidelities: when at the same moment in their hearts reigneth all sort of guile, envy, malice, hatred, emulation and heart-burnings, which like
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:51440:42"/>
the <hi>Trojans</hi> out of the fatall horse of <hi>Epeus,</hi> doe with a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of most strange and sodaine calumniations, rush out upon their seeure enemy, and drive him into perpetuall ruine and despaire. What feare, amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, griefe, and horrour falleth then upon those, which giving credit, unto these mens <hi>Syrenian</hi> enchantments, thought all their secrets, and open follies to be buried in oblivion.

then live according to those pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, which are the means of health. So these improvident men would rather permit all their affaires to meere chance, and the uncertaine current of the times, then to regulate themselves, in choosing the demonstrations of experience. To these men puffed up with the opinion of their own sufficiency (that I may passe over the sluggish heaviness of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) we write not; nor greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly desire those mens tastes; whose stomackes being already filled with crude humours, doe not only contemne (as the Poet speaketh) ordinary viands, but soone disgust the purest elixar of philosophy. To these I say,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:51440:44"/>
I propose not the hard fates of sundry armies, regions, cities, Ilands, which have sodainly pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished, with to much confidence and presumption ossecurity. But before these mens faces I exhibite the idea of their conversations, selected out of choice and true Histories; which have brought upon themselves sodaine deaths, and most unfortunate ruines, by over: much trust unto those which have deceaved their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions, and carryed two faces under one hood. Let therefore any supine or negligent frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of every publique society they meet, look upon the conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy of <hi>Vibulenus</hi> against <hi>Blaesus</hi> mentioned in the first booke of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:51440:45"/>
               <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi> his Annals: and afterwards let him ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, the fained and guile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full friendship of <hi>Caepio Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spinus,</hi> towards his <hi>Praetor</hi> of <hi>Bythinia, Granius Marcellus:</hi> who having receaved from him, both encrease of many honours, and divers other bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, because he could <hi>Not to his owne desires encrease his fortunes,</hi> accused his friend unto that most cruell Emperour. <hi>Tiberius,</hi> that he spoke ill against and inveighed at the wicked and dissolute life of the Emperour. This mans ill example (faith <hi>Cor.</hi> farther) did <hi>Romanus Hispo,</hi> and many others follow; which enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring into many mens lives and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:51440:45"/>
actions, did continually search about for some occasion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to feede the cruell desires of their Tyrannicall Prince. Hence (saith my author) many poore rascalls following this promoter, became rich, which by these base and unworthy practises from the most meane places of birth and fortune, lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up their heads, were upon a sodaine growne to be most powerfull and fortunate. Turne to the 7. chap. of the second booke of <hi>Annals,</hi> and there thou fhalt find <hi>Libo Drusus</hi> accused of treason by his most intimate and familiar friend <hi>Firmus Cato. Drusus</hi> (it is the historians re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port) by his ill and deboist
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:51440:46"/>
example, this <hi>Cato,</hi> enticed and lead on to all lasciviousnesse; and afterwards drew him into debt; and engaged his land in morgages and usury: And most faithfully for a Time did he deale with this his friend in their common affaires; untill he had gotten firme arguments and witnesses to make good what he perfidiously intended. These being once ready he openeth his accusation unto <hi>Fla. Vescularius,</hi> and thus under the <hi>appearance of Friendship,</hi> through most ignoble treachery, he brought his friend into the most hard extremity, he possibly could devise. But the desperate youth suspecting and beginning to vent this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidious
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:51440:46"/>
accusation, declined into that height of griefe and passion, that he ran himselfe through the body with his owne rapier. But this moderne example rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Samuell Bruno</hi> in his Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugall voyage; is a most exact testimony of the infidelity of many which make faire shewes and professe, at the beginning of their acquaintance, much secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. There is a law (saith <hi>Bruno)</hi> in <hi>Spaine,</hi> that it is lawfull for no man whatsoever (except those merchants which bring corne or other necessary provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion into the Country) to carry thence any coine stamped in the Kings mint: He which trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresseth this law without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption

is sold, and bound to the oare as a gally-slave; (and) his goods and ship confiscated. It fortuned at my being at <hi>Lis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone</hi> there rode in the Haven 4. ships; two of <hi>Roterdam,</hi> one of <hi>Enchuisen,</hi> and one also of <hi>Acker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slought,</hi> in these there was hidden besides many gemmes of the orientall Indies, great store of coined money. Three of the ships assoone as they might, hoised saile and departed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out discovery. But the fourth, (being one of the <hi>Roterdam,</hi> ships) staied unfortunately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind. For the master or chiefe marchant of that ship, by name <hi>Cornelius Hoppo,</hi> a man well thought on, and of good esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estimation
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:51440:47"/>
amongst his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try men, had entertained a young fellow for his scribe or secretary, which at the first ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance seemed to be very to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, and discreet: but was indeed a very malitious, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solent natur'd fellow. This scribe a little before their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of departure, entreated his master to lend him 500 Rials of 8. which (because he refused to give an accompt how he meaned to dispend them,) being denied, he most malitiously and treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously forthwith repaired to the magistrate, accusing his master, and other of his Countrymen for carrying away coined silver against the Law. Vpon this
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:51440:48"/>
accusation; forthwith foure Spanish gallies filled with ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med souldiers, are directed to search the ship, which forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they did, found the moneys, and tooke away the other merchandise. But yet this base promooter had no share of the prize (according to the law, which assigneth a third part to the accuser) so that in this part, the proverbe was verifyed. The treason is often well liked, when the trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour is not regarded. This ship was after sold, by the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour unto some merchants of <hi>Germany.</hi> Thus far <hi>Bruno.</hi> Not unlike is that practise of <hi>Hen.

The history is worth a reading and over-large to be in this place inserted. To these (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides what ordinary experience may afford) I could adde infinite store of examples out of <hi>T. Livi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, C. Tacitus; Val. Maxumus; Amm.

Therefore a travellour must be admonished with especiall heed, that whilst he resideth amongst unknowne men in a forraigne Country, he

make not to bold, or be to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitive into their secret af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires.</p>
            <p>And this caution is for three especiall reasons, to be adhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. First least by mingling some thing of our affaires, we may make our selves suspected to our owne Country: and so we may returne either unwellcome, or our returne be forbidden. Thus was <hi>Reginald Poole,</hi> and <hi>R. Allen</hi> both English Cardinals out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawed and proscribed, for dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in forraigne affaires and seeking the ruine of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Secondly least by over curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously enquiring of the holies, or secret politicall affaires of other nations, we may by chance let
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:51440:58"/>
fall some words, which may draw on an Inconvenience upon us, or may be ill taken by wise men. Most <note place="margin">A strange History.</note> strange is that rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which <hi>S. Bruno</hi> a switzer and Chyrurgion to the fortresse of <hi>Nassaw</hi> in the East Indies hath committed to memory in his second African Iournall; which is not altogether unfitting to be applyed to this <hi>Topicall</hi> caution. Being not farre from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montory of <hi>Capo Monte</hi> amongst the <hi>AEthiopians</hi> or <hi>Negroes</hi> dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling there abouts, he had heard his Cap. <hi>Thomas Peetersou</hi> a Flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shinger say, that the devill of late had made in the adjoining woods a most horrible noise,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:51440:58"/>
Imperiously requiring sacrifices to be performed unto him.</p>
            <p>Whereupon I enquired, where those sacrifices should be made; who told me hard by, in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyning grove: but that none would be admitted to the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of these infernall holies (but the King whose name was <hi>Thaba Flamor</hi> his nobles and counsellors.) At the day appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted I my selfe, quoth <hi>Bruno,</hi> heard a most inarticulate and hollow terrible noise: and saw how those woemen and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren (which for the meanesse of their condition could not be admitted to the sacrifice,) ran a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to their houses and caves with extreme feare. After this I
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:51440:59"/>
saw divers and many sortes and dishes of meat to be carried into the wood, as rice, venizon, hens, wine and a drinke called Mellicratos of an excellent taste. Being desirous to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this extraordinarie cheere was conveyed, I presently found a Companion of mine which had been in those places before: but assoone as the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> saw us come neere they howled out, extreamely threatning us, that if we did ofter to stirre one foot forward, without mercy their gods, (or rather devils) <hi>Suangi,</hi> and <hi>Cricry</hi> would teare us in pieces. We notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their menaces and threats came nearer, which the devill
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:51440:59"/>
perceaving and being unwilling to be troubled with the presence of any Christians, did so violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vrge his black coloured infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall servants, that they most grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viously beat S. <hi>Bruno</hi> and his companion, that they left them for dead in the place, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding they at last got home to the ships: and a while after resorted to <hi>Thaba t lamour</hi> the King, with their Captaine for satisfaction, telling that swarthy Monarch, that no merchants would hence forwards trade in his country, if the nation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out due satisfaction should offer such cruel wrongs. The king ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving heard them out, told them that whatsoever had beene done,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:51440:60"/>
was effected by the command of <hi>Cry cry</hi> alone; and that we could not with any reason com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of injury. For since their nationall <hi>rites</hi> and <hi>holies</hi> did not pertaine to us; we rather ought to abstaine from the <hi>curious search</hi> thereof; because we came not thither for any devotion or good will, but rather to enquire of their ceremonies and deride them. Vpon the hearing of this speech, the Captaine was (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly) pacyfiyed, as supposing the contents to be not altogether unreasonable. The devill had perswaded this miserable King, that he should fly from place to place after his death, and be his inseparable companion; which
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:51440:60"/>
hee tooke for a great favour. <hi>Ric. Iohnson</hi> in his voyage to the <hi>Samoyeds</hi> Country, beyond the river <hi>Obb,</hi> also informeth us, of their strange iugglings, mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous incantetions, and devil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish sacrifices of deare and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine fowles, which they were most unwilling to let him see; telling him that the being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent at their clamorous sacrifices, would be dangerous. And (if my memory fail me not) as I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber I have read of a voyage in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the North of <hi>Greenland,</hi> where the English found some of the savage Inhabitants sacrificing at a fire, which they would not goe into, neither come neere the smoke; but would have had the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:51440:61"/>
English have come neer, which they shunned fearing danger, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til at last the fire was put out. Also most strange are those sacrifices, of the sunne; which <hi>Fer. Magag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianes</hi> mentioneth, he saw per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by some old <hi>Beldames</hi> at the Iland of <hi>Mathan,</hi> not farre from <hi>Zubut,</hi> which is about 50 leagues from <hi>Cattaghan.</hi> Neither come behind, for monstrous and cruell Impiety, those ancient sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices of the <hi>Peruvians</hi> and <hi>Mexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans</hi> in the <hi>West-India's,</hi> who consumed many thousands of men yeerely to their <hi>Vitziliputzli,</hi> and thought to prohibit the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance of the Spaniards by these inhumane butcheries.</p>
            <p>Also we must advise our tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellour,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:51440:61"/>
not to be over-inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive into the secrets of other Countries, especially, of <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and commerce;</hi> because often such have been taken for spies, as appeareth in the history of <hi>Iohn Newbery</hi> and his Companions at <hi>Ormus</hi> and <hi>Goa</hi> recorded by <hi>Io. Huighen Van Lins<gap reason="illegible: over-inked" extent="1 letter">

This
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:51440:62"/>
is also the reason that all those Eastern nations of <hi>Russia, Cathaia, Tartaria China</hi> suffer few for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigners to goe back for their Countries, being once admitted; least they should informe of their manner and quality of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. But especially the <hi>Chinois</hi> or as they name them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves the <hi>Tamegnies,</hi> are herein most scrupulous. Thirdly we must avoide to much nicety in observation, lest that by mingling confused notions together, we loose our times of studying; and so often a Travellour beginneth to think himselfe a <hi>Doctor;</hi> before he rightly be accompted a <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.</hi> but especially the first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of fidelity towards
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:51440:62"/>
ones proper Country is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded. For unto this one thing, as to the sole end and Terminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ought all our politicall inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and actions to be reduced; to wit, that we may profit &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit our Country. Neither can there be almost any deed so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull or hainous which doth exceede the treachery intended against a mans Country. Because this, as a publique parent doth require a higher measure of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, then either respect of father or mother; children, wife, or Kinsemen: by how much more publique happinesses, and permanencies doth prevaile with all good minds, more then private affaires. Miserable (there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:51440:63"/>
and most execrable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is that impiety, and ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude which in forraigne or Transmarine regions doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to disturbe the peace and commodities of a mans proper Countrey, wherin it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed God to give him being and education For this vice of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition sheweth the will, and not the necessity (which here hath no place at all.) And certaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this kind there are no clearer examples of unnaturall and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble perfidy then in that history which the L. Bishop <hi>G. Carle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> hath entitled a thankefull remembrance of Gods mercy; which conteineth the home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred and forraigne treasons of
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:51440:63"/>
the English and others inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded against the sacred persons of Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and K. <hi>Iames.</hi> Yet may not forthwith this odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous title of a conspirator or <hi>Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tefeaux</hi> be imposed upon every one; which in forraigne parts moveth himselfe something more then ordinary in appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance against the moderne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of his Country. For (as it seemeth to me) these three causes, may excuse an active man moving against the affaires ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour of his owne nation, without admittance of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer odious title. The first excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, if that a man travell into transmarine regions, to this. end and purpose that he may by
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:51440:64"/>
his sufficient insinuations into forraigne affaires profit the same: and that he may restore it into a better state by exotique physick, being now mortally ill and sicke by the many distempers of ill government. The truth of which canon may bee appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the examples, and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of divers famous, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy men: As of <hi>Themistocles,</hi> which fled rather then travelled into <hi>Persia</hi> and insinuated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe into the fauour of the King by professing himselfe an enemy to his owne nation: and by this meanes as also by repressing or moderating the powers of <hi>Tissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phernes,</hi> did more good to his friends at <hi>Athens;</hi> then when
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:51440:64"/>
he compelled <hi>Xerxes</hi> to fly through the <hi>Hellespont</hi> in a single pinnace. <hi>So Cyrus</hi> the Persian monarch receaved into his power, the city of <hi>Babylon</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traied unto him by his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject <hi>Araspis,</hi> which fled thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for prostituting the wife of <hi>Abradates:</hi> or rather as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers report, so <hi>Darius</hi> the sonne of <hi>Hystaspis</hi> triumphed over the afore mentioned ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by the helpe of his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full servant <hi>Zopyrus,</hi> as <hi>Trogus</hi> in the end of his first booke informeth Vs. In this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner did <hi>Tarquinius sextus</hi> yeeld up unto his father the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of <hi>Gabium,</hi> having gotten credit from his enemies by
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:51440:65"/>
betraying some counsels of the Romans; and by mutilating or wounding himselfe; reporting it to be the cruell deed of his tyrannicall father. So <hi>Hanniball</hi> flying from the destruction of his Countrey, unto <hi>Antiochus</hi> the <hi>Indian</hi> monarch, under pretence of Counsell, did more good to his afflicted Countreymen at <hi>Carthage,</hi> then to either <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Zusa.</hi> So <hi>Alcibiades</hi> although banished by his Citizens, and flying to <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> opened cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine passages of state against his Country, yet by acquaintance with the wife of <hi>Agis</hi> their titu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar King, and by signifying their preparations, did expell a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending mis<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:51440:65"/>
So <hi>Phocyon, Aristides, Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sthenes, Tullius, Seneca,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others ancient and moderne, although some were banished and some travelled voluntarily out of their Countrey, yet either with their persons, or counsells they were never wanting to their friends.</p>
            <p>The second defence against this unhappy attribute may arise from this subsequent originall. For it seemeth not unjust that noble men debarred of their titles should enter againe or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther returne into their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, to claime those honors which are due unto them. Wherefore in my opinion <hi>Corio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hm,</hi> and <hi>Tarquinius</hi> are not so
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:51440:66"/>
much to be reprehended: (nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth of <hi>England,</hi> because in armour ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with warlike troopes he returned into his Countrey from <hi>Burgundie,)</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they came but to challenge their ancient titles; and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed amendement of their former offences. The same, (perhaps) is to be thought, of <hi>Henry</hi> sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named <hi>Bullingbrooke</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing condemned unto banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by <hi>Richard</hi> of <hi>Burdeaux</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> under pretence of suing his livery for the Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> (he being ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished Earle of <hi>Hereford)</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned againe before his time into <hi>England</hi> and landed, under
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:51440:66"/>
this pretence, with armed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne troopes at <hi>Ravenspurg</hi> in the North. Wherefore those men are not to be thought, in my opinion, traitours to their Countrey; which returne to seek that which by the Law of nations, and nature, of right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to them; neither when they are mingled with the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of other commonwealths, (perchance) not belonging unto them, but rather contrariwise sometimes dangerous, if so bee, by these courses, they may in future bee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> profitable to their Country, or in some measure, without manifest disadvantage unto their Country, profit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. The truth of which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:51440:67"/>
appeareth in the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed voyages of many tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellours, which passed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed with good leave unto the <hi>East Indias.</hi> But it is especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to be observed by us; that whilst we seeke our owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, we invade not, the rights of other men. For if we offer at this unjustice, forthwith will, without doubt, arise amongst us ruine, sedition, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of our common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; (although sometimes perhaps the author be but a meane private man; and often that mischiefe followeth, which <hi>Aristophanes</hi> remembreth in the Comedy of the <hi>Acarnanians.</hi>

            </q>
            <p>The third defence against this vice of over much activity, or rather bound, which keepes it within the order of fidelity; yet permits a travellour to mingle Counsels, &amp; friendly to discourse with the enemies of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey; so that he avoide the vice of impious treachery, and doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to doe his Country or Countreymen good. And this course without any offence to
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:51440:68"/>
their citizens, tooke <hi>Themistocles, Thrasibulus, Zopyrus, Harmodius</hi> and <hi>Aristogiton, Chariton</hi> and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalippus; Neanthes, Cycizenus</hi> and <hi>Nicomachus.</hi> Yet notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding some of these by the unru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly multitude had before bin ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished unjustly from their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and grieveously mulcted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all equity.

holy duty; which continually undergoeth not only the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and dangers common to other men, but also undertaketh sometimes a combat with dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers themselves. And to this religious feare of god, let the love of our countrey succed in the next place. For rightly saied he, which told us; that fidelity yeelded to a friend is a great or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament, (and) trust performed and duty to our parents is a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but to our Country stability yeelded is the greatest of all. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shall wee find any men of fame and honor celebrated in history, which did not flourish with an immaculate love of their Country. The truth of this

axiome may appeare in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned relations of <hi>Codrus, Themistocles, Timoleon,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst ours, of the <hi>Horatii, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bii, Camilli, Curtii, Bruti, Ciceroues,</hi> which to their eternall honor are commended (nay almost deifyed) in fames never dying register, for their inviolate fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to their Country in its most sodaine and heavy dangers; which they like noble and truly renowned patriots bought out with their owne lives. For all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies amongst generous spirits have publique affaires beene pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before private, although sometimes those private have not a little concerned the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique also. Most Heroique (if

I tell you it is har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to moderate a mans selfe in felicity, which hee looketh not

To speake more of dying, or to use many words of that argument, I take to proceede of a cowardly cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.

The first part of which ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is most exactly to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by a travellor into forraigne regions. For what can be more dangerous then for a stranger to devoure strange, and unknowne meates: perhaps although deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious yet in their owne natures poisonous. Such are the most beautifull apples growing neere <hi>Ierico</hi> (of which <hi>W.

Such are those dangerous Druggs of <hi>Petum</hi> amongst the <hi>Brasilians, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pium</hi>

bringeth upon thee all sort of diseases, since there is nothing so miserable expensive as a glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, which eateth that he may surfet; and surfetteth that he may eate.

Of these a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst forraigners great care must be taken. For if this <hi>Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,</hi> or rather furious rage of the most unbridled passion, which tempteth mankind, be exceeding dangerous, covered with the best stratagems of this wicked art, (in which <hi>P. Ovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:51440:83"/>
and <hi>Io. Bocatius</hi> have to their owne disgrace, if not ruine, approved themselves masters) to those which remaine fixed in the same place of habitation: what shall we conceive of the great inconveniences, it bringeth forth, when we lye open to all forraign snares and temptations? besides, (which would be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked) Crimes creepe, nay sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainely rush and upon those which are secure: and to easily doe strange vices overcome those which are already wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed with domestique and home-bred passions. The force also of custome doth tickle an Intemperate man; whilst he thinketh it a part of great wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:51440:83"/>
to collect those things, and to practise them, which although (perhaps) rare, yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely are most vitious.</p>
            <p>And can there be a greater misery then for a man which in his own country was accounted to be wel and honestly educated, being intoxicated with the study of novelties; to become in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther climate, the very fosse, and sinke of all those vices, which either vanity hath invented, or luxury found out? Against these most pernitious foments of vice, there is no better antidote, then temperance; which also doth most prevalently resist, when the vice of incontinency doth but begin; and is of most power
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:51440:84"/>
when as yet, (in <hi>Ciceroes</hi> phrase) the Ramme of the enemy hath not shaken the wall: for as the Satyrist hath it:</p>
            <q>
               <l>In vaine then for terse hellebore wee cry,</l>
               <l>VVhen that wee are compel'd almost to die</l>
               <l>With heavy swellings, hee that will have ease,</l>
               <l>Must at the first prevent or cure disease.</l>
            </q>
            <p>For as a City which is well fortified is not subject to so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine Invasions; neither doth a Castle well munited with Ordinance and Bulwarks much feare Panique terrours: so a
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:51440:84"/>
minde inabled with the muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of fortitude most easily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth the enticements of vices; neither is sodainly conquered with the machinations of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pietie.</p>
            <p>For, an enemy which is ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with the darts of fortitude, doth not presently yeeld, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides it is the nature of <hi>Vice</hi> to creepe on by degrees, neither to fight at their first appearances, but rather to seeke ambuscadoes, working their feates rather by the helpe of deceipt, then prowesse. It is the saying of the Poet.</p>
            <q>
               <l>None on a sudden growes most vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Vice</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:51440:85"/>
Comes on by stealth, and slilie doth entice.</l>
            </q>
            <p>So mischiefes often trye by faire meanes, rather then by open force to assaile those, they would subject; and rather seeke opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to deceive, then a just warre. And like as heretofore many ancient Chieftaines did use to terrifie, by some strange strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems and sudden devices, their enemies; thinking it more safe to fright, them with panique feares then with Armes: So vice, whilst it artificially doth frame a combat, it placeth <hi>Intemperance</hi> perdue, as it were in the field, or sends this Monster as a spy into the little Isle of man; which by ill customes and enticements,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:51440:85"/>
may draw him into Voracitie, Gluttony and Incontinencie: which sprigs of Vices, like the darke pathes of errours, deceive and draw many men into most dangerous precipices; otherwise the most dissolute persons would abhor to act those things, which are undecent; if they were not newly varnished with some a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duleerate commixtions. Let <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance</hi> therefore be as a watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tower or lanthorne unto a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellour; by whose bright rayes, not clouded with the dark fumes of luxury, he may rightly steere his reason in this Sea of Adversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and so may preserve his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion untainted from any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modest word or deed.</p>

The second generall observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is referred to inquisition or enquiry, to wit, the enquiry of the Common-wealth, in which thou art conversant after the common romances &amp; conceipts of the vulgar. Then such inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition (except it be very moderate and discreet) there is nothing more vaine, unprofitable or empty. For certainly it is a most vaine and frivolous thing to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire about every sleight ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, which is set abroach by the common people, and to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of other mens affaires, as of our own; Since such men ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther amongst the learned, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the opinion of vaine curiosity, then learned Science.
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:51440:86"/>
This vice is by <hi>Caesar</hi> in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries and <hi>Nico Flisclinus</hi> in his <hi>Iulius Redivivus, Act.</hi> 2. <hi>Scen.</hi> 4. attributed to the barbarous <hi>Celtes</hi> or <hi>Gaules.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These men (quoth my Author) have a very barbarous and rude custome; for assoone as they see forreigne Merchants, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe them round in the streetes, and enquire most nicely of the state of those Forraigners from whence they come. The Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants being compelled by their importunities to answer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known or unfitting questions, many times invent such tales as may please them best, and seeme most credible; Which they hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, forthwith they set upon
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:51440:87"/>
their consultations, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to these relations dispose of their affaires; then the which there cannot be devised a more rash and inconsiderate folly. There are no people more mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable therefore then such men, which suffer their eares to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually filled with such newes; (which suppose they are strained upon the racke, if one day bee spent quietly and studiously.) Hence it is that such men, for the most part are perpetually subject to exorbitant passions, unquiet motions, and sudden feares; for being filled with choller and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, through the overmuch agilitie of their apprehensions, and the uncertainty of their reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:51440:87"/>
they continually have those galleries of reason, their heads stusted with the undige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted and crude rumours, which they so much affect and hunt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Of these <hi>Lucretius:</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <l>Some men inconstant in each City, feare</l>
               <l>The houses, lest in pieces they should teare</l>
               <l>Their limbes with falling: others least the ground</l>
               <l>Should gaping open and enclose thent round</l>
               <l>These panique terrors tell some that the earth</l>
               <l>Will now dissolve, and have another birth,</l>
               <l>And opening her <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>estie jawes, will fall</l>
               <l>Into a Chaos and thus ruine all.</l>
            </q>
            <p>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:51440:88"/>
Let this be therefore a cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be observed by a Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, not to take newes upon trust, concerning strange Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealthes: because hardly such an inquisitor can obtain any remarkeable knowledges, and yet is most subiect to be ensnared by promoters. Rather let choise and silent narrations (although fewer in number, and perchance not seeming to every companion so plausible, be his ayme,) such are the observations of Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, AEdifices, Libraries; the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions of the places of battels, and the changes of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of cities. In this path let moderation be also his guide: that if he happen to strike upon
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:51440:88"/>
some difficult passages, he may retract his footsteps, before he be to farregone.</p>
            <p>The third observation is more generall; to wit, that a travellour ought with his vigorous and festive carriage, to conjoine mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence according to his ability. For a poore, and ill accoutred tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellor is the most ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble creature in the <note place="margin">Nil habit infaelix pauper tas duri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us in se, quam quod re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculos homines facit.</note> world. All men in a manner, (such are these later times) are esteemed from their outward comportment; but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially travellours. To this magnificencie, let there be added a manly reservation, for some men attributing all their best
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:51440:89"/>
gestures to a kind of easinesse or (rather parasitisme) and dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating, whatsoever they can get from others or exhaust from their owne, to vaine ostentation, doe faile in the especiall parts of splendor, same and reputation. From this precipice we must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, <q>least that wee yeeld to much to exteriour pompe, and little or nothing to discreet me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diocrity.</q> For when once our familiar affaires, and the opinion of our credits are subjected to wast; it is scarse credible, how soone these buildings of our estates and fortunes decay. And therefore most wittily doth the Comaedian <hi>Plautus</hi> induce the young <hi>CavalerÃ² Philolaches</hi> in the
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:51440:89"/>
first <hi>Act.</hi> 2. <hi>Scene</hi> of his <hi>Com: Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stellaria,</hi> comparing himselfe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Carpenter, and his estate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a new building which unlesse it be perpetually repaired, and often new furbished;</p>
            <q>
               <l>Venit imber, lavit parietes, perpluunt</l>
               <l>Tigna, putrefacit aer operam fabri:</l>
               <l>Nequior jam factus est usus oedium.</l>
               <l>A tempest comes, the wals are wash'd, and all</l>
               <l>The strongest rafters soone begin to fall,</l>
               <l>Corrupted with the foggie aire; and streight</l>
               <l>The house decaying falls by its owne weight.</l>
            </q>
            <p>And no wonder is this sudden mutation (quoth <hi>Lucretius:)</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause.</p>
            <q>
               <l>
                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:51440:90"/>
The houses in the streets doe often shake,</l>
               <l>And mov'd by ratling Carres doe trembling quake.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Let magnificence therefore bee moderately mixed with this manly discretion: lest that wee overmuch contract the goods we have by the divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence allotted unto us: or (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the just care of a discreet ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward) suffer them over-nimbly and fluidly to slip from us.</p>
            <p>The fourth observation of a Travellour should be the study of the best things. For many there are which seeke forraigne Countries to no other end in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but to satisfie their sensuall pleasures. But <hi>Trismegistus, Apollo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:51440:90"/>
               <hi>Mercurius,</hi> and <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> the antient quaternio of travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours and wise men, to this end only did leave the sweet ayre of their Countreys, that they might returne enriched, with the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall magazine of knowledge.</p>
            <p>Neither travelled these Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies that they might only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the outward shapes, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances, and appearances of men; but that they might under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand their Manners, customes, languages, learning; and that they might be capable of those grounds and foundations, which may prove Canons and Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remes of future Sciences. Let therefore a travellour heare of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous Polititian, or learned
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:51440:91"/>
Scholler, but let him endeavour (if he may) to bee his Visitant, and rather let him study to see such a miracle of science; then the lofty buildings of the most aspiring Cities; that he may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand from this Oracle of the Muses those things, which may both delight and instruct him. Thus many learned judicious travellours (even from the rising of the Patron of the Muses) came to <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Padua,</hi> to visit <hi>T Livi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> the most exquisite builder of all prophane Histories. Thus as yet is <hi>Cor. Tacitus</hi> honoured in most moderne languages: and amongst the starres of this latter age <hi>Erasmus, Vives, Polidorus, Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retus, Lipsius, Gruterus, &amp;c.</hi> were
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:51440:91"/>
in their houses, schooles, studies, visited with no small (I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most said) adoration. Let also a travellour passe by no Library of worth, (but if that opportunity may permit) without searching and observing it, committing to memory those things there which he findeth rare, and not regarding those sleight vanities, which the Market or Tavernes may afford. These judicious speculations also being referred to this one and onely end, that at his returne he may excell in the <hi>Knowledge of the best things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this let there be added, a constant resolution. In all busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse whatsoever we undertake the chiefe ornament and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:51440:92"/>
is constancy: especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in those things, which take force from our resolutions. In this purpose of travel (if we may beleve Iudicious <hi>Lipsius)</hi> there is need of a twofold caution, that our intent be well founded; and then that it be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>stant. For a mind that is mutable, gathers not the juice of erudition. Because it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploieth the times of discipline to please extravagant passions. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>screet frugality is an excellent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy against these. But frugality it self is a most vain &amp; idle name, yea often the cover of wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and penury, unlesse judicious moderation may be the director of our expences. Then indeed our manner of living truly shineth, &amp;
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:51440:92"/>
strengthened with the glory of reason, groweth famous. Avoid also the distraction of businesse, which often hindereth the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of a travellour.</p>
            <p>For a iudicious man underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not his peregrination, to be pragmaticall after the manner of lawyers, but when his leasure serveth him, that he may observe by action; because he often, which is to busy in the practique part, can hardly learne any thing, whilst he doth spend his time in superficiall follies, or need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse businesse, and so both lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth science, and experience. <hi>Then which, what is more ridiculous?</hi> For the age of man being distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, and separated into proper
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:51440:93"/>
seasons, hath unto them opposed severall faculties. And youth (for in our childish yeares some men prohibit us to travell) seemeth to be the middle centre of <hi>Practise</hi> and <hi>Theorie.</hi> Let therefore time be so allotted, and distributed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy businesse, that thou mayst not bee inforced to neglect the due seasons of meditation. At all, and in all ages it is most conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to meditate; <hi>Neither is there any degree in the world that may not be adorned, and advanced by learning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this part adde the modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thy gesture and behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; for as speech is the Index of the minde: so is gesture a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of thy naturall inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:51440:93"/>
So <hi>Ambrose</hi> is reported to have refused the service of two Deacons in the Church, being offended with the levitie of their behaviour; besides, nothing is so mutable as gesture, or more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to censure in Forraigne parts; whose opinions, who of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten lightly doth contemne, is without doubt to be accounted of a Dissolute inclination.</p>
