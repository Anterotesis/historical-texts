            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>May it please your Lordship, and you Gentlemen of the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, this is an Action brought by <hi>Henry,</hi> Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> against one <hi>John Jermaine:</hi> The Plaintiff sets forth, That the First of <hi>April,</hi> in the Second Year of the Reign of the late King <hi>James,</hi> the Defendant did, by unlawful Ways and Means, Intice away his Dutchess, by which means he had not the benefit of her Society; and, by lascivious Conversation, committed Adultery with her, and caused her to commit Adultry: And this he layeth to his Dammage 100000 <hi>l.</hi>
               </p>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49689:3"/>
Jury, this is a very melancholy thing to be told; yet it is fit the Age we live in may know it; so as the Offender may be punished. The Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> is the first Duke in <hi>England;</hi> Enstalled Knight of the most Noble Order of the Garter; Lord High Marshal of <hi>England,</hi> and one of the Lords of Their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties most honourable Privy Council: And he to be abused, perhaps none found any such Cause to come before any Court. It is a hard thing, as this Case is, for us to produce strong and pregnant Evidence: But our Proofs are such, as I am ashamed to repeat them; but desire the Witnesses may tell your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships, and the Gentlemen of the Jury, what they know: It was not kept se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, but it was known so, as all the Kingdom did ring of it; and how the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant had the Dutchess frequently to his House; and how they lived in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery: My Lord, we will take that Method that is most plain.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I was House-maid and Servant to the Dutchess in the first Year of King <hi>James</hi>'s Reign; about <hi>Bartholomew</hi>-tide my Lady Dutchess went to <hi>London</hi> with <hi>Jermaine, Nell Gwynn,</hi> and some others, and we did not expect them to come home that Night, but she did, and after they went to Supper; after that they went to Cards; and then my Lady Dutchess had a great mind to go to Bed, and desired us to make her a Fire, and so we did, and my Lady went to Bed, and said, <hi>Tho' the King and Queen should send for me, I would not rise till Eleven a Clock to Morrow-morning.</hi> So the Candles were put out, and two Footmen stood to wait, because Mr. <hi>Jermaine</hi> used to be generous to the Servants; and they waited till Two a Clock in the Morning: I asked them whether Mr. <hi>Jermain</hi> had come down? and they said, No, for they had been there all the while; and if he came, he could not go, for, they said, we have laid Chairs and Stools in the way, that if he come, he might fall over them; and the next Morning I saw a Man with a Paper-Box in his hand, and he asked me for Mr. <hi>Jermain</hi>'s Chamber or Lodgings; I told him, I knew none he had there. My Lord, the next day my Lady Dutchess ordered me to make her a Fire, and Mrs. <hi>Kniveton</hi> was Combing her Head, and <hi>Nell Guynn</hi> came in, and said, Good Morrow, to your Grace; how did you rest last Night? She said, Well. Then Col. <hi>Cornwal</hi> came in, and said to my Lady Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chess, How doth Mr. <hi>Jermain</hi> do? And she said, Why do you ask me? And Col. <hi>Cornwal</hi> said, He did not lye at Home last Night. Then <hi>Nell Gwynn</hi> said, We shall see him come out by and by like a drowned Mouse. And so I went to make my Lady Dutchess's Bed, and found a Handkerchief and Ruffles. And Mrs. <hi>Kniveton</hi> came and said, Come hither, and I will shew you a sight; and when I came, there lay a Shirt and Wastcoat, and I took them away, because it was a place where any body, as they came, might see them. And my Lord Duke was not in Town.</p>

and about a year after he sent a Workman to me that he might make a Door out into the Park, and I did agree with him for a Buck or 40 <hi>s.</hi> in Money, which he pleased; and so a Door was made, but since he hath gotten a Door himself into the Park.</p>

                  </gap> there be any thing that hath any Tendency, it is that which <hi>Jane Wodsworth</hi> saith: And what is that which she saith? why, she being a Woman that Sold Ale, she had let a Pint Pot go to Mr. <hi>Jermaines</hi> House, so she went for it; and the <hi>Dutch</hi> Woman that lived there, directed her to go up the Stairs for the Pint Pot. She Sweareth that she saw the Dutchess of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and she had a Petticoat on; and this is the Evidence that she hath given. She doth not pretend that Mr. <hi>Jermaine</hi> was in the House or in Company with the Dutchess, and she appeareth to be a Stranger in the House, and yet she must Run up Stairs. As for her Reputation, she is one of the vilest of Women. She would say something in <hi>March</hi> or <hi>May</hi> last, there is no Act proved by her.

Yes, but it is too late: But the Devil I think had possessed me, And he said he was gotten Drunk, and when a Man is Drunk he will say any thing. And, said he, I remember not a word I said: And, said he, I hope my Master will pardon me: And he said that some were promised good Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments in the Duke's Service, but none had gotten any but one, and that is the House-keeper: And he said, Better be a House-keeper in Hell.</p>

               <p>She was, and pretended to be sick; and as I was informed afterwards, she was not: For there was a Man that gave Physick, and I bad him go and look upon my Maid, and he did so, and came to me and said: Your Maid may be sullen, but she is not sick; and coming to her, I found her sullen: And afterwards I met her out of my House (said I) <hi>Jane</hi> what do you do here? She made some excuse and said, she was not well: I told her I would take Care of her: And how that they did not deserve Servants that would not take Care of them when they were Ill: I saw her muffled, and her Coats trussed up; I walked after her, and (said I) <hi>Jane</hi> whither art thou a going? and bad her let me see what she had in her Coats, and I thought it was good to have Witness: I spake to one, and (said I) Gaffer <hi>Hall</hi> come hither, do you take notice that this Linnen is all mine. A good while after, I saw this <hi>Jane Wadsworth</hi> standing at Mr. <hi>Birds</hi> (said I) she was my Servant several years ago; and my Lord, this hapned when the difference was betwixt the Duke and the Dutchess, for they said she was a grievous Witness against the Dutchess. Upon this Mr. <hi>Tobson,</hi> my Lord <hi>Peterborough's</hi> Servant sent for me. Then I came to be a Witness.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>My Lord, about the middle of <hi>December</hi> last, my Lord Duke was pleased to send for me to come to him; and so I came to Mr. <hi>Negus,</hi> and he carried me into the Duke of <hi>Norfolk's</hi> own Room. Said he, there are some Treaties betwixt me and my Wife, Sir <hi>Robert Clayton</hi> and Sir <hi>Robert Howard</hi> are concerned in them.</p>
               <p>There is one thing that I find, my Wife is setting up to have a great Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page; this I do not like. I hear (said he) she is about to have a Coach, Horses, and two or three Footmen: And this is not all, there is <hi>Castle Rising</hi> that my Wife hath a pretension to, and <hi>Billing:</hi> Now if she will part with her pretensions in them, I shall take it well, and it may be for our good, and we may be reconciled. I know <hi>Drayton</hi> is a Seat that she hath a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness for: Pray tell my Wife of it, and let her consider of it; if she be will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to comply with me in this, I shall. And (said he) I am told, if I bring a Bill of Divorce into the House of Lords, it would take effect. And so I went from the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> to the Dutchess, and told her what the Duke said: And my Lord of <hi>Peterborough</hi> hearing of it, he was angry that I went to the Duke.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir W. W.</speaker>
               <p>Did you acquaint the Dutchess, that if she would part with her pretensions in <hi>Castle Rising</hi> and <hi>Billing,</hi> all things might be reconciled.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>I did.</p>
               <p>The Bill of Divorce was lodged in the House of Lords in <hi>January</hi> following. There is one thing my Lord, that the Duke said that I had forgotten; he did speak of 2500 l. or some such thing, he could make of <hi>Castle Rising</hi> and <hi>Billing.</hi>

               <p>Do you observe what you have proved? You have proved no Lascivious Conversation; because you speak of that in the opening of the Evidence. You have not proved any Lascivious Conversation within this 6 years.</p>

               <p>The Court saith, that we have not proved the Dutchess to go beyond Sea. We will call a Witness, Mr. <hi>Negus.</hi> Pray did the Dutchess go over with the Duke? The Duke came back, did the Dutchess come with him?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Negus.</speaker>
               <p>The Dutchess came over again in 86. after that she stayed in <hi>England</hi> some time: And about the time of the Revolution, then it was given out that she was gone over again.</p>

               <p>This Cause hath been in the House of Lords. The Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whether they believed, or not believed, was not the Question; but they would have some time to make some proofs at Law.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>For, as all unlawful Conversations must have a beginning, it is necessary we should shew something of that, and the Time, and that doth fortifie the Evidence that is given within the time.</p>

               <p>Pray my Lord, if your Lordship pleases, this is the use we make in giving in Evidence some things before, to shew the Fact within the six years, their frequent meeting in a lascivious manner; and we make use of that before the 6th year, to explain what use we make of it in matters done within the six years.</p>

               <p>I do Appeal to your Lordship, and all that hear me, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther within this 6 years they have proved any Lascivious Action, or any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent Action, so that this will not Charge the Defendant: For if the Dutchess will come to his House when he is not at home, he cannot help it. All the Proof is without the 6 years, and no Proof within the 6 years to Charge him to inflict such a Crime; if they had carried it down, as to have proved Acts within this 6 years, I should have said they had done something</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Have you done?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gentlemen of the Jury,</speaker>
               <p>You understand very well the Nature of this Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the Record hath been opened to you, which was to this effect:</p>
               <p>That the Defendant the <hi>Ist</hi> day of <hi>April,</hi> in the <hi>2d</hi> year of King <hi>James,</hi> did entice away the Plaintiffs Dutchess, whereby he had not the benefir of her Society; and that he had Lascivious Conversation with her, lived in Adultery with her, and caused her to Commit Adultery.</p>
               <p>The Defendant pleaded, That he did not Commit any thing within this six years; what hath been before, is not now to be taken notice of. But the Plaintiffs Council hath given in Evidence of some Acts before, which is not for any Damage as they expect before, but to Explain some Actions that have been between them.</p>
               <p>For my part, I must declare, that these matters may be given in Evidence to Explain, but they are not to be given in Evidence to any other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
               <p>The first Witness is one <hi>Owen,</hi> and he telleth you, that he was sent to <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and he saith, That he went into the Lodgings there, and then he did see the Dutchess and <hi>Jermaine</hi> in Bed together.</p>
               <p>Then there is another Witness proves it at another time and place, that is <hi>Margaret Elwood,</hi> and she telleth you in what manner she found the Dutchess and <hi>Jermaine,</hi> and <hi>Jermaine</hi> was very Angry at her; and that his Hat and Sword lay upon the Table: And you are told by her, that looking through the Key-hole, she perceived them in Bed; she said the Curtain at the Beds-Feet was actually open, and she saw them in Bed together, and found <hi>Jermains</hi> Hankerchief and Ruffles in my Ladies Bed.</p>
               <p>The next Witness is one <hi>Ann Benskin,</hi> and she saith, They were in expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of him one Night at <hi>Windsor:</hi> They stay'd up till Two a Clock, and laid Chairs and Stools in his way, that if he came he might fall; but he did not come down that time: All this is about seven years ago, and out of the time mentioned in the Declaration. And then after, they come and begin about the year 89. and they tell you of a Lodging at <hi>Fox-hall,</hi> at one <hi>Scribers</hi> House, for a Couple of Ladies, one went by the Name of <hi>Bateman,</hi> and the other <hi>Bryan;</hi> during that time, the Man of the House knew nothing of one that went by the Name of Mr. <hi>Jermaine,</hi> but of my Ladies Brother, he had been seen walking in the Garden: They tell you, they have seen the Lady that went by the name of the Lady <hi>Bateman,</hi> and that very Lady was the Dutchess of <hi>Norfolk:</hi> And the Waterman saith, that he hath carried him often by Water, and he went by the Name of my Lady <hi>Batemans</hi> Brother; he hath carried him from the Stairs in <hi>Channel-Row</hi> to <hi>Fox-Hall,</hi> when the Lady <hi>Bateman</hi> lodged there: And hath carried Wood from <hi>Fox-Hall</hi> by the Lady <hi>Batemans</hi> order to the Cock-pit: And there is no manner of question but Mr. <hi>Jermaine</hi>'s House is at the Cock-pit: But then they come to Mrs. <hi>Wadsworth,</hi> and she is a Woman that lived next door; and she had occasion to go to <hi>Jermaine</hi>'s House for a Pint Pot; and there coming, she met with a Dutch-woman, and asked her for the Pint Pot; she saith she bad her go up stairs for it; which she did, and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49689:10"/>
then she saw the Dutchess of <hi>Norfolk</hi> undressed in a Morning-Gown; she said she very well knew her, she had seen her very many times, and she was sure this was the Dutchess of <hi>Norfolk;</hi> she telleth you, that at another time, I think it was in <hi>May</hi> last, she did see Mr. <hi>Jermaine</hi> go to the Mill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bank, she was sure it was him, and she did think he would go there, and thereupon she dodged him from that very place.</p>
               <p>She said she told one <hi>Harman</hi> that she had seen the Dutchess of <hi>Norfolk.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How, said he, if my Master had seen you, he would have killed the Dutch-woman.</p>
               <p>Then cometh one <hi>Foster</hi> the Coach-man, and saith, That about four Years since he had carried the Dutchess of <hi>Norfolk</hi> and Mr. <hi>Jermaine</hi> often times, and one time he driving them, looking back, he saw Mr. <hi>Jermaine</hi> and the Dutchess of <hi>Norfolk</hi> lying with their Heads together. Then cometh <hi>Bowtell,</hi> and he telleth you, that in <hi>April</hi> last he saw the Dutchess of <hi>Norfolk</hi> come out of <hi>Jermaine</hi>'s House in a Chair, and she was the Dutchess, and in Mans Apparel: And he said there was an old Maid had a Handbasket with some Cloaths, as he believed, she followed the Chair: And this was the Servant of the Dutchess of <hi>Norfolk.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> these are the Witnesses that prove to you, the Issue in the time mentioned.</p>
               <p>Now, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> they have called some to discredit these, they began with <hi>Jane Wadsworth;</hi> they bring one <hi>Condy</hi> that should say, that she heard <hi>Jane Wadsworth</hi> say, That she thought at the first it was the Dutchess of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> but she was mistaken: Then they call some more Witnesses, that is Mrs. <hi>Penington</hi> that was her Mistress twelve Years ago, and she said that she pretended to be sick a while after she had been with her, and so going away, she seeing her Cloaths tuck'd up, she seeing what was the matter, she had some of her Linnen; she said she lived with her not above a Fortnight and so she parted; she saith she was Indigent and Poor, and her Maid saith the same.</p>
               <p>And then they bring another Witness against one <hi>Foster</hi> the Coachman, telling him of what he had said against Mr. <hi>Jermaine,</hi> he said he was gotten Drunk, and when a Man is Drunk he will say any thing.</p>
               <p>Then as to <hi>Bowtell,</hi> whereas he saith he saw the Dutchess in Mans Apparel come out of Mr. <hi>Jermaine</hi>'s House, and the Maid was there, and the Maid cometh and saith, that she was not there, she was ill and her Leg was broke, and denieth that ever the Dutchess was there, or that she saw her in a Chair, or in Mans Appa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>
               </p>
               <p>Now for <hi>Anne <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>d,</hi> no Evidence at all is against her Testimony, and she is very positive of what was done in <hi>May</hi> last.</p>
               <p>They have called one <hi>Wellborne,</hi> who saith that the Duke sent for him, and after some other Discourse, spoke to him about <hi>Billing</hi> and <hi>Castle-Rising,</hi> and he saith the Duke sent to him, to have the Dutchess to know, if she would not Comply with him, he did not question but to prosecute a Bill of Divorce in the House of Lords with Effect. They tell indeed of <hi>Foster</hi> that <hi>Jermaine</hi> had turned him out of his Service, that he should say he would be revenged on him, but he denied that.</p>
               <p>And then the Dutchesses Letter in 87. was read: I cannot see what Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence you can make of it, but that the Duke had no design of shewing an Unkindness; you have heard the Letter read, and you may make your Inference as you will.</p>
               <p>Then as to Mrs. <hi>Wadsworth,</hi> they have brought some Persons to speak to her Reputation, and they tell you she is an Industrious Woman and of fair Conversation, and Rented a House of 60 l. <hi>per Annum;</hi> as to what they
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49689:11"/>
alledged she was kept by the Parish, no such thing, but her Husband being Sick, and about going into the Country, the Church-wardens helped him with about 16 <hi>s.</hi> That she was never in the Poors Rates, or in the Poors Books. And then as to Mrs. <hi>Penington,</hi> what she saith against her, she an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth this, that why she did live no longer with her, she saith, her Mistress kept a disorderly House.</p>
               <p>The question will be, what was betwixt the Dutchess and the Defendant within six Years; if you are satisfied that there hath been any such Lascivious Conversation. For if so be that it was only before the six Years, to what purpose was their meeting at <hi>Fox-Hall,</hi> and taking a House at <hi>Fox-Hall,</hi> and to what purpose the Dutchess came to <hi>Jermaine</hi>'s House? So that it is left to you <hi>Gentlemen</hi> to consider, if there hath been unlawful Conversation, and Lasci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Intercourse between the Dutchess and the Defendant within this six Years; if so, you are to find for the Plaintiff; but if not, you are to find for the Defendant.</p>
               <p>The next Morning the Jury brought in their Verdict into Court, and being asked whether they found for the Plaintiff or Defendant, said, for the Plaintiff.</p>
               <p>Being asked what Damages, they said One Hundred Marks Damages with Costs of Court.</p>
               <p>Upon which they had a severe Reprimand from the Court, for giving so small and Scandalous a Fine.</p>
