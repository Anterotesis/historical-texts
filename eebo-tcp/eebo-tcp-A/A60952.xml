            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Preface, p. 5. line 4. <hi>This Passage in the first Edition, which shews,</hi> That Tender Consciences are such Things as may some time or other put the Church not only to part with its Liturgy, Rites and Ceremonies, <hi>but its ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Faith also</hi> for their sake, <hi>is thus altered in the Second Edition;</hi> [which shews, That there are some such Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Consciences in the World, as (when opportunity serves) may put the <hi>Church</hi> not only to part with its <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy, Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> but its <hi>very Creed</hi> also for their sake.]</p>
            <p>Preface, p. 12. l. 26. <hi>after the words</hi> paying the Scores of both, <hi>this Discourse follows in the Second Edition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>[But now if either He himself, or any for him shall plead, That it was not fairly done to charge him with those</hi> Blasphemies,
<pb facs="tcp:29484:1" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <pb facs="tcp:29484:2"/>
               <hi>which he may (and perhaps does) pretend</hi> to have been utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Him in the Person of his Adversary, and as the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine Consequences of the Doctrine maintained by him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To this I Answer. First, That he, who pretends to speak in the</hi> Person <hi>of another, ought, according to all</hi> Justice <hi>and</hi> Decorum, <hi>to speak only such Things as that other, whom he</hi> personates, <hi>uses to speak, and consonant to his known,</hi> Avowed Sence. <hi>But did his</hi> Adversary, <hi>Dr.</hi> Owen, <hi>ever speak so? Or use the Expressions here uttered by this Author? Whereas he declares himself concerning the said Expressions thus, viz.</hi> That he cannot mention them without beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Pardon for repeating such horrid and desperate Blasphemies. Owen'<hi>s Vindication against</hi> Sherlock, <hi>p.</hi> 46. That they were fitter for a <hi>Iew,</hi> or a <hi>Mahometan,</hi> for <hi>Servetus,</hi> or <hi>Socinus,</hi> than a Son of this Church, <hi>p.</hi> 47. That he abhorred the Rehearsal of such horrid Profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, <hi>p.</hi> 49. That they were odious Satanical Exprobra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Truth of Christ's Satisfaction, <hi>ibid. And now can this Man pretend to speak these Things in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of one who thus</hi> Abhors, Abominates, <hi>and</hi> Detests <hi>them? The Truth is, his whole Book is such a lewd Misre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation both of the</hi> Words <hi>and</hi> Sence <hi>of his</hi> Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>that if he has any</hi> Bloud in his Body, <hi>it must needs</hi> fly in his Face, <hi>and bid him</hi> Blush <hi>for such</hi> Unconscionable Falsifications.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But Secondly, If he charges these Assertions as</hi> Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of the Doctrine maintained by his Adversary, <hi>I must put him in mind of these two Things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That to the just charging of any</hi> Man <hi>with the</hi> Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences <hi>of his</hi> Doctrine, <hi>or</hi> Opinion, <hi>the</hi> Things <hi>so char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, ought to be not only the</hi> Real, <hi>but also the</hi> Plain, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, <hi>and</hi> Immediate Consequences <hi>of that</hi> Opinion. <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as no Man ought in reason to be charged with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote far-fetched</hi> Consequences <hi>of any</hi> Proposition <hi>held by</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:29484:2"/>
               <hi>him; since he may in all Equity (if he disclaims them) be supposed ignorant of them, and that</hi> inculpably <hi>too.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>This</hi> Author <hi>is to know, That to the just charging of even any</hi> Doctrine, <hi>or</hi> Opinion, <hi>with such and such</hi> Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, <hi>though they follow never so</hi> really <hi>and</hi> truly <hi>from it, yet if they also lie any thing remote, and at some distance from the same, they ought first by</hi> clear undeniable Arguments <hi>to be proved to follow from thence, before they can justly and fairly be charged to do so.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Which two</hi> Observations <hi>thus premised; that I may lay the whole Matter before the</hi> Reader <hi>more particularly; he is to take Notice, That the</hi> Doctrine, <hi>which this</hi> Author <hi>loads with these</hi> Blasphemous Consequences; <hi>is,</hi> That of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of a Satisfaction to be paid to God's Justice in order to the Pardon of Sin, and the Justification of Sinners. <hi>And this I affirm to have been the</hi> received Doctrine <hi>of the</hi> Church, <hi>and the</hi> General Opinion <hi>of</hi> Divines <hi>in the Case; all asserting</hi> the Necessity of such a Satisfaction; <hi>though not All, I confess, upon the same</hi> ground.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For</hi> First, <hi>Some found this</hi> Necessity <hi>upon</hi> the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Egress of God's Vindictive Justice, <hi>naturally acting and exerting it self where it meets with a</hi> Proper Object.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But</hi> Secondly, <hi>Others state this</hi> Necessity <hi>upon the</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree <hi>or</hi> Purpose <hi>of</hi> God, <hi>resolving to take this course for the</hi> Pardon of Sin, <hi>and no other. Which</hi> Decree <hi>and</hi> Purpose, <hi>though made freely, yet being actually passed and declared, it was not free for God to baulk the execution of it. His Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity, Wisdom and Honour, as Supreme Governour of the World, not suffering him to let the Violation of his Laws pass without a due satisfaction made to his Iustice. And this has been the Opinion of most Divines in this matter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nevertheless, (whether upon either of these grounds, or some other) it is certain, that the Necessity of a Satisfaction was still</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:29484:3"/>
               <hi>held, and owned by the</hi> Church: <hi>And yet upon supposal of</hi> this Necessity <hi>alone it is, (whatsoever ground it be stated upon) that this Author sets God forth in a most Profane manner,</hi> as an Impotent Man venting his Rage and Passion without any sufficient Ground or Reason for it. <hi>For, I am sure, no other Consideration can Answer, or come up to the</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety <hi>of the forecited Expressions. And I freely appeal to the</hi> Learned, <hi>and</hi> Unbyassed Reader, <hi>Whether the said Passages can be placed to any other Account whatsoever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And if they cannot, I ask with what Conscience could this Man, of his own Head, invent such Hideous, Abominable Words, and then thrust them into his</hi> Adversary's <hi>Mouth, whether he would, or no? Or charge them as the</hi> necessary Consequences <hi>of his</hi> Doctrine, <hi>without proving, or by any formed</hi> Argument <hi>so much as offering to prove them so? For surely he ought to have done this in the first place, and (since he knew that the</hi> Learned Assertors <hi>of this</hi> Doctrine, <hi>did and would deny these to be the Consequences of it to the very Death) he should by clear and solid</hi> Ratiocination <hi>have proved against them, (in spight of their Denial) that these were indeed the</hi> True <hi>and</hi> Natural Consequences <hi>of the said</hi> Doctrine, <hi>before he reproached them as such. But, it seems he was for doing</hi> execution first, <hi>and for</hi> proceeding to Tryal afterwards; <hi>though, as hasty as he was in the former, he has not yet done the latter, nor, I believe, ever will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Upon the whole Matter it is manifest, That it was not so much any thing Personal in Dr.</hi> Owen <hi>(how bitter soever he was against him) as the</hi> Doctrine <hi>of</hi> Christ's Satisfaction <hi>asserted by the said</hi> Doctor, <hi>in common with the whole</hi> Christian Church, <hi>which this</hi> Author <hi>so vilely reflected upon; and discharged all those Blasphemous Scoffs at, in that Book of his; and consequently so far as he was the Author both of the Book and the Scoffs in it, he was as fit a Person to have joyned in the Address</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:29484:3"/>
               <hi>to the</hi> Morocco Ambassador, <hi>as any Man in</hi> England <hi>besides.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I do, I confess, charge this</hi> Author <hi>with Asserting</hi> Three Gods <hi>(though He does not</hi> in Terminis <hi>express it) because of his Asserting</hi> Three distinct Infinite Minds, <hi>or</hi> Spirits; <hi>but then the Case here on my part is quite different from what it was on his. For in this, the Consequence of</hi> Three Gods <hi>from</hi> Three distinct Infinite Spirits, <hi>is</hi> Direct, Manifest, <hi>and</hi> Immediate; <hi>or rather, in Truth, is not so properly a</hi> Consequence, <hi>or</hi> one Assertion <hi>following from</hi> another, <hi>as</hi> one <hi>and</hi> the very same <hi>thing expressed in</hi> other words, <hi>which is the true account of this Matter: For the Words</hi> [Infinite Mind, <hi>or</hi> Spirit] <hi>are but a</hi> Periphrasis <hi>of the Thing signified by the Term</hi> [God:] <hi>And their perfect equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valence shall be fully demonstrated in my</hi> Fifth Chapter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>From all which I conclude, That since there are (beyond all pretence of denial) several</hi> Horrid Blasphemous Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <hi>in this</hi> Author'<hi>s forementioned Book, which must and ought to be charged</hi> somewhere; <hi>and since his</hi> Adversary <hi>utterly disowns them all, both as to</hi> Words <hi>and</hi> Sence; <hi>and since the</hi> Doctrine <hi>it self, maintained by him, infers no such Thing, nor has this</hi> Author <hi>proved that it does so; but that the said Representations of it are peculiarly his own, and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur no where but in his Book (except possibly in the Writings of some of his old Friends the</hi> Socinians, <hi>and those such as the</hi> Transilvanian Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters) <hi>it follows, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording</hi>

            <p>Secondly, I must remind him also, That the word <hi>Plainer</hi> in the <hi>Comparative Degree,</hi> does not couch under it the positive signification of <hi>Plain,</hi> &amp;c. And much less <hi>very plain and easie:</hi> [Nay, so very plain as to have <hi>all the difficulties of it solved,</hi> as this Author has expresly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed]. So that if this be a <hi>Scandalous Imputation,</hi> it is easie to see to <hi>whom the Scandal of it must belong,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

            <p>[But there is an extraordinary Passage in his Book of Judgment, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 164. of the last Edition, (which should be the most correct) and I was doubting, whether I should charge it upon his Ignorance, or his Insolence; but both of them play their Parts very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably in it. For first he makes a most false, illite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and absurd Translation of a Verse, or rather part of a Verse in the New Testament, and then reproaches the received Translation as wrong, and very faulty, for rendring it otherwise. The place is in 2 <hi>Pet. c.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 4. <gap reason="foreign">

only the words <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, dividing them from the rest of the Sentence, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and by that means from the <hi>Verb</hi> in this <hi>latter</hi> part of it, which should govern the <hi>Noun</hi> in the <hi>former;</hi> thereby making <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to be governed not by <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (as it ought to be) but most falsely and Ungrammatically by <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and so he renders <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>casting them,</hi> viz. the Apostate Angels, <hi>down into Chains of darkness.</hi> And this interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation he builds partly upon the pretended Reason of the Thing here discoursed of, and partly upon the significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, but upon both of them very absurdly. From the Reason of the Thing he argues, that if <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> should signifie the Apostate Angels <hi>being cast down into Hell,</hi> how could they be said upon Sentence passed upon them at the last Judgment, to be then cast into Hell, if they were there before? To which the Answer is very easie and obvious, That im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately upon their sin they were cast down into, and kept in those lower Regions called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <hi>Hell lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally,</hi> but not cast into <hi>Hell-Torments,</hi> till the last Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment has passed upon them; so that with full accord both to Scripture and Reason we are to distinguish the <hi>place of Hell,</hi> where they now are, from the <hi>Iudicial pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Torments of Hell,</hi> which they shall be adjudged to, and endure in that place hereafter; as we distinguish the Prison wherein Malefactors are kept, from the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution which they are there kept for; As indeed this Text with great significance alludes to both: So that his Argument from hence falls to nothing. His other Reason is from the signification of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which he affirms to signifie <hi>only to cast down.</hi> But on the contrary, I must here tell him first, That <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> does not only import the Act of casting down, but (being
<pb facs="tcp:29484:5"/>
derived from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) signifies also the Term <hi>ad quem,</hi> or the Place, into which this casting down is. And I refer him to all the <hi>Greek</hi> Lexicographers (not one of them excepted) whether they do not render <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> by <hi>in Tartarum detrudo, dejicio,</hi> or <hi>praecipito;</hi> and if so, how can <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> possibly here agree with <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; for if <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> be the Term <hi>ad quem</hi> of the Act, how can <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> be so too; since one single Act can have but one Ultimate Term <hi>ad quem?</hi> And even this Man himself does not allow <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to be one and the same thing. And besides this, I must tell him further, That if <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> imported the <hi>Term, Thing,</hi> or <hi>Place,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which God cast down the Apostate Angels, it ought not to have been <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as the motion of casting down, importing a <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal descent</hi> to something, the Dative Case cannot in true Grammar answer it.</p>
            <p>And therefore the old <hi>Latine</hi> Version makes <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to import, not the <hi>Term</hi> to which, but the Instruments or means by which these Angels were thus brought down, rendring the Text thus, <hi>Rudentibus Inferni detractos in Tartarum tradidit,</hi> &amp;c. which, as it is not strictly a <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation,</hi> but an arbitrary <hi>Paraphrase,</hi> so it is a very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and unnatural one too; as importing not a <hi>casting</hi> but a <hi>drawing down these Angels into Hell.</hi> In which case, who must be the Person drawing them? For since God (to whom <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> does and must here agree) ought to be considered by us as in the Highest Heaven, how can this drawing <hi>down</hi> be applied to him, which, in the Nature of it, supposes the Person <hi>drawing</hi> to be in that lower place, to which he is drawing others? For all <hi>Traction</hi> is a motion of the Agent forcibly bringing some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to himself, but <hi>Trusion</hi> a motion by which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves or forces something from himself.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:29484:6"/>
It is clear therefore, that according to all the Rules of Grammatical Construction, and proper speaking, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> cannot be governed by <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and that, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore something else must be sought for to govern it, which can be nothing besides <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. And then the whole Sentence will be properly and plainly transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thus. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> [God] <hi>having cast or thrust them</hi> [viz. <hi>the Apostate Angels] down into Hell</hi> [or the <hi>Lower Regions</hi>] <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>kept,</hi> or <hi>reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to</hi> [or <hi>for] Iudgment.</hi> And this is sence and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of Speech, agreeable both to the Natural Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and the Grammatical Syntax of the Words. But the Translation so imperiously and ignorantly given by this Man (in correction of that of the Church) is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to neither. For it both divides one part of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence from the other, from which it must not be divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and then makes <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to be governed by <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which cannot govern it, and quite cutts it off from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which alone can.</p>
            <p>And now, ought it not to be matter of Amazement to all Men of Sense and Sobriety, to see a Puny, who is not able to master three words of <hi>Greek,</hi> presume to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul such great Masters of that Language, as the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slators of the New Testament into <hi>English</hi> undoubtedly were? Nay, and thereby to reflect upon the Church her self, which has received and owned this Translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to whose Judgment and Authority (if he be so nearly related to her, as he pretends) he ows so great and <hi>filial</hi> a Deference? Let him rather instead of corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the <hi>English</hi> Translation (a Work which he was never born for) thank God, and the Translators for it; there being few Men living more beholden to it than himself. And therefore leaving his forlorn Criticisme

(as new every whit as his Divinity) to shift for it self; I, for my part, like my <hi>English</hi> Bible, for his dislike of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny part of it, better than before. For I can by no means see any force or consequence in this Argument, <hi>viz.</hi> That because this Author is much better at <hi>quoting</hi> a <hi>Greek</hi> Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence than at <hi>construing</hi> it; therefore the <hi>English</hi> Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation of this Text in St. <hi>Peter</hi> is a <hi>very bad Translation:</hi> I say, I cannot admit, or yield to this Consequence.]</p>

            <p>Now all these <hi>Errata,</hi> one would think, make up a jolly <hi>Company</hi> to rendezvous together in the compass of less than half a dozen Pages of an <hi>English</hi> Book; a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany fit for our Author to march Triumphantly in the Head of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Page</hi> 360. After [William Giles some time of <hi>Mark-Lane</hi>] in the First Edition in the Margin, is added in the Margin of the Second [<hi>who Wrote (forsooth) in defence of our Author against the</hi> Papists.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Page</hi> 374. <hi>Lines</hi> 12, 13, 14. That Passage [<hi>It is much fitter to be Censured by a Convocation, though even He Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self should be Prolocutor of it</hi>] is altered in <hi>Page</hi> 377. <hi>Line</hi> 9. thus— [<hi>[Though even He Himself (since</hi> John Goodwin <hi>and</hi> Hugh Peters <hi>are gone off) should be Prolocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of it.</hi>]</p>
            <p>And now, upon the issue of the whole Matter, I hope all Ingenuous, and Impartial Readers, all True Friends of our <hi>English,</hi> Church and Old Divinity will allow, that I have treated an Insolent, Imposing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novator, no otherwise than he has deserved; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indeed much short of it; and that None will Tax, or Censure me for what I have Wrote, but such as can think it reasonable for one Man to Tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple upon, and Insult over his whole Profession, and to be Applauded, or at least endured in such a Presumption.
<pb facs="tcp:29484:8"/>
For my own part, I can by no means judge so; and as I abhor such Pride in others; so, I hope, I shall never be guilty of the least degree of it my self. I thank God, I account not the meanest of my own Profession my Inferiour; and if I should be tempted to think any one <hi>Below</hi> me, it should be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly such an one as thinks himself <hi>Above</hi> all the World besides.</p>
