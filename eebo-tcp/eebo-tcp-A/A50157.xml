            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Ensuing Sermon, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
in a Neighbour-Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
under Afflicting impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
from the <hi>sudden Death</hi> of an <hi>only
Child,</hi> with a bestowal of some Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
and Enlargement since upon it;
I know no fitter Person than Your self,
to Present unto; <hi>Your Self,</hi> I say, Who
have had several <hi>Infants</hi> carried hence
unto the <hi>Father of Spirits,</hi> in the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot
of the same Distemper that fetched
mine away. <hi>Books</hi> or <hi>Thoughts</hi> on
such a Subject as that which is handled

made a <hi>Mourner</hi> my self, I thought it
a fit occasion for me, to <hi>Write</hi> as well
as <hi>Think</hi> more particularly, the things
that may be serviceable to the sorrowful.
Nor have I many Friends in this Evil
World, whose Edification I can pursue
with more <hi>Alacrity</hi> and <hi>Activity,</hi> by
such pains as these, than Yours. I have
often felt the <hi>Power,</hi> and almost as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
the <hi>Sweetness</hi> of that perswasion,
<hi>My God will never hurt me.</hi> Vnto
Your self, that I may recommend the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment

as you have been call'd unto the Resignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

in his Funeral Oration on the
Death of his Brother, giving this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of his Aged and then Living Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents;
<hi>My Father and Mother,</hi> (says
he) <hi>who are both Lovers of their
Children, but more Lovers of their
Saviour, after they had in spite of all
<pb facs="tcp:36303:3"/>
the Moths, and all the Thieves, and
all the Devils too in this World, laid
up in a better World, a Rich Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
for their Children, they have
now sent one of their Sons before, to
take Possession of it.</hi> If your Modesty
and Humility will not permit me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
this as a <hi>Charecter</hi> of, let me how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
propound it as an <hi>Employment</hi> for
Your self, and your Virtuous Consort.
You cannot use too much care to secure
unto your <hi>Children</hi> an <hi>Inheritance
among the Saints in Light;</hi> and for
those which are departed, you may be joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
assured, That they are made <hi>parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
of that Inheritance.</hi> What fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
possession of this Waste Wild <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi>
the Lord Iesus may take yet before
the Time <hi>of the Restitution of all
things,</hi> we cannot <hi>Positively say;</hi> only
we may <hi>probably hope,</hi> that he has a
Glorious Interest shortly to be erected
and maintained in these <hi>utmost parts
of the Earth.</hi> But this I am sure of,
There are some <hi>rich plots</hi> of Ground in
this Continent, which in the Approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Day of God will yield no small
<hi>Sheaves</hi> of pure <hi>Grain</hi> unto the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty

Age has produced in these Western <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi>
those <hi>Dormitories,</hi> which are fill'd
with precious <hi>Dust,</hi> united unto the Son of
God. Part of that Honour able <hi>Dust</hi> hath
proceeded from your happy Loins; Your
deceased <hi>Children</hi> are part of the <hi>Turf,</hi>
with which the Lord Iesus, as it were,
takes a <hi>Livery</hi> and <hi>Seisin</hi> of this New
World for himself. Sir, Be encouraged
to go on, <hi>abounding in the Work of
the Lord;</hi> and go on, to believe it your
Felicity, That you shall <hi>go to your

               <bibl>Gen. XLII. 36.</bibl>
               <q>Me have ye bereaved of my CHILDREN;

            <p>THE common, but causeless <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake</hi>
of Pious Men, <hi>under</hi> and
<hi>about</hi> Afflictions, is represented
in these Words; of which words
the venerable <hi>Chrysostom</hi> in his Ancient
Commentary on them, speaks truly, <hi>They
are fit words to express the Relenting Bowels of
a Parent;</hi> and yet we may without ill man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
venture to add, <hi>The words do not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:36303:5"/>
so well become the Grace, the Faith, the
Patience of a Christian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this Book of the <hi>Worlds Beginning,</hi>
which contains an admirable Narrative of
Transactions for above Three and twenty
Hundred Years from the first Dawn of
<hi>Time;</hi> the Revolutions which went over
the Patriarch <hi>Iacob,</hi> are not the least spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of by <hi>Moses,</hi> the Inspired Historian;
and there are especially Three Travels of
that renowned Man, which the <hi>History of
his Life and Death</hi> is Elegantly woven into:
The last of those Journies was of near
Two hundred Miles, namely from <hi>Canaan</hi>
unto <hi>Goshen,</hi> occasioned by his Son <hi>Ioseph</hi>'s
Advancement to be <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and
the Relief which that Honourable <hi>Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Roy</hi>
had provided against the sore Famine
then raging in the Countries round about.</p>
            <p>This Chapter entertains us with a very
affecting story of some accidents prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
thereunto; a story, <hi>How</hi> the Ten
Brethren of <hi>Ioseph,</hi> by whose Villany he
had been Spirited away into <hi>Egypt,</hi> made
their <hi>Humble Address</hi> unto him for <hi>Corn,</hi>
while his Grandure and his Policy conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him from their knowledge: <hi>How</hi> by a
contrivance he made one of them, <hi>Simeon</hi> by
name, a <hi>Prisoner;</hi> in the mean time ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:36303:5"/>
the rest to return with another Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of his, by name <hi>Benjamin,</hi> who was by
them left behind as the chief solace of
their Aged <hi>Father,</hi> and the only remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Child of his deceased <hi>Mother.</hi> Old
<hi>Iacob</hi> was made acquainted with the true
state of the Case, and in this Verse we
have his grievous Resentment of it. In
this Querimonious Lamentation of the
good old Saint there are especially Two
things intimated:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Here seems to be a <hi>Suspecting</hi> of
his Childrens <hi>Wickedness;</hi> his words are,
<hi>Me have ye bereaved of my Children,</hi> Joseph
<hi>is not,</hi> Simeon <hi>is not, and ye will take</hi> Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin
<hi>away.</hi> Methinks the sorrow of his
oppressed Heart seems thus to vent it
self, <hi>q. d.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>This is a strange, and a very sad
thing; I cannot trust you <hi>all</hi> together,
but <hi>one</hi> or other of you, that you think
I have a particular kindness for, must
come short home. I am now confirmed
in my doubts, that <hi>you</hi> were the <hi>Wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beasts,</hi>
the unnatural <hi>Tygres</hi> who tore
my <hi>Ioseph</hi> to pieces. I am not without
my <hi>Fears,</hi> that you are the <hi>Iaylors,</hi> Shall
I say? or the <hi>Hangmen</hi> who have got my
<hi>Simeon</hi> out of the way. And I am jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:36303:6"/>
that you have some ill design upon
my best Darling <hi>Benjamin</hi> too. Never
had any man such mishaps in his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
as your miserable Father has.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Next,</hi> Here seems to be a <hi>Bewailing</hi> of
his Makers <hi>providence:</hi> His words are, <hi>All
these things are against me.</hi> Some render
them, <hi>All these things are</hi> UPON <hi>me,</hi> q. d.
<q>As for <hi>you,</hi> you make light of these mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
as if they were no concernment of
<hi>yours:</hi> For <hi>my</hi> part, I feel them, they
go very near to <hi>me.</hi>
               </q> But our Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it, seems more worthy of Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
and Acceptation; <hi>All these things
are</hi> AGAINST <hi>me:</hi> And then this Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrase
will carry the sence of it, <hi>q. d.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The things which have been my <hi>Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
will be my <hi>Ruine;</hi> they are a sort
of things which I cannot conceive any
advantage to my self <hi>consulted</hi> in, or
<hi>accruing</hi> by. When I look upon the
<hi>dealings</hi> of the Lord, I cannot but be
full of awful Apprehensions that I am
utterly banished from the <hi>mercies</hi> of the
Lord; these things render me an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
Man.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Now, remember that the happy event
proved him egregiously <hi>mistaken</hi> here; <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph
is not,</hi> said he; yet, <hi>he was,</hi> and his
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:36303:6"/>
Father had no cause to be sorry that he
was <hi>what he was: Simeon is not,</hi> said he;
yet <hi>he was,</hi> and his Father might have been
starved, if he had not been <hi>where he was.</hi>
Those things which he so fondly counted
<hi>against him,</hi> were the very things that not
only try'd his <hi>Grace,</hi> but also sav'd his
<hi>Life.</hi> Let us admit the deplored <hi>Child</hi>
himself, to correct the sad <hi>mistake;</hi> he
said afterwards in <hi>Gen. 50. 20. God meant

                  <p>The <hi>Christian</hi> that promises himself an

                  <argument>
                     <p>The people of God are apt very frequently to
conclude, that the Afflictive Dispensations

highly to their prejudice.</p>

                  <p>From the embittered Heart of a <hi>Iacob</hi>
in his exercises, there is often sob'd that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:36303:9"/>
melancholy Groan, <hi>All these things are
against me.</hi> Alas! under Affliction we can
usually speak no other Language but that
in <hi>Lam. 3. 1. I have seen Affliction by the

<hi>Wrath</hi> and <hi>Curse,</hi> and fiery Vengeance dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensed

                  <div type="question">
                     <head>Question.</head>
                     <head type="sub">Whence do's this come to pass?</head>
                     <p>One reason of this <hi>Misprision</hi> is; The
best people of God are not without bad
<hi>remainders of Flesh:</hi> Now every <hi>Affliction</hi>
will grate hard upon <hi>That;</hi> the galled <hi>Flesh</hi>
of Afflicted Men, cannot forbear that
shreek, <hi>I am hurt.</hi> This <hi>Flesh</hi> of ours will
cloud our understandings, and beget in us
very <hi>false Conceptions</hi> of our <hi>sharp Afflictions.</hi>
The methods wherein the great God pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sues
our good, are very <hi>Certain,</hi> and very
<hi>Glorious;</hi> but they are also very <hi>Obscure.</hi>
Silly shallow Creatures, who <hi>dwell in Houses
of Clay,</hi> cannot fathom the Mysterious
proceedings of the God whose <hi>Way is in the
Deep,</hi> and whose <hi>Iudgments are a great Deep;</hi>
and when we go to Contemplate these
<hi>deep things,</hi> then our <hi>Flesh</hi> offers unto us
very injurious Glasses to view them in;
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:36303:10"/>
listen to this misjudging <hi>Flesh,</hi> and it will
tell us, <hi>If thou dost not live surrounded with
the Pleasures, and Riches, and Honours of this
World, and leave a good Portion of them unto
Children of thy own; when thy time shall come
to Dye, thou art a Miserable Man.</hi> The
moan of <hi>Iacob</hi> in our Text is by some
Englished so, <hi>All these things are Above me:</hi>
Truly, 'tis <hi>above</hi> the Reach, <hi>above</hi> the ken
of our <hi>Flesh</hi> to imagine, <hi>That what impairs
our Worldly greatness and glory, is no real
Detriment unto us;</hi> our <hi>Sense,</hi> our carnal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
dim-sighted <hi>Sense,</hi> will not easily
make <hi>sence</hi> of that Riddle, in <hi>Iudg. 14. 14.
Out of the Eater came forth Meat.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Another reason of this <hi>Error</hi> is; The
people of God have been guilty of much
<hi>Sin against God.</hi> In the dark doleful days
of their Unregeneracy, how many, how
mighty, were our <hi>doings against the Lord!</hi>
Yea, and since the Lord made us <hi>know wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
in the hidden Man;</hi> how crooked, how
faulty have our ways before him been!
The Psalmist complained in <hi>Psal. 49. 5.
In the days of Evil, the iniquity of my heels
doth compass me about:</hi> Our <hi>Heels</hi> formerly
have step'd awry into dirty <hi>Iniquities,</hi> and
those <hi>Iniquities</hi> we have been ready to lay
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:36303:10"/>
at our <hi>Heels</hi> by our Impenitent forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
But in our <hi>Afflictions</hi> those <hi>Iniquities</hi>
rising as it were out of their Grave, haunt
us, dog us, and stare us full in the Face;
our Hearts now <hi>condemn</hi> us, and thereupon
they likewise <hi>condemn God:</hi> We are prone
to think that <hi>Gods designs</hi> cannot be good,
because we know that <hi>our deserts</hi> are very
bad. Sinful Man will not quickly believe
that word of the Lord, <hi>My Thoughts are
not as your Thoughts:</hi> Hence our own first
<hi>misgiving,</hi> and then <hi>misjudging</hi> Hearts will
in Affliction say, <hi>Now I feel the wounds of
an Enemy: It is not possible that I should suffer
these terrible things from one who is the God
of my Salvation; the Lord proceeds to Afflict
me thus, because he intends to destroy me for
ever.</hi> When once a thinking Man comes
to say, <hi>God is Angry,</hi> he will soon add, <hi>I
am undone.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A Third reason (to say no more) of it,
is; The <hi>Devil of Hell</hi> often falls upon the
people of God in their Afflictions, that
soul Fiend falls foul on them, when he has
them thus at a <hi>disadvantage.</hi> The <hi>Powers
of Darkness</hi> take the <hi>Hours of Darkness</hi>
therein to make their Assaults on the Faith
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:36303:11"/>
of them that they would annoy. The
<hi>Accuser of Men</hi> to God, is also an <hi>Accuser
of God</hi> to Men; and when it is a Gloomy
time without them, then will Satan sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
within them, <hi>Terribilia de Deo,</hi> very
frightful Visions of their Almighty Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour;
he will pour in upon them those
things which are call'd, in <hi>Eph. 6. 16. The
fiery Darts of the Wicked one:</hi> He would
have us entertain <hi>hard</hi> and <hi>Hellish thoughts</hi>
of that God, <hi>whose Mercy endureth for
Ever:</hi> Hence he will be still telling of us,
<hi>God counts thee for his Enemy,</hi> and <hi>thy God
hath forgotten thee,</hi> and <hi>the Mercy of the
Lord is clean gone from thee for ever; thou
art before thy Maker as a Vessel wherein he will
have no pleasure for evermore; he will undo
thee before he has done with thee.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now, What is the Result of all this?
Alas! the people of God now frequently
have cause to give that mean, that shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
that pitiful account of themselves,
in <hi>Psal. 77. 2. In the day of my trouble, my
Soul refused to be comforted.</hi>

                  <argument>
                     <p>The people of God conclude not a little wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,

if these things had not happened.</hi> When the

Vndone!</hi> they have cause to eat that word,
and rather to say, <hi>Periissem nisi periissem,</hi> I
had been <hi>quite undone,</hi> if I had not been
<hi>thus undone.</hi> Instead of concluding, <hi>All

<hi>wrong,</hi> if we do not admit that <hi>Thought,</hi>
in <hi>Rom. 8. 28. All things shall work together

                     <head type="sub">How do's this Appear?</head>
                     <p>One piece of <hi>Injustice</hi> attending of that
conclusion is; There is a <hi>wrong</hi> thereby
done to the <hi>Kindness</hi> of God. With such
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:36303:12"/>
a clap of Thunder as this may the Lord
reprove your hard opinion of him, <hi>You
think worse of me than I deserve!</hi> Our good
God hath assured us, in <hi>Rev. 3. 19. Whom
I love, I rebuke and chasten;</hi> why then shall
we contradict him with such a vain imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
as this, <hi>I am Rebuked only that I may
be ruined, I am Chastened only because I am
abhorred by the Lord?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Another <hi>Injustice</hi> expressed in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
is; There is thereby a <hi>wrong</hi> done
to the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of God. They of Old re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected
hard, when they said, <hi>Can any good
thing come out of Nazareth?</hi> Thus do they
that say, <hi>Can any good thing come out of
Affliction?</hi> Well, and I pray, Why not?
What should hinder <hi>Good</hi> from coming
out of that <hi>grievous thing?</hi> Is it impossible
unto that God, who is <hi>wise in Counsel, and
wonderful in Working?</hi> We are informed in
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 6. It is only <hi>if need be,</hi> that we
are brought into <hi>Heaviness:</hi> The Lord
would not let one <hi>Affliction</hi> give thee any
Trouble, if some <hi>Occasion</hi> did not call for
it, if much <hi>Advantage</hi> did not come by it.</p>
                     <p>One more Evidence of <hi>Vnreasonableness</hi>
in this conclusion is, The people of God
at the Period of their <hi>Afflictions,</hi> will them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
confess, this conclusion to have
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:36303:12"/>
been <hi>Vnreasonable.</hi> What our Lord said
unto the Inquisitive <hi>Peter,</hi> the same he
says unto the <hi>Afflicted</hi> Christian, <hi>What I
do, thou knowest not now, but thou shalt know
hereafter:</hi> Verily, when we do <hi>hereafter
know,</hi> how God has at once <hi>Afflicted</hi> us and
<hi>Amended</hi> us, then we shall say, <hi>He hath
done all things well.</hi> When we have got
through the <hi>black Vallies,</hi> out on the other
side, then we shall <hi>see</hi> what now we will
hardly <hi>believe,</hi> then we see that the
<hi>Thoughts</hi> of God about us were <hi>Thoughts
of Good and not of Evil;</hi> then we see that
the <hi>Aims</hi> of God were to <hi>do us Good in the
latter end;</hi> then do our Triumphing Souls
declare as in <hi>Psal. 119. 71. It is good for
me, that I have been Afflicted.</hi> Nothing is
more common than to hear a Christian
after many <hi>Afflictions</hi> professing, <hi>I could not
have been well without any one of all my Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions,
I had want of them all, I have good
by them all:</hi> How much more will the
Beauty and Benefit of all our Afflictions
be thankfully acknowledged by us in the
Land of <hi>light,</hi> where every <hi>Labyrinth</hi> of
<hi>providence</hi> will be explained; for every
one of our <hi>Afflictions</hi> in this, we shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn

                  <head>The General Case.</head>
                  <p>The more <hi>General Exhortation</hi> to be
now Urged, is;</p>
                  <p>Let us under no Affliction whatsoever, be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>composed
with any Apprehension, as if it
were utterly Against us.</p>
                  <p>I am speaking to many <hi>Children of Iacob</hi>
that are <hi>Children of Affliction;</hi> some of us
are lamenting over our broken <hi>Estates,</hi>
like <hi>Naomi,</hi> in <hi>Ruth</hi> 1. 21. saying, <hi>I was
Full, but I am become Empty.</hi> Some of us
are Lamenting over our blasted <hi>Credits,</hi>
like <hi>David,</hi> in <hi>Psal.</hi> 69. 20. saying, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:36303:14"/>
hath broken my Heart;</hi> and there are
with us those who are Weeping over their
Dead <hi>Children,</hi> like the distressed Women
of <hi>Bethlehom,</hi> in <hi>Matth. 2. 18. Weeping for
their Children, and not willing to be comforted,
because they are not:</hi> And many more such
Griefs are the minds of devout Persons
among us Wounded with. That which
<hi>Iacob</hi> sigh'd over his <hi>Ioseph</hi> and <hi>Simeon,</hi> is by
multitudes Mourned over their other En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments
also. An <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> as in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 24. 16.
Sighs over the <hi>Desire</hi> of his Eyes, <hi>She is
not!</hi> A Widow of one of the Sons of
the Prophets, as in 2 <hi>King</hi> 4. 1. Sighs,
<hi>My Husband is not.</hi> An <hi>Isaac,</hi> as in <hi>Gen.</hi>
24. 67. may Sigh over his <hi>Mother, She is
not.</hi> An <hi>Israel,</hi> as in <hi>Gen.</hi> 35. 29. may
Sigh over his <hi>Father, He is not.</hi> And if a
<hi>Ionah</hi> have had any <hi>Gourd</hi> which he has
taken much contentment in, he too, as in
<hi>Ion.</hi> 4. 8. is made to Sigh, <hi>It is not.</hi> But
that which puts a <hi>Sting</hi> into all these Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions,
is, that the Afflicted say, <hi>All these
things are against me.</hi> Now, O that there
may be laid upon the thus talking <hi>Sorrow</hi> a
charge of <hi>Silence;</hi> Eternal <hi>Silence</hi> unto thee
now, O thou inordinate <hi>Passion,</hi> before the
Lord. Let this be as a <hi>Word upon the Wheels,</hi>
running into the very Souls of them that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:36303:14"/>
are of an <hi>heavy Heart.</hi> Be entreated, O
Afflicted Christians, to say no more, <hi>All
these things are against me.</hi> No, be Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted;
be Refreshed with Sentiments that
are quite contrary thereunto. In your
most cloudy hours, O strive to say with
him in <hi>Psal. 94. 19. In the multitude of my
Thoughts within me,</hi> O Lord, <hi>thy comforts
delight my Soul.</hi>

Now there are these comfortable things,
which it is fit for you to <hi>consider</hi> in this day

Even in <hi>outward Respects,</hi> you canot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
what is best for you: It were as
much <hi>Arrogance</hi> in <hi>you</hi> to <hi>direct</hi> the <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
of God, as it was <hi>Blasphemy</hi> in the
well-known Prince to <hi>Correct</hi> the <hi>Creation</hi>
of God, when he said, <hi>Had I been by at the

some things might have been better done.</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
you are Afflicted, because your <hi>Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions</hi>

you not read in <hi>Eccl.</hi> 5. 13. of <hi>Riches kept
to the hurt of the Owners:</hi> Many a Mans

him his <hi>Head,</hi> by his <hi>Land</hi> he has forfeited
his <hi>Life;</hi> the poor Heathen of old, <hi>cursing</hi>
of his Enemy, wished that he might be
a <hi>Rich man.</hi> Perhaps you are Afflicted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of a little Mud thrown upon your
<hi>Reputations;</hi> but have you not read in
<hi>Prov.</hi> 27. 14. How pernicious a thing it
is to have too much <hi>Applause</hi> in the World?
To be too well spoken of, procures that
<hi>Envy,</hi> before which, <hi>Who can stand?</hi> The
<hi>Breath</hi> in the Trumpet of <hi>Fame</hi> not rarely
carries a <hi>Plague,</hi> and a <hi>Bane</hi> to them
whose <hi>Names</hi> it founds. It may be, your
<hi>Affliction</hi> is the loss of <hi>Children;</hi> well, have
you not read such a Message sent to a godly
Man, as that in 1 <hi>Sam. 2. 33. The Son of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:36303:15"/>
thine, whom I shall not cut off, shall be to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
thine Eyes, and to grieve thine Heart.</hi>
Tis possible, that if thy Child had liv'd,
it might have made thee, <hi>the Father of a
Fool,</hi> or (that I may speak to the Sex that
is most unable to bear this Trial) <hi>the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of a Shame.</hi> It is a very ordinary
thing for <hi>one Living Child</hi> to occasion more
trouble than <hi>seven Dead ones.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>However, in <hi>Spiritual Regards,</hi> you may
be exceedingly harmed by the <hi>secular De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights</hi>
which you desire; you may have
cause to <hi>Rue</hi> what you <hi>Wish,</hi> because it
may prove an <hi>Idol</hi> which will render your
Souls like the <hi>Barren Heath in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
before the Lord.</hi> We do very Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishly
often cry for a <hi>Knife</hi> that would cut
the Fingers of our own Souls; we pant after
those things which may be to our Souls as
bad as <hi>drink</hi> to the Thirsty craving Man
in a Dropsie. It was the very direful ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity
of the ancient <hi>Israelites,</hi> in <hi>Psal. 105.
15. The Lord gave them their Requests, but
sent leanness into their Soul.</hi> A <hi>Lean</hi> Soul, a
<hi>Wretched</hi> Soul, a Soul <hi>pining away in its ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities,</hi>
is oftentimes the effect of those
fine things which we Dote upon. It is a
blasted banned <hi>Soul</hi> that sets up a Creature
in the Room, the Throne of the great
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:36303:16"/>
God, that gives unto a Creature those
<hi>Loves</hi> and those <hi>Cares</hi> which are due unto
the great God alone: Such <hi>Idolatry</hi> the
<hi>Soul</hi> is too frequently by <hi>Prosperity</hi> seduc'd
unto. We are told in <hi>Prov. 1. 32. The
prosperity of Fools destroys them;</hi> many a

hear of What:</p>
                        <p>§. The Lord resolves to make you <hi>know</hi>
more, <hi>First</hi> of HIMSELF: We have
been miserably deficient in the <hi>knowledge of
God,</hi> (we may say of our selves, as <hi>Paul</hi>
of some) we may <hi>speak it unto our shame;</hi>
Our <hi>Ignorance</hi> of God hath been the cause
of ours <hi>Sins;</hi>
                           <q>Heu! Prima haec scelerum causa est mortalibus aegris
Naturam nescire Dei—</q>
And our <hi>Knowledge</hi> of God will be the
effect of our <hi>Sorrows</hi> for them: The Lord
is carrying of you into the Clifts of a crag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
Rock, and it is to make the <hi>Glory</hi> of
his Attributes pass before you. When
<hi>Iob</hi> had gone through his <hi>weary Months,</hi>
                           <pb n="27" facs="tcp:36303:17"/>
he then said unto the Lord, as in <hi>Iob. 42.
5. Now mine Eye sees thee!</hi> It is by <hi>Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
that we are brought to see the <hi>Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
of God, and to lie before him as <hi>Clay in
the Hand of the Potter;</hi> to see the <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness</hi>
of God, and to own that he <hi>punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
us far less than our iniquities deserve;</hi> to
see the <hi>Holiness</hi> of God, and to Reverence
him as one that is of <hi>purer Eyes than to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
Evil;</hi> to see the <hi>Power</hi> of God, and to
think, that <hi>nothing is too hard for the Lord;</hi>
to see the <hi>Goodness</hi> of God, and to find
him a <hi>rewarder of them that diligently seek</hi>
him; in a word, a little more <hi>Affliction</hi>
will bring thee to say, <hi>Lord, I know thy
Name, and I will put my Trust in thee.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>§. The Lord resolves to make you <hi>know</hi>
more, <hi>Secondly,</hi> of his SON: What are
all those <hi>Afflictions</hi> that make you groan?
Truly, they are a few <hi>Chips</hi> and <hi>Splinters</hi>
of a Redeemers <hi>Cross:</hi> They are, as 'tis said,
in <hi>Col. 1. 24. That which is behind of the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
of Christ;</hi> some <hi>Vinegar</hi> and <hi>Gall</hi>
was left by him for us to <hi>pledge</hi> him by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
of: God will thereby make you sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
a little of the <hi>Agonies</hi> and <hi>Anguishes</hi>
that made him to Roar, when there were
<hi>Laid on him the Iniquities of us all.</hi> We
were never yet enough affected with the
<hi>Kindness</hi> of our Lord Jesus in the dark
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:36303:18"/>
doleful day, when he <hi>endured the Cross, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spising
the Shame</hi> which was due unto us all.
Art thou <hi>Poor?</hi> God will have thee call to
mind the <hi>Poverty</hi> which thy Redeemer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent
for thy sake, the <hi>Poverty</hi> which
when our Lord <hi>Inventoried</hi> his Estate, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
the <hi>Sum Total</hi> of it only this, <hi>The Son
of Man hath not where to lay his Head.</hi> Art
thou <hi>Pained?</hi> God will have thee mindful
of the <hi>strong Pains</hi> which thy Redeemer
felt, when his <hi>Flesh</hi> was torn from his
Bones, when from Head to Foot bloody
Wounds and Stripes and Stabs were to be
seen upon him. Art thou <hi>Fearful?</hi> God
will have thee bear in mind, the horrible
Consternation which caused thy Redeemer
to Sweat clots of <hi>Blood,</hi> tho' in a cold
Night he were groveling on the cold
Ground. Art thou <hi>Disgraced?</hi> God will
have thee mindful of the Ignominy cast up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thy Saviour, when he was used as a
<hi>Traytor,</hi> as all that was Vile, and when the
basest fellow in the City was counted a
better Man than he. Do thy <hi>Friends</hi> deal
unworthily? Thou shalt then learn what
the Exercise of thy Redeemer was, when
even those of his own Family, <hi>all forsook
him and fled:</hi> these things <hi>Affliction</hi> will
make us <hi>Thoughtful</hi> of, and <hi>Thankful</hi> for: And
as the <hi>Kindness</hi> of a <hi>Iesus,</hi> so the <hi>Value</hi> of a
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:36303:18"/>
                           <hi>Iesus,</hi> comes to be duly rated by such means
as these. The <hi>Afflicted</hi> man is driven to
call every <hi>Creature, A lying Vanity,</hi> and from
hence he comes to call a <hi>Christ, The Pearl
of great Price:</hi> It hath been said, <hi>Vnto you
that are Believers he is Precious;</hi> we may add,
<hi>He is Precious to you that are Afflicted</hi> also.
The Afflicted man finds that <hi>Gold</hi> it self
will do him no good; whereupon a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
becomes more desirable than whole
Mountains of <hi>Ophirs Gold</hi> unto him.</p>
                        <p>§. The Lord resolves to make you <hi>know</hi>
more, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Of his WORD. There is
a Glorious <hi>Letter</hi> which the God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
hath sent from the Third Heaven un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Children of Men. Foolish man often
throws it by like <hi>Wast-paper,</hi> until Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
puts him upon the due, the diligent
study of it. <hi>David</hi> that had a <hi>lesser Bible</hi>
than we, could say in <hi>Psal. 119. 23. Princes
did sit and speak against me;</hi> but what was
the issue of the <hi>Affliction</hi> which the Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
and Obloquy of his Persecutors gave
unto him? It follows, <hi>Thy Servant did Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate
on thy Statutes.</hi> Bad weather in the
World makes Afflicted men to keep their
Eyes much upon the <hi>Light shining in a Dark
place</hi> unto them. To Meditate on a fit
portion of the Bible, dwelling on every
Verse, till at least one <hi>Observation</hi> and one
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:36303:19"/>
                           <hi>Supplication</hi> be drawn from it; hath not
seldomer been the <hi>Ease,</hi> than it hath been
the <hi>Work</hi> of Afflicted Men: And God will
hereby help you, as to a better <hi>Relish</hi> of,
so to a fuller <hi>Comment</hi> on these Miraculous
Lines than once you had: The bitter Tang
of <hi>Afflictions</hi> will bring you to a better
Taste of that Book, whereof the Psalmist
could say, <hi>How sweet are thy words unto my
Taste!</hi> A <hi>Leaf</hi> of the Bible appears (as
to <hi>Luther</hi>) not to be parted withall for <hi>all
this whole World;</hi> chiefly unto those whom
<hi>Affliction</hi> hath convinced of the <hi>Vanity</hi> and
<hi>Vexation</hi> here. But this is not all; the best
Expositors of not a few <hi>Assertions</hi> in the
Bible are some sore <hi>Afflictions</hi> in the World.
The <hi>Stars</hi> and the <hi>Scriptures</hi> are seen best in
a Frosty Night. The <hi>Mysteries</hi> of a <hi>Well-ordered
Covenant,</hi> the <hi>Maeanders</hi> of a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful
Heart,</hi> the worth and use of <hi>Great
and Precious promises,</hi> you will best under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
in your Afflicted Hours. <hi>Adversity</hi>
makes a Verse of <hi>Scripture</hi> to be not like a
Verse of <hi>Ovid,</hi> as it often is to them that
<hi>are not in Trouble as other men.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>§ The Lord resolves to make you <hi>know</hi>
more, <hi>Fourthly,</hi> of YOUR SELVES.
The Golden Rule, <hi>Know thy self,</hi> is that
which our God will have us Learn, while
we <hi>feel his Rod. A Wound</hi> will convince an
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:36303:19"/>
Emperour that he is <hi>a Man.</hi> It was said
unto <hi>Israel</hi> in <hi>Deut.</hi> 8. 2. The Lord <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled</hi>
them, that <hi>what was in their Hearts</hi>
might be <hi>known:</hi> God will have us to see
our own <hi>Follies</hi> and be <hi>Ashamed.</hi> God will
have us to see our own <hi>Graces</hi> and be <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshed;</hi>
and in the <hi>Furnace</hi> of Affliction
we must undergo a <hi>Fiery Tryal</hi> in order
thereunto. <hi>Scilicet ut Fulvum spectatur in
Ignibus Aurum—</hi> Under <hi>Affliction,</hi> as God
will bring you to say of your selves, <hi>I have
perverted that which is Right,</hi> so he will find
occasion for you to hear him saying to you,
<hi>Now I know that thou fearest me.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>§. But where shall I stop? About the
advancements of <hi>Sight</hi> procured by <hi>Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
I may say as about the Instances of
<hi>Faith,</hi> it is said by the Apostle, <hi>The time
would fail me to mention them:</hi> Yet let me
briefly add; By the <hi>Afflictions</hi> whereof you
complain, God will bring you to <hi>Know</hi>
what SIN is. You that formerly counted
<hi>Stollen Waters are Sweet,</hi> shall now see <hi>Sin</hi>
in a truer uglier dress; you shall see that
it is as in <hi>Ier. 44. 4. The abominable thing,
which I hate, saith the Lord.</hi> God will also
bring you to <hi>Know</hi> what RELIGION
is: You that sometimes have said, <hi>It is in
vain to serve the Lord,</hi> shall now be reduced
unto better Sentiments; you will soon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:36303:20"/>
that in <hi>Psal. 111. 10. The fear of the
Lord is the beginning of Wisdom.</hi> Finally,
God will bring you to <hi>Know</hi> what all <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunary
things</hi> are. You have had your too
<hi>high Thoughts</hi> in your <hi>good Times;</hi> then your
Song was, <hi>My Mountain is made strong.</hi>
God will now show you what <hi>Creatures</hi>
are, and give you cause to say of them,
<hi>They are all Physicians of no value,</hi> and
<hi>They are broken Cisterns that can hold no Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
Well then; say not, <hi>All these things
are against me:</hi> It is a matchless Priviledge

<hi>Eccl. 1. 18. He that increaseth Knowledge,
increaseth Sorrow:</hi> Behold, we may <hi>Invert</hi>
the Words, and not <hi>Injure</hi> the Truth, <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease

                        <p>The interest of <hi>Holiness</hi> will be marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously
befriended in your Souls and Lives,
by the influence of <hi>Affliction;</hi> we are told
in <hi>Heb. 12. 10. That God chastens us,</hi> to
make us <hi>partakers of his Holiness;</hi> that <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness</hi>
which he does <hi>like,</hi> and which is <hi>like</hi>
to himself: These Three will the <hi>Holy</hi>

§. Your <hi>Afflictions</hi> will, <hi>First,</hi> Help
your <hi>Disorders.</hi> Your Souls are depraved
with, or exposed to dangerous deadly
<hi>Disorders</hi> and <hi>Distempers:</hi> By <hi>Afflictions</hi> your
Heavenly Father will <hi>Prevent</hi> them; by
<hi>Afflictions</hi> he will <hi>Redress</hi> them. What are
you <hi>Afflicted</hi> for? See a short and a sweet
account given of this <hi>Physick,</hi> in <hi>Isa. 27. 9.
By this the iniquity of</hi> Jacob <hi>shall be purged,
and all the Fruit shall be to take away his Sin.</hi>
The <hi>first ways</hi> of <hi>David</hi> were his <hi>best ways.</hi>
Why so? Truly, it was because the <hi>first
days</hi> of <hi>David</hi> were his <hi>worst days:</hi> He doth
himself assign this reason of it, <hi>Psal. 119. 67.
Before I was Afflicted I went astray, but now
I have kept thy word.</hi> Usually men <hi>Sin</hi> least
when they <hi>Suffer</hi> most. God will have
<hi>thy ways</hi> too to be <hi>good ways;</hi> they shall
therefore be <hi>ways Hedg'd with Thorns,</hi> that
thy Soul may not step awry: Thy <hi>way</hi>
must be incommoded by <hi>Thorns,</hi> that it
may not be over-run with <hi>Weeds.</hi> There are
great <hi>Sins</hi> which thy wild <hi>Lusts</hi> would hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thee on unto; there is a <hi>Madness</hi> in thy
<hi>Heart</hi> that would produce all manner of
<hi>Mischief</hi> in thy <hi>Life,</hi> if restraint be not
laid upon it; now the Iron <hi>Chains</hi> of <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction</hi>
are clapt upon thee to keep thee
from thy Exorbitancies. What is said
concerning the good Subjects of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:36303:21"/>
                           <hi>Typical, Antiochal</hi> Perfecution, in <hi>Dan.</hi>
11. 35. is to be said concerning the good
Subjects of any Affliction whatsoever, <hi>They
are Purged and made White thereby.</hi> This
more generally; but more particularly, I
would add:</p>
                        <p>§. <hi>Again,</hi> Your <hi>Affictions</hi> will wean your
<hi>Afflections</hi> from the wrong Objects of them.
God will have you to look upon all things
here below with such <hi>Affections</hi> as <hi>David</hi>
had for a <hi>Kingdom</hi> in an <hi>Exile,</hi> and to say,
<hi>I am as a weaned Child.</hi> To this end the
Lord by <hi>Afflictions</hi> layes <hi>Wormwood</hi> on the
Breasts which you have hung too much
upon. He will cause Creatures to be our
<hi>Grief</hi> that they may not be our <hi>God. Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi>
said very true of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> It is <hi>prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipuum
crimen Humani generis,</hi> the <hi>grand
Crime</hi> of Mankind: <hi>Affliction</hi> mortifies that
<hi>Rebellion;</hi> therefore, <hi>David,</hi> are thy <hi>Children</hi>
cut off: therefore, <hi>Iacob,</hi> is the Wife of thy
Bosom snatched out of it; therefore, <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah,</hi>
is thy <hi>Treasure</hi> blasted and wasted:
It is that <hi>Idolatrous Affections</hi> may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called.</p>
                        <p>§. Once more; both your <hi>Graces</hi> and
your <hi>Duties</hi> will be quickened by your <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions.
Afflictions</hi> will prove the <hi>Weights</hi>
by the Hanging whereof upon you, you
shall more flourish like <hi>Palm-trees</hi> in the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:36303:21"/>
                           <hi>Court-yards</hi> of the Lord: <hi>Afflictions</hi> will be
the <hi>Feet</hi> which by treading upon you, will
make you as the <hi>Chamomil,</hi> to grow the
more. <hi>Afflictions</hi> will be the <hi>Fires,</hi> which
like <hi>Viols,</hi> you shall make the better
Musick by being disposed near unto: <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions</hi>
will be the <hi>Spurs</hi> which shall cause
you to mend your pace in <hi>Running the Race
which is set before you. Afflictions</hi>—But
room for enlargement is denyed—In
short; God by <hi>Afflictions</hi> is as it were
pounding or grinding of his rare Spices in
your Souls, the scent of them will now
become very Fragrant, very Glorious.
We have heard in <hi>Eccl. 7. 3. By the sadness
of the Countenance, the Heart is made better:</hi>
God will make that <hi>Heart</hi> of thine very
Serious, very Circumspect, very Spiritual,
and very Heavenly by the <hi>Afflictions</hi> which
thou art prone to quarrel at.</p>
                        <p>O'then say not, <hi>All these things are against
me;</hi> the price of these things is <hi>above Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies.</hi>
Well faith the sentence of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,

                        <p>The Speech of the Apostle to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:36303:22"/>
                           <hi>Our light Affliction here, which is but for a
Moment, works for us a far more Exceeding and
Eternal weight of Glory.</hi> O surprizing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion!
<hi>Light Afflictions</hi> work a <hi>Weight of
Glory! Afflictions for a Moment</hi> work a <hi>Glory
Eternal;</hi> and this <hi>Glory</hi> shall be a <hi>far more
Exceeding Glory;</hi> or, as the Original inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates,
a <hi>Glory</hi> which no <hi>Hyperbole</hi> upon
<hi>Hyperbole</hi> can give a too <hi>Glorious</hi> Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of! Your <hi>Afflictions</hi> do <hi>prepare</hi> you
for, tho' they do not <hi>purchase</hi> for you, the
<hi>Glories</hi> of the World to come. The He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
word for <hi>Glory</hi> signifies the same that
your own sense of <hi>Affliction</hi> feels, <hi>a Weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
thing.</hi> Well, from the one <hi>Weight</hi> you
shall pass to the other. Your Crown of
<hi>Thorns</hi> will shortly be turned into a Crown
of <hi>Glory;</hi> a <hi>Weighty,</hi> a <hi>Massy,</hi> a never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fading
<hi>Crown.</hi> A Roman Emperour once
rewarded one that wore an <hi>Iron Chain</hi> in a
Prison for his sake, with a <hi>Golden Chain</hi> as
heavy in a Preferment afterward: Such,
and more than such at last will be thy Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity.
Art thou <hi>Afflicted?</hi> Be assured,
—<hi>Dolor hic tibi proder it olim.</hi> After thy
<hi>Sowing</hi> time in <hi>Tears,</hi> thou shalt have a
<hi>Reaping</hi> time in <hi>Ioy;</hi> after thy <hi>Bread of
Adversity,</hi> thou shalt come to Eat of the
<hi>Tree of Life in the midst of the Paradise of
God;</hi> after thy <hi>Water of Affliction,</hi> thou
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:36303:22"/>
shalt come to Drink of <hi>the River of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
at Gods right Hand for evermore.</hi> Let
me say to thee as the Martyr to his Friend,
<hi>Thy Affliction will scour and rub thee bright,
that thou mayst be fit to be set upon an high
Shelf in Heaven for ever:</hi> or, let me say to
thee as the Martyr to himself, <hi>Hold out
Faith and Patience, Heaven will quickly make
amends for all.</hi> Thou shalt have the more
of <hi>Heaven</hi> for all thy past <hi>Heaviness;</hi> thou
shalt e're long be received into the place
of <hi>Rest,</hi> and there all thy former Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
will but sweeten the <hi>Times of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing</hi>
which now come <hi>from the Presence
of the Lord.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Say now, O Believer, Are all these
things <hi>Against</hi> thee? O what things can
be for thy Good, if these are not so? Sit
down then, and whatever thy <hi>Afflictions</hi>
are, let these words of the Lord Jesus al-lay
thy <hi>Storms.</hi> Do not now practically

Behold, thou art furnished with <hi>strong

awake, awake, and utter a Prayer.</hi> The <hi>Title</hi> of

prone to make sad complaints unto our
Fellow-worms; unto them we say, <hi>O my
Dead Infant!</hi> or, <hi>O my Lost Estate!</hi> But
<hi>Iob</hi> found cause to say, in <hi>ch. 21. 4. Is my
complaint to Man? If it were so, Why should
not my Spirit be Troubled?</hi> Then let us not
keep saying, <hi>Have pity on me, O ye my
Friends:</hi> But instead thereof let us be say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>The Lord be Merciful unto me a Sinner!</hi>
Do's not thy <hi>Affliction</hi> put thee upon more
<hi>Prayer</hi> than thou didst use before? It is a
sad sign that the <hi>Sower Cup</hi> arrives unto
thee, spiced with the dreadful Vengeance
of God upon thy Soul. An <hi>Affliction</hi> will
neither <hi>come</hi> in Mercy, nor <hi>go</hi> in Mercy,
if much <hi>Prayer</hi> do not accompany it. In
Affliction, <hi>Pray much.</hi> As soon as ever any
<hi>Affliction</hi> befalls us, the <hi>First thing</hi> we
do, should be to fall down upon our
knees, to cry mightily unto the Lord that
his <hi>Grace</hi> may be <hi>Sufficient</hi> for us. And still,
as long as Gods hand is Lying in <hi>Tryals</hi>
upon us, our hand should be lifted in <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi>
unto God. We should <hi>Pray</hi> that our
<hi>Affliction</hi> may be Moderated, that our <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction</hi>
may be Sanctified, that our <hi>Affliction</hi>

                        <head>The Fourth Counsel, big with which
every Affliction saith unto us, as
Eliud unto Eglon, I have a Message
to thee from God; we have spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cify'd

                        <epigraph>
                           <bibl>
                              <hi>Job.</hi> 13. 15.</bibl>

trust in him.</q>
                        </epigraph>
                        <p>An Holy <hi>Resolution</hi> for God is to be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
under every <hi>Afflicition</hi> from God.
<hi>Afflictions</hi> will not be <hi>Against</hi> us, if we Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
under them to be still <hi>For</hi> him from
whom they come. To lay aside no <hi>Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
for all <hi>Afflictions,</hi> to serve a <hi>Smiting</hi>
God as well as a <hi>Smiling</hi> God, to seek a
God that is <hi>Frowning</hi> on us, as well as a
God that is <hi>Owning</hi> of us, this will argue,
<hi>An Israelite indeed.</hi> We should after all
our <hi>Afflictions</hi> be still able to make that
<hi>Appeal</hi> unto the Lord, in the <hi>Psal. 44. 17, 18. All
this is come upon us, yet have we not forgotten
thee,</hi> O Lord. Resolve never to Renounce
the <hi>Truths</hi> of God, Resolve never to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert
the <hi>Ways</hi> of God, whatever your <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions</hi>
are; still, <hi>With full purpose of Heart
cleave unto the Lord.</hi> In <hi>Resolutions</hi> for God,
O be like an <hi>Iron Pillar,</hi> and a <hi>Brasen Wall,</hi>
that cannot be prevailed against.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="45" facs="tcp:36303:26"/>
Resolve to be Holy tho' the <hi>Wrath</hi> of <hi>Man</hi>
would molest you for it. Suppose a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
World should Abuse you and Oppress
you, yet say with <hi>Ioshua, I and my House
will serve the Lord.</hi> Continue <hi>Sacrificing</hi>
to, and <hi>Pleasing</hi> of your God tho' <hi>Cains</hi>
bloody Club should be Cudgelling of you.</p>
                        <p>Resolve to be Holy, tho' the <hi>Hand</hi> of
<hi>God</hi> should distress you in it. When you feel
the Discouragements of the <hi>Narrow way,</hi>
still say with <hi>Paul, None of these things
move me.</hi> Suppose God should inflict the stroke of his Displeasure on your <hi>outward
Man,</hi> still say, <hi>Tho' my</hi> Life <hi>should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
worn away with pining Sickness, yet
to me to</hi> Live <hi>it shall be Christ.</hi> Still say,
<hi>Tho' my</hi> Name <hi>should in the Reproach of the
Drunkard have Cart-loads of Mud thrown
upon it, yet will I labour all I can to honour
the</hi> Name <hi>of God.</hi> Still say, <hi>Tho' I am Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to be among the</hi> Poor <hi>in this World,
yet will I study to be</hi> Rich <hi>in Good Works.</hi>
And still say, <hi>Tho' I cannot have my</hi> Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<hi>like Olive-plants about my Table, yet
will endeavour to be my self a Dutiful</hi> Child
<hi>of God, and as a Fruitful Olive-tree in the
Courts of the Lord.</hi> Once more; Suppose
God should withdraw the light of his
Countenance from your <hi>inward Man;</hi> still
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:36303:27"/>
say, <hi>The Lord shall be</hi> my God, my God,
<hi>even when he</hi> forsaketh <hi>me.</hi> Still say, <hi>I
will</hi> fear <hi>the Lord and obey his Voice, tho
I walk in</hi> Darkness, <hi>and shall see no Light.</hi>
Happy is the <hi>Afflicted</hi> Man, that is a thus
<hi>Resolved</hi> Man. The followers of these
<hi>Counsels</hi> may boldly and safely lay claim
to all the <hi>Comforts</hi> which have this day
been set before the <hi>Heirs of Consolation.</hi>

                  <head>The special Case.</head>
                  <p>But there is a more <hi>special Exhortation</hi>
to be pressed, which may give a Period
unto this Discourse.</p>
                  <p>Let not the loss of Children particularly, as
a thing Against us, cause in us any irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Discomposures.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>loss of Children,</hi> did I say? Nay,
let me recal so harsh a Word; the <hi>Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chresis</hi>
is a little too hard for the Language
of a Christian. The Children which we
count <hi>Lost,</hi> are not <hi>so.</hi> The <hi>Death</hi> of our
Children is not the <hi>Loss</hi> of our Children;
when all the <hi>Losses</hi> of <hi>Iob</hi> were made up
with <hi>Doublings,</hi> yet the Number of his
Children need not be <hi>doubled,</hi> in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storation.
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:36303:27"/>
Our Children are not <hi>Lost,</hi>
but <hi>given back,</hi> they are not <hi>Lost,</hi> but <hi>sent
before.</hi> In such a Dialect have the Sager
Heathen sometimes talked of this Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and shall the professors of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
with bitter Groans enter this among
their <hi>Losses, My Children are Dead!</hi> O
tell it not at <hi>Athens,</hi> publish it not at
<hi>Rome;</hi> lest the Heathen Philosophers hiss
at our weakness, at our Folly!</p>
                  <p>Well, this is the Calamity which many
of you at some time or other have expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
of; <hi>The Death of Children,</hi> this is
a thing which the <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>Iacob</hi> sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
escape a resemblance of their <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
in. Many carry themselves under the
tryal, as if, <hi>A Death of Vertue,</hi> yea as if,
<hi>A Death of Reason,</hi> had therewithal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen
them; but recollect your selves, O
dejected Christians, and be not like them
that <hi>Mourn without Hope</hi> this day. Let
<hi>Bereaved</hi> Parents be yet <hi>Believing</hi> Parents;
the Voice of the <hi>great God that formed all
things</hi> is unto them that in <hi>Ier. 31. 16. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain
thy Voice from Weeping, and thine Eyes
from Tears, for thy Work shall be Rewarded,
saith the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let the Thoughts which have been this
day tendered unto our Improvement, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:36303:28"/>
compose and settle our Royled
minds under this Affliction. Let us not
say, <hi>This thing is Against us;</hi> but let us say,
<hi>The Lord that hath given hath also taken away,
blessed be the name of the Lord.</hi> It is indeed
very true, That this Affliction is none of
the most easie to be born; the Heart of a
<hi>Parent</hi> will have peculiar Passions working
in it, and racking of it, at such a time as
this. Thô there be <hi>greater Sorrows</hi> than
those with which we follow a <hi>Child</hi> unto
the Grave; I bless God, it is a more bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
thing to say, <hi>My Sin is mighty,</hi> or to
say, <hi>My Soul is guilty,</hi> than it is to say,
<hi>My Child is Dead;</hi> that moan, <hi>I have pierc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
my Saviour,</hi> is more Heart-wounding
than to <hi>Mourn as one mourneth for a First<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born.</hi>
Yet few outward Earthly Anguishes
are equal unto these. The <hi>Dying of a
Child</hi> is like the <hi>Tearing off a Limb,</hi> unto
us. But, O remember, That if ever we
had any Grace in our Souls, we have e're
this willingly pluck'd out a <hi>Right Eye,</hi>
and cut off a <hi>Right Hand,</hi> for the sake of
God. Why should we not then at the Call
of God readily part with a <hi>Limb,</hi> and
leave Him room to say, <hi>Now I know that
thou fearest me, because thou hast not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
thy Child when I called for it!</hi> It was
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:36303:28"/>
                     <hi>from</hi> God that we did <hi>Receive</hi> those <hi>dear
Pledges</hi> our <hi>Children,</hi> and it is <hi>to</hi> God that
we <hi>Return</hi> them. We cannot quarrel with
our God, if about those <hi>Loans</hi> he say un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us, <hi>Give them up, you have had them
long enough!</hi> We knew <hi>what they were,</hi>
when first we took them into our Arms:
We knew that they were <hi>Potsherds,</hi> that
they were <hi>Mortals,</hi> that the <hi>Worms</hi> which
usually do <hi>kill</hi> them, or at least will <hi>eat</hi>
them, are but their <hi>Names-sakes,</hi> and that
a <hi>Dead Child</hi> is a sight no more surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
than a <hi>broken Pitcher,</hi> or a <hi>blasted
Flower.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But we did not, we do not know, <hi>What
they might be,</hi> in case they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
among the Living on the Earth.
We cannot tell whether our <hi>Sons</hi> would
prove as <hi>Plants grown up in their Youth,</hi>
and our <hi>Daughters</hi> as <hi>Corner-stones polished
after the similitude of a Palace;</hi> or, whether
our <hi>Sons</hi> might not, like <hi>Isaac</hi>'s Son, do
those things that would be a <hi>grief of Mind</hi>
unto us, and our <hi>Daughters</hi> like <hi>Iephta</hi>'s
Daughter, <hi>be of them that Trouble us.</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
let us be content that our wise and
good God should Carve our Portion for
us; he will appoint us none but a <hi>goodly
Heritage.</hi> Our <hi>Temptation</hi> is no more than
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:36303:29"/>
what is <hi>common to Men,</hi> yea, and to <hi>good
Men.</hi> The biggest part of those <hi>Humane
Spirits</hi> that are now beholding the Face of
God in Glory, are such as dwelt in the
<hi>Children</hi> of Pious people, departed in
their Infancy. And what have we to say,
why we should not undergo it as well as
they! Was the <hi>Infant</hi> whose Decease we
do deplore, one that was very <hi>Pretty,</hi> one
that had pretty <hi>Features,</hi> pretty <hi>Speeches,</hi>
pretty <hi>Actions?</hi> Well, at the <hi>Resurrection of
the Iust</hi> we shall see the dear Lambs again;
the Lord Jesus will deal with our <hi>dead
Children</hi> as the Prophets<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Elijah</hi> and <hi>Elisha</hi>
did by those whom they <hi>Raised</hi> of Old;
he will bring them to us, recovered from
the pale Jaws of Death; and how <hi>Amiable,</hi>
how <hi>Beautiful,</hi> how <hi>Comely</hi> they will then
be, no Tongue is able to express, or
Heart conceive. Tho' their <hi>Beauty do Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
in the Grave,</hi> yet it shall be <hi>Restored,</hi>
it shall be <hi>Advanced,</hi> when they shall put
off their <hi>Bed-cloths</hi> in the <hi>Morning</hi> of the
day of God. Again, Was the <hi>Infant</hi> now
lamented, very <hi>suddenly</hi> snatch'd away?
and perhaps <hi>Awfully</hi> too! not meerly by
a <hi>Convulsion,</hi> but by <hi>Scalding,</hi> by <hi>Burning,</hi>
by <hi>Drowning,</hi> by <hi>Shooting,</hi> by <hi>Stabbing,</hi> or
by some unusual Harm? Truly, it is often
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:36303:29"/>
so, that the <hi>quicker</hi> the Death, the <hi>better.</hi>
It is more desirable for our Children to
feel but a few <hi>Minutes</hi> of Pain, than it is
for them to lye Groaning in those exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
Agonies which would cause us even
<hi>our selves</hi> to wish that the Lord would
take them out of their Misery. As for
any more grievous and signal circumstance
attending of our <hi>Dying Children,</hi> our best
course will be to have it said of us,
<hi>They ceased, saying, The Will of the Lord
be done!</hi> As the <hi>Love</hi> or <hi>Wrath</hi> of God
is not certainly declared in, so, our <hi>Grief</hi>
before him should not be too much aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
by such things as these. And it
is a favour, if so much as one of our
<hi>Children</hi> be left alive unto us. Let not
the sense of <hi>one Trouble</hi> swallow up the
sense of a <hi>Thousand Mercies.</hi> The Mother
from whom a <hi>violent Death</hi> has taken one
of her two Children, may immediately
Embrace the other and say, <hi>Blessed be
God that has left me this!</hi> But once more,
Is the gone <hi>Infant</hi> an <hi>only Child?</hi> Are we
now ready to sigh, <hi>All is gone!</hi> Nay, Thou
hast but a poor <hi>All,</hi> if this were <hi>All.</hi> I
hope, thy <hi>only Child</hi> is not thy <hi>only Ioy.</hi>
If thou hast ever passed through the New
Birth, the sense of thy Soul is, <hi>One Iesus
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:36303:30"/>
is worth Ten Children; yea, One Christ is
worth Ten Worlds.</hi> What tho' all thy
Candles are put out! The <hi>Sun,</hi> the <hi>Sun
of Righteousness</hi> is arising to thy Soul for
ever. An undone Man art thou indeed!
that hast thy little Glass of Water spil'd
or spoil'd, while thou hast a <hi>Fountain,</hi>
a Living Fountain running by thy Door!
The blessed God calls thee, <hi>My Child;</hi>
and that is infinitely better than, <hi>A Name
of Sons and of Daughters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Finally, Have we any Doubts about
the <hi>Eternal Salvation</hi> of the Children
which we <hi>have Bur<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ed out of our sight?</hi>
Indeed, as to <hi>grown Children,</hi> there is
often too sad cause of suspicion or so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitude;
and yet here, the <hi>Soveraign dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posals</hi>
of God must be submitted unto.
Besides, Thô it may be, <hi>we</hi> could not
see such plain <hi>Marks</hi> and <hi>Signs</hi> of Grace
in our <hi>Adult Children</hi> as we could have
wished for, nevertheless <hi>they</hi> might have
<hi>the Root of the matter</hi> in them. There are
many Serious, Gracious, Well-inclined
young People, who conceal from every
body, the Evidences of their <hi>Repentance,</hi>
the Instances of their <hi>Devotion.</hi> You can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
tell what the Lord did for the <hi>Souls</hi>
of your poor Children before he took
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:36303:30"/>
them out of the World. Perhaps they
<hi>sought,</hi> they <hi>found</hi> Mercy, <hi>between the Stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup
and the Ground.</hi> The Child of a God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Parent, is not to be despaired of, thô
<hi>turned off the Gallows.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But as to <hi>young Children,</hi> the Fear of
God will take away all matter of Scruple
in the Owners of them. <hi>Parents,</hi> Can
you not sincerely say, That you have
given, as <hi>your selves,</hi> so <hi>your Children,</hi>
unto God in a <hi>Covenant never to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten?</hi>
Can you not sincerely say, That
you have chosen God in Christ for the
<hi>Best Portion,</hi> as of <hi>your selves,</hi> so of your
<hi>Children?</hi> Answer to this: If your <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi>
had been spar'd unto you, would
it not have been your care to have
brought them up in the <hi>Nurture and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition
of the Lord?</hi> Would you not
have used all Prayers and Pains to have
engaged them unto the Service of the
<hi>Living God,</hi> and unto a just prejudice
against all the vile Idols and vain cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of the World? Then, be of good
cheer: Your <hi>Children</hi> are in a better
<hi>place,</hi> a better <hi>state,</hi> than you your selves
are yet arriv'd unto. The Faithful God
had promised, <hi>I will be their God, as well
as thy God.</hi> O say, <hi>This is all my Desire,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:36303:31"/>
thô the Lord suffer not my House to grow.</hi>
Those dear <hi>Children</hi> are gone from your
kind Arms into the sweet Bosom of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
and this is, <hi>by far the best of all.
To have Children this Day in Heaven!</hi> Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
this is an Honour which neither you
nor I are worthy of. But so it is; The
<hi>King</hi> of <hi>Kings</hi> hath sent for our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
to conferr a <hi>Kingdom</hi> on them.
They are gone from a dark Vale of <hi>Sin</hi>
and <hi>Shame;</hi> they are gone into the Land
of <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Love;</hi> there they
are with the <hi>spirits of Iust men made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect;</hi>
there they <hi>serve the Lord Day and
Night in His Temple,</hi> having <hi>all Tears
wiped from their Eyes;</hi> and from thence
methinks, I hear them crying aloud un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us, <hi>As well as you love us, we would
not be with you again; weep not for us, but
for your selves; and count not your selves
at Home till you come to be, as We, for
ever with the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have done. The fit <hi>Epitaph</hi> of a
Dead Infant, <hi>That,</hi> That alone is enough
to be the <hi>Solace</hi> of a Sad Parent,
<hi>Of such is the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>

            <q>
               <p>I Am sorry to hear that God hath
laid you under that Exercise you
spake of in your first Letter, in the
Death of Children. But if Heathenish
Men could take their little Babes and
burn them in the red Fire, in Love
and Honour to their Idol-God, the
Devil; how should we who have Hope
in God, blush at the least Heart-ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
against such Determinations as
are made by his all-disposing Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
whereby he picks and chooses
what Flowers please him best. We
have nothing too sweet for Him.</p>
               <p>I sometimes have been refresh'd in

               <l>Christ would in Glory have a Flower sweet,
prime,</l>
               <l>And having Choice, chose this my branch
forth brought:</l>

of mine.</l>
               <l>

               <l>That as I said, I say, Take Lord, they're
thine:</l>
               <l>I piece-meal pass to Glory doe in them.</l>
