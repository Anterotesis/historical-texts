            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Impreſs thereof upon my Conſcience, that it

Piece now preſented to you, will ſpeak my
reſſent<hi rend="sup">ments</hi> more expreſly about this Subject. It
comes out in a very plain dreſs, and without
trimming, the matter thereof being ſufficient
to commend its own worth to can did Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
and intended for the loweſt forms of
Chriſts ſchool,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 2.</note> as well as for his Graduates.

               <hi>ſave Ieſus Chriſt and him crucified,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 4.</note> in the
efficacy of his Reſurrection, and in the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip
of his ſufferings, being made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
to his death. Its not therefore the
inticing words of mans wiſdom I would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in and labour for; but the demonſtration
of his Spirit and Power. Herein I would ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly
deſign through his Grace to imitate
P<hi rend="sup">aul</hi>, as he followed Chriſt. <hi>None but Cbriſt, none

I would make it my deſire and joy, my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve

<pb facs="tcp:114748:4"/>
his Al-ſufficient Spirit. Your Acquaintance

            <p>If this poor Tract may be found, any way
ſerviceable to the improvement thereof, my
heart ſhall rejoyce and bleſs God for it. Your

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Salvation of Gods people by Jeſus
Chriſt, is the Scope and Sum of Law and
Goſpel, Old and New Teſtament. Our
great Apoſtle preached this at <hi>Epheſus,</hi>
powerfully, effectually. His labors were
wonderfully bleſſed from Heaven in that
place, ſo eminent for Pomp and Pride,
wealth and wickedneſs. Many of Chriſts ſheep were there
gathered into his fold, of whoſe welfare, <hi>Paul</hi> in his abſence,

was moſt ſolicitous. He therefore ſends them a gracious Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute,
and begins with the didactical part of Chriſtianity,
to ſettle their minds and hearts in the main Truths, and Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of faith. From the great Myſteries of their Election and
Predeſtination, he leads them gradually to the review of their
Redemption and Vocation, that they might the more effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly
be rooted and grounded in the Truth of Chriſt againſt
all the errors of the wicked. Thence Obedience is preſſed
on them in the practical part, Grace <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2+ letters">

            <p>From which Premiſes: Three Concluſions naturally flow,</p>
            <p>1. That a Chriſtians Vocation is a moſt eminent Thing.</p>
            <p>2. All Chriſtians are obliged to walk worthy thereof.</p>
            <p>3. Chriſtians ſhould uſe the moſt effectual helps for mutual

               <head>1. Concluſ.</head>
               <head type="sub">A Chriſtians Vocation is a moſt Eminent Thing.</head>
               <p>For Explanation, this word <hi>Vocation</hi> is conſiderable in
Scripture-dialect, largely and ſtrictly. 1. Largely, ſo it imports
an external Call, given to many by the Goſpel, who never
partake of the power thereof; witneſs the various Gheſts,
mentioned,<note place="margin">Mat. 22. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. Many ſuch are called, though but few
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:114748:10"/>
be choſen. This is common to the whole viſible Church.
Secondly. Strictly it ſignifies that internal Call which effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly
flows from Gods eternal election, and infallibly leads
to Glory, deſcribed <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 28. 29, 30. This is peculiar to
Gods Elect, the members of his inviſible Church, who are all in
due time efficaciouſly called.</p>
               <p>This Calling hath a double Aſpect, general and particular:
1. General, towards God in all the wayes wherein he is to be
owned for our. Soveraign, Lord and chief good in Chriſt; this
concerns all, thus to love and fear, to ſerve and truſt him with
the utmoſt of the whole man. Secondly, It hath a particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
towards Man, in the various Relations of this life, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
every one hath his particular charge to attend upon, in each
reſpective Station, differing one from another, as Superiour, or
Inferiour, in publique or private, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

of God towards Man, calling him to himſelf; uſually it holds
out the ſtate of man whereinto he is brought by that Divine

Acts in correſpondency thereto</p>
               <p>This phraſe in the Text is comprehenſive of all, in the full

concur harmoniouſly. He is the fountain and the final
Cauſe, whence it flows, and wherein its terminates. He is the
Prime and choiſe Agent, who appoints and over-rules all
Means, in tendency thereto. His Voice gives the formal Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion

according to his eternal purpoſe, to be a fit ſubject for the
Reception and Improvement thereof. He ſpeaks actively and

and pulled away the ſhoulder againſt ſuch a Call? Is it not a
burning ſhame, that any Creature ſhould prevail more with
our ſpirits by their Syren-charms, then the voice of Chriſt
himſelf, calling on us ſtill by his Spirit, Word and Providence?
It is our ſin, let it be our ſorrow, that we ſo readily hearken
to ſelf, ſin and Satan; are ſo deaf, ſo dull and dead to the
cals of God. Lets heartily grieve that our ſouls prove ſtill ſuch
drie tinder to ſo many Temptations of the common enemy,
and ſuch green wood to the ſparks of Heaven. We are as ſoft
wax to the Tempters impreſſions, which eaſily touch and
take; but cold and ſtiff to the renewed expreſſions of the Lords
Spirit.</p>

Spirit of Chriſt convinces of ſin ſtill,<note place="margin">Ioh. 16. 8, 9, 10.</note> and of righteouſneſs, when
he is about this effectual call. He awakens the conſcience to
liſten after his voice, though not in all alike. He deals with
men in a rational and orderly method, ſuited to their various

ear, and rowzing thy conſcience, to ſee thy ſelf a forlorn,
ſinfull Wretch?<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 15.</note> Haſt thou felt the pangs of the new Birth?
Hath the Spirit of Bondage made thee ſenſible of thy ſinfull
ſlavery in Satans drudgery? Haſt thou found thy ſelf loſt in
the wilderneſs of ſin and ſorrow, like a poor Traveller that is
bewildred in the woods and bogs among cruel Tories, liſtening

the Lord allured thee into the wilderneſs, that he might there

into any ſoul, but are ſtill attended with a gracious Train, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering
the whole man into a gracious ſubjection: Hath he
ſo come to thee, as a mighty Conqueror, gaining thy heart,
to yield up thy ſelf upon his terms, at his mercy, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
or capitulations? Haſt thou ſurrendred all the powers
and parts of ſoul and body, with chearfull ſubmiſſion into his

His called <hi>Ones,</hi> are his faithfull ones, following him
fully in an obedience of faith and love. Hath he thus ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually
prevailed with us to make us faithfull, loving and
obedient, according to his Articles of marriage in every Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
condition and occaſion? Is our obedience cordial
and conſtant,<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 24.</note> univerſal and perpetual, at leaſt in our purpoſe
and endeavours? Is there no Duty we would willingly neglect,
no ſin we would leave unmortified, no mercy of his that we
would not fruitfully improve? Is his Will our Rule, his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
our End, his Grace our Principle, his Spirit our ſtrength,
whether in ſuperior or inferior places, in every Ordinance and
Providence?<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 6.</note> Doth our faith work by love to him, and all his
peculiarly,<note place="margin">Gal. 6. 14.</note> fervently, orderly and continually? Is it our deſire
and delight,<note place="margin">Mat. 10. 38.</note> deſign and labor to follow him through fair and
foul,<note place="margin">Mar. 8. 34.</note> through the Croſs to the Crown, through many tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
into his Kingdom of Grace and Glory?<note place="margin">Luk. 9. 23.</note> Have we none
in Heaven but him,<note place="margin">Pſal. 73. 24.</note> none upon Earth in compariſon of him?
If thy Vocation be a ſaving one, its an eminent One in the
exerciſe of every Grace, in the crucifying of every Luſt, in
the reſiſting of every Temptation, in the bearing of every
Affliction upon his account.<note place="margin">Mat. 11. 28, 29.</note> Art thou as willing to take up
his yoak, and to learn practically of him, meekneſs and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,
as thou art deſirous of his Reſt? Doſt thou as chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
ſtudiouſly obey every Precept, as thou deligheſt in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Promiſe of his gracious Covenant? Is it thy trouble and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:114748:15"/>
grief, that thy ſelf and others do ſo diſhonour and diſobey him?
Is it thy chief joy to ſee him honoured &amp; obeyed by any of his?
Doth the ſenſe of thy ſinfulneſs ſtill conflicting within, make
thee to cry out againſt thy wretched ſelf? Doth the ſight of
his Grace any way made good to thee, melt thy ſoul into

Ones. Your Vocation is moſt eminent, ſo is the Cordial
that flows from it againſt ſin and ſorrow, the fleſh and the
world, ſelf and Satan. He hath called you to Glory and
Vertue,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 3.</note> through Glory and Vertue, who is faithfull, and will

to be conformed to the image of his Son,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 28, 29, 30.</note> that he might
be the firſt born among many Brethren. Moreover, whom he
did predeſtinate, them he called; whom he called, them he
juſtified; whom he juſtified, them he glorified. Therefore
ſhall all things work together for good, to them that love
God, who are the called according to his purpoſe. Is not this
golden chain of your ſalvation a Soveraign Antidote againſt
all fears, from within and without, to be carefully laid up, and
laid out as the Apoſtle did? Thou trembling ſoul, whoſe
heart is tender, that wouldſt fain love Chriſt, and loth ſin above
all, that thou mayeſt follow his call, is not this thy priviledge?
Shouldſt not thou join with him, in caſting the Gantlet, and
biding Defiance to ſin and Satan,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 32, 33, 34, 35.</note> to ſelf and the world, as he

canſt thou look more for? The more unworthy and inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent

thy ſtrength and ſtay lies in him alone, and not in thy ſelf.
Though thou often break,<note place="margin">Ioh. 10. 3, 4, 27, 28, 29, 30.</note> yet doth he not break, who cals his

Haſt thou not ſlighted and abuſed him too long, in rejecting

not ſufficiently wearied thy ſelf in thy wildred ſtate,<note place="margin">Luke 15.</note> like the
Prodigal Son, from one Bog to another, from one Luſt to

to Chriſts Call? Hath not he waited long enough on thee
with intreaties and offers, precepts and promiſes, chidings and
threats, wooings and expoſtulations, Directions and Incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements
of all ſorts? Have not his Law and Goſpel, his
Mercies and Judgements ſounded loud and long enough about
thee to call thee to Chriſt out of ſin and ſelf? Shall nothing
prevail, art thou grown ſo dull, ſo dead and obdurate, like
the Smiths Anvil, and his ſleepy Dog? Hath Satan ſo far
blinded and hardened thee, that thou canſt not deliver thy

Chriſt is come once more to give thee a Call. Now hearken

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Two main things he cals thee to mind, Diligence and
Dependance.</p>
                  <p>1. Diligence in the uſe of all means appointed by him in his
Word and Providence. Look for him, and hearken to his voice
in every Duty, in every Mercy; attend on him in every Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
and Providence. Neglect not any opportunity of
ſeeking his face, ſtudying his Word, praiſing his name, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting
with his People. Be much in ſecret and fervent Prayer,
ſigh and groan, cry and chatter, if thou canſt not ſpeak plain.
Let his Sabboth and ſervice be precious to thee, and duly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.
Perform every Duty as thy laſt, and as for thy Life,
ſlight not any help from his meaneſt ſervant, make choiſe of
ſome ſpecial boſom friend, whoſe Prudence, Tenderneſs and
Love may be moſt helpfull to thee. Be much in the ſtudy of
Scriptures, ſuch eſpecially as moſt ſute thy caſe. Attend on
the publique Miniſtry with faith and diligence, as upon the
great Ordinance of Heaven for Conviction, Converſion,
and Confirmation of Souls.<note place="margin">Rom. 10. 14.</note> How ſhall men believe, unleſs
they be preached to? How ſhall men preach, unleſs they be
ſent? Make uſe of others Experiences for Direction and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement.
Beware of Mountebanks and jugling Seducers,
that will poiſon and skin over thy ſores, and at beſt, can give
but a palliate cure, with all their Bragadoxia's. Be willing
to be dreſſed to the quick, by ſuch ſober and skilfull Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
ſuch ſpirituall Chirurgians as the Lord doth appoint and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:114748:17"/>
bleſs to his People. Thou wilt not truſt thy Eſtate, thy Cloaths,
thy Body and Temporals with Idiots, and unskilful perſons.
Should not thy ſoul be much dearer to thee, then to be truſted
with unlearned Empyricks, that have gotten ſome few receipts
with many brags? In a word, be moſt diligent in every
Relation and occaſion to ſerve the Lords Spirit, and obſerve
his Will, by the right uſe of all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Means, for his Honor,
and thy good.</p>
                  <p>2. Dependance on him wholly and ſolely he requires alſo. Its he
alone that muſt bleſs the means,<note place="margin">Iſa. 26 3, 4.</note> and will be truſted for it.
He bids thee roll thy ſelf upon his Grace, lie at his feet, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
him in <hi>All.</hi> This is the Angel of the Covenant,
whoſe motion muſt communicate a healing vertue to the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of <hi>Betheſda,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ioh. 7.</note> and of the Sanctuary. He can heal at the
Pool, if not in the Pool. The ſenſe of thy weakneſs &amp; emptineſs
muſt ſtill drive thee to him for ſtrength &amp; fulneſs. He calls thee
to reſt upon him, to derive from him, and keep cloſe to him for
ſupport &amp; ſupplies in every condition. It is his Grace muſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
&amp; purge, direct and quicken, reſtore and ſave. His preſence
and bleſſing is the cream and ſubſtance, the Life and vigor of
every Ordinance,<note place="margin">Pro. 3. 6.</note> of every Creature. Apply therefore his
gracious Promiſes in order thereto.<note place="margin">Exo. 20. 24.</note> He will be ſought and
found in all his ways,<note place="margin">Iſa. 64. 5.</note> to meet us with a Bleſſing, where ever he
records his name. He meets them that rejoice, working righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
thoſe that remember him in his ways,<note place="margin">Mat. 16. 19, 20.</note> and is ſtill preſent
where two or three are met together in his name. He hears in
ſecret,<note place="margin">Mat. 6. 6.</note> and rewards openly thoſe that depend on him. The more
thou findſt thy ſelf unable, unskilfull and unwilling to good,
the more depend thou on him, who hath an Al-ſufficiency of
skill, Power and Will for thy good. So ſhall his Grace be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
for thee,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 9, 10.</note> and his ſtrength ſhall be perfected in thy
weakneſs.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Chriſtians that are efficaciouſly called, ſhould
be ſtirred up to make Improvement of their eminent Calling.
Hath the Lord vouchſafed ſo ſingular a favour to any of us?
How can it but inflame our hearts with gratefull reſcentments
thereof? Should we not with the Apoſtle, admire the dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions

moſt expedient for his honor and ſervice. Unworthy
walking is moſt diſgracefull and diſadvantagious to his name
and cauſe, to his Truth and Grace, to his friends and ways.
The Glory of all his Attributes is deeply concern'd in his
Peoples walking. He minds them of it ſtill in his Word and
Providence. <hi>Chriſtiani ſancte vixiſſent,</hi> ſaid the Heathen

                        <hi>Si Chriſtus ſancte docuiſſet.</hi> Theſe are the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

the reproaching Gentiles of the Jews unworthy carriage, in

us then our beſt comforts. We are his workmanſhip, creat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in Chriſt Jeſus unto good woks,<note place="margin">Eph. 2. 10.</note> which he before ordained
for us to walk in. His Intereſt requires that all his Children,
Servants and Subjects ſhould walk like him, and with him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
and after him, from him, and for him.</p>
                     <p>2. With Reference to man; a Chriſtians worthy walk con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
wonderfully to the publique Good, and his own Credit
and Comfort,<note place="margin">Tit. 2. 11, 12, 14.</note> very many wayes. Chriſtians ſhould be ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to maintain good works, as things moſt profitable to men.
They are redeemed by Chriſt to be a peculiar People,<note place="margin">Tit. 3. 8, 14.</note> zealous
of good works. The welfare of the whole depends very
much upon the worthy Demeanor of every part, in its reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
ſtation and motion. Unworthy walking is the great
Obſtructer of all publique Intereſt, civil and ſacred. Thereby
are the wicked hardned in ſin, and the godly grieved and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenanced.
The Cement and Juncture of all ſocieties are

thereby. The very props and baſes of every common-wealth

more efficacious then Precepts, for good againſt evil, <hi>Docemur

Dung-hils, Popiſh rubbiſh, and <hi>German</hi> ſinks, are put

with the reſt of ſuch wretched traſh are diametrally croſs
to the Truth in hand. The conceit of univerſal Toleration of
all things, pretending to Conſcience, though clearly evil, is
of the like Tendency, as alſo many of the Romiſh Principles,
pointed at elſewhere. Thoſe who think themſelves bound to
follow the Light within, in every ſuggeſtion, (without regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
and Limitation of the Scripture-Light) cannot but run
into thouſand hazzards and diſorders, towards deluſion and
confuſion. Such expoſe themſelves to every unclean and ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

To be given up to our own hearts Luſts,<note place="margin">Pſal. 81. 11, 12.</note> to walk after our vain

walk unworthy of Chriſt. The whole world lies in wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs,
being like a great Bog, wherein multitudes utterly looſe

a thouſand plunges among ſwarms of ſpiritual Tories, towards
deſtruction, if Grace prevent not. Becauſe this vaſt Bog is
fairly garniſhed with flouriſhing graſs, it deceives millions, that
do prefer it before Chriſts high road, which is hard and ſtony,

one graſſie plot to another, they ingulf themſelves into dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
quagmires of ſin and ſorrow. Conſider it all ye that walk

and Wordlineſs, under the guidance of cheating Impoſtors and
fleſhly Luſts. How unworthy of Chriſts name are you, that
walk ſo unworthily after Vanity and Lies, to the ſhamefull
diſgrace of your Profeſſion? Could you but ſee your Ghoſtly

the deſires of the fleſh and of the mind. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges

uſe of ſtill by evil Spirits, to enſnare Travellers in the miſty
night of Ignorance and Error, into dangerous Plunges
and Precipices, by drawing them out of Chriſts high way?
Will you ſtill pretend to be Chriſts Souldiers, whilſt you
are marching after his deſperate Enemy, under the conduct
of ſin, Satan and ſelf? Is it not pitty, that any of Chriſts
friends ſhould be ſo unfriendly to him, and walk ſo unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of his Vocation, as to be found walking in the crooked
By-paths of Error and Sin? Should not Gods Children be
aſhamed of ſuch an Ignoble and baſe Demeanor, raking the
Channels, and embracing Dung-hils among the beggerly
Drudges of Satan? Should not his ſervants be deeply hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
for their ſhamefull neglect of his work, whilſt they are ſo
unworthily buſied and ſtirring about the Devils own Work?
Should it not grieve Chriſts Spouſe at the very heart, that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Embraces and Communion with the fleſh and world
are at any time preferred before Communion with the Lord

in that condition wherein the hand of Heaven hath
ſettled thee, that thou envieſt not what any other enjoyeth,
but rejoyceſt in his good, grieving for his evil, as if it were thy

often reviewing thy heart and life, to obſerve thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs,

and to mend all faults by the Lords gracious Help?
Doth the ſenſe of thy Unworthineſs and Inſufficiency ſtill

ſhould be ſo unfrequented, whilſt ſinfull, worldly walks are

that ſo much labor ſhould be ſtill beſtowed upon this car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe,

Name, which is called upon us? Are not we all eminently

and Inferiors ſtudy and pray, believe and conſult, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
and endeavour more effectually for this Goſpel-du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
ſo Important and neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>1. Superiors are eminently called thereto, that they may
walk worthy of the Lord, who dignifies them with the Title
and function of his Deputies and Repreſentatives. He would
have them to do moſt for him, and be moſt like him, who
receive moſt from him, and have moſt account to render
to him. They bear his Image and Authority, natural and
moral in a ſingular way, that they may be directed, excited
and enabled to honor and promote his Power and Will, more
ſpiritually and efficaciouſly. Their Work and Burthen, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
and ſnares, are much more then others; they therefore
need ſtill to be moſt watchfull and diligent in their Chriſtian
Walk. His Promiſes and Encouragements, Preceps and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections,
Menaces and Judgements are eminently diſpenſed
towards them for good againſt evil. They are his Lieutenants
and high Stewards, to Rule under him, according to his
Word, for his Glory, and their Inferiors good. <hi>Boleſlaus,</hi>
King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> was wont to carry his Fathers Image in
his Boſom, and often to kiſs it, with a ſolemn wiſh, that he
might do nothing unworthy of ſuch an eminent Parent and
Pattern. Should not all Superiors be often viewing and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing
the Lords Divine Image, carrying in their heads and
hearts, the gracious Characters of Chriſts Righteouſneſs and
Holineſs, that they may ſtill act and walk worthy of ſuch a
Father? <hi>Magnates</hi> will ſtill be <hi>Magnetes;</hi> perſons of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
and Power are great Loadſtones, that will draw many
either to good or evil. Superiors are the Looking-glaſſes of
their Families, City and Country, by whoſe preſident, moſt
will dreſs themſelves. Like heavenly Bodies in ſuperior Orbs,
they ſtill carry a forcible Influence, whether benign or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lign,
by their multiplicious Aſpects and Motions. Like the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:114748:24"/>
grand wheels of Clocks and Watches, they Regulate or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb
all the reſt. Like <hi>Jeremies</hi> figs, they do much good, or
much hurt. The <hi>Jews</hi> were once baniſhed out of <hi>England</hi> for
poiſoning the publique-ſprings, to haſten an Epidemical Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine.
Our Governors whether Oeconomical, or Political,
Military or Eccleſiaſtical, are our publique Springs, which if
poiſoned, will prove moſt pernicious to all. <hi>Ingentia benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,
Ingentia maleficia, Ingentia ſupplicia.</hi> The aggravations
of Divine favours abuſed, aggravate mens ſins and ſufferings.
They that have moſt of the ſweets of the world, have their
ſutable ſnare of the bitters thereof, to prevent abuſe and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting.
Crowns are ſtill lined with cares, and <hi>onus</hi> is never
ſevered from <hi>honos,</hi> Duty being ſtill an inſeparable companion
to Dignity. The ſervant intruſted with his five Talents, hath
the greater account to give up at laſt of his Improvements.
<hi>Promotion comes not from the Eaſt or Weſt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 75. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>it riſes not from the
Duſt, its God himſelf that puts up ſome, in pulling others down.</hi>
He advances none to feather their Neſt, to pleaſe themſelves,
and to ſerve their Luſts, but to ſerve him and his. He expects
moſt Rent from the greateſt Farms. The greateſt of men
are his Tenants at Will, holding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>in capite</hi> from him, <hi>quoad

Calculators hand, ſome whereof he places for Units and Tens,
others for hundreds and thouſands. When the ſupputation
is over, and this Life at an end, they are alike again, as to
Externals. This world is but a ſtage, wherein all ſorts have
their part to act, being uſhered in by Divine Providence in
their ſeveral orders and Ranks. That which makes the real
difference between men and men, is their worthy walking,
wherein conſiſts the true Grandure and noble Gallantry of
Superior Perſons. What <hi>Ageſilaus,</hi> King of <hi>Sparta</hi> ſaid of the
<hi>Perſian</hi> King, he is indeed greater, if better then I, is worth
conſidering among all perſons of Authority. Whilſt Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors
walk worthy of their Calling, they prove choiſe Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in the Lords own hand, to diffuſe the Communications
of his goodneſs proportionably to their greatneſs. When our
<hi>Maximi</hi> appear <hi>Optimi,</hi> in their higher Spheres, as they reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
him moſt from whom they receive all, ſo do they moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:114748:25"/>
the publique Weal, and their own Comfort, in promot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his honor and Intereſt. Their countenance and diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
carry ſtill a great ſtroke for good or evil.</p>
                  <p>2. Inferiors ſhould alſo be ſtirred up to walk worthy of their
Vocation. The meaneſt Member in the body Natural, Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
and Eccleſiaſtical hath its proper place, work and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs.
The Lord deſpiſes not the weakeſt Children, nor the
pooreſt Lambs of his houſe and flock. Much ſervice may be
done by the loweſt perſons for God and their Country. It
was the poor man that ſaved the great City, though very
few took notice of him,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 9. 15.</note> or of his Wiſdom. The ſmalleſt
Wheels in a Clock and Watch, are of need and uſe. We
cannot ſpare the leaſt finger or Toe. Faith and Prayer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
moſt in ſecret, when little diſcerned. The Graces and
Gifts of Chriſts holy Spirit,<note place="margin">Eph. 4.</note> are variouſly diſpenſed for Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement,
in order to the benefiting of the whole by the
contribution and concurrence of every part thereof.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.</note> Its not
by Chance,<note place="margin">Col. 2. 19.</note> Fortune or Luck, that any are brought to a low
condition, but by the wiſe. Providence of God, who beſt
knows what place is fit for every one to ſtand and more in.
He ſets the Limits of mens habitations,<note place="margin">Act. 17. 26.</note> and gives every one
his Task to perform in his great family of the Univerſe. He
gives ſpecial Rules to all Inferiors, as well as to Superiors,
whether private or publique, civil or ſacred, witneſs <hi>Pauls</hi>
Epiſtles, and all other parts of Divine Records. He expects
Returns ſutable to mens Receipts,<note place="margin">Mat. 25. 15, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> and rewards the Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the two Talents, as well as of the five. The beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and ſtrength of every Society, conſiſts mainly in the proper
motions of the leſſer, as well as of the greater parts. The wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
walking of Inferior Chriſtians conduces very much to the
adorning of their Profeſſion. Moral vertues and ſpiritual
Graces, ſhew their native Beauty beſt in a plain dreſs and
familiar Garb. Chriſtian humbleneſs and ſelf-denial, Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
and Patience, Sobriety and Contentation. Laboriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Fidelity, Submiſſion and Dependency ſhine clearly
in a low eſtate, as the ſtars in a froſty night. There is a Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy
and reciprocation ſo neceſſary among all the greater
and leſſer members of the Body,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 21.</note> that one cannot ſay to the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:114748:25"/>
other, I have no need of thee. Chriſt himſelf paſſed through all
the conditions of man in his progreſs of Humiliation, from his
Conception to his Aſcention, ſtooping to the loweſt and moſt
abject, that he might ſweeten and ſanctifie them all to his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
Comfort, and for Gods Glory. He emptied himſelf; took
on him the form of a ſervant, became a Worm, and denied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
continually for a Pattern to all.<note place="margin">Phll. 2. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.</note> They that have leaſt of the
Worlds Profits, Pleaſures, and Preferments, have leaſt of the
cares and ſnares,<note place="margin">Pſal. 22. 6.</note> troubles and account that accompany them.
Providence ſo orders and attemperats all conditions below,<note place="margin">Iſa. 53.</note>
that the Bitter ſweets of every relation,<note place="margin">Iohn 13.</note> may be ſtill effectual
motives, inducing all ſorts, to walk worthy of their Calling.
The myſterious Theologie of the Ancients repreſented this by
the two famous Tuns, ſtanding continually before <hi>Jupiters</hi>
Throne, the one full of Hony, the other of Gall: out of both
which, he is ſtill ſprinkling and diſtributing among all Mortals,
ſuch proportions, as beſt fit their ſeveral ſtates and relations.
Inferiors are commanded ſtrictly by the Apoſtle, as well as Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors
to abide with God in that calling whereunto they were
called, that they may walk worthy of their vocation, as becomes
Chriſtians.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 20.</note> He repeates his Charge and Inſtructions to them, to

                  <p>Thus ſhould all Chriſtians mind their obligations to Chriſt,
and be vigorouſly preſſed to ſtudy their Calling, and ſeek his
face with induſtrious Diligence, that in the faithfull uſe of all

               <p>THE Deduction of this Inference appears in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
rational arguing, and his cogent preſſing of the

therefore the Priſoner of Jeſus Chriſt do beſeech you,</hi> &amp;c. Every
word here is moſt emphatical and weighty; what was thus
written, was for our learning, and concerns all Chriſtians. His
induſtrious care to quicken thoſe eminent Profeſſors, that they
might improve all effectual means for mutual helpfulneſs, is a
ſingular direction and encouragement to all, on the like ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,</p>
               <p>The confirmation of this Truth is abundantly cleared and
ratified in the whole <hi>Series</hi> of Divine Records. The Prophets

ſo fervently ſtill inculcated and preſſed in all parts
from age to age even upon all Gods People. The high Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations
and ſignal Rewards largely beſtowed on the due
Obſervers, and the Menaces and Judgements diſpenſed
againſt the Neglecters hereof verifie the ſame. The Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial
Types and Prefigurations pointed at this many ways.

                     <hi>In him we live, move and have our Being,</hi> both natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
and Spiritually. He ſuits all means to their proper ends,
dealing with men by men, after the manner of men in a ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
communicative way. His immediate concurrence is ſo
abſolutely needfull to the producing of every effect that his

and diſpoſition thereof. Yet is he pleaſed to accomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
his Divine Actings to the ſtate of his ſeveral Creatures
in their reſpective Beings and Workings, whether neceſſary
or contingent, whether natural, moral or Spiritual. His uſual
Method is to walk in his own road, to bleſs his appointments,

to his own Pleaſure and Diſpoſe.<note place="margin">Iſa. 64. 5.</note> He ſtill uſes means
though he needs them not,<note place="margin">Mat. 7. 7, 8.</note> and would have all his People inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
and ingenuouſly active in all the ways of mutual
helpfulneſs. He gives out his Grace and Bleſſing gradually
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:114748:27"/>
and proportionably, through the Conduits and Pipes of his
own Inſtitutions, ſutably to their ſeveral Capacities. Chriſtians
are like narrow-mouth'd veſſels, that can receive the Liquor
infuſed but by little and little Their condition below is ſtill
indigent, that they may honour and enjoy Chriſt therein, in
living more by faith, and leſs by ſenſe: yet doth he not leave
them deſtitute of help,<note place="margin">Gal. 2. 20.</note> but trains them up in an orderly way
of Chriſtian Communication,<note place="margin">Hab. 2. 4,</note> through the multiplicious ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations

                  <p>Thirdly, Their many temptations challenge the ſame alſo?
Sin and Satan,<note place="margin">Eph. 2. 2, 3.</note> the fleſh and the world, Earth and Hell, are
deſperately combined againſt Chriſt,<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 11, 12.</note> and againſt his friends,
Children and Servants. The Prince of this world maintains
ſtill a threacherous party in our very hearts, and fits all his
ſnares to our various tempers and diſtempers. His hooks are
ſtill plauſibly baited, and his Ingeniers are very numerous
and active, ſubtle and ſtrong, malicious and vigilant. Chriſts
flock is but a very little one, in compariſon of ſo many goats
and ſwines, foxes and wolves, Lions and Bears, that ſtill malign
it.<note place="margin">Luk. 12. 32.</note> We are ſtill ſurrounded with Spiritual wickedneſſes, and

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:114748:27"/>
form,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 2. 16.</note> whilſt they deny the Power thereof. The baits of this
world are very catching &amp; wonderfully ſpecious to allure all
ſorts to ſwallow down the hook,<note place="margin">Mat. 24.</note> ſo fairly dreſſed with ſeeming
pleaſures, profits and preferments. Errors and Luſts are highly
ſublimed and refined in theſe later days, to take ſilly ſouls,
and to deceive the very Elect as far as is poſſible. Falſe Chriſts
and falſe Prophets abound every where, to divert, pervert and
ſubvert Chriſtians from Chriſts waies. Lying wonders &amp; Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines
of Devils are ſo fairly trimmed and garniſhed over
with lightſome colours, that very many are eaſily cheated with
their jugling tricks. Every rank and degree of men, in every
relation, hath ſtill its peculiar way of temptation. Every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
is therefore ſtill peculiarly concern'd to give and receive
all poſſible help in the right uſe of all the means appointed
of God for mutual reciprocations. The coals and ſticks put
orderly together, do help one another to burn and kindle,
whereas if ſcatteringly diſperſed, they will ſoon go out.
Stragling Soldiers are ſtill expoſed to danger, but keeping cloſe
in a firm Body, by mutual help, they prove formidable to the
enemy, and uſefull to friends. In all ſocieties, civil and ſacred,
mutual helpfulneſs is of ſingular uſe to the preſervation and
regulation of the whole, and of every part. The beſt are
too ſubject to grow lazy and cold, ſelfiſh and dull, through
the prevailing of renew'd temptations: it becomes there,
fore all to improve all effectual means for the mutual quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of each other to the grand duty of their Chriſtian walk,
anſwering their Call.</p>

                  <head>Application may be made hereof very uſefully.</head>
                  <p>1. BY way of Inſtruction in vindication of the Miniſtry
and Miniſters of Chriſt. They are appointed and
bleſſed of him, as a ſpecial means towards the foreſaid end,
and therefore moſt maligned and oppoſed by the common
enemy, Chriſts ordinances are his Charets of ſtate, wherein he
rides in progreſs among men, to diſpenſe his gifts and graces
unto them. His Miniſterial ſervants are peculiarly entruſted
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:114748:28"/>
therewith, as Inſtruments and ſtewards under him, by whom he
brings home his people to himſelf, to build them up in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
The many honorary Titles which his Word diſcribs
them by, ſetting forth their office, denote their Duty to the
effecting thereof. The ſame Engine which is mounted by
notional Spirits, againſt Chriſts Inſtitutions, would as eaſily
level the Magiſtrates civil conſtitutions. When men ceaſe
to be weak and ſinfull, they ſhall then ceaſe from needing ſuch
helps, and not till then. Evangelical worſhip muſt conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
in force, till every one of Gods Elect be perfectly
brought to the full meaſure of the ſtature of Chriſt. The
Miniſtry was given for that purpoſe by the Lord Jeſus, as
the choiſe Product of his Aſcenſion. Both the Office
and the Officers are peculiarly ſet in the Church by God
himſelf, that his People may never want ſufficient means
for effectual quickning in their Chriſtian walk. The holy
Ghoſt makes them Overſeers, who being by him duly qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified,
are orderly called to rule in the Church, after due
probation and approbation. Such ſhepheards as come in at
his door he bleſſes to his People; the reſt he accounts but
Thiefs and Robbers, who intrude themſelves into the Lords
flock in an ill manner, and to an ill end. Confuſions in his
Church are as diſtaſtefull to him, as they are deſtructive
to his. Himſelf makes the difference between Rulers and
thoſe that are ruled, whilſt he forbids them Lordly-dominion
and arbitrary dictates; he commands them to look to their
charge with all Authority in his name and ſtrength, requiring
their flocks to ſhew their obſervance and Chriſtian obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
according to his Word. If every one were left to
his own Will, How ſoon would Anarchie and deſolation ruin
Church and State? All will become ſlaves, whilſt all do
ſtrive to rule and tyrannize; none ſtudying to obey. Good
Intentions will excuſe no man from the ſin and Judgement of
irregular Uſurpations. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah</hi> and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzias</hi> met with ſad
ſtroaks in their bold invaſions of the Sacerdotal Work. <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah</hi>
and his company of pretended Saints, <hi>Jeroboam</hi> and
his ſelf called Prieſts, ruined themſelves and followers
by their illegal Intruſions, if any that are called Miniſters,
prove a blot to their Profeſſion, by their ignorance, ſloth
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:114748:28"/>
or ſcandall, good reaſon they ſhould be reckoned with, as
they do deſerve, but little cauſe that Chriſts faithfull ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
ſhould ſuffer for their ſake. If any thing be found
to be unſcriptural, that hath been uſed about any Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of his, the fault may be mended without imparing
of his Inſtitutions. If any cannot find benefit by Chriſts
appointmenss, let them blame themſelves and not him, nor
his. Is the Spirit of the Lord reſtrained? Doth not his
Word do good to them that walk uprightly? As all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
need mutual quickning, that they may walk worthy
of their vocation, it becomes them to mind and obſerve that
Goſpel-miniſtration, which Chriſts ſpirit ſanctifies ſo gloriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the enlightning and enlievening of all his choſen, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his Word.</p>
                  <p>2 It ſpeaks convinction to all that are careleſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to give or receive this quickning helpfulneſs. This is
a common and ſad miſcarriage among Chriſtians, and the beſt
find much cauſe to blame themſelves for their guilt thereof. As
its our ſin, it ſhould be our ſorrow that we do ſo much evil,
and ſo little good, we receive not friendly Admonitions in
a friendly way; thereby diſcouraging thoſe that would help
us with ſeaſonable adviſe. Our ſores muſt needs wrankle for
want of dreſſing, and our ill humors cannot but increaſe
and diſtemper us for want of purging. We are more aſhamed
to hear of our faults, then to commit them, and more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to neglect our duty, then to hear of it. Should it not
ſhame us to find ſelf ſtill ſo prevalent in us againſt others
good, and againſt our own, by thus ſhrivelling up our
minds and hearts, our tongues and hands, that this ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
charge cannot be diſcharged? Sinfull baſhneſs makes us
ſtill unwilling to offend others by our faithfull dealing; and
ſelfiſh Love makes us as ready to be offended at their faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
dealing. Chriſt was full of bowels, and cloathed with
them; we are empty and deſtitute thereof. <hi>David</hi> deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be ſmitten by the ſeaſonable reproof of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
eſteeming it to be a precious Balm that ſhould not
hurt his head: Why ſhould any of us be of another mind?
Are not the wounds of a friend more faithfull then the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:114748:29"/>
kiſſes of an enemy? Why ſhould any be counted our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
for telling us the Truth, as <hi>Paul</hi> was among the fooliſh
<hi>Galathians?</hi> Why ſhould we be backward to receive and
and give that Chriſtian help by mutual reciprocations, which
our abilities annd opportunities challenge clearly from us?
Let it grieve us that we have ſo often grieved the Lords
Spirit, in grieving his friends by ſinfull ſilence, neglects and
offences. Lets be aſhamed, that Heathens and Turks, Jews
and Papiſts ſhould out-ſtrip us in the demonſtrations of
mutual helpfulneſs. What Bunglers are we at this noble
Trade? How untowardly and unskilfully do we go about
it? Are not we often like fooliſh Chirurgions, miſtak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Caſe, and wronging the Cure? Do not we uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
run into extreams of fond pitty, or cruel Auſterity?
Are not we found too indulgent, or too impatient, too
mild or too harſh? Should we not be humbled for our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence
and ignorance, our raſhneſs and unhandſomneſs, our
paſſion and pride, our ſloath and frowardneſs about this

deſire to be found ſtill in a readineſs for Chriſtian help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs?
Do we delight in all officious reciprocations of

mutual quickning? Is it our deſign and reſolution, to take
nothing ill, but all in good part at the hand of others, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
to be as friendly to them in all due ways of Chriſtian
freedom and aſſiſtance? Do we actually endeavour to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
it in the moſt effectual means, that may beſt conduce
to the mutual quickning of each other in all the ways of

Do we to that end, prize and improve every Ordinance of

duty in all chriſtian reciprocations of advice and help through

takes notice of two ſpecial ranks of Chriſtians therein, ſome

qualified and orderly called in a regular way
of probation and approbation to the charge of Gods houſe,
What their office is, and perſons ſhould be, Divine Records
teſtifie at large.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 1, 2.</note> They are termed his Stewards and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raulds,
his Meſſengers and Ambaſſadors.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 18, 20.</note> Shepheards and

at once their Duty and Dignity.<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 11.</note> Some were extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

were the Apoſtles,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 20.</note> Prophets and Evangeliſts, whoſe work
being done, their office expired, together with their gifts.
The ordinary Rulers continue as Chriſts Reſidents to the
worlds end, the need and uſe of their office continuing
ſtill, whilſt ſuch do act, becomming their function, they
prove ſhining nnd burning Lights indeed, helpfull to each
other for the good of the flock. They are often minded
of their work,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4, 13, 54, 1, 156.</note> requiring ſpecial diligence and care, that
looking to themſelves and to their Doctrine, they may
ſave themſelves, and thoſe that hear them inſtrumentally
in ſubſerviency to the Lords Spirit. The Lord binds
them to their good behaviour, as ſuch who are ſingularly

Heaven and Earth. If any of them degenerate as unſavery
Salt, they become moſt vile, fit but for the Dung-hil. <hi>Opti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi
corruptio</hi> is ſtill <hi>peſſima.</hi> If they be not good, they are
very bad. Their Burthens and Snares, Oppoſitions and
Difficulties are ſo numerous, that they do need mutual
helpfulneſs in a ſpecial manner. Their due correſpondency
and orderly aſſociations; their frequent meetings and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
compliance, are much to be deſired, promoted and
improved: being uſefull helps through Gods bleſsing to
the better diſcharge of their Duty. Their Circumſtantial
differences in opinion or practiſe, ſhould not hinder them
from this great Duty, but rather quicken them thereunto,
that they may be found to keep the Unity of the Spirit in the<note place="margin">

of all the Gifts and Graces beſtowed on them,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 14.</note> that
they may be moſt exemplary to others in all the ways of
Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Private Chriſtians being Chriſts ſubjects, the ſheep
of his paſture, the members of his Body and Family, his
trained Souldiers, and Diſciples in his ſchool have as much
need of this mutual helpfulneſs. 1. More generally towards
all fellow-members. 2. More particularly towards their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Rulers.</p>
                  <p>1. More generally, Chriſtians are ſtrongly obliged to uſe
all effectual means, for their reciprocal exciting of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that they may walk worthy of their Vocation, in every
Ordinance and Providence of Chriſt, as becomes their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Relations. Multiplicious Helps doth the Word of God
provide to that end: to the right uſe whereof they are ſtill
vehemently preſſed, eſpecially thoſe that do follow, which we
ſhall but hint, being ſo copiouſly amplified in ſacred Writ;
and commented on by ſo many choyce Pens.</p>
                  <p>1. Cordial Affection, and indearing Love, uniting them to

They that have purified themſelves in obeying the Truth,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 22.</note>

vigorouſly charged, thus to love one another with a pure
heart, fervently. This is the great wheel that muſt move all

the reſt. Its a Divine Grace, of a ſpecial Nature, the Rare
Cement whereby the Spirit knits their Hearts in One, though
their minds may differ, and their perſons may be at diſtance.
This is the fire,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 17</note> that muſt ſtill conſume all riſing corruptions,
and enflame all the powers and parts of the whole man,<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 3.</note> with

As far as any bears true love to God, ſo far, and no

                     <hi>abides in God.</hi> By this Token were all Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
diſcerned from all others, as by their Badge of Honour.
This is the Oyl of the Sanctuary that muſt anoint them with
heavenly Joy, and ſupple all their wheels; that every motion
may be plyable and ſmooth, for their mutual help; the want
of this is the ſhame of Chriſt and Chriſtianity, the ſcandal of
men, the joy of Hell, the ſadning of Heaven, the bane of our
comforts, the blaſt of all labours, the very peſt and ruin of
all things. Oh! that Chriſtians were more ſenſible of it and
quickned thereto.</p>
                  <p>2. Tender compaſſion towards each other, in all troubles
and wants,<note place="margin">Phil. 2. 1, 2, 3,</note> proportionable ſtill, to each of their various con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.
Such a Sympathy and fellow-feeling Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf

Members muſt needs be ſenſible of each others ſmart; if one
ſuffers, all muſt needs ſuffer, in the Body of Chriſt myſtical, as

A praying Chriſtian is ſtill doing and receiving much
good. God honours this Ordinance moſt, becauſe it honours
him moſt, in all his Attributes. The groans and ſighs, the
tears and cries of his poor weaklings are forcible Arguments,
and efficacious Tools, which he cannot gainſay, and will not
reſiſt. They pierce through his heart, and draw out his bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els,
by a Magnetick Vertue, which Chriſts Spirit, through his
blood and Grace imparts to them, by a Divine Touch. All
Chriſtians ſhould therefore improve the ſame, to the uttermoſt
for others,<note place="margin">Iob 15. 4,</note> as for themſelves. Apoſtacy begins ſtil with ſlight
eſteem and neglect of prayer, publike and private. A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
ſo diſarmed, is nakedly expoſed to the malice of his ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
enemies, to be captivated into errour and ſin at Satans
pleaſure. All the great wonders of the latter dayes, are to
be carried on by prayer. The ſpirit of the living creatures,
that moves in all the wheels of Providence, turns this grand
wheel of fervent prayer,<note place="margin">Ezek. 1. 20, 21.</note> to make all the reſt work,<note place="margin">Ezek. 36. 37.</note> energeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally

The Primitive Chriſtians were eminent for this. I my ſelf,

                     <hi>am perſwaded of you my brethren, that ye alſo are
full of goodneſs, filled with all knowledge, able alſo to admoniſh
one another.</hi> Brethren, ſaith <hi>James, if any of you do err from

converts a ſinner from the error of his way,</hi>

from death, and ſhall hide a multitude of ſins.</hi> This choyſe help
ſhould be as willingly received,<note place="margin">Prov. 29. 1.</note> as given. He that being often
reproved, ſtiffens his neck, ſhall ſuddenly be deſtroyed, and
that without Remedy. This Fraternal act of true Love, (di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
from the Rulers Authoritative acts, whether Doctrinal,
or Diſciplinary,) requires much caution and warineſs, tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and wiſdom, meekneſs and fidelity, with mutual watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs.
Chriſtians ſhould not curiouſly pry into anothers
failings, nor maliciouſly ſearch into doubtful unknown mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
to trouble or diſgrace him.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.</note> True Love thinks no evil, but
covers a multitude of faults. We ſhould be moved with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
reſpects to Gods honour, to our neighbours good, that
his faults may be dreſſed and healed, confeſſed and amended,
by the right uſe of this Divine Medicine, orderly applyed,
Chriſtians therefore ſhould look well firſt to themſelves, to
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:114748:35"/>
pluck every beam out of their own eye;<note place="margin">Matth. 7. 5.</note> and proceed by the
ſure Rule of Gods own word herein, not upon their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions,
attending all circumſtances of time, perſon, place,
and manner ſo prudently, that good and no evil may be done
thereby. In perſonal injuries that concern our ſelves, much
of pardoning ingenuity is ſtill expedient, that we may ſtill ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
this Duty, to proceed from our obedience to Chriſt, and
zeal for his Name, as from tenderneſs to our Neighbours com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
and credit. Much ſugar is needful to ſweeten this Pil,
which of it ſelf is very harſh and bitter unto fleſh and blood.
Its an Ordinance of chief worth and uſe, eminently appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and bleſſed from the God of Heaven, to the healing of all
diſtempers infeſting his people. This ſpiritual bone-ſetting
and Chirurgical dreſſing is no bunglers work, but challenges
all due skil and care from Chriſtians hearts, as from their eyes
and hands.</p>
                  <p>6. Chearfull Condonation in freely pardoning all injuries
done us by others miſtakes.<note place="margin">Matth. 18. 21.</note> Chriſt expreſly requires, though
it be to ſeventy times ſeven, from day to day. Rancor and
Revenge he abominates, though the ſweeteſt morſel to a
carnal heart.<note place="margin">Matth. 11. 25, 26.</note> When you ſtand praying ſaith Chriſt, <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give

<hi>Paul,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eph 4. 32.</note> 
                     <hi>tender-hearted, forgiving one another, even as God
for Chriſts ſake hath forgiven you. Put on therefore as the

                     <hi>holy and beloved, bowels of Mercie, Kindneſs,
Humbleneſs of mind, Meekneſs, long-ſuffering, forbearing and
forgiving one another: if any man have a quarrel againſt any,
even as Chriſt forgave you, ſo alſo do ye: and above all
theſe theſe things, Put on Charity which is the bond of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</hi>
We ſhould be alwaies ready to accept of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling
terms, and pitty others, that do offer us wrong; ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then to cheriſh ſpleen and malice in any degree; ſuch
Candor of Spirit becomes Chriſtians, who ſtill find cauſe
to bewail their own failings, and wrongs towards others.
If we be enforced at any time to challenge our civil rights,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:114748:36"/>
it ſhould be done with ſuch diſcretion, as that we may
avoid Jars and reflections, Paſsions and Prejudices. If
others offences may ſeem to carry much of aggravation
therewith, we ſhall ſhew the more generoſity and true gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry
in forgiving and forgetting all that perſonally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
us. Its the Glory of God to cover a matter; and
mans Glory to imitate him.<note place="margin">Prov. 25. 2.</note> He proclaims himſelf to be
the Lord, merciful and gracious, of long ſuffering and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

mercy for Thouſands, pardoning iniquity, tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
and ſin. Should it not be our Delight to reſemble
him therein, as its our honour thus to advance his name?
How ſad were it with us, if he ſhould deal with us as we
deal with others? Do we not ſtill need pardon from men, as
well as from God? Shall we not willingly meaſure out to
others,<note place="margin">Matth. 7. 12.</note> as we would deſire to be meaſured to? The Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
<hi>Roman,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 6. 31.</note> and the noble <hi>Grecian</hi> thought it the beſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
to return good for evil, and ſcorn the baſeneſs of
a ſpitefull ſpirit? Shall Chriſtians come ſhort of Heathens
herein? They have the worſt of it that do offend us, as
<hi>Precious</hi> Mr. <hi>Dod</hi> was wont to ſay, pitty them, pray for them
help them to repent, as God hath helped us by Patience
and Love, kindling ſuch a fire on their heads, as may
melt their hearts?</p>
                  <p>7. Ingenuous diſpoſition and carriage of our thoughts,
words and actions, with utmoſt candidneſs of Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
about the Intentions, Expreſſions and Demeanure of
others.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13. 4, 5, 6, 7.</note> It becomes Chriſtians to make the beſt Conſtruction of
all others that may poſſibly be. Charity ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> by
choiſe Experience ſuffers long, and is kind; it envies not, it
is not raſh, it is not puffed up, it doth not behave it ſelf
unſeemly, is not eaſily provoked, thinks no evil, rejoyces
not in Iniquity, but rejoyces in the Truth, covers all things
(ſo the Greek <hi>Stegei</hi> properly imports,) believes all things,
hopes all things, endures all things. Brethren, Therefore
if a man be over-taken with a fault,<note place="margin">Gal. 6. 1, 2.</note> ye that are ſpiritual, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore
ſuch a one with the Spirit of meekntſs, conſidering thy
ſelf,<note place="margin">Rom. 14, 12, 13.</note> leſt thou alſo be tempted, let us not then judge one another,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:114748:36"/>
any more, but judge this rather, that no man put a ſtumbling
block,<note place="margin">Rom. 15. 1, 2.</note> or an occaſion to fall in our brothers way. We that
are ſtrong, ought to bear with the infirmities of the weak,
and not to pleaſe our ſelves, but every one to pleaſe his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
for his good to edification. We ſhould wiſely diſcern
between weakneſs and wickedneſs, between infirmities and
enormities. There will be ſtill many ſickly, froward and
pettiſh Children in Chriſts family, that muſt be tenderly, not
roughly medled with. Grace will teach us ſo to obſerve their
ſeveral tempers and diſtempers, as to think of them, ſpeak and
act towards them in the beſt way of doing moſt good, and
leaſt hurt. Imprudent and rugged Chriſtians will be ſure to
do themſelves and others wrong, in bringing diſgrace to their
profeſſion for want of diſcret moderation. Some Spirits re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
the ſweet <hi>Bazil,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Guicchiardin.</note> (as the <hi>Genoan</hi> Embaſſador obſerved
in the Duke of <hi>Florences</hi> Garden) which if gently touched,
will yield a fragrant ſmell, but if harſhly cruſhed, will ſmell
rank and ſtrong, and give a very offenſive Odor. Others ſeem
like Nettles, which if they be not very warily handled,
will ſting and trouble one with ſmart and anguiſh. Study we
therefore induſtriouſly, that we may neither give nor receive
offence,<note place="margin">Mat. 10. 16.</note> as far as we are able, being wiſe as Serpents, innocent as
Doves, in ſuch a crooked generation.</p>
                  <p>8. Meet Conſolation ſutably to the various conditions of
other Chriſtians in their ſpiritual or temporal troubles. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we ſhould be followers of Chriſt, who made it his buſineſs
to ſpeak comfort to the broken-hearts, and mournfull Spirits.
<hi>He was anointed from Heaven to that end,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 50. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>that he might ſpeak a
word in ſeaſon to the weary ſoul. He ſends his Spirit to be our
Comforter, and comforts us in all our tribulations, that we may
be able to comfort others alſo with the ſame comforts wherewith
we our ſelves were comforted of God.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>If there be therefore any
conſolation in Chriſt, if any comfort of Love, if any fellowſhip
of the Spirit, if any bowels and commiſerations, fulfill ye my joy</hi>
ſaith the great Apoſtle,<note place="margin">Phil. 2. 1. 2.</note> that ye may be like minded, heartily
giving refreſhment to others in their neceſſities: to ſpeak and
act like Chriſt, in this very thing muſt needs be deſireable in the
higheſt degree. Should not Chriſtians demonſtrate themſelves
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:114748:37"/>
to be true <hi>Barnabaſſe's</hi> Children of conſolation?<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 3.</note> Is it not our
honour that the <hi>Father of Mercies, and the God of all conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
will imploy us inſtrumentally, that he may create the
fruits of our lips, <hi>Peace, Peace, true and laſting Peace to
the diſtreſſed?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 57. 19.</note> Much wiſdom is required in adminiſtring of
ſuch a cordial, orderly and ſeaſonably, ſo as it may do good
and no hurt. The matter of it is extracted out of Divine
Promiſes and Providence: the Spirit of Chriſt muſt direct us
by his Word to the right manner of diſpenſing it. He purges
and prepares the ſouls of his people, as wiſe Phyſicians deal
with their bodies: that he may revive and corroborate. He
removes the cauſe of grief that the effect may ceaſe.<note place="margin">Ioh. 16. 8, 9, 10.</note> He clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
away ſin to take away ſorrow. He convinces of ſin, of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
and of Judgement, that he may be a ſure Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter.
He ſhews unto men the worſt of themſelves, that they
may come to ſee the beſt of Chriſt. He makes them poor in
Spirit,<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.</note> to hunger and thirſt, mourning after Purity and Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
that he may bleſs them with the Comforts of
Peace. Let's learn in his ſchool to follow his Coppy, and
mind ſuch a Divine Principle, and Patten of Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>9. Liberal Contribution freely to communicate to the
ſupport and ſupplies of others wants, as God enables us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
all Chriſtians. As we have therefore opportunity, let
us do good to all, eſpecially to the houſhold of Faith. Charge
them we muſt that are rich in this world,<note place="margin">Gal. 6. 10. 1 Tim. 6. 17, 18, 19.</note> that they be not high
minded, nor truſt in uncertain riches, but in the living God,
who gives us all things richly to enjoy, that they do good, that
they be rich in good works, ready to diſtribute, willing to
communicate, laying up in ſtore for themſelves a good founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
againſt the time to come. This is ſo needfull a duty that
they who have nothing but their own labor, are bid and bound
to ſpare out of that for thoſe who cannot work. Chriſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
all to be lent to himſelf, which is given to his poor
members He is ſlighted,<note place="margin">Eph. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>. 28. Mat. 25.</note> when they are ſlighted. The rich
are entruſted with their own and the poors porti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n alſo, that
they may be bountifull, and others gratefull, and that God
may be honoured both waies. Chriſt became poor to enrich us
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:114748:37"/>
that we might be able and willing to Relieve the poor. It muſt
be our wiſdom not to feed others luſts, whilſt we labour to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
their wants, and to prevent their becoming poor if we can;
by all due means regularly appointed by Divine and humane
Laws.<note place="margin">Heb. 13. 16. Rom. 12. 13. 2 Cor 9. 5, 6.</note> To do good, and to communicate forget we not, <hi>for with
ſuch ſacrifices God is well pleaſed, whilſt we deſtribute to the
neceſſities of the Saints, being given to hoſpitality.</hi> Therefore
let your gift be ready, as a matter of bounty, not covetouſneſs.
He that ſows ſparingly ſhall reap ſparingly. Let every one
give not grudgingly or of neceſsity, for God loves a chearfull
Giver. <hi>Paul</hi> preſſes this at large in the eight and ninth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 16. 1, 26</note> and appointed the firſt day of the week
as the fit ſeaſon for it, being the chriſtian Sabbath, well known
and obſerved in all chriſtian Churches, according to Chriſts
Prediction and Inſtitution, ratified ſtill by the Apoſtolical ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration
thereof.<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 3. 17, 18.</note> 
                     <hi>Who ſo hath this worlds goods</hi> ſaith the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved

                     <hi>if thy brother be waxen poor, or fallen into decay, then thou
ſhalt relieve him. Chriſt bleſſes thoſe, and welcomes them
his Fathers Kingdom, who have been carefull to viſit and refreſh
him in his little ones under troubles and wants.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 25.</note> A nigardly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
is no good Religion. When God hath opened the heart,
the hand will not be ſhut up. What a ſhame it is that any

in the ſupplying of others Neceſsities.<note place="margin">Luk. 16. 9.</note> Chriſt bids us make
friends of the Mammon of iniquity, which may receive us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
eternal dwellings. All our abilities ſhould be ſo improved, as
that we may thereby comfortably walk in the way to Heaven
through the Grace of Chriſt.<note place="margin">Iam. 2. 17. Gal. 5 6.</note> 
                     <hi>That Faith which is deſtitute

though not <hi>cauſa regnandi:</hi> we cannot be ſaved without them,

Charity.</p>
                  <p>10. Impartial adminiſtration of Ordinances, Cenſures and
Chriſtian helps to all concerned in a regular way, ſo that the
meaneſt may be condeſcended to, &amp; not ſlighted by any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality
in what their caſe requires. In eccleſiaſtical as in civil judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
Gods forbids all partial reſpectings of perſons,<note place="margin">Lev. 19. 5. Deut. 1. 16. Deut, 16. 19.</note> that
bring in neglect of juſtice &amp; due to any one. This excludes not
civil reſpect due to any perſon, not confounding the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and diſtance, which Providence hath ſettled among men
in their ſubordinate relations. In religious matters it is Grace
that makes the difference between man and man. They who
have the leaſt degree thereof have their common ſhare in
Chriſts family, of portion and priviledge, as all the members
in the body natural to the meaneſt of them have their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Intereſt in the whole. God would not have ſpiritual
matters carried on by any ſelfiſh byaſſes, but would have
Chriſtians to ſtoop one to onother, to be of the ſame mind one
towards another,<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>not minding high things, but condeſcending to
men of low eſtate, and not being wiſe in their own conceit.</hi> Chriſt
himſelf taught his Diſciples ſo by his own practiſe, <hi>waſhing
their feet, ſtooping to them, teaching them to ſubmit to the loweſt
office of Love and help</hi> for each others good after his Pattern,<note place="margin">Ioh. 13. 12, 13, 14, 15.</note>
                     <hi>ſeeing the ſervant is not greater then his Lord. You ſhall not
Lord it one over another</hi> ſaith the Lord himſelf, <hi>but who ſoever

                     <hi>let him be your ſervant.</hi> This
humble way of mutual condeſcenſion and ſerviceableneſs is
the moſt honourable conformity to the King of Saints, the
fountain of Honour, and the beſt means of gaining Repute
among wiſe men. When it began to be neglected in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Churches,<note place="margin">Iam. 2. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. 1 Pet. 2 13, 14, 17, 18.</note> the Apoſtles were forced to quicken them
by cogent arguments to this choice Duty, &amp; to convince them
of the contrary evil. <hi>My brethren</hi> ſaith <hi>James, have not the

obedience to whom it is due,<note place="margin">Rom. 13. 7.</note> according to Gods Word. Yet
doth it alſo teach condeſcenſion,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. Eph. 4.</note> that the pooreſt may not be

as the Lord hath ordered for them in his Kingdom and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.
All ſocieties require ſuch an orderly care of all their

labouring with prudent ſubmiſſion to give reſpect to others as

and Providence, not yielding to the leaſt beginning of Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
from God,<note place="margin">Col. 2. 5, 6, 7.</note> and his ſervice. Herein Chriſtians ſhould be
mutually helpful, in corroborating and ſtrengthening each

to walk in him,<note place="margin">Matth. 13. 20, 21.</note> as they firſt Received him. Chriſt gives a warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

againſt the leaſt inclinations to breach and Diſorders,

What a ſhame it is, that any Chriſtian ſhould lend his tongue
