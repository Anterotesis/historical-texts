            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHEN <hi>Rome</hi> shrunk into a <hi>Pigmies</hi> Skin from that <hi>Gigantic</hi> stature she was once of, (in those dayes when the <hi>Tyber</hi> did out-swell the <hi>Ocean) Naples</hi> may be sayd to have stuck closest to Her of any, and continues so still; for to this day she ownes Her for her <hi>Mistress,</hi> and <hi>Lady Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount,</hi> In recognition wherof the <hi>Spanish</hi> King payes Her a Heriot, with a Rent of seven thousand Duckets every Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Eve, till which be done he lyeth under the Curse of the Church which is quickly <hi>on</hi> and <hi>off.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> being so delicat a peece of the <hi>Europaean Continent,</hi> and having had such vicissitudes, and various turns of Fortune, may well deserve for those two respects, to have a Chronicle of it self in one entire peece, which was not done yet under this <hi>Meridian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Touching first, all do acknowledg that for deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of all things, either for common use, pleasure, or wonderment, <hi>Naples</hi> may be call'd <hi>Natures Darling,</hi> who seems to study how to make her self admir'd in divers places; <hi>Ceres</hi> and the <hi>God</hi> of Wine strive there for Mastery; She a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds with Silks, Oyles, Fruits, Flowers, Roots, Fowl, Fish, and Flesh, with an incomparable Race of Horses, as also with such a choice of fragrant Wines, that She may be call'd <hi>Bacchus</hi> his <hi>Inner Cellar</hi>: It is also the Country where <hi>Manna</hi> is gather'd, and She hath the best Medicinall Baths that the Earth affords.</p>
            <p>Now this rare fertility may be impted, not so much to the heat of the <hi>Air,</hi> as to the Sulphureous quality and heat of her <hi>Soyl</hi> also, which though it be over-violent in som places, causing <hi>Incendiums</hi> and <hi>Earthquakes,</hi> (the one if the irruption of the fire be deep, the other if it be neer the Superficies) yet this fire dilating it self up and down through her bowels, it
<pb facs="tcp:96399:3"/>
makes the Womb of the Earth more prolificall. Touching the Territories annexed to her Dominions, som of them as <hi>Apul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>a</hi> may contend with Her for fecundity, but others not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> specially <hi>Calabria</hi> which compard to <hi>Naples</hi> may be sayd to be a course List at the side of a peece of fine Scarlet.</p>
            <p>Now, for the Inhabitants (wheron the second reason depends) they may be sayd <hi>to have much of Vertue and no less of Vice,</hi> and were they cast into a Balance one could hardly discern which Scale wold be traboccant and over-poising; They are magnificent both in Houses and Habit, they are free and full of Complement, yet though the <hi>Hall</hi> be commonly open, the <hi>Closet</hi> is shut, though the face be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clouded <hi>(Viso sciolto)</hi> and free, yet the <hi>Heart</hi> is close and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servd: The same may be sayd of the <hi>Mouth</hi> and the <hi>Hand,</hi> when the first open's widest the other is closest shut; They are in their Method of Devotion, pious and charitable, their stately Temples, and Monasteries demonstrat the one, and their <hi>Lazarettos,</hi> or Houses for the Poor do verify the other, specially that of <hi>Monte de pietà,</hi> an Hospital of 60000. Duck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets of yeerly Revenue, whose Officers upon som Festivals go in Gowns of white Sattin. Now, for the mass of ordinary peeple, as there is a common Saying of <hi>England, Inghilterra buona Terra, mala Gente, England</hi> is a good Country, but the people are bad; so there is a worse Saying of the <hi>Napolitan,</hi> that it is <hi>Vn Paradiso piantato da diavoli,</hi> It is a Paradis pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled by Devils; Indeed the <hi>Napolitan</hi> according to the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Soyl is of a fiery boyling Nature, which makes the Spaniard ride him with a Bitt and a Martingall, he hath as many Whirlwinds in his Brain and quicksands in his Brest, as the <hi>French</hi> or any other Nation; Witness else their sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Innovations, for <hi>Naples</hi> had in two yeers no less then five Kings of severall Countries, Insomuch that I have not read of any Politicall Instrument so often out of tune, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving had forty popular <hi>Revolutions</hi> in less then four hundred yeers, yet none that brought a <hi>Ruine</hi> with it.</p>
            <p>Touching this last Revolution in the yeer 1647. it was the violent'st of <hi>all,</hi> it was like a Candle burning at both ends, the common peeple were all as mad as if they had bin bit by a worse thing then the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap>: In which Revolution there were so many prodigious things happend, that were they not
<pb facs="tcp:96399:3"/>
               <hi>recent,</hi> and don as it wer but t'other day they wold be held for meer <hi>Romances</hi>; For it requires a strong faith to beleive that in so well a policed Christian Citty, so replenishd with No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, Gentry, and Gown-men of all Professions as <hi>Naples</hi> is known to be, there shold be such horrid Barbarismes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; That this Tumult from a small spark shold com to be so huge a fire, from a little source shold com to be such a rapid Torrent, that from a weak blast it shold so suddenly com to such an impetuous Whirlwind, that it shold begin with a score of <hi>Boyes,</hi> pursued and ended with so many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of <hi>Men</hi>; That a young barefooted Tatterdemalian Retaylor of Fish, shaking off his blew Wascot and red greasy Bonnet, shold so suddenly com to have such an ascendent upon the spirits of the peeple, as within three or four dayes to govern <hi>Naples</hi> in chief, and being clad in Cloath of silver to ride so triumphantly with naked Sword in hand (and his brother as despicable a thing as he in Cloath of gold) atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with an Army of fifty thousand men, and so march up to the Castle where the Vice-roy kept his Court, where he forc'd him to grant whatsoever he proposed; That in so short a tract of time he shold mount to such a <hi>despoticall,</hi> or rather <hi>Imperiall</hi> power for nine dayes together, as to give the Law to Nobility, Gentry, and Comminalty, that his single Warrant shold have Authority enough to chop off any mans head, to plunder and burn any Palace, wherof there were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove sixty that became Sacrifices to Vulcan by the fury of the <hi>Peeple,</hi> which was more raging then the flames of the <hi>Fire</hi>; Insomuch that it may well be sayd the Napolitan Courser never foam'd so much at the mouth before: 'Tis true he was galld with Gabels, which found way from the roots under ground to the tops of Trees upon all sorts of Fruits; <hi>Masanello</hi> got all those Gabels and Taxes to be utterly damn'd, with all other that were impos'd upon the Citty of <hi>Naples,</hi> and other places above a hundred years before; which being done the fickleness as well of Fortune as of the common peeple, was never more confirm'd then in the handling of this man, for having Lorded it and Signoriz'd in <hi>Naples</hi> more then ever the great Turk did in <hi>Constantinople</hi> for nine daies (for he prov'd but a nine dayes Wonder) the tenth day he was slain by the same peeple that rais'd him, his body was dragg'd up
<pb facs="tcp:96399:4"/>
and down the streets and hurl'd into a Ditch, his head chop'd off and put upon a Pole, which yet the same peeple took out the next day, and washing it clean, they sow'd the head to it again, and perfuming both, they carried him in a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn procession up and down the Citty, with thousands of Torches and so buried him in the honorablest way that could be in the great Cathedrall Church.</p>
            <p>Now in this prodigious Revolution ther wer many things of extraordinary remark that are considerable; First, it was prophesied by the fiery Mountain <hi>Vesuvius</hi> hard by, and by <hi>Rutilio Bennicasa</hi> an Astrologer; <hi>Vesuvius</hi> gave warning of it som yeers before, for the great <hi>Vorago</hi> or fiery Gulph, of about a mile and a half circuit which rageth in the head of that Mountain, did belch forth greater flakes of fire then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, the ashes wherof fell thick on the streets of <hi>Naples,</hi> and besides caus'd such an Earthquake, that the Vice-roy thought it safer to ly som nights in the fields at the sign of the Moon, then in his Castle: Now these unusuall motions and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorations of fire in <hi>Vesuvius</hi> or Mount <hi>Summa,</hi> hath bin al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes held a presage of som popular Insurrection; Besides, as these <hi>propheticall</hi> effects surpass any humane brain, so did the <hi>naturall</hi> causes of those horrid <hi>Vesuvian</hi> fires transcend the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of <hi>Pliny,</hi> who in searching the causes therof was stifled by the smoak, as <hi>Aristotle,</hi> another of Natures <hi>Secretaries,</hi> was swallow'd by the Sea as he was diving into the causes of the ebbs and tides therof. Touching <hi>Bennicasa's</hi> prediction, his book is extant wherin he punctually fore-tels that ther shold be a horrible popular Sollevation in the year 1647. now, this number <hi>seven</hi> had much to do with this tumult, for it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend in the <hi>seventh</hi> month of the yeer, on the <hi>seventh</hi> day of the month, on the <hi>seventh</hi> hour of the day, in the <hi>seventeenth</hi> month of the Duke of <hi>Arco's</hi> Government, <hi>Masanello</hi> had <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> Secretaries, and as before, it happend in the year sixteen hundred forty <hi>seven.</hi> Moreover it is remarkable how when this Convulsion happend in <hi>Naples,</hi> it diffus'd it self by a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous suddenness to the remotest parts of that <hi>long</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as if it had bin done by intercourse of Spirits, and the news therof transported by a supernaturall way; insomuch that this Commotion may be sayd to be like a great Pond frozen over, where if the Ice break in one place it will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb facs="tcp:96399:4"/>Another thing of remark is, that Doctor <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>iello</hi> the Kings Protophysitian in <hi>Naples</hi> shold make such an operative Figg for the Fisher-man that shold so infatuat him, and by a strange kind of Intoxication make him act <hi>Orlando Furioso.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover it is remarkable, how before this, <hi>Masanello</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving done the work for the peeple, was so modest that he threw away and toar his Cloth of silver Suit, and taking his Fisher-mans Habit again, sayed, that That Profession was less troublesom unto him, as we read of the <hi>Metemphycosist Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras,</hi> who sayd, <hi>That he did lead a merrier life when he was a Frog, then when he was a Philosopher</hi>: This of <hi>Masanello's</hi> may be sayd to be such a <hi>Metemphychosis,</hi> and as there is a trick by subtilty of art to blow up a small Pill of Past to the bignes of a Canon bullet, so by the <hi>puff</hi> of popular <hi>Air, Masanello</hi> may be sayd to have swell'd to that hugeness. Furthermore it is remarkable, that a shower of Musket bullets shold be shot by the <hi>Banditi</hi> at <hi>Masanello,</hi> and none shold have power to penetrat his body.</p>
            <p>Lastly, it is to be admir'd that in so few months after (for the Convulsion did not cease with <hi>Masanello</hi>) there shold be so perfect and bloody a civill War twixt <hi>Naples</hi> and her own Castles, wherin there happen'd above an hundred Skirmiges, above 80000. bullets were shot off from Sea and Castles, &amp; above 2000. from the Citty. It is also worthy of admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion what Reverence the peeple in the rough of their fury did alwaies bear to the Arch-bishop of <hi>Naples</hi> the <hi>Common Father</hi> of the Citty, for had it not bin for him, the whole Town in all probability had bin turn'd to a heap of ashes, which (as a world of examples more might be produc'd) may serve for a pregnant instance to prove, how avaylable to a state the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence of the chief Governors of the Church is, for suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of Uprores; Now, this <hi>Reverence</hi> is to be supported by a stately Gravity and large <hi>Revenues</hi> accordingly, to oblige the peeple, and draw an aw from them by works of Charity; And where this <hi>Revenue</hi> with other kind of <hi>Gartuitie</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fayls; farewell all <hi>Reverence</hi> to the Church.</p>
            <p>In the ensuing Story the Reader shall find all these passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges related, as also an accurat view of the whole Country; He also shall be acquainted with their Kings, amongst whom he shall meet with two more memorable then others;

The natural colour of the people inclines more to white then a swart colour, in reasoning and discoursing they are very stately and disdainfull, and great braggadochios, but very obedient to their supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors.

There groweth Gum, Pitch, Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine, and liquid Storax. In former time it was never without Mettals, but at this present it doth much abound, having in most places divers sorts of Mines, as Gold, Silver, Iron, Marble, Alabaster, Cristal, Marchesite, three sorts of white Chaulk, Virmilion, Alume, Brimstone, and the Adamant stone, which being in the fifth degree, draweth not Iron, and is in colour black. There groweth hemp and slax of two sorts, the one called the male, the other the female: There falleth Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na from heaven, truly a thing very rare; and although there is not gathered such abundance of Silk, yet I dare say there is not had so much in all <hi>Italy</hi> besides. There are also Bathes, both hot, luke-warm, and cold, to cure many diseases. Near the Seaside, and likewise on the Mediterrane are goodly Gardens full of Oringes, Citrons, and Limons of divers sorts, it is watered with many Rivers.

Moreover it falleth out sometimes, that he which roweth is wounded in the boat, so great is the sword of the fish and his fierceness, that this labour is no less dangerous then the chasing of the wild Boar.

The said Temple was spoiled for the riches therein by <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> and by <hi>Dionisius</hi> the Tyrant; and last of all it was robbed by <hi>P. Plemnio</hi> the Roman Legat. Nevertheless they all sustained the punishment of Divine vengeance, the one whilst he went up and down the shore, through fear restored the sacriledg, was afterward slain by <hi>Argus</hi>; the punishment of the other was imposed upon his son, being therefore deprived his Kingdom by God, which often punisheth the sins of fathers in their children, and the other by authority of the Senate died miserably in prison.

                  </gap>h the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ease. <hi>Averroe</hi> was of opinion, and many other besides him, that the Ancients, and especially <hi>Galen,</hi> knew not this manna. Manna falleth in the nights in the Summer season when the air is coldest, and the day before very hot and dry, for the learned interpreters of nature say this proceeds of the light vapours from the earth and the water. Forasmuch as being first purified and concocted by the Sun; it is to be thought that by the cold of the night following it becomes thick. And besides it is to be understood, that that Manna which falls upon fig-leaves, and the Ash is whitest and most gummie; but that which falleth upon the leaves of peaches, of almonds, or oaks, is liquid, and in taste and colour like honey. Therefore we may easily believe, that not by its own nature, or of it self, Manna becommeth gummy, and is made thick like unto mastick; but these accidents cause these effects upon the leaves and trees where it chanceth to fall. Neither is that to be believed which many report thereof, that manna before the canicular daies, sweateth in <hi>Calauria,</hi> without falling from the air, even from boughs, and likewise from the bark of the bodies of the ash and plum-trees, and to be ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred naturally of it self in these trees, and to sweat out of them, in like manner as gum sweateth from divers other trees, wherein they are much deceived; forasmuch as that which sweateth from these trees in the canicular daies, is no other then the celestial manna descending there in the next succeeding months of <hi>May</hi> and <hi>Iune,</hi> sucked up by the bark, and drawn out again in such manner as a man draweth a drop of oyl out of a piece of woollen cloath that is fallen upon it, and so it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

comes to pass, being incorporated with the rine of the tree, issueth out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, drawn by the violent heat of the canicular starr, and is there thickned, and becomes grainy in the manner of gum. It is evidently seen, that that which fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth from the air is better preserved by the ash and the plum-trees, then any other kind of Tree or Plant whatsoever; and therefore it is not to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired if the most sottile and thin part entreth and penetrateth through the pores thereof,<note place="margin">The tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Manna.</note> being there preserved, doth not corrupt in a long time. Manna is (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as <hi>Avicenne</hi> and <hi>Mesue</hi> relates) of an equal temperature, more inclining to heat then otherwise. But according to <hi>Averroe,</hi> it is hot and moist, it loosneth the body, although but weakly by it self alone, and therefore it is given to women with child, and to little children without any hurt or fear; being mingled and wrought with medicines, it increaseth their vertue. It gently and easily purgeth choler, taketh away thirst, openeth and mollifieth the parts of the brest, and of the throat; but it cannot be preserved in the true perfection thereof above one year.

The Stork hath a very long beak, bigg and sharp pointed, and making one of his wings to serve as a buckler, which is very great among the bigg quils thereof, thrusteth his beak in and out, being accompanied with a very long neck, so fiercely pricketh and gripeth his enemy, untill he kill him, and afterward taking him in his mouth carrieth him to his nest, oftentimes flying within the view of the city. And it is to be noted that in this combat was never seen any stork killed by the serpent; whereupon the Dukes have alwaies observed by a penal Act to punish whomsoever killeth any stork, and therefore they live familiarly with them. The Arms of <hi>Gravina</hi> are certain ears of Corn, and bunches of Grapes, to declare how much the Territory thereof aboundeth with these two sorts of fruits, that is to say Corn and Wine, whereupon some think from thence it taketh its name.

This City hath the dignity of a Principality, the Lord thereof is <hi>Don Horatio</hi> of <hi>Noia,</hi> a most generous Knight. Departing from <hi>Sulmona</hi> we come to the River <hi>Aterno,</hi>

                  </note> now called <hi>Pescara,</hi> from the City of <hi>Pescara,</hi> which is very near, built by the ancient City of <hi>Aterno,</hi> from whence the River hath its name.

And it is in the manner of Tarr.</p>
               <p>Being now come to an end of this Province, it remains that I declare somewhat of the Inhabitants. The people of this Country are very tall and strong, and in countenance not much unlike the French Nation; in bargaining with strangers they are simple and courteous, full of courage, and much affected to the professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Arms, wherein they grow to great perfection; they are not very costly in their apparel, but much given to hunting, they are also well inclined to Learning, and apply themselves much to the study of the Law, and Phisick. The Arms be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to this Province, is or. a wild Boars head couped in pale on bas, a yoke in chief gu. noting as I think thereby, the great abundance of wild Hoggs that are therein, and with this, that memorable exploit that chanced between these people and the Romans, as it is before recited; moreover it may be said, that these two charges should signifie the same service, placing the head of the Boar as a fierce and cruel beast, for the arrogancy of the Romans put under the yoke. But I refer my self to better judgment.</p>

The said Citie is in compasse four miles, and without the walls it hath a very pleasant vally of excellent pasture, compassed with trees, and watred with crystalline and fresh Springs, besides the profit which proceeds from the river <hi>Aterno,</hi> which divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it with a pleasing current, yeelds also a great commodity by the Mills. The length of this plain is not above four and twenty miles, and three in breadth; but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where fruitfull. It hath great abundance of all sorts of wood, and plenty of corn, wine, oyl, and every other thing which serveth for the use of living creatures: their Orchards are such as neither through cold, or the heat of Summer they ever fail in yeilding their fruits.

There are in this City an hundred and eleven Churches all richly beneficed; and besides, they have many Reliques of Saints, among the which are the four Protectors of the Citie, carefully and richly kept, and faithfully worshipped. And within a Coffin of silver<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the value of 1800 crowns, is to be seen the body of St. <hi>Bernardino Senesi</hi> of the order of the Minors of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> the first reformer of the regular life of that religion.

I will begin to describe this Countrey from <hi>Campobasso,</hi> a City built in the midst of the Hills, on this side the <hi>Apennine,</hi> from <hi>Boiano</hi> twelve miles distant, for here begins the first countrey of <hi>Puglia.</hi> The said countrey is very populous and rich, from whence the counties of <hi>Campobascio</hi> have had their originall and surname. Going from this countrey towards <hi>Luceria</hi> four miles, is <hi>Campo di Pietra,</hi> which hath a good Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and following that way no more then six miles, appears upon the top of a high hill the Castell <hi>Pietra</hi>; and from hence five miles is <hi>Macchia,</hi> which hath the title of a County. And from <hi>Campobascio</hi> sixteen miles, is the Castle <hi>Celantia,</hi> and from hence seven miles is <hi>Riccia.</hi> opposite to whom is <hi>Gambatesa,</hi> and after eight miles, is the Castell of <hi>Motta</hi>; and a litle higher are these Cities and Castles, St. <hi>Gintiam Coletort, Geldono,</hi> and in the top is <hi>Circo</hi> the great, where the river <hi>Fortore</hi> spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: six miles from thence is <hi>Vinchiaturo,</hi> afterward is <hi>Baronello, Busso, Ratino, Roc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chetta, Montesaggiano,</hi> and following that way neer the river <hi>Fortore</hi> are these Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries and Castles, <hi>Petrella Castel de Lino, Morrone</hi> and <hi>Giovenisso.</hi> Then we come to very large and spacious fields, which continue the space of eighteen miles, even to the sea, and therein are to be seen the ruines of the ancient <hi>Gerione,</hi> so often named by <hi>Livy,</hi> neere whose walls he writeth that <hi>Hanniball</hi> made his stay. Upon the Hills which joyn with the <hi>Apennine,</hi> and are above the fountain of <hi>Vulturno,</hi> on the right hand, are these Castles, <hi>Montenegro, Riofreddo,</hi> and a little below is the Castle <hi>Forolo,</hi> so called also in old time: then coming down by the course of the river three miles, neer <hi>Fornello</hi> is a new countrey, but very populous and rich, which yeilds the best wine in all the countrey: Directly against <hi>Fornello,</hi> there belongs to <hi>Vultur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> a vally called <hi>Porcina,</hi> and then somwhat lower there entreth into <hi>Vulturno,</hi> a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver which comes from <hi>Esernia,</hi> an ancient Colony of the Romans, to which City that learned Lawyer <hi>Andrea</hi> of <hi>Rampino,</hi> called by the Surname of <hi>Esernia,</hi> hath given much honor, whose works are of great estimation with learned men: he was a man of great account, and of the counsell of Queen <hi>Ione</hi> the first, and (as <hi>Liparulo</hi> write<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) was slain by <hi>Currado</hi> of <hi>Gottis,</hi> a Dutch Baron for giving judgment against him. This Citie hath a very fruitfull Territory, and the Citizens for the most part are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in merchandise. Not far off is <hi>Supino,</hi> a fair and an ancient citie, called in old time <hi>Sepinum</hi>; of whom <hi>Pliny</hi> calleth the Inhabiters <hi>Sepinates.</hi> Ascending then towards the <hi>Mediterrane,</hi> within a mile of the river <hi>Fortore,</hi> and eight miles from the sea, is the noble Castle <hi>Guilliniaco,</hi> and as much more higher is <hi>Guardia Alferes,</hi> so named, above the which is <hi>Lupara, Cartabuttaccio,</hi> and <hi>Lucito</hi> which hath a fair and fertile Territory, the Lord thereof is <hi>Alfonso Pescicello</hi> a Neapolitane Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, a generous young man, and wise, and much inclined to learning. And keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on that way, there is to be seen <hi>Limosano, Castelpignano, Rochetta, Casal repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rando,</hi> and <hi>Lespineto</hi> which was repaired by Queen <hi>Ione</hi> the first, by the mediation of <hi>Pietro Cardillo</hi> a Neapolitan, her Favorite.<note place="margin">

this accident. The which <hi>Lorenzo</hi> hearing (which was accounted so religious a man) admiring at so great a miracle, caused the people to fast three dayes, and with many prayers reconciling themselves unto God. The Fast ended, and divine Service solemnly celebrated, the night following St. <hi>Michael</hi> appeared to <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> said unto him: By the will of God, and through my means, it is so come to passe, O <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> that the Bull hath discovered this place chosen by my self, where I desire a Church should be made to my name, that I might have a dwelling upon the earth amongst men: De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to the Citizens, that in this place I am to pardon in the name of God the sins of the people which repair hither. The which vision, after <hi>Lorenzo</hi> had rendered due thanks unto God, he declared it. Then with generall procession and many ceremonies, they went very religiously to the holy cave, where with great devotion they said so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn service, and so to the honor of St. <hi>Michaell</hi> the Archangell, the place was dedicated.</p>
               <p>The Pope understanding thereof sent three Bishops to consecrate the Church, and the Angell appeared again saying, that needed not to be consecrated by humane means, which was consecrated by divine providence, and that in token and sign there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, they should find the print of his foot upon the Altar. The morning following they went in procession, and so finding it, after they had all yeilded due thanks unto God, consecrated another hill hard by, which at this present is called the holy Hill, whither repair infinite people with great devotion on every side. Now not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Neapolitane Army coming to <hi>Seponto,</hi> after it had sack't <hi>Benevento,</hi> the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple betaking themselves to prayer, after they had fasted three days, the night follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Angell appeared in sleep to <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> admonishing him, that the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning he should cause all the people to arm themselves, and to assail their enemies Camp, and he would aid them therein The people beleeving the words of <hi>Loren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zo,</hi> marched with their army into the Fields, and invaded their enemies, upon whom came from heaven even at an instant, so horrible a tempest with lightning and thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that the enemies army was not onely scattered and disperst, but most of them cruelly slain.</p>

of the Kingdom, and Fortresses made for the guard and defence of the Sea are held 1608 footmen ordinarily Spaniards, comprehending also the Officers which remain in the Castles for the service of them. There are also 1020 armed men ranged into 16 companies, that is to say five Spanish, and eleven Italians, 60 men in a company; there are besides reserved for the Viceroy-General of the Kingdom a hundred men, and 80 for the great Constable. But for light-horsmen there is not above 450 ranged into five companies.

Moreover for occurrences in defence of the Kingdom, there is maintained in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of the war an Army of 24078 footmen of the Kingdom, the which hath not been very long since it was ordained, for because that in all the Provinces of the Kingdom there are ordinarily limited five footmen for every hundred Family; these footmen in every Country of the Kingdom are chosen by the Electors of that Country; therefore if the souldiers named do not please their Captains, they ought to chuse others that may content them; these footmen are bound both in the occurrences of the Kingdom, and out of the Kingdom to serve five years, and then in change of them to chuse others. And in the same manner is paid to the said souldiers, to Captains, Ensigns, Sargeants for that time which they serve, the same pay that is given to Spanish footmen and their Officers. These souldiers of this new Army (which together are so named) enjoy certain priviledges of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. The strength of the Kingdom consisteth also in 30 Gallies, with their helps which are 27. but the principal Fortresses are <hi>Naples,</hi> with three Castles, <hi>Gaeta la Mantia, Trani, Cotrone, Gallipoli, Monopoli, Taranto, Bary, Brindesi,</hi> with the Fortress of St. <hi>Andrea, Barletta, Otranto, Manfredonia, Monte de St. Angelo,</hi> and towards the <hi>Mediterrane, Capoa, Cosenza, Catanzaro, Civitella, Aquila.</hi> All the men in general are strong, valorous, painfull, well made, and comely, ingenious, courteous, inclined to piety and vertue, desirous of novelty, litigious, given to pleasure, religious aad devout, the which the many and great magnificence of the Churches, and riches of the Clergy do testifie.

               <p>This manner of receiving of Collections continued untill the time of the most famous and renowned King <hi>Alfonsus</hi> of <hi>Aragon,</hi> who purposing better to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish the affairs of the Kingdom, assembled in <hi>Naples</hi> the 28 day of <hi>February</hi> 1442 a general Parlament, and required that in place of the six Collections, should be levied on every Family ten carlines. And although <hi>Matteo de Afflitto</hi> in the <hi>cap. &amp; plaustorum num</hi> 6. <hi>quae sint reg.</hi> saith that that Parlament was held in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Benevento,</hi> nevertheless in the chapters of the Kingdom, cap. 1. <hi>Regis Alfonsi</hi> appears the contrary, because he saith that the said Parlament was held in <hi>Naples</hi> in the Church of St. <hi>Lorenzo.</hi> In the year following 1449, the 20 of <hi>September</hi> (as it is noted in the Register intituled <hi>Literarum curae secundi anni</hi> 1451. <hi>fol.</hi> 133<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is preserved in the Royal Chamber of the Summary) the said King being in the Greek Tower, caused there a general Parlament to assemble, where the King so propounded, that he maintaining so great an Army, as well by land as sea, to no other end and purpose but to secure and defend the Kingdom from the incursions and invasions of enemies, which neglected no oportunity to prejudice and indanger it, the Royal Revenue of the Kingdom being not sufficient, he was inforced either to increase it, or to give way to the enemy, therefore he had considered that for an universal benefit, it would do well that there should be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed five other Carlines on every Family besides the ten, the which payment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not grievous nor heavy but lawfull and honest, may be easily supported of all: And to the end they may know, it is not our purpose to impose new Taxes, nor through a covetous and greedy desire to heap treasure together, but only to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure them from the Tyranny of others, and therefore at this present I promise to give to every Family of the Kingdom a bushel of salt.</p>
               <p>The King having finished this Speech, they all cryed out with a loud voice,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:96399:61"/>
saying, Whatsoever your sacred Majesty commands shall be done, and in token of faithfull Subjects, since that you have vouchsafed to bestow salt on your most loyal Kingdom, we humbly desire that your sacred Majesty will accept of us in behalf of the whole Kingdom, two grains more for a Family, as a gratification for the said salt, which shall be at the appointment of your Majesties Officers, the which was accepted of the King; the number of which Families as it then appeared in the Royal Taxation, with all the Cities and Countries of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom (except 58<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There are also exempted from the said usual and common payment the Companies which have perpetual free priviledges, which import 41510 duck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, two carlins, and seven grains, the which with the noble City of <hi>Naples,</hi> are in all the Provinces of the Kingdom (as we have before said) in number 54. There are also exempted the Universities which are free for some prefixed time, which pay not the said payments, which import 2609 duckets, eight carlins, and eight grains, the number whereof are but four. They are also excepted which pay by covenant and agreement, which import 23794 duckets eight carlins and three grains, and are 25 companies. Moreover there are exempted many particular men which hold priviledged immunities, which import 1203 duckets, two carlins and five grains. So there is received clearly, exempting the priviledged Universi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, those that are free for a time; and the Universities which pay by covenant, and the priviledged men 654873 duckets, six carlins, and seven grains. This then is the ordinary payment which the King receiveth every year of all the families of the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>There is likewise another ordinary payment called <hi>Adogo,</hi> which signifies royal service, this is payed by the Feudaries in place of personal service, because every one is bound to present himself personally before the King when he goeth to war. At the which service the feudary was bound personally to be ready with his only person, when he possessed an intire fee. It was held an intire fee, when the revenue thereof did amount to 20 ounces, the ounce is 6 duckets,<note place="margin">

And in very truth, although the said feudists contribute their money to the said service of the King, at that time which they paid for the said whole fee of 20 ounces the half, and somewhat more, that is to say ten ounces and a half; yet for all this they shall pay at this present, that is for every hundred duckets of revenue he payeth the half, which are 50 duckets and five graines besides for a ducket more, which are in all 52 duckets and a half, and this payment is meant when the fee consisteth in slaves. But if the fee be without slaves, because the feudist could not have aid or assistance, he ought only to pay six ounces. And if the fee consisteth in money, that is to say in pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal payments, or alienated revenues established, he payeth only five ounces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that revenue may be augmented, as <hi>Isernia</hi> saith in <hi>cap.</hi> 1. <hi>fin. quis dicatur dux, Marchio,</hi> and in the <hi>cap.

For these services then which belong to feudists, are certain slaves, or rather lands to help towards the moyety of the said service held by the Barons at the rate of five car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins a Family, for these Families which the Universities are taxed, if the land consist not of so many Families, which at the rate of five carlins a Family, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth not the moyety of the payment of the said taxation of the Baron, that University or Countrey is not bound to any further charge, but for so many families as are taxed, paying at the rate of five carlins a family, and for that which wanteth the Baron is enjoyned to pay together with some other moiety which he hath. But if the number of Families be so many that the payment of every fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily at the aforesaid rate of five carlins exceed the moity of the contribution which belongs to the University, then that overplus which groweth is to be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded among the Families, to the end that the only moity which belongs to the aid and help of the Baron may be received. Of which <hi>Afflitto</hi> doth very large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly discourse <hi>&amp; in cap. Caroli</hi> 2. which begins <hi>Comites Barones,</hi>

               <p>Afterward the Kingdom came into the Jurisdiction of <hi>Ferdinando</hi> the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick King, who understanding the many contentions and strifes which were in the Kingdome between the Barons and Vassals for the payment of this Imposition of the <hi>Adogo,</hi> to settle things in order, appointed that all the Barons and feudists, with their revenue should be noted, and that all the Cities, and Countries, and Families of the Kingdom should be newly numbred, and ordained that the helps of the moity of the taxations which the vassals paid to the feudists by reason of the Kings service, should be no more received by the feudists, but by the Kings Treasurers and Officers.

               <p>First of all every Family payeth four grains, the which payment is received e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very month.

               <p>There is also an Imposition paid for the wages of the Barigelli of the fields, which are those that guard and keep the high-wayes, and goe against Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laws.</p>
               <p>This Imposition was made by <hi>Don Pietro</hi> of <hi>Tolledo</hi> the third of <hi>August</hi> in the year 1550. only in the Provinces of the Principality on this side and the other, and the County of <hi>Molise, Capatanata,</hi> and <hi>Basilicata,</hi> to avoid the robberies which were daily committed, for which cause were appointed the Universities to pay all those losses which were there committed. It was afterward ordained that the said Imposition should be gathered of all the Provinces except the Land of <hi>Lavero</hi>; but for the service which the said <hi>Barricelli</hi> did in that Province, they

That part which is to be seen lieth in this sort, It hath in the midst an entrie of 200 handsbreadth in length, and 18 in breadth, having on both sides four lodgings vaulted in largeness some 12 and some 16 hands breadth, being between some of them the space of 12 hands breadth, and between others 18. In these spaces are 4 dores, every one the breadth of 12 hands, the one distant from the other 16, except the first distance, which is in the entrance 18. but the other distances be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the said dores are equal.

Of this Hill <hi>Livy</hi> maketh mention in his third book <hi>ab urbe cond.</hi> saying that they sacrificed there in the night. We have written at large thereof in the book of the Antiquities of <hi>Pozzuolo,</hi> whereto I refer the Reader.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lusilla</hi> is a Wood in length three miles, where are very goodly pastures for droves and heards of Cattle. It is distant from <hi>Lusilla</hi> two miles, and a little more from the ancient <hi>Lavo,</hi> called <hi>Laino,</hi> a City of <hi>Calauria</hi> on this side.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Daunia</hi> was in old time a very fair Wood all of Oaks, in the midst whereof was a stately Temple dedicated to <hi>Iupiter Dodon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>o,</hi> whose Statue was very much honoured, because it revealed things by the means of a Pidgeon. This Wood stood in <hi>Puglia,</hi> and was so called of <hi>Dauno</hi> the son of <hi>Pilumno,</hi> and of <hi>Da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Sila,</hi> called for the excellency thereof, <hi>Sila Brettiana,</hi> is a very fair Wood, which contains 200 miles in compass, and standeth near <hi>Cosenza,</hi> a City of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lauria</hi> on this side; this famous Wood is not so hideous and loathsome in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, through the continual snow and ice, as it is pleasant and delightful in Summer, where the fresh air with delicate streams of water full of fish, the sundry parts in fowling and hunting, the infinite droves and heards of cattel which plentifully feed, represent in effect that which the Poets feign of their <hi>Arcadia.</hi> In this Wood are Trees which yield Pitch and excellent Turpentine, whereof <hi>Strabo</hi> in his 6 book thus saith,
<q>Est Syla picis, ferax optime Brettiana dicta proceris arboribus &amp; aquis recentibus r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ferta ad <hi>97</hi> longitudinis.</q>
Of this <hi>Sila, Virgil</hi> maketh mention in the 12 book, saying,
<q>
                     <l>Ac velut ingenti Syla, summove Taburno.</l>
                     <l>Cum duo conversis inimica in praelia tauri</l>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dioscorides</hi> in his first book doth much commend the Pitch which comes from thence, and <hi>Galen</hi> also doth greatly praise it in his book <hi>de Antido.</hi> and in the 3 <hi>de copia medicamentorum,</hi> and in other places; it is also commended by <hi>Paulo Agine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> in the third book <hi>de arte medendi,</hi> of <hi>Aetio</hi> in the fifteenth book of <hi>Pliny,</hi>

               <head>Of the Coronation of the Kings of NAPLES.</head>
               <p>I Have thought it a thing very fit and convenient, having declared what the Kings were of this noble and renowned kingdom, to receive also the manner and the ceremony which is used in the time of their coronation. But before I proceed any further, it is to be understood, that there are but only four Kings that are crowned and anointed by the order of the Pope, as is noted in the Records of the Roman Church, the which <hi>Alberico de Rosato</hi> also confirmeth, which are these following, the King of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> the King of <hi>France,</hi> the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> commonly called <hi>Sicilia,</hi> and the King of <hi>England.</hi> All the rest are crowned by their Archbishops or Bishops by a certain custome. The Emperour is anointed and crowned in the same manner as are the said four Kings, and therefore all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Kings are called by the name of <hi>Highness,</hi> and not <hi>Majesty,</hi> except those that are annointed by the order of the Pope, as is said. In the coronation then of the King of <hi>Naples</hi> the Pope sendeth a Cardinall his Legate, or a Patriarch, but he must have holy Orders, because the said Legate not having the said holy Orders, another ought to come which hath the said dignity. There also assembles (according to the accustomed manner) all the Archbishops of the kingdome, which crown this Prince with the greatest pomp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and state that may be done to any Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an King. The principall thing before the King taketh this dignity, the seven Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the kingdom, which are seven principall secular Lords, that meet together at this coronation, are cloathed in Purple, lined with Ermins, with very rich attires up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their heads, and repair together with the Recorder of the Citie into the Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drall Church of <hi>Naples,</hi> where is the ancient Tomb of <hi>Charls</hi> of <hi>Angio,</hi> which was the first that was crowned with an Imperiall crown,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Charls</hi> of <hi>Angio</hi> was the first that was crowned with an Imperiall Crown, King of both the Sicilles.</note> and invested King of both the <hi>Sicilles</hi> and <hi>Ierusalem</hi>; and there the Apostolike Legate, with the other Archbishops pontifically clothed with Miters and Rochets, and the other Prelats in Purple Vest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, attend the Kings coming at the Church Dore. Afterward when the King cometh that is to be crowned, he entreth into the said Church, accompanied with all the Princes, Dukes, Marqueses, Earls, Barons and Lords of the kingdom, and the Legat suddenly kissing his forehead, receiveth him, and saith unto him with an high and intelligible voyce these words,<note place="margin">The Kings of Naples are written sacred Royal Majesty. See the Gloss in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ambles of the Constitution of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in the second colum.</note> 
                  <hi>I am come by the appointment of the supream Bishop Pope</hi> N. <hi>to crown thee King of Naples and Ierusalem.</hi> After the Archbishop with the other, that have charge to say Service in the said Church, receive the King at the Altar, and there causing him to kneel down, and after is made by the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of <hi>Naples,</hi> of <hi>Capoa,</hi> and of <hi>Salerno,</hi> devout prayers for his Majesty, one of the Bishops demandeth of him in Latin, if he will promise to maintain always the Faith and Christian Religion? Defend the Widows, the Fatherless, and the Poor? Establish the kingdom, and minister justice to every one? And last of all, if he will always yeild due honor to the supream Bishop? To all which things the King an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering, <hi>He will,</hi> two Archbishops take him by the arm, and lead him to the Altar, where he solemnly sweareth to observe all that which the Archbishop hath demanded of him. This done, the Archbishop of <hi>Naples</hi> demandeth with a loud voyce of all the Princes, if they will promise loyalty and service to his Majesty? Where being answered by all, <hi>That they will very willingly.</hi> Then two Archbishops lead him into the Vestry, and being there apparelled with Sandalles, richly set with Jewels and Pearls, with a Surplice like a Minister, and a Cope, lead him again to the Altar, and saying certain prayers, the Cardinall Legate accompanied with the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops, rising from their seats with Miters on their heads, go unto him, and finding the King kneeling, with a loud and solemn prayer recommend him unto God, in whose hands are all Empires, that it would please him to make his kingdom stable and perpetuall, replenished with victory, piety, and honor. The King remaining on his knees, one of the Archbishops goeth to the Altar, and beginneth the Letany, and devoutly prayeth for his Majesty, the Archbishop of <hi>Naples,</hi> with the rest of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops

undoing his Surplis, with certain zealous prayers, anoint his shoulders and his right arm, to signifie, that he sustaineth the burthen of the affairs of the kingdom,<note place="margin">What the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing of the Kings shoulders and right arm sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie.</note> and draweth his sword for the conservation thereof: And moreover, the Royall purple Robe reaching down even to his foot, lined with fables, and richly embrode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with gold and pearl, signifieth Charity. That done, he still remaining in devout meditation, the Apostolick Legat standing, the King kneeling before him, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth into his hand the golden Scepter, all wrought in the top with Pearls and Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, wherewith religiously he commands the people.<note place="margin">The Royall purple Rob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This being done the 15 of July, the Christians bestowed eight whole days in visiting the holy Sepulcher, and other sacred aad religious places. After this they advanced the said <hi>Godfrey</hi> by a generall consent and decree to the Royall Throne, who accepting the dignity and government of the said citie, yet utterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused to be crowned, saying, It was not fit for him to wear a crown of gold, when the King of Kings had but one of thorns. This good King reigning but one whole year, what through the toil and labour of the passed war, or the distemperature of the air, died of a Fever, and was buried with generall lamentation in the sacred Temple of that most holy Sepulcher, in that very place of <hi>Calvary</hi> where Christ our Redeemer was crucified. This <hi>Godfrey</hi> was the first who for his Ensign or Arms of the said kingdom had not a Cross, (as commonly it was supposed) but a name abbre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viated by two great Letters in a field Ar<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which letters were an H with this let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

The Count understanding this, fuming thereat, being incensed with rage, and envying the prosperity of <hi>Guy,</hi> made peace with <hi>Salandine</hi> King of the <hi>Sarasins,</hi> promising to aid him against King <hi>Guy.</hi> The <hi>Salandine</hi> being now at peace with the Christians, found opportunity by the discord of these Princes to break it; because the Christian Prince of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reale,</hi> which governed the countrey from that to the river <hi>Iordan,</hi> being on every side inhabited with <hi>Sarasins</hi> who continually carried their commodities to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> without the Kings knowledge, suddenly brake the truce; for the <hi>Salandine</hi> saw the time was now come which he long expected, assembled together fifty thousand Horsmen, and an infinite company of Footmen without number, and got many cities of the Christians, and increasing their Army with the people of the countrey, took <hi>Ierusalem</hi> by covenant after they had besieged it one moneth.

Afterward he went to <hi>Tolomayda</hi> and besieged it, wherein was the King and <hi>Sybel</hi> his wife, with four children, who with the children died together of a bloody flux. Now (as we have said before) was promised to <hi>Erfrando</hi> of <hi>Turon</hi> Master of the <hi>Rhodes,</hi> a noble young man, <hi>Isabel</hi> to wife, the sister of <hi>Sybel,</hi> a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, and also the daughter of <hi>Baldwin</hi> the fourth, and sixth King of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> who now by the death of <hi>Sybel</hi> was next heir to her Fathers kingdom.

                  <head>High Constable.</head>
                  <p>THere are seven principall or chief Offices in the kingdom, The first whereof is, the <hi>Great</hi> or <hi>High Constable,</hi> who stands in place of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, or the Kings Lieutenant in the wars which happen in the kingdom; and in such a case orders and provides for all such things as belong to the Militia. This Office lasts as long as the war: And when the King creates such a one, he puts a golden Truncheon in his hand saying, Take this sacred Truncheon in thy hand to drive away and keep back the enemies and opposers of my people. And this word <hi>Constable,</hi> much used amongst <hi>Tuscan</hi> Writers, did anciently signifie a Captain of a quantity of Cavallery. But in process of time by Constable was meant a Commander of Foot-Soldiers, the Captains of Horse beginning to be called <hi>Conductors. Bembo</hi> in his Latin History calls the Constable <hi>Centurion of Soldiers.</hi> In the kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> the office of Constable signified not onely a Captain, but one of far greater authority, it being of the seven offices the greatest: And as it hath been always conferred upon great Lords, so we see it at this day setled upon the person of <hi>N.</hi> He by right commands all Martiall persons, as well afoot as on hors-back; And in Royall Parliaments sits next the King on his right hand. <hi>Pontanus</hi> in the fourth book of his History of <hi>Naples</hi> speaking of the office of the Constable, refused that word as too base and abject, and not Roman, and so named him in Latin <hi>Magnus militiae Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> the great Master of the Militia. Some would liken the office of great Constable to the <hi>Praefectus Praetorio,</hi> yet there seems to be a difficulty in it, seeing the <hi>Praefectus Praetorio</hi> was always created out of the Knightly order, which Rule is not observed in the High Constable who is alwayes selected from among the greatest and most illustrious Barons of the Kingdom, I believe their opinion was grounded upon this, that the <hi>Praefectus Praetorio</hi> was next to the Prince a supream office, depending upon none else, over all the Militia, just as the high Constable is amongst us; he hath 219<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <div type="section">
                  <head>High Admirall.</head>
                  <p>THe <hi>High Admirall</hi> is the second Office of the kingdom: And though the <hi>Great Iustice</hi> have pretended to have the second place; yet there arising many years ago, a controversie for precedencie between the Duke of <hi>Somma,</hi> high Admirall, and the Duke of <hi>Amalfi</hi> chief Justice, and the question being, which of them should at that time precede, it was thus judged, That for the present the Duke of <hi>Somma</hi> as high Admirall, should precede the chief Justice, and this was done in a summary kind of judgment: for the Viceroy who was at that time, having called to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the Regents before he went to the Chappell on a Sunday morning, he caused this question to be resolved standing, so far that the Usher was commanded to say, That his Excellency commanded the High Admirall should go before the chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, not debarring howsoever the chief Justice of any reasons which he might here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after alledge for himself. Signior <hi>Agnolo</hi> of <hi>Costanzo</hi> told me that one of those
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:96399:104"/>
Regents being called by the Viceroy that very morning wherein he had commanded the Usher to publish that Order, had told him they were moved to give sentence on the high Admirals behalf; because there was a very ancient Record sound in the Kings Chancery, by which it plainly appeared, that in a Parliament held in the time of <hi>Charls</hi> the third, King of <hi>Naples, Thomas Marzano</hi> Count of <hi>Squillace,</hi> high Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall, preceded <hi>Rogger Acclocciamuro</hi> chief Justice. And this Record is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise made mention of by <hi>Martin Frezza</hi> in his first book <hi>de Subseudis</hi> pag. 54. <hi>num.</hi> 35. And though in the Parliament held by King <hi>Alphonso</hi> in <hi>Benevento,</hi> they seemed to sit in another order, yet because there was no authenticall Record thereof extant, as of that of <hi>Charls</hi> the third, judgement was given on the high Admirals side; and so much the rather, because it seems to be very just, that the Generall of the Sea, who is the Admiral, should immediatly follow the Land Generall, which is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable. This Office alone, of all the other seven, retains to this hour its jurisdiction, which all the rest have lost. And from this also hath been taken away the General<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of the Gallies of the kingdom, though there yet belongs unto him a very large jurisdiction both in <hi>Naples</hi> and elswhere through all the kingdom; over all those which any way by industry live upon the trade of the Sea. The great Court of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty hath its name of <hi>Great,</hi> even just as that of the <hi>Vicaria,</hi> and its Tribunall is governed by one or more Judges, according to the high Admirals pleasure. He chuses his Lieutenant, who carries in his hand the staff of Jurisdiction, as the Regent of the <hi>Vicaria</hi> doth: And he as well as the Judge, hath a place in the Royall Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, next to the last Judge of the Civill <hi>Vicaria,</hi> as <hi>Frezza</hi> saith, <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>pag.</hi> 432. <hi>num.</hi> 23. He may likewise appoint fifty men for the guard of his person, with fifty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stables on Horseback, and 25 <hi>Commensali,</hi> or fellow Boorders, and other persons, as is contained in his priviledges, which may go armed in the Citie of <hi>Naples,</hi> and all the kingdom over with any manner of Arms, though they be prohibited by the law. He hath also all his houshold Officers, and such Officers also as belong to his Court. He appoints in every Sea-town a Vice-Admirall, a Register, and two Marshals: and in every Province a Provinciall Vice-Admirall with six Marshals, and all subject to his jurisdiction. All shipwracks either of Infidels or unknown masters are his. When he purposes to keep Court for execution of justice, he sets up his Flag, hath a Captain of the guard, and his Marshals. His stipend is, besides six Duckets a day, which all the other six Officers have, which comes every year to 2160 Duckets; every moneth a hundred Duckets as he is Generall of the Sea: He hath for every Bark or Boat, a Carline, by reason of their Pennons which are certain little Flaggs with the high Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirals Arms upon them, which every master of Boat or Bark is bound to carry by his Lanthorn, none can put any vessels to sea against the Infidels without his license, for which he is to pay a certain rate; and of the prizes also when any are taken, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs a share to the high Admirall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He hath also all the bodies of the vessels which are taken, with other pledges, and those which by chance are sunk in the sea; he hath also I know not how many barrows of Salt of the old measure for his house provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. He pays no Custome or Toll, nor gives no account for any thing he exports out of the kingdom by sea, though others pay for such things. He hath moreover ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many other prerogatives and preheminencies, which may be read in the Orders of the Office of the high Court of Admiralty, which for brevity I omit, of which to this day the high Admirall is possessed.</p>

He hath moreover from the Royall Court 24 Bushels of Salt, and 36 fine Sugar-loaves every year.

He hath moreover the emoluments of the Students which come to the Doctors of the Law, and of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick, which are worth some 2000 Duckets a year.

               <p>FIrst of all, before I declare how many, and who be the intituled Lords of this famous kingdom, I esteem it a thing very convenient briefly to set down (forasmuch as the quality of the matter so requireth) the differences of the Crowns which they use: And although many excellent Lawyers have written thereon, nevertheless (as I have said) the subject thereof so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring, I think it fit to discourse something thereof, the better to satisfie the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and to leave nothing unperfect.<note place="margin">

Whereupon to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose we find, that <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great took from his head the Diadem, to put it upon <hi>Lysimacus,</hi> who whas therewith wounded in the forehead, the which accident was prognosticated by the future reign of <hi>Lysimacus.</hi> And that <hi>Pompey</hi> surnamed the Great, was envied because he did wear a wreath upon his knee, for a certain hurt that did much offend him, as though he would aspire to the kingdom of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now concerning the use of this crown according to the modern custome, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours and Kings which descended from the Romans, were wont to send to those whom they exalted to any Royall dignity, a crown in token of honor.

In this manner also were together with the power annexed the demonstrations of Regall or Princely fortune, of the which demonstrations of honor they participating more or lesse, the which did participate more or lesse of Kingly fortune, from thence proceeded the use of Crowns and Chaplets, signifying Royall or Princely dignity, or the honor of a Duke, or Lordly power &amp; autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, because that the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire being fallen from the greatness therof, and Barbarians coming into <hi>Italy,</hi> who like the inundation of a mighty river, carrieth with it infinite damage, replenished unfortunate <hi>Italy</hi> with their bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish manners; whereupon miserably fell to the earth, not onely the beauty of the Roman tongue, and the perfection and propriety thereof, but all that semblance and similitude of the ancient customes, and new titles, new fashions, and new lawes were intruded: the word Prince was taken for a new kind of dignity, which being inferior to a King, and Imperiall preheminence, taketh the precedence of Dukes,<note place="margin">

                  </note>The which fashion, although it be now decayed, I have thought good to declare, to the end the truth thereof may be known, The first title of a Duke in this kingdom, was that of <hi>Benevento,</hi> instituted in the year 573. But after they came under the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction of the King, the first being not descended of Princely blood, was <hi>Francis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co del Balzo</hi> (as hath been said) made Duke of <hi>Andri,</hi> by Queen <hi>Ione</hi> the first. Not long after was <hi>Iacobo Marzano,</hi> made Duke of <hi>Sessa</hi> by King <hi>Ladislaus,</hi> and so others from time to time, whereof the number at this present is very great. This dignity of a Duke increased to a very high and eminent degree, the which chanced not to any of the other aforesaid dignities, because <hi>Charls</hi> the 8. King of <hi>France</hi> being possest of this kingdom, created <hi>Giliberto</hi> of <hi>Borbona</hi> Earl of <hi>Montpensier</hi> his Lieutenant Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall of the kingdom Archduke of <hi>Sessa,</hi>

                  </note> and so the said <hi>Borbana</hi> afterward caused to be set upon his Arms a great purple cap, garnished with a golden hoop, set full of pretious stones, with certain points without pearls in the top, but onely put in the sides thereof, to the end the dignity of a Prince might have its place, and that he also might be known for an Archduke.</p>

And here it is to be noted, that they are not pointed in that manner as some of them have formerly used, that is to say, after that fashion, as their ancestors have had them, because they as they were free Lords, and acknowledged not any superior, (as before hath been declared in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of the principality on this side) might lawfully do it; the which is now other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, the kingdom being under the dominion and jurisdiction of Kings.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>FOR compleating the History of</hi> Naples, <hi>I will take my</hi> rise <hi>from a</hi> High-ground,, <hi>from that Heroick Prince</hi> that Top of men, CARLOS Quinto; <hi>who was the first of the Austrian Family, that saluted in person the fair</hi> Parthenope, <hi>and mounted the</hi> Napolitan <hi>Courser. From him we will go regularly on, and draw the thred of the Story to his Great Grand-child</hi> Philip <hi>the fourth now</hi> Regnant.</p>
               <p>THE Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, is famous for divers high Feats of Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity and Prudence, but the greatest and <hi>difficultest</hi> Exploit that ever he did, the most <hi>signal</hi> Victory that ever he obtained through-out the whole course of his life which had bin so active, was that Conquest he made of <hi>Himselfe,</hi> when he brought his <hi>passions</hi> and height of spirit to be so succumbent and <hi>co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Charles</hi> the Emperour did this, when he had but newly finished the eleventh Lustre of his Age, being then not 56. yeers old; nor did he thus controll him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, by abandoning the pomp and glory of this life, and avoiding publick care, that he might retire to a Country House of pleasure, to hawk and hunt, or use such pastimes, but he remov'd from so many Thrones to enter himself into a Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery (or Hermitage rather) that by that reclus'd life he might sequester himself from all mundane negotiations and delights, to have more vacancy, not only to study the <hi>Theory</hi> of <hi>Mortification,</hi> but put it in <hi>practise:</hi> Besides this reason he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clard at his <hi>Resignation,</hi> that he was now weary of the incombrances of worldly affairs, wherewith he had bin laden so many yeers, for which he was becom now unweldly in regard of Age, as also being afflicted with frequent fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Upon crushing of this <hi>Aragonian</hi> Cocatrice in the shell, there was a monstrous strange <hi>Hydra</hi> engendred in <hi>France</hi> with I cannot tell how many heads: The <hi>Huguenots</hi> began to be potent and turbulent there, the Queen-mother <hi>Katherine de Medicis,</hi> with the <hi>Guisards</hi> were great <hi>Bigots,</hi> and abhorring that faction, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing most fervent in the advance of the Roman cause, they made war against the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> upon those grounds; Therupon <hi>Philip</hi> being the Catholick King, could do no less in the quarrell of the holy Church then reach his Arme and assist them which he did, by sending order to the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> his Governour in <hi>Flanders</hi> to that end, who accordingly rusht into <hi>France</hi> and pursued his march as far as the walls of <hi>Paris:</hi> At his entrance into <hi>France</hi> he repaird to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrall Church of <hi>Meaux</hi> where he protested and solemnly swore, that he came to <hi>France</hi> with that Army (which consisted of 10000. foot and 3000. horse) to no other intent but to deliver the oppressed friends of the King (then under minority) from the violence of <hi>Rebells</hi> and <hi>Heriticks,</hi> in which quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell he wold expose his person to any perils whatsoever, and he knew every soul under the Banners of his Catholike Majesty which were in this Army wold do the like: Having receivd this speciall command and knowledg of his sayd Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties pleasure accordingly: This intricat and mysterious War calld the <hi>Ligue</hi> lasted by intermissions in <hi>France</hi> above thirty yeers, and it came to such a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity of Interests that every Province became Frontire to one another, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that that gallant &amp; entire compleat Kingdom was like to be cut into frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments &amp; cantonizd.

               <p>After a little breathing from beating the Turk in <hi>Barbary,</hi> he had opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to meet him at <hi>Malta,</hi> which being besiegd by <hi>Solyman,</hi> he sent to his Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicily</hi> to make what strength they could to assist the <hi>great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> and Knights of that noble Order; The Siege provd very obstinat for four months and the Canons played upon the walls of <hi>Malta</hi> incossantly, which bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terd som of them down to the ground, destroyed multitudes of houses, killd within the Town 7000. of all ages and Sexes, with 2000.

               <p>The next yeer he sent Sea and Land Forces towards the <hi>Luzones</hi> Ilands which ly the South-east, which had bin discoverd by <hi>Magellan</hi> before.

               <p>But this mis-fortune was inferior to that which hapned three yeers after, which was in 1574. when <hi>Aluch-Ali</hi> that famous Turkish Generall came with a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable Army to the coasts of <hi>Barbary,</hi> wherwith he made himself Master of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letta</hi> and <hi>Tunis,</hi> wher above 200. peeces of Ordinance were found, which the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy made prize of with other rich Booties; they destroyed all the Churches and Monasteries, except the great Church which was preservd by a ransom of money.</p>
               <p>This crowd of Disasters ushering in one another, besides that costly and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote War in <hi>Flanders,</hi> might in any mans judgment, have daunted the spirits of King <hi>Philip,</hi> who before had bin so long habituated to good success, for as the morall Philosopher tells us, <hi>Miserum est fuisse felicem,</hi> One of the worst kind of unhappiness is to have bin happy; but he was a Prince of a marvailous aequani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and temper, one who had long studied the mutable condition and lubrici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of this world, insomuch that these crosser traverses did rather heighten his mind then depress it; for not long after he riggd a mighty Fleet upon a great Dessign, no less then for the conquest of <hi>England,</hi> which he thought to swallow at a bit, which shews that neither his spirits nor treasure was wasted, notwithand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the vast expences in the <hi>Flemmish</hi> Wars, and so many millions that he buried in building the <hi>Escuriall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ground of this hardy Enterprize upon <hi>England,</hi> was that he had receivd divers Indignities and his Subjects much <hi>damage</hi> from his Sister Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> though for his part he ever since the death of his wife Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> forbore to do any thing that might displease her, during his aboad in <hi>England,</hi> he had don her such signall and high favors, as to preserve her head from the Scaffold, to have her allowance enlargd, to divert her Sister from a design she had to send her beyond Sea to be a Nun; and at his departure from <hi>England</hi> he desired not to carry with him but one Ring of 100 l. price, nor demanded he any thing of his wifes moveables after her death: And lastly he had shewed no small love for comprehending the surrendry of <hi>Calais</hi> to the English in his treaty of peace with <hi>France</hi>; But in lieu of these Plums he gave her, she threw the stones at him, by assisting <hi>Don Antonio</hi> the Bastard, against him about the Title of <hi>Portugal,</hi> by fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting his own naturall Subjects against him, in the revolt of the confederat Provinces, as far as to send a Governor of her own amongst them, by giving commissions to rob him in the Indies, by intercepting som of his treasure in her own Seas going to <hi>Flanders,</hi> by wronging som of the <hi>Haus</hi> Towns who were under his protection: These with sundry lucitements more, causd <hi>Philip</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare this powerfull Fleet to be quit with her at once for all old Scores, and if all things had fallen right in the intended conjuncture, ther was proportion enough of strength (to speak without flattery) that might in all probability have subdued <hi>England</hi>; for ther were 130.

               <p>The first thing he did was the sending of a new Vice-roy to the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> then, after that long destructive War in the Nether-lands which had so ragd in his Fathers time, he made a Truce with the Hollanders, but in these am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous words <hi>son contento de tratar con vos otros como con Estados libres,</hi> I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to treat with you as with free States, wherby according to the Spanish ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of those words, he intimated they were no free States, by vertu of this

word <hi>As,</hi> for it is a rule in Logic, that <hi>Nullum simile est Idem.</hi> No thing that is like a thing is the same thing; therfore if he treated with them <hi>as</hi> with free States, they were no free States: This Truce afforded much matter of discourse for the Criticks of those times.</p>
               <p>He did this by the advice principally of the Marquess of <hi>Denia</hi> afterwards Duke of <hi>Lermanhom</hi> whom he took for his <hi>Privado</hi> or his <hi>Favorit,</hi> to whom he transmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the guidance of all great affairs being conscious of som imbecillities of his own, wherin he discoverd a great point of wisdom, whose chiefest part is for one to know his own infirmities and incapacities.</p>
               <p>But I should have spoken first of the peace he had made with <hi>England,</hi> which preceded this, and was the first great action he did, when he began to sit at the Healm of that mighty Vessell; I mean the Spanish Monarchy, which in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers time had b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Henry</hi> the fourth of <hi>France</hi> sent him also intelligence tending to that end. So in a short time the Country was rid of them, as it was formerly of the Jewes, in the time of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sabella</hi>; But there were som incommodities followd, for <hi>Spain</hi> was much depopu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated and impoverisht hereby, specially for Corn and other Vegetals, for those <hi>Moriscos</hi> were an industrious people, &amp; wold grub up Corn and Pulse with other things, out of the tops of those craggy Hills wherwith <hi>Spain</hi> is bunchd in most places, so that the Spaniard who naturally is slothfull unless it be in the Wars (as the Turks are) had nothing to do, but having put on his Sword and swelling

               <p>
                  <hi>Philip</hi> the third having as formerly it was spoken, concluded a peace with <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and a Truce with the Dutch, passd most part of his Raign in quietness, which suted best with his disposition, he being a Prince wholly devoted to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises of piety, being alwaies fingring his Beads; He sympathizd in nature much with <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth of <hi>England,</hi> but was not so infortunat as he, for he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servd what his Father left him, wheras the other lost <hi>France</hi> where he had bin Crownd King in his Cradle. And this happiness of <hi>Philip</hi> may be imputed to the sage conduct of the Duke of <hi>Lerma,</hi> who was a sound and well-weighd Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister of State, of a <hi>Debonnair</hi> and affable deportment quite contrary to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius of his Successor <hi>Olivares</hi> who was of a rough rigid humor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Philip</hi> the third after he had reignd 23. yeers died, as he lived in a sweet peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able way, and he was called <hi>Philip el Bueno, Philip</hi> the good, as his Father was calld <hi>Philip</hi> the prudent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Philip</hi> the third to pay his Fathers Creditors, and disburden the Crown of those vast Arrears wherwith it was most heavily laden, in regard of so many Irons he had to beat all his life-time, was forcd to inhance the Gabels, and lay new impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions, as in other places so specially in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi>: Now those who cut out <hi>Philip</hi> the second most work to do, were <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> Queen of <hi>England,</hi> the one was sayed to play the Barber and shave him, which <hi>Harry</hi> did so nimbly and dextrously as if he had bin born to the Trade, and old <hi>Bess</hi> held the Bason while he washd <hi>Philips</hi> head and face, but it was given out that he did this without Camphire Ball, or any Soap at all, but with stale Ly and strong standing Urine.</p>
               <p>There was about that time a witty Italian Author, whose fancies are fresh to this day, who being no friend to the Spaniard, writ many things by way of drol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery against his mode of Government in <hi>Sicilie, Milan</hi> and <hi>Naples,</hi> specially in the <hi>last</hi>; And as he descants upon the Servitude which that wavering and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton people were reducd unto, for their so frequent Sollevations and Revolts, he sayeth, that to punish with som severity the Napolitans for thier infidelity and murmurings against their former Kings, it pleasd the Majesty of the heavenly Judg to deliver them into the hands of <hi>Pharo</hi> to receive law from him, meaning the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who having felt the pulse of that luxurious people, by his interior Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet councell, was advisd that there was no better way to preserve <hi>Naples</hi> in a constancy of obedience, then to bring down the flesh, and tame that hot metteld, and spirited Horse or Courser which she gave for her Ensign: therupon there were appointed Riders, Grooms, Smiths, and others to look to him, and break him, they found that he was so wanton that he wold hardly receive Bit, Bridle, or Saddle, that he was of a mighty strength, therfore it was fitting so pamperd an Animal shold be brought low and mortified: Somthing was don in <hi>Charles</hi> the fift's time to this purpose, but his Son <hi>Philip</hi> did finish the work, who had almost rid him quite of his legs; insomuch that at the beginning of <hi>Philip</hi> the thirds Raign, there was a speciall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:96399:119"/>
Therfore the grave members of the Junta appointed that the Rack shold be raisd a span higher, and that the third part of his Provender shold be taken off.</p>
               <p>When this hapned, their chancd to be present in the <hi>Piazza,</hi> som learned men and Philosophers, who resenting much, and taking to heart that wofull Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, out of pure pitty askt the Junta how they could find in common compassion, which obliges every one to be good to his beast, to diminish the Nutriment of that poor Animal, who was so wasted and worn away, that there scarce remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any thing of him but flesh and bone; The oldest man of the Junta gave a short answer to the sayed Philosophers, telling them that they shold do better to attend their own calling, to dispute of Entities and Quiddities, then to intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with politicall matters, wherin they seemd to be such Simpletons: For in case that Caprichious beast were usd better, he wold quickly repay their mildness with biting &amp; kicks, as he had most ingratefully usd som of his former Riders who were so open handed unto him, divers of whom he had thrown of into ditches, by his excess of mettle, and if one shold mend his commons that instable Animal wold foam at the mouth as much as ever, and raise tumults and seditions against his benefactors and keepers: Therfore whosoever will enter into an exact and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious ponderation of things and of the tru Mode wherby that flouncing Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal shold be kept, he must not look upon the meagernes of his belly, or buttocks, but upon the mischievous quality of his genius, who is still as caprichious a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of novelty as ever he was: Therfore wo be to the Catholic King if that fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocious Napolitan Horse shold have strength and opportunity to put in executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what he doth incessantly cast and chymerize in his own brain against the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent government; Therfore if any thing be to be complaind of it proceeds from the ill nature of the beast, rather then the severity of the Spaniards; nor can any deny but it is a high point of wisdom, &amp; no less of charity with well weighd coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels and prudent artifices to take of by way of prevention the means of doing ill from him who alwaies intends mischief, and is not capable to judg when one doth use him well and do him courtesies, insomuch that there is no medicament can cure the chanchrous humours of the Napolitan, then by applying therunto som corrosives of the Spanish severity.</p>
               <p>The same Author proceeds further<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and fains that <hi>Almansor</hi> King of <hi>Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> meeting casually with the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> they joyntly condole their calamitous condition of servitude causd by the tyranny of the Spaniards, as they walkd and mingld speech a good while together, <hi>Almansor</hi> observd the fashion of that Chain which the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> carried on his legs, because it lookd like a Morisco Manufacture, and surely he had seen and handled that Chain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, so looking neer upon it, he struck his breast in a kind of astonishment, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he was well aquainted with that Chain, for it was the very same wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he and his Antecessors the Morisco Kings had kept most of the Kingdoms of <hi>Spain</hi> the space of seven hundred yeers and upwards in obedience and servili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, therfore he earnestly desired to know how, by whom, and when <hi>Naples</hi> had got on that Chain.</p>
               <p>The Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> answered, a most excellent memory hast thou King <hi>Almansor,</hi> for this unhappy Chain which I carry was brought first from <hi>Spain</hi> by <hi>Gonsaluo de Cordova</hi> calld the great Captain, therfore it is very likely that it is the same you speak of; and now it is above an age passd, I mean a Century of sad Winters that I am fallen into such a deplorable kind of slavery, wherof I know not whether I shall ever rid my self, because I find that the Spaniard is mounted to such a height of power that it hath made me loose all hopes I should have in the arme of man for recovery of my lost liberty, it is the only omnipotent hand of God can do it, by doing such another miracle as he did in the Red Sea.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Almansor</hi> replyed, the calculation falls pat you speak of, for it was about the very same time that the Spaniard shook off the Chain wherwith you go now bound; but let it not be uncouth unto thee most noble <hi>Naples,</hi> to relate how it was possible that the Spaniard shold impatronize himself so easily of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom so far distant from him by Sea and Land: <hi>Naples</hi> rejoynd, It was by fraud that the Spaniard introducd himself to <hi>Italy,</hi> for by pure force he could never

                  <hi>Alphonso</hi> my King to draw on his last, and my principall ruine, gave <hi>Isabel</hi> his Neece (for I will take the rise of my Relation from this unlucky Marriage) to <hi>Iohn Galeazzo</hi> Duke of <hi>Milan</hi> in marriage; In regard of the stupidity of <hi>Iohn Lodwick Sforza</hi> occupied the state of his Nephew, King <hi>Alfonso</hi> as nature obligd him thought to prevent that usurpation, <hi>Lodwick</hi> knowing well that he could not com to the end of his aimes without the destruction of my Kings, took a precipitat resolution to call in the French for the Conquest of me, an action which afterwards prov'd so funestous to all <hi>Italy</hi>: My Kings therupon to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbalance <hi>France,</hi> had recourse to that holy Soul <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of <hi>Aragon</hi> their Cosen, who shewd himself so loving a Kinsman, and faithfull Confederat, that in lieu of chasing away the <hi>French</hi> he parted stakes with them, and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded me amongst them, but afterwards they fell out like Dogs about a bone, and <hi>Ferdinand</hi> made the French find their way again ore the Alps to repass shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to their Country; so <hi>Ferdinand</hi> made himself my absolute Soveraign, and without any scruple of conscience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and for my kind invitation he was the first who gave me this Chain you see, which as you say is of the Manufacture of <hi>Barbary:</hi> And this the holy <hi>Ferdinand</hi> did so a little after that he had receivd the Title of <hi>Catholic King</hi> from the Apostolicall See; nor do I think King <hi>Almansor</hi> that you ever heard or read of an Act of more infidelity and ingratitude, by <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen, Infidel,</hi> or <hi>Pagan.</hi>

               <p>This Treaty with <hi>England</hi> was above ten yeers in agitation, it was a Web that lay long upon the Loom of Policy, and afterwards was torn off being just wrought to the point of perfection: By the endeavours of <hi>Count Gondomar</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Bristol</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> matters were brought to such a hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full pass, that it inducd the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> to undertake that hazardous youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full journey to <hi>Spain,</hi> traversing the whole Diameter of <hi>France</hi> under a disguise, being accompanied with the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> who was not only his <hi>Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> but had bin his chiefest <hi>Counsellor</hi> herein; they came both in an advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous time to <hi>Paris,</hi> for they were admitted to see a Mask, being <hi>Carnival</hi> time, wher the Prince had a full view of the Lady <hi>Henri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Being arrivd at the Earl of <hi>Bristols</hi> House in the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> at the close of the day, in the evening he was struck with amazement to see such objects there, having no fore-knowledg at all of the Plot, saying, <hi>I am afraid we are all undone;</hi> The next day there was a buz abroad that som great man was com from <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but none imagind he could be the Prince: In the evening of the next day, the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> went in a close Coach to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> where he had privat audience, and he was returnd no sooner but <hi>Olivares</hi> was sent to visit the Prince, which was done with extraordinary expressions of joy and comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Oliuares</hi> saying, that <hi>Spain and England wold divide the World betwixt

               <p>So much for matter of <hi>Ceremony</hi>; now touching the <hi>substance</hi> of the business it self, when the Prince came thither, matters had bin brought to that perfection by the activity of Ambassadors, that there wanted nothing for the consummating of all things but the Popes dispensation, which upon news that the Prince was com to <hi>Spain,</hi> was retarded, and som advantages taken to clog it with fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther clauses; The Pope demanded caution for performance of such Articles that were granted, in favor of the Roman Catholicks in <hi>England</hi> upon this match; hereupon Sir <hi>Francis Cotington</hi> rid Post about it from <hi>Madrid,</hi> Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that point King <hi>Iames</hi> answerd, that he wold take his oath upon the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists to accomplish the said Articles, and his Son the Prince shold do the like; His privy Counsellors also shold firm and subscribe the sayed Articles, and this was all the security King <hi>Iames</hi> cold give: Now wheras the Pope demanded that som Roman Catholic Prince should undertake for him and his Son in point of performance of Articles, he answerd, that he had not such an interest in any such Prince, so matters began to gather ill blood, and were allmost quite off the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, insomuch that there was a dark rumour abroad, how the Prince had a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign to get away privatly, and in a disguise as he came; The English-men that were then attending the Prince, wherof there were a good number that were dyeted at the Kings house, and waited upon by Spaniards, wold often times break out into bold speeches, by disdaining the Dyet and barrenness of <hi>Spain,</hi> and jeering their processions, wherat there were exceptions taken, and the main business receivd som prejudice by their indiscretions: <hi>Archey</hi> the Fool, being then in <hi>Madrid,</hi> was admi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>As matters were thus at a doubtfull stand, because of the Popes demand in point of caution for the performance of those Capitulations which were stipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated in favour of the English Catholicks, by vertu of this match, The King of <hi>Spain</hi> gave the Prince a visit, and told him, that rather then a Treaty of so many yeers agitation shold fall to the ground, and that those noble affections which he had shewd his Sister (for whom he had put hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>A little after the King and the Prince had a solemn enterview in the privat Gallery, for signing, sealing, and swearing unto the Articles. The King had the Patriarch of the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Infantado, Oliuares,</hi> and <hi>Gondamar</hi> with him; The Prince had the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Bristol,</hi> and the Lord <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But as Heaven would have it, Som few daies before the betrothing day was com, it chancd that Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the 15th. dyed, and <hi>Vrban</hi> the 8. who succeeded him fell suddenly sick; hereupon the King of <hi>Spain</hi> gave the Prince another visit, telling him that he had received ill news from <hi>Rome,</hi> for his holy Father the Pope was dead, who was so good a friend to this Match, &amp; now he cold proceed no further for the complea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the work without a <hi>Ratification</hi> of the former dispensation by the present Pope, whom he was to obey as his Spirituall Father, which task he wold under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to do by his own Ministers without puting his Highness to any trouble, and the busines was of that consequence that he feard it wold require som time, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the indisposition of the new Pope, therfore he desired his Highnes pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the interim, and now that he had stayed so many yeers for a wife, he shold not think it much to stay a few months longer; the Prince answerd, That he was sorry for the news from <hi>Rome,</hi> and wheras his Majesty had a <hi>Spirituall</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he himself had a <hi>Naturall</hi> Father to obey, who was now becom crazy and indisposd in his health, which encreasd by his so long inexpected absence from him being his only Son, therfore he had sent him a peremptory command to be in <hi>England</hi> in such a month because Winter came on a pace, to which purpose he had sent a royall Fleet for him under the command of the Earl of <hi>Rutland</hi>; besides, he had intelligence that there were some murmurings in <hi>England</hi> for his so long abode in <hi>Spain,</hi> which might break out into dangerous consequences, and hazard the rupture of the Match which had there so many Enemies among the <hi>Puritans</hi>: Moreover he sayed, that when he came to <hi>Spain</hi> he thought he came not to <hi>treat</hi> of a <hi>Marriage,</hi> but to fetch <hi>home a wife</hi> whom he was loth to trust with any but himself; the King replyed, then your Highnes may please to leave

a Proxy behind you to do the work, and I shall take it for an honor if you make me your Deputy to perform the Rites of the Espousals, which upon the faith of a Catholic King shall be performd the same week, after that the Ratification shall com from <hi>Rome,</hi> to which purpose he wold engage his Contratation house in <hi>Sevill,</hi> if need requird. The Prince shewd himself to be mightily taken with this proposall, so he left two Proxies behind in the Earl of <hi>Bristols</hi> hands, one for the King and another for <hi>Don Carlos</hi> his brother, to be his Substitutes the wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding day; so the Prince put himself in an Equipage for his return to <hi>England,</hi> and the King with his two brothers and Grandees accompanied him beyond the <hi>Escuriall</hi> on his way, and wold have done it to the Sea-side, had not the Queen bin then big with Child: At their parting King and Prince often embracd one another, but <hi>Oliuares</hi> and <hi>Buckingham</hi> did not part so kindly, for the Duke told him that he was infinitely beholden to their Majesties of <hi>Spain</hi> for many royall Favors, as also to the Lady <hi>Infanta,</hi> and that he wold live and dy there Servant, and continu to do his best Offices for continuance of peace twixt tht two Crowns, but for your self <hi>Count Oliuares</hi> he sayed, I must tell you plainly you have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obligd me so far, that I cannot make further profession of friendship unto you without flattery; <hi>Oliuares</hi> turnd about and made this short answer, <hi>aceto lo die<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sto,</hi> I accept of what you say, and touching the first part of your Speech, if you perform what you promise you will do well, and I must tell you that your own safety depends upon it, but for any particular correspondence of friendship twixt you and me, it matters not much, and so I bid you farewell.</p>

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:96399:123"/>
as the busines was upon its last period there come four Posts from <hi>England</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the space of 24 hours with a new Commission from King <hi>Iames</hi> to the Earl of <hi>Bristol,</hi> intimating that wheras he treated before singly of a match, he shold now joyn the Palatinat with it, and have a categoricall conclusive answer from the King of <hi>Spain</hi> for the restitution of it; for he wold <hi>not marry his son with joy, and leave his daughter in tears</hi>; This struck a strange kind of consternation in the hearts of all men at <hi>Madrid,</hi> who wishd that the Postillions which brought the new Commission to <hi>Bristoll</hi> had all broke their necks on the way: the <hi>Infanta</hi> retird her self, and wore a kind of mourning for som daies, and an universall sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness appeard in all faces.</p>
               <p>Hereupon the Earl of <hi>Bristol</hi> going to the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to demand a surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Palatinat, He answer'd that it was not in his power to do it, for hee could not command an Emperour in whose hands it was, with whom if <hi>England</hi> would entertain a Treaty, if the Emperour and the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> wold not com to terms of reason, the same arm which got the sayd Palatinat for his Oncle (the Emperour) shold joyn with the King of <hi>England</hi> to reconquer it for his son in law; But this not satisfying, <hi>Bristol</hi> receiv'd Letters of Revocation, and so going to take his leave of the King, he pulld off a ring of 1500 <hi>l.</hi> price off his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and gave it him, sending him afterwards a Cup-board or old Plate valued at 20000. duckets.</p>
               <p>The Prince at his departure left a great rope of Pearl and many boxes of Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els more for the Infanta, valued at 400000. crowns; but she would not receive any till the Nuptiall day, so they were kept in the custody of one of the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries of State: But notwithstanding that intelligence was sent how the two Treaties of <hi>Match</hi> and <hi>Palatinat</hi> were dissolv'd by act of Parlement in <hi>England,</hi> and that they were preparing for a War, yet the <hi>Spaniard</hi> comanded the sayd Jewels to be deliverd up to the <hi>English</hi> Ambassador, which after were sent safely to <hi>England:</hi> Out of the premisses it may be inferrd that the <hi>Spanyard</hi> did really intend a match with <hi>England,</hi> which he saith he hath not broken to this day: In <hi>Spain</hi> the King was young and his Favorit old, it was clean contrary in <hi>England</hi> which made the world abroad to wonder that King <hi>Iames</hi> shold be transported by the Councell of a young Favorit, as to suffer him to strain the conscience of his son so far as to break the Match; now, most remarkable it is, that as the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement serv'd him for an Instrument to do it, so the Parlement was the chief in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument afterwards of his ruin.</p>
               <p>Thus the Spanish Match which amus'd the world so long, and assorded such matter of discours was suddenly dashd, that Fabrique which was a rearing so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeers, and brought to such a point of perfection that it only wanted a cover, fell down in a moment.</p>
               <p>A little before these times the Duke of <hi>Ossuna</hi> a little man, but of a mighty spirit, was Vice-roy of <hi>Naples,</hi> where he had comitted more extravagances then any Vice-roy ever did; He raisd a War against the <hi>Venetian</hi> for a property of Dominion in som part of the Adriatic gulph, wherin he causd the Signory to spend much treasure, but afterwards it was found that this War was grounded rather upon the Capricio of his brain, then any just reason: Therupon the King of <hi>Spain</hi> sent the Cardinall <hi>Borja</hi> to seize upon the government of <hi>Naples,</hi> and send home the Duke prisoner if he found cause; The Cardinall carried the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes very privatly, and being com to a little Iland neer <hi>Naples,</hi> the sagacious Duke smelling somthing, sent a Bishop to entertain and wait upon him, but it was indeed to serve as a Spy to observe his motions.

The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation was of that quality, that it was sufficient to put impression in him of an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting jealousie, in regard that through the sides of <hi>Buckingham</hi> they wounded the Prince his Son, together with the Nobility, for it is not probable that they could bring to effect such a design without departing totally from the Obligation of that faith and loyalty, which they owd to his person and Crown, because the Lords made themselves culpable as Concealors, Nor is it likely that the Duke wold put himself upon such an enterprize, without communicating it first to the Prince, and knowing of his pleasure.</p>
                     <p>But because this information might be made more cleer, his Majesty did make ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny instances unto the sayed Ambassadors that they wold give him the Authors of the sayed conjuration, this being the sole means wherby their own honor might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servd, and whereby the great zeal and care they pretended to have of his person might appear: But the sayed Ambassadors in stead of confirming the great zeal they made profession to bear him, all the answer they made him consisted of arguments against the discovery of the Conspirators, so that for confirmation of the sayed report, there r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Duke after a long pauze, thankd him and the Nobility for their good af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections towards him, but this was a business of that hazard and consequence that it requird som deliberation; that he knew well there was no Medium be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a Throne and a Scaffold, and so shewd himselfe irresolute for the present.

               <p>Hereupon the cry went all over <hi>Lisbon, Viva El Roy Don Iuan el quarto,</hi> God save King <hi>Iohn</hi> the fourth; yet in all this hurly-burly the Vice-queen was dealt civilly withall; and when som of the Nobility came to her, she made this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet Speech unto them, being nothing at all daunted, <hi>That if this Insurrection had no other aime but to revenge themselves of Secretary</hi> Vasconcellos, <hi>the busines was done, therfore she assurd them upon returning to their obedience to gain them a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall pardon from the King her Lord and Nephew</hi>: But they answerd her in short, Madam, We have now no other King but King <hi>Iohn,</hi> wherof we com to give you notice, so they removd the Vice-queen from the Royall Palace to another house, leaving a band of Soldiers for her security.</p>
               <p>The Arch-bishop of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> who was the chiefest stikler in this desperat busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, to cover this Insurrection with some signal act of devotion, came forth in a solemn procession, carrying in his hand the chiefest relique of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> which is

               <p>The carriage and courage of the Vice Queen the Dutchesse of <hi>Savoy</hi> was very commendable in these confusions, for wheras the new King sent her a comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ascertain her of such civilities that were sutable to a Princesse of her Rank, provided she wold forbear all discourse and practises wherby to infuse any opinion prejudiciall to the now establishd Government, yet she notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing with much stoutnes (but with expressions of thankfulnes to the Duke, for she wold not stile him King) fell into a large and grave exhortation to those Nobles <hi>that were sent to her to lay aside all vain hopes, and not to cozen themselves, but to return to their old alleagance according as they were obligd by oath, not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but they should all find pardon.</hi>

               <p>The Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> which is also <hi>Sicily</hi> (beyond the <hi>Phare</hi> a little arm of the Sea, and thought at the Creation to be one entire continent) having intelligence how well their Neighbours and Fellow-subjects had sped, the tother side by that popular Insurrection, thought that they were as free born people as the <hi>Sicilian,</hi> and did contribute more to the Spanish greatnes, their Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, therfore they might very well deserve and expect as good usage as they: There had bin not long before a new Tax layd upon all Fruits green &amp; dry, which amounted to about eighty thousand Duckets yeerly. The Duke of <hi>Arcos</hi> then Vice-roy was often told that there was an universall muttering at this Tax, which might beget dangerous consequences: Hereupon som Commissioners were appointed to consult how som other way might be taken to raise monies for the King, as also to repay those sums that had bin imprested, and already lent upon the credit of the sayed Fruit Tax.</p>
               <p>At that time there was in <hi>Naples</hi> a young fellow about four and twenty yeers old, who got his living by retayling of Fish up and down, he was of a stirring and spritfull humor, of a confident speech and utterance: This poor Retayler of Fish calld <hi>Thomas Anello</hi> and by contraction <hi>Masanello,</hi> observing what dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents and mutterings raignd in every corner about this Tax upon fruit, with divers others; and the next day meeting with a great company of boyes in the Market-place, he made them follow him up and down the streets, with sticks and

Canes in their hands, making them cry out, <hi>Let the Pope live, let the King of</hi> Spain <hi>live, but let the ill Government perish.</hi> This and such like Doctrine being infusd by <hi>Masanello</hi> into his young Schollers, the Shop-keepers laught at him as he went, asking him whether he were not frantic or foolish, but he told them, <hi>yee laugh at me now, but you shall see shortly what Masanello can do, let me alone, if I do not free you from the Slavery of so many Taxes let me be held infamous for ever.</hi> At which Speech the laughter encreasd, but <hi>Masanello</hi> grew more and more inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious about the work, so that he enrol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

From henceforth yee shall shake off your necks the intolerable yoke of so many grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which have depressd your spirits hitherto; To effect which I do not care a rush to be torn in peeces, and dragd up and down the gutters of</hi> Naples: <hi>Let all the blood of my body spin out of my veins, let this head skip off my sholders by a fatal steel, &amp; be pearchd up in this Market-place upon a Pole, yet I shall dy contented and glorious, it will be an honor and a triumph unto me that my life and blood perishd in so glorious a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Speech did wonderfully work upon the people, whose hearts were ready to cooperat with him, so for a handsom beginning the Toll-house for Fruit with all the books of accounts were burnt to the ground, with much of the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomers goods which were shewd there: Hereupon the Shops were shut up and down almost through all the City, and the Keepers of them went to other quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the City where the Toll-houses for Corn, Flesh, Fish, Salt, Wine, Oyle, Cheese, and Silk, stood, all which they burnt to the very earth, withall the writing and Custom house books, as also all the Hangings and Houshold-stuff were hurld into a great Straw-fire, together with som Chests of moneys and Plate, and all burnt: And in this confusion there was this strickt point of Government al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, <hi>that it was de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

went about, and coming to Saint <hi>Iames</hi> Prison they freed there all the Prisoners and admitted them to their Society: At last they came under the Vice-roys window and made a hideous cry, that they wold be freed not only of the Fruit <hi>Gabell,</hi> but of all other, specially that of Corn; The Vice-roy out of his Balcone promisd them very fair to take off quite the Fruit Tax, &amp; half of that of Corn, but this not suffizing they rusht into the Vice-roys Palace, notwithstanding the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and Spanish Guards which were there, and breaking through all the Rooms they came at last to that Room where the Vice-roy was shut up under lock, which they broke open, but the Vice-king was fled, and thinking to go to the Castle where his Lady was retired, he found the Draw-bridg up, and so came back and fled to a <hi>Franciscan</hi> Monastery; while the Rabble was in his Palace they did much mischief, and pursuing him still, and understanding that he was retired to the Monastery, he was forcd to com out and to shew himself. The people then though in the height of fury grew somwhat more temperat, saying, <hi>Most excellent Sir, for the passion of God disburden us of these Gabells who suck our blood, let us but breath and have no more slavery.</hi> The Vice-roy giving them the charmingst language he could, causd little Cedules signed by himself and seald with the Kings Seal affixed, to be dispersd amongst them, wherin the sayd Tolls were taken off; afterwards he threw som peeces of gold and Rials of eight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, so by that costly cunning be got away from among the Rabble for that time, to a Church hard by where they still pursued him, and wold not be satisfied till they had a perfect Instrument for the taking off the Tax upon Fruit and bread, the confusion grew higher and higher till the Arch-bishop <hi>Filomarmi</hi> came, to whom they shewd som reverence being their Metropolitan and common Father, and he at last brought them an Instrument signd by the Vice-roy for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolishing the foresayd Tolls; so that gave som contentment for the present, but the Torrent encreasd presently with greater floods of water, for that Instrument of the Vice-kings being read in the Market-place, the cry was that it was imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, for they wold be free from all kinds of Tolls since the time of <hi>Charles</hi> the Emperor, Hereupon they went to the Prince of <hi>Bisignano</hi> the chief of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raffas desiring him to be their Leader and Advocat to the Vice-roy; he went with them and being com to the great Church <hi>de Carmine,</hi> he stood up in a high place with a Crucifix in his hands, and conjurd the people for the love of God and the most blessed Virgin, to be pacified a while, and he promisd them by oath, to procure for them from the Vice-roy whatsoever they desird: But this wold not quiet them, but they rushd into the Prisons and set loose the Prisoners; They went to the <hi>Dogana</hi> or <hi>Toll-house</hi> for Corn, with Faggots on their backs, and pitch and fire in their hands in a great fury: Prince <hi>Bisignano</hi> not being able to take them off though he labourd earnestly, they put fire on all sides, and besides the houses, they turnd rich Houshold stuff, Sedias, and ready money all to ashes. The Prince being but crazy in point of health, grew weary of heeding such an unruly Rabble, therfore he rid himself of them at last by a Stratagem; The people hearing that <hi>Bisignano</hi> was gon, &amp; wanting a Head they cryed out for <hi>Masanello,</hi> who having accepted of it, he began more eagerly then ever to invite the people, insomuch that he in lieu of water to quench this fire threw Oyle upont to make it burn more furious. The next day <hi>Másanello</hi> Captain-like divided the people into Companies and Regiments, nothing but clashing of Armes within the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, whether the Country Swains came with Pikeaxes Shovels and Spades; Nay, the women appeard armd with Shovels, Spits, and Broaches, and the common cry went <hi>Let the King live and the Toll perish, our Gabels our Tolls, let them go to the Devill to maintain his Kingdom of darknes; let the Raisers of them those Dogs dy, who being transformd to Wolfs have devoured the flesh of innocent Lambs, let them vomit the blood they have suckd into the Cinders of their burnt Wealth, those domestic and insatiable Leeches of</hi> Naples, <hi>let these Drones and Wasps be driven away who have suckd the sweet Hony of the Bees.</hi> With such cries and screekings they stounded the very air in such pitteous accents, which were enough to soften the hardest Marble, and draw tears from the Pumice stone. Thus horror, blood and amazements raignd in every corner; so order was sent by <hi>Masanello</hi> to all

               <p>The next morning <hi>Masanello</hi> put off his Cloth of silver-sute, and took again the Habit of a Marriner, yet was he obeyd and feard as much as formerly: He wold rise betimes and give audience in the Market-place out of a window which was in his house, whither they wold reach him Petitions on the tops of Pikes, he had alwaies an Archibuz ready cockd hard by him, which was of som terror to those who came to petition or sollicit about any business.</p>
               <p>By these furious Traverses and popular confusions matters at last came to that point of perfection that the Originall Charter of <hi>Charles</hi> the Emperor having bin publickly producd, revivd, and ratified, the Vice-roy issued forth this generall Indulgence in the Kings name and his own.</p>

                  </gap>s gave a shrewd shock to the Spanish Monarchy; It shook also <hi>Oliva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res</hi> the great Favorit of the Catholic King, and that so ill favourdly, that his utter downfall followd: Now in regard that this Favorit slept in the Kings bosom, and swayd the Monachy of <hi>Spain</hi> so long, it will not be improper to insert here a short Legend of his life. He was born in <hi>Rome</hi> during his Fathers Embassy there in the (unlucky) Palace of <hi>Nero,</hi> and being a younger Brother, at his coming to <hi>Spain,</hi> he became a Student in the Law in <hi>Salamanca,</hi> and then got a Lay Prebendary in <hi>Sevill</hi> which was his first preferment; Having got som subsistence and knowledge, he came to Court, and insinuated into the favor of this King then Prince so dextrously that he came afterwards to have an absolute power over his inclinations, after the fall of the Duke of <hi>Lerma</hi> and <hi>Don Balthasar de Zuniga,</hi> upon whose ruines he built his fortunes: In a short time after the death of <hi>Philip</hi> the third, he was made Master of the Kings War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drobe, Master of the Horse, great Chancellor of the Indies, which Offices with som Comanderies he got of the three Equestrall Orders of Saint <hi>Iago, Alcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tara,</hi> and <hi>Calatrava</hi> were worth him <hi>communibus annis</hi> 240000. Crowns But he had other reaches to grow rich, for when the Galeons set forth from <hi>Sevill,</hi> and the <hi>Caracks</hi> from <hi>Lisbon</hi> every yeer for the Indies, he usd to embark in them great Cargazons of Corn, Wine, and Oyle, Custom free, all which grew in his County of <hi>Olivares,</hi> and with the proceed of those Commodeties there were Jewels, Silks, and Spices, bought and sold afterward for his account, wherby he could not choose but gain many millions; For engrossing the Kings Favor more entirely, he had a way to restrain the Grandees, but whom he pleasd, from being about the Kings person, and for the Queen she was only Co-partner of the Kings Bed, but he kept her from having any power at all in other things; He found divers inventions for inhancing the Royall Revenew, as that all Offices and Benefices which were bestowd, shold pay half a yeers in-com to the King,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:96399:137"/>
which was calld <hi>Mediannates:</hi> There were waies also found out to decry and raise the value of Coin, and not long before his fall there was a project calld <hi>Papell Sellado,</hi> which was that no legall Instrument, not so much as a Bill Obligatory shold be of force, unless it were written in the Kings Paper with a particular Seal to it, and all public Notaries with others were to buy these seald Papers at the rate the King imposd upon them, by these means there was a Computation made that above two hundred millions of gold came extraordinary to the Kings Coffers in his time: Now these new things being imposd upon <hi>Catalonia</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> which claim more priviledges of enfranchisements then <hi>Castillia,</hi> it was among other the ground of their Revolt.</p>
               <p>Now there were many things conspird to demolish this Grand <hi>Minion</hi> of the Catholic Kings.</p>
               <p>First, A series or crowd of ill successes which tumbled one upon the neck of another, both in the Indies as the loosing of <hi>Ormus</hi> and <hi>Goa,</hi> as also in <hi>Europe,</hi> and in <hi>Spain</hi> her self by the revolt of <hi>Catalonia</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> in <hi>Flanders</hi> by the loosing of many Towns which <hi>Francis</hi> the first had payd for his ransom. Nor was there any signall Exploit worth the speaking atchievd all his time, but that of <hi>Spinolas</hi> when he took the Palatinat,</p>
               <p>Secondly, The disaffection of the Queen whom he may be sayd to have kept to her Needle and Distaff all the while, who one day broke out into such a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion against him having done her som ill office a little before, that meeting him in a Lobby she took off one of her Chapines and banging him ill favourdly about the Pate, sayed, <hi>That she wold have him know that she was Daughter to</hi> Henry <hi>the Great, as well as wife to the King of</hi> Spain: But this breach was made up present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by the patience and humble protestations of the Conde, never to offend her for the future. Awhile after the Kings affairs necessitating him to go in person to <hi>Catalonia,</hi> he left the Queen Governesse of <hi>Madrid,</hi> during which time she wonderfully gaind upon the affections of the people, by allaying the austere humor of the Spaniard with the affability of the French: At the Kings return she took heart then to speak of his affairs of state, of the interest of his Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, of the revolt of Kingdome, ruine of Armies, and how all things went from bad to worse, and were like to continue so, if they whom his Majesty intrusted most with the management of his affairs did not look better to things: This discourse sunk somwhat deep into the Kings brest, which made his thoughts to reflect upon <hi>Olivares</hi> his chief Minister; and now the Ice being broken the next night after <hi>Donna Anna de Guevara</hi> the Kings Nurse, took heart of grace to speak also to the King, having put her self in a convenient place where the King was to pass, where falling on her knees she told him, <hi>That she was not there to beg any grace at his Majesties hands, but to render the Crown of</hi> Spain <hi>the greatest Service it cold receive, therfore her Motherly affections enforcd her to discover to his Majesty what perhaps others durst not adventure to do for humane respects; So she presented unto him the generall affliction of his people, the sad condition of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the many unfortunat successes which happend by Sea and Land, shewing him that these evills were the judgments of Heaven, for suffering the Government of his Kingdoms which God Almighty had appointed only for himself, to continue in the hands of another; she sayd that it was high time for his Majesty to be now out of his Nonage, and that he should not incense the indignation of Heaven, by suffring his poor Subjects to be longer abusd, at least that he wold have compassion on the Prince his Son who ran a hazard to be simple King of</hi> Castile <hi>or less, so she concluded that if she had offended his Majesty she was ready to receive what punishment he pleasd, being well contented having given her milk for the good of his Majesty, to sacrifice also her blood if need requird.</hi> The King hearkned unto her all the while with much attention, and answerd tis all truth that you have sayd: Add hereunto that there was another thing happend that provd fatall to the Duke, which was that the <hi>Infanta Margarita</hi> of <hi>Savoy</hi> who had bin Governess of <hi>Portugal,</hi> having bin restraind som yeers from coming to the Court by the practises of <hi>Olivares,</hi> at last venturd to com thither, and by the Queens favour she was admitted to
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:96399:137"/>
speak with the King, where with stout and pressing reasons she made it appear that the loss of his Kingdom of <hi>Portugal</hi> was to be imputed principally to the carelesness of the <hi>Conde,</hi> for she had often written to him in what a hazardous discontented state that Country was, but to her Avisos and Letters she receivd from him odd uncivill messages, telling her that she was fitter to govern a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily then a Kingdom, and bidding her that if she comprehended the mysteries of State, at least she shold not discover them; This Speech made deeper impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions on the Kings heart then any of the rest, for it was most home and plain, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch that this was the mortall wound which was given <hi>Olivares.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, The designs he had to aggrandize his base Son who had gone many yeers by the name of <hi>Iulian Valeasar,</hi> and had married a common Strumpet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a dissolute one himself, and under that name of <hi>Valeasar</hi> he had born Arms in <hi>Flanders, Italy,</hi> and the <hi>Indies,</hi> where he was like to be hangd; Yet <hi>Oliva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res</hi> having no Children of his own nor like to have any, sent for him, for <hi>Donna Margarita Spinola</hi> a Merchants Daughter, (and somtimes a Concubine of <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vares</hi>) took it upon her death that <hi>Olivares</hi> had got him by Her; So being com to Court <hi>Olivares</hi> had his name changd to <hi>Don Henry Pbilip de Gusman,</hi> he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curd him also to be divorcd from his first wife, and proposd a marriage for him with the high Constable of <hi>Castiles</hi> Daughter, <hi>Donna Iuana de Velasso</hi> prime La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Court, which took effect; so having provided a great Palace for him, the Grandees and Ambassadors came to give <hi>Don Henry</hi> the conjugall joy, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting by the Title of Excellency, and sending him Presents, he was declard Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of the Kings Bed-chamber, and to be president of the Indies: But <hi>Don Henries</hi> carriage was so ridiculous and so unsutable to a Noble-man that there were Libells made of him up and down; This strange design of <hi>Olivares</hi> got him much hatred, specially from the Marquess of <hi>Carpio,</hi> who had married his sole Sister, by whom he had <hi>Don Luis de Haro</hi> the Present, who was common Heir in Law to <hi>Olivares,</hi> and was like to be deprivd of it by the foresayd Bastard; But upon the fall of the <hi>Conde</hi> down fell also his Bastard, and the Constable of <hi>Castile</hi> sent home for his Daughter, saying, that he had rather have his Daughter to be reputed a Whore, then to continue Wife to such a Rascall.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The just hatred which the Grandees and Noble-men conceivd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him did accelerat his ruin, specially the Marquess of <hi>Carpio</hi> his Brother-in-law, whose Son though a very hopefull Gentleman he could not abide, though his Nephew by his only Sister.</p>
               <p>Lastly, the little Prince <hi>Don Balthasar</hi> helpd to push him down, who though he was fourteen yeers of age yet by the practises of the Duke he had no Court, or Servants settled for him, but was still left under the Government of women; Now it was about the Prince that the King first discoverd his displeasure to <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vares,</hi> for asking him what Lodgings in the Palace were fittest for him, and he answering those of the <hi>Infante Cardinal,</hi> the King replyed, and why not yours? for they were my Fathers, and mine also while I was Prince: This struck an Earth-quake in the Dukes brest, so that evening the King writ a Note to him with his own hand that he shold intermeddle no more with his affairs, but retire to <hi>Loches</hi> a place hard by <hi>Madrid</hi> untill further order; The next day his wife came weeping to the Queen to intercede for her husband, but the Queen answerd her very calmly <hi>Lo que hecho Dios, lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> vassallos, y lot malos sucessos no lo puede deshazer el Roy ni yo,</hi> Neither the King nor I can undo that which God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, the Subjects, and ill Successes have done. So a few daies after <hi>Olivares</hi> went to <hi>Loches</hi> in a close privat Coach at the back-gate of the Court, for fear of the fury of the people, and he was seated between two Jesuits as if he had bin going to execution, which was a true morall one; but som two yeers after <hi>Death</hi> the common Executioner of all Man-kind took him away.</p>
               <p>The next day the King calld a Councell of State where he made a Speech un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, that he had deprivd the <hi>Conde</hi> Duke of <hi>Olivares</hi> of his Service not for any Crime that he had committed, but to give satisfaction to his Subjects, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his desire was that the memory of the <hi>Conde</hi> Duke might be kept in esteem among all men for the good Services which he had so faithfully rendred to the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:96399:138"/>
Crown so many yeers, protesting for the future not to give the Title of <hi>Privado,</hi> or <hi>Favorit</hi> to any Minister whatsoever, being resolvd that all weighty matters shold pass through his own hands.</p>
               <p>This was the sad Catastrophe of <hi>Olivares</hi> his Greatnes, a man nothing of so candid and debonnair dispositions as his Predecessor, witnes his disaffection to his neerest Kindred, as also to the Duke of <hi>Lerma,</hi> against whom he discoverd much malevolence to his death; Among others, one passage was, that when the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> was to pass by <hi>Valladolid</hi> where <hi>Lerma</hi> livd, he had a speciall Mandat sent him to absent himself in the interim from the Town till the Prince was gone; this went to the heart of the old Duke, who sayd therupon, that <hi>Olivares</hi> had done him from time to time many ill offices, but this carried more malice then any of the rest, which he much resented in regard he had so earnest a desire to see the Prince and to speak with him, he having bin the first who put the Treaty of alliance on foot, therfore it was suspected that he wold have discoverd somthing unto him prejudiciall to <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to give <hi>Don Gaspar de Olivares</hi> his due, he had solid and sufficient parts for a great Minister of state, his passions were very high for the greatning of his Master, to the transactions of whose affairs he indefatigably addicted himself; He was a professd Enemy to all Presents, he never usd to give audience to Ladies, or any women, but wold receive their busines by Letters. Lastly, the greatest fault which I find he could be guilty of was, that he was not so <hi>succesfull</hi> as he was <hi>sedulous.</hi> Thus fell that huge Swayer of the Spanish Monarchy above thirty yeers, and it seems with the Kings favor, his spirits quickly fayld him; for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving from <hi>Loches</hi> to <hi>Toro,</hi> he there met with his last about sixteen months af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. His body being opend there was found in his Skull above two pounds of Brains, and at the day of his buriall, there was a huge Tempest fell with extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary fulgurations and cracks of Thunder, as we read, that when <hi>Katherin de Medici</hi> was buried in <hi>France,</hi> there fell such a hidious storm that fifty Sayl of Merchant-men were cast away upon the Coasts of <hi>Britany:</hi> The sorest E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy <hi>Olivares</hi> had was the Queen, which made him say that <hi>Muger hizo echar el primer hombre fuera de'l</hi> parayso; <hi>y muger hizo echar a mi fuera del</hi> palacio, A Woman was the cause that the first man was thrust out of <hi>Paradice,</hi> and a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was the cause that I also was thrust out of the Kings <hi>Palace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Conde <hi>de Castrillo</hi> brother to the Marquess of <hi>Carpio,</hi> who was brother-in-law to <hi>Olivares,</hi> was one of the chiefest Engins which helpd to pull down this great Tree, being a sober and wise well weighd man: He is now Vice-roy of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> having succeeded the little Conde <hi>d Ognate</hi> who had done such signall su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pererogatory Services in suppressing those horrid tumults in <hi>Naples</hi> where the power of <hi>Spain</hi> was upon point of sinking; and his wisdom was no less discernd in settling peace, and stopping the wide breaches wherwith that Kingdom had bin so miserably rent, as also in finding out and punishing the chiefest Incendia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, wherof there were divers who felt the sharp Sword of <hi>Nemesis</hi>; And last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for devising waies to raise sums countervaylable to those Gabels and Taxes, which the King was enforcd to abolish by the fury of the people.</p>
               <p>And now will I take leave of the <hi>gentle Parthenope,</hi> that <hi>three Castled</hi> and high crested Citty, but a few words further of her Pedigree before we part; she was built presently after the Wars of <hi>Troy</hi> by a young Grecian Lady calld <hi>Parthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nope,</hi> whose statue is to be seen there: She was Daughter of <hi>Eumelus</hi> Son to <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metus</hi> King of <hi>Thessaly,</hi> after her Fathers death she consulted with the Oracle at <hi>Delphos</hi> what her Fortunes shold be, the Oracle told her that she was designd for another Country, to be the Foundress of a noble Citty which shold be famous all the Earth over, therfore she embarkd her self with divers more, and sayling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the <hi>Tyrrhen</hi> Sea, she landed at last in the next Promontory to <hi>Naples,</hi> whence as the Legend tells a white Dove conducted her to that palce, where <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> now stands, where she began to build and trace a Citty, which she calld by her own name <hi>Parthenope,</hi> or the <hi>Virgin Citty,</hi> which appellation continued till <hi>Octavianus</hi> the Emperor who first calld her <hi>Neapolis,</hi> or the City of <hi>Navigation,</hi> she being in rising postures like an Amphitheater on the Sea-side, and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:96399:138"/>
comodious for trafic, she abounds with Silks, Oyles, Flowers, Fruits, and a most generous Race of Horses, as any place upon the earthly Globe: As her Horses are generous, so they are observd to be more docile, and neer to ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall Creatures then any where else, for which this instance shall be producd; Cardinall <hi>Bentivoglio</hi> sent <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth of <hi>France</hi> a choice Napolitan Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser with his Keeper; when the Horse was brought before the King, he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded one of his Riders to mount him, who neither with Switch or Spur wold scarce stir or shew any feats of activity, the King herupon and the Beholders began to disparage the Horse, taking him for som dull Jade, hereupon the King desird an Italian Rider to mount him, the Horse when he saw his own Rider rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to back him, fell a trembling all over, but the Rider being got up he began to prance and flounce so nimbly as if he wold have flown into the Air, to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement of all the Spectators, so King <hi>Henry</hi> with the Present beggd the Rider of the Cardinall, whom he entertaind all his life-time.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Napolitan</hi> being born in a luxurious Country is observd to be the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Embracer of pleasure, the greatest Courtier of Ladies, and the most indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of himself of any other Nation, insomuch that no command of the King can make a <hi>Napolitan</hi> Gentleman to go upon any Service for three months in Sommer till the heats are over: They are full of Noble Friendship one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and somtime they make their <hi>love</hi> to men controul their <hi>lust</hi> to women; As there was a notable example these late yeers in the person of the young Marquess <hi>Oliverio,</hi> who being desperatly in love with the Countess of <hi>Castleno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vo,</hi> layd siege to her a good while, and the Count going to a Country-house of his, and taking his Countess and Family with him, the Marquess being more and more enflamd, goes to the Country hard by one day a Hawking and let flies his Hawk into the Count of <hi>Castlenovos</hi> Gardens, where it chancd he and his Countes were walking, the Marquess made bold to retreeve his Hawk, the Count with very high Civilities did welcom him, and causd a Banquet to be presently provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, where he and his Lady entertaind him; being gone the Count began to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the Marquess, telling his wife that he was one of the hopefullst young No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men, and the fullest of parts of any in the whole Kingdom; These praises made such impressions in the Countess that a little after he gaind her, so the time and place of pleasure being appointed, he was let in a privat way to her Chamber, where she being a bed as he was undressing himself to go to her, she told him that he was beholden to the Count her Husband for this Favor, for she never heard him speak so much in commendation of any; Is it so, sayd the Marquess? then I shold be the arrantst Villan in the world to abuse so noble a Friend, so he put on his Dubblet agen, and departed (but with much civillity) in the very height and heat of lust, though he had so commodious conjuncture of time as his heart could desire.</p>
               <p>But as the Napolitan have a high noble method of Friendship amongst them, so are they as revengfull as any other Italian: Among a world of examples that could be producd, let this suffice; In the ancient Citty of <hi>Nocera</hi> there were three young Noble-men calld <hi>Conrado, Cesare,</hi> and <hi>Alexandro,</hi> the eldest was Prince of the place (before <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifts time.) There was and is still in <hi>Nocera</hi> a strong Castle where the Prince <hi>Conrado</hi> had a Garrison wherof he made a Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of his Captain, and Keeper of the Castle, the Prince most of his time kept in his Country-house and his Brothers also, but somtimes he wold com and ly som dayes in his Castle; It fortund that his Captain having a comly woman to his wife the Prince fell in love with, and never left till he enjoyd her, which he had done often to the knowledg of her husband, so beating his brains how to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengd he fell upon this way; The Prince being at his Country-house<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain sent him word that there were two wild Boares discoverd in the Forrest hard by, therfore if he and his two Brothers wold com such a day with their Dogs, he doubted not but they shold find very Princely sport; So <hi>Conrado</hi> came with his second brother <hi>Cesare,</hi> but <hi>Alexander</hi> could not com till two dayes a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, so the Captain had provided a fitting Supper for the Prince and his brother, who had brought another Noble-man with him to have part of the Sport, the

Prince and the sayd Noble-man lodgd in the Castle, but <hi>Cesare</hi> lay in the Town; The Captain was wonderfull officious to attend the Prince to his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but having confederated with the chiefest of the Garrison in the dead of night they rushd into the Prince his Chamber, and the first thing they did they chopd of his Genitories, then his Head, which they put to stand on a window, and quarterd the rest of his body; This being done very silently, in the morning betimes they sent in the Prince his name for his second brother to com in all hast<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when Prince <hi>Cesare</hi> came, the Captain waited upon him to his brothers Chamber, where the first Object he beheld was <hi>Conrados</hi> head upon a window and his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers quarterd and strewd up and down the Room; ah, sayd <hi>Cesare,</hi> is this the wild Boar you writ of, yes, answered the Captain, but I writ to you of two, so they fell upon <hi>Him</hi> also, and made the like Sacrifice of revenge upon him; this being done the Captain barrd up the Gates, and going upon the walls of the Castle he sent for the chief of the Town, &amp; made a Speech unto them in what sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very they livd in under <hi>Conrado,</hi> therfore if they ever desird liberty there was a fair opportunity offerrd now, because he had <hi>Conrado</hi> in his Custody, and he could do with him what he pleasd; But the Cittizens wold hearken to no such moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, so they sent speedy word to <hi>Alexander</hi> the younger brother, who coming with som Country forces, the Citty joynd with them and beleagurd the Castle, the Captain finding his case to be desperat, takes his wife first on a high Turret and hurld her down amongst them, then his Children, and afterwards murtherd himself in the ey of all the Citty.</p>
               <p>There is no Country swarms with Nobility more then the Kingdom of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> the number wherof do daily encrease, insomuch that the last account which was taken, there were in <hi>Naples, Calabria,</hi> and <hi>Apulia,</hi> with the rest of the twelve Provinces adjoynd, two thousand Barons, fifty Dukes, ninety Marques<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, seventy Earls and five Princes; But som of these Nobles have but slender E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states, as <hi>Aretin</hi> reports, who sayes, that three Marquesses in <hi>Lunigiana</hi> were found eating of Figgs off one Tree to keep them from starving.</p>
