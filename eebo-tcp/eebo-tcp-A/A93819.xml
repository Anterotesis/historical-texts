            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The State of the Caſe depending between ſome of the Inhabitants of <hi>Thames Street</hi> and <hi>Joſiah Child,</hi> touching <hi>Lion-Key,</hi> viz.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He ſaid Perſons in the Name of the City of <hi>London,</hi> (but for their own private advantage onely) have Indicted the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant for ſtopping up the Stairs at <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on-Key</hi> aforeſaid, and a paſſage former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leading down to them; and for plank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over eight foot into the River of <hi>Thames,</hi> and for erecting a Crane upon the ſaid Key, which they ſay are pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Nuſances.</p>
            <p>The Deſendant pleads the general Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue; and for proof ſaith, That the City of <hi>London,</hi> nor any other perſon, hath any thing to do with the ſaid Key, but the ſame is his proper Inheritance in Fee-ſimple, which he can make appear by Legal Conveyances ever ſince the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth: An Abſtract of the Title whereof, is hereunto annexed.</p>
            <p>This the Proſecutors deny not; but they ſay, That <hi>Lion-Key</hi> hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies been a noted and common place for landing and taking water.</p>
            <p>To this the Defendant Replies, and will prove by hundreds of Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, That Wharfige was always paid for every thing ſhipped or landed at <hi>Lion-Key,</hi> though it were but a ſmall Basket that a man carried in his hand, and as much Wharfige as was ever paid at any private <hi>Key</hi> or Stairs in <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That the Paſſage leading down to <hi>Lion-Key,</hi> was always locked up at nights, and upon Sundays and Holydays, and as often as any PRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VATE KEY, or Wharf, or Stairs, between the <hi>Tower of London,</hi> and <hi>London-Bridge,</hi> was locked; and that before the New Gates were crected, which was about fourteen years paſt, there were other Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Gates to the ſaid <hi>Key</hi> and Paſſage, which by computation were above one hundred years ſtanding.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:150300:2"/>
And if the locking up the Paſſage at ſuch times, and the conſtant ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Whatfige do not demonſtrate the Reſervation of the Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and the Incommunity of the ſaid Paſſage and Stairs, then there is no private or proper <hi>Key,</hi> or Wharf, or Stairs between the <hi>Tower</hi> and <hi>London-Bridge:</hi> For that it was never known in the memory of any man living, that ever any Wharfinger hindred any Perſon from Landing or Taking water at his <hi>Key</hi> or <hi>Wharf,</hi> it being the common courteſie of every Wharfinger in <hi>London,</hi> to ſuffer all Perſons that will, to Land or Take water at their Wharfs <hi>gratis,</hi> and ſo they may yet do at <hi>Lion-Key</hi> when they pleaſe, though the Defendant hath his liberty whether to make Stairs or not upon his own ground, and where to make them: But all Wharfingers of private Keys receive from all perſons Whar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fige for what Goods they Ship or Land at their <hi>Keys.</hi> And if this ſhall be conſtrued to prejudice the propriety of the Owners, the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is, that the <hi>City</hi> may with as much Juſtice challenge for common Paſſages all the <hi>Wharfs</hi> in <hi>London;</hi> even thoſe themſelves have let Leaſes of, to the value of ſome thouſand pounds <hi>peranum,</hi> and Indict the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors for altering or leſſening their own Stairs or Crains for their own conveniencies: And alſo all the ways through <hi>Vintner</hi>'s <hi>Houſes,</hi> who for the benefit of their Trades do make Paſſages through their <hi>Taverns;</hi> ſuch as is now Mr. <hi>Wadlows,</hi> at the <hi>Sun</hi> in <hi>Biſhops-gate-ſtreet,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Sawyers</hi> at the <hi>Popes-Head</hi> in St. <hi>Eliens,</hi> and ſuch as was formerly Mr. <hi>Browns</hi> at the <hi>White-Horſe,</hi> in <hi>

                  </gap> ſtreet,</hi> and many more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as well as ſince the Fire, which, notwithſtanding were not, nor ever could be, pretended <hi>COMMON PASSAGES,</hi> becauſe they were locked up at nights by the Owners, being private Perſons: Which the <hi>Kings High-ways</hi> are not. Nor is the <hi>Cuſtome</hi> about <hi>Waies</hi> in all reſpects the ſame in <hi>London</hi> as it is in the Country:</p>
            <p n="3">3. All the <hi>COMMON-STAIRS</hi> are upon the <hi>Cities</hi> own ground; as Owners of the Soil, and not only ſo, but they are, and ever were, erected and repaired at the <hi>Cities charge;</hi> whereas theſe were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways erected and repaired at the charge of the Proprietor or Leffee; and for their own proper uſe and benefit.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Defendant hath a large <hi>Record</hi> to produce out of one of the Courts of Equity, at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> in the eighth Year of <hi>King James,</hi> wherein a Suit was Comenced by Information of Sir <hi>John Brograve</hi> Knight, the <hi>Kings Atturney General: Edward Jeffery</hi> being <hi>Relator</hi> to the ſaid Sir <hi>John,</hi> wherein, the <hi>City</hi> was put upon it, to bring in their Claims and Proofs, what <hi>COMMON</hi> and <hi>OPEN PASSAGES,</hi> or <hi>Stairs,</hi> the <hi>Free-men</hi> of <hi>London</hi> had a Right to make uſe of between the <hi>Tower</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:150300:2"/>
of <hi>London,</hi> and the <hi>Temple.</hi> And to this <hi>Interrogatory,</hi> divers witneſſes then of great age, ſome above fourſcore years, were ſworn and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined on behalf of the <hi>Citizens.</hi> All or moſt of whom in their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, do in the Enumeration of the ſaid <hi>FREE PASSAGES</hi> and <hi>Stairs,</hi> begin with <hi>Tower Dock,</hi> and ſo proceed Weſt-ward as far as <hi>Little Sumers-Key,</hi> and then skip to the other ſide of <hi>London-Bridge</hi> to <hi>Church-yard Alley Stairs;</hi> and not any one of the witneſſes do ſo much as mention <hi>Lion-Key</hi> or Stairs, (which never had any other name) though they omit not any other Stairs or Place between the <hi>Tower</hi> and the <hi>Temple-Stairs,</hi> that the <hi>City</hi> or Free-men of <hi>London</hi> ever did, or now do pretend to, except <hi>Lion-Key</hi> only, which the Proſecutors by crouding their private Intereſts under the Honourable name of the <hi>City,</hi> it ſeems would now ſcrew from the Defendant by right or wrong.</p>
            <p n="5">5. There are ſeveral other <hi>Records</hi> exemplified now in the poſſeſſion of private Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> which do recite all the <hi>COMMON STAIRS,</hi> and Paſſages which the Citizens and Free-men of <hi>London</hi> have anciently claimed a right unto, and not one of them doth ſo much as mention <hi>Lion-Key,</hi> or Stairs.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The City of <hi>London,</hi> who in all ages, hath been deſervedly Famous for keeping exact Regiſters and Records of their Concern's in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, have no memory or account whatſoever to produce, to ſhew that they ever had or did pretend to any right of Paſſage, or Stairs, at <hi>Lion-Key,</hi> although they have of all others which they pretend to, and certainly would have had of this, had they had any right at all there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The Defendants Deeds of Purchaſe, and thoſe by which it was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly bought and ſold, do all mention <hi>Wharfige</hi> to be ſold and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed with <hi>Lion-Key.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond Indictment is; for planking over the <hi>River of Thames</hi> eight foot, and erecting a <hi>Crain</hi> thereupon.</p>
            <p>The Defendant pleads the general Iſſue, and for evidence is ready to prove hy divers credible Witneſſes,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That in the manner it is done, it's no prejudice to the <hi>River</hi> being upon upright Poſts, ſo that the water hath always a free courſe under the ſaid planking.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That he hath not gone beyond the antient bounds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of his former <hi>Wharfe</hi> or <hi>Campſhiot,</hi> but ſeveral poſts of his antient bounds of the former <hi>Campſhiot,</hi> or under Wharf, are yet ſtanding, and were never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, which are now the outermoſt poſts or ſtakes of the ſaid work into the <hi>River.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:150300:3"/>
3. That moreover he had the conſent of the late <hi>Lord Mayor</hi> for what he did, who was <hi>pro illud Vice,</hi> under his <hi>Majeſty, Conſervator</hi> of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of <hi>Thames.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. That for further certainty the Defendant petitioned the <hi>Kings moſt Excellent Majeſty</hi> for his permiſſion, who was pleaſed to Refer the conſideration of the Defendants Petition to three of his <hi>Majeſties own Surveyors,</hi> and the two <hi>City Surveyors,</hi> or any three of them, who were the proper Officers by <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> for Regulating and Staking out all Buildings within <hi>London:</hi> Which ſaid Surveyors made the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Certificate to his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> upon ſight of which Certificate, the ſaid late <hi>Lord Mayor</hi> conſented to the Defendants going forward with his Work, though he had before forbidden him.</p>

            <p>By what hath been alleadged on the Defendants part, and will be fully proved by very many Witneſſes of great Age and Quality, as well emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> as others, it appears the Defendant hath not onely done what Lawfully he might have done upon his own Inheritance, but hath proceeded with Caution, and all due Reſpect and Humility to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Honourable City of <hi>London.</hi>

            <p>For further certainty wherein, the ſaid Commiſſioners did with the approbation of the late <hi>Lord Mayor</hi> of the <hi>City of London,</hi> employ ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Artificers and Surveyors to <hi>ſtake out the Lines for building at the aforeſaid diſtance of forty Foot</hi> from the <hi>River,</hi> for direction of all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in laying their <hi>Foundations,</hi> and carrying on their work of Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and did likewiſe preſcribe the Order and Form for <hi>Cranes.</hi> In exact conformity whereunto, the Defendant hath proceeded to the erecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of one <hi>double Crain,</hi> and divers large <hi>Ware-houſes</hi> on <hi>Lion-Key</hi> afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, which coſt him upwards of <hi>Two thouſand Pounds,</hi> and in the ſame manner likewiſe, and in obedience to the ſame Authority, have all other Owners of Wharfs between <hi>London-Bridge,</hi> and <hi>Billings-gate</hi> already carried forth their <hi>Wharfs,</hi> with Planks, <hi>viz.

own ends; is, <hi>ab incomodo,</hi> they ſay it is very inconvenient to the <hi>City,</hi> that the Stairs at <hi>Lion-Key</hi> ſhould be taken away; though in truth the inconvenience be only to twelve or fourteen of themſelves, whoſe Shops are near, or do adjoyn to the entrance thereof.</p>
            <p>This Argument, if there were any thing in it of truth, avails nothing in Law or Equity, to diveſt the Defendant of his propriety. But it is ſo far from truth in reſpect to the <hi>City</hi> in general, that there is in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, nothing in it but noiſe and clamour: For about fifteen Paces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the ſaid <hi>Lion-Key, viz.</hi> at Little <hi>Summers-Key</hi> are a <hi>free pair of Stairs,</hi> which are the <hi>Cities</hi> own Stairs, and two pair more juſt below them at <hi>Billings-gate,</hi> beſides which, the Lay-Stall at <hi>Billings-gate,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now removed, there is a moſt convenient place for erecting of a decent uſeful pair of Stairs above twice as large as thoſe formerly at <hi>Lion-Key;</hi> But then indeed, part of the Retail Trade of the Water-men will by reaſon of the ſaid new erected Stairs, remove eight or ten Shops more Eaſt-ward in <hi>Thames-ſtreet;</hi> the fear whereof, is in truth the only cauſe of all this buſtle, whatever elſe is pretended.</p>
            <p>From all which, it evidently appears, that by this alteration the <hi>City of London</hi> will receive no Diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Trade or Conveniencies: For that little Retail Trade which may be loſt in one part, will be fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gained in another part of the ſame Street; Beſides the greater advantage which will and doth already ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crew to <hi>Merchants,</hi> in the Loading and Landing of Goods, by reaſon of that rational, uſeful, uniforme, and comely Order, in which all the <hi>Keys</hi> and <hi>Wharfs</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> are now moſt prudently eſtabliſhed, by his Majeſties Commiſsioners aforeſaid.</p>
