         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Poor Robin's
True Character of a SCOLD.</head>
            <p>A Rank SCOLD is a Devil of the
Feminine gender; a <hi>Serpent,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually
hiſſing, and ſpitting of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom;
a Compoſition of <hi>Ill-nature</hi>
and <hi>Clamour.</hi> You may call her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimated
<hi>Gun-powder,</hi> a walking Mount <hi>Aetna</hi> that
is always belching forth flames of Sulphur, or a
Real <hi>Purgatory,</hi> more to be dreaded in this world,
than the Popes Imaginary <hi>Hot-houſe</hi> in the next.
A <hi>Burr</hi> about the Moon, is not half ſo certain a
Preſage of a <hi>Tempeſt</hi> at Sea, as her <hi>Brow</hi> is of a
Storm on Land. And though <hi>Laurel, Haw-thorn,</hi>
and <hi>Seal-skin</hi> are held Preſervatives againſt <hi>Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
Magick has not yet been able to finde any
<hi>Amulet</hi> ſo Sovereign as to ſtill her Ravings: for,
like Oyl pour'd on Flames, Good words do but
make her Rage the faſter; and when once her
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95637:3"/>
Flag of Defiance, the Tippet, is unfurl'd, ſhe
cares not a ſtraw for Conſtable nor Cucking-ſtool.</p>
            <p>Her Tongue is the <hi>Clapper</hi> of the Devil's
<hi>Saints-bell,</hi> that rings <hi>all-in</hi> to Confuſion: It runs
round-like a Wheel, one ſpoak after another, and
makes more <hi>Noiſe and Jangling,</hi> than Country-Steeples
on the Fifth of <hi>November.</hi> She is never
leſs at <hi>eaſe,</hi> than when ſhe is <hi>quiet;</hi> never <hi>quiet,</hi> but
when ſhe is <hi>ſleeping;</hi> nor then neither: for either
ſhe <hi>talks</hi> in her Dream, or awakes the whole houſe
with a terrible fit of <hi>Snoring.</hi> She makes ſuch a
Pattering with her Lips when ſhe walks the ſtreets,
as if ſhe were <hi>poſſest;</hi> ſo indeed ſhe is, with
the <hi>ſpirit of Contention.</hi> The <hi>Dog-days,</hi> with
her, continue all the year round; nor can ſhe
poſſibly take <hi>Cold</hi>: for ſhe is ever <hi>in an Heat,</hi>
and holds neither <hi>Pox</hi> nor <hi>Plague</hi> ſo grievous a
Diſeaſe, as being <hi>Tongue-ty'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>She makes an Aſs of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and demonſtrates,
That though every <hi>man</hi> be, yet many a <hi>woman</hi>
is not, <hi>A ſociable Creature:</hi> for there is no Good
humour can charm her to be Civil or Agreeable;
no Company, how affable or compaiſant ſoever,
that can long content her. She ſeeks occaſions
for Railing, as eagerly as a Common Barretor does
to go to Law. If you will not anger her, ſhe
will be angry with you for thus neglecting her:
and you cannot vex her worſe, than to be ſilent,
unleſs you ſing or whiſtle at her Folly. She in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprets
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95637:3"/>
all ſhe hears in the worſt ſenſe, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
the defect of real Affronts with jealous <hi>ſus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitions.</hi>
She is more <hi>captious,</hi> than <hi>capable</hi> of
Offence; and all her Neighbours bleſs themſelves
from her, wiſhing this <hi>Quotidian Feaver</hi> of her
Tongue cur'd with a Razor. Yet is not that her
onely weapon; for ſhe has Hands to Clap with,
and Nails to Scratch with, and Teeth to Bite
with, and much more Furniture for War; ſo that
being lookt upon as Invincible, her bad humour
gets her a <hi>Priviledge:</hi> for where-ever ſhe comes,
ſhe may be ſure to have the <hi>Room</hi> to her ſelf; nor
needs long Conteſt for priority of <hi>Walk,</hi> or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency
at <hi>Table,</hi> or opinion in Argument: for
the <hi>proudeſt Goſſip</hi> will quit Pretenſions, rather
than ſtand the <hi>ſhock</hi> of her well-known <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If ſhe be of the preciſer Caſt, ſhe abuſes <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Language</hi> in her Railing, as Conjurers do in
their Charms; calls her Neighbours <hi>Heathen E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domites,</hi>
her Huſband, <hi>Reprobate,</hi> or <hi>Son of Belial,</hi>
and will not <hi>cudgel</hi> her Maid without a Text
for't. But now I ſpeak of Huſband, methinks I
ſee the <hi>creeping ſnail</hi> ſhivering in an Ague fit
when he comes in her preſence. She is worſe
than Cow-itch in his Bed, and as good as a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing-diſh
at Board: but has either quite <hi>forgot</hi>
his <hi>Name,</hi> or elſe ſhe <hi>likes</hi> it not; which makes
her <hi>Rebaptize</hi> him with more noble Titles, as
<hi>White-liver'd Raskal, Drunken Sot, Sneaking
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95637:4"/>
Ninkompoop,</hi> or <hi>pitiful lowſy Tom Farthing,</hi> Thus
ſhe worries him out of his ſenſes at home, and
then ferrets his Haunts abroad worſe than a needy
Bawd does a decay'd Bully's. Taverns and Ale-houſes
dread her ſingle Alarm, more than the
joynt Attaques of the Conſtable and Watch; and
his Companions are content to pay his Club and
diſmiſs him, on news of her approach, rather
than be at the charge of ſo many Glaſſes and
Bottles as ſhe will quickly ſalute his Coxcomb
with. A full Glaſs ſeaſonably offered, may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
pacifie her for a moment; but immediately
the Ill ſpirit returns, and ſhe can be quiet onely
juſt ſo long as ſhe is drinking. Thus ſhe clamours
at him ſo long without occaſion, that at laſt he
gives her enough; and rails at him for keeping
Ill Company, till ſhe forces him to it; being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham'd
to go into any Good Society, or they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham'd
of him; which makes him ſeek blinde
Bubbing-ſchools to hide himſelf in from her fury,
and reſolve to ſtay out all Night, rather than en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
a double Rally.</p>
            <p>In a word, (for I perceive our Character begins
to be infected with the contagious Talkativeneſs
of its ſubject) a <hi>virulent Scold</hi> is her Neighbours
perpetual Diſquiet, her Families Evil Genius, her
Huſbands Ruine, and her own dayly Tormentor:
And that you may the better know her Pedigree,
I'll give you a ſerious Account of the Receipt or
Method made uſe of for her Production into the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95637:4"/>
world, lately found in a long-concealed Manuſcript
of <hi>Theophraſtus Bombaſtus Paracelſus,</hi> as follows:
<hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That Nature long ſince finding many of her
Sons oft-times bewitcht to their own Ruine by
the Charms of Women, for their puniſhment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd
this Monſter call'd <hi>A Scold:</hi> To form which,</p>
            <p>She firſt took of the Tongues and Galls of Bulls,
Bears, Wolves, Magpies, Parrets, Cuckows, and
Nightingales, of each a like number: The Tongues
and Tails of Vipers, Adders, Snakes and Lizards,
Seven apiece: Aurum Fulminans, Aqua Fortis
and Gun-powder, of each one pound: The Clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
of Nineteen Bells, and the Peſtles of a dozen
Apothecaries Mortars. Which being all mixt, ſhe
calcin'd in Mount <hi>Strombelo,</hi> and diſſolv'd the
Aſhes in a water diſtill'd juſt under <hi>London</hi>-bridge
at three quarters Flood, and filtrated it through
the leaves of <hi>Calepines</hi> Dictionary, to render the
Operation more verbal. After which, ſhe diſtill'd
it again through a Speaking-Trumpet, and cloſed
up the remaining Spirits in the mouth of a Cannon.
Then ſhe open'd the Graves of all new-deceaſed
Pettifoggers, Mountebanks, Barbers, Coffee-news-mongers,
and Fiſh-wives; and with the ſkin of
their Tongues, made a Bladder cover'd o're with
Drum-heads, and fill'd with Storms, Tempeſts,
Whirlwinds, Thunders, Lightnings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe,
for better Incorporation, ſhe ſet ſeven years in a
rough Sea to ferment, and then mixing them with
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95637:5"/>
the reſt, rectified the whole three times a day for
a Twelve month in a Balneo of Quick-ſilver.
Laſtly, to irrabiate the whole Elixir, and make it
more Churliſh, ſhe cut a vein under the Tongue
of the Dog-ſtar, drawing thence a pound of the
moſt Cholerick blood; from which ſublimating
the Spirits, ſhe mixt them with the Foam of a
mad Dog: and then putting all together in the
forementioned Bladder, ſtitcht it up with the
Nerves of <hi>Socrates</hi>'s Wife.</p>
            <p>Out of this noble Preparation, and a <hi>Crooked
Rib</hi> (Emblem of future Croſneſs) Dame Nature
firſt compoſed a SHREW, whoſe Poſterity
(as is frequent with noxious Animals) has ſince
ſo over-ſpread the world, that ſcarce an <hi>Alley</hi> or
<hi>Village</hi> is free from ſome of her Lineage.</p>
            <p>But that you may ſee her End as well as Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
