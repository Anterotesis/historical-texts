            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

heare it from others, nor too easily believe it; spend thy time rather in pressing forward to what thou should'st be, than in idely contemplating or conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thy selfe with what thou art; think meanly of thy selfe, and that thought will both make thee mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest (for he that suspects himselfe is not bold) and eager in the pursuit of that goodnesse or knowledge wherein thou supposest thy selfe defective; be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy rather to give, than to take an applause; and if thou art apt to thinke thou deservest well, check it,

with thinking how many deserve better.</p>
            <p>Let thy thoughts bee such to thy selfe, that if it should be suddenly ask'd, what thou think'st on, thou mightest not blush to tell; stifle sin in the first warmth and quickning, before it shape too far: a twig may bee pluckt up with one hand, which the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy cannot wag, when it is a tree; even evill thoughts are evill, and though yet they bee not, yet cherish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, will spread into evill actions.</p>

no occasion of exceptions thy selfe, and doe not easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take exceptions at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and bee ready to make satisfaction to those that have just exceptions against thee; it is a greater vertue to forgive one inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, than to doe many cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesies; because it is harder: and it is harder, because more against nature; for many a man will doe for another, that wil not suffer for him; therefore it is a greater perfection to bee contented to suffer, than to be willing to doe, unlesse it bee to doe for those of whom we have suffered,

mens discourse; but with paines and industry rather to search out the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of truth thy selfe, than lazily to take it up from others.</p>
            <p>In Religion examine, but not broach opinions; ever incline to Antiquity, and suspect novelty; in middle things ever submit to the Authority thou livest un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and let the Churches opinion be thine.</p>
            <p>Measure not equity and right by friends and profit, nor doe wrong, either to get, or to do a curtesie; not upbraid others with the kindnesses thou doest for

            <p>Be not wilfull nor wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, not change but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on good reason, not obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate against reason; not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve every report, not to report every thing thou believest; not grant every thing which thou canst not answer, but suspect rather thine owne insufficiency that cannot defend it, than cry down the matter as not to be defended.</p>

onely of a good conscience; doe not mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure thy selfe by other mens reports, nor measure other men by thy selfe; ask thine owne heart, and not their tongues, what thou art.</p>
            <p>Labour to reforme thy selfe first, let other mens sins rather be the subject of thy griefe, than of thy discourse; so speake of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens sins, as that thou detract not from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; and so excuse or miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the slip of any person, as that thou seeme not to countenance the sin.</p>

            <p>Say nothing but what thou meanest, and promise nothing but what thou art able; not to intend what thou speakest, is to give thy heart the lye with thy tongue; not to performe what thou promisest, is to give thy tongue the lye with thy actions.</p>
            <p>Doe not greedily finde fault in any, nor reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully publish it; but rather by a hidden and oblique way to insinuate his errour

the one, and a cup of cold water in the other thou canst not be without.</p>
            <p>When thou promisest, think thou mayest be taken at thy word; be nothing in a complement, which thou darest not stand to in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest: as there is lesse sin, so there is lesse wrong in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying than in not perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming; to deny is at most but a discurtesie; not to performe is an injury; for if thou denyest, hee may seeke to others; if thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivest he fails of all; it is lawfull for thee not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, it is not lawfull for thee to breake promise.</p>

his ill deserving, is a duty, yet a commendations; to thinke obedience a vertue, not servitude, and that it is not the least mastery, so far to command ones selfe, as to be contented to submit to the commands of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>Doe curtesies for others as gifts, not looking for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitall; receive curtesies of others as loanes, and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to repay; what fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours thou doest for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to forget them; if thou receivest any, ever to remember them; not to requite the injuries of an enemy with the like, nor

            <p>In place of judicature, looke not whose cause comes before thee, but what; and judge even thy brother, not as a brother, but a Iudge; not measure

            <p>Be milde to all, but know when to be severe; there is an unseasonable meekness: I know not which is worse, to be angry unjustly, or not to be justly angry; if by the first thou mayest wrong an innocent person, by the other thou mayest a guilty; sometime to be silent at, is to encourage a fault; it may be a due chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding would reforme that offence which takes heart with sufferance.</p>

            <p>Love, but not bee fond of the body; to love it is a duty, to be fond of it is a sin; let the fare bee such as may neither impaire the health of it, nor the devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;

the apparell neat, not chargeable, not mimically in, nor ridiculously out of fashion; such as may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with thy estate, thy yeares, thy profession; not at all to invent, and slowly to take up a fashion, and that rather because thou would'st not be singular, than because thou likest it, and as may shew thee wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be constant, but not obstinate.</p>
            <p>Let thy recreations bee short and diverting, such as may rather fit thee for bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse, than rob thee of time; long and tedious sports do rather take away

            <p>Learne not to thinke of the things of this world as of things of continuance; and to use the things of this world, not as an own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but a Steward; so thou wilt bee neither loth to leave them, nor afraid to

thou knowest any good thing of him, tell it others; if any ill, or vice, tell it himselfe; so by telling o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of his good parts, thou wilt procure for him a good opinion; and by telling him and admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing him of his faults, thou wilt make him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve that good opinion.</p>
            <p>Abstaine not only from ill, but from the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of it, lest thou heare ill undeservedly, or doe ill unawares.</p>
            <p>Let thy discourse be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther light nor unseasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; such as may call either thy goodnesse in question,

            <p>Thinke meanly of thine owne sufficiency, though others thinke not so; look much upon thy defects, and little upon thy good parts; and think that thou art short, not only of what thou oughtst, but of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; that that which thou know'st, is nothing to that of which thou art igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant; and therefore to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour rather truly to know thy selfe, than to make

            <p>Scorn not to be better'd by the good example of others, and be carefull not to make others worse with thine; do nothing in which thou would'st not be imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated; and imitate nothing which thou know'st is not fit to be done; it is a fault to do what thou should'st not, it is none, to learne what thou should'st doe of any.</p>
            <p>Thinke in the morning what thou hast to do this day, and at night what thou hast done; and doe nothing upon which thou

mayest not boldly aske Gods blessing; nor (as neer as thou canst) nothing for which thou shalt need to ask his pardon; let thy first care be, not to do ill; thy next care to repent of it; account often with thy selfe, thy last account will be the lesse, be not afraid to looke upon thy score, but be afraid to increase it; to despaire because thou art sinfull, is to be worse, because thou hast beene so bad.</p>

in shew only, yet shew it in thy practise; think no sinne little; nor no good which thou doest great, it is from the acceptance of God that it is good at all; hope for, but not challeng a reward of thy wel doing, yet not for it selfe, but for what Christ hath done; measure thy selfe not by what others are, but by what thou oughtest to be; remember thy sinnes with griefe, and thy goodnesse, the one, for that thou hast beene so bad, the other, that thou canst be no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and though thou canst not attaine to perfection

            <p>Labour not only to know what thou shouldst bee (that most men doe) but to be so; nor at all to know what other men are; thou shalt not answer for it; be carefull, if thou canst, to make others better by thy good counsell, or at least, not to make them worse by thy example.</p>
            <p>Be ever contented with thy present estate, but, if thou canst, better it; do not corruptly thrust thy selfe into any place; and being in, doe nothing that may thrust thee out; make the execution of thy office,

            <p>Doe not make any sinne lesse by custome; for as men doe at first lesse like sinne, so with continuance they doe lesse feele it; as those that are accustomed to carry burdens, are lesse sensible of the weight; and

if thou doest now the same things with more ease, doe not thinke that the sinne is more light, but that thou art more hardned; and thy case is so much more des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, by how much want of sense is neerer to death, than paine; feeling is an argument of life, thou art a dead member if thou hast lost thy feeling; but here's the misery, that thou hast lost thy feeling in regard of sin, but not of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Fix thy desires upon such things as may not shame thee in the obtaining; and compasse thy desires by

such meanes as may not shame thee to own; though that which thou seekest for be good, yet while the way by which thou seekest for it is evill, thou shamest the end by the way; and shamest thy self in the end.</p>
            <p>Thinke no sin little, and make it not great by itera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; what is a Mountaine of earth, but an accumula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of many little dusts?

            <p>Think of death as a thing thou must meet with; and of thy life, as a thing thou must part with; and not to love too well that life, that keepes thee from a better; nor at al to feare that death that leads thee to a better life; this life is a journey, and the world an uneasie horse, that with much jol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and some fals, brings you to your home, and why art thou unwilling to alight; love rather that pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage that leads to eternall happinesse, than that life
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:28309:29"/>
which keepes thee from it, and not without continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all misery.</p>
            <p>Study rather to make thy selfe fit for any em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment and place, than to thinke thy selfe so; and be preferred by thy desert, not by purchase; slip no lawfull meanes to doe thy selfe good, and use no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull; he which grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth great by buying, doth likely continue that great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse by selling.</p>
            <p>Measure thy wealth by thy minde, not by thy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state; a contented minde is ever rich; but measure thy expence by thy estate,

not by thy minde; not what thou would'st doe, but what thou art able to doe; think not frugality a disparagement, nor out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run thy selfe to keepe pace with others; this is to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure that which thou fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest; and lest thou shouldst be thought meane, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come so; many times a slow pace performes that journey, whil'st gallo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping tyres by the way.</p>
            <p>Let thy thoughts bee such to thy selfe, as thou art asham'd to have God know them; and thy words such to God, as thou art not afraid to have men
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:28309:30"/>
heare them; and let thy whole life be such toward God and Man, as that thou neither dishonour God by thy il life, nor draw others to the same dishonour of him by thy ill example.</p>
            <p>Pleasure not thy selfe by wronging others; nor with the unjust Steward, make thee friends with other mens monies; left while thou would'st buy other friends, thou fell GOD; come<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to promotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if thou canst by friends, not by money; if thou deservest it not, thou wrongest o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; if thou dost deserve it, thou wrongest thy selfe.</p>

               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:28309:31"/>The goodnesse of the minde, is witnessed in the outward actions; the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the outward acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is determined by the intention and minde; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward goodnesse without outward showes of it, is like a Tree without fruit, uselesse; &amp; outward shewes of goodnesse without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward sincerity, is like a Tree without heart, live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse; that thou art good inwardly in thy heart, is thine owne comfort; that thou dost outwardly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse this goodnesse in thy life, is others benefit; thou thy selfe are not the better

for that goodnesse which thou dost not make shew of, others are not the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for that goodnesse of w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> thou makest no shew; so inward sincerity is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in respect of God, outward profession onely in respect of men; by the first thou art a true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian; by the other it doth appeare that thou art so.</p>
            <p>Neither undertake much, nor talke much, and that to the purpose; deliver thy minde rather in profitable language, than curious; by this, happily, thou wilt gaine more applause, but by the other thou wilt doe

more good, and it is a grea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter vertue to do well, than to heare well.</p>
            <p>Do nothing which thou disallowest; disallow thy selfe some things w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> thou mayest doe, but nothing which thou oughtst to do; give no liberty to thy selfe in unlawfull things; use not the utmost of that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty which is given thee in other things; and so use thy liberty in what thou art permitted, as that they may not hinder thee in the things thou art comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
            <p>Promise nothing which may prejudice thee in the

performance; performe what thou hast promised, though to thy prejudice; thinke thy selfe bound by thy word, though without oath or witnesse; if thou art not well able to per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>forme, consider thou wert able not to promise; a good man measurs his promises by his ability, but he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures his performance by his promise.</p>
            <p>Account it the greatest knowledge truly to know thy selfe; and the greatest co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quest to subdue thy self; not give way to thine own lusts; nor boast of thine owne parts; to do nothing

that is ill, nor vaine glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously to tell of what thou doest well; in all things to approve thy selfe a good man and a Christian, but not boast of it.</p>
            <p>Place not Religion in talke only; it is an easier matter to give counsell, than to follow it; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times wee have knowne men to fall into those sins from which they have with great paines conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted others; but Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (as we say of Charity) begins at home; it was <hi>Christs</hi> to S. <hi>Peter, Art thou converted? strengthen the brethren,</hi> but first be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted

            <p>Measure not goodnesse by good workes onely: a Parrat may be taught to speake well; good words cost us nothing; and men are for that Religion that is cheapest; it is an easie matter to speake like a Christian; Satan himselfe can talke Scripture; Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity consists not barely in knowing, or discoursing of what is good, but in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctising what we do know; in Religion not to doe as thou sayest, is to unsay thy Religion in thy deeds.</p>

            <p>In point of reformation, first pluck out thy owne More; spend not thy time in exhorting others to the

            <p>Reckon nothing which thou hast, thine owne; nor nothing which thou doest, at thine owne disposing; and use all, not as a Master,

            <p>Do not murmure at thy condition, if meane; nor measure Gods blessings by thy wants, but by thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts; if God be better to others than he is to thee, yet while hee is better to thee than thou deservest, he is good enough.</p>

            <p>It is the goodnesse of God to us, that is the cause of the love of God to us; and it is the goodnesse of God in us, that is the cause of the love of God in us; confesse that the good w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> thou receivest is not for thine owne sake, nor the good which thou doest is not by thine owne power; it is the mercy of God that moves him to doe for us; that inables us to doe that which pleaseth him.</p>

him that may erre, will be sure in some things to fall into errour.</p>
            <p>Call to thy minde often what thou hast done; and then compare with it what thou hast suffered; &amp; what thou hast received; and when thou shalt finde, that thou hast received more good than thou hast done; and hast done more evill than thou hast suffered; fear that there is lesse good behinde for thee, and more evill; and therefore betake thee to repentance, and a new life; and by that thou mayest prevent the evill which thou hast deserved

            <p>Let it not trouble thee that some others have livd longer than thy selfe; not the length of thy life, but the goodnesse is the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of thy happinesse; if thou hast lived well, thou hast lived long enough; if thou hast not lived well, thou hast lived too long.</p>
            <p>Never think it too soon to repent, thou doest not know how soon thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est dye, and after death it is too late; he that puts off

            <p>Think that in death thou dost not lose a life, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change one; death is but a change; and therefore not to feare a change, that art every day so acquainted with changes; every chang is a kinde of death, in as much as that which it changeth from, doth die to what it was; if the beasts and creatures themselves did not change from what they are, how should we be fed? Nay, if their skins and clothing did not change from it's naturall use to them, how could it be usefull to us; if the Sun

it selfe did not change his place; if the yeere, and the parts of the yeere, did not change, how should wee either have life or necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries? thou then that doest thus subsist by changes, why doest thou feare a change? especially consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that other things being ever altering in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
