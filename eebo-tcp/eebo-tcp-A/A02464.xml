         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Christian Reader.</head>
            <p>EXperience hath taught me (gentle Reader) that it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry daungerous in this trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some age to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitt any thyng to Printe for thy behoofe. So farreforth hath that frettyng ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ker of carping curiosity pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed: So busily pryeth in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery Printers shoppe that way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward churle <hi>Zoilus</hi>: So diuers and variable are the wittes and dispositions of our age, readyer to breake downe open roades thorough other mens hedges, then to stoppe neuer so little a gappe with any frythe of their owne. To such be it aunswered, that the greatest barkers be not commonly the best byters: and it falleth out for the more parte, that such bytesheepe curres smell of the cud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell, when the gentle houndes feede of the croomes. And so I leaue them to them selues, whose sinister Iudgement as I litle regarde, so I groape not after their prayse. Onely my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose is to profitt the vnlettered English men: Emongest whom the gentle natured will interprete the best, and findyng ought amisse, will with courtesie rather correct (I trust) then with carpyng condemne the course of my labours, for whose onely behoofe and benefitt I aduentured vpon this translation, and published the same in Printe. Some bytternesse of speache will now and then occurre, which at the first blushe may happely breede some offence. But if we call to remembraunce the sharpenes of speach, vttered by kyng Dauid, by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle Paule, and by all the holy ones them selues almost, in their feruencie of zeale, agaynst the Enemies of God, and aduersaries
<pb facs="tcp:3766:3"/>
of the Crosse of Christ, this offence will be lesse offensiue in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the opposed aduersary, whose mouth ruffleth and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth ouer euery where, with more then Ruffianlike and rascal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like tearmes agaynst our most dread Souereigne, agaynst her highnesse Nobilitie, agaynst her subiectes, and the whole state of her most gracious Gouerneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, to the vtter defacing of the Gospell of Grace: which no true harted Englishman can endure to Read without greeuous anguishe of mynde. This licentious lauishenesse of rayling tounge sithence outraged so monstruous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, was conuenient to be mette withal with some libertie of free speache: That so the gentle Prelate, beyng otherwise squeymishe to heare shrewde wordes, might hereafter learne to wryte more modestly, and more beseemyng his Pastorall dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie and functio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and geaue lesse occasion of iust reproche. The rest I commende to thy gentle consideration, requiryng none other guerdon at thy handes for my trauaile, then thy frendly acceptaunce, and some spare of thyne idle tyme, to be employed in perusing for thy better instruction. So shalt thou encourage me (as knowledge shall increase and oportunitie serue) to acquaynte the with the fruites of the rest of my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, Which I shall hereafter vndertake by the conduct of Gods holy Spirite: who enlighten thyne hart with spirituall vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng, to the glory of his name, and the establishement of thy Fayth, Farewell.</p>

            <p>IT might iustly be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered (right honorable) that in this so bright a Sunneshyne of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of Grace, so plenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ouerspreading this noble Island with such resplendisau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t beames, so many Englishe <hi>Endi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mions</hi> could co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue so long, so amazedly dazeled of sight, as not to be able to lift vpp the eyes of their sleepy affections to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue, much lesse to pearce into the amyable closettes thereof: If the old auncient Enemy of mankynd, and sworne aduersary of all true Religion, were not more vigilaunt to lulle in securitie, then those sluggardes are willyng to be awakened out of their lamentable blindnes. For if we behold the most happy course of this our floorishing continuaunce in sincere Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if we ponder with vpright ballaunce of vnstayned affection, the glorious manifestation of the auncient Apostolicke doctrine, &amp; withall looke into the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelous discouery of that counterfaict Synagogue of Rome, who could not but wonder at so blockishe in

Great is the God of Israell, and maruelous in his workes. He it is, who by the onely touche of a small rodde,

deuided the readd Sea, and made the same to become drye lande, and a passable way for his people, retour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng the waues thereof vpon the pursuyng Enemy, to the vtter ouerthrowe of Pharao, his Charettes, and all his hoaste. He it is, that gaue the headd of that stought warriour Holofernes into the handes of a seely woman. He it is, that caused the rodd of Aaron to eate vpp all the roddes of thenchauntours, and Sorcerers of Egipt. He it is, that with the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly breath of his mouth hath daunted the insolencie of this Popishe challenger, who beyng esteemed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest our Englishe Papistes, the most notable Prelate of our Age, is now by the hand of a weake Englishe Pastour discouered in his colours, to be nought els, then a vayne bablyng Rhetorician full of wordes, altogether voyde of matter.</p>
            <p>All which notwithstanding, such is the malicious peruersenes of the world, that he onely &amp; alone bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the price, and carryeth the greatest creditt and estimation of all the writers of our tyme, euery whose sentence is reputed an Oracle from heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: The odde man of the whole world Ierome Osorius: not able to be aunswered, much lesse to be confused by any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testaunt whatsoeuer.

For he right well perceaued, though Osorius roaued at England by name, that yet he bent his shotte agaynst the generall state of all Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, and therefore most necessary, that as Osorius made his challenge knowen to the whole world, so the world also might be made acquainted with the encounter (I would haue sayd) the vtter ouerthrow of the same. The benefite whereof, though haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounded to many particuler persons within this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alme, yet hath not bene so vniuersall, as was neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in respect of the multitude, who onely regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng the name and fame of the man, will (as I sayd before) scarsely be persuaded, that he may possibly be aunswered.</p>

            <head>¶ To the most Renowmed and Puissaunt Prince Sebastian king of Portingall euerlasting grace, peace, and most prosperous Reigne in our Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ.</head>
            <p>IF I hadd vndertaken this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise, not beyng enduced more of earnest co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sideration of the cause I take in hand, and present neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie of the tyme, then of any allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rement of priuate commoditie, or presumptuous oftentation, or vayneglorious persuation of mynde (most Renowmed and vertuous Prince kyng Sebastian) I should not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haue bene accoumpted blameworthy in the Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all the godly, but also haue willfully plunged my selfe into deserued obloquy of all the world: that beyng a poore despised abiect, a seely wretched vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng, so meere a straunger, and so farre seuered from you by distaunce of place, without all maner of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintaunce either of name, or of Title, neither called nor co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded by any desert, nor by any person co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded hereunto, dare so boldly presume to write vnto your highnesse beyng the mirrour of all Princely dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie. But as the occasion that moued me to attempt your Maiestie, seemed of no small importaunce: so the oportunitie of the matter it selfe yelded vnto me no lesse euident Argument of assured affiaunce and auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie (though in vtter apparaunce vnseemely) yet par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable (I trust) vpon due examination of the cause. And yet besides this alleadged necessitie emplyeng reasonable excuse, I wanted not many others as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable aydes to defend my enterprise, if like exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb facs="tcp:3766:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
applyed in like cause may be allowable. For if Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome Osorius beyng as then but a priuate man, no lesse estraunged from the Societie of this common weale of ours, then a professed Enemy to the Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which we embrace in Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, prouoked either of some vayne glorious oftentatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or of greedy desire to maintayne his owne Religion, and to deface ours, vnder zeale of pretensed good will and affection borne, durst be so bold not onely to write so long and tedious an Epistle to our most Royall excellent Queene Elizabeth, but also so vnprouokedly to aduertize her highnes of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters inconuenient, daungerous to her soules health: why should I be condemned of insolency? if inflamed with sincere inclinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of most humble dutie towardes the most valiaunt Prince Sebastian kyng of Portingall, no lesse famous in Princely vertues, then valiau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of power, if allured by the notable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porte of his incomparable bounty, do send most hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble greetyng in the Lord Iesu, in two or three wordes to his Maiestie, in recommendyng his highnesse to the gracious protection of the allmightie, with no lesse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of perfect peace and tranquillitie to him and his by Letter, then inwardly I wishe to his Maiesty fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the bottome of my hart. Neither do I see any reason to the contrary, why I should be more embraced in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceipte, and driue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from my endeuour, hauyng so many notable commendations vttered by euery godly personadge in the behalfe of the famous kyng Sebastian, Renowmed in eche Coast for his excellencie in prowesse, and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesse in dignitie: sithence Osorius through the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saunt blast of the Trompe of fame, hath presumed so farre vpon the vnspeakable clemency of our Queenes most excellent Maiestie, whom he neuer sawe: when as also her highnesse of her aboundaunt grace hath with
<pb facs="tcp:3766:8"/>
so great lenitie entertayned the Letters of Osorius, and so gently perused them (though otherwise perhappes vnworthy so noble a personadge) why should not I persuade my selfe to obteine as much, yea more rather of your Princely magnificence, and heroicall clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, especially sithence it cann not be credible that kyng Sebastian beyng a man, cann any ioate be inferiour to Elizabeth a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Queene, in any Princely orname<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes or dutie of Humanitie?</p>
            <p>But there will some peraduenture be founde not farre from emongest vs, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this comparison which I do make betwixt vs two Osorius and me, will seeme in no respect agreable: for as much as he beyng a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunt frend to the true and Catholicke Churche (as they will alleadge) doth take vpon him a most comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

This Obiection is no new thyng, &amp; whereof I haue long agoe well &amp; aduisedly debated with my selfe, yea the very selfe same thyng (most Royall kyng) wherein I am become at this prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t your Maiesties most humble Suppliaunt, and whereof I determined to beseech your highnesse in the bowels of our Lord God (whose aucthoritie and person you do represent in your Realme) that ye would vouchsafe due consideration, Ierome Osorius Byshop of Syluain ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng and enforcing all his knowledge and skill agaynst
<pb facs="tcp:3766:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the professed doctrine of our Religion publiquely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued in England, hath published in Printe three fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Libelles vnder the Title of an Aunswere to Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Haddon: for Reply wherof we haue framed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng to our slender capacitie this Apology, how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniently to the purpose I haue not to say, to what suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse it will come, is in the handes of the Lord, surely for the garnishment of phrase and Stile thereof I haue no great regard. For this our contention tendeth not to the blazyng of excellency in eloquence, neither treate we here of the delicacy and finesse of speach, neither descant we lyke Minstrelles of warblyng of stringes, ne yet tosse we our questions to and fro in vaunt of brauery of witte, Sophisters vse to argue of moates in the Sunne in their triflyng and Dunsticall Schooles: But we dispute as Deuines in matters of greatest importaunce, of true righteousnes, of the way to eternall saluation, and euerlastyng damnation, and of the true woshippyng of allmighty God. This Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy or Aunswere to the quarrellsome and slau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derous reproches of Osorius, how simple soeuer it appeare, we haue thought for no man so meete to be presented, as to your Maiestie (most excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t kyng Sebastian) whom we most humbly craue and desire to be both a wittnes and a Iudge of the controuersie.</p>
            <p>As for the questions wherewith Osorius doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueigh agaynst vs, we suppose are allready well knowen to your grace. Now therefore the petition that we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to obteyne of your highnesse is this in effect. That for as much as Osorius hath vttered all his cunnyng and eloquence by all meanes he may possibly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praue vs (who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he vnhonestly reprocheth by the name of Lutheranes) not onely vnto your Maiestie, but to all other Princes of Christendome also, thereby to bryng
<pb facs="tcp:3766:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
vs into vnappeasable hatred, it may please the Royall Maiestie of all godly Princes, not to conspire to geaue sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce agaynst vs, before the matter be heard and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated betwixt vs. And your highnesse especially (most noble kyng of Portingall) hauyng allready seene the clamours and brables of Osorius, beyng the best and chiefest Arguments that he vseth to deface the orders and obseruation of our profession, will vouchsafe also with like equitie and patience of minde, to admitte our confutation thereof into your presence: whereby eche partie beyng discouered according to truth, your high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes may more certeinly determine of the cause. There is a notable Law and an othe established in the Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of the auncient Athenians: <hi>To heare with both eares, that indifferent eares should be open to eche partie.</hi> But what maner of custome is vsed now a dayes in this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexitie and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bate of opinions, where Byshops armed with the aucthoritie of Princes doe stand raunged in mayne battell agaynst the manifest veritie, and doe so bende the whole co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sent of their fayth to the one partie that all libertie once to mutter is vtterly cutte of from the other partie?</p>
            <p>But here may some contrary doubtfullnes parad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture trouble your Royall thought, not so much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedyng from your gracious nature, as whyspered into your godly eares by the subtill and slaunderous practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes of glaueryng glosers: who vnder the counterfaict vysour of this glorious cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>terfaict Church, haue won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully bewitched the eyes and eares of many noble personadges, &amp; vnder prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of succeeding course of many yeares, do make glorious bragges, that this new-fangled Church, wherein the Romish Byshopp in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thronized is the onely Catholicke Church, and the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy thereof to be onely obeyed, alleadgyng the
<pb facs="tcp:3766:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
same Church to be the Empresse and gouernesse of all other Churches, and which of right ought to be estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med aboue all Kinges &amp; Emperours, as ouer the which Christ hath substituted the Byshopp of Rome his sole Vicar and Vicegerent earth: and therfore that all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees ought and may safely submitt themselues to the aucthoritie and determination of that Churche, as which beyng continually vpholden by the power and blessing of the holy Ghost, was neuer seene hitherto to haue erred, ne yet could by any meanes swarue one title from the right lyne and knowen trade of the true fayth taught in holy Scriptures. And that all other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons whatsoeuer sequestering the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the prescript Rules and Cannons of that Churche, cann not chuse but runne headlong into wandryng errours, amazed blindenes, and extreme maddnes. Wherefore those Lutheranes and Hugonoughtes are worthely to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled from the vnitie of that Church, and deseruedly adiudged to fier and fagottes as most dampnable here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques, not worthy of any fauorable protection, no not their writinges so much as to be touched with any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s handes, bycause they dare presmou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te once to quacke agaynst the supremacy of that Angelicke Ierarchy.</p>
            <p>As touchyng which slaunderous surmises, albeit nothyng cann be more falsely and shamefully imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, then those Sorcerous enchau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tementes, it is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, how much this poysoned Dolldreanche hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>typpledd the sences of many great personadges, and hath so long preuailed in great admiration with sundry estates, through the onely ignoraunce of learnyng and ouermuch credulitie of godly Princes: vntill of late by the incomprehensible prouidence of Almightie God, the worthy Arte of Emprintyng was erected, by meanes whereof good Letters and Bookes came to the

Hereby it came to passe, that the tedious &amp; deepe doungeons of lothesome ignoraunce beyng surprised with a certein new and cleare dawnyng day of purer doctrine, as also of all other liberall Sciences beganne to shyne abroade, nor will leaue (I trust) to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spread his brighte glisteryng beames dayly more and more, vntill with the inaccessible brightenes thereof it do either thoroughly vanquishe the whole kyngdome of darkenes, or at the least chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge the same into some better countenaunce.

Emongest whom I most humbly call vpon your highnes (most singuler Paterne of Princely Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altie) not to the ende to teaze you to exercize cruelty agaynst that viperous generation. Onely my petition is (that for the loue you beare to Iesus Christ, and your owne soules health) ye vouchsafe to deliuer simple innocentes from the bloudy iawes of those rauenyng Wolues, and horrible blouddsuckers. That enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunge of thynges beyng made, the true and pure word of God may be heard what it teacheth. And that ye lett lowse the reynes of their licentious insolency no longer, so that they do not hereafter abuse you, as the Iewes did handle our Lord Iesu Christ, whose face<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> when they had blindefolded, they beate his body with whippes. There hath bene to many broyles allreády emongest vs Christians: to much Christian bloud hath bene spilte: to much crueltie and horror hath bene exequuted, whiles you in the meane space (in whose power rested the staye of this outrage) either wincked at their bootchery, or at the least, left poore innocentes succourlesse in their slaughter houses. How long shall this Romishe Nymrod vaunt in his throne? how long shall he make a scorne of your patience (most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb facs="tcp:3766:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Princes) when will your Royall hartes and noble courage daunte his pride? when will you resume into your handes the whole sword of Iustice, the better part whereof the Romishe Russian hath bereft you? when will you surcease to be bondeslaues vnto them, whom the mighty God hath made vassalles to your lawfull Regime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t? how long will ye suffer your mouthes to be mooseled, and your eyes muffeled with such blynde errours contrary to the manifest light of the Gospell? If the questions (whereof ariseth our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie) were so harde and intricate, that they excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded your capacities, I would not haue entruded my selfe into your presence with this maner of persuasion, but would haue referred my selfe rather to the censure of the learned. But for as much as this Religion of Gods holy Gospell, which we professe, is so resple<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant in the eyes and eares of all men, as the bright shy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Sunne in whott Sommers day, the doctrine (I say) wherewith we are enstructed, which preacheth Repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

If he be of opinion that errours ought to be rooted out of the Church, lett him first co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uince those for errours, which he gaynesayth, and shew him selfe abler man to make proofe by Argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to resist with onely cauillyng: By such meanes will he be deemed a more profitable member of the Church, and procure him selfe lesse ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred. It is an easie matter for euery common rascall to vomitt out disdaynefull names of infamous persons as Protagoras, Diagoras, Cicloppes, Blindsinckes, Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,

gortellguttes, and monsters. But it fitteth comlyer for learned men, and more profitable for the Christian congregation, to lay aside distompered choler, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct the vnlearned, and reclayme the obstinate with sounde Argumentes and expresse testimonies of the Scriptures. If this order be not obserued, euery carter may soone by aucthoritie clayme to be a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler. An other methode of writyng was requisite in O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorius more effectuall to edifie, then as he hath vttered in his bookes. For this sufficeth not for him to reuile men with odious names, as callyng them madd, impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, childish and infau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, and to declame whole co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>But wise men ought chiefly haue considered, how euery mans assertio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is framed to the agreablenes of the word of God. Yet now a dayes I cann not tell how, the carte is sett before the horse, and the preposterous fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnes of some persons haue brought to passe, that bycause men shall not be guided by the Gospell, they will runne before it, &amp; so mens imaginatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s shall not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey but beare the principall Banner before. But where as the right squaryer of Christian fayth hath none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sure foundation but that onely, which is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon the holy Scriptures, our dutie hadd bene to direct the buildyng of our Religion by this lyne and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, and to ramme fast the wallworkes hereof with this cemente and morter. But now I cann not tell how it is so come to passe, that many do worke guyte contrary.

For they despise this well fenced order, and hauyng as litle regarde to the meanyng &amp; purporte of the word, they rayse to them selues a Church (which they call Catholicke) and the same they assigne to be the onely guide and gouernesse: yet notwithstandyng they make no demonstration whether it be the Church of Christ yea or nay. But measuryng the same by the onely Title of the Romish See, through swiftenesse of opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, doe affirme her to be such a Church, as cann by no meanes goe astray, and whatsoeuer this Church doth denou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and commaunde, the same they doe most greedely catche after with the whole bente of their fayth, and defende it with tooth and nayle. Out of this sincke were plumped at the first mens traditions, and sundry preiudiciall opinions, as certein vnreproueable deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, they call them <hi>Vnwritten Verities</hi> which by leysure they do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ferre with the Scriptures, but in such sorte, that whatsoeuer shall seeme to serue for their purpose, they Canonize the same as inuiolable: but if ought be founde contrary to their expectation, then either they submitt it to the Iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Church, or with violent wrestyng, do racke the same to colour their suggestions.</p>
            <p>And hereof sprang all that Darnell and Cockell of errours and dissensions, bycause many men did fashion their fayth after this frameshapen chaungelyng, and not after the simple conduct of the word. In which Church when they perceaued those and such other doctrines to be embraced, as these, to witte, that the Romish See ought to be supreme Empresse ouer all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Churches: that Purgatory must be beleeued: That Pardons were necessary: that vowes made to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne vnmaried were meritorious: That Mounckery and cowled profession hadd a certein wonderfull per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:
<pb facs="tcp:3766:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
That Images ought to be worshipped: Sainctes prayed vnto: and that the Grace and deseruynges of Iesu Christ could not of it selfe suffice to the attayne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Saluation: That no man could obteyne righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes through fayth without workes. That Christ him selfe flesh, bloud, and bones was conteined and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed in the Masse vnder bare accidentes: That lay persons should be denied the vse of readyng the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, &amp; participatyng the cuppe of the Lord. All these and many other like drugges, though they neuer could finde in the liuely wellsprynges of holy Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, yet bycause they perceaue them to be shryned in the Decrees and Decretalles of Rome, they doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stauntly beleeue that they must be of as autentique au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cthoritie, as if they were so many Oracles lette<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> downe from heauen. Hereby cometh to passe, that vnder the vysour of the Churche, sondry deformed byshapes of doctrine are fostered vpp in the Church: and vnder the pretence of Christ, the true Gospell of Christ is in no small daunger to be vtterly defaced. So that the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable complaynte vttered by Chrisostome, could neuer so aptly be applyed as to this our Age: <hi>Many doe walke</hi> (sayth he) <hi>vnder the name of Christians, but very fewe in the trueth of Christ.</hi> But bycause we haue debated these matters with Osorius hereafter at large, I will not deteigne your Royall Maiestie with any further Register thereof.</p>
            <p>It remayneth, that we make humble intercession to almightie God the Father of our Lord Iesus Christ, that of his immeasurable mearcy and loue, wherewith he disdayned not to disclose him selfe vnto mankynde by his Sonne, he will vouchsafe to beautifie and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishe, and with his mighty power and outstretched arme to defende and make permanent from all errours

Lastly we pray, that he will endue all Christian Kynges and Princes beyng sett in aucthority, and especially the puissaunt and victorious Sebastian Kyng of Portingall, with all Princely orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, to enriche him with all perfect and absolute clemency, in vertue and true godlynesse, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten him with the knowledge of his glorious coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce, and establishe his throne, to the settyng forth of his glory, and aduauncement of his Church, through the merites of the same our Lord Iesus Christ: who graunt you in this world millions of his grace, and in the world to come lyfe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlastyng.</p>

            <p>A Few yeares past a certeine Portingall named <hi>Ierome Osorius</hi> wrate a tedious Epistle to the Queenes Maiestic: In the which he imagined many monstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous errours to bee frequented in our church, &amp; with reprochful rayling most vnreuerently depraued the professours of the Gospel. This publicke quarell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst my nature countrey troubled me not a litle: To some particular pointes wherof I thought good to aunswere, although not to all in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall. Partly, bycause I wated tyme thereunto, &amp; partly bycause I supposed, that <hi>Osorius</hi> was deluded by some malicious report of our aduersaries: &amp; therefore I hoped, the man would haue bene somewhat satisfied with myne aunswere.

I perused this Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie (for to be entituled that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fused llipe) I neuer saw so foolish &amp; vnsauery a writing, full ofskoffes &amp; absurdities, which two be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng taken away, there remained els nothyng besides.

Hereunto was added such store of vanitie, and proude hawtynes, that in respect of him, <hi>Thraso</hi> might be well adiudged a very discret person. I sorrow to speake so much, for it had bene more acceptable to me, and more honesty for him (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ordinary course of commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> conference) to haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated our matters frendly, and quietly, rather then to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bat to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with such tauntyng and snatchyng. But sithence <hi>Osorius</hi> disputeth not as a Byshop, neither will I argue to him as to a Byshop. Neither is it requisite, that I should be myndefull of <hi>Osorius</hi> estate, sithence he forgetteth his owne &amp; myne also. And it standeth with good reason, that if he haue take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any pleasure in euill speakyng, he loase the same in euill hearyng. Here of (gentle Reader) I thought good to premonishe the: partly, that thou mayest perceaue the, course and processe of our writyng: partly, that if I shall seeme sometymes somewhat to sharpe in myne aunswere, thou mayest impute it to the enforcement of myne ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersarie, rather then to the bitternesse of my nature. Now I will request two thynges of thee. The first is: that as I shall haue briefly and throughly confuted the most foolish and spitefull braules of <hi>Osorius,</hi> so thou wilt be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t therewith, not requiring many woordes in matters of so small substaunce. For albeit <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorius</hi> can lunite to him selfe no measure nor ende of pratlyng, yet will I so temper my talke, that I neither abuse thy leysure, nor myne owne. Not bycause it is a hard thyng, but a matter rather of no difficultie to fill whole Uolumes with scribling and toyes: But that it is odious to be accused of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> selfe same faulte, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of a man doth condemne an other. My last request is, That thou yeld thyne attentiue mynde voyde of parcialitie in opinions: which two if thou grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vnto me. It shall easely appeare (I trust) both that I haue no lesse godly, then necessarily entred into the honest defence of my countrey. And thou also as playnely perceaue, how malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously and wickedly England hath bene accused and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praued by her cursed enemy <hi>Osorius.</hi>

            <p>IN the entrey of this Tragedie, this prattling brawler hath framed a long discourse to shew,<note place="margin">Osorius beginneth with a dou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble excuse.</note> how my booke cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine yeares after the publicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of came to his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, wherein he sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to finde some mysticall matter. As though to know, when hee recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued my booke were any iote to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, whereof we doe entreate: or as though any man may doubt, whether a writyng sold in euery shoppe, might in foure yeares space be transported into Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingall. Or that myne aunswere publiquely Imprinted, could by no meanes els be brought to <hi>Osorius,</hi> vnlesse that worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Prelate of <hi>Angrence,</hi> had come ouer into Flau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders. Nay surely. For as this maketh litle to the matter to know when, or at what tyme my booke came to your sight, so is it not credible that you wanted him foure yeares after the Imprinting. And there is no doubt, but that there were messe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers enough, that would haue conueyed the same vnto you, though this Byshop of Angrence had neuer sene Bruxels, yea though he had neuer bene borne. And therefore this friuolous painted Preface of yours might haue bene spared altogether, if it had not bene ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companyed with two iolly mates. The one, that ye might vp this meanes yeld your honorable testimonie of your frende <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuell,</hi> who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you aduau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce for his excellency aboue the skyes. But you come to late <hi>Osorius</hi> for this your carrion <hi>Emanuell</hi> departyng fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Flaunders, hath left behynd him a most euident monument of his folly, bewrayng his blockyshnesse: wherein alone hee hath vttered so many proofes of his ignoraunce, and impudencie, that no man will beleue you, though you extoll his worthynes with an othe. Wherfore if you haue any delight in his felowshyp, vse the same rather in couert in your owne countrey at home: for els where <hi>Osorius</hi> shall neuer get honor or honesty by praysing <hi>Emanuell.</hi> The seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d part of your nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration declareth the laudable custome of your countrey, where bookes of corrupt Religion may not be admitted: and therfore

that Emanuell durst not commit myne aunswere vnto you, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse he had first obteined licence thereunto. What do I heare?

By what exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, with what reason, with what learnyng doe you iustifie this? For where as our writers do publikely inueighe agaynst your Ierarchy, &amp; wholy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uince your superstitions, it is enacted by your Canon Law, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son yeldeth no lesse, that the writinges of your aduersaries should bee deliuered vnto your Doctours and Pillers of the Churche pardye, that you may burne them and broyle the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours of them, if they come in your clawes. Reason doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire this, &amp; custome hath this farre forth preuailed with you. This is also established by your doctrine. And yet onely Portin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gall is so squeymish at our writynges, that <hi>Osorius</hi> beyng him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe the most couragious champion of the Romishe facultie, may not handle any leafe therof:<note place="margin">Emanuell Byshop of Angrence in Portin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitour.</note> no, nor <hi>Emanuell</hi> a Bishop of Angrence may not dare to send any title therof to his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar and felow <hi>Osorius,</hi> though otherwise <hi>Emanuell</hi> be a most pestile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t enemie of the Gospel, a visitour (as he reporteth of him selfe) and an Inquisitour of heretiques.

            <p>Your second cause you say proceéded of dutiefull charitie,<note place="margin">The second part of the excuse of Osorius.</note> that so you might depraue me for some lacke of modestie, in that to your iudgement my writinges doe represent I know not what arrogancie, so that I seeme to you in some places to ouer reache so much, as standyng still amased in myne owne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceite, I seéme to gape after my frendes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendations. This is a new kinde of charitie truely, with such viperous ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cour of wordes to charge your Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> brother of that horrible crime of arrogancie, whom you neuer saw nor knew.<note place="margin">Rom. 2.</note> S.

In this therfore <hi>Osorius</hi> being hym selfe a most vayne &amp; arrogant ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bewrayeth his owne beastly canckred stomacke, vpbraydyng hawtines to <hi>Haddo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> especially sithe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce the demeanour of <hi>Had<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> by the testimonie (I trust) of such as doe know him, doth as farre differre from all hawtines, as the poysoned Pamphlet of <hi>Osorius</hi> is voyde of all ciuilitie &amp; shamefastnesse. But what shall I say to this babler, who is so captious, that he will not admit one good word of my mouth? For hee vtterly disdayneth the prayses that I do geue hym: as where I denounce him to be artificiall in his wordes and phrases, hee thinketh I mocke him, or els that I doe so commende his vtteraunce in stile, as otherwise I doe discommend him for lacke of iudgement and knowledge.

For thus I iudged at the first, and euen the same I iudge of you still, that you are plentifully flowyng in very apt wordes, but are so drowned in them, that you haue very slender or no vnderstandyng at all in science.

Doe you not hereby name conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne all England of a certeine new Gospell? &amp; do you not accuse this Gospell to be the very forge of all wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes? <hi>I confesse</hi> (say you) <hi>that I accuse Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, but not all England.</hi> But haue you any smatch is Logicke? Who that wil prayse or disprayse London, <hi>Olyssipone,</hi> England or Portin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall by name, doth he not vnderstand all England thereby and all Portingall?

            <p>Then ensueth your lamentable complaint concernyng the death of the Bishop of Rochester.<note place="margin">Syr Thom More.</note> 
               <hi>Thomas Moore</hi> and certein Charterhouse Monckes,<note place="margin">Iohn Fisher Byshop of Rochester.</note> who were (you say) must cruelly mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, and that England hath euer sithence remained in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueilous infamie. Uerely I confesse, that <hi>Moore</hi> and <hi>Rossens.</hi> were both endued with great store of singular learning, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to seé such excellent learned men runne headlo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g into such absurde and pesfile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t errour, as to preferre a foreine and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie power before their liege and soueraigne Kyng. But when as it was enacted by the law of the land, that this crime should be deémed high Treason, it was requisite, that all such subiectes as would wilfully infringe that law, should incurre the punishment prouided in that behalfe. As for the Charter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house Monckes, the losse was the lesse, how much more they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to them selues, vnprofitable to their countrey, and could alledge nothyng in their defence but custome and contumacie.

            <p>Two points you carpe at in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ordering of our lawes: the one is, <hi>that euery man particularly may not geue his voyce,</hi> as though any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth doth admit such custome? Su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mons are made by wordes, by courtes, by hundreds, but it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer seéne that euery particular person should bee required by Poll. And therfore that sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of <hi>Liuie.</hi> The greater part pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaileth oftentymes agaynst the wiser, hath alwayes bene seéne in all auncient ages, and our predecessours also, that a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall

Doe you take together Cobblers, Tyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, Butchers, Cookes, Mullettours. &amp;c. &amp; other like dregges and outcastes of the people, &amp; enquire their seuerall opinions? or do ye reduce your infinite multitude to the choice of your wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser Citizes?

These speaches you will not acknowledge to be yours, but myne. Nay in deéde these pernitious and pestilent wordes are your owne, the whiche though I repeated in myne owne wordes, yet the whole sentence of wordes is your owne: &amp; though ye speake not the selfe same, yet ye speake that, which in effect is all one, like a peruerse Sophister. I did also disclose all your filthy rayling, in so much that no kynde of ignominie, no crime of haynous offence, no spot of beastlynesse, no sparke of impietie could almost be reckoned by, but you had therewith defiled the doctrine of the Gospell, and the professours of the same.

prerogatiue they obteined, how wyde, and how farre they stret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, with how cruell bondage they had cramped mens consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, not onely the auncient age and receaued custome of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeares most truly recordeth, but the rotten carcasses also bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in graue will beare sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t witnes against you.<note place="margin">Trust in Po<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pish pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s vayne and wicked.</note> Amongest a great number of whom, were fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de caskettes full of pardons safely folded, and lapt together in the bottome of their graues: Which I suppose would neuer haue chaunced, vnlesse vnmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surable superstitious affiaunce had bene attributed to this pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng leade<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pilfe. Now if the liuely authoritie of the holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures haue so vtterly quasshed &amp; blurred out this bald ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> at length you confesse now, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all confidence of saluation ought to bee ascribed to the onely bountie and mercy of Iesu Christ, (as your selfe protest in the selfe same wordes) Uerely I do hartely reioyce in the behalfe of Spayne. But as I haue no quarell with that famous Natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at all: so haue I very great agaynst you: whose communicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is so wonderfully variable, that a man may scarse trust you in this matter. For if it be true,<note place="margin">Osorius a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst hym selfe.</note> that our righteousnesse doth partly depend vpon good workes: agayn if it be meritorious to pray to the virgine Marie, which both you do verifie, and likewise earnestly auow that she hath bene oftentymes founde mercyfull to your petitions: of these then proceédeth a good consequente, that all the hope of our iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification ought not to be ascribed to Christ onely.</p>
            <p>But these thyngs shalbe better co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidered hereafter in place fit for them: in the meane tyme call to your remembrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce what a thyng it is to speake honorably, and largely of the incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible mercy of God, when as otherwise you make but a very slender accoumpt therof.

For that pure and vndefiled foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine of auncient Religion was long sithence dried vp, when as a certeine deformed counterfaite of outward holynesse was priuely crept into the Church, &amp; had so garnished it selfe, with

Truly if <hi>Osorius</hi> were not, as he is, he would not be so bitterly clamorous agaynst me, in that I doe so earnestly abhorre that lumpishe leaden Idoll: which hath bene most wickedly esteémed for the onely ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke and foundation of all other trecheries.

Nay rather when arose betwixt them a question, who should be greatest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest them: our Lord and Sauiour Christ did so vtterly suppresse that ambicious contention, that he briefly denounced, that he which was left, should be greatest amongest them.

But if his groundewordes be planted vpon Sande, the rest of his buildyng will quickely shiuer in peéces, and come to ruine. First of all therefore: Note this to bee commonly vsed throughout the whole Scripture: That when our Lord and Sauiour Iesu Christ would demaunde any question of all his Apostles, Peter would make au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>swere in the name of the whole generally, and not in his owne name particularely. So to that question:<note place="margin">Marg. 9.</note>

               <hi>Thou art Christ the sonne of the liuyng God.</hi> Agayne, when the Lord demaunded, <hi>Whether they his Disciples would depart away from him with the rest of the Iewes?</hi> Peter not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for him selfe, but for his whole company, denyed, saying, <hi>Lord whether shall we goe. Thou hast the wordes of eternall lyfe.</hi> The life hereof is in Peters Sermon, when he exhorted the Iewes to repose their whole affiaunce of saluation in Iesu Christ, whom they Crucified, and was risen agayne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> death to life. For in the same place it is sayd, that Peter alone did not preach to the Iewes, but with the other eleuen. The wordes were pronounced by Peters mouth onely, but the mynde, sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, &amp; ente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t was agreed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apostles.

               <hi>But you are they, which haue perseuered with me in all my temptations.

Namely sithence our Lord Iesus goyng a whiles after suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer death, and makyng preparation for his Ascention into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, poured out most earnest prayers vnto his Father, with a long and vehement repetition of wordes, not for Peter parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, but for all the rest of the Apostles in generall, whiche last and generall prayer of Christ to the Father, who so adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly considereth, shall easely conceaue, that our Lord Iesu Christ made not intercession for Peters faith alone, but for all the rest of the Apostles: And hereof will also maruell much, how great learned Clarkes dayly exercised in the Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, can Iudge therof otherwise. Truly the most notable of the auncient Fathers do constantly affirme,<note place="margin">Orig. in Math. Cap. 16.</note> that the very same sentences wherewith Supremacie is challenged vnto Peter, are commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to all the other Apostles together with Peter. And this haue I most manifestly proued by the selfe same places, which your selfe vouched. And albeit we passe ouer all these, &amp;

geue eare to the holy Ghost, speakyng vnto vs by the mouth of the sacred Scriptures, yet all this Monarchie of Peter which you do so exquisitely aduaunce aboue the Moone,<note place="margin">Augustin. de Agone Christi.</note> and the seuen Starres, shalbe founde to haue bene vsurped by the inordinate ambition of Byshops of Rome, and not by any authoritie grosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon the doctrine of the auncient Apostolicke Church.</p>
            <p>I will begyn with our Lord and Sauiour Iesu Christ, who hauyng spoken these wordes <hi>Thou art Peter &amp;c,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Math. 16.</note> immediately after calleth Peter Sathan, and commaunded him to departe from him: bycause hee knew not the thynges that apparteined vnto God. How did Christ then (I beseéch you) erect the supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie of his Church in the person of Peter, whom immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, &amp; almost with one breath, he rebuked bytterly, by that most execrable name of Sathan? and that not without cause: for hee dissuaded him from goyng to Ierusalem. Moreouer if Christ made intercession to the Father for Peter onely, that his fayth should not faynt: how came it to passe, that within a few dayes after, Peter onely with open mouth denyed, &amp; forsware Christ his Lord and Maister? But I doe much miscontentedly make mention of the fall of so notable an Apostle, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the most excellent amongest the famous Apostles. One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this I would to be knowen, that he was ordeined to no seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall supremacie in the Churche of Christ, by any authoritie of the Scriptures. We haue heard Christ: let vs come now a litle lower to his Apostles, and namely vnto Paule, who labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Churche of God (as hee reporteth of him selfe) more then they all: he therefore doth playnly and constantly affirme, that he had receaued as great authoritie from Christ, to be an Apostle ouer the Gentiles, as Peter had ouer the Iewes:<note place="margin">Gal. 2.</note> and addeth further, that he had conference with Iames, Cephas, and Iohn, whom he nameth Pillers of the Church, as the chief of all the rest. Yet in the meane whiles hee acknowledgeth no singular prerogatiue of prheminence in Peter. Nay rather he vseth great libertie of speach agaynst Peter him selfe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all respect of Principalitie, or mention of dignitie. But why seéke we other testimonies? Peter is a good witnesse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernyng him selfe.<note place="margin">Petri Epist. 1. Cap. vlt.</note> 
               <hi>I beseech the Elders, whiche are amongest you</hi> (sayth heé) <hi>that am also an Elder, and a witnesse of the Passion of

Lastly a most Reuerend Father not in any singular Lordlynes, but by especiall ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry power of his fellow brethren. Who so will throughly sift the doctrine, the ordinaunces, the lyfe, and conuersation of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,<note place="margin">Act. Cap. 1. 2.5.</note> shall finde a most perfect patterne of vnchaungeable consent, but shall not smell any tast, no not one sparke so much of this Lordly Monarchie, wherof this ghostly Prelate doth so subtlely, and largely dispute. Unlesse perhaps he will driue vs to friuolous gesses, as to picke vp children kyckesses together. As that Peter went before: That hee spake oftentymes first: that hee looked into Christes Sepulchre before Iohn. But if we shall hunte after such gnattes.<note place="margin">Act. Cap. 15.</note> The honour geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to Iames is of more substaunce. Namely when in their publicke assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, the rest of the Apostles did subscribe to the ordinaunce that he made: And that other also: to wit when Peter was desirous to know who should betray our Lord &amp; Sauiour Iesu Christ to the Iewes, him selfe did not enquire therof, but beckened to Iohn, whiche did leane vpon the breast of our Lord, that hee might demaunde the question.</p>
            <p>But howsoeuer these thynges are construed. The callyng of the Apostles was equall: one maner of function amongest them all, the authoritie indifferent: one selfe same holy Ghost poured vpon eche of them at one tyme, the promises generall, &amp; the reward proportionall. The which though I doe knit vp briefly, makyng hast foreward: yet if any man will behold eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry seuerall parcell, and withall enter into a deépe considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the most pure, and vndefiled Church of Christ, and his Apostles, as he shall perceaue an enterchau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geable communion in that strickte societie of Apostleshyp, so shall he soundly iudge of that Monarchie and superioritie in possessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, in giftes, and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:3766:33"/>
other functions, and all other priuiledges of dignitie especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: That they were vtterly renounced of Peter, and of all that sacred Brotherhood. These former positions therefore beyng now thus well fenced, your cutted Apishe Sophisme is cut of by the rumpe, wherewith you conclude so ridiculously: <hi>If it be euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t</hi> (say you) <hi>yea more apparau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t then the sunne in mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, that Peter was aboue all the other Apostles in superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of degree, then is it most manifest, that the same ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and preheminence in dignitie is due to all them that suceede him in place.</hi> O leaddagger Argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, in which what shall I blame first? If Peter (you say) were a Prince. It is all one forsooth, as if this our holy father had wynges, perhaps he would flye like a Wildgoose. But admit that Peter were pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in <hi>Pontisicalibus,</hi> as you would haue it, though it be quyte contrary, as I haue already proued. But we will graunt it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you for a tyme. What will you gayne hereby? That the same dignitie is due to the Successours? wherfore I pray you? The priuiledge of the person is not extended beyond the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:<note place="margin">The priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the person rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth no further the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the partie him selfe, vnlesse it be limited by name.</note> And therefore if the Maiestie of Peter were peculiar to Peter, euen so it ended in him selfe. But if you had no leysure to learne the Ciuill Law, can not common reason teache you, that whatsoeuer priuiledge is geuen to one person alone, may not bee translated to his successours, vnlesse it bee limited by name? But if these two crooches deceaue you, come of, and learne of our Sauiour Iesu Christ him selfe, what kinde of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority that was, wherof Christ made mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to Peter.<note place="margin">Math. 16.</note> 
               <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed art thou Symon Bariona, for fleshe and bloud haue not reuealed this vnto thee: but my father which is in heauen.

               <hi>For God doth not accept the person of any man.</hi> In like maner neither flesh nor bloud may challenge any succession in this promise, whether it be <hi>Iuly, Boniface, or any other:</hi> But the fayth and confession of Peter is the true succession of Peter.

            <p>Therfore cast away this your patched conclusion, lame, and haltyng of euery legge.

Therfore this is but a slender Argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to enduce me to reuerence your lead, except I were too too leaddish by nature. But sithence you haue shronke from your tackle, and forsaken the leaden Bulles of your Monarche in so succourlesse a shipwracke, without helme or cable in such dispayred perplexitie, you are to be esteémed not onely a leadden and woodden, but a durtie aduocate also of your Romish Monarchie: if at the least any thyng may be more fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy then durte. Yet that ye may the better proceéde, you spitte on your handes, and take hold of my wordes, which are these. But there came a thundercracke into our eares out of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly authoritie of the sacred Scriptures, that made our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences afrayde: and compelled vs to abandonne and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake all mens Traditions, and too putte our whole confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the onely freémercy of God. Well: I acknowledge this speache to be myne owne, yea and gladly also: And I finde nothyng therein blameworthy.</p>
            <p>But what sayth <hi>Osorius</hi> to this grace? <hi>Doe ye not say gramercy to Luther</hi> (sayth hee) <hi>that linked you so fast with such a singular benefite to abandonne all fearefulnes from you? What is the matter my Lord? what Planet hath distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered you</hi>? I haue nothyng here to do with <hi>Luther</hi> nor with his doctrine of fayth. I shewed that our consciences were terrified with the authoritie of sacred Scriptures, and constrained to fleé to the freé mercy of God: you say, <hi>Luther</hi> hath written er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roniously touchyng fayth: forsooth these two hang together like

a sicke mans dreame. As if a man would argue in this wise. <hi>Osorius</hi> is a most impudent rayler, <hi>Ergo,</hi> his companion of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grence is a perfect Logician. Are you not ashamed to cite whole sentences from an other writer, beyng vnable to frame any probable obiections agaynst any one of them? For as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernyng <hi>Luther</hi> albeit, I haue not vndertaken to defende him (as I haue oftentymes protected) yet this doe I suppose, that neither he, nor any other interpretour of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Scriptures ought to bee admitted vpon euery particular Assertion, but to haue relation to the whole discourse and meanyng of the Authour. If this especiall regard bee had vnto <hi>Luther</hi> (as in deéde it ought) he shalbe founde a profounde scholemaster both of fayth, and a good workes: and so farre to excell you in learnyng, that ye shall not be worthy to beare his bookes after him, howsoeuer you delight your selfe to gnaw vpon a few wordes of his, vnad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisedly throwen out in some heate of disputation.

In the same ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner therfore, we haue cast away traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of men, as our Lord and Sauiour Iesu Christ hath pronounced in the Gospell, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the person of Esay the Propet, <hi>But in vayne they worshyppe me teachyng the doctrine and traditions of men:</hi> And as our Lord Iesu a litle before rebuked the Phariseis.<note place="margin">Math. 25.</note>

And enen so we doe allow of <hi>Luther, Bucer,</hi> and of the rest, so long as they explane the mysteries of the sacred Scriptures vnto vs: wherein those famous men haue oftentymes trauai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led very co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendably, though you iangle neuer so much agaynst them.

and he saw the spirite of God, descendyng as a Doue, and standyng ouer him, and loe there came a voyce from heauen.

The Father loueth the Sonne, and hath yelded all thynges vnto his hand.</hi> This is a true saying of Iohn concernyng Christ, which beyng so in deéde, that must bee also true whiche I enterlaced. That Iesus Christ beyng contented with the testimonie of the holy Scriptures alleadged none other interpretour, besides him selfe. This is also vndoubted true at the last. That you are a very vnskilfull and blockishe Deuine, whiche professing the knowledge of God, do wauder so erroniously in the nature and power of God.</p>
            <p>If I should sift out the examples particularly, that you haue taked together for this purpose, I should finde them altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther voyde of all maner probabilitie, stuffed full with grosse er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours.

and as a sheepe before the Shearer neuer opened his mouth:</hi> what may be thought of the whole history of Iob, but a conquest of patience, and in most miserable calamitie a most ioyfull Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphe thereof? And yet this veépe Deuine is so voyde of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sense, that he vtterly deuyeth any sentence to be founde in the Scriptures touchyng patient sufferaunce of our enemyes wronges: <hi>You say that you haue passed ouer many thyngs.</hi> It had bene better for you truely, that you had passed ouer all thynges, then in all thynges, with malice and foule speakyng, so to turne the catte in the panne, that your wordes can neither finde head, nor foote to stand vpon: can explane nothyng sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude nothyng duely, proue nothyng effectually, but rau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge in rayling, brawle with bare affirmatiues, and with pratlyng past measure, pester and peruert the myndes, and eares of all men. <hi>You quarell with Paule, and demaunde where he lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that those persons should be restrained from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion and societie of Christians, which retayned Circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <hi>He did not</hi> (say you) <hi>alledge therfore the old Law to this effect.</hi> As though any man is so madde besides your selfe, that will mainteine sundry sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces to be alledged out of the old Testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, which are not conteined there? This do I say. This is my meanyng: This do I veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, that our Lord Iesus Christ did obserue this order continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in enlargyng the Gospell, to witte, to vouche testimonies out of the law and the Prophetes: and the same order was also continued by the Apostles. This to be vndoubted true not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all Deuines, and Byshops, but all mowers also, carters, children, and women do know and confesse, if they haue either them selues handled, or heard the Gospell preached by others. And yet this our graue grayheaded Prelate, in this so manifest light cauillously quarelleth as though the matter were doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and stuffeth whole leaues with toyes gayly knittyng vp the knot at the length, on this wise.</p>
            <p>What is it (sayth he) which the Apostles speake in their
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:3766:47"/>
assembly: It seemeth good to the holy Ghost and vnto vs. They do not say, It is written in the Scriptures. O rotten &amp; gyd dye brayne. How could the Apostles vouch the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in a new matter, when they made a new ordinaunce? But in all thynges that were conteined in the law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes, these wordes were alwayes vttered in the speaches of our Sauiour Iesu Christ and his Apostles. These selfe same wordes (I say) we shall finde many tymes repeated, and euery where redoubled, whiche you doe reiect maliciously, and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, <hi>It is writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> And this also: <hi>That the Scriptures might be fulfilled.</hi> Shall I annexe hereunto examples? It neédeth not (say you) The matter is euident. So is this also manifest, that you doe wickedly abuse the holy Scriptures, to peruert y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth of the Gospell. For where as you do demaunde of me a litle after: <hi>How I dare be so bold to say, that the auncient Fathers dyd adde nothyng to the gouernement of the Church, but that they founde in the Scriptures.</hi> I will like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise demaunde of you what came into your braynes, beyng an old man, a Byshop, and so reuerend a father, to burden me with wordes which I neuer spake, neuer wrate, neuer once thought vpon? If it shame you nothyng to make so open a lye, to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest viewe of all the world, how will you behaue your selfe in matters of Diuinitie, wherein the vnleattered people haue no iudgement? I affirmed that the auncient Fathers of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Church did vouch the Scriptures and the holy Ghost. I do acknowledge these wordes to be myne owne: Tosse them, &amp; tumble them, as ye list, and the more ye gnawe vpon them, the more will your teéth be on edge. For as then your Councels, whereunto you leane so much, were not hatched, neither any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretours as yet fully plumed. These two, wherof I made mention, were the onely sou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dations and pillers, namely the holy Ghost, &amp; the Scriptures: after them whole flockes of interpretours flusht in: all which I do not generally conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne. Neither had any iust cause of conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion bene betwixt vs in this matter, if you were not vnmeasurably quarellsome. For wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as I had set downe in playne wordes that our late Deuines do produce the Assertions of the Fathers in their bookes (as eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appeareth by their monumentes) what neéde you to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke
<pb facs="tcp:3766:48"/>
me to a tedious and vnnecessary an aunswere? and to plunge your selfe into questions, partly false, partly imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent? as I haue heretofore declared. But our gentle Byshop is so vnmeasurably geuen to chatteryng (wherein he deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth beyond reason) that he will willyngly permit nothyng to proceéde in order, though it be altogether contrary to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porce of the disputation.</p>
            <p>Out of this corruption of your mynde commeth to passe, <hi>That you deny, that lust, Rebellion and outrage are recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned sinnes, with vs</hi>: What say you reuerend father? do not we accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt lust, rebellion, &amp; outrage to be sinnes? For this do you affirme in these wordes. <hi>Here I aske an other questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of you if you had but one cru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me of shamefastnes, humanitie, wit, or modestie, would you with such foule slaunders dissame any kynde of people liuyng in the world? &amp; yet not so foule as foolish? for nothyng ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be imagined more foolish, then to rayle so absurdely aswell without all shew as likelyhode of truth.</hi> Pause here a whiles <hi>Osorius</hi> &amp; ponder well this your vndiscreét accusation, and henceforth write more aduisedly, except you meane to bewray your amazed madnesse to all the worlde. But how can you handle any matter discreétly, that to pike a quarell to brawle vpon, will wrangle about playne wordes, nay rather gnaw in gobettes, seély sillables and titles of wordes? For where as I wrate on this wise. You do accuse vs,<note place="margin">Aristarchus was a great quareller.</note> as though we had turned out our Nunnes and droues of Monckes to lust, and lowsnes of lyfe, and had sold their houses for money. This sentence our proper witted <hi>Aristarchus</hi> doth not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceaue: and doth beleue, that these wordes: Their houses sold for money: should bee construed, as though I did meane that the Selles of Nunnes and Monckes were sold for their owne behoofe. When as I affirmed playnly, that their houses were sold to the vse of the weale publique: whiche wordes no man could haue wrested so monstruously but this brablyng ras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call. Paraduenture this will seéme a great fault to call a By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop rascall. And I confesse no lesse in deéde. But I do not ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue with a Byshop, but with a very Beast crowned with a Myter: who oftentymes calleth me franticke, sometymes dron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, euery where wicked and lyar. Wherfore sithence he hath
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:3766:48"/>
forgotten and vtterly layd away the personage of a Byshop, he may not gape for any softer speach from me. But if he chaunce to call him selfe home hereafter, and gather agayne some gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie and modestie agreable to his profession, it shalbe very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sle for me to returne to mildnesse and fayre speach, which I doe commonly vse with myne acquaintaunce, and with straungers also, vnlesse they bragge in brawlyng, prau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce proudly as Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in ostentation of learnyng, and pietie, disdaynefully despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing all other mens iudgementes in respect of them selues. <hi>It displeaseth this our Gentleman also, that my stile is so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed agaynst those stinckyng sinckeholes of that cowled generatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> I spake of ours which I might more easily accuse, then you can defend: for I knew them better you did, my Lord. So had they bene lesse knowen vnto me, if by the espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall prouidence of God I had not happely escaped out of these filthy mischieuous dennes betymes.</p>
            <p>You reserue a place for the defence of your Monckes by it selfe and in drawyng their petigreé, you play the Philosopher at large.

<pb facs="tcp:3766:49"/>
if there be but one body of Christians: nor a distinct pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, bycause the spirite is one, and the selfe same: Will you haue this made more manifest by sillables and titles?<note place="margin">Ephes. 4.</note>

And you contrary to this doctrine do deuide the Christians congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, or rather disseuer it into partes, &amp; practize to plante in place thereof a frame shapen meane of pietie, whiche neither old, nor new Testament doth acknowledge. You haue heard out of the old law, we will now come to the new. There is also an expresse commaundement of our Lord Iesu Christ to his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles in these wordes. <hi>Preach ye the Gospell to all creatures,</hi>

But I tary to long vpon matters clearer then the Sunne: And yet this our deépe Deuine doth vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proppe his lazie Monckerie vpon these pillers, whiche beyng wormeaten &amp; rotten (as I haue shewed already) will at length bryng all his other buildyng to ruine, and cause it to shieuer in peéces to the grounde.</p>

But Paules meanyng is conceaued sufficiently in these few sentences. And yet to confesse the truth, this your disputation of single lyfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayleth not properly to mainteine your Monckerie, for vnma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried life extendeth it selfe to all estates of Christians general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and is not restrained to Monckes onely. But you oppresse vs with exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples partly auncient, as of <hi>Basile, Paule, Ierome Nazianzene.</hi> Partly of these later yeares, as <hi>Dominicke, Bruno, Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cisce.</hi> Here I might take lawfull exception to your testimonies if I would: for <hi>Frauncisce</hi> was no Moncke, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that also vnlearned altogether, a forger of friuolous su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitions, as appeareth by those durtie dregges, whiche you call Golden Legendes.<note place="margin">Legenda Aurea.</note> And who that <hi>Bruno</hi> was must be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired amongest the Friers, for els where is no me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion made of him, neither yet of <hi>Dominicke.</hi> The residue of the Fathers except <hi>Gregory,</hi> professed a solitarie lyfe: but enduced hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,

partly through desire of learnyng, partly for vprightnesse of lyfe, yelded more commoditie to the Christian profession, then may easily be expressed: whose dayly conuersatiou &amp; rules of maners did as farre differre from the rules of our Mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ckes, as the heauens are distant from the earth, and good from euill. But let vs graunt all that you will, and admit those Monckes (whom you speake of) to bee godly and commendable persons (for in deéde some were such) may they therfore be compared in equabilitie of estimatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to those men, who were conuersaunt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest the fellowshyp and common societte of men? will you know whom I will name? I will first of all name Iesus Christ our Lord and Sauiour: then some that were before him: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Isaac, Iacob, the Patriarches, Esay, Ieremie, notable Prophetes: next after the commyng of Christ, the glorious co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apostles: All these almost (except Christ alone) were maryed, and euery of them adioyned them selues to the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> societie of men, that they might profite the generall felowshyp of mankynd. What say you <hi>M. Ierome</hi>? May your Monckes, though neuer so commendable, be compared to this felowshyp of so excellent and famous personages? May any equabilitie seéme to bee betwixt them? either in the excellencie of the holy Ghost? or in sinceritie of lyfe? or in antiquitie of tyme? There can be no comparison betwixt them my Lord, neither was any neéde at all to rehearse these examples, if you had well ordered your talke herein: for this generall company beyng the floure of the auncient primitiue Church, standyng in the face of your drowsie lozelles, will so dazell their sight, that they shall not be able to lift vp their eyelyddes for the inaccessible brightnesse of them.</p>
            <p>And yet do not I condemne vnmaried lyfe, or that kynde of sole lyfe. I condemne your false and wicked argument, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you would persuade the vnmaried Christian to be better and more holy then the maried, and the solitarie, better then the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen.

turmoyled your selfe in this gulfe, sometymes treatyng of Pictures, sometymes inducyng them as representations of holy personages: you packe vp your trunckes, and returne to your former course of exhortation, wherein you persuade that bycause Images be sauory Instrumentes to enforme the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lettered people, therefore they ought bee reserued to that vse. But learned and godly men will rather say, that Images are daungerous Rockes of manifest Idolatry. And as I will not much gaynesay, that discréete men and well exercized in the Scriptures may haue in their Closettes without any perill, the Image of the Crucifixe, so doe I boldly pronounce that without great daunger of Idolatry, Images can not be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in Churches, to the uiewe of the rude people beyng natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally incliuable to all superstition. And therefore it is most ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to abandone Images out of Churches, and to instruct the people in the holy Scriptures, the often hearyng and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng wherof, will make the diligent and uertuous followers, to finde no want of any such paynted bables: Sathan cary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Lord and Sauiour Iesus into the wildernesse willed him to fall downe and worshyp him.

            <p>But runne on, sith it so pleaseth you, and scorche your soules in the flames of Idolatry: we beyng terrified with the Deuine Oracles of the sacred Scriptures, haue vtterly subuerted I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages and Pictures, and exiled them from our Churches. In like maner we passe ouer the Saintes in our prayers, &amp; make intercession onely vnto God the Father and our Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Iesu Christ, and vpon them do we call onely for succour.

And to confirme this our confession to bee most pure and true, the testimonies of eche Testament are plentyfull: wherein we doe also follow the manifold examples of the Patriarches, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles and Martyrs.

For first of all, who euer called Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes, by this name Images, but you alone? in déede they are named signes, and markes of holy thynges, many tymes seales of our saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, many me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> call them tables: and so diuers men geue diuers names.

I trust you will permit me the same libertie of wordes, which you vse to take to your selfe.

Whereby it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that our Deuines do not accoumpt the Sacramentes as bare naked signes, but for thynges most effectuall, most holy, &amp; thynges most necessaryly apperteyning to our comfort: they be sacred mysteries of our Religion, they be assured pledges of heauenly grace:<note place="margin">Exod. 32.</note> And yet God y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father which made vs of clay is not tyed to his workema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>shyp, nor bounde to his creatures,<note place="margin">Rom. 9.</note>

substaunces, quantities, and qualities, and to helpe your iug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyng, you borow a point of Paule, cleane contrary the cause: <hi>videl.

There would not then be such a swarme of ceremonies, and superstitions in your Church, there would not bee such gaddyng on pilgrima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and lyeng grouelyng before Images, neither should we seé the Uicare of God enstalled a Lord ouer mens consciences, vtteryng his pardons of sinnes for a fewe pence, tossing and turmoyling the poore and wretched soules in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> flames of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, not enhaunsing market of the holy Scriptures, after hiw owne pleasure. Lastly your Confessours and cowled gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Uipers would not esteéme the worthynes of workes as a portion of our Iustification. Yea if you had beleued Paul, you would neuer haue admitted those poysoned monsters of Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but would haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fessed with vs: That all thyngs are geuen vnto vs together with our Lord Iesus. But I pray you what doth that sentence of Paule auayle to the Exposition of the Sacrament of the Supper of the Lord? Truely nothyng at all: yet this our goodly graue father turmoyleth all thyngs, confoundeth all thynges, not regardyng what may be agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the cause, but poureth out all thynges at happe hassard as they come into his vagaraunt quill.</p>
            <p>Now followeth a decreé of your owne sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pe in these wordes. <hi>I am of this opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that those perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s which do professe the true fayth, should co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider nothyng els herein, but how that thyng, that is decreed vpon to bee beleued, may be agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the goodnes of God. That no man might doubt by any meanes the mysterie of our Redemption.</hi> What speake you <hi>(Osorius)</hi> shall we iudge how agreable any thyng may be to the goodnes of God? Who hath made vs iudges of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of God, that we should determine what may bee agreable, and not agreable to the same? but your toung doth folter: for you would haue sayd, the will of God, or ye should haue so sayd: as farre forth as we can vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, it as farre forth as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarches,<note place="margin">Hebr. 1.</note> Prophetes our Lord Iesus also &amp; his Apostles hath

reuealed vnto vs by the sacred Scriptures. And if your decreé tende to this effect, we will accept thereof. For we make no doubt of the power of God (although you falsely reproche vs herein) but do grope after his deuine will in his word, and do humbly apply all our actions thereunto, as farre forth as the imbecillitie of our frayle and weake nature will permit. And therefore teache you I pray you, what thyng God would haue to bee made in that Sacrament, we will neuer enquire whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God be able to performe it: sor whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we are made assured of Gods good will, we will acknowledge with all reuerence and humblenesse his power, as meéte is: Next after your foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish and childish Preface ensueth a very graéuous accusation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> a meéte hotchepot for your Confessours, Schooleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; Friers.

In this question I turne you ouer to the Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tistes, whose speaches are these: A bare signe, bare bread, and bare remembraunce: which their nakednes of speach I do ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre and condemne as well as you.

The auncient Fathers could neuer discerne so cloudy a forgerie: at the last Sathan opened the eyes of your Schoolemen, &amp; made them so sharpe sighted, that in Distinctions, eccyties and quid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, they could many time easely seé that thing which was no where at all.

Lastly what is it, that your vnderstandyng doth feele and know?</hi> I will tell you, my good father, and without any cholor, I promise you, if you will heare me patiently. First I do seé that you doe childishly wander in this bitter talke, that demaunde one and the selfe same thyng in threé seuerall distinct questions.

Forsooth you are addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted wholy to your Schooletriflers, and Confessours, but very litle to the Scriptures: by meanes wherof it is come to passe, that ye skyppe ouer the open Oracles of truth, and are entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled in the weuett of errour: peraduenture also ye are become an appre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tice to the Romish Seé, and ye meane to procure with the prety Marchau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dize of your pedlers pilfe, some Cardinals Hatte. It may likewise be, that for countenaunce sake ye will face out your false packe with a carde often, bycause ye thinke it will empaire the credite of your gray heares to be ouersene in any thyng. Besides all these, custome perhappes of many yeares had made your iudgement rotten before it was ripe, as men vse to say of common lyers, which redouble a lye so often, that by their often rehearsall beleue it to be true at the length: euen so may you thinke to establishe the countenaunce of your imagined Transubstantiation by alledgyng in defence therof, a continuall allowaunce of long tyme. If none of all these haue moued you: I thinke surely ouermuch pride hath blinded you, wherewith ye swell in such sort, that you dare boldly without blushyng make vaunt of your selfe, more like vnto a bragging <hi>Thraso,</hi> or if any thing ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be more vayne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>You come at the length to our Church, the orders whereof you do captiously snatch at, but this ye do so disorderly &amp; sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me ringly, that all men may iudge that ye did roaue at it in your dreame rather then dispute beyng awake. I affirmed, that fayth came by hearyng. What say you? is it no so? I sayd also, that our Preachers are sent abroad into all the coastes of our Realme, to teach the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon people their duties in all thynges: what? will you deny this to be done? You can not: the matter is manifest. <hi>But you exclaime, and say that our Preachers are Lutherans, Bucerans, and Caluinistes.</hi> First of all, how know you this to be true? then, if it be so, let the names goe: confute their doctrine, if you can: But this lesson you learned of your Cowled Coockowes, to braule alwayes with bare names, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not ouerthrow a sillable of their doctrine.

What may be done more orderly or more circumspectly? This custome was obserued in the tyme of the kynges of Israell: This vsage preuayled in all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seils, vntill that Romishe Ierarche had burst in sunder these lawes, with his false ambitious picklockes, and had commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Out of these tempests and whirlewindes of vpstart doctrines, out of this immoderate gulfe of your idle braynes, so manifold routes of fayned Gods peéped abroad, so many sundry sortes of prayers, made vnto them, so many and so tedious pilgrima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, to dumme blockes, so many impieties of offrynges, inuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, massinges, adorations: Finally so many blasphemous markets, and fayres of pardons, and redeémyng of soules out of Purgatory pickpurse are made.

I added also a litle after that we might lacke this Papane Monarchie well enough, yea that we ought to be without it, aswell bycause the Gospell interditeth it, as also bycause reason reclaimeth agaynst it (At which wordes, the Gospel enterdityng) Our Syr <hi>Ierome</hi> sets vp his bristles &amp; although he know my meaning, yet mooseleth at the wordes, &amp; accuseth me that I can not expresse myne own meanyng sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly, what say you <hi>Osorius.</hi> Are ye so sodenly fallen an old Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour of Diuinitie to a punie Scholer and carper of wordes, are ye so sodenly disgraded from a Reuerend Prelate and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a malitious and hungry fawconer of titles &amp; sillables?

And therefore after that you had packt together a tedious Epistle to the Queénes Maiestie full of reproches &amp; slaunders, and had in the same vttered all your cankred malice, agaynst the professours of true Religion, yet all the whiles had vsed thereunto neither proofe nor probabilitie, it sufficed for me to haue confuted that pestilent inuectiue, fortified with bare affirmatiues onely, euen by the contrary therof, to witte bare negatiues. But now for asmuch as you haue stopt vp a fewe shardes in these your last tedious Commentaries, though very hardly and quyte from the purpose, yet as well as you could: I thought good to reply likewise with some Argumentes, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to ouertake you at euery loupe hoale.

            <p>I affirmed that an Italian Monarche could not aptly be a ruler ouer vs, and I alledged the cause in these wordes.

               <hi>ye doe not speake true Latine but vse a monstruous kynde of Latine phrase.</hi> Listen hereunto agayne prattlyng Sophister. I doe not affirme, that any thyng doth conueniently disagreé, as you doe maliciously i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine: but I do playnly deny, that the head ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> conueniently be distaunt fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the members. But you beyng ignoraunt what difference is betwixt an affirmatiue, &amp; a negatiue proposition, must be turned downe agayne behinde the Schoolehouse doore, amongest the apsie boyes, to learne this lesson agayne. And bycause you are so grosse of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceauyng, that ye ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not perceaue a thyng spoken briefly, and aptly, I will rehearse my wordes agayne, and will apply hereunto other phrases of the lyke ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. That all men may know, what a childishe and blockehea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded aduersary I haue. This is it therefore. For the head can not conueniently bee distaunt from the members so farre of. That is to say, it is not conuenient that the head should bee so farre asunder from the members, A frend doth not conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently disagreé from his frend: nor the Scholer from his Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, nor the Seruaunt from his Lord, ne yet the wife from the husband: That is to say it is not conuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that the frend from his frend, the Scholer from his Maister, the Seruaunt from his Lord, or the wife should disagreé from her husband. What say you <hi>Osorius,</hi> is any of these not spoken after the Latine phrase? are they not vttered playnly? and properly? doe ye not in all these conceaue the negatiue and not the affirmatiue? Are you not ashamed? doe ye blush nothyng at all at this manifest fault and marke of your follie? I haue a boye of sixten yeares age, whom I keépe to Grammar Schoole, who shoulde haue felt the smarte hereof, if hee had made so foule an escape in these Grammer principles. Truely I am wery long sithence (gentle Reader) to bee so childishly occupyed in siftyng out the titles and sillables of wordes after this maner, but you may
<pb facs="tcp:3766:85"/>
note the amazednesse and ouerthwartenes of myne aduersary, to whom the fault must be imputed accordyng to reason, which beyng both bussardly blynd in ponderyng bare wordes, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so fondly franticke, and senselesse in the substaunce of thynges, doth altogether deny any difference to be in this: how farre so euer a sunder the head bee separated from the members so that they be vnited in one fayth. Surely experience hath not onely taught vs here in England, but the practize of all other natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s also doth playnly bewray his singular ignorau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and blockish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, what it is to be seuered from Italy, by farre distaunce of regions when as in matters of Religion iustice &amp; equitie could not bee ministred, but it must bee procured with immesurable charges, and tedious pursuite of many yeares. From whiche inconuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces we have good remedy prouided through the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall goodnesse of God. For we haue in our owne Realme both Iudges and Consistories.</p>

               <hi>Ye maruell much, why I am so hatefully bent agaynst the Byshop of Rome &amp; why I doe alwayes inueighe at him.</hi> Truely I doe not hate the Byshop of Rome, for hee neuer did me any iniurie personally: it is his extraordinarie superioritie, that I write agaynst. Bycause in my opinion it is a manifest rebell agaynst the holy Scriptures, agaynst saluation and the whole state of Christianitie: Neither doe I reproue their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, especially those, whiche were established in that first and purer age of the Churche: ne yet those later Canons such I meane, as doe concerne Iudiciall Courtes. Which teach good and commendable preceptes and rules for the administration of Iustice. But I do vtterly detest and as much as in me lyeth abhorre those ambitious, and flatteryng constitutions, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilent
<pb facs="tcp:3766:91"/>
dispensations, and such like infinite filthy absurdities, erected for the procurement of dignities, or for pillyng and pollyng of coyne. I will alledge two holy constitutions for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample sake. Wherof the one is described in these wordes:<note place="margin">Distinct. 22. Cap. Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</note> The Lord hath committed the charge of all earthly &amp; heauenly Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, vnto Peter beyng appointed porter of eternall life. What Christian hart can willingly suffer such Sathanicall arrogan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie to be yelded vnto a mortall creature? And yet I will shewe one other of the same stampe farre more horrible.<note place="margin">Decrees ful of blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie.</note> The Pope hath an heauenly will, and in those thinges that his will is bent vnto, his will must bee taken for law, neither can any man say the contrary why he should not doe so: For he may dispence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all law, and make that to bee right, that is quyte co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary, in amendyng and alteryng of lawes: bycause the fulnesse of all power resteth in him. These be those golden Decreés for sooth, wherewith our Syr <hi>Ierome</hi> would haue vs yoked. This is that notable Iurisdiction of that Papane Seé, for the whiche our <hi>Osorius</hi> waxeth so whotte: <hi>That (though I burst in son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) yet ought all Christian Nations be subiect vnto it (as he affirmeth.)</hi> But I on the contrary part do iustifie, that this Papane supremacie is no more mentioned in the Scriptures then a meare strau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger,<note place="margin">The Popes power.</note> &amp; so altogether vnknowen vnto Peter, vnto Paule, and the rest of the Apostles, and to the succeédyng course of the primitiue and purer Churches, that there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer one worde spoken of it, vntill the reigne of the Tyraunt <hi>Phocas,</hi> at what tyme was the very first hatchyng of it. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes in deéde by litle and litle through pride, pillage, &amp; pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng flatteryng, it enhaunced it selfe so farre aboue measure, that it claymeth now Iurisdiction ouer Heauen, Earth, and Seas, as I haue declared somwhat before, &amp; doth more ple<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully appeare by other blasphemous Decretalles, published by the very mouthes of these holy Popes them selues. Wherfore this extraordinarie Iurisdiction of the Pope, is a most friuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, paynted, disguised, and deformed frameshapen chaunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng, though <hi>Osorius</hi> would hange him selfe therefore. And kingly authoritie shall beare chief preheminence vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the earth, accordyng to the sundry and euerlastyng testimonies both of the old and new Testament, vnto the whiche Peter and Paule
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:3766:91"/>

You affirmed in your Epistle: that through the abolishyng of your Canons, all feare, and care was vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rooted out of our hartes. I made aunswere, that many men were wonderfully enriched by your Canons: but very fewe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to haue any especiall regarde to feare God by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of them. But you trustyng to discredite myne aunswere, demaunde a question of me, <hi>Whether the Ciuill Law doe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct men in the feare of God? whiche albeit they doe not</hi> (say you) <hi>yet the monumentes therof ought not be consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with fire.</hi> What is the matter <hi>Osorius</hi>? How hanges this together? The question was moued of Canon Lawes, <hi>and you on eche parte vbrayde agaynst vs the Ciuill Law.</hi> Our communication was concernyng the feare of God, <hi>You deny that the Ciuill Lawes ought to be burnt.</hi> Are ye starcke dronke? or doe ye bable this out in a dreame? Are ye not asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of this monstruous talke? truely it is very irkesome to me, and I am throughly tyred out with so blockish an aduersary.</p>
            <p>I affirmed that the authoritie of the Canon Lawes dyd so farre forth preuayle with vs, as they were founde agreable to godlynes: and that Iustice was ministred by the Decreés ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in our Ecclesiasticall Courtes. <hi>You maruaile how this ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be true for so much as Luther had already burnte them all.</hi> First of all I demaunde this question of you. Why do ye mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile at that thyng now, which earste ye did so constauntly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny? why did you so w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out all shame dissemble in matters so eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent? Wherewithall neither all Portingall nor your Maister<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shyp could, but bee acquainted, consideryng the dayly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course and continuall traffique betwixt vs. Agayne what mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth you to name <hi>Luther</hi> herein? Uerely we for our partes haue the name of <hi>Luther</hi> in such great admiration, that we do firme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:3766:92"/>
beleue that you might likewise haue easely bene his Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler in Diuinitie. All which notwithstandyng, we name not our selues <hi>Lutheranes,</hi> but Christians: neither doe we iudge any man so absolutely perfect amongest the whole ofspryng of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam: whose wordes and deédes we may accoumpt without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception vnreproueable. Furthermore I founde fault with you, bycause you accused our Preachers, as though they taught in their publicke Sermons, vnpunishable libertie in sinning: and herein I likened your saucie malapertenes, to litle better then to blasphemie, because with so horrible reproche you did infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously slaunder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctrine of the Gospell, preached by our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines: whiche sentence after your wonted guise you turne in and out, and peruert the same from thyngs to persons: and say that <hi>I doe ascribe Deuine Godhead to Luther, Bucer, and Martyr.</hi> O monstruous vermine: did I euer speake or thinke any such matter? I did esteéme them in deéde, when they lyued as famous &amp; worthy personages, in respect of their learnyng and godlynesse, in like maner now they are dead, I will defend the remembraunce of their names as much as I may, namely <hi>Bucer,</hi>

               <note place="margin">Peter Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr.</note> with whom I was familiarly acquainted: and did know them, to be auncient godly Fathers exquisite in all vertue &amp; learnyng, and so much more furmountyng you in Diuinitie, as you do excell that your drawlatche derlyng <hi>Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mada</hi> in your deintie delicacie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Latin tou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g.

            <p>Wherefore so long as we enioyed the lyfe of this excellent learned man, and him selfe endured amongest vs, as the Churche of Christ had a very worthy and valiaunt Captaine: So had <hi>Osorius</hi> also a couragious and puissaunt an enconte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, and meéte conquerour for such a monster.

               <hi>Martin Luther</hi> (sayth he) <hi>doth teach extreme Desperation.</hi> I would fayne know where, or from whence you haue pyked out this? <hi>Luther</hi> preached many Sermons: Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led many bookes: some published in his owne cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>guage: Many also turned into the Latine toung: The readyng &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>using of the which hath recouered many persons (I doubt not) standyng vpon the very brincke of Desperation, &amp; in greéuous anguish of mynde: amongest whom I do with an vnfained, sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and humble conscience thankefully acknowledge before God, my selfe to bee one.

If God had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, that our Saluation should haue bene purchased through godly actions, and vertuous endeuour of mans life: it were not altogether without reason that <hi>Osorius</hi> doth speake. But for as much as our hope and confidence is limited within the boundes of the fayth of Christ, and the foundation thereof builded vpon this Rocke onely, I suppose surely, that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son which doth allure vs home vnto Christ, from confidence of workes, and teacheth vs to repose our whole trust in him, as in the onely Sanctuary, and shoteanker of our Saluation, doth declare rather the true way to assured hope, then abolishe the same: Neither doth he by and by, rende in sunder the sinewes of mans endeuour, who doth but embace and disable that part from ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s power, which doth properly apperteine to the sonne of God: I thinke that he discouereth rather the well sprynges of the comfortable glad tydynges of the Gospell.

Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sideryng therfore the matter is in this plight: It remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth now (gentle Reader) that I appeale to thy Iudgement, and abyde thy verdite herein: whether it may seéme to theé that <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> haue wrested the mynde and wordes of the Apostle after his lust, or <hi>Osorius</hi> rather haue peruerted the same to his owne folly. But goe to: I thinke good now to note the Argumentes wherewith <hi>Osorius</hi> iudgeth him selfe to be strongly fenced.</p>
            <q>If Paule <hi>(sayth he)</hi> had sayd,<note place="margin">Pag. 143.</note> that the Iewes were comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable for their integritie and innocencie of lyfe, and yet that those deedes of godlynes did nothyng auayle them to attayne righteousnesse, and so had concluded after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes, that they were not iustified through the workes of the law, the matter would then haue opened it selfe,
<pb facs="tcp:3766:109"/>
that by the name of workes, he did meane the best acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and dueties of vertue.</q>
            <p>Here is a strong foundation enough (I suppose) of an infallible Sillogisme deliuered vnto you, attende now the other propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of the same.</p>
            <q>But this <hi>(sayth hee)</hi> is not founde in that whole discourse of Paule, nay rather hee doth condemne them as guiltie of all wickednesse and crueltie.</q>
            <p>This groundworke beyng this layd, it remayneth that we ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me fast this buildyng vp with some good morter, which in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of a conclusion, is applyed in this wise.</p>
            <q>Therfore Paule doth rightly conclude, that where he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth no man to be iustified through the deedes of the law, he meaneth, that the Ceremonies, shadowes, and Cleansinges of the law, which consisted in outward ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation, dyd nothyng at all profite to the attayneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Righteousnesse.</q>
            <p>O passing pearcyng witte of <hi>Chrysippus.</hi> O miserable <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> vtterly ouerthrowen with this Argument. But goe to, let vs ayde <hi>Luther</hi> somewhat, and helpe to vnloose this <hi>Gordian</hi> knotte if it bee possible. And although we may vtterly deny the forme of this Argument at the first choppe, bycause it contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth more in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clusion, then was spoken of in the premisses: yet either pardonyng, or wynking at this escape: Let vs exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the substaunce of the first proposition. <hi>If Paule</hi> (quoth he) <hi>had perceaued the life of the Iewes to haue bene vndefiled, and all the endeuoures and workes of their lyfe sincere and perfect: and then had concluded that no man had bene Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified by the workes of the law. &amp;c.</hi> In deéde (good Syr) I confesse the same to bee true. If the Apostle had perceaued this at the first, and then had added that also that you speake, it might happely then in some respect haue followed as you haue conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded. But it could not bee possible <hi>Osorius,</hi> that the Apostle would euer speake after that sorte.

vnto the vttermost title thereof: it can not bee doubted but that Paule would neuer haue denyed that those should be iustified by the workes of the law, who do lead a perfect and vpright life. Yea rather he would haue affirmed this that he spake there, which is most true:<note place="margin">Rom. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Glory, honour, and peace bee vnto euery one that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth righteousnesse, to the Iewes aswell as to the Gentiles. &amp;c.</hi> But now when as he foresaw, that the Iewes did swell with a certeine Pharisaicall opinion of their workes, and proudly vaunted them selues vpon them, disdaynefully detestyng all other as Heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish, vngodly, in respect of them selues, neither seémed to stand in any neéde of the Mediatour: Therfore to the end he might shake away from them that pestilent persuasion of their owne righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, and force them to seéke succour at Christ: hereupon he did vtterly dispoyle all workes of abilitie to Iustifie: that is to say, he so taketh away all Affiance of our workes beyng of all partes vnperfect, bycause hee may ascribe it wholy to fayth onely, and repose the same in Christ alone.</p>

               </gap>e speach. First of all we must remember that the obseruation of the law hath a double vnderstandyng:<note place="margin">A double obseruation of the law.</note> for after one sorte Christ dyd obserue the law of his Father: but mortall men obserue it after an other sort: Christ most perfectly and absolutely: but we weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and rawly, yea I know not if we performe any portion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of very meanely. Whereupon ariseth a double consideration of righteousnesse: the one perfect, and is peculiar to Christ, and is onely of valew with God: the other vnperfect, &amp; lame which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly apperteineth to man, and perhappes carryeth some resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blaunce of holynesse in the opinion of men, but is of no estimation before God, nor sufficeth to Saluation. Moreouer to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chasing of that first and sincere righteousnesse, man must bee fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with two principall Tallentes: the one, that hee so accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish the whole law, that no part thereof be defectiue: The other, that hee so throughly performe euery part thereof, that nothyng may be added to absolute perfection. Or els hee may heare what the Scripture threateneth.<note place="margin">Deut. 27.</note> 
               <hi>Cursed be he that persisteth not in all the wordes of the law to doe them. &amp;c.</hi>

               <note place="margin">Iames. 2.</note> Now for as much as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer any man was able to bryng that thyng to passe but Christ onely, it is out of all controuersie, that all other mortall men, as well Iewes, as Gentiles, are fast holden vnder the curse: Whereupon the Apostle, after long debatyng of the matter, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth: <hi>That no man can bee Iustified by the workes of the law.</hi> Which sentence is not yet so to be taken, as though no deédes of the law beyng sincerely, and, perfectly done, accordyng to the prescript rule of lawe, could profite any thyng at all towardes Saluation, for the very same was performed in the person of Christ, whose life being of all partes, freé altogether, from all ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish of Sinne, could not be attaynted with that saying of Paule, <hi>That no man could bee Iustified by the workes of the law,</hi> for that he was iustified through his owne workes, especially. With as good right also, might we mainteine our lyke challenge therein, if our infirmitie were able to rayse it selfe, to that perfection of Christ. Whereupon we heare the Apostle very aptly arguyng in this wise.<note place="margin">Galat. 3.</note> 
               <hi>If that law</hi> (sayth he) <hi>had bene deliuered, that could haue geuen life, then no doubt righteousnesse had come by the law.</hi> Gallat. 3. But wherefore is it sayd that the law can not geue life?<note place="margin">Wherefore the law iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifieth not.</note> Not bycause the law wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted her efficacie to geue life, but by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we were destitute of sufficient power to accomplish the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the law. For otherwise what can bee of more force to righteousnesse, then the law? or what more effectuall to eternall life, then righteousnesse? if at the least the same were perfect, or that our nature were capable of that righteousnesse absolutely. But now beyng enuironed with so great weakenesse of the fleshe, and of all sides beset with Sinnes, yea and sold vnder Sinne, when all our endeuour is yet so vnperfect, that we neither per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the whole law, neither comprehend any small portion ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of with duetyfull and exact righteousnesse. Therfore that saying of the Apostle may rightely be applied vnto vs, wherein hee affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth <hi>That no man is Iustified by the workes of the law.</hi>

First, besides that it doth manifestly appeare, by the whole discourse, and phrase of that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:3766:110"/>
it selfe, that Paule treated there, of none other law, then the morall law, it is to be approued chiefly in these wordes, where the Apostle doth not onely testifie him selfe, of what law he made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in that place, but also of what part of the law: he doth reason in this wise, of the selfe same law. <hi>For that whiche the law could not bryng to passe, euen in that part, wherein it was weake by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the infirmitie of the flesh. &amp;c.</hi> But this part surely consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted not in the Ceremoniall law, but in the Morall law of the ten Tables: whereupon we doe argue agaynst <hi>Osorius</hi> in this wise:
<q>
                  <p>No man is bereft of righteousnesse, but in that part onely, wherein offence is committed.</p>
                  <p>But the Iewes offended nothyng in the Ceremoniall law, onely they sinned in the Morall law.</p>
                  <p>It is manifest therfore, that Paule spake not there of the Ceremoniall law, but of the law of the tenne Tables.</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Moreouer whereas Paule did discourse of that <hi>Law whiche procureth wrath.</hi> Rom. 4.<note place="margin">Rom. 4. 5.2. 3.7.9.13.</note>

These and many other places if you haue not perused in Paules Epistles I desire you to vouchsafe to read them. If you haue read them, then I beseéch you to aunswere me, whether to your Iudgement these sayinges seéme to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the Ceremoniall law, or that part of the law especially, which consisteth in the actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and dueties of maners, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon conuersation of lyfe?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But you say that the Iewes dyd put ouer much confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in their Ceremonies</hi>:<note place="margin">The righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse of the Iewes.</note> 
               <hi>And therefore to driue away the confidence whiche they reposed in them, the Apostles meanyng was to aduertize them, that they should ascribe true righteousnes to those outward Ceremonies shadowes and cleansinges.</hi> What a iest is this? as though the Iewes did settle their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidence in the Ceremonies onely? and did not

much more rather glory in their Race? in their Parentage? in their worshippyng and callyng vpon God? in their Prophetes? in Gods promises? in the deédes and workes of holynes? Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore whereas this Epistle was not written to the Iewes, but to the Romaines, what aunswere will <hi>Osorius</hi> make here? Were the Romaines also instructed to the obseruation of those Ceremonies? or did they rest so much vpon them, that it behoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the Apostle of necessitie, to forewarne them in his letters written vnto them?

But <hi>Osorius</hi> doth not seé the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de of Paules accusation agaynst them. First of all the Apostle did very well forseé, that the law of God is of all partes most perfect, and that it requireth an exquisite, full and absolute obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to the same: which (as he conceaued) could not possibly be performed by any industry of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Neither was he ignoraunt of the vnmeasurable and arrogaunt pride of that Nation lynked with lyke vanitie: which beyng by a wonderfull farre way distant from the meane obseruation of the law, did yet swell, and were puft vp with a most false glaueryng conceite of their owne excellency and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, as though they had left no part therof vndone, persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues saluation thereby, wherein they had much rather deserued vtter destruction. And so did incurre double of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. First, bycause they did sundry wayes horribly dishonour and defile Gods most sacred law: Then, as though it were not materiall that they had not perfitely accomplished the whole
<pb facs="tcp:3766:113"/>
law: a man might iustly marueile, how wonderfully they flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered them selues, and as though they had trimmely behaued them selues at all assayes, seemed in their owne conceite to bee prety holy men, despising with a certeine Pharisaicall hautines all other Nations besides them selues. Wherfore the Apostle indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly tenderyng the miserable errour of eche Nation as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well Gentiles as Iewes, doth earnestly debate threé thynges chiefly in that place.<note place="margin">The scope of Paules disputation to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines.</note> First, that he might conuince the Iewes, as also the Gentiles indifferently, that they were sinners be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God.

And in this last purpose of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, <hi>Osorius</hi> doth openly bewray his blockishe ignoraunce, swaruyng and varyeng altogether from the entent of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle.

that when Paule doth reason of the law, he doth chiefly meane thereby the Ceremoniall law.

Yet all this whiles, appeared not so much as one sparckle of dissention, or doubtfulnesse, nor any one question was raysed amongest the brethren, agaynst the Morall law, the keépyng whereof was yet adiudged most necessary. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie remayned as yet about the Ceremonies &amp; customes of Moyses law.

But whereas he doth nothyng els but affect their Heathenishenesse, I doe not onely not prayse him, but vtterly disallow and refuse his order of study herein. These men hauyng none other so commendable an exercize, wherein they might bestow their tyme, as by all meanes possible to beautifie the giftes and ornamentes of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and to allure men thereby to honest and seémely Ciuilitie, did worthely deserue the prayse of that, whiche they so earnestly pursued. And therfore <hi>M.

Wherein he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed such diligence and actiuitie of witte, as that him selfe did neuer better in any other Theame, nor any man els could haue handled the same more aboundauntly. And euen the same dyd he as then, accordyng to the necessitie of the present tyme, with singular learnyng: for as yet, besides the orderly course of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall doctrine, were not any other preceptes of purer disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, extaunt amongest those Nations, wherein the fine and nymble wittes might exercize them selues. And therefore it was no maruell if hee beyng a man endued with wonderfull in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct of nature, did embrace that thyng, as the chiefest felicitie, worthy whereupon he might discourse, and whiche he sawe to be most notable, and had in greatest prize amongest all the workes of Nature: neither could rayse his mynde beyonde the limites of Nature, nor stretche out the force of his capicitie, further then to that outward righteousnesse, obteyned by speciall pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suite of vertue.</p>
            <p>But now as the state of the tyme is altered from that which was then, so haue we now receaued an other Schoolemaister fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heauen, whose Maiestie, as surmounteth in glory all worldly state &amp; condition, so his doctrine being not straighted within the

<q>Not to sinne is the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
<pb facs="tcp:3766:120"/>
of God, but the righteousnesse of man is the mercyfull indulgence of God.

            <p>But why doe I stand so long vpon a matter that ought to be without all co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouersie? when as the generall consent and agreément of all learned Authours and antiquitie, can not be founde more constaunt, nor for the more part more consonaunt, in any one thyng so much, as in this. The matter therefore beyng so playne, it remayneth that of two meére contraries, we allow the one, and vtterly forsake y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other; that is to say: either that, which you doe cauill, touchyng righteousnesse or els that, which they doe teache vs touchyng Gods gracious forbearyng. For these two are farre different eche from other, and can not be admitted both: for it righteousnesse be obteyned by integritie of workes, then what neéde haue we of any further forgeuenesse? But if this come vnto us by the onely freé benignitie of the forgeuer. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seé you then for the loue ye beare to your Myter, where is now that integritie of workes? that vprightenesse that may make our righteousnesse perfect? For as farre as I can gesse, pardon is not geuen to well deseruynges, but reward rather offred as of duety: Neither can it be truely sayd: That pardon must be cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued where no offence is committed. But ye will say paraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that some imperfections doth lurcke secretly in our deédes, though they be wrought by the grace of God, which yet wanteth the mercyfulnesse of God. It is well sayd truely. And why then doth your darkyng penne so cruelly rage agaynst <hi>Luther</hi>?

vnperfect, lame, blynd, naked and so altogether barren and hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, that vnlesse they bee clothed and vpholden by the mercy of freé pardon, no defence wilbe pleadeable before the Iudgement seate of God: and shalbe accompted rather in place of sinnes, then seéme to deserue any reward of vertue. If ye be not satisfied with these testimonies, but will obstinately persiste in this your opinion still: that our workes may be so absolutely perfect as to deserue: I beseéch you make proofe therof by some reasonable authoritie, either vouched out of holy Scriptures, or out of some approued auncient Authours: And if ye can make no sou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d proofe in that behalfe, deale yet somewhat more soberly with vs. For these your reproches, rebukes, lyes, scoldynges, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cries, spyttynges, cursinges, glorious &amp; hauty speaches, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flyng wordes make nothyng to the purpose.

But howsoeuer those <hi>Lutheranes</hi> in Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d and in Germany do exercise them selues in no good workes, it goeth very well in the meane tyme with Porting all and Spayne that men lyue there holy and Angellike. For I do beleue surely that men in those Countreys do so glytter in since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of life and brightenes of vertues, that their very shadowes do shyne in the darke, and glyster more lyke Aungels then men, that they are such men as plante their feéte no where, but that they leaue behynd the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a certeine wonderfull fragrant sauour of modestie, curtesie &amp; singular chastitie, &amp; so make the very hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens in loue with their puritie, &amp; sweétenes of their vertues.</p>

As though with honest and well disposed persons fatherly cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie shall cause the children to be sluggish to do their duties? or as though the voyce of mercy doth at once vtterly abolish all Morall vertues? To what ende therefore doth Christ so much not commende vnto vs that fatherly affection in the mercyfull father mentioned in the Gospell towardes his prodigall sonne: but also painte him out vnto vs for an example? if that doctrine of the freé mercyfulnesse of God be not true, or if it be true, that it ought not therefore be published, bycause many vnchast and

               <hi>If inheritaunce come by the law, then not of promise.</hi> And in an other place. <hi>If we bee made heyres through the law, then is our fayth made frustrate, and the promise of none effect.</hi> Rome. 4.<note place="margin">Rom. 4.</note> And agayne. <hi>If righteousnesse come by the lawe then did Christ suffer in vayne.</hi> Gal. 2.<note place="margin">Galat. 2.</note> And least that your lying spirite should with sinister interpretation wrest those sentences spoken of the law to the ceremoniall law, you may heare the Apostle there tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating of that law, which was geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for offendours vntill the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised seéde should come: which law should in steéde of a Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maister lead vs (as it were) by the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d directly to Christ: which law did shut vp all vnder sinne, as well Iewes as Gentiles, that the promise might be geuen vnto the beleuers through fayth in Iesus Christ.

               <note place="margin">Pag. 146.</note>
               <hi>Ergo, not fayth but workes</hi> (sayth he) <hi>doe iustifie, which shall purchase for vs Saluation or Damnation.</hi> But this il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fauored shapen consequent which you haue most falsely deriued from true thynges and confessed, we doe vtterly deny vnto you: and not we onely, but the holy Scripture doth deny &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne: all holy write doth reiect, the whole fayth of the Euangelistes, and doctrine of the Apostle, and all the promises of God with generall consent do crye out agaynst &amp; hisse at it. If out of these places of Scripture you would haue framed an Argument a right, and accordyng to the true meanyng of the holy Ghost, ye should more aptly haue concluded in this wise. For as much therfore as there remayneth for euery of vs such a Iudgement, wherein euery one must yeld an accoumpt of his lyfe spe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, there is no cause why any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> should flatter and beguile him selfe with a vayne promise, that his wicked deédes or wordes shall escape vnpunished after this lyfe, but rather that euery man so behaue him selfe in this transitory world, that neither his good workes may appeare without fayth, nor his faith want testimony of good workes. Truely this conclusion, would haue bene preached to them (the number of whom is infinite, not onely amongest the Papistes) but also euen amongest the professours of the Gospel, who professing the name &amp; fayth of Christ, liue notwithstandyng so dissolutely as they bryng the name and doctrine of Christ in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to open obloquy.

into the gulfe of all licentious filthyues, to the great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour of almightye God, and the manifest ruine of their owne Saluation. Surely I am of opinion if you had directed your conclusion in this maner agaynst those persons, and others lyke vnto them, which do so wilfully rash and throw them selues care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lessely into manifest abhominations without all respect of equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and conscience, the consequent would more aptly haue bene applyed and of more force.</p>

            <p>But to what purpose <hi>Osorius</hi> is this alledged agaynst the Iustification of fayth in them, who hauyng receaued the fayth of Christ, doe ioyne withall fruites of obedience as companions if not altogether pure and absolutely perfect, yet do yeld their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour and abilitie at the least such as it is, after the small pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion and measure of their weakenesse. This trauaile &amp; ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour though it be farre distaunt from that exact requireth perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the law, is yet neuertheles accepted in place of most full and absolute Iustification in the sight of God, who doth supply the want of our workes with his owne freé Imputation, for the fayth sake in his sonne onely, whiche is not Imputed for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse to them that do worke, but to them that do beleue in him: For what although the horrible rebellion of the vngodly whiche walke not after the spirite but after the fleshe, doe procure vnto them selues most iust Iudgement of conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nation, yet shall this saying stand alwayes inuiolable notwithstandyng, and remayne assured for euer, <hi>The righteous shall liue by fayth: And he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leueth

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion is as ilfauoredly shapen. Doe ye expect a reason?

Let vs discusse the very order of your wordes. <hi>And they which haue done well:</hi> What they? <hi>shall come,</hi> (sayth he) <hi>into the resurrection of life. &amp;c.</hi> First of all, ye perceaue that the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes alone are not treated of simply, but the persons that doe the workes. Surely in Iudiciall Courtes is no small obseruation vsed chiefly of the difference betwixt the circumstaunces of the Causes, and circumstaunces of the persons. As when a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt shall commit the very same which a Sonne shall doe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the factes be of all partes equall, yet I suppose that the Sonne shall finde more mercy in his cause, of his Father being Iudge, then the seruaunt of his Maister being Iudge, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly where the Iudge is not constreined to yeld Iudgement by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny coaction, or expresse rigour of Statute and Law, but is at libertie to vse consideration of the trespasse, accordyng to his own discretion. Eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so, neither do I thinke it all one, if a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (I say a true Christian man) shall mainteine his cause before Christ his Redeémer, as if a Turke or Infidell should pleade before the same Christ his Iudge. And why? bycause the one is very much holpen by yeldyng his fayth to the promise, the other hath none other ayde to trust vnto, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rigour of the law. But let vs proceéde, that we may come at the last to the pricke that is shot at.

that vnto those that are founde such in the Iudgement shall ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen possession of eternall life.<note place="margin">The words of Christ expounded.</note> I heare this well. But I would fayne know at the length, what the Cause should be, why this mercyfull Iudge will vouchsafe to reward those workemen so highly?

Hereunto also may be annexed the testimonie of <hi>Basile</hi> no lesse worthy to bee noted, touchyng the mercyfull Iudgement of God towardes his chosen people, you shal heare his owne wordes as they are.
<q>For if the Iudgement of GOD were so rigorous and precise in it selfe,<note place="margin">Basil. in Psal. 32.</note> to render vnto vs after our worthynesse accordyng to the workes that we haue done, what hope were then, or what man should bee saued? But now he loueth both mercy and Iudgement, that is matchyng mercy equall with him selfe, to beare chief rule in the regall seate of Iudgement, and so bryngeth forth euery man to Iudgement. That is to say, if Gods Iudgement should proceéde of it selfe precisely and exactly, requityng euery of vs accordyng to the deseruynges of our deédes that we haue done, what hope should remayne for vs? or what one person of mankynde should be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued? But now God loueth mercy and Iudgement: And reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng mercy for him selfe, he hath placed her before the Royall Throne of Iustice, as chief gouernesse and so citeth euery man vnto Iudgement.</q>

who rakyng all thynges to amplifie the estimation of pure righteousnes, doth so stoutly defende this pointe: That all our wordes &amp; workes are of such force and value in this Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that of their owne nature they are auaylable towardes y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> purchase of the euerlastyng inheritaunce, or els do procure vs a ready downefall to euerlastyng destruction: In deede he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth truly in respect of the condemnation of the vnfaithful, and vnbeleuyng persons: and of them which beyng estraunged from fayth, haue not acknowledged Christ in this world: and of such as abusing their fayth, haue despised Christ: and of them also, which seékyng to establish their own righteousnesse, would not submit the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues to the righteousnesse of Christ.

For endeuouryng to proue agaynst the <hi>Lutheranes</hi>: That there is none other way to attayne true righteousnesse, then by liuyng vertuously: he seé<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to pretende a colour of a certeine few sentences pyked out of the Scripture, such, as him selfe scarsely vnderstandeth, or hath ilfauouredly disguised to make a shewe in his maske: and makyng no distinction meane whiles betwixte the persons and the thynges, disposing nothyng in his due place and order, but choppyng and shufflyng all thynges together in a certeine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused hotchpotte (as it were in the old vnformed <hi>Chaos</hi>) though they be as farre distau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t as heauen and earth, iumbleth them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether without all discretion, confoundyng the law w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell: the persons with the thynges them selues: righteousnesse of fayth with righteousnesse of workes: neither noteth which are the naturall causes of the thynges, nor which are the proper ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectes of the causes: but disguiseth the causes vnder title of ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectes, and effectes likewise misturneth into causes.

No liuely fruites of good workes</hi> (sayth hee) <hi>can ensue from Luthers fayth: for as much as all our doyngs are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and sinneful, as Luther him selfe witnesseth.</hi> I do heare you &amp; aunswere you. That the Antecedent is true, but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent most salfe. For to confesse that to be true, which <hi>Luther</hi> hath most truly alledged, that all our good deédes beyng viewed with the eyes of Gods Iustice, without fayth, and without the Mediatour, are of them selues no lesse abhorred in the sight of God, then wicked sinners: yet is not <hi>Osorius</hi> conclusion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore true, that <hi>Luthers</hi> fayth is the wellspryng and seédeplot of all vngodlynes. The reason therof is euident. For whatsoeuer actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, or endeuours of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s life are of their own nature blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, the fault of the same proceédeth not from fayth, but fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the poysoned corruption of our weake fleshe.

That our workes may thereby be made good wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, For as much as whatsoeuer is not of fayth, and is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not shielded vnder her protectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, deserueth not to be accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

            <p>For as much as the law in her proper effect ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do nothing, but engender wrath, and was for this purpose published, that sinne should appeare much more sinnefull.</p>
            <p>It followeth rather by <hi>Osor.</hi> doctrine (who seémeth to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the whole bent of his skil y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> glory of the law) that no good workes are engendred of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law, but sinne rather as from whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce more plentyfull matter of wrath is raysed to our destruction.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Luther</hi> handleth the matter farre otherwise, all whose Diuinitie howe much the more carefully doth enseale vnto vs the fayth of Christ, which is the onely mother, and nourse of all vertuous deédes, so much the greater encrease of good workes must of necessitie spryng by his doctrine. And therefore (as I suppose) we haue handsomely enough, for this tyme, wrong out of <hi>Osorius</hi> his fingers, this choakyng bone, wherewith he hath kept all this sturre agaynst <hi>Luther,</hi> and thrust it into his owne throate: That Luthers fayth is the well spring &amp; seede plot of all wickednes, but his faith the founteine of all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.

               <hi>Agayne bycause Luther doth affirme that the force of lust is so strong, that he beleeueth no man able to resiste it.</hi> It is a common custome (I perceaue) amongest many persons to extenuate and despise boldly Originall sinne, and that decay of nature in wordes: but I could neuer finde any one, that was able to suppresse and vtterly subdue the strength therof in deéde in this mortall lyfe: except that onely man of whom it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: <hi>Whiche of you doth accuse me of sinne?</hi> vnlesse we will cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple this our <hi>Osorius</hi> next vnto him, and make him his equall: who with singular &amp; vnspeakeable courage, doth fight agaynst nature, so stoutely (I thinke) that no force of naturall corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, no entycementes of ticklyng lust can driue him from his state of innocencie.

            <p>Paule complainyng of the sinne, which doth accosiber his flesh, doth protest, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in his flesh, dwelleth no good thing.</p>

you here Osorius. If you will first expresse vnto vs apely and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly,<note place="margin">A twosold kyngdome of Sinne.</note> what you meane by this worde kyngdome. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Deuines do agreé, that there are two sortes of sinne, whiche we call actuall sinne: whiche also they doe distinguish two ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of wayes, into Sinne reigning, and Sinne rebelling, you must teach vs, whether of those two you meane. For it is not all one thyng to suffer thy selfe to be carryed away with sinne, &amp; to yeld thy selfe willingly captiue into his Tyranny, as to be van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished of sinne through weakenes: For the first co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth of will: the next of Infirmitie: We are all many tymes ouercome of sinne, neither liueth any in this flesh, but offendeth sometymes sondry wayes.

               <note place="margin">Rom. 6.</note> Rom. 6. And yet the same Paule did not alwayes bring to passe the good y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he would. But did worke many tymes the euill that he would not: Not he now but Sinne dwellyng within him.</p>
            <p>These thynges beyng thus opened: Let vs search out the pythe of the Argument.<note place="margin">The sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunce of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussed.</note> 
               <hi>Hee denyeth that vertue hath any place there, where the kyngdome of Sinne is not vtterly rooted out.</hi> If <hi>Osorius</hi> do meane the kyngdome of Sinne, as a kyng or a tyraunt doth reigne ouer his subiectes.

That no man can enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise any good worke, vnlesse the tyranny of Sinne beyng first brought vnder yoke, he haue so tamed the fleshe, that no motion so much may bee felt to rebell within, that may wounde or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the conscience: how can <hi>Osorius</hi> make proofe of that which he verifieth in his Maior? or confute that which he doth obiect agaynst <hi>Luther</hi> in his Minor?

The Apostle both teache that <hi>we are elected and chosen, that we should become holy.</hi> This is true. Whereby you may perceaue <hi>(Osorius)</hi> that whatsoeuer holynes we be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued withall, doth neither goe before, nor accompany election, but that it ought to follow altogether, not in order of tyme one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but in respect of the end and effect thereof. For the Apostle doth not say: GOD hath chosen vs bycause we were holy, or should afterwardes proue holy, but that we should become holy: so that Gods Electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is now the cause, not the effect of our good workes. And if good workes do follow Electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in order of time, I seé no cause to the contrary, but by the same reason, our Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication should likewise necessaryly follow. For as much as the consideration of them both is all one. For whom hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen, the same he hath Iustified: and with the same grace that he hath chosen vs, hee is sayd also, to haue Iustified vs: by one selfe same meane, and to one selfe same ende. For God hath chosen vs, if ye aske here the cause: of his freé mercy accordyng to the

good pleasure of his will, if ye seéke the meane. In Christ Iesu, If ye looke for the ende to worke good deédes, not for the good deédes sake, not for any our deseruinges, but to the prayse of the glory of his grace. Truly none otherwise fareth it in the matter of Iustification. For whom God of his freé mercy hath chosen, the same also he hath freély Iustified, not by any other meanes then in Christ Iesu: not bycause he foresawe, that we would be holy, but to that ende, that we should walke circumspectly and holyly in his sight.</p>
            <p>But what emporteth this saying,<note place="margin">To be irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible how it is taken in the Scriptures.</note> that we <hi>should become ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and vnblameable?</hi> paraduenture <hi>Osorius</hi> bee of the opinion, that the <hi>Catharres, Celestines,</hi> and <hi>Donatifies</hi> were imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng, that herein our full and absolute regeneration of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed nature was signified vnto vs: and that we should accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish such a kynde of thyng as the <hi>Grecians</hi> do call <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, that <hi>Luther</hi> affirmeth that there is no freé choyse, or freédome in the will of man.</p>

Which beyng in this wise placed, it remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, that we frame our aunswere to euery of them particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as oportunitie and place shall offer them in the discourse, and so to purge and wash away (as much as in vs lyeth) all his cauillations &amp; Sophisticall subtelties. For thus would I wish
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:3766:151"/>
theé to be persuaded (frendly Reader) that besides naturall scol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng, and meére cauteles of wordes voyde of all substaunce of truth, there is els nothyng of all whatsoeuer he doth brabble in all this discourse, yea &amp; that also stroakyng him selfe rather with vayne conceipt of his own opinion, then of any grounded know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or Iudgement at all.</p>
               <p>And first as touchyng <hi>Freewill:</hi> In steéde of a proofe &amp; testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of <hi>Luthers</hi> owne workes and yet the same also, neither doth he alledge whole as they be, nor fully: nor doth hee couple the first with the last: nor directeth to any certeine place of the Authour. But goe to. What maner of haynous crime is this (a Gods name) wherewith this Portingall Inquisitour doth charge <hi>Luther</hi> so greéuously &amp; cruelly? Forsooth it is this: That he did dare mutter against <hi>Freewill,</hi> Saying that it was a thing in tittle onely: and whiles it followeth his owne nature, it doth nothyng but sinne deadly. And where is this written? In the volumes of <hi>Luther</hi> (I suppose) or els in <hi>Sybilles</hi> leaues. Seéke there Reader, or els where if thou wilt. For as our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Maister Inquisitour assigneth no place to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Reader, so (I thinke) he neuer did read in <hi>Luther</hi> the thyng, whereat he cauil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth: nor thinketh that it concerneth his credite at all to vtter whatsoeuer him listeth, in what sense, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> what phrase of speache, by what authoritie, or with what testimonies it bee bolstered so that somewhat bee suggested whereat hee may frame some qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell. But proceéde on, and what followeth? <hi>Then afterwardes the same Luther correctyng him selfe,</hi> what sayth he farther? <hi>I haue erred</hi> (sayd hee) <hi>I spake vntruely: that Freewill is a thyng in name onely before the tyme of grace</hi>:<note place="margin">Luther in his Assertio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Article. 36.</note> 
                  <hi>but I should haue sayd simply. That Freewill is a fayned deuise or a tittle without all substaunce. Luther</hi> in his Assertions writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth the 36. Article. Well and what is it at last, that this Maister Inquisitour will frame vnto vs out of this? <hi>Ergo,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 151.</note> 
                  <hi>Luther is an heretique, who dispoyleth man of all his Freewill, and traueileth chiefly to this end, to affirme that mans mynde is alwayes holden captiue, his will fast bound, all power of workyng taken away, in so much that we can do neither good nor euill, nor ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thinke a thought so much by any meanes. And this doth not Luther teach onely: but
<pb facs="tcp:3766:152"/>
Melancthon also aboundauntly, yea much more plentyful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Caluine doth debate the same.</hi> I not heare you <hi>Osorius</hi> &amp; do aunswere, not I for <hi>Luther,</hi> but <hi>Luther</hi> shall aunswere ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for him selfe.</p>
               <p>And first touchyng that whiche we terme mans choyse, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ye conster it to be reason, or will: surely <hi>Luther</hi> did neuer deny. The same dare I boldly affirme in the behalfe of <hi>Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cthon</hi> and <hi>Caluine</hi> also. Certes these men were neuer so rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably madde, as to despoyle man (whom they define to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with reason) of reason and of will. For by no reason ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the operation of will be sequested from that part,<note place="margin">The repulse of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill.</note> where the vse of reason resteth.

And therfore as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernyng those naturall properties of will, <hi>Luther</hi> was neuer so foolishe, nor any of all the <hi>Lutheranes,</hi> as to exclude that will from nature by any meanes, which nature it selfe had engraffed into men. Let this therfore remayne vnshaken in this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie as touchyng the substau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of <hi>Freewill,</hi> that the essenciall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce therof vnited together with sensible reason doth alwayes cleaue inseparably to nature:<note place="margin">The sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunce of Freewill is neuer seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from Nature.</note> which neither <hi>Luther</hi> deny, nor any of all the <hi>Lutheranes</hi> did euer deny. What is it then (will you say) that <hi>Luther</hi> did deny in <hi>Freewill?</hi> I will tell you: so that your vnderstandyng be able to conceaue it.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Adam crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</note>It is out of all controuersie that <hi>Adam</hi> in his first creation, was endued with wonderfull and absolute freédome of will: to the vpholdyng of which freédome of will, the grace of God was not wantyng at that tyme, without the which he could not stand fast in that good will, wherein he was created though he would: now to haue a will to stand fast was not geuen him, but was left in the power of his <hi>Freewill,</hi> and so left, that if hee would haue stoode fast, hee had neuer bene euill, if he would not bene euill. And yet neither could he bee good through the force of his owne <hi>Freewill,</hi> without Gods speciall grace. But what did he? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng thus left in the power of his owne <hi>Freewill,</hi> when he neither
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:3766:152"/>
would stand fast, nor could fall without sinne: By Sinnyng (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busing his owne freédome) he brought to passe, that he both lost and cast away him selfe, and his freédome withall: and yet not in such wise, as that there remained in him neither sense, nor feé<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng, nor vse of will: but he so lost it, that, whereas he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore immortall and freé, now hath he both lost his freédome, and also his immortalitie and righteousnesse withall. Whereby it came to passe, that the wretched man (by losing that pure freé<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of good will, which he receaued in his first creation) pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased to him selfe and all his posteritie most miserable and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable bondage. Now therfore beyng clogged and fastened to this state of bondage (as it were cloyed in claye) albeit after a certeine sorte we reteine still that power of vnderstandyng and appetite, whereby the mynde of her freé motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is able to discerne betwixt sensible obiectes: yet can we neuer of our selues aspire agayne to that vprightenesse and immortalitie, which we haue lost: for beyng now fast yoaked, and sold vnder this yoake of ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitude, we doe serue such a seruile thraldome in this fleshe, that we can turne our selues to no one side, through any force of freé<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, but we shall alwayes be the bondslaues of sinne &amp; death, vnlesse the grace of Christ do helpe vs, and set vs at libertie.</p>
               <p>Whereby you may easily perceaue <hi>(Osorius)</hi> what is the state and condition of <hi>Freewill:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">How mans will is free, &amp; not free.</note> to witte: that in one sense it may be taken not altogether freé, and agayne in an other sense, not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise but freé. For if ye call backe the nature of mankynd to her first creation, and then will demaunde generally, whether there be no freé will in nature? I doe aunswere. That nature it selfe was created vpright at the first, &amp; that God the good Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour endued it with <hi>Freewill:</hi> but that man him selfe became ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to that freédome, &amp; destroyed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same in nature vtterly. But if you will proceéde, &amp; make a further question, &amp; demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de what kynde of will (after sinne entred once) was in man towardes na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall euill thyngs, and towardes deceitfull good thynges?

<pb facs="tcp:3766:153"/>
thereunto &amp; will boldly confesse y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is bond, seruile, &amp; altogether captiuate, vnlesse it be hoipen.

                  <hi>Freewill</hi> (sayth he) <hi>is nothing worth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse God doe gouerne the same.</hi> And immediately after. <hi>To this effect is thy will, whiche is called free, apt and sufficient, that by doing ill, it becommeth a damnable bondmayde. &amp;c.</hi> Harken <hi>Osorius.</hi> If it be a bondmayde, now is it not freé the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

For as much as <hi>Freewill</hi> is not all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like in the persons that are regenerate, and in them that are not regenerate: and for as much as libertie also is to be construed in humane actions after one sort, but taken after a contrary co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction in spirituall exercizes: hee must (I say) tell me which sorte of <hi>Freewill,</hi> or what maner of actions he doth treate of. If he meane that <hi>Freewill,</hi> which is now gouerned by the Spirite of God: Surely <hi>Luthers</hi> position maketh therof no mention at all.

For of what force is mans <hi>Freewill</hi> els towardes the thynges that apperteine vnto God, before it haue receaued grace, then as a dead man without lyfe?

Albeit I know right well, that they doe not varie from <hi>Luthers</hi> meanyng, yet did they alwayes of very purpose refrayne from this kynde of speache.

Who euer heard <hi>Bucer</hi> say, that man was not of power to thinke euill? not bycause they varied from him in meanyng and Iudgement, but they chose rather to quallifie, with some more plausible kynde of stile, that which seémed to be propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded by him somewhat more roughly.

Or bycause the freédome of doyng is restreined to the first and principall cause, to witte, to the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Maiestie of God, that therefore mans will is no cause at all, bycause it is not freé? and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> therfore it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thinke no ill thought by any meanes, bycause it doth it not of her owne strength and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, as though to do a thyng properly? &amp; a thyng to be done of her owne proper power, were all one to say? So then by this reason the Iewes, which crucified the Lord of glory, shalbe sayd to do nothyng, bycause all the outrage whatsoeuer they kept, was determined before, by Gods vnsearcheable cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sell.

the tydes do driue them.

                  <p>Certes this saying of <hi>Luther</hi> is vndoubtedly true, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng happeneth in all the actions of mans lyfe, either well, or euill, either without Gods knowledge, or without his will, or els without his direction.

And therefore that Sophisme of yours is altogether Sophisticall &amp; deceauable, not much vnlike to that, whiche we read in <hi>Origine</hi> in his second booke agaynst <hi>Celsus</hi>: where the Sophister, to dissuade the sicke body from counsell of Phisicke,<note place="margin">Origene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus. 2. booke</note> frameth this Argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.

If it be thy destiny to haue issue of thy body, thou shalt haue one, whether thou marry a wife, or not marry a wife: but if thou be predestinate to be childlesse, thou shalt surely be childies, though thou marry a wife neuer so much. The deceite of this So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phisme

                     <hi>For correcting of vyce</hi> (sayth he) <hi>punishment is ministred for two causes.

And although it ought not to be doubted that ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s will ought to be subiect to Gods will, whom ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can not let to worke what him best liketh, for as much as when him listeth, he frameth mans will to worke after his will, yet here is no cause to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but that man should receaue due punishement for the offences, which him selfe committeth willfully, seyng that he is the worker of his owne Sinne, for no man Sinneth agaynst his will. The other cause why transgressours are worthely punished, is bycause the tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passours either are regenerate, and such beyng cleansed before, and fallyng agayne to their former filthe, of their owne accorde, can not pleade for defence that they neuer receaued grace: as men who through their own Freewill, haue made frustrate the Grace of God once receaued, by their owne wickednesse: But if they be not rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, yet is that damnable originall sinne worthely punished: that

For whereas that blessednes was promised to the posterity of Abraham, here might some scrupule haue troubled his minde, as there wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not of the Iewes some that pyked hereout matter to cauill vpon, as though God had broken the promise that he once had made, as one that hauing obliged hymselfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with so many couenauntes, and promises to this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, did now contrary to his othe cast them of and des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pise them. S. Paule valiauntly impugning the disorderous reproches and cauillations of these with sondry forcible reasons, doth fortifie this his defence with iiij. Argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes chiefly. First, that this promise of the blessing was made in deede to Abraham, and Israell, and to their posteritie: but this promise in as much as is spiritually to be taken, did not so restrayne it selfe onely to that externall Family alone af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the kinred of the fleshe, as that it noted not vnder the same fellowshyppe and kinred of Israell, the Gentiles also, such especially as were endued with like sincerity of fayth.

Forasmuch therefore as our expositours in all these poynts of doctrine, haue nothing at all hitherto swarued from the truth of Paules doctrine, or your interpretation, what corrupt exposition is that at the length of these our Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, wherewith you are so much offended? <hi>forsooth,</hi> (say you) <hi>because they doe not sufficiently enough conceaue the very ende, whereunto Paule did referre those argumentes.</hi> Goe to then. sith you prouoke vs hereunto. Let vs first seé what argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes those be of Paule: then to what ende they be applied: Because the Iewes did challenge to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues a title of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes through the obseruaunce of the law, which neuerthelesse they did not obserue in very deéde, partely (because swelling w<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pryde for the Nobilitie of their race,) they did promise vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>selues a certaine peculiar election with God before all other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) Paule entending to treate very sharply agaynst the inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent arrogancie of them, doth argue agaynst the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with most forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble argumentes, taken out of holy Scriptures, namely. That the substance of Gods election neither did hang vpon the works of the Law, neyther vpon the roialtie of race, not yet vpon aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient of parentage, but did depend vpon the onely freemercy of Gods compassion and Fayth of the Gospell. And to make the same appeare more euidently, he putteth foorth vnto them the example of Isaac and Ismaell,<note place="margin">Examples of Isaac and Iacob. Isma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el and Esau.</note> whereof the one though by byrth were yonger, yet obtained through grace to be the first, and was thereby aduaunced to the dignity of inheritaunce, where as they both were generall issues of one, and the same father Abraham, though they had not both one mother. And to auoyde y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger of scrupule, that might ensue, by reason of the two mothers, hee doth yet confirme the same with a more notable exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple. Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the example of the two brothers that were twinnes <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Esau</hi> who issuing of one Father, of one mother, and one birth, and before they had done any thing good, or euill, God did tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slate the honour of birthright and blessing to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> yonger, to beare rule ouer the elder. And whereof came this? but from the freé gift of election, whereas before there was nothing in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantes

(beyng not yet borne,) that might eyther deserue to beé aduaunced, or to be reiected. If you respect the worthines of their workes, what had the seély infantes done before they were borne? but if this whole matter did depend vpon the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods vnsearcheable counsell, what rewarde here doe mens workes deserue? namely whereas God spake to Moyses in playnest maner of speach.<note place="margin">Rom. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>I will haue mercy on him on who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I will shew mercy, and will haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>passion on him on whom I haue compassion.</hi> Whereunto agreéth the testimony of Paule immediately vttered by the same spirite, <hi>It is not of him that willeth nor in him that runneth, but in GOD that sheweth mercy.</hi> Againe alledging the example of Pharao, with sembla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reason co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmeth the same by the example of Gods seuerity,<note place="margin">The exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rao.</note> that he debated before of his freémercy.</p>

bypathes aside, the Apostle doth deny <hi>that election springeth out of workes</hi>: What aunswere you to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apostle <hi>Osorius</hi>? you will vouch that old rotten ragge, worne out to the hard stumps by your schoolemen, to witte, <hi>that the workes that were fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seene: are the cause of predestination, not those whiche are done but which are to be done,</hi>

                  <p>First if this be true which you did earst confesse, and whiche <hi>Pighius</hi> doth euery where inculcate, that of all thinges whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer, nothing is to come, or past, but is as it were present in the sight of God: Agayn if there be no diuersitie of times with God, because his knowledge comprehendeth (as you say) all thinges past, present, and to come, as though they were present in view: how can hys election, or reiection spring out of workes then, that are yet to be done?<note place="margin">Workes foreseene are in no respect the cause of Gods elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> If they bee present: in what sence call you them to be done in after tyme? but if they be to come, and to bee done in after tyme: how call you them present? or how doe these thinges agree together, that there is nothing to come in respect of the foreknowledge of God, and yet that election must be beleued to issue fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out the foreknowledge of works to come?</p>

                  <p n="3">3. Whereas the Scripture doth manifestly declare,<note place="margin">The third Reason.</note> that we are created &amp; elected to good workes: it appeareth ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that good workes are the effectes of Predestination.</p>
                  <p>But the effectes ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be the cause of that, wherof they were the effectes.</p>

For God did also foreknow the euill will of the reprobate (as there is nothyng in the world, that his vnsearcheable purpose did not foreknow) euen aswell, as he foreknew before the glory of the elect that should come: yet did he not therfore chuse vnto glory some, bycause he foreknew the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor did chuse all thynges, which he did foreknow: but whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer his Electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had predestinated, it is out of all doubt, that the same were all foreknowen.</p>

Agayne the foreseéne pety workes (which they make to be the cause of Election) are either our owne, or properly apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teynyng to God. If they be Gods, and not ours: where then is the freédome of our choyse? any merites of works: But if they be ours, that is to say, in the direction of our owne willes: then is that false, that Paule teacheth. <hi>God it is, that worketh in vs both to will and to worke,</hi> declaryng hereby: that we are vnable to will, or to attemp any thyng that good is, without Gods assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunce.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Now therfore as concernyng the will of the <hi>Potter,</hi> left any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shall thinke that his will is vnaduised, nor directed by equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and reason: The Apostle doth forthwith set downe the cause, therewith the mouth of the slaunderous backbyter may be stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped. <hi>To shew</hi> (sayth he) <hi>the riches of his glory towardes the vessels of mercy which he hath prepared vnto glory. &amp;c.</hi> He doth not say: bycause God foresaw the good workes of the godly, and the euill doynges of the wicked, that these were therfore ordeyned to da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, those other chosen to saluation: but hee sayth, that those are prepared to destruction, whom he would haue to be vessells of wrath, &amp; the others to glory. And yet this notw<hi rend="sup">t</hi>standyng nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnaduisedly, nor contrary to equitie. Wherein if any man be desirous to know y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reason, or the Iustice of God in his prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stination,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:3766:214"/>
let him heare <hi>Augustine</hi> herein. <hi>The whole masse of mankinde was subiect</hi> (sayth he) <hi>to one state of perdition rightly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruyng the scourge of Gods Iustice:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">August. ad simplici. Lib. 1. Quaest. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>which whether be executed, or pardoned, proceedeth not of any vnrighteousnesse in God. Now it pleased Gods good will of his mercy to make a choyse of some of these, and to relinquish other accordyng to his Iustice. If you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a reason hereof, the Apostle doth not hyde it from you: To make knowen</hi> (sayth he) <hi>the riches of his glory towardes the vesselles of mercy, which he hath prepared vnto Glory. &amp;c.</hi> Wherein the principall and first cause of doyng, is ioyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the last end therof. In the meane space many meanes are enterlaced betwixt these two. For euen as the will of God doth not otherwise preferre his elect to the honour of glory, but as it were through many tribulations, so neither doth he exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the seueritie of his Iudgement agaynst the Reprobate by &amp; by,<note place="margin">In Predest. the first cause must be coupled with the last end.</note> but by long sufferau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, much lenitie and tolleration of their wickednesse. But as the afflictions of the elect is not the cause of their saluation, so neither the lenitie and long sufferaunce of the wicked, is the principall cause that moueth God to exercize the seueritie of his Iustice agaynst them. And therfore are they called <hi>Vessells:</hi> the one sorte vessells of wrath, the other vessels of mercy prepared either to destruction, or to saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> first, and before either God did with patience endure the wickednesse of the one, or with tribulations exercize the Fayth of the other.</p>
                  <p>To conclude therfore in few wordes briefly: I come agayne to the Argument that was proposed, which albeit he choppeth together without all order of teachyng: yet in my conceite, a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may briefly reduce it into this forme. For out of these wordes of Paule, wherewith God is sayd to haue borne with the vessels of wrath in much lenitie, <hi>Osorius</hi> doth gather his cutted Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logisine with a wonderfull dexteritie of witte.</p>

                     <note place="margin">The will &amp; purpose of God the first cause.</note>First, you will not deny but that this will of God, wherewith he had decreéd both to shew hys wrath (that is to say the seueri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Iustice) and his mercy also, was euen from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. This will then beyng once determined vpon by God, could neyther by any meanes be made of none effect, nor againe by any meanes made discernable, vnles it were poured out vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on some matter,<note place="margin">Election &amp; Predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</note> whereupon it might worke. And euen here doth that wonderfull Electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God display it selfe at the first, wherewith (before the foundations of the world were layd) he had predestinated them whom he would should be saued, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he would haue da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned. Next vnto this Election, immediately ensued the <hi>Creation</hi>:<note place="margin">Creation.</note> wherewith the almighty Creator with a most singuler excellency, and exquisit work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship did forme all vessels out of one selfe lump of Clay, and yet not those all ingenerall appoynted to one ende. For some vessels he made to serue to shew forth hys mercy,<note place="margin">Calling ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordyng to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</note> some other to shew forth his Iustice. These things being thus established, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after Creation ensueth <hi>Vocation</hi> or <hi>Callyng</hi>: &amp; the same two maner of wayes: accordyng to hys purpose, and not according to his purpose:<note place="margin">Vocation accordyng to purpose.</note> wherof the one is lynked with Grace making acceptable: the other is voyde of Grace: though not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together, yet destitute of effectuall Grace. And hereupon doe issue Blindenesse, Rebellion, Hardenesse of hart, Infidelitie, Breache of the Law, Execution of Iustice, not by force of any coaction, but by reason of the sequele or consequent. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grace of God once denying assistance, what soeuer remayneth in man is nought els, but the seéde of the Serpent, or some vncurable <hi>Fistula,</hi> wherewith man is deadly poysoned. Agayne out of the

Now out of that Infidelitie, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of Iustice, ariseth the destruction of the Reprobate: of the which Paule treateth here, which is not without the speciall will of God, Or els in what sense doth he say, <hi>God was willing to shew his wrath?</hi> and yet not without their most due deseruing nei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther: as on the other side <hi>Saluation</hi> and <hi>Glorification</hi> do spring of <hi>Fayth</hi> &amp; <hi>Iustification,</hi> for asmuch as in them, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his Iustice, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dignite of hys mercy doth shew forth their bright beames to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> inestimable glory of gods maiesty,<note place="margin">The Glory of God, the last end.</note> who is the chief and principall ende and foundation of all workes.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore forasmuch as God was willing to shew both, as well hys wrath, as also hys mercy: and this hys will could by no meanes be acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plished, vnlesse there were some vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whom, both hys wrathe, and hys mercy might make hys power on eche part discernable: hereupon then is no small stoare of proofe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred, wherby may be perceaued, from whence aswell the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of the reprobate, as the Saluation of the elect doth proceéde. And first of all your selfe do not deny, that godly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons are predestinated vnto glory through the onely bountiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of God. I demaunde now whether thys selfe same mercy of God haue predestinated to glory all creatures generally, or not all? I attend your aunswere. If you will say all without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, where then are the vessels of wrath? what shalbe come of this saying. <hi>God willing to shew hys wrath vpon the Vessels ordey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to destruction?</hi> Finally what shalbe thought of that saying of Christ? <hi>Many are called but few are chosen.</hi> If so be that all are receaued by a generall Electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: how can this Election be made frustrate and vneffectuall? or what kinde of Reiection can there be then? But if you will not say all, it followeth then, that there must bee some Uessells of reiection of Necessitie, as well as of mercy: to witte: by like agreablenesse of contraries. Or els how shall a man vnderstand that some vessels are Predestinate to Glory? vnlesse by the same Argument ye confesse that some vessels were also reiected to dishonor, which beyng agreé vpon I demaund further, of the reprobation of them that are forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,

whether do ye think that the same proceéded from the secret purpose of God: or of themselues? if from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues? how shall thys appeare? for asmuch as Election, and Reprobation also, are not seperated by any distinction of the Creator, or distaunce of tyme, and were both together before the foundacions of the world were layed: as appeareth most manifestly by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Esau,</hi> and sundry other semblable examples.</p>

                  <p>Moreouer where it is sayd that wickednesse doth make the vessels of wrath, is not agreable with the truth. <hi>Dauid</hi> did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitt agaynst his owne soule not one wickednesse alone: no more was <hi>Saule</hi> beyng a persecutour cleare of his proper wickednes

                  <p>Besides this also, if it be true that <hi>Osorius</hi> speaketh: <hi>That wicked men do not make them selues vessels of wrath, but through their owne will and wickednesse.</hi> Tell vs a good fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loshyp, what offence hadd <hi>Esau</hi> committed beyng the vessell of wrath, not by any action of lyfe, but beyng borne euen so by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?

Now because this could not be brought to passe by any other meanes, vnlesse there were some on the contrary part, vpon whome the seueritie of Gods Iustice might be exequuted: it seémed good therefore to the Almighty Creator of all the creation in this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakeable Workshop of the whole world) to dispose his vessels to seuerall vses, not all vnto honor, nor yet all vnto dishonor, but some he made seruiceable instrumentes of hys Iustice, other some meéte instruments of hys mercy: not y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he created his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to this effect, as to the finall and vtmost end of hys pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, that they should perish: but because he had so determined with himselfe in his secret counsell before the foundations of the world, not to haue mercy vpon all, therefore it could not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise be, but that such as should be forsaken of him, beyng

But for as much as: God doth compell no man to committe wickednesse, but rather yeldeth them ouer whom he forsaketh to their owne lustes, hereupon doth it conseque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly follow, that the first seédes of originall corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (beyng destitute of the grace of God) suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng vppe more deadly poyson of ragyng lust by the contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous motions of it owne naturall will,<note place="margin">The effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cause.</note> cleane contrary to Gods will, is become by that meanes the cause and procurour of his owne destruction.

Then if we graunt, that this is acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plished through the effectuall and determinate decreé and will of God, and withall that no man is able to withstand his will: what shall we conclude then? That the Reprobate are altogether excusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, bycause the fault to their reprobation resteth wholy in God? This saying in deéde thus spoken might seéme to be somewhat paraduenture, if so be that God had not made man perfect, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he created him at the first, and had not enioyned him a law and rule of righteousnesse, and had not strengthened him w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a sound freédome of will, adding thereunto further a certeine seuere cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of wholesome counsell, and a fatherly forewarnyng of the daunger that would ensue.

                  <p>
                     <hi>But the Osorianes will deny that this ought to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to Predestination or Gods decree,<note place="margin">How Gods sufferaunce dealeth in mens acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or life.</note> but to hys suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feraunce onely.</hi> Certes this is not to be doughted, but that God doth permit and suffer the thinges which he hath decreéd: But they do winne nothing by thys distinction: seéing that they fall back into the same quauemire out of the which they can by no meanes cleare themselues.

But some man will say: Seéing that the fall of Adam might haue bene stayed by an onely becke of Gods countenaunce, if it were not his pleasure so to do, why yet at the least would he not make stay of that welspring of Sinne in Adam?<note place="margin">Whether Gods suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce or hys will beare more rule in mans lyfe.</note> so that the same might not haue raunged to any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther infection of the posteritie.

The premisses considered, what remayneth? but that of Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity we yeld, that he did will y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thinges which he foreknew would come to passe, as not restrayning the proceéding thereof, beyng otherwise of ability enough to stopp &amp; ouerthrow it quite if heé would: Or els how shall Paules saying be true, <hi>He taketh mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy on whom he will haue mercy, &amp; he doth harden whom he will,</hi> if we make this an infallible rule that these thinges are suffered contrary to Gods will, or not performed by his will? forasmuch as he doth all what soeuer him listeth both in heauen &amp; in earth.</p>

                     <note place="margin">A dubble obiection.</note>But loe a new onset agayn vpon vs: <hi>If this be true, then must it needes follow: that both God is the Author of Sinne, and withall that men were created by him to destruction also.</hi> I do aunswere to both the obiections. First that God is not the Author of Sinne, but the Author of his own creature: out of which creature sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth Sinne: so that Sinne now is the work of the Creature, not of the Creator. Secondly where it is obiected. That
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:3766:223"/>
God did create hys creatures to destructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: this is most vntrue: for God doth condemne nothing of hys owne nature, but sinne onely: when God created man at the first, he created hym per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, vpright,<note place="margin">The origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of sinne is to be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed vnto the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture not vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour.</note> and without Sinne: he indued him also with freé, &amp; absolute abilitie, not to sinne: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he armed hym with sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t furniture agaynst sinne, to witte: with an especiall admonitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, so that the matter doth sufficiently declare it selfe, that God did so make man that he should not perish but be saued. Afterwardes sinne began to bud out, taking the sappe thereof not from God, but from Sathan,<note place="margin">God dyd not create man to the ende he should pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish.</note> &amp; the freéwill of man. Wherupon immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ensued damnation, not layed vpon mans shoulders by reason of his creation, but willingly purchased by reason of his owne Sinne. For if Adam had stood fast, in that vprightnes, wherein he was created, and God had condemned hym then, beyng in that vprightnes, there might haue bene some cause peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that might haue moued him to this iust complaynt: That God by hys bare decreé had vniustly created hys owne creature to the end that he should be damned. But now sithence the whole race of mankinde did cast it selfe vnderfoote, through the default of hys own lust, and not through Gods default, this will be a good aunswere to the questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: That God did not make hys crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture vnto destruction, but that the creature it selfe, by defiling it selfe with sinne, contrary to the dignitie of hys creation,<note place="margin">Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce the cause of damnation sprang at the first.</note> hath made it selfe an abhominable and vgly chaungeling, and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed it selfe from the creature of God, into the creature of the Serpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. So that the creator himself in destroying hys creature may well be adiudged to haue condemned now not his creature which he made, but the creature of Sathan, which the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent destroyed.</p>
                  <p>But you will say: <hi>Then was the Image of God deformed as soone as it was created.</hi> I know it: but by whose default? by Gods default? or mans default? but why did not the good creator of the world forbid it to be done, when as he foresaw it would come to passe?<note place="margin">The Obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed.</note> As though he gaue not an especiall commaundement to the same effect in playne wordes.

<pb facs="tcp:3766:224"/>
For what do ye reade? was not Adam forbidden to touch the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Apple of vnlucky knowledge? was he not carefully ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished, and forewarned by denouncing the daunger that would ensue thereupon? And beyng sufficiently armed with the power of <hi>Freewill,</hi> hadd he not strength enough in him selfe to take heéde? why the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did he not looke to him selfe at the least in sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, if he were not willyng to beleue and obey Gods aduertize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Certes as lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g as her reprosed him selfe, &amp; his whole sauetie in the saue keépyng and custody of the Lord, he was in no daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger at all.

And yet neither in this behalfe, did Gods fatherly goodnesse deny his as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistaunce: for euen for this so are also he made a playster: And to Cure this vniuersall poyson of nature, he gaue as vniuersall a <hi>Mythridatu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> made with the precious bloud of his onely begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Sonne: wherewith the weakest Creature in the world, and the most ouerwhelmed with Sinne might easily atteyne reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of eternall lyfe.</p>
                  <p>For as much therefore as mankinde was of euery side so wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derfully fensed, with so many and so great benefites of Gods gracious mercy: what is there that any man may eyther want to be supplied by thys our most bountifull God, and Creator? or what could this good and mercifull God, haue done more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally for hys creatures? but here bursteth out more contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and quarreling amongest the deuines, wherein they plunge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues to much. For whereas this fayth in Christ is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to all persons, and that the greater sort of people do not acknowledge the sonne of God, and that he is not so faythfully Reuerenced, as becommeth: and that they repose not the safety of their imbecillitie in this Christ as they should: now commeth here the question, what the cause should be then of this hys re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? from whence it proceédeth? from out the will of men? or or from out the decreé of God? or out of both causes beyng cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled together? <hi>Osorius</hi> here grounding hys authoritie vpon his fine <hi>Cicero</hi> doth very mightely affirme. <hi>That they were ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore made the vessels of wrath because they would not be made the vessels of mercy.</hi> But how this may be true, I can not conceaue sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly. Although I do not deny this, that those which eare made vessels of wrath are altogether replenished w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a rebellious will, wherewith they do voluntarily forsake the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered grace of their vocation, yet this same will is not the cause of reprobation, but the effect rather: &amp; doth follow, and not go before it, and it selfe is made rather, then maketh reiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For neither such as be razed out of the booke of Election, are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore become the vessels of wrath, because they did forsake mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cye:
<pb facs="tcp:3766:225"/>
but they doe therfore throw away mercy offred vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause beyng excluded from the grace of Electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they were fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoynted to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Uessels of wrath &amp; castawayes: so that <hi>Osor.</hi> might haue spoken more truely, on this wise: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> such were made y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vessels of wrath, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God would not haue to be the Uessels of mercy: And for thys cause those Pharaonicall persequutors of the church were subiect to wrath: not onely because they will not be partakers of Gods mercy, but also because they cannot.</p>

If Gods mercy so largely poured abroad and so freé<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offered (as you seeme to blaze it out) doe extend it selfe to all persons indifferently without exception, why do not all persons then indeffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly repayre vnto Christ? at the least, why is not the greatest part drawne vnto him? forsooth <hi>because they will not</hi> (say you) You are come back agayne to the first question: For I demaund what the cause is why they will not, but because it is not geuen vnto them? so that ye may perceaue now, the very welspring of this fountayne springeth not from mans will, but from the counsell of God. Or els how doth Christ name them which be hys, to be but few in number? but that he foreknew as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suredly that it would be so: or how did he foreknow it? but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was decreed first of an infallible certeinty: And therfore Christ teaching his disciples spake openly and playnly vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <hi>That it was geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto them to know the misteries of the kingdome but to others in parables,<note place="margin">Luke. 8.</note> that seeing they might not see, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they might not heare.</hi> Likewise Peter confirmed by the same spirite (speaking of the rock of offence) doth openly denounce,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 2.</note> not onely what they should do which should be offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded at Christ, but also that they were ordayned of very purpose so to doe. And yet I will not deny that which they teach of the mercy of God. I do know and confesse that it is farre and wyde dispersed abroad euery where, and that the same mercy of GOD denyeth it selfe to no person (as <hi>Augustine</hi> sayth) but to such as will not receaue it. But in thys same very mercy neuerthelesse two thinges are to be considered:<note place="margin">Two things to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</note> That God doth not onely offer those promises of benefites and blessings, of his meére mercy &amp; bounteous libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie: but also that he doth inspire y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hart of man inwardly with hys spirite, to receaue those thinges that be offered.</p>
                  <p>And so after the first maner of speakyng, I do confesse, that there is a certayne generall grace of God,<note place="margin">Whether Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall to all indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and how it is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.</note> and a certayne freé choyse of Election layed open to all, without exception: that he may receaue it, that hath a will to receaue it, so that vnder thys word layd <hi>open</hi> Gods outward calling be vnderstanded, which consisteth in preceptes, in exhortatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, in Rules, writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> either in the tenne Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundementes, or in the conscience, or in prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
<pb facs="tcp:3766:226"/>
of the word.<note place="margin">Grace of Vocation.</note> And in this sense may we rightly say: y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rao hymself wanted not the grace of God, nor <hi>Saule</hi>: no nor any of the rest, whom he did oftentimes allure with ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tle promises: terrifie w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> miracles, reward with giftes, enuyte to repentau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce with prolonging of punishment: suffer with much patience allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring &amp; calling all men dayly to amendment of lyfe.

                  </p>
                  <p>But after the second maner of speakyng: if we behold the mercy of GOD, and that grace which maketh acceptable or if we respect that will of his, wherewith he not onely willeth all to be saued, but wherewith hee bringeth to passe, that these whom he will, shalbe saued: the matter doth declare it selfe suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently:<note place="margin">Grace of Election.</note> that that Mercy and Grace of acceptyng those thyngs, whereunto they are called is not layd open for all and euery one indifferently, but is distributed through a certeine speciall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation and peculiar Election of God: whereby they that are called accordyng to the purpose of his grace, are drawen to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent. By meanes wherof it commeth to passe, that the same cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng accordyng to Gods purpose fayling, euery man hath not in his own hand to chuse, or refuse that earnest desire and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Grace indifferently offered, but such as haue either recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the gift of God, or are denyed the gift of God. Neither doth the matter so wholy depende vpon the choyse of our will, either in chusing, or refusing totally: for then might it be verified, that there was no Predestination, before the foundations of the world were layd, if our Electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were necessaryly guided by our willes, and that our will were the foundation of our Saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Therfore whereas they say, that God doth accept them, which will embrace his grace, and reiect the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which will not receaue it, is altogether vntrue. Nay it rather had bene more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient to fetch our fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teine fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the wellspring of Grace, then fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> puddle of our owne will. So that we might speake more truly, on this wise:<note place="margin">Fayth and Saluation take their originall from Grace rather then from our owne will.</note> That God doth endue vs with his grace, and fauorable countenaunce, bycause we should be willyng to embrace his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaunces and Commaundementes: on the contrary part, as concernyng those that will not receaue his grace offered, that such do worthely perish. And that the very cause, that they will not receaue it, doth hereof arise, bycause their will is not holpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:

that his argumentes are not throughly resolued: I will auswere in few wordes on thys wyse. It cannot be denyed that few are chose<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and many called: yet is not the goodnes of God any ioate impeached in this respect, nor his cruelty encreased. First in that he did choose few, or any at all: was an especiall work of his goodnes. Then, in that it pleased hym to proclayme a generall calling to the participacion of hys Gospell for all men vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally, was also a poynt of great clemency: but in that those y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are called do not come, proceéded not of any cruelty in God, no nor yet is any fault thereof to be layd to hys charge, but vnto mens disobedience: but how can it be sayd to be mans fault say you, seéing that not their willes, but Gods predestination withstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them so, that they cannot be able to come? In deede that mens will is no obstacle vnto them to come, this doth no man affirme: for hereof springeth all the faulte y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is in man.<note place="margin">That those that are not chosen doe not come how mans will &amp; gods predestina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: do se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerally work.</note> Agayne to saye that Gods eternall Predestination is no preiudice to them that fall away, surely no man can deny this likewise: but how this predestination of God is an Estoppell, must be seene: not by powringe in new poyson (for that neédeth not) but by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking the olde: thus therefore the will of man is an obstackle, but not alone: So is Predestination also an obstackle, but not without the will of man.

                  <p>And first Gods Predestination in deéde hath her operation according to the infallible will of hys most freé decreé, not so much in the thinges themselues, as most inespeciall in the wils of men: and expresseth in this their will such a kynde of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, that it felfe in the meane tyme is forced of none, and doth alwayes goe before the actions of mans will, and doth guyde and gouerne those wills: whiche direction and conduct mans will doth atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vpon: which withall worketh also in things subiect vnto it, and after a certaine maner of her owne, doth moue it selfe freély, that is to say, doth with earnest affection be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it selfe willingly of her owne accord, and voluntary inclination, to the thinges which it embraceth, or despiseth: for it doth ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

choose any thing, but that it willeth: nor refuseth any thing, but that it selfe willeth not: finally attempteth nothing at all, but willingly, that is to say of her owne accord, and with a very willing minde.

                  <p>To consent or not to consent <hi>(say they)</hi> is in our own po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, nor is the grace of God otherwise effectuall, but as we embrace hys ayde and assistaunce offered vnto vs.<note place="margin">The obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the Aduersaries.</note> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon they conclude at the length, that it is in our owne power eyther to enterteine, the grace of God, or to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake it.</p>
                  <p>This consequent we deny, as the which beyng made without all forme of art,<note place="margin">The aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere.</note> is also as voyde of all ground of truth.

                     <hi>who doth deny that this grace of God doth finde any good will in vs, but doth make our wills to be good.</hi> And agayne where he testifieth <hi>that no man is able to resort to this grace for ayde, but whose stepps the Lord doth guyde thereunto: in so much that he boldly pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth, that the beginning of Grace is euen to feele a want of grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now therefore followeth vpon these propositions thus graunted, that whersoeuer Gods effectuall grace is,<note place="margin">Wherein effectuall Grace doth consiste.</note> there is no defect of will: on the contrary part, wheresoeuer appeareth any defect of will, there Gods grace is vneffectuall: which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in these ij. operations: namely: in <hi>eternall calling, and inward drawing</hi>: so that the receptacle of grace is within vs in deéde, but not as of our selues: but of the grace of God. But the refusall of grace is both in vs, and withall commeth of our own selues: and yet so neuerthelesse of our owne selues, as that being reiected from Gods grace, we cannot but reiect his grace, nor are we able of our selues to do otherwise, though we would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so fayne.

                  <p>But our good Syr here will deny this. <hi>That God accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng to the inestimable goodnesse of his fatherly nature doth reiect any at any tyme from his mercy, which is indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently and equally layed open for all ingenerall.</hi> Hereof hath bene sufficiently discoursed before. Yet I will adde this one saying. If Gods grace do reiect no person from him, then must we of necessitie confesse that he doth not make choyse of any like wise. For where all are generally and indifferently chosen with out respect, there surely is no man cast away. Agayne where is no reiection at all, there can be then no place for Election. For in choyse we are not sayd to chuse all, but to accept out of all, not euery one, but whom we like best: Where a choyse is, and no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reiected, there is not a choyse or Electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> properly, but an accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce, and an allowaunce rather.

And no meruayle at all. For what may be looked for els, at the handes of so proud a prelate? who beyng enflamed and boyling inwardly (as it were) with such an incredible inordinate desire of luciferlike superioritie: as that he would onely, and alone, rule the roast, and haue all others in subiection vnder hym, how then could such vnmeasurable ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione be possibly satisfied without infinite troubles, vproares, &amp; tumultes?

                  <p>Deale playnly therfore <hi>(Osorius)</hi> and poynt directly to the Butte, that you ought to haue shotte at: Name the person by his name, if ye will be taken for a good Proctour at the Barre: yea if ye be so carefull for the preseruation of the common weale of Christendome (as ye are a curteous and Ciuill Gentleman) let the force of your wrotte eloque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce be blowen directly agaynst those persons, whiche are Enemyes to Christendome in deéde, which treade Empyres vnder foote, which doe writhe and wrest Scepters out of the handes of Princes, which moue commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, styrre vpp y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people agaynst the Nobilitie, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Subiectes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst their Kynges, which do mainteyne the Sonnes in armes agaynst the fathers, which do cause the subiectes to abiure their sworne obedience due to their liege Lords, &amp; teaze and prouoke the rude multitude to bende their force agaynst their naturall Princes, which doe ouerthrow the peace and tranquilitie of the Church of Christ, with their seditious Bulles, open warres, &amp; Ciuill discensions, which do subuert all places of Iustice, Iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall seates and Iudgementes, rende lawes asunder, are truce breakers, and disturbours of peace, are disseysours and disinhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritors of lawfull discentes, proprieties, and possessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: &amp; are pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers and pollers of all co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weales: which do turne all thyngs vpsidowne, choppyng and chaungyng, and makyng a generall

And I would to God there had neuer bene besides there any other poysoned after the same sort.

ioyfully embrace, but yet truely vnder these names lurke many tymes, many crafty conspiracies, I know that it is not vnfitly reported by the Poete. That <hi>Peace</hi> is the most precious pearle of Dame Natures stoare.<note place="margin">Sillius.</note> And surely as euery man excelleth in vertue and pietie, so for the more part is heé studious &amp; care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full most for the due preseruation of <hi>Peace</hi> and of concorde. And therfore good men doe ioue <hi>Peace,</hi> yea and mainteyne <hi>Peace</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest them selues, yet good men onely (good Syr) haue not <hi>Peace</hi> alone. How glorius &amp; acceptable a thyng soeuer <hi>Peace</hi> is accoumpted to be in her owne nature, yea though it be chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly embraced and hadd in greatest price with good men: Yet is not <hi>Peace</hi> alwayes, and altogether conuersaunt amongest good men onely,<note place="margin">Peace is a common thing both to the good and the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.</note> nor the entoyeng of <hi>Peace</hi> alone doth make men to be good. For there is a certeyne <hi>Peace</hi> amongest the wicked: Yea Pirates, Theéues, &amp; Robbers haue their certeine <hi>Peace,</hi> and agreément in willes.

                  <p>And therfore it is not enough to pretend the names &amp; titles of <hi>Peace</hi> and of the <hi>Churche</hi> onely: if their effectes be not aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable. <hi>Peace</hi> (sayth <hi>Hillarie</hi>) <hi>hath a glorious name, and truth is had in great admiratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but who doughteth of this, that the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

On the contrary part, that <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Churche</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer is not grounded vppon the Rocke of Christes infallible truth, is not <hi>Peace,</hi> but Battell rather: is not the Churche of Christ,<note place="margin">Vnder the name of peace many tymes lur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble breach of vnitie.</note> but a conspirary of naughty packes.

After this maner <hi>Tertullus</hi> the Oratour did accuse S.

                  <p>Truly I suppose <hi>(Osorius)</hi> that with the very same wordes and euen in the same maner of outrage, or surely not much vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, <hi>Herode</hi> and the whole Nation of Phariseés did crye out, whenas the fame of Christes byrth being bruted abroad, it was sayd,<note place="margin">Math. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>that Herode the king was exceedingly troubled, and with him all Ierusulem also.</hi> And therfore accordyng to this Logicke, and Rhetoricke of <hi>Osorius.</hi> Let vs condemne Christ him selfe for a seditious fellow: bycause, vnlesse that child had bene borne, and that Sonne had bene geuen vnto vs, those troubles had neuer arisen amongest the Iewes. What shall we say to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>? Where the same Christ afterwardes beyng now of well growe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> yeares, did declare in playne &amp; open wordes, <hi>That he came not to send peace in the earth, but a sword, but diuision, but fire, and that he desired no one thyng more earnestly, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that the same fire should be kinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</hi> Wherfore if it be so much to be feared, least breach of <hi>Peace</hi> and concorde, breéde offence: Let this Portingall aduise him selfe well, whether Christ shalbe here accused as farre forth as <hi>Luther,</hi> bycause in the Gospell he is sayd <hi>to sturre vppe the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther agaynst the Sonne, the daughter agaynst the mother, the step<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother agaynst the daughter inlawe, and the daughter in lawe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst the stepmother, two agaynst three and three ogaynst two:</hi> or whether <hi>Luther</hi> ought to be acquited with Christ, for as much as in this accusation, he can not duely be impeached with any one cryme, which may not also aswell be charged vpon Christ. If the <hi>Peace</hi> of the Catholickes be disturbed in these our dayes through <hi>Luther,</hi> the same also happened to the Phariseés in old tyme, by the meanes of Christ and his Apostles, yea not to the Phariseés onely, but also in sturryng vppe all the Natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the earth in an vproare: wherein yet no fault can be layed vpon Christ, who is himselfe the Prince of <hi>Peace,</hi> and can by no meanes be vnlike him selfe. In lyke maner, and with lyke con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration <hi>Luthers</hi> doctrine is to be deémed (as I suppose). For what a sturre soeuer the Papisticall generation keépe in these

And therefore as touchyng the crime of sedition, and troublesome disturbaunce of <hi>Peace</hi> layed vnto <hi>Luthers</hi> charge, therein the accusation is wrongfully mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourned, and <hi>Luther</hi> iniuriously dealt withall.

                  <p>It is an vndoughted truth that they speake,<note place="margin">Where the Church is, there is the vnity of fayth, but not where vnity is, there the Church is alwayes.</note> and whiche wee also do confesse together with them to witte: that the Churches of Christ, as it is one, and most peacible: so delighteth in nothing more then in <hi>Peace.</hi> But let <hi>Osorius</hi> geue vs such a <hi>Peace,</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der vysor whereof lurketh no conspiracie agaynst the Lord: Let him geue such a <hi>Church</hi> wherein are not fostred Enemies, and traitoures of the true Church.

                  <p>Wherfore it is false and slaunderous which <hi>Osorius</hi> doth conclude vpon the Assertion of Predestination.

But ye will demaund agayne, to what end then was the law published? and naturall choyse set out vnto vs, if that choyce be not free to make choyse of these thinges, that are set forth to our Election? I do aunswere. That this complaynt of <hi>Nature,</hi> might beé not altogether impertinent, if he that gaue the lawes had created the same <hi>Nature,</hi> such, as we haue at this present.

                  <note place="margin">Aunswere.</note>I do aunswere vnto the Maior, two maner of wayes. First: That the same is true in deéde, in those lawes whiche were esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished of the Lawgeuer, to this onely ende, that the subiectes should exactly performe the same. But albeit GOD did desire this thyng chiefly, that all men should precisely and throughly obserue his Ordinaunces, yet besides this consideration, there are many other endes and causes.<note place="margin">The vse &amp; end of the law.</note> 1. That the Iudgement and wrath of God agaynst Sinne should be made manifest. 2. That we might be more easily brought to the acknowledgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of our Sinnes and weakenesse. 3. Thyrdly, that vnderstandyng our weakenes the more we feéle our selues more heauyly oppressed with this burden, the more sharpely we should be prouoked (as with the Schoolemaisters rodde) to fleé vnto Christ, who is the end of the law. 4. That by this Schoolyng, as it were, we may learne what way we ought to take, that if it be not geuen vs at the least to atteyne the full, and absolute obedience of the law, yet that begynnyng to be obedient, we may profitte as much as we may.</p>
               <p>Secundaryly we do confesse, that the Maior is true in res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of those lawes, for the due obseruation of the which, there is no cause to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary, either by the Lawgeuer, or in nature it selfe, but such as appeareth rather in the Subiectes: Whose onely fault, and disorderous licentiousnes procureth the breach
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:3766:250"/>
therof. As for example. If a Prince do sende foorth an Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadour in all respectes whole, sounde, and well enstructed, to whom afterwardes he geueth in commaundement to put some matter in execution, which he might very easily bryng to passe vnlesse through his owne default, and disorder he made him selfe lame, halte, or vnable to execute the commaundement of his Prince. Now, if this Ambassadour for want of health, and stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth become vnable to execute his Embassie, ought y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prince to be blamed for it? or the Ambassadour rather, who by his owne folly hath disabled him selfe? And that is it that <hi>Augustine</hi> doth seéme to emply in his booke <hi>De perfectione Iustit.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">August. de perfect. Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stit.</note> 
                  <hi>Nay rather for this cause</hi> (sayth he) <hi>the man is blameworthy, that he can not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fittly doe his duetie, nor liue without Sinne: bycause by mans owne will it came to passe, that hee should be driuen to that Necessitie, which could not afterwardes be shaken of agayne by ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s will alone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thyrdly here is to be noted, that there be foure maner of meanes or wayes to obserue the law. 1. Either by the force of our owne strength: and by this meanes the greatnesse of our strength is ouercome by the law. 2. Or by the helpe of some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: And so nothyng withstandeth, but that we may fulfill the commaundementes of the law. 3. Or by the operation of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost in vs, to make vs to lyue godly. 4.

All which were farre otherwise in God. For first, who euer limited any lawes for God which he might not breake? Wherfore beyng Freé from all law, he neither did any thyng here, nor at any tyme els can doe any thyng, that is not in all respectes, most lawfull for him to doe.

               <p>We Read lykewise in the holy Scriptures. <hi>It is necessary that offences shall come, it is necessary that heresies be. &amp;c.</hi> And it is not to be doughted, but that this Necessitie doth issue fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ordinaunce of God. And what then? if these offences do chaunce altogether besides the ordinaunce of GOD how then doe they chaunce of Necessitie? Agayne if they happen by the ordinau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of GOD, how shall we then defende the goodnesse of GOD?

What the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? shall we therefore accuse God as Author of the wickednesse of the vngodly? because these thinges chaunce of Necessitie, which God hath purposed shall come to passe, and can by no meanes be altered? For so seemeth <hi>Osori.</hi> to conclude hys argument. But I argue agaynst hym in this wise, and with two reasons. First. If this preordinaunce of God, whereof I speake, do bryng such a Necessitie of externall coaction vppon men, as <hi>Osorius</hi> doth speake of, as that no man could sinne voluntaryly but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pelled
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:3766:263"/>
thereunto by God: it might not seeme altogether perhaps from the purpose, to impute the fault thereof to God. But what is he now? or what ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath euer bene so horribly wicked at any time? who in performing his treacherous deuises, can say that he was constrayned agaynst hys will to commit the facte, that he would not haue done, being neyther led thereunto of any motion of him selfe, nor blynded with any hys owne affections?</p>
               <p>Moreouer although the will of God doth work together with mans will:<note place="margin">Aug. de grat. &amp; lib. arb. Cap. 21.</note> or (as <hi>Augustine</hi> liked rather to speake) whether God do worke in the hartes of men to apply their willes wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto it pleaseth hym, eyther to godlines for hys good mercies sake, or to wickednes and vyce according to their owne deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinges: or whether man be afflicted with any crosse of persequu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet doth God bring all these to passe, according to his own iust Iudgement, sometimes open and manifest, but alwayes most righteous: for what sitteth more with iustice, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to punish offenders? then to tame and suppresse the outragious pryde of rebellious Nature? But forasmuch as all the workes of GOD are directed chiefly as to one ende: from whence then may man take a more large occasion, to magnifie and extoll the Iustice of God, then out of hys owne works? And therefore though weé confesse, that it is one selfe work which is wrought by God, and by man, yet because in the selfe same worke God worketh by an other way, and to an other ende: Namely putting in vre the worke of hys Iustice: and because men do the workes of pryde, of Luste, of wrath, and of couetousnes: hereupon it commeth to passe, that sinne is worthely imputed vnto them: the will of God remayning alwayes righteous and good notwithstanding. For this rule is to be holden alwayes vnshaken: That all the works of God are wrought for the best. So the fall of our first parent <hi>Adam,</hi> the hardening of <hi>Pharaoes</hi> hart, the treaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Iudas,</hi> the persequutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Paule,</hi> tended to as good purpose as the perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraunce of <hi>Noah</hi> in fayth: The humblenes of <hi>Dauid, Peters</hi> denyall of hys maister, and the conuersion of <hi>Paule.</hi> For what soeuer is wrought by God, doth alwayes tourne to the glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of hys power, and magnifieng hys Iustice: of hys <hi>Iustice,</hi> because by sinne he doth punish sinne: and that most righteously: of hys <hi>power,</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with hys mighty hand, and onstretched arme
<pb facs="tcp:3766:264"/>
he doth aduaunce and deliuer them for his wonderfull mercies, sake, and of hys free liberalitie it pleaseth hym to vouchsaue. But <hi>Osorius</hi> is a wylypye, and will not be destitute of a star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting hoale, but will seéke to escape through some chynk or mous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoole. And because he doth perceaue, that Gods power ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be vtterly sequestred from the Actions of men, he like an olde try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed shifter, will collour the matter, and applye the workes of God which we haue rehearsed, to Gods foreknowledge. For this is the subtill distinction whereunto our aduersaryes flee for their defence.</p>

                  <note place="margin">How the aduersaries do dally with Gods prouidence.</note>They say that no prouidence of God that may enduce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Necessitie,</hi> doth go before to cause men to sinne. Onely that God did foreknow that they would so do, &amp; that they were such in deed: not for that God did foreknow, that they would be such: but rather that he did therefore foreknowe that they should be such through their own inclination.</p>
               <p>Where the Aduersaryes make mencion of the foreknowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God,<note place="margin">Aunswere.</note> they doe not altogether lye in this poynte. For it is most true, that the Maiestye of God doth behold (as it were) with present view all thinges that are, haue bene, and shalbe, as though they were present in hys eye: but herein they go amisse, where they practize to establish the foreknowledge and permissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God so firmely, that they would haue hys vnchaungeable prouidence seuered from the same: which cannot possibly be by any meanes: for what may a man thinke, if God doe foreknow and permitte wickednes to raigne, which he is not able to turne away, where is then hys power? if he be able and will not, where is then his mercy? what father is so hard harted, that seéing his childe ready to receaue some harme, will not call him from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill if he may? But say they, he that doth wickedly, &amp; he also that doth consent thereunto, are both in one predicament. Therfore as it is an absurde thing not to confesse God to be omnipotent, or that any thing is done that he cannot do: so is that as false also to say, that any thing w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God will not, is permitted w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out hys knowledge, and agaynst hys will. For howe shall we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue that God doth permitte any thing to be done, but because hys will is, that it shall so be done? whereupon we may frame an argument agaynst those persones, who reiecting the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary

creation, presuming to attayne the knowledge of good and euil: then came it to passe by the most iuste iudgement of God, not by hys <hi>Permission</hi> but by hys prouidence also, that Freewill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng as then throughly furnished with vnderstanding, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son (but destitute of Grace) could not gouerne it selfe, but must needes both agaynst hys owne knowledge, and conscience stum<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble, and fall downe withall. And no meruayle. For assoone as God had withdrawne hys light, right spirite, and helping hand (whereupon issued lacke of well doyng, blindenes and hardnes of hart) it could not otherwise be, but that (the grace of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing withdrawne &amp; all abillitie to do well beyng taken away) this proud presumptuous Uermine must fall to the ground, both of very Iustice and of very Necessitye, whereof the one is ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to God, and not to man, this other not to God but to man, and to hys owne Freewill: And hereupon aryseth that absolute and vnauoydeable Necessitie whereof we treat so much, and withall the most iust defence of Gods Iustice.</p>
               <p>Then besides this Freewill, there is yet an other reason,<note place="margin">The second reason.</note> that will playnly acquite the iust prouidence of God from fault, though it worke in the sinnes of men together with men them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. As when he bryngeth vppon man eyther diseases of the body, or blindnes of vnderstanding for sinnes already commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, punishing sinne: as it were, by sinne Euen so <hi>Pharao,</hi> that had vsed horrible tyranny before in drowning y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> suckling babes of the Hebrues, was himselfe afterwardes most iustly hard har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God, and at the last miserably drowned in the read Sea.

                  <hi>As they would not geue themselues to know God, God did deliuer them ouer to the lustes of their owne hartes. &amp;c.</hi> And in an other place writing to the Thes. <hi>For this cause</hi> (sayth he) <hi>God will send vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> strong illusion to beleue lyes &amp;c.</hi>

And yet is there no cause in the meane whiles, why any man should complayne that the thynges are done iniuriously which are done by Gods secrete Iudgement: or that God ought to be blamed in any of all these, whenas whatsoeuer is done by him, we beleue assuredly, is done either to expresse his power, or to make his glory discernable, or to commend his Iustice, or els to discouer the wonderfull riches of his mercy.</p>
               <p>Wherfore when <hi>Luther</hi> doth affirme, that with GOD all thynges are done by an absolute Necessitie, whether they come by destiny, chaunce, or any fortune at all, why should not it be as lawfull for him to speake so, as for <hi>Osorius</hi> to speake in the lyke phrase and in lyke titles of words.

the good workes, whiche he did forsee to be in them, and condemne the other lykewise for their euill doynges. For otherwise if he doe not regarde the workes, then were not his Iustice constaunt and permanent.</p>

               <p>First I do aunswere out of <hi>Augustine</hi>:<note place="margin">Aunswere.</note> that it is a most pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilent errour, to say, that the Grace of God is distributed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng to merites; &amp; this is one of the errours of <hi>Pelagius.</hi> Then as touchyng the Maior. There is in deéde with God a perfect, sounde, &amp; vnchaungeable Reason of all his workes: <hi>But by what reason be ordereth his workes, may not be subiect to the Iudgement of the claye</hi> (as <hi>Augustine</hi> sayth) <hi>but of the Potter.</hi> Now I come to the Minor. Which we do vtterly deny: for where you make a definition of Gods prouidence (in <hi>chusing</hi> or <hi>refusing</hi> whom he will) to be none other then such as dependeth vpon the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge of workes: this is altogether most brutishe and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable. For albeit that preue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting for eknowledge of things (which out Deuines doe call foreknowledge) is vnseparably knitte together to the will of him, that doth Predestinate: yet do we not graunt the same to be the cause of Predestination. For first as concernyng the cause efficient, for as much as the will of God is the very substaunce of God, aboue the which there ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be nothyng more highe: there can be no efficient cause thereof ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, either before it, in limitation of tyme: or aboue it in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie: but the materiall and finall cause therof may (after a sort) be assigned. The materiall cause about the which it doth exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise her force, is ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kynde, and those thynges which God doth geue vnto men by Predestination, namely: <hi>Vocation, Faith, Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification, Glorification</hi>: The finall cause is two maner of wayes: either that which forceth him to doyng, by the preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng will and reason of the first Agent: or els that which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced out of action. And bycause there may be many endes of one thyng, it may be, that there is one end of Predestination, an other end of him that is Predestinated, and an other of him that doth Predestinate: As for exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple: As Saluation and life euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastyng is the end of Predestination: the end of him that is Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destinated, is to beleue and to lyue well: and the end of him that doth Predestinate, is his owne glory, and the manifestation of
<pb facs="tcp:3766:270"/>
his Iustice, power and mercy. As we do reade in Salomons Prouerbes.<note place="margin">Prouer. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>God doth make all thinges for himselfe, and the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked man also for the euill day.</hi> And therfore if it be asked, whether God do predestinate for the workes sake?<note place="margin">Not for good wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes. To good workes.</note> it may be aunswered with S. <hi>Paule,</hi> that the holy ones are predestinated not for their good workes, but to do good workes: so that now the respect of workes be vnderstanded, not to be the cause efficient of prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stination: but the effect rather. For thus we heare the Apostle speake,<note place="margin">Ephes. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Euen as God hath chosen vs in hys sonne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eternitie that we should become holy to the prayse of hys glory. &amp;c.</hi> not because we were, or should be holy (sayth he) but that <hi>we should become holy, to the prayse of hys glory, &amp;c.</hi> So that no reason of <hi>Election</hi> may appeare, but that which is to be sought for in the freé libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of hym, that doth make the <hi>Election,</hi> neyther that any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther last end may be conceaued, but the prayse of the manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of hys heauenly grace.

Whereby you may playn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceaue, that all these councells and workes of God (which we do see) were begonne, and atchieued, not for any fayth fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seene before, nor for any foreknowne good works, but to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, and make discernable hys power, and the prayse of hys grace. And yet is not this vntrue, that the fayth of the holy ones was foreseene, and the works of the vngodly were foreknowne, long before they were: but yet these do follow as effectes, and do not preuent, nor make predestination, nor do certifie a reason, or playne demonstracion of Gods prouidence, but are the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues established rather, by the reason of Gods prouidence: For to hym that will enquire amongest all the workes of God, what is it, that his most hyest and vnsearcheable will hath respect vnto chiefly? for what reason: for what cause? and to what end all these were instituted, in the same order and maner, as we do beholde them? the matter may by this reason, be made notorious vnto hym: <hi>to make manifest</hi> (sayth he) <hi>the power of hys wrathe, and to make knowne the riches of hys mercy.</hi> But I will pursue the other reasons, wherewith they do vrge vpon vs.</p>

               <p>And therfore, to conclude briefly. For asmuch as all the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Predestination doth tend to this ende chiefly: that men may be forewarned not to trust to much to their owne strength, but to repose all their hope and affiaunce in God, It is vntrue that you do obiect: <hi>That the doctrine of predestination doth perswade rather to desperation then to godly lyfe: For what is this els as Augustine sayth, then as that you should say, that men do then dispayre of their owne safety, when they beginne to learne to repose their hope and affiaunce in God, and not in themselues in any wise. &amp;c,</hi> Whosoeuer therefore shall instruct the ignoraunt people, in the true doctrine of predestination of the holy ones, discretly, and modestly and in due season, when case so requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth: and shall ioyne withall godly and wholesome exhortations, the same shall he do profitably enough without anye inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb facs="tcp:3766:273"/>
seeing that the preaching of both may be well coupled, and agree together, according to the testimony of Augustine: who affirmeth: that neyther the preaching of fayth <hi>profiting in godly fruits ought to be hindered by the preaching of predestination, that they which are taught may learue how to obey:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aug. de bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no, perseue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra. Cap. 17.</note> And agayne <hi>that the preachi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g of Predestinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ought not to be hindered by the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of fayth profiting in godly fruites, that they which obey, may know, in whom they ought to reioyce, not in thoir owne obedience, but in him of whom it is written:</hi> he that doth reioyce let him reioyce in the Lord.</p>
               <p>Will you vnderstand, <hi>Osorius</hi> how the coupling of these too doctrines is not preiudiciall to the preaching of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Paule the Apostle of the Gentills did many tymes sette forth the doctrine of predestination to the Rom. Ephe. Timot. The same did Luke in the Actes of the Apostles. Christ himself likewise doth make often mencion of the same in hys sermons: all which did not cease to preach the word of God neuerthelesse and do notwithstanding withal entermixt diuers good and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exhortations to liue well.</p>
               <p>Paule when he sayd: <hi>it is God that doth worke in vs to will and to bring to passe according to hys good pleasure:</hi> did he therefore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate any thing of hys godly lessons to make vs lesse carefull to will? and to worke the thinges, that are acceptable vnto God?

as God is of his owne nature most best and most perfect, hereu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon it commeth to passe, that he which hath ordeined all thynges for him selfe, can in no respect be the cause of euill. 2.

But yet to admit that the actions of mans lyfe, are not gouerned without the prouident and circumspect direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods will: and that it is he alone, that inclineth mens willes whither him listeth: Yet neuerthelesse euen he, that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth the willes, hath enclosed also the same willes within cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne limittes and lawes, and as it were enuironed them, with certeine hedges &amp; bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, which whether we accomplish or no, seyng he hath made the will of God manifestly discernable vnto vs, certeinly they do not onely sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly acquite, and cleare his Iustice, but also aboundantly commende the same. 4.

                  <hi>Carolosta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi> began to plucke downe Images, and to make an innoua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in many thynges: the matter beyng duely wayed, was of it selfe commendable enough: yet bycause he attempted it with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence and vprore (the Magistrate not beyng made priuy vnto it) I withstoode him. The lyke attempt was made by <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> and <hi>Oecolampadius,</hi> about the matter of the Sacrament. I doe not here debate of the truth of the cause: And yet no one thyng restrayned me so much from subscribyng to their Asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as did the dought of broyles, which I feared would after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes haue ensued. I will adde also somewhat of my selfe: when the Counsell was called at <hi>Wormes,</hi> beyng cited by pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blique authoritie to appeare before the Emperiall seate: I dyd not refuse. Certainly the daunger was assured and apparaunt.

If I had bene of so lewde a disposition, &amp; so foreward to sedition, as you suspect <hi>(Osorius)</hi> there wanted not at that tyme, both Princes, frendshyp and fautoures of the cause: yea and perhappes there was tyme good enough to put it in practize. But was there euer any Prince, or Subiect encouraged (by my meanes) to moue discension? This beyng done not long after in deéde, the Boores of the Countrey began to raunge in that outrage (whom after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes <hi>Muncer</hi> and <hi>Phyfer</hi> takyng partes withall) brake out into lyke maddnesse. The common weale beyng thus deuided, &amp; disquieted, how greatly I was greéued withall, what meanes I vsed agaynst them accordyng to my duety, what aunswere I made to their Articles, with what reasons I refuted them, what counsell I gaue and what exhortations to commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> quyet, and Christian obedience, myne owne writynges (extaunt as yet) doe testifie for me, and the Hystories therof doe sufficiently declare.

                  <note place="margin">The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playnt of the Boores against Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther framed by Osorius by a Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall fictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note>And why so? <hi>We</hi> (sayth he) <hi>haue learned of you that we are not able of our selues to doe good or euill.</hi> And what then? <hi>Hereof we conceaued our foolehardynesse, this was the cause that moued vs Boores to Armes.</hi> O notable Argument co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded by clownes, but very clownish surely.

But if you will take occasion to argue agaynst me, of that which you might haue learned out of my writyngs (O ye Boores) ye were in them enstructed after this maner: That Magistrates ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced: why did you not obey this lesson? How often did I teach you that Rebellion must be eschued by all meanes possible? that no priuate man should auenge his owne iniuries? that it was not lawfull for any Christian to auenge any priuate wrong? That Christ had no neéde of any warlyke guarrison? That the Maiestie of the Gospell was able and strong enough of it selfe to mainteyne her owne quarell? That there could be no more forcible victory for the truth and pure doctrine, then which is atchieued with sufferaunce, and patience? that the nature of the same was such, as the more it were pursued, the more forcibly
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:3766:276"/>
it would preuayle? Why learned ye not to follow these lessons? Lastly: when ye were in Armes, and dereygned in field, and by sound of Trumpet had published your Articles, and Requestes to the hygher powers, how much dyd I moyle and turmoyle my selfe, to reduce you to order, and reclayme you from your at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptes? teachyng you out of holy Scriptures, conuincyng you, aduertizyng you, chidyng, beseéchyng, perswadyng, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng, finally omittyng no part of duety vntouched, whereby I might reclayme you from your hurly burly, to peace and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillitie. If so be that my doctrine were of such authoritie with you, why did you shut vppe your eares from your Masters les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sones? If you betooke your selues to Armes, through occasion of one sentence wrongfully vnderstoode, or misconstrued, why dyd ye not forsake the field, for so many my exhortatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table exclamations to the contrary.</p>
               <p>But go to <hi>Osorius</hi>: bycause vnder the person of the Boores complaynte, you do so vehemently wrest all this false suggestion of mischief agaynst me. What if I deny your <hi>Assumpsit?</hi> how will you be able to proue it? perhappes by heare say amongest the clownes? what? of any that be liuyng? or that be dead? But when the poore clownes lyued, and were drawen to execution, tormented, and stretched out vpon the rackes (in which extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie men are wont for the more part to vtter more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they know) If there were one so much of that whole rable, muttered euer halfe a sillable of me, such as your Carterlyke and senselesse I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination hath deuised agaynst me, I will willyngly yeld to this accusation of suspitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. <hi>But by your occasion</hi> (say you) <hi>this tumult might haue bene raysed easily.</hi> So might the Blacke Moore chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge his skinne.

were the whole seédeplotte of all this Rebellion? what shall we say the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to that, which we read in Paul? <hi>That it is God that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth all in all:</hi>

And yet this is the generall proclamation of that notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Seé of Rome, dispersed throughout all Catholicke Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: the same doe all their Recordes and Canons noyse abroad (wheresoeuer they crawle) yea many yeares before <hi>Luther</hi> was borne: and the very same also doth <hi>Osorius</hi> write at this day in Portingall, and many other of the lyke fraternitie elles where: what? was there neuer any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>motions therfore of the rude mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude (before <hi>Luther</hi> was borne) in Portingall? none in Italy?

By this reason, away with the Bible, bycause out of the same, the most parte of heretiques haue sucked their poyson: what? dyd not Paule therfore not commende the Iustice of God aright by our vnrighteousnesse, bycause there wanted not that would abuse his saying to occasion of euill? <hi>Let vs doe euill</hi> (say they) <hi>that good may come thereby.</hi> The auncient godly Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were wont to assemble together, and sing Psalmes before day light and to receaue the Sacrament of bread &amp; wyne.

vpon whose shauen sconse not so much as a herebreadth may be founde growing of an honest or sober man, ye would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer haue so filthyly infamed the good reporte and credite of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest personages, standyng in the defence of the Gospell, with so many slaunderous lyes, and cursed reproches.

For otherwise as concerning that exquisite excellency of Eloquence, for asmuch as neyther <hi>Cicero,</hi> that graund captayne of Eloquence himselfe, doth at all times speak so exquisitely: neither forceth so much if it be not altogether ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiall in a Philosopher, so that his maners and doctrine be substanciall: what cause is there to the contrary,<note place="margin">Exquisite eloquence as is not carefully required in philosipher so may the want therof be borne withall in a Deuine.</note> but if there be some defect thereof in a deuine, that he may as well beé borne withall, so that the simplicitie of hys speach agree with the truth, and be cleare from barbarous grossenesse: and so that the want of Eloquence, be supplyed with the soundnes of the truth.

               <p>But yet truely whereunto soeuer <hi>Haddon</hi> is fitte or vnfitte, or whatsoeuer <hi>Haddon</hi> can do or cannot do: This is most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne and true.

               <p>Aud therefore as concerning the Grace and dexteritie of <hi>Cicero</hi>: whatsoeuer it be that eyther. Nature did emplant in him, or Industry did attayne: as I despise it not, but rather very well like of it, and do wonder at so excellent a gift of God in him: so agayne do I not reprehend in any man to immitate him, so that his imitation be ioyned with Christian simplicitie, so that it be done not to hawke after the proud estimation of the worlde, nor to the vayne glorious ostentation of witte, nor for anye pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate glory: finally so that it be so applyed, that discret imitation may be clearely voyde of vayne affectation. Nowe what shall we say to them? who reiecting all other teachers of maners and doctrine, do employ all their endeuour to file vpp their tongues &amp; so addict themselues altogether to <hi>Cicero</hi> alone, and so ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zedly dote vpon him onely, that thinke it a lesse fault not to be a Christian almost, then not to be a <hi>Ciceronian</hi>: nor iudge hym scarse worthy the reading (though he be neuer so Christian a wryter) that doth not frame hys stile after <hi>Ciceroes,</hi> patterne, and sauor altogether of hys delicate speache? And that is the cause (as I suppose) why <hi>Osorius</hi> doth recken, that <hi>Haddon</hi> doth wryte nothing purely, and nothing playnly. Not because he hath corruptly or fasly written, but that it seémeth to <hi>Osori.</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he hath not written like a <hi>Ciceronian,</hi> &amp; because hee doth not throughly resemble his dexteritie &amp; loftines, although in deéde

a fewe sparckles onely except. Likewise also throughout the whole course of the rest of your discourse, how often haue your friuolous, and confused Argumentes moued me to myrth, and laughter? As where you thrust your selfe to stoughtly into the matter of <hi>Iustification</hi> &amp; <hi>Predestination</hi>: in all which kinde of doctrine notw<hi rend="sup">t</hi>sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dyng you seéme as meére a strau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger, as though you came new fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>But this ridiculous <hi>Silenus</hi> doth neuer play his part more pleasauntly, then whenas takyng the rodde in his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, and sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng in the Schoolemaisters chayre, he calleth forth poore seély <hi>Haddon</hi> into the middes of the Schoole, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeth him to harken to him, &amp; to learne of his Maister.

Wherfore keépe these Maisterly preceptes now to your selfe, which you may then at the length with shame enough lay vpon others neckes, when you haue your selfe lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to vse them well before.

               <p>And therfore I doe not differre much from his Iudgement herein, who although attributed enough vnto <hi>Cicero,</hi> yet did so much of set purpose absteine fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> affectation of his speache, that although he could haue attayned thereunto, gaue him selfe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet to a more sou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de, more proportionable, more pitthy, lesse effeminate, more naturall, lesse fleshly, &amp; a more spirituall kynde of speache.

What Iudgementes of others you presse vs withall, I know not: but if they be <hi>Ciceronians,</hi> I doe not greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard them: If they be blinde, and like vnto your selfe, such I can not tearme to be Iudgementes, but foreiudgementes ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, such as are wont to be of those, whose Iudgementes are not grounded vpon reason, but vpon affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. <hi>Ierome</hi> in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine place doth say, <hi>that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

First he maketh promise to set downe certeine signes, and tokens, by the which he will make manifest the difference betwixt true Relligion, and false, and betwixt true Prophetes, and false. Afterwardes annexing a description of his Church he doth display the same abroad very curiously in the maner of a very fayre and beautyfull picture, painted out (as it were) in a Table to be viewed. Next vnto this he maketh a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parison betwixt the two Churches: so magnifieng his owne Church with wonderfull prayses and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendations, that it is not possible to aduaunce it more highly: &amp; agaynst so embasing &amp; thrustyng downe vnder foote the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And first of all commeth to hand an infringible Argument of <hi>Osorius,</hi> now once agayne repeated out of his letters writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to Queéne <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> Which bycause he braggeth was not confuted by <hi>Haddon,</hi> so much the more behoueth vs to note ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisedly, his wonderfull skill vttered in knittyng vppe the knotte therof: So that if we be no more able to vnlose it, then <hi>Haddon</hi> was, we should at least stand maruelously amazed at the inscru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ingeniousnes of the man: For determinyng with him selfe to make a playne demonstration, that these new Gospellers (as he calleth them) should not in any wise be harkened vnto, but should be banished out of all common weales, as common pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, and maisters of all misrule and wickednesse: he frameth his Argument vpon this pointe:<note place="margin">Osori.

of this people: neither yet though it were true, that it is preiudiciall to the defence of the cause now in hand. For the controuersie here doth concerne properly matters of Relligion: to the which if the conuersations of the professours were not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>responde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: or if the séedes of Christes Gospell did not fall vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fruitefullest grounde altogether, but were choaked vppe with thornes: or that the Corne were ouergrowen with Cockell and Tares: the fault therof was not in the word, but in the people. For humane actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s had neuer so good successe in this world, but that the greater sorte were alwayes delighted with the worst: and the worst part many tymes preuayled beyond the best. And that this came to passe long sithence, not onely in the tyme of Christ and his Apostles, but in the age of the holy Martyrs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, and doth likewise happen by a certeine continuall order and enterchaunged course of the world, dayly and hourely, so that not onely the Preachers of the word, but the Church of Rome it selfe, neuer wanteth matter sufficient of great &amp; greéuous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaintes. And albeit (as the maners of men are) through the ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerd peéuishnes of wayward frowardes the most sacred word of God be euill spoken of amongest the Paganes, and Infidelles, yet, if the matter be debated amongest wise, and discrete perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages, it will not be thought matter reasonable, that the thyngs which of their own nature are good, should be called in question, and condemned for the naughty behauiour of naughty packes abusing the same. And therfore that <hi>Osor.</hi> did amisse herein, to wrest the whole state of the question to maners, and euill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation, which did onely concerne matter of Relligion: More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer also, though neuer so straight Inquisitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were made of the life, and maners of the professours of the worde: yet behoued not <hi>Osorius</hi> to bende him selfe so sharpely agaynst our Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, with any accusation, before he had throughly acquited, or at least wise aunswered the griefes and complaintes of many others of his own Catholickes, which are much more haynous and worthy of speédy reformation.</p>
            <p>To these reasons of <hi>Haddon</hi> let vs heare what <hi>Osorius</hi> doth (I say not) dispute, but with open mouth cry out: first he vaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and triumpheth that his argument is not resolued: After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes this gallant glorious <hi>Thraso</hi> doth meruaile very much

            <p>Now ensueth the Minor of this Sillogisme. <hi>But Luther Melancton. Zuinglius, Bucer, and Caluine, which took vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this charge, yet reaped no fruit agayn of innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy of lyfe, nor of Charitie from amongst them that they were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaunt withall. &amp;c.</hi> First I would fayne learne, what it was, that these men did take vpon them to doe: To call backe the life, and most corrupt maners of men of that age to the perfect rule of the Gospell? Truely they vndertooke a very hard charge, farr exceeding all humayne power and abilitie. Go to, and where did <hi>Luther, Zuinglius,</hi> or any of the rest, make any such promise of themselues by word, or sillable of word, so much at any time? Surely I haue perused many of their works: yet could I neuer
<pb facs="tcp:3766:289"/>
finde any such thing hitherto. If you haue glaunced vpon anye such thing by chaunce, why do you not set down the place openly that the reader may perceaue, that you deale not with forged lyes, but with good matter: not of any desire to cauill, but of an vpright Iudgement: not coldly and lyengly, but simply and playnely: not keeping a Iangling with vnsauory speaches and forged vntruthes (which many men do blame you for) but so and in such wise, as you may seeme to haue made plaine demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of a true and iust reporte, with as true and vpright a minde, to haue the truth knowne by true proues and testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies: and not to mock and delude men with fables. Surely it were to be wished of all good men, that all Christians by profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and name, would by all meanes possible leade their lyues truely Christianlike, in all poyntes agreable with the doctrine which they professe. And it is not to be doughted, but that these new Gospellers, as you call them, did wishe this with all theyr hartes, if wishing could haue auayled. But to bryng the same to passe, as was neuer in their power, so did they neuer enter into any such couenaunt, nor euer obliged themselues by any promise priuy or aperte, that they would accomplishe the same: Wherin how much you were not only deceaued in <hi>Luther,</hi> but how much ye speake also against your self, do ye but coniecture hereby. For whereas <hi>Luther</hi> did professe, that the substaunce of mans sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation did consist not in the life, &amp; maners of men, but in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> onely fayth of the Sonne of God: how doth this agree together, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he (whom a little earst you accused to be the subuertour of all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest accions, and vertuous endeuour) should nowe take vpon him to stoare and enriche the lyues and conuersacions of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, with aboundance of vertuous plantes and seedes of godlines? Albeit there neuer lacked in them a certayne Godly carefullnesse to exhort to all honest endeuours, yet were they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so franticke, as to make so glorious bragges of reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of lyfe. They trauelled earnestly, euery one according to his abilitie, as beseémed godly and well disposed personages, if not as much as they could haue wished, yet as much as was geuen them by the holy ghost. And if they attayned nought els, yet this they atchieued surely, that though they coulde not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pure simplicitie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gelicall life, yet they brought to
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:3766:289"/>
passe that men by reading and comparing the holy scriptures, beganne to haue a very euident feeling, and a thorough taste of the corrupt and stincking matter of your absurde and filthy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitious doctrine: the durty puddle wherof, albeit they mistrusted that they should not be able to clense throughly, for the vnmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surable tyranny of your aucthoritie, and power: Yet thought they not conuenient for the credite, and function that they bare, to suffer the same to be any longer cloaked and dissembled w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>all.</p>
            <p>And therefore stept forth amongst the rest <hi>Martine Luther,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Luther.</note> and yet he was neyther the first, nor yet so long agoe, neyther so much of his owne voluntary will, as necessarily of relieng duety, not for hope of lucre, ne yet to pamper vp the paunch (as <hi>Hosius</hi> belieth him) neyther of any hope at all to purchase any authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (as <hi>Osorius</hi> mistaketh him) but forced thereunto by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunacy of others, yea and that not without manifest perill of his lyfe. Whereupon if any thinge chaunced afterwardes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to your expectations, ye can iustly accuse no man, but your selues: which were the first authors of this flaming Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con, the heate whereof doth parch the very skinnes of your backes. And what the very cause and occasion thereof was, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are the histories so obscure, but that they tell playnly, nor is the tyme so farre spent: but you may easily call to minde the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry time, and season, whenas <hi>Leo</hi> the Pope of Rome, sending abroad hys commissioners of receipt, and pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting his treasories throughout all the Dominions of Europe, appoynted a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall marte (as it were) of raking hys Marchandize together: Whereupon diuers holy cloyster Marchauntes arriued into Germany, And amongst them a certayne Fryer of S.

Which proclamation seeming not a little iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to the people, and tending to the ouerthrow of the Gospell of grace, and mouing godly consciences to no small griefe, and displeasaunce of mynde, and that not without iust cause: <hi>Luther</hi> a man continually exercized with inward agonyes, and vnquiet

               </gap>ilence. Albeit he was well assured, that this stincking and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious weed could not be touched without present perill of life. Wherefore he beganne to make a show of himselfe, meaning to defend y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> quarrell of the Gospell but by a very sle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der &amp; slight at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt as it were. And first he propoundeth certayn propositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s onely, and principles of questions agaynst these gainefull mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ketts of pardons, and Bulles, not of any vayne desire to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contend, or dispute, nor without an humble maner of submission of the cause: thincking nothing lesse, then that the successe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of would be such as we now see is come to passe. If the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part had with like moderation tempered their affections, and eyther co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented themselues by saying nothing, to haue yeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the truth, or to haue sought the aduauncement of Christs glory, rather then to haue serued the Popes pompe and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: these smale sparckles had neuer burst out into so great flames. But now by the meanes of their owne waywardnes, it came to passe in them, as for the more part it falleth out with common brabblers, who hauing many tymes the worst ende of the staffe, and hauing no right in deéde to any part thereof, striue so long, till at the last they lose euery inche thereof, and at the shutting vppe, catch a rappe for their labour.</p>
            <p>Agaynst these propositions of <hi>Pardones, Tetcelius</hi> vnmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surably ragyng, not contented with no lesse intollerable arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancie and insolency to aunswere them him selfe, but sturred vp agaynst <hi>Luther</hi> a neast of <hi>Dominicke</hi> hornettes: caused his propositions, and Assertion of <hi>Pardones</hi> to be openly burned: framed Articles agaynst the man, &amp; exclamed with open mouth agaynst him, that he ought to be burnt like an hereticke. And bycause the Popes power should not be destitute of frendes, in a matter of so great importaunce, immediately started vp one <hi>Prierias</hi> the Prouost of the Friers, who like a Lordlike fellow challengeth <hi>Luther</hi> into the field.

            <p>
               <hi>Luther</hi> beyng thus vexed through y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> madd outrage of these Friers, was driuen to this issue, that of necessitie he must prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute his propositions with a more large and ample discourse: &amp; so sent the same to <hi>Leo</hi> then Pope of Rome, with Letters em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portyng his humble submission: most humbly beseéchyng, that he would not geue credite to the slaunderous reportes of his aduersaries,<note place="margin">Luthers humble let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to pope Leo the tenth.</note> alledgyng for his excuse that he published his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions touchyng Pardons, not of any euill will or malice to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his grace, but onely by way of disputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wherof he hath now treated more at large, and therfore would most humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seéch him to vouchsaue benyngly to read, and accept it: As tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyng his owne person, he was so affected towardes that Seé, that he would willingly submit to the authoritie therof not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his writings, but his sauetie and life also withall, in all humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie and lowlynesse: and whatsoeuer his Maiestie should deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine thereupon, he would no lesse reuerently esteéme of, then as a decreé of the chief Uicare of Christ, vnto whom he did acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge all obedience due in earth next vnder Christ. In this so humble &amp; lowly submission of this prostrate person, in so weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie a matter, and in so wholesome counsell, what this Uicare of Christ did, and how this heyre and Successour of S.

            <p>Euen such were the begynnynges of this troublesome tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest, which ganne spread it selfe abroad in euery coast, Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you may easily vnderstand (I suppose) that <hi>Luther</hi> thought vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nothyng lesse at the first, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to heare of any innouatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of customes or ceremonies: but enduced partly through the necessitie of the matter, partly by the prouocation of some peéuishe waywardes, did onely set downe a few propositions: wherein he gaue no attempt agaynst the state of the Romishe Seé, neither did as yet vtterly abandone all Pardons &amp; Bulles, but required onely a moderation to be vsed in them. And it was not to be doughted, but if the vnsatiable greédynesse, or the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakeable crueltie of the aduersaries could haue restrayned it selfe within the boundes and limittes of modestie and measure, <hi>Luther</hi> would haue holden his peace: As appeareth by his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters directed both to the Bishop of Rome, and to Cardinall <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ietane,</hi> signifieng vnto them his vnfayned scile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce therein, so that his aduersaries mouthes might be stopped also: which request was not onely reasonable, but agreable also to pietie, in men of their profession especially: for as much as <hi>Luthers</hi> Assertions conteyned nothyng preiudiciall to the Byshop of Rome: and the matter had not as yet gone so farre forth, but might haue bene easily husht vp if at least they could not otherwise finde in their hartes to yeld to the manifest truth. But the Pontificall cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of the Byshop would not so be daunted: neither could the vnmeasurable mawe of his greédy Cormorauntes be so easily satisfied: and at the last the old Prouerbe (Gold is good chaffer

of his own fraternitie, bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therfore to sturre these coales. And this he iustifieth to be true by wordes vttered out of his owne mouth. For whenas in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beginnyng of his disputation agaynst <hi>Eckius</hi> he seémed somewhat to passe the bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des of modesty, and was aduertized therof by some,<note place="margin">Stanislaus Hosius in his first booke of heresies.</note> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in Gods cause he should mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate him selfe in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> spirit of lenitie: he affirmeth, that he brake out into these speaches: namely y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> those disputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s were neither begon for Gods sake, nor could be ended for Gods sake. Which wordes to be either falsely imagine vpon <hi>Luther</hi> by his aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries &amp; neuer spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of him, or els not vttered in that sense as they be alledged by <hi>Hosius,</hi> the matter it selfe doth expresse the same w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> open &amp; euident proofes.

               <hi>Luther</hi> not by any probable coniecture so much, considering he was by <hi>Eckius</hi> forced to disputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> very much agaynst his will. But we will speake of <hi>Hosius</hi> an other tyme by gods permissio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>

Nay rather why shamed he not to abuse the name of his Christ, &amp; his Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, in so false and filthy a matter?

how many new straunge stragglers, bussardly blynde and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne Raggmalles to the Auncient fathers? And so couple them together, as thinges most necessary to mans Saluation, and for these also keepe a greater coyle, then for the very articles of the Creéde. Wherof we shall treate more at large in place fitt for it by Gods grace.</p>
            <p>And therefore whereas you say that you obserue one vnifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie of fayth, I would first learne, what poynts you do ground this vniformitie vpon.

            <p>Euen as fruiolous and vayne, may I say, is all the rest that followeth concerning your Church: vpon the which when yeé haue bestowed neuer so many delicate colours, and besmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ared her with neuer so freshe and oryent oyles, &amp; berduers, yet shall you seeme to doe nothing but bedawbe olde rotten putrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed walles with new morter. Let no man sinisterly interprete of these wordes, as spoken agaynst the true church of Christ. I do knowe and confesse, that Christ neuer wanted, neyther shall euer want his Church, which shall continue one vniforme, holy, Apostolicke, and truely Catholicke: which being builded vpon the rock of the Apostles, shall enioy generall participation in one body, and within one bowells as it were with the whole co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth all men to obedience and subiection) prescribe that the Ministers of the Church aboue all others chiefly, should cast away all Souereigntie and Lordlynes?<note place="margin">The doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the Gospell doth call all the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the Church to humilitie &amp; permitteth superioritie to none in any wise.</note> and should be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with pouertie? in so much that amongest the Apostles them selues, it would admitte to superioritie?

the authoritie of the Romishe Seé onely, as though there were none other authoritie elles, that might stay sectes and Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, besides this Romishe Pope onely.

            <p>If we make sectes and schismes, as often as interpretours doe varie in opinion, in their seuerall Expositions of the holy Scriptures, amongest so many of all the Rabbines (which haue wonderfully trauailed in the explication of the old Testament) how many (I say) of them do agreé together in all pointes? what a difference is there in their Commentaries? yea how often doe the <hi>Hebrues</hi> them selues varie in their Expositions? so that the old Prouerbe may be well verified here: so many heades, so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wittes.

               <p>I suppose that there is no man now that doth not very playnely perceaue and see (though I would surcesse here to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequute any more) how men may duely and vprightly esteéme of all this whole Seé and pontificall religion: whiche seémeth for no other purpose erected, but to some discorde, and rayse vppe vproares and Tumultes.

out to speake nothing in the meane time of those sectes of errors and wicked doctrine, moyling and turmoyling one agaynst an other in such an vnmeasurable quantitie skattered abroad, that there, is skarse any one thing (wherein they agreé amongst the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>But to let passe these sectes and factions of the Romanistes.

               </p>
               <p>All which tend hereunto at the laste, to witte, that we should humbly submit our selues to the Bondage of the Pope: for this is the pleasaunt bayte whereat <hi>Osorius</hi> would haue vs fayne to be hooked, this is his whole practise and endeuour.

               <p>But go to, Let vs eyther imagyne and confesse vnto him, that these sectes and Diuisions of opinions do waxe somewhat rawe in many places, after that this romish Authoritie is neglected: what shall he winne thereby? doth he surmise this to be matter sufficient to make vs forsake y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gospell of Christ? and to knitt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> romishe halter vpon our neckes agayne? or doth he iudge it a reasonable matter, (because there want not some in some places that are ouer greedely geuen to sectes and deuisions) that it may not therefore be lawfull for others, which teache sound doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, to professe boldly before the people the rules, and order of good and honest lyfe?

Albeit I know that there be many which doe wickedly wrest, and wrieth the holy Scriptures, to their peuish sensuality, and corrupt hereticall affections: Yet forasmuch as this commeth to passe, not through the fault of tounges, in the which the enlightned efficacy of the holy Ghost doth speake in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently to all creatures ingenerall without exception, but through the peruerse waywardnesse of some men, abusing good thinges for the most part, to an euill purpose: I seé no cause why the reading of holy scriptures (in what toung soeuer,) may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing preiudiciall to the lay people: so y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they be endued w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> an earnest godly desire, wh is the best interpretor to the vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Gods word: On the contrary part, where so euer wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth this godly affection of minde; (which is gouerned by the holy Ghost,) there the reading is very perilous doubtles, yea euen in the learned themselues. Therefore where these wise fathers are

so prouident to preserue the vnlettered from gathering a dim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of vnderstanding, by reading Gods word: I cannot discern wherein their wisedome may be praysed.

But now whereas these godlye Catholickes do so behaue themfelues, as that they cannot choose but feéle the Gospell of Christ directly repugnant agaynst their intollerable pride, their horrible cruelty, theyr peéuish decreés, their stately dignities, their vnmeasureable couetousnesse, their pompous trayue, and theyr vnspekeable lust, and portlye Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, their filthye superstition, and abhominable Idolatry: what maruell is it, if they prouide so circumspectly, that the greater part of the people may not become acquaynted with the Scriptures? because they may more freely disport them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, in that generall blindenes of men, and rule the roast as they list.</p>

               <p>But if those flames, and firebrandes of lust and lechery heé throughly mortified by this pontificall prouision (as you say) herein surely I do commend your diligence, and allow wel your prouidence.

By meanes wherof if any thing fall out vnhonest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly handled amongest men of your coate, the same may be coucht close in your couert confessions, but if any lay perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shall chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to tread his shoe awrye, the commodity thereof may redound to your coffers as profitable for the pursse: wherein although (to say the truth) I cannot tell what certeintye I may determine of your dealings, yet this one thing doth minister me much matter of suspicion: That amongst so many dayly and hourely whoore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and adulteries (wherof some lay men now and then paye for the pottadge, especially the poore) neuer any priest hetherto hath bene knowen to be cited to your courtes for whooredome or adultery, or put to any penaunce for the same.</p>
               <p>But to confesse thus much vnto you, which cannot well be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied: that in all well ordered common weales, consideration ought to be had of no one thing more circumspectly, then that pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uision to be made vpon some greéuous penaltye for the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of filthy lust, and vnbrideled licentiousnesse of leud liuing: yet do I not seé any such great necessitye, why the authority and ouersight of such punishmentes, should be more appropriate to the iurisdiction of your consistories, then to the temporall magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate.

And can you say now that this Seraphicall maiestie was either deliuered vnto them from others? or raked to themselues by their owne tyranny, for the punishment of lust, and not rather to support and mayntayn it? As though if popes and byshoppes were orderly vsed (as sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth meétest for their personages,) the world should want meéte magistrates to punish fornication and adulteries: I speake not this to the derogatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the authority of godly ministers, and bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopps, which I do hartely with they may throughly enioy, yet would I the same to be no vsurped power, but a true and lawful authority.<note place="margin">How farre the lawfull authority of the church extendeth it selfe.</note> Neither, do I desire the authority of good and Godly Byshoppes to be empayred, (that authority I meane whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to they are authorized by Gods word), but I like not that Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall Tyranny of counterfait Cloysterers, and popish prelats.

I thinke neither you will, nor iustly can iustifie your saying agaynst all:<note place="margin">An aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere in the behalfe of the Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theranes li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues agaynst slau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deryng.</note> no more can ye agaynst ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them: for as much as ye know not throughly, the one halfe of our conuersations. But if you thinke thus of some particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler person, why do ye maruell so much at this? sithence the state and condition of mans life attained neuer yet so perfect a feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie, but that there was alwayes iust cause of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaint agaynst the maners of many men, and the worst part commonly were more in nomber the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the better. Yea in Paradise it selfe: sithence man and woman alone, beyng but two onely could not liue long together in that humaine flesh, without sinne, how much lesse is this to be wondered in a multitude? And yet in respect of those some persons (whom you note as it were with a coale) I know some also, and could note them by name, whose commendable conuersation of life I would rather chuse, then all the holynes of all your Portingalls whatsoeuer: vnlesse you demeane your sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues more godly at home in Portingall, then some of you lately behaued your selues here in England, whom notwithstandyng I will not at this present openly diffame, nor speake of them all that I know: concealing their names of set purpose, to the end your noble Nation shall not be infamed for their lewdenes by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reporte of myne. And therfore let all that be Catholick be heauenly and Angelicke also for me. And in this sort also had it bene as seémely for you (good Catholicke Syr) not to haue rusht so rudely with your vnmanerly penne agaynst them, whose maners be altogether as farre from your knowledge, as their names be.</p>
               <p>As touchyng report, what hath bene carried vnto you, or what not, I do not so much esteéme: which (as you know) carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth lyes for the more part, rather then truth. But admitte that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> report be true: marke yet I pray you, how iniurious and slau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous you are both in respect of the persons agaynst who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you do inueighe so much,<note place="margin">It is one thyng to iudge of maners an other thing to iudge of doctrine.</note> &amp; in respect of the cause which you do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende. For wheras they do treate vpon Relligion and doctrine onely, you apply all the action to life and maners, without all co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betwixt these two. For whereas Rel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb facs="tcp:3766:356"/>
is referred to God onely: and maners respect mans state, and condition properly: hereby it commeth to passe, that in that one nothyng ought to be permitted, except it be most sincere and pure: and in these other nothyng at all can be founde that is in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny respect perfect. Now if the order and course of mans life be not in all pointes correspondent to that absolute, and exact rule of doctrine, which we professe: yet doth this neither countenau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce your errour: nor preiudice the sinceritie of the Relligion that is taught out of the Gospell. Wherfore this was altogether be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the cushian <hi>Osorius,</hi> to raunge so lauishly agaynst men, &amp; to speake so litle of the matter and substaunce of the question, which concerned not mens maners, but the pointes of doctrine properly. But peraduenture this place serued here to the Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toricall commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> place of vice and vertue, taken out somewhere of some Oratours booke, which perhappes you would haue cleane forgotten, vnlesse you had furbushed it a fresh at this present. Wherein notwithstandyng I do neither disallow your diligence much, nor despise your Rhetoricall florishyng, and beautifieng of righteousnesse. For I know and confesse that this integritie of life (which you comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de so highly) apperteineth much to the dignifieng of the Church. But yet this great boast maketh but small roast, and serueth as litle to this present cause.</p>
               <p>Which in deéde is this: That a playne demonstration ought to haue bene made by the testimony of the Scriptures, not what is pure, or what is corrupt, in mens maners: but in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies of Relligion what is true, and what is false.

And yet in this your accusation agaynst them, you do so enforce the whole bent of your Inuectiue and speach, as that no part thereof at all carrieth any shew of truth, nor agreément in it selfe.</p>
               <p>First you doe say,<note place="margin">Osori. pag. 180.181.</note> 
                  <hi>That these men tooke vpon them this enterprise of a great courage, arrogancie, and boldnesse, whereby they promised to reforme the corrupt maners of the Church, accordyng to her former auncient beauty: and to bryng this to passe, they bounde them selues by solemne oathe.</hi> Which I haue already declared to be most vntrue: yea y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole world witnessing same, though I would hold my peace. Yea annexe further, <hi>That many ordinau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces well established in the Church first, are taken away by them and abrogated.</hi> Which also hath bene disproued to be no lesse friuolous &amp; vaine. Nay rather, if I should tell you, as it is in deéde: you should haue sayd rather. That many thynges haue bene brought into the Church by your Catholickes, long sithence the tyme of the Apostles and auncient Fathers: so weake of them selues, so fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolous, and so absurde: as could by no meanes endure the gliste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng Beames of the Orient Gospell,<note place="margin">The popes blynd De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not away with the light of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell.</note> but must neédes immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately at the very sounde of the Trumpet of truth, fall downe of them selues to the grounde, and vanish quite out of sight, yea without touch of breath as they say. And hereupon came it, that the Seé of that Beast was darkened: hereof came it, that the Denne of momishe Monckes neuer founded by God, were roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted cleane: vppe hereof came it, that their goodes and possessions were dispersed abroad: their temples destroyed: their Images, Altares, Idolles, Monumentes of prophane superstition shyue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in peéces: Finally whatsoeuer was repugnaunt to Christes Gospell, whatsoeuer apperteined not to his glory, whatsoeuer hypocrisie had heretofore builded vpon the Sandes, and not vpon the <hi>Rocke</hi> Christ: came all to vtter ruine. And there is no doubt, but that your Mytred pride <hi>Osorius</hi> together with that intollerable arrogancy, and insolent hautynes of Romish Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,

In this therefore that <hi>Luther</hi> teacheth, that fayth onely doth iustify in the sighte of God, is no new doctrine, but the doctrine of Paule.

And what is this els, then to preach vtterly an other Christ then whom the Apostles haue taught? They acknowledge him to be heauenly, you make him earthly. Theyr doctrine doth rayse vs from the earth vppe on high, where Christ sitteth at the right hand of God the Father: Your doctrine what doth it? whereunto tendeth it? whether doth it call the mindes of Christians? but from aboue downeward, out of heauen into the earth, withdrawing the senses from the Spirite, to the flesh: So that we must seéke for Christ there, not where he is, but where you imagine him to be present. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle Paule when he preacheth vnto vs the liuely feature of this Christ (who taking vpon him the shape of a Seruaunt, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered death in the same shape, once for our sinnes vnder <hi>Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Pilate,</hi> and afterwardes accomplishing the mistery of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption rose agayne for our iustification) doth teach vs playn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he ascended into heauen, not leauing his body (wherein he

And that besides this Christ onely, he knew none other Christ, nor this Christ otherwise, then according to the new cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature onely, namely: visible in spirite, with the eyes of fayth, and not with fleshlye eies. Let vs make now a comparison be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt this Christ of our Gospell, with that your Christ of the Pope, in the same manner as you do fashion him, and make a gaze of him to the eies, and eares of the people after the order of your Gospel: which seémeth to me to be after this manner: not as hauing taken vpon him, the shape of a seruaunt, but the forme of bread, is in the same forme of bread, and vnder the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents of bread made of wheat, set out to the gaze of the people to be tooted vpon, and is of Christians worshipped, and offered to God the Father, and this not once, but dayly: not vnder <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Pilate,</hi> but vnder the Pope of Rome, not a Sacrifice one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the quicke, but for the soules in Purgatory also, to the washing away of theyr synnes: Which Sacrifice being ended, he is buried in deéd, but buryed or rather drowned in the paunch of a priest, from whence he neither riseth agayne, nor ascendeth afterwardes, but descendeth rather: nor is euer looked for to come agayne from thence. And this is that same Christ, not the Euangelicall Christ, but the Papisticall and poeticall Christ: whom thought the Apostles or Euangelistes neuer knew, yet must we be enforced (will we nyll we) to honor and worshippe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse as the very Sauiour of the world forsooth.

               <p>
                  <pb n="355" facs="tcp:3766:375"/>For such was the lyfe of Christians in that purer age,<note place="margin">The lynes and couer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the primitiue Church.</note> that they would not swerue one tytle so much from their profession: Moreouer such was their profession, that it would not raunge an hearebredth from the prescript rule of the Institutions Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolique.

As for delightes, and pleasures, to rake ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches together, to build pallaces, to seéke the exalting of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues by honorable titles, and dignityes, they had neuer one minute of spare tyme to bestowe their wittes vpon. Their dayly exercise then was a continuall wresting agaynst the world, and the Deuill. They spent all their tyme in labors, and perills: their whole lyfe was a paynfull turmoyle: all their power was nought els but prayer. Their fortresse was grounded vpon Christ: Yea for Christ onely was their whole warfare. Neither were those valiant souldiours destitute in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meane time of a singuler Chefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne: Christ himselfe was the chief generall of this Army: who did either mitigate the horror, and cruelty of their agonyes, by his omnipotent power: or with some comfortable restoratyue, qualifie their greéues: so ordering, and attempering the proceé<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyngs, and alterations of his Church, that he would neither suffer the vaynes, and sinowes of the same to gather any infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by ouerflowing plenty of ytching delights of this flattering world: nor to be discouraged or vanquished with any immoderat assaultes, or excessiue stormes of aduerse fortune: and at the last would conduct them to a ioyfull Triumph, and end of all their Troubles, and afflictions.</p>

And therfore we creditt the Church as a Mistres and a teacher, foreshewing the truth: yet after an other maner al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together, then as we be bound to obey the word of the Gospell, preached in the Church, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mouth of Gods faythfull ministers: which authoritye, when they put in execution according to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritye of Gods word, we doe beleue them: yet so neuerthelesse beleue them, as that our creditt is not grounded now vpon the testimonie of the Church, nor vpon men, but vpon the worde of God: namely because their iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is agreable, and consonant with the rule of the sacred scriptures, and with a free confession of the Godly, iudging directly, accordyng to the voyce and worde of God.</p>
               <p>The Church therfore hath authoritie, in decyding controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies of doctrine? Yet so, that it selfe must be ouerruled by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the word: Otherwise the Church hath neither authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye,

nor iudgement, contrary to the consonancy of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.

And therefore they minister correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with punishment corporall, according to the qualitye of the trespasse. But the iudgements of the Church are farre vnlyke: For in those maner of offences which appertayne to the ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall Consistorye, the Church hath her proper iudgements, and peculiar punishments. Wherewith it doth not afflict, or crucifie mens bodyes notwithstandyng, nor pursue vnto death: but cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth of from the congregation onely, and common society of men, such as doe wilfully, and stubburnely sett themselues agaynst the Ministerye: and such as doe harden themselues, and obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately perseuer in wickednes, agaynst order, and conscience, and continue in errors, and other notorious crimes, contrary to the prescript rule of sound doctrine: Agaynst such the Church thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth out endles excommunicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, denoficing the horrible curse of Gods euerlasting wrath, and vnappeasable displeasure, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they repent.

in that one, and so white liuered and caponlike in this other?

(say you,) but the wickednes, and abhominations of this age doe much displease me: with that am I worthely offended. And what good or godly man is not throughly displeased herewith? Peruse who will the writings of <hi>Luther, Melanckton, Bucer, Zuinglius, Martyr, Caluine,</hi> and he shall easely peceaue that this deadly decay of Godly lyfe, was no lesse greuous to euery of them, then to your selfe: that I neéde neuer speake of this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, to witt, that <hi>Luther</hi> being very oftentymes disquieted with the maners, and vnthankefulnes of his own countrey men, did long before with a very propheticall vehemencye foretell, that the same lamentable slaughter should befall them,<note place="margin">Luther of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded with the life of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey men.</note> for their vngratefull contempt of Euangelicall lyfe, wherewith not long after they were greuously pinched.

               <p>But here is yet another argument clowted vppe, and patcht together with the lyke stuffe: whereby he would proue vpon trust of hys Rhethoricke. <hi>That these false Prophets Lutherans, were not sent from God.</hi> Let vs first note the wordes which he citeth out of the Scriptures.<note place="margin">Osor. pag. 187.</note> 
                  <hi>Marke well</hi> (sayth he,) <hi>What the Lord spake of a false Prophet: The Prophet that is puft vp with pride, and will speake in my name the thing that I doe not commaund him to speake, or in the name of any other straunge Godds, let him be slayne. And if in your se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret conceypt you thinke with your selfe, how shall I vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that it is not the word of God, that he hath spoken. Take this for a signe: Whatsoeuer that Prophet shall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy in my name, and it come not to passe: that hath not the Lord spoken, but the Prophet himselfe hath imagined it, through the pride of his owne hart, and therefore thou shalt not feare him. &amp;c.</hi> Where is this? Seéke for it Reader in the old Testament, or in the new, for eyther it pleased not <hi>Osorius</hi> to note the place, or perhappes it serued not for his purpose so to doe.

               <p>Forsooth, hauing vttered this much first by way of preamble. <q>It followeth now <hi>(sayth he,)</hi> that we see what Luther, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancton,

Bucer, Caluine, and the other iolly companions haue promised and vndertaken to doe, what hope they haue geuen of their glorious promises, to witt, that it should come to passe, that they would call home agayne the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of the Gospell to her auntient sinceritye, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store Religion, hold vpp the Church that was ready to fall downe: That is to say, that they would fully restore the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed fayth of the Church, restore lenitye, Chastitye, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, Vnitye, Modestye, Obedience, Charitye together with godlynes, and great bountye of godly loue. All these things wherof they promised largely, and in many wordes to bring to passe: it lacketh so much of thacomplishment of their promise, that they haue left all things in farre more worse case, more peruerse, more filthy, and more deformed by the meanes of their goodly trauayle: as men that haue placed Sacrilege, in stead of Religion: Crueltye in stead of Lenytye: Tumults in stead of Peace: Ciuill warre in stead of Concord: Licentiousnes of lyfe in stead of chastity: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Magistrates, in stead of Obedience: Pride in stead of Modestye: Finally in stead of Charitye, and Pietye, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitye and hatred amongest good men: Monstruous wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes, and vtter ouerthrow, and confusion of all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weales.

of both paraduenture the Reader will looke fort thother the fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the argument doth perswade me to doe. For what can be spoken more senselesly? what can be more crookedly wrested out of the whole Scriptures? what could haue bene attempted more cruelly, and falsly agaynst godly personages? what could haue bene concluded more absurdly? First there is a place vou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched out of the Scripture, wherein the people is taught, how they may discerne a false Prophet fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a true: namely by the true successe, &amp; euent of thinges: as farre forth as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thinges foretold doe happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or not happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And yet in this behalfe also speciall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of choyse ought to be hadd, &amp; some secret inspiration of the holy ghost: For although Caiphas be sayd to haue foretold, as the trueth was. Yet will you not geue him a place emongest the holy Prophets: So also neither did Balaam lye altogether when in a Propheticall speach, he foretold the people of God, good and gladsome tidings: yet I thinke you will not nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber him emongest the Godly Prophets of God.<note place="margin">1.

                     </gap>.</note> Lykewise also in the Acts of thapostles: The Prophetisse at Phillippos dyd prophecye ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things of Paul, and Timothe which were true and maruai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous: yet will no man assigne her a place emongest the true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetisses. What shall we say of the Deuil himselfe? which dyd foretell to <hi>Siluerster</hi> the Pope,<note place="margin">A true dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the false and the true Prophett.</note> that he should neuer dye before he came vnto Ierusalem? what? was not the sequel aunswera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to hys former tale? How then <hi>Osorius</hi>? are those then to be acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted the true Prophets of God, which doe foretell y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thinges that shall come to passe? I thinke not so: Neither doth the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture affirme the same to be true. The true Prophets of God doe pronounce truely from out the true treasures of the hart. And not contrarywise, all they that doe tell true thinges altogether, ought alwayes to be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for true Prophets of God: But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer he be that teacheth false Doctrine, and is found a lyar: it is most certein that he is not sent of God. Telling trueth ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore namely in Successes humaine, doth not alwaye asrgue him that doth foretell the same to be a true Prophet of God. But lying doth alwayes bewray a false Prophet. And this is it, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb facs="tcp:3766:398"/>
the Scripture would haue vs to be forewarned in this place. For the wordes of the Scripture doe not so directly determine, that euery person whosoeuer foretelleth the trueth of euery thing is therefore sent from God. But it setteth downe this speciall marke: That yf any Prophet haue foretold any thing in the name of the Lord, which doth not afterwades come to passe, By thys marke (sayth the Scripture) shall you know, that a man hath spoken it, and not the Lord:
<q>Then which signe <hi>(say you)</hi> no thing can be more sure, nothing more euident, nothing more commodious for our sauetye.</q>

Melancthon,</hi> and their companyons? <hi>Because they haue promised</hi> (say you) so <hi>largely and so lowdly, whereas they gaue so great a hope of themselues by their glorious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, that it should come to passe, that they would call backe agayne the decayed lyfe of the Christians, and the dissolute maners of the Church, to the auncient purity of the Gospell: they did so performe nothing of that they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, that they left all thinges in far worse case then they receaued them.</hi> I will aunswere to both. And first your alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of their promises, we haue shewed already how it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together vntrue: to the iustyfying of which flaunder agaynst the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you haue not brought forth one sillable so much hitherto, out of all the writinges of <hi>Luther,</hi> or <hi>Melancton,</hi> wherewith you are able to charge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: Whereas on thother side it will be no matter of difficultye for me to conuince you for an open lyar, by innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable places out of <hi>Luther</hi> himselfe: Emo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gest many I will cyte one, by the which the Reader may easily vnderstand, how farre of <hi>Luther</hi> was from that glorious kinde of braggery of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, wherewith you doe slaunder him most Impudently. For after this manner doth he make a reporte of himselfe, writing v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Psalmes of degreés.<note place="margin">Luther vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the 130. Psalme.</note>
                  <q>I doe gladly vse (<hi>sayth</hi> Luther,) mine owne experience: for what is it, or how much is it, that he hath geuen to me alone? I did desire no thing els, then that this abuse of pardons might be taken away: But behold what an vnmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surable Sea of Gods marueilous bounty and liberality ensued ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon?
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:3766:398"/>
So that it is generall true, that no man dare wishe so much as God is ready to geue. The cause is the mistrust fulnesse of our hart, the lacke of hope, and weakenes of fayth.</q>
Thus much <hi>Luther.</hi> Go to now, and where is now that glorious hope promised, and bragge of promise, whereas himselfe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaineth of wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of hope, of mistrustfulnes of hart, and weakenesse of fayth? or vpon what confidence could he dare promyse so largely, and boldly to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that which him selfe confesseth playnely, he durst not be so bold as to wish for?

                  </hi> what they performed, or what they did not performe in the reformation of manners, I doe not so much stand vpon: Nor do I speake all here that I could: But leaue it to the iudgement of him that shall iudge the quicke and the dead: Euery person canne iudge himselfe and his owne cause best: but of others it is very hard to determine any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynty.

It had bene more sittyng for you and your modesty, beginning at your owne home, to haue first purged your owne faultes, to haue pluckt the beames out of your owne eyes, before you had vttered such insolent waywardnesse in trou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bling of other mens studies.

But you, enflamed with (I know not what) outragious insolency of minde, not of any iudgement but of a certayne franticke fury, do so handle your cause, as though he were no good man, nor could be a good man, whosoeuer doth beare the name of a <hi>Lutherane,</hi> that is to say, a professed Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian: and as though neuer any such abhominations could haue infected the world, if <hi>Luther</hi> had nener taught at all: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which slannderous maner of speéch, what could impudency it selfe haue spoken more impudently or more vntruely?</p>

I do not thinke it. And why so? Because you will say, that herein is great difference and oddes, when as men we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise any matter to men, in the person and fidelitie of men, and when as we promise or foreprophecy in the name and person of God, thinges to come to passe: for in that one, the breach of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
<pb facs="tcp:3766:400"/>
is deceit, and lying, in the other impiety and vngodlinesse: in that first, men onely are hurt, in the other iniury is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted agaynst God. And therefore if all these your accusations be bent agaynst these persons, as agaynst false Prophettes: Make it manifest then if you can, where either <hi>Luther,</hi> or any other of the abouenamed vndertaking at any tyme the person of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phette, did prophecy of thinges that should come to passe, by the appoyntment and purpose of God, wherof the Lord neuer spake word?

               <p>Besides this commeth yet an other argument of the same stampe, skrapte out of Ieremy, agaynst those false Prophettes before, contriued with no lesse subtlety, then blazed abroad with vanity. And the place, which himselfe dayneth not to note,<note place="margin">Iere. cap. 23.</note> is in the 23. chapter.
<q>Marke therefore diligently: with what wordes God hath taught to discerne betwixt false prophettes, and true Prophets: If they had persisted stedfast in my councell <hi>(sayth he)</hi> and had declared my wordes to my people, they had surely turned my people away from their euill way, and fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their wicked thoughts,</q>
Out of these wordes of Ieremye <hi>Osorius</hi> writinge to the Queénes Maiesty doth frame an argument on this wise.
<q>If af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the arriuall of this new Gospell <hi>(sayth he)</hi> and this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of new religion: had also arriued together with the same shamefastesse, integrity, innocency and grauitye of lyfe, and vprightnesse of manners, if seuerity of life, if graue behauiour, and ciuility of manners and honesty had bene raysed vppe out of that darckenesse, wherein it was long drowned. &amp;c.</q>
I should waste much tyme to rehearse euery par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler sentence, wherewith this trifling Rhetorician, like an huckester of eloquence, doth make a huge heape of wordes in a neédelesse, long, and tedious rehearsall of vertues and vyces: wherein he might haue done much better in my iudgement, if leauing this Childish copye of countenaunce, and glorious mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of variety, he had entred vpon the matter more brieflye, playnly, and more effectually. The purport of his discourse was that he should haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uinced <hi>Luther, Melancthon</hi> and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessours
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:3766:400"/>
of the same doctrine for false prophettes. And to make this manifest, he would vse an argument framed out of Ieremy by the signes, notes, and markes wh the prophet doth sette down in speciall wordes, as I sayd before, out of which wordes, if he would haue argued, he must neédes haue concluded after thys manner.</p>
               <q>

               <p>If <hi>Osorius</hi> doe conclude his argument after this maner (as he neédes must by the wordes of the Prophet) The argument must be denyed for the fallax of the consequent.<note place="margin">Aunswere to the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.

The argument would stand well I confesse: yet should it not touch <hi>Luther</hi> at all: who was nether any of the number of those false Prophets, nor euer took vpon him the name of a prophet. But the argument would be otherwise, yf beginning at the vniuersall, he would descend to the particuler, on this wise: It will appeare euidently who be the true Prophets of God: by this token, if they reduce their auditory from Impyety to the endeauor of vertue and godlynes: <hi>Luther</hi> tooke vpon him the name of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phett, and yet reduced not his auditorie from vngodlynes. <hi>Ergo Luther</hi> and others of the same marke be false prophets. First to the <hi>Maior: Haddon</hi> doth make this aunswere: namely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying that to be true, which is affirmed in the <hi>Maior.</hi> Yf it be vnderstoode of the generall <hi>predicatum.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere to the Maior.</note> For this supposition is false, that all such as doe not reduce their anditory to amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of lyfe, be not true Prophets of God: For <hi>Ieremy</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe was not a lying Prophet: yet was not his preaching so ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall, as to allure all that hard him to a reformation of lyfe.
<pb facs="tcp:3766:401"/>
The same may be veryfied of <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> and of Chrst him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, the high and chiefe Prince of all Prophets: what shall we say to <hi>Noah</hi> the eight Partriarche of righteousnesse? who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding did prophecye, and foretell the people by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse word of God of the generall floud, and destruction of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, hanging ouer their heades a hundreth yeares before it happened: yet was it so farre of, that he could encline the people (to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was sent) to amendement of lyfe, that of all the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of <hi>Adam,</hi> were no more but eight persons onely saued.</p>
               <p>But here <hi>Osorius</hi> will take me vppe agayne for haltyng, and tell me,<note place="margin">The reason to discerne betwixt false and true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordyng to Osorius.</note> that thys is not the meanyng of the Prophett, as though he should vnderstand, that all the Auditory generally should be reclaymed, but those persons onely which doe beleue, and obeye the preaching of the Prophets: Go to, and what error was euer so peruerse, what heresy so absurde, that found not cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditte, and fawnyng fawtours somewhere? Agayne, yf you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the lyfe onely, you shall many tymes finde the conuersati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and manners of some heretiques lesse reproueable, then of some of the chiefe and principall Protestantes, or Catholickes.

God is not the Author of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cention, but of peace: I doe know this, and confesse it to be most true. So also is the same God the fountayn of all righteousnes, and father of all consolation. The same is also Author of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, and of all good thinges. Go to now: where can you finde in all the estates, courses, and actions of this transitory lyfe, that fulnes and absolute perfection of righteousnes, of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation, or of peace, yea in the most holy estate of matrimonye, as may be aunswerable to that absolute patterne of perfection? Lett it suffice vs to haue receaued the first fruits thereof, though we possesse not the Tenthes.

How is it then <hi>Osorius,</hi> that with shuttevppe eyes ye can so lightly ouerlooke, and not looke vpon so many, and so monstruous Beames ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spreadyng your Churches, and not passe ouer one litle moate in our Church without controllyng your brethren, but that ye must burst out into such whotte fury of hellish firebrandes? <hi>With the Spirite of God</hi> (say you) <hi>is no dissensio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> This is most true. And so it is true also, that <hi>Luther</hi> &amp; <hi>Zuinglius</hi> be not taken for Gods, which can not erre, nor dissent eche from other in some pointes.

The godly and auncient Fathers they do all with one consent allow, and yeld vnto, so farreforth as euery of them is founde to agreé with the expresse word of God: Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies and false opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s reproued by the authoritie of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the sacred antiquitie of the Church, they do all gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally oppugne: besides this authoritie of Scripture, &amp; the most couenable proportion of Fayth, whatsoeuer hath priuily craw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and crept in by stealth, into the profession of Fayth, and true worshyppyng of God, they do all vtterly, and worthly abhorre: whatsoeuer is most auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in Fayth, and most approued by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>Moreouer, in this they agreé together all, &amp; be of one mynde and iudgement all, namely, that the Pope of Rome is the very Antichrist, whereof they haue assured and vndoughted proofe, by the certeine and infallible Rules, and forewarnynges of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture, and by his horrible persecution of the word of God. Besides this also, that all Idolles and Images ought to

be abolished out of the Church of God: That those choppyng &amp; chaungyng of Pardons ought to be abhorred. That all affiauce of righteousnes of God ought to be settled in the onely Fayth of Iesu Christ, and in nothyng els. That superfluous vowes and Traditions of men (which do yoake fast and clogge Christian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, and well disposed consciences) ought vtterly to be aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed. That Ceremonies and Constitutions, which are ioyned with an opinion of righteousnesse, of worshyppyng, of Salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; merityng, ought worthely to be banished &amp; abandonned: that Priestes Concubines ought to be conuerted into lawfull Matrimony, that those mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>struous vpstartes of disguised pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions, rules and orders ought be rooted out, that all thyngs may be reduced and leuelled accordyng to the one vniforme con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie of the Gospell of Christ.

               <p>And that I may not passe ouer this also, that in the matter of the Sacrament (wherein consisteth the substaunce of the aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries accusatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> agaynst vs) I know not one of all those besides <hi>Luther</hi> onely (whom you call new) to witte,<note place="margin">How great a concord is ctetwixt many Chur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ches in the matter of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note>

These wordes of <hi>Haddon</hi> as though had bene vomited out from a wonderfull surfett of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sye, Osorius in great choler doth challenge, and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth with these reasons.
<q>Because without reason <hi>(as he sayth)</hi> without any testimony or exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of antiquity, without ar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gument or proofe at all, he hath spoken bare affirmatiues onely without proofe, and the same in such wise spoken, as that he seemeth to haue done nothing but spoken.</q>
And first for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Supremacy, what doth he shew?
<q>But we <hi>(sayth he)</hi> are wont to make playne demonstration by the authoritye of the sacred Scriptures, by the testimony of the holy Fathers, by the autenticke Recordes of auncient antiquity, by reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vse, and experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and by innumerable examples, that this was the Supreame head of the Church alwayes. &amp;c.</q>
If you haue so great and infinite a number of examples, wherewith you be able to iustify this Supremacy, as you say: why then out of this vnmeasurable heape vouche you not one example at the least, for examples sake, whereby we may likewise discerne this supremacy?<note place="margin">Osori. doth deale with wordes and no matter.</note> hitherto as yet I do heare nothing but bare words, and smoake, and not a sparcke so much of Reason, example, or proofe.

For in the Primitiue Church such satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions were enioyned as publicke penaunce for publicke offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces only. But your Popes Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fessioners do enioyne satisfactory penaunces, for certayne priuate and secret sinnes: The first sort were neuer ministred but in presence of the congregation onely, to serue for outward Discipline onely, and not to redeéme the wrath of God, for their sins by way of satisfiyng: and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cause why they were called <hi>Satisfactions</hi> was, because they did satisfy the opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in publique offences only. Eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so and in such wise Releases &amp; Pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s were esteémed, not to be in any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect valuable to clense the sinnes of guiltye consciences in the sight of God simply: but should be as pledges and witnesses of a full releasing their penaunce, enioyned vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the Church, or of mitigating the same with some gentle quallification. As appeareth by a Transcript drawen out of the Penitentiall of Rome vp <hi>Burchard</hi> treating much of those exchaunges of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions:<note place="margin">Burchard.</note> namely that in stead of this penaunce, where a man was enioyned to fast one whole day with bread and water, heé should be released thereof, and say fifty psalmes or Lxx. psalmes kneéling, &amp; relieue some one begger with food: If he were a rich man and vnlettered, he should redeéme one dayes penaunce by paying iij. pence: if he were poore and vnlettered, he should paye one peny, or feéd threé poore folke. The penau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of a whole weékes
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:3766:411"/>
fast, was redeémed with CCC. Psalmes: a whole mouethes fast by saying xij. hundred Psalmes: for one yeares fast, he shoulde geue in almes to the poore xxij. shillinges. &amp;c. Many other like exchaunges of penaunces are mentioned in <hi>Burchard</hi>: all which respected none other end, but that they might quallify the rigor of the olde Canons touching publique penaunce: ministred to this end, not as necessary instrumentes to obtayne remission of sinnes, and to pacify the wrath of God, but instituted for exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples sake, that they might be speciall prickes and prouoke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes to sturre vpp such as were fallen, and allurementes to earnest amendement of life.</p>
               <p>On the contrary part, the custome of our time, and of our Popes hath so farre degendred from the auncient ordinaunces of the Elders, in dispensing with Pardons and Satisfactions, that it may seéme to haue ouerwhelmed not onely all discipline of the auncient Church,<note place="margin">How much the order of the old dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline doth varry from the Romish Nouelty.</note> but also almost ouerthrowen the whole force and efficacy of Christian fayth. For whereas the Summe and Substaunce of all our Religion consisteth in the cleansing and purging of Sinnes: and the same comprehended also in the onely obedience and passion of Christ: these new vpstart Popes haue translated all this Release and satisfaction for our sinnes, from the merite of Christ, to I know not what newfangled ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions and Pardons: And whereas the olde penitentiall Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons were onely mens constitutions, wherein men might dys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence with men according to the necessity of the tyme, hereupon our Popes (taking hart of grasse) are become so shamelesse im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent, that with theyr Pardons they dare presume to dispense with mens sinnes, yea and theyr consciences also, and to make their satisfactory merites (by merite meritorious as it were) worthye, and able to encounter the wrath and iudgement of God.</p>
               <p>And now behold how many pumples and fretts lurke vnder this one skabbe of the popish doctrine.<note place="margin">The errours of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.</note> First they do so ouerlade mens consciences with a commaundement of confession, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all authority of scripture, and contrary to all the presidents of the primitiue Church: they force all persons to render an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of theyr sinnes, whether they be contrite, or not contrite, and this also vpon payne of eternall damnation: As for <hi>Absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:3766:412"/>
they leaue cleane naked of all effectualnesse, denying it to be auayleable without workes precedent: ouer and besides thys also, they do clogge them that are confessed with an vnauoyda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble necessity of doing penau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, they do thrust in Pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of sinnes graunted by mans authority, which they call <hi>Satisfaction</hi> for sinnes, to deserue freé release from that punishment &amp; payne, which the iustice of God may duely exact. Out of which Syncke proceéd many vntimely and vyperous birthes, full of lyes, sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege and blasphemy agaynst God.

                  <p>The keyes were deliuered to Peter co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fessing Christ with a true and sincere fayth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ergo.</hi> The Popes of Rome onely be the successors of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and are inuested in the possession of the same power of binding, and lousing by the expresse worde of God.</p>
               </q>
               <p>A trymm conclusion surely, &amp; very Catholick: Wherein nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Antecedent is true, and the consequent much more false: Forasmuch as neither this force of binding and lousing was geuen to Peter alone, &amp; their assumption hereof surmised, (that the Popes of Rome onely are Peters Successors) is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as false.<note place="margin">The Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolique is not to be measured by place or tyme.</note> The reason is because the simplicitye, and natiue humilitye of the Gospell doth no where acquaint it selfe with any such carnall successions, which are applyed to places, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and tymes: as neither Christes philosophye doth acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or regard carnall Fathers, Sonnes, affinities, and kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reddes? as the which doth mount on high, and doth enter by farr more excellent meanes. Goe to, yet for example sake, lett vs imagine, that Peter hadd a sonne borne vnto him by his law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full wyfe, and an other Cephas, resembling the father, and by discent and course of nature next heire: What shall we say? that this Sonne shall clayme the priuiledge of his fathers Porter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe,<note place="margin">The nature of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether spiri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tuall, nor regardeth earthly and carnall thinges.</note> because he is his next heyre? Not so you will say. And will you so flattly deny that priuiledge to naturall discent, which you yeld to place, and to a rotten outward Chayre? If Christ did neither acknowledge mother, brethren nor sisters vpon the earth, but those onely, which yelded their due obedience to his fathers commaundements, will the same Christ vouchsafe any other successors, or vicars of Peter, then such as present themselues
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:3766:417"/>
with the same cognifizaunce and badge that he did acknowledge in Peter? And admitt also the very best that maketh for you, that the Byshoppe of Rome doth with neuer so good a face pretend this authoritie from Christ: what? and be not other Byshopps of other Churches endued with semblable fayth? what preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue hath he then in this office and keéping of keyes now, as to challenge any superioritye ouer other Byshoppes, and Preside<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of the Churche?</p>
               <p>The Scripture doth in a certein place deny, that he which hath not the spirite of Christ, is of Christ.:<note place="margin">The spirite of Christe.</note> Now this spirite of Christ (wheresoeuer it resteth) is humble and meéke, regardeth not the thinges of the earth, seéketh not her owne, suffereth the iniuries of others: offereth iniury to none, neither reuengeth any iniury offred to himselfe: haleth no man to the slaughter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house: thyrsteth after euery mans sauetye: yea prayeth also for his enemies earnestly: doth receaue the weake in fayth: doth op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse no man: endureth many thinges: becometh all in all to all persons, that he may winne all vnto Christ: accompteth other mens chaunces, good or badde, as his owne: lyueth not to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe: but to the publique benefite of many: doth amend that is amisse:<note place="margin">The succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter doth consist in spirite not in externall thinges.</note> addresseth that which is out of order: recouereth the lost: recomforteth the dispeired estates: finally doth not breake in peé<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the shieuered Reéde: For in very deéde the spirite of Christe canne not be vnlyke to Christ himselfe: And therefore hereof we may well conclude, that wheresoeuer this spirite doth plant his Seate, there doughtles is the successor of Peter, there be the true keyes of the Church.</p>
               <p>I doe not presume here to iudge of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> spirite of the Pope, he hath his Iudge, and shall haue his daye of iudgement, which shall display abroad into open light, &amp; secrets of all darkenes.

Church of Christ. For if by those keyes, power of bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and lousing be figured (as hath bene allready spoken) these keyes though Peter receaued first in deéde, yet did not he alone receaue them: nor did euer at any tyme exercise the power of the same otherwise, then as he did enioye them together with tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Apostles, which for asmuch as is confirmed by very many infallible profes, and established by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuall vnbroke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> course of auncient Antiquitye: as also witnessed euidently, by the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of the Cannons in the Councels of <hi>Ancyra,</hi> and <hi>Nice,</hi> (whereof we made mencion before) where it is sayd, that the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of the Church was then such, as that euery Byshoppe should haue the order and ouersight of euery his peculiar Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince, and vpon due consideration of the behauiour of the Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiaries, might lawfully either mittigate, shorten, or cutt of the tyme of their penaunce,<note place="margin">The 5.

But I thinke it not amisse to couer <hi>Osorius</hi> nakednes here?

When as Emperours ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged furiously agaynst the first entrye, and beginning of Christes Church, albeit very many godly Fathers gaue their lyues, with wonderfull constancye, for the testimony of the trueth: Yet did not all persist in lyke constancye of minde: but many of them falling away from their profession to Idolls, were holden guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye of Idolatry &amp; sacriledge: Who notwithstanding, renouncing their Paganisme, and retourning to Christ, ministred occasion to the Elders to pause awhiles, and to take breath vpon good aduise, what were best to be done, with them. It was concluded at the last, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mercy ought not to be denyed to these backslyders: Yet so, as they should not by and by be restored to the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb facs="tcp:3766:423"/>
whom they hadd offended by their euill example: by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourming some penaunce prescribed vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for a certain space of tyme. In the meane tyme as euery of the Penitentiaries seé<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to grow in greater carelessnes of their penaunce, so was their penaunce aggrauated, and lesse consideration hadd of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leasing their punishment. At the last the persecution being cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, yet ceased not the infirmity of sinning: Whereupon the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steritye followed the example of their predecessors vpon lyke oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion ministred by obstinate sinners.</p>
               <p>Then were added certein Cannons gathered together out of Councells, first from the Councells of <hi>Ancyra,</hi> and <hi>Nyce,</hi> and from the Councells following.<note place="margin">Cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitentiall described by Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard and Gratian.</note> A transcript whereof was made by <hi>Buchard</hi> and <hi>Gracian</hi> whiche the <hi>Latines</hi> doe call <hi>Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiales</hi> and the Grecians <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> as is before mencioned. Wherein was comprehended how much penaunce was prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed for euery particular fault. Neuerthelesse some qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the sharpenes of the sayd Canons was ministred to the <hi>Penitentiaries,</hi> through the clemency, and humanitye of the Pastors, accordyng to the qualitye of the trespasses and estates of the persons. And this kinde of discipline of the Canons, was exercized yet in a certein meane state of the Church, by the space of a thowsand yeares, and somewhat more: vntill at the last the auncient sincerity of the Primitiue purenesse beginning to waxe colde, and the rigor of the olde Canons growing by litle &amp; litle out of vse, or chaunged into lighter burdeines: new Pardons exept in place, which were not onely abrydgementes, and ease<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of those penaltyes, that apperteined to the censure of the Church, but which did stretch further a great deale, to absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>a paena,</hi>

               <p>Whiles these thyngs were a doyng: and freé Pardons flewe abroad now euery where thorough all Churches without mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure (which happened not long before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> yeare of our Lord. 1200) by and by began question to be made by whom those Pardons might be graunted: by their Parish Priest onely? or by any other
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:3766:423"/>
of like dignitie? or by a superior power? After that this kynde of dispensation was translated to Byshops and Archbyshops onely. And at the last came it in question where the full power of plenary Pardons should rest? Which after solemne disputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, was agreed and concluded vpon, must neédes be in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Byshop of Rome. In the meane space was a Councell Sommoned to be holden at <hi>Laterane,</hi>

<q>We <hi>(sayth the Canon)</hi> will and commaunde that these abuses, by colour where of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall Iurisdiction groweth to naught, and the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the Church keyes is brought into contempt, be vtterly abandoned and abolished. &amp;c.</q>

This was so haynous a matter, that the Popes Councell could not be able to disgest it. And hereupon began that crowyng a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst the poore Proctours, as I sayd before, not so much for that they did abuse their Indulgences, to gayne and lucre (for what els haue the Popes them selues done at any tyme) But by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Romishe Rauens felt no small feathers pluckt from their backes. For these great wise men foresawe that (which was true in deéde) that if other Churches might be at freé liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to bynde and louse as farreforth as they, this would grow to no small preiudice to the Primacy. And therefore was a prety waye founde out, whereby all this absolute power of Pardons (which at that season seémed in deéde generall to all Churches indifferently) beyng afterwardes taken away from all the rest, should be annexed to the Seé of Rome onely: nor should from thenceforth be attempted by any other inferiour Byshops or go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours of Churches, vnlesse speciall graunt therof were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined and had from the Maiestie and fullnesse of the Seé Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolique first.</p>

And yet <hi>Osorius</hi> doth deny that euer any such sales and markettes were made of such marchaundise of the Romaine Church, either knowen to the Pope, or allowed by him.</p>
               <p>Now I would desire thee gentle Reader to think vpon this with me. Whereas in disposing these Pardons, the Popes vse not a like proportio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> towards all perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: wherof to some grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts are more large: to some more cutted and short: whereas to some persons full Remission is geuen: to some euerlastyng, and to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers a third endeale of their Sinnes forgeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: to some xij. thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand yeares, to others viij. thousa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d yeares, to many vij. yeares, or xij. yeares are released out of Purgatory: vpon what grew this inequabilitie and parcialitie of dispensation, if there were no stakes layed downe for the game? whereby it came to passe, that the best purse escaped the greatest curse, and the more man would geue, the more the Pope would relieue, euen to the full fullnes: but he that sowed thinne, his Pardon should be scarse worthe a pyane. I purpose not to rippe vppe the remembraunce of these Reliques by examples, which are past noumber. I will tell you of one in our owne Realme of England in a Towne cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

I am not very inquisitiue to learne what the Somme amounted vnto of that monstruous markett: onely this one thing would I haue <hi>Osorius</hi> to be throughly perswaded, that if he be of that minde yet, that those Bulles are obteyned <hi>gratis</hi> without money, and begged onely of the Seé of Rome: I haue president sufficient in my custodye, wherewith I cann conuince him of vanitye, and folly.</p>
               <p>There are not many yeares sithe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce the Surges of the swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Seas surrounded all the low countrye of Flaunders,<note place="margin">A History of Flaunders.</note> which ministred a lamentable spectackle to the whole nation to behold: By and by flew abroad Bulles of the highest and most liberali fulnesse. The case it selfe moued all men to pitty very much, and amongest the rest the fauour and authority of the Pope Adrian being a Germayne borne, during whose Popedome this pittyfull case befell: Legates were sent abroad, who taking view of all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and breaches, were able to make a true report of the wreckes that neéded reliefe, and what the charge thereof would amount vnto. The masse of money that was leuied by the meanes of those Bulles, as was vnmeasureable, so where it vanished away could not be knowen: yea but it was knowne to well: the poore countrey bare the name, but others carryed away the game, and no penny therof employed to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vse for the which the foresayd col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection was pretended. Many such pageantes haue bene played by the Byshops of Rome. But Mystres money made vpp al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes the peryode of the play. Let vs call to remembraunce the ages of our auncestors which were but a whiles sithence, and note well the Actes and Recordes of the same within these fewe yeares: for what is he so blockish, who but meanely acquaynted with the late Chronographers canne not easily perceiue those practizes? whenas he shall read of so many bloudy battels, so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny preparatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> recouery of the holy Land, shall heare of so many redd Crosses beautifully blazed and embrodered with the Popes trypie Crowne, &amp; with a skarlett Boxe, whenas he shall

Now must there be a leauy raysed agaynst the Turke: by and by the Pope is in great hassard, by force of the enemy: then comes there a <hi>Iubilee</hi> euery hundred yeare first, not long after an other <hi>Iubilee</hi> euery fifteth yeare: the last euery xxv. yeare: that so the retourne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more speédy might also be more neédy, &amp; call for more reliefe. Within a whiles after the Church of Saynt Peter must be built vpon the hill called <hi>Vaticanus mons</hi> in Rome.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Osori pag. 196.</note>OF Images what shall I say? sithence hereof hath bene spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken sufficiently enough already: and sith he also alledgeth no new matter but olde and bare names onely of <hi>Nazianzene, Basile, Ierome,</hi> and <hi>Ambrose</hi>: neither vouching any places of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Authors in the meane space, nor citing any example at all out of any theyr writinges.

<pb n="405" facs="tcp:3766:426"/>
euen this they do say. <hi>They doe extoll and magnifye with all the ornamentes of Eloquence such holye Sainctes and godly Martyres, to whom was geuen this high honour and glory to persist stoughtely in the face of the Enemie, for the testimony of Christ, and to washe their garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes in the bloud of the Lambe, their vnua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quishable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy and heauenly fortitude of courage: theyr names, actes, and Monumentes they do aduaunce very studiously and religiously, they pray all night before their Tombes: and exhort other godly congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to read ouer their Actes and Monumentes, and to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate theyr memorialles:</hi> Where is all this <hi>Osorius</hi>? and from whence fetch ye this ware? Seéke for it good Readers, and let it not be tedious vnto you to peruse the volumes of the Doctours ouer and ouer. And here by the way especially, let <hi>Haddon</hi> be ashamed which hath so whollye addicted himselfe to the perusing of <hi>Accursianes</hi> writinges, that he coulde spare himselfe no vacant tyme to read the Bookes of these Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours.</p>
               <p>But to passe ouer these trifles: let vs consider the Argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of <hi>Osorius.</hi> The auncient Fathers doe honorably sett forth, extoll and magnifye the holye Martyres that suffered death for Christes cause. I do know this. I do know (I say) that the bookes of the holy Fathers are full of such commendations and prayses of godly men. So doth <hi>Basile</hi> describe famouslye the vertues of <hi>Saynt Iulitta, Gordius, Barlaa, Mamantes</hi> and forty Martyrs more: <hi>Nazianzene</hi> doth highly commend <hi>Marcus Arethusius,</hi> and <hi>Cyprian: Chrisostome</hi> prayseth his <hi>Babyla: Ambrose</hi> also is full of the like commendations, so doe many others extoll and magnify aboue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> skies such as they accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt prayseworthy. But what is all this to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> purpose? who euer practised to defraude a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny godly Martyr, one title so much, of his worthy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation? Neither doth our discourse now concerne <hi>Saynctes</hi> or <hi>Martyrs,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">It is one thyng to prayse Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, and an other thing to worshyp Images.</note> but <hi>Pictures</hi> and <hi>Images.</hi> Let the holy Martyres haue theyr co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>digne prayses: Let the Fathers be aboundantly and plentifully eloquent in theyr comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>datory Declamations: Yet did all that garnyshing &amp; magnifiyng of Saynctes and Martyrs vertues &amp; constancy tend to none other end, then to expresse vnto vs a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne liuely president, thereby to imitate theyr patience, and to practize their integrity of life: and not with crootching and kneé<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb facs="tcp:3766:427"/>
to worshipp them. Neither was that auncient learned age euer so superstitious and bussardly blinde as to adore and make intercession to men in stead of the Lord theyr God: But woulde glorify their God rather in his Sainctes. And for this cause do I thinke were auncient Monumentes erected, Temples buyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, wherein the Christian people might heare the Actes and vertues of those holy Martyres, to be taught to imitate their example, not because the Martyres that were deade shoulde be worshipped.</p>
               <p>Afterwardes some Portraictes were added perhapps wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the conflictes and intollerable tormentes of these valiaunt Martyrs were curiously paynted: as may appeare in <hi>Gregorye Nicenus</hi> in his commendatory treatise of <hi>Theodorus</hi> the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir,<note place="margin">The Orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory Nisse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus in the prayse of Theodorus Martyr.</note> which labour peraduenture was not altogether fruitlesse ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the capacity of that age: that so by the beholding of the History, and noting the maner of their agonies and passions, others might be the more encouraged to endure the like, as occa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sion should be ministred. But that any <hi>Pictures</hi> and <hi>Images</hi> of dead bodyes were seéne erected in the Churches of Christians to be worshipped in those dayes, vnto the which the Christian people might be so affyed, as to celebrate the dead portraict of dead bodies with more then prophane Religiousnesse, to witte with prayers, with owches and brooches, with sacrifices, with vowes, with supplications, with Pilgrimages, with temples, with Altars, with Capers, with hollidayes, with fasting dayes, with excommunications and cursinges, with intercession, with inuocation, with affyaunce, and hope of assistaunce in the stead of their Christ, or should worshippe Christ in those Images, or by those Images: Certes no man can make this iustifiable, by <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sile, Gregory,</hi> or <hi>Nazianzene,</hi> or any other writer of the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent primitiue Church. No, they are altogether new deuises of this later age, or playne forgeries rather, as hath bene declared sufficiently enough before.</p>
               <p>But take an argument now stronger then Hercules clubbe, wherewith at one chopp he will cutt of the heads of all those I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage breakers ingenerall, so stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gly compact and clowted toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with so singuler a dexterity, that if all the Deuines in the world els hold theyr peace, Images are made so desensible with

this one argument, as shalbe able to endure all the force and counterbuffes of heretiques. For vpon this kinde of <hi>Similitude</hi> he frameth his argument.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>If the dumme Pictures of the Crosse and of Sainctes,<note place="margin">Osorius Argument pag. 197.</note> which did put men in mind of the things wherof they were representations, were so highly reuerenced of the auntient Christians: it was much more conuenient that the liuely Images of Christ should be worshipped.</p>
                  <p>But holy men are by the workemanshippe of the holye Ghost, fashioned to the lyuely and expresse Images of Christ.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ergo,</hi> It remayneth that we geue reuerence and worship vnto Pictures as to the liuely Images of Christ.</p>

               <p>I doe heare your Argument <hi>Osorius,</hi> and I doe aunswere thereunto. And first euen to this whether any dumme Images and portraictes at all were euer erected in the auncient Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Temples, may be with more reason doughted of vs, then Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified by you.

               <p>As for example.

What? would you prostrate your selfe on the grounde, and with cappe and kneé worship the Table? would you bequeath your prayer vnto it, and honour it as reuerently as you would Christ? To what purpose then serueth that which you sing in your Church. <hi>All honour and glory be geuen to God alone:</hi> if you can be conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted to turne that forthwith into a God, whatsoeuer is obiect to the view for a memoriall onely, and to transferre the honour and worshyppe that is due onely vnto God, to paynted puppetts and balde blockes? But now as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernyng the liuely Images of Christ, as we doe not deny that a certeine liuely resemblaunce of Christ doth after a sort shyne in

them, whom the spirite of Christ hath truly sanctified, so do we neither defraude them of their due commendation and prayse: for that were a pointe of singuler impietie, either to conceaue slenderly and lightly, or to speake reprochefully of the notable actes of them, whom God the Father doth honour and sanctifie: namely, sith the very Scriptures are aboundauntly stored with plentyfull examples, whereby we be admonished of our duety that we owe to Gods holy ones.

bestowed much cost and trauayle in the setting downe of a plate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourme of this Purgatory: Whereas also they doe all confesse it to be such a place, as what kinde of thing this <hi>Vtopia</hi> is neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse, where it standeth, or how wide it outstretcheth it selfe, no man hath hitherto described playnely enough to be concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: namely, whether it be an Iland enuyroned round about with water? or an Iland almost enuyroned with water? or a firme and mayne Land? whether it stretch to the West, or bend to the East? whether it be habitable vnder the whotte clymate, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Cold?<note place="margin">What day Purgatory was made.</note> at what instant of tyme it was hatched at the first? when? or of whome it was created? by God? or by the Pope? For if all the workes of God were finished, and at an end the sixt day, and himselfe rested the seuenth day, it must neédes follow of necessitye, That Purgatory must either be contryued within these sixe dayes worke, or els not to be any worke of God at all. Besides this also they can not agreé about the scytuation thereof, as in what part of the world this Region may stand? whether in the round firmame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? right ouer our heades? or in the concauity, or some bottomles gulfe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth? or neare vnto hell in the length thereof? or aboue hell in the height thereof? or leaning toward hell in the compasse therof?

whether before the lawe or in the time of the lawe? or els in the time of grace? how will you resolue me herein good Catholicke Syr, but that ye shall speake alwayes agaynst your selfe? If in the tyme of Nature or in the olde law? how comes it to passe then, that whereas so often mention is made of <hi>Heauen</hi> &amp; <hi>Hell</hi> amongest the <hi>Patriarches</hi> and Prophettes, no sillable so muche is to be found in all that olde Testament of <hi>Purgatory</hi>? Howe comes it to passe that theyr hartes were neuer terrified with the remembraunce of any such place? Agayne how illfauouredlye will this matter seme to haue bene ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dled, that such a skalding Fornace should be established by our Diuines, before any Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall confession, any Masses, or any Romish Bulles were created which might serue at a Pinch, or chaunge those euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting paynes into temporall punishmentes? for that kinde of temporall Censure is by your Catholicke Dyuynes made pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar and appropried to the Sacrament of penau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. But if the fruit of Christes passion did redound aswell to the olde auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Patriarches, and Prophettes, as it doth vnto vs, whereby they might be deliuered from euerlasting tormentes: and on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary part if there be no remedy els prouided as yet agaynste those temporall paynes, but onely the Popes Bulles, surely it had bene hartely to haue bene wished for, that whiles our first Father <hi>Adam</hi> and other sinners of that first age, and long si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thence liued vpon the earth, the same most holye Father Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> the 8. had liued also together with them, who out of the huge heapes of his Pardons might haue released vnto them 8. thousand yeares, out of these horrible flames of Purgatory fire: whereby it seémeth not agreable to reason, that there was any Purgatory as then, when as yet no Remedy was prouided for the mitigation and quallification of those cruell tormentes.</p>
               <p>It Remayneth therefore, that either there is no <hi>Purgatory</hi> fire after this life: or that we must neédes confesse that it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer kindled before the Deuines of this Catholicke generation did blow the coales first in these latter dayes. All which to be farre from all possibility of trueth many probable reasons doe offer matter of proofe. First when as God rested from all hys works the seuenth day, It followeth that this new forged worke of <hi>Purgatory</hi> was neuer begonne by God after that seue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th day,

but made and deuised in the Popes Shoppe.<note place="margin">Whether God be au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of Pur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gatory or the Pope.</note> There is besides also an other matter as full of absurdity as this is. For if God were the author of this skalding house of <hi>Purgatory</hi>: and if it haue continued euen from the first foundation of the Creation: it is maruell how after so long preaching of the gospell of grace, it could be found now first by these Deuines, being so long before hidde from so many great Prophettes of God, so manye Patriarches, Kings, Iudges, Apostles and Euangelistes: or if the knowledge thereof were kept from them, because there was no vse of any such purging, or necessity of satisfiyng by Fyre, before the fayth of the Gospell receiued, then was the case of the Christians much more miserable then of the Iewes and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised people: which is abhominable to be spoken with toung, or to be imagined in thought.</p>

                  <hi>But Luther did say, and that not once onely, &amp; affirmed also that there was a Purgatory: and that he did not onelye conceaue so, iudge so, beleue so, but knew it to be true of a very certenty.</hi> Where finde you this? &amp; by what reason doe ye proue this? <hi>By the place of Mathew which speaketh of the sinne that shall not be forgeuen in this world, nor in the world to come: whereby is to be noted that in the world to come God hath gently reserued a place for many to hope vpon pardon.

So also did <hi>Luther</hi> being once a Mouncke, make for Moncks.

               <p>But let vs seé how <hi>Osorius</hi> goeth foreward: the cause why <hi>Osorius</hi> doth cite <hi>Luther,</hi> is not because he geueth any great creditte to his testimony, but because he may by this occasion bring his name the sooner into obloquye: and withall may make <hi>Haddon</hi> affrayed to deale any further in <hi>Luthers</hi> defence, by this too forked argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t or subtil Sophisme so craftely framed of all partes,<note place="margin">Osor. pag. 198.

But I will not be so squemish about these trifles.</p>
                  <p>I would very fayne learne this aboue all other: whose soules were those that were so holde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fast in prison? Peter will aunswere the Soules of the <hi>Vnbeleeuers,</hi> which were disobedient to the preachyng of the Prophetes.

could be in them?

For in this pointe stic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth all the pithe of dought. <hi>Osor.</hi> is of opinion that these glad tydyngs came not vnto the soules, before Christ had finished his Passion, and descended him selfe downe into hell. But in what sence then doth Peter call them <hi>Vnbeleeuers,</hi> vnto whom Christ him selfe did preache? For there could be no infidelitie by any meanes, where was no preachyng of true doctrine goyng be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: whereunto these soules should haue geuen attendaunce: For <hi>Vnbeleeuers</hi> are not sayd to be <hi>Vnbeleeuers</hi> (accordyng to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of an <hi>Vnbeleeuer)</hi> of that which they do neuer heare, but of that which when they haue heard,<note place="margin">The place of Peter skanned.</note> they will not beleéue. But now Peter doth euidently declare that Christ did preach vnto them in deéde, and that the very same to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the glad tydynges were preached, were as then <hi>Vnbeleeuers,</hi> and thereupon anne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xeth further the certein determination of the tyme. <hi>Whiles the mercy of God</hi> (sayth he) <hi>was looked for in the dayes of Noah and whiles he was making ready the Arke.</hi> Whereby you may easily conceaue, euen by the very order of the text: what tyme that was of preachyng those glad tydyngs. Not as <hi>Osorius</hi> doth dreame: when Christ is sayd to haue pearced the helles after his Passion to them that were dead: but many yeares before that, before the the generall destructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the world by waters: whenas the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of Christ did foreshew by the mouth and preachyng of <hi>Noah</hi> the generall destruction of mankynde, that was then hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng ouer their heades, and did allure them to speédy repentau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in season with continuall, earnest, and most comfortable exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations which they did abuse at that tyme wickedly through vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe.</p>

vnlike to this phrase &amp; maner of speéch, wherewith we are wont to say: that a man is left for dead, not which is dead in deéd, but he that is lyke vnto one that is dead.

                  <p>And this doth Paule fittly and applyably enough, to witte, deducyng an Argument, from the reason which leadeth to the absurde. <hi>For otherwise</hi> (as <hi>Chrisostome</hi> sayth) <hi>if the Resurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be of no force, why are mens bodies Baptized for the dead? for to this end art thou Baptized, bycause thou doest beleeue that thy dead body shall rise againe, and shall not remayne alwayes dead.</hi>

out of Paule, and out of Paules wordes. Now this lyeng So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phister framyng an Argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t out of the wordes that Paule did most aptly gather for the establishing of that Article of the faith, to witte, <hi>the Resurrection of the dead:</hi> doth most foolishely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert, to vphold his peéuish <hi>Purgatory.

Now I beseéche you <hi>Osorius</hi> for the honour of your Logicke, whereas you haue scattered abroad euery where in your bookes so many outragious, madd, and frantike exclamations agaynst <hi>M.

                  <p>You will haue vs confesse that there is a <hi>Purgatory</hi> in any wise. And why so? Bycause (as you say) they that are Baptized, are Baptized for the dead. What els a good felowship, but this baptizing for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dead were to no purpose, if there were no <hi>Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory</hi>: After this maner doth our deépe Logician <hi>Osorius</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude: But S.

To be baptised for the dead</hi> is it nothing els, then to offer a satisfactory Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the body, for the cleansing and washing away the sinnes and filth of the dead? And where be those dead a Gods name? Iwis in the skalding house of Purgatory. Uery well done. <hi>Ergo</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Christ when he suffered his passion, was baptized for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were in Purgatory.

                  </p>
                  <p>I do commend you. But will you heare me agaye? If the death of Christ were vndertaken for them that are in Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, in the maner as you before sayd, then is it a good conseque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t hereupon, that either your Purgatory was vtterly abolished by the death of Christ:<note place="margin">Osorius opinion ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry absurd.</note> or els that Christ himselfe suffered death in vayne. Aunswere either of them which you list. Moreouer if this be true, that your Diuinity doth inferr, that Paule and manye others did dye (as you say) a satisfactory death for the cleansing of the dead, and for the saluation of the whole world: what diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence then will you make betwixt the death of Christ, and the death of those others? Nay rather what neéde haue we of the death of Christ at all, if Paule and many other did dye a satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory death, for the saluation of the world as you say? how thys
<pb facs="tcp:3766:445"/>
your reason and communicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> delighteth you and your Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickes I know not: in my iudgement surely it seémeth none other then, as if any Turke or Iew had taken penn in hand, and of sett purpose deuised to write agaynst Christ, he could not haue written any thing more despightfully agaynst Christ, nor more horribly agaynst the Catholicke fayth: The Lord of his mercye open your eyes, and endue you once at the length with a better minde, if it may so please his heauenly Maiesty.</p>
                  <p>But I returne agayne to the course of your disputation: wherein albeit I seé nothing worth the refuting, yet because you bragg here so shamelesly, that we be vtterly ouerthrowne with your most manifest Testimonies, and that your argumentes are not resolued: I thinke it conuenient to make manifest, what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of argumentes you haue sett downe: and of what force the substaunce of your argumentes may seéme to be. First touching the testimony of Saynt Paule in the 1. to the Corinthians the 15. Chapter before mentioned, where Saynt Paule treateth of <hi>Baptisme</hi> and <hi>Resurrection</hi>: You thinke to haue a great aduau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadge here to build your Purgatory vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And why so? <hi>Because Baptisme is many times vsed in the Scriptures, for Sacrifices and offeringes</hi>: Where finde you that? <hi>Forsooth, where the Lord doth demaunde of the two brethren, that were at strife betwixt them selues, for the chiefe and highest seat in the kingdome of heauen, whether they were able to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the same Baptisme.</hi> In deéd the scripture vseth many times peculiar Tropes &amp; figures: and I am not ignorau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that amongest the latter Deuines, <hi>Baptisme</hi> is deuided into threé sortes:<note place="margin">Three kindes of Baptisme.</note> to witte, <hi>Baptisme of water: of Fire,</hi> &amp; <hi>of Bloud.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit these two latter kindes haue not in them any proper nature of a <hi>Sacrament,</hi> if you haue regard to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> naturall propertyes of <hi>Baptisme,</hi> to wit <hi>Matter</hi> &amp; <hi>Forme</hi> (as they call them) And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore howsoeuer it pleaseth the new Deuines to ascribe vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter of a <hi>Sacrament,</hi> yet doe they not attribute vnto them a <hi>Sacrament,</hi> no nor so much as the name of a <hi>Sacrament,</hi> but <hi>acquiuoce.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">AEquiuoce diuersly sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifiyng in one word or terme.</note> But what doth this concerne this place of Paule ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by you? where it is out of all controuersy, that the wordes of the Apostle ought to be vnderstanded not of <hi>Blood,</hi> nor of <hi>Fier,</hi> but simply of that kind of <hi>Baptisme</hi> onely: wherewith all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:3766:445"/>
in generall without exception are washed through the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne of regeneration into hope of rising agayne to life euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting. Therfore I do here appeale to the Iudgement of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, how blockishly <hi>Osorius</hi> doth wrest this discourse of Paule to <hi>Martirdome</hi> yea much more Doltishly to <hi>Purgatory.</hi> There is besides this an other place cited out of the same chap. where Paule (as appeareth) <hi>purposing to sanctify himselfe not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the dead, but for the liuing also: hath these wordes: Why do we vndertake dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger euery houre? I do dayly dye through the reioysing that I haue of you in Christ Iesu our Lord.</hi> And these forsooth be those substaunciall Testimonies wherewith we are ouerwhelmed a Gods name, accordaunt to the matter nowe in question, as iumpe as Germaynes lippes.</p>
                  <p>It remayneth now that we discusse the substaunce, and pith of the Argumentes likewise deriued from the <hi>prayers</hi> and <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations</hi> of the Church. You do mayntayne stiffely that Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices offred for the saluation of the dead, be very effectuall: which forasmuch as are auaileable to none, but such as be in <hi>Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>:<note place="margin">Purgatory is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed by the Sup<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>plications &amp; Sacrifices of the Church.</note> hereupon therefore you doe conclude, that there must be a <hi>Purgatory</hi> of very necessity. But what if I would deny all this vnto you euen by the same law, and order as you haue propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them? For what reason is there to the contrary, but that I may aswell deny at a word, as you affirme at a word? First as touching <hi>Prayers</hi> which you affirme that the Church is enured vnto for saluation of the dead: If you meane here the true &amp; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolicke Church: You say most vntruly. If you note y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vsage of your owne Babylonicall Te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, it forceth not of a rush what you do there. Neither do I enqurie what you haue in ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dling there, but what you ought to looke vnto, what duety doth exact of you, and what you ought to do according to the prescript rule of the scripture. Moreouer whereas you annexe afterwardes <hi>that these Supplications and Prayers made for the saluation of the dead, are altogether vneffectuall and vnprofitable vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse they be applyed onely vnto them, which are afflcted in Purgatory.</hi> We would fayne learne first how you proue this?<note place="margin">Osori. pag. 202.</note> 
                     <hi>Forsooth</hi> (say you) <hi>because the soules that be drowned in the deepe doungeon and euerlasting darcknesse of hell, can
<pb facs="tcp:3766:446"/>
be redeemed from thence with no prayers.</hi> This is true? and what hereof? <hi>Agayne</hi> (you say) <hi>the Soules that are in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, haue no need of those prayers,</hi> neither am I displeased with this Rhetorical partition. Goe to, what is it that this Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors pertition will conclude at the last? Behold reader now a conclusion more then logicall, wonderfully wrought and called fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> very braines of capacity it selfe: wherby you may forth with note a very disciple of Theophrast. <hi>Damned Soules being in hell</hi> (sayth he) <hi>are not eased by the prayers of the liuing: And agayne the soules that are in heauen haue no need of any supplications. It followeth therefore that there is some middle place betwixt heauen and hell, which we are wont to call Purgatory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As if the Argument were on this wise.</p>
                  <q>

                        <note place="margin">Oso. Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the creditt of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory.</note>If there be no Purgatory the supplicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the church for the saluation of Soules are voyde and vneffectuall.</p>
                     <p>But the Supplications for the deadd are not voyde and vneffectuall.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ergo,</hi> It is concluded that there must be a Purgatory of very Necessitie.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>We are come backe agayne now <hi>ad Petitionem Principij,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Petitio principij, a Demaund back againe of the first propositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> as the Logicians do tearme it. Where one vncerteintie is confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by an other vncerteintie in all respectes as vncertein. For I am as farre to seéke whether Prayers and Supplications for soules departed be vnprofitable, as when <hi>Osorius</hi> doth affirme that there must neédes be a <hi>Purgatory.</hi> And therfore in my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt you shall do very discretly <hi>Osorius</hi> (bicause you are so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapert to write to Kyngs and Queénes) If in your next Letters addressed to Queéne <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> at your conuenient leysure: you will vouchsafe to teach vs by some euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and infallible testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Scripture, how we may be throughly certified of that which you take here for confessed, to witt. That Prayers pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red forth for the redemption and saluation of the soules that be afflicted in <hi>Purgatory</hi> be not vnprofitable but effectuall and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaylable: I for my part, that haue read the whole Bible ouer, can not as yet light vpon any substaunciall or likely matter enough to moue nor co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceaue any cause, why either such as be alyue now should dreadd any Bullbeares of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> or that such as are
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:3766:446"/>
departed hence in the Fayth of Iesu Christ, should stand in any neéde of any pettyhelpes of Supplications or Prayers. For as touchyng the saluation of soules, whereupon <hi>Osorius</hi> doth dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course so largely, I am fully resolued, that the same is singular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and absolutely safe, and shielded in Iesu Christ wholy: &amp; doth not in any respect depend vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any force of our prayers: Neither will <hi>Osorius</hi> deny the same I suppose. <hi>Yet he supposeth that the Temporall payne must be entreated for: And bycause this payne must be endured in the scaldyng house of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, therfore the Supplications &amp; Prayers of the Church are worthely employed to the ease of those tormentes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I do aunswere: if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> soules of the faythfull be afflicted with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny kynde of punishment in <hi>Purgatory</hi>: surely those paynes are either the very scourges and whippes of Gods Iudgement, or els must chaunce vnto them besides the Iudgement of God. If besides Gods Iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, then are they wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gfully punished, but if the dead by the iust Iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God be tormented after this lyfe, then is the promise of Christ false:<note place="margin">Iohn. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>Which doth affirme that they shall not come vnto Iudgement, but shall passe</hi> (sayth he) <hi>from death to life.</hi> And agayne. <hi>My Father doth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hence forth Iudge no man.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke. 23.</note> And what say you to the promise made to the theéfe on the Crosse? <hi>This day thou shalt be with me in Paradise.</hi> So also were that sentence of Paule no lesse false:<note place="margin">Rom. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>We are no more vnder the Law, but vnder Grace.</hi> For what Grace is there, where Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ouerruleth?</p>
                  <p>What then you will say? shall we accompt the Prayers for the deadd vsually powred forth by the Church, to be altogether fruitelesse? First I do veryly thinke, that ye ought not abuse the name of the Church to your abhominable superstitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. The true Church of Christ must be esteémed by the word of God, and his good pleasure, and not measured by mens traditions. Neither is it conuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to colour all such Bastard trinckettes, as are crept into the Church by fraude, vnder the title and badge of the true Churche. But we must make good triall by the touchstone of Gods word, of the meanes, whereby they challenge an interest in the Church. Now to graunt you this much, that Supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the deadd were ordeyned in some places, by Traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of certein old Fathers: yet this maketh nothyng at all to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose

<q>Christ <hi>(sayth he)</hi> was that one &amp; onelye man which could both haue the fleshe of man, and could also not haue any Sinne.

And immediatly after, making a comparison betwixt the afflictions of Christ, and the afflictions of the godly Martyrs.
<q>Christ <hi>(sayth he)</hi> had no need of any our helpe to worke our saluation: but we cann do nothing at all without him, he gaue himselfe vnto vs his braun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, a liuely vine: and we without him can not haue so much as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

Finally although brethren do suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer death for brethren, yet is not the bloud of any Martyr shedd for the remission of his brothers offences, which thing Christ did in his owne person for vs. Neither did he by this exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple as by any speciall patterne direct vs to immitate him, but onelye that for this exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple we should become thankefull and reioyce in him &amp;c.</q>

To be briefe: The Shoomaker was arested by a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieant, the matter was pleaded before the Maior of the Cittie. The Shoomaker for his defence pleaded, that the cause why he did not purchase Supplications and Masses, according to the olde accustomed fashion, for the health of his wyues soule, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceéded not of any contempt that he hadd agaynst any of the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne ceremonyes of the Church, but because he was assured that his wyues soule was already saued, &amp; in heauen, he thought good to abate such extraordynary and vnnecessary charges: and withall taking the Popes Bull out of his bosome, desireth the Maior that it might be openly readd. The Maior doth deliuer the Bull to the parish Priest to read. The Priest seéing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Popes Bull stood still amazed at the first, and a good whiles refused to reade it: at the last being constrayned by the Maior, he didd reade it ouer: assoone as the Bull was read ouer, both the Maior and the parish Priest being throughly ashamed, held their peace.

The Shoomaker was earnest to proceé to Iudgement vpon the aucthoritye of the Apostolick Release, to make it appeare what they iudged now of the soule of his wyfe: whether sheé were now in heauen, or in Purgatory.

If there be no meanes els to reconcile his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor, but by this dayly Sacrifice of the body and bloud of Christ, of what vertue then shall your popish Pardons be? wherefore ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther must your Bulles of very necessity breake their neckes, if your <hi>satisfactory Masses</hi> stand still at the stake: or if your bulles be fatt and lusty, you must neédes confesse that the iolly bragges &amp; bigg lookes of your <hi>satisfactory Masses</hi> will be down dagger.</p>
               <p>Furthermore how will that your infallible Assertion agreé

either with the rule of the holy scripture, or with the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of your owne Schoolemen? For whereas your great Doctours do call this oblation an <hi>vnblooddy sacrifice.</hi> which you name the oblatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the body and bloud of Christ either they must lye, or els <hi>Osorius</hi> must neédes saye vntruely. If the Schoolemen say true that it is an <hi>vnblooddy sacrifice.</hi> I doe demaund them, by what reason it is ministred for the washing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way and cleansing of the sinnes of the quicke and the dead? when as it appeareth by the most manifest testimony of the scripture that there can be no remission of sinnes without effusion of blood.<note place="margin">Heb. 9.</note> Moreouer yf this <hi>vnblooddy sacrifice</hi> be such an effectuall and soueraigne Balsamum for the curing of the festered wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of the quick: for what soares then auayleth your Sacramentall playster of penaunce? For if sinnes be washt away cleane before you go to Masse: to what vse shall this necessity of <hi>Sacrifice</hi> and confession be employed? Doe ye not yet conceiue playnely fine man? into how many monstruous and frameshapen filthy defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, this your friuolous and apish reason would entangle vs? which neither accord scarcely betwixt themselues, and withall do much lesse resemble any countenaunce or shew of countenau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce with the holy Scripture?</p>
               <p>You affirme that you do take vpon you to reconcile the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of God by the body and bloud of Christ: But why do you so loase our labor? For all this matter that you now take in hand, is quite dispatcht, and accomplished long sithence. All the coast is cleare here already: the reconcilement is concluded vpon: the olde rotten wall is broken downe: the obligations be all cancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, so that you neéde not to beat your braynes any more about making any Releases: Gods memory is not so obliuio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, that it can so soone forgett this couenaunt that he made with the late <hi>sacrifice</hi> of his Sonne except you rubb vp his reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce with your dayly sacrifice: Neither is this attonement purchased of so slender force that we neéd to be afrayd of any such breach of coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunt, as can not be continued without your delicate daylye dayntyes. What shall I say of the nature of the sacrifice it selfe? which (though you would the contrary neuer so fayne) neither ought, nor can be handled with any mans handes, besides him onely, who being cleare from all spott of sinne, did deserue to be

But I meddle no more with your vnshamefastnesse: I demaunde touching the matter it selfe, what reason or argument you can make for any your ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary vndertaking this Sacrifice? and I desire to be aunswe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of you herein.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Forsooth</hi> (say you) <hi>because God is wrathfull agaynste sinners and because sinnes do dayly boyle vpp and buddle from without vs, therefore a dayly Sacrifice is very requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site for the obtayning of dayly pardon.</hi> But this pardon is obtayned by our owne fayth in Christ, yea without all your <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices</hi>: or els the verity of Gods word it selfe doth lye surely: and Christ also doth deceiue vs, as appeareth by the promise made vnto Paule,<note place="margin">Actes. 86.</note> 
                  <hi>that they should receiue forgeuenesse of theyr sinnes through fayth that is in Christ Iesu. &amp;c.</hi> How saye you to this? shall we now abandon our fayth, that we may establishe your <hi>vnbloody sacrifice?</hi> for otherwise how can you ioyne the perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraunce of the one, with the maintenaunce of them both? If fayth do obtayne remission of sinnes, what neéde we then your <hi>Sacrifice?</hi> on the other side, if sinnes ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not otherwise be washt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, but by the sprinckling of this <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> then is fayth alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vnprofitable. But you will say, the very same Christ in whom we do beleeue is resiaunt in that holy Altar: Doth he lye their groueling or looking vppward? what say you <hi>Osorius</hi>? But go to what is this to the <hi>Sacrifice?</hi> for if fayth fastned in Christe wheresoeuer he be, do obtayne all our suites at his handes, what further neéde we of him to be sacrificed againe, or of your priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood?

But you will impute the fault of all these Calamities to the disolute lyues, and lycentiousnes of the lay people. Be it as you say: yet the matter rebowndeth back agayne from whence it came.

                     <item>1 First, that which you doe assume of the body and bloud of Christ, is false.

                     <item>2 Moreouer the same whereof you treate so much touching <hi>your Sacrificing,</hi> is as foolish and vayne. For neither was that <hi>Mistery</hi> deliuered vnto vs to that end, that it should be Sacry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed by thandes of the Priestes: but that all the faythfull in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall without exception, should be partakers thereof, and feéde vpon the same: <hi>Eate you all</hi> (sayth Christ) <hi>of this: He doth not say: Sacrifice this ye Priestes:</hi> And I thinke, to eate, and to drinke, is not all one to say: as to Sacrifice.</item>
                     <item>3 Finally this also is as vayne and ridiculous: which you doe more then drowsily dreame vpon: that this Eating should be instituted for the health of all Christian Realmes, and for the reliefe of the quick and the dead. For it was left emongest vs for a Remembraunce of the Lordes passion onely, and so left, not that we should seéke for forgeuenes of Sinnes out of the same: but that these outward signes deliuered vnto vs to Eate, might putt vs in remembraunce of that euerlasting remission of sinnes. which Christ should purchase for vs, by the shedding of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious bloud.

read in the bare <hi>letter</hi> of the holy scriptures, but also to marke diligently the sence, and meaning of the Scripture. In Gene. We heare the Lord speaking, as is before mencioned: <hi>Let vs make light, and light was made.</hi> If after the same maner Christ had spoken ouer the bread: the matter had bene out of all que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion. Now whoso affirmeth that some one thing is an other thing, doth not forthwith commaund the same thing to be made that other thing which he noteth. It is one thing to make, and an other thing to speake and pronounce. Whereof thone is a chaunge of substaunces, thother is a chaunge of names onely. But Christ now taking here the bread &amp; the cupp in his handes, doth not commaund that they shonld be made his body &amp; bloud, but doth dignify the bread and cupp which he tooke in his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, by the name of his body onely: <hi>not chaunging the nature</hi> (as <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odoret</hi> reporteth) <hi>nor casting away the substaunce of bread and wine as Gelasius affirmeth: but honoring the visible signes by the name, and caling it his body and bloud:</hi>

               <p>For it commeth to passe I know not how, that as often as we are minded to expresse the excellency of any notable matter, we doe not accustome our selues altogether to the naturall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties of speéches, but apply sometimes vnproper and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed speéches to make the matter seéme more <hi>Emphaticall,</hi> which thing is vsually frequented, not in sacred Scriptures onely, but very often and much also in the continuall practizes of humaine actions &amp; ciuill societye: Such as haue vsually cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Money the very Synowes of warres: such as haue named <hi>Scipio</hi> the sword of the Romaines, he that sayd that <hi>Quintus Maximus</hi> was the shield of the Romaines: It is not to be dough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,<note place="margin">Tobi 5.10.</note> but by these figuratiue speéches, they did meane to expresse more then the wordes did emport.

Paul commaundeth vs to take the sword of the spirite: which he doth call the word of God. In lyke maner when Christ commaundeth vs to receaue into
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:3766:458"/>
out mouthes that, which he named to be his body: why doe we not as truely and in deéde, transubstantiate the sword of God into a materiall sword, as the <hi>Eucharist</hi> into the naturall fleshe of Christ? If we shall speake after the proper phrase of speéch, it appeareth playnely, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the same death of our Lord, (which he dyed for our sakes) did purchase for our soules euerlasting saue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye &amp; fulnes of lyfe. And it is not to be doughted, by y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Lord himselfe at his maundy before he suffered (foreseéing what was comming vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him) did long before certyfy his disciples thereof by some significant token. But to thend his wordes should be more deépely engrauen into their hartes, he vouchsafed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct them with some similitude of sensible thinges, rather then with wordes: by demonstration, rather then by speculation: set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting before their eyes not onely a denomination of bread, and wine alone, but also a visible example of a material eating: to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct thereby not our mindes onely, vut to endure our senses to perseueraunce much more effectually. And hereof both the cause, and the originall of the Sacrament begann to spring at the first. <hi>Doe ye this</hi> (sayth he) <hi>in remembraunce of me.</hi> Go to then, let vs aduisedly consider what our Lord did in that Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and what the Apostles lykewise, and what we also ought to doe: Christ tooke bread in his handes: he brake the same bread: which bread being broken he offred, not to his Father, but to his disciples, not for a Sacrifice, but for a Remembraunce: not to satisfy for Sinnes: (which could not be accomplished without shedding of bloud) but in Remembraunce onely of that bloud which was to be shedd: <hi>Doe ye this</hi> (sayth he) <hi>in Remembraunce of me.</hi> And this was the whole order of Christ his action at that Supper. what did the Apostles? they receaued the Sacrament of the body deliuered vnto them: when they had taken it, they did eate it: eating it in a thankfull remembraunce of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deémer, they gaue thankes.

Lastly, whereas the sacrifice of the Crosse was accomplished in one place onely at Ierusalem: The vnmeasurablenesse of this sacrifice, which is enclosed within no boundes of place can not be referred vnto that sacrifice. <hi>Well, conclude now at the length.</hi> It remayneth therefore, that the wordes of the Prophecy be construed to haue relatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the sacrifice of the popish masse: in the which christ him selfe being a most pure and most cleane sacrifice of it selfe is offered vnto God e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Gentiles, in all places, yea euen now in the tyme of the new Testament, without end.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I do aunswere: where the Prophet doth name it a pure Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, therein he seémeth to wil nothyng els, but that abolishing all the Legall Sacrifices, which were offered by smoake, by smellyng sauour, and bloud, he did signifie certein other new reasonable Sacrifices, and vnbloudy, as <hi>Eusebius</hi> calleth them: namely spirituall and mysticall <hi>Lyturgies</hi> of the Church, and inward Sacrifices of the faythfull: which albeit do seéme of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues vncleane and menstruous, yet beyng purged and made cleane by the bloud of Christ, are accompted reasonable and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable in the sight of GOD: to witt, by that reason, as all thynges are sayd to be cleane to them that be cleane:<note place="margin">Act. 10.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p>Moreouer where the Prophet doth adde. <hi>In euery place:</hi> as these wordes preuayle nothyng for the credit of the Masse, so doth it extenuate our Religion of the Sacrifice of the Crosse no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng at all.

besides that one onely <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> which Christ alone at one tyme onely, once and in one place, did enseale, and Ratify with his owne precious body, and bloud vpon the Altar of the Crosse.

                  <p>Not much vnlyke to the people of <hi>Israel,</hi> who by the bloud of the <hi>Passeouer</hi> were deliuered from the Tyranny of <hi>Pharaoe.</hi>

                  <p>As touching the necessary agreéablenesse of the things and the Types mentioned in the Maior, we doe agreé together.<note place="margin">Aunswere.</note> For it is vndoughted true that Augustine teacheth in his 10. booke <hi>De Ciuitate Dei.</hi> the 5. Chap.<note place="margin">Aug. de ciuitat. dei. lib. 10. cap. 5</note> That the thinges of the olde Testament be representations of the things of the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But all that which is assumed in the Minor concerning the <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> is of all partes false: both in respect of <hi>Christ,</hi> and in respect of <hi>Melchizedech.</hi> For as much as neither of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did euer institute any <hi>Sacrifice</hi> for sinnes in bread: what then, will you say? did not <hi>Melchizedech</hi> represent y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Type of Christ our Sauior? there is nothing more true. But we must co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and by what meanes this agreéablenes may be corresponde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: In the Priesthood (I suppose) and not in the <hi>Sacrifice.</hi> For comparison is made of a Priest with a Priest: not of a Sacrifice with a Sacrifice. <hi>Thou art an euerlasting Priest</hi> (sayth he) <hi>after the order of Melchizedech?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">By what reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizedech did represe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the Type of Christ.</note> which in mine opinion is in threé re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectes. First in the participation of kingly name: For they were both called kinges of Iustice and peace. 2. by reason of the Priestly <hi>kindred</hi>: whereas both were Priests without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Parentage of whom they came .3. according to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity of priesthood, because the priesthood in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both was w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out beginning &amp; without ending: vnto whom in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Priesthood was ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uer assigned Successor, or predecessor. The playne explanation whereof doth appeare in no place more euidently, then in the very Epistle of Paul to the Hebrues. Which making a collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of many braunches, in comparing the Priesthood of <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedech</hi> together with the Priesthood of Christ, yet in all the same maketh no mention at all of any Sacrifice of bread and wine.</p>
                  <p>But they take exception, and say: forasmuch as <hi>Melchise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dech</hi> was a Priest, by what reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> could he be a Priest without a Sacrifice? And who doth exclude <hi>Melchisedech</hi> being a Priest, from his Sacrifice? But there is none other Sacrifice of his extant (say they) in the holy scriptures, but in the bread and the wine which were offred as ornamentes of his Priesthood. A deép reason, as though he, that so many thousa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d yeares agoe
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:3766:466"/>
was a Priest without all beginning of tyme: did not at any tyme during this whole entercourse of tyme, offerr any Sacrifice vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God besides this one Sacrifice onely. Which being an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable absurditie, yet not to contend long vpon this poynt, I would fayne be resolued of these Catholickes in one question: When <hi>Melchisedech</hi> did offer bread and wine, whether he did Sacrifice for Sinnes yea or no?<note place="margin">Melchize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dech is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer bread &amp; wine for a Sacrifice.</note> I doe maruell what aunswere they will make hereunto. If they say nay: how then did he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figure the Type of Christ? if they say yea. I aske agayne, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Sacrifices that are ordayned for the clensing of sinnes, must be done vnto God, or vnto men? If he did Sacrifice to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, a good fellowship tell vs what had Abraham to doe with our sinnes? Moreouer, I would learne this also: for as much as there cann no expiation of sinnes consist in Sacrifices with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out shedding of bloud: and whereas in all this preparation of <hi>Melchisedech</hi> was no bloudshed at all, what force and efficacy of expiation could there be in that Sacrifice? or how could it be accompted a Sacrifice at all? <hi>Forsooth</hi> (say you) <hi>because these thinges offred did prefigure a certein resemblaunce of this to come.</hi> But what resemblaunce might be there, where no lykenesse could be appliable? If in the Sacrifice of <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zedech</hi> was nothing seéne but bread and wine onely: what is this to the purpose to establish the <hi>Satisfactory Sacrifice of the Masse</hi> wherein is left no croome of bread, nor droppe of wine?</p>

                     <hi>But Melchizedech is called the Type of our Sauiour.</hi> That is true in deéde: But the Type is past, and the veritye supplyeth the place.

                     <hi>Melchizedech</hi> did bring bread and wine into the Armye, which he did offerr to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and not vnto God: neither did he bring bread and wine to be gazed vpon, nor to be worshipped, not to release offences: but he deliuered it to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to refresh him, and his Souldiors, after their long and paynefull Iourney. The same which <hi>Melchizedech</hi> did in the Army, Christ hath perfourmed in his supper: who taking the bread and the cupp in his handes did not offer there his body vnto his Father, but did distribute the bread &amp; wine peécemeale, in the name of his body, and he commaunded them to eate: where is there yet any Institution, or any signification of a Sacryfice?
<pb facs="tcp:3766:467"/>
I doe behold in <hi>Melchizedech</hi> a figure: but I acknowledge the veritye in Christ: I doe conceaue also a participation made of bread and wine by them both: yet all this while I seé no Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. Both of them offred bread and wine to nourish: namely <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizedech</hi> vnto the Patriarche, and to his souldiours, and not vnto God: Christ to his disciples, not to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Father, but vnto men: after the vsuall maner of men that vse mutually to present eche other with giftes. Besides this also the Patriarche with his people, &amp; Christ with his disciples were altogethers pertakers of that which was geuen.</p>
                  <p>Goe to now: and in what sense may all this be applied to the holy sacrifice of the Masse?<note place="margin">No lykenes betwixt the Sacrifice of the Masse, and Melchi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>zedech.</note> Surely if you deriue the reason of your sacrifice from <hi>Melchizedech,</hi> he brought forth nothing but bare bread and wine: but you retayne neither bread nor wine: and in all the rest make no man partaker of your action.

But he was not therefore a Priest, because he did of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer bread &amp; wine: Nor did he geue bread and wine being a King, because he would make a sacrifice thereof: No more did he offer his presentes vnto God, but vnto Abraham: neither yet of any priestly duety but of a kingly magnificence: moreouer he did not onely geue giftes which was the poynt of a princely hart: but he blessed them also: which was part of a priestly function.

                  <p>I draw now somewhat neare to the very Cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the <hi>Masse</hi>:<note place="margin">Out of the Canon of the Masse.</note> whereunto as these godly Catholickes do sticke most earnestly, and do settle in the same the chief prore and pewpe (as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe

is) and shooteanker of their whole Idolatrous Sacrifice: So doe they also in the same shyppe bulge them selues most of all, and with their owne cable ouerhale them selues into an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recouerable gulfe. The Tenor of which Canon is this. <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde these giftes to be carried by the handes of thy holy Angelles vnto thyne hyghe Altar, &amp;c.</hi> What? Can not Christ sitte on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> right ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of his Father, vnlesse he be posted ouer by the Priest, to be transported by Angelles vnto the highe Altar? whenas he hath bene in actuall possession of the highest heauens long sithence, not holpen thereunto by any person, and sitteth on the right ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of his Father, farre surmou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tyng in pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, euen the most excellent ministery of Priestes and Aungelles?

                  <p>I haue passed my boundes somewhat further perhappes in prosecutyng this controuersie, then the proportion of this our Apology would well admitt: But hereunto was I forced, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> peruersnes of Osorius, partly by allurement of necessary persuasion: for as much as I perceaued y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there is no one thyng throughout all the doctrine of this pha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tasticall Religion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our Catholickes doe sweate and turmoyle them selues more greédely, and raunge at riotte more perillously.

Wherein if I haue not satisfied all mens expectation, yet I trust that I haue reasonably brought to passe by this simple discourse, that the Reader may easily conceaue, how peéuish a plattforme this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Peacocke hath forged for his peltyng <hi>Purgatory,</hi> and mumblyng maskyng Sacrifice, vauntyng them to be matters of such importaunce,<note place="margin">Osort. pag. 199. 202. 204.</note> as which the Apostles did deliuer ouer by mouth, and which their Disciples dyd deliuer ouer to the posteritie, and which the greatest consent of auncient Antiquitie with most Religious obseruau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce hath reteyned, and approued so many hundred yeares, with the generall
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:3766:474"/>
Fayth and allowau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the vniuersall Church, without any disagreement. But on the contrary part: as touchyng the Lutheranes, they are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>futed with the authorities of the au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers, and confounded with the generall consent of the whole Church, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Osorius with his copemates haue vtterly discou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenaunced and discomfited with vnuanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shable Arguments, vncomptrollable testimonies, vnrepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueable examples, and conuinced them of horrible impiety and wickednes. &amp;c. In good sooth these be lofty, glorious, &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnificall speaches, but besides the bare sou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de of wordes, no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at all: which wordes if must of necessitie fleé into the Castle of creditt, bycause they be naked wordes onely without feathers, surely you are well furnished with a very ready pollicie of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasion <hi>Osorius,</hi> and with a speciall practize for the speedy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest of the cause. But by this very same deuise of yours, what a singular plattforme haue you layed forth for others to finde out the way to persuade as matter of truth, whatsoeuer they liste to blast out in bare wordes? For what is more easie then to pretend in word, &amp; in speach those two wordes onely <hi>Church,</hi> and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, if men wilbe contented to haue their mouthes choaked with such boanes? If the world be come to this passe, that whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with finest floorish of wordes lauish abroad in the Church whatsoeuer him listeth, the same shall obteine greatest creditt and estimation of his speaches, without yeloyng any reason or demonstration of the thynges, which he vttereth, in good sooth then haue you spoken enough <hi>Osorius,</hi> and crackt the creditt of all the poore <hi>Lutherans</hi> vtterly, as you say. But if in decidyng of controuersies, trueth must be tryed, not w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> bare speéches, but with substantiall matter, certes either you must gett a better vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor for your glorious persuation, or els in my iudgement you were better hold your peace altogether.<note place="margin">The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunces.</note> You doe oppresse vs in a glorious braggery of speéch, with the speéches of the Apostles, and with the tradicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the Apostles disciples: And yet out of all the Apostles writings can not any man hitherto force from you, no not by violence, one title so much, which will auaile any ioate to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> creditt of those your Assertions, but will rather deface them &amp; discouer your packing.

<pb facs="tcp:3766:475"/>
generall consent of the vniuersall Church, cleare from all maner of variablenes and disagreéing. What a iest is this? As though there were any one of those auncient Fathers euer borne as yet, that euer vttered one sillable so much of purging the sinnes of the faythfull, after they were once departed this lyfe: or of the Popes Pardons: of the Propiciatory Sacrifice of the Masse: of Transubstantiation, of <hi>Merite Meritorious,</hi> of <hi>Merite</hi> of <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Now if euer you haue chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced vpon any such Doctrine in the writings of the auncient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, gentle Syr Byshopp, why doe yoe not vouch the same boldly, wherby you may seéme to haue confuted vs, not with bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, but with trueth, and substaunce of matter? But if you haue not so done as yet, nor seéme euer able to doe it: where is then that generall consent and agreément of the whole Church? Where be these Records and Monuments of auncient Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye, and of all foreages? Where be those inuincible Arguments? Where be those irreproueable Testimonyes, and vndeceiueable examples, wherevpon you crake so lustely? perhappes you will empart them vnto vs in your next bookes at your better leysure. For hitherto as yet you haue hadd no leysure to muster y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> your braue guarison that you beare your selfe so stought vpon, and to leade them into the fielde, being otherwise surcharged with farr more weightie affaires.</p>
                  <p>And now to deteigne theé no longer(ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tle Reader) thou hast heard heretofore howe this Portiugall hath powred forth his prattling Rhetorick for the vpholding of his Purgatory, his Uowes, his Supplications, and Prayers for the safety of the dead, and also of that most holy oblation of all other, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the body and bloud of Christ offred for the reconcileme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Gods wrath and displeasure. There remayneth behinde the knitting vp of all this geare: Wherein purposing to make an end of his whole discourse, he rusheth vpon <hi>Haddon</hi> with all
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:3766:475"/>
the bent of his Eloquence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Dare you be so bold <hi>(sayth he)</hi> to call this holynes of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,<note place="margin">Osor. pag. 209.</note> this ardent endeuour of Loue, this comfortable oblation offred, not for vs alone, but for our bretheren also, wherewith we are knitt together in an euerlasting amitye, to be defacinges &amp; disgracements of Religion?</q>
A very hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce verily to call a Boate by the name of a Boate, and a Mattock by the name of a Mattock. But here was one sharde left open which must neédes be slopt vp with some brambles and Bryars. <hi>Is not this foolishnes? Is not this vnshamefastnes? Is not this Madnes?</hi> For if <hi>Osorius</hi> Eloquence were not furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed with these flashing flames, surely it would be very colde. But how more commendable, yea how much more seémely and sittingly for his personage, in my conceipt, should he haue done, if surceasing these outragious exclamations, which preuaile not to the creditt of his cause the value of a pinne, he hadd discreet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and with sober reasons debated the matter first, and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thoroughly whether <hi>Haddon</hi> hadd spoken trueth, or fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shood. If he haue vttered the trueth, then is <hi>Osorius</hi> frendly dealt withall: If he haue spoken any untruethes: there be scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, there be arguments, meéte and couenable Reasons, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with <hi>Osorius</hi> might easily both defend the truth of his Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and preserue it from to be impeached by others. Spightfull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proching, Skornefull taunting, Cotqueanelyke rayling, Ras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>callyke raging, and Barbarous exclaming, further not the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of his cause. If <hi>Osorius</hi> be so fully settled, and so through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wedded to his Church, that no persuasion will seduce him to thinke, that his Churche may straye by any meanes from the right course, and that in all his Religion is no wrinkle or spott, that may be amended, surely he is herein very much deceaued.</p>
                  <p>Conferr who so list the whole face &amp; shape of the Popes Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to witt, his adoratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, his Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, his Masses, his bread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worshipp, his Imageworshipp, his Sacrifices, his Applicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, his Transubstantiatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, his Releasing of sinnes, his Merits, his Ceremonyes, his Pardons, &amp; sixe hundreth lyke papisticall tru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Some Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches do serue for godly and necessary vses: Some are erected to mainteyne Idolatry and superstition: God hath his peculiar Churches. So hath the Deuill also his Chappelles. The Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles had sometymes their Temples for their dumme Goddes.

               <p>And first of all to beginne at the very byrth of our Lord Chryst, what shall we say of the Maunger?<note place="margin">The Maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Christ was layde.</note> which is shewed at Rome in the Cathedrall Church of Mary Maior, notwithout penny crooching?

               <p>The Mounckes of Charrouia do vaunt that they haue the foreskinne of Christ:<note place="margin">The fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skin of Christ.</note> that is to say, the small filme of skynne which was cutt away from Christ when he was Circumcised, and this they know to be the selfe same, by certeyn small drops of bloud, which do fall from it now and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: which albeit carrye no lykelyhood of trueth, yet this might be either beleéued, or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined by vs to be a trueth after a sort, because it is certayn y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Christ had but one foreskinne, if the same foreskinne were not shewed openly for an especiall trueth at Rome in the Cathedrall Church of S.

               <p>No lesse monstruous is it, that at Rome in the Church of Saynt Iames, the Altar is to be seéne whereupon Christ was sayd when he was circumcised in the Te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple.<note place="margin">The Altar whereupon Christ was Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</note> As though in that Church where Christ was Circumcised, were many Altars as there be in the Romish Churches.</p>

                  <pb n="458" facs="tcp:3766:479"/>As meére a mockery also is this, that in an other place of the same City, the Piller whereunto Christ did leane, when he dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Temple,<note place="margin">The Piller where vnto Christ did leane when he dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the temple.</note> is brought forth to be looked vpon: brought vnto Rome (as they say) together with eleuen other pillers out of Salomo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s Temple, which if be true, was done doubtlesse af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Popedome of Gregory.

               <p>It is skarse credible that any dropp of Christes blood which was altogether powred forth vpon the ground, is remaynyng at this present.

For if <hi>Aristotel</hi> did worthely reproue <hi>Hippoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Milesius</hi>: Who being not contented with the present state of his owne Countrey, did practise an alteration of the state: What shall be sayd vnto you, who haue so chopt and chaunged all things in the Church, that there is not left there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in one title so much of Apostolick antiquity, or au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Doctrine? Therefore if all matters must be reduced to the first foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, what one thing can preuayle more to further the Luthera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s desire? who in all theyr writings and wishinges haue neuer en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuoured any thing more carefully, then that a reformation might be had of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Publicke abuses and corruptions of the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, according to the first most godly institutions, to the vtter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolishing of all newfangled vpstartes wickedly supported. And those first Institutions, I doe call the very first foundations of the Apostolyque doctrine, most godlye grounded vpon the holye ghost, and the Testament of Christ. From the which how much your doctrine and Traditions do varry, I haue sufficiently dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered before. For whereas Christ is an infallible principle &amp; ground of the Apostolicke doctrine, and whereas the chiefe pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of the Euangelicall buildyng do stand principally vpon this poynt, to preach vnto vs euerlasting life promised by the freé gift of God, through fayth in Iesu Christ: euen by this one marke may easily be discerned, of what value and estimation the whole state of the Romish religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may be accounted:<note place="margin">The princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and chiefe gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undes of the Popish doctrine.</note> which doth not direct vs to Christ, but to the Pope: not to the onely sonne of God, but to the sonnes of men: not to the worshipping of the liuing God, but to the inuocation of dead soules, and adoration of Reliques: not vnto fayth, but vnto workes: not vnto freé for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geuenesse, but vnto Pardons: not vnto grace, but vnto workes: not vnto the promises of God, but to mens satisfactions: not vnto heauen, but vnto Purgatory: which doth allure vs, not to the spyrite, but vnto the hungry letter, to ceremonies, to written Traditions, and vnwritten verityes, to the bare naked eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of this world, to bodyly exercises, which of theyr owne nature do prenayle litle or nothing at all. If this be not the very natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall power and state of all your Religion almost, confound me if you can: but if you cannot with honesty denye it, where is then
<pb facs="tcp:3766:491"/>
that glorious bragg so often craked vpon of the first principles of your Traditions? which how gaylye are liked and blazed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad by you, let other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> like as they list. Surely I am of this opinion, that there be no surer groundworkes of our Religion, nor better layd, then such as the Apostles and Prophettes haue established: vnto the which if you will but call vs, we will yelde gladly and ioyne with you. But you doe meane some other principles and fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dations I suppose, not such as were builded vpp by the Apostles and Prophets, but such as haue bene inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Mounkes, Fryers, and Noonnes: whose orders and insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions you iustify to be most holy and godly: and haue determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with your selfe, that all thinges which are swarued from thence, ought to be called home agayne to the holynesse of these sacred orders: howsoeuer some particuler Mounckes doe abuse theyr profession, yet you do stoutly auerre, that the first institutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the profession and foundation of their orders doth persist as at the first, and ought not by any meanes be dissolued. This is well. But what if I be able to iustify the contrary, to witt that the very first foundations of those Mounckeryes (as they were erected by the first founders thereof) be wicked, damnable, and to be detested of all christians? Now I beseéch your syr Byshopp for the honor of your sacred Myter, if any man doe direct you to any other redeémer then vnto Christ the sonne of God, or will allure you to seéke for any other redemption then in the most precious blood of Iesus Christ: Doe ye thinke such a fellow in any respect tolerable?

               <p>Loe here (gentle Reader) the substaunce of a most greuous complaynt agaynst the Sacrilegous Englishmen, haynous enough, considering the force of our accuser <hi>Osorius</hi>: which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause you shall not think but that it is in ech respect as true, as it is cruell and odious: and least his declamation may happen to light emongest such as be hard of beliefe, and therefore skarse finde any place of creditt: behold now with what Arguments, with what force, and with what kinde of proofe he iustifieth his accusation: and therewith enforceth creditt, not by reason onely but with aucthoritye: and doth make it vnreproucable by the testimony of an Oracle: so that now no man cann be so distrustfull as to conceaue any ill opinion of the Accuser be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a man vncontrollable. Namely, because himselfe hath spoken the word: euery of whose wordes, be inuincible senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Goe to then, what is it that <hi>Osorius</hi> vpon his superexcellent creditt doth warrant vnto vs? Marke well you wretched En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glishmen, you outcast and abandoned Nation, which haue made subiect to a womans gouernement all holy Church, and all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynesse, re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nonucing the Pope of Rome his aucthoritye, harke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaint, wherewith <hi>Osorius</hi> doth charge you. <hi>Which thing verely I do affirme to be an haynous offence, a beast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and sauadge wickednesse, and a detestable and execrable abhomination.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is enough, for so our Tomme told vs. Neither hath he told it onely, but hath proclaymed it also, and doth so proclayme it, not as the Iewes did sometyme exclayme whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Christ was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused: for they cryed out on this wise. <hi>We haue no king but Caesar.</hi> But <hi>Osorius</hi> pypeth vpp an other note: wee haue no Kyng but the Pope. And as for Priestes and Byshopps to be subiect to a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s aucthoritie, he accompteth it an vnpardonable haynous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, worthy of a thousand <hi>Purgatories.</hi> And I beseéch you Syr, what was there done at Rome, when as <hi>Ioane</hi> an English wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man beyng Pope, all Churches &amp; holynes were subiect not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Iurisdiction of a woman, but were at commaundement of a Strumpett?

<pb n="476" facs="tcp:3766:498" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Popes aucthoritie. By what Argument do you proue this to be true? Forsooth bycause <hi>Osorius</hi> hath spoken the word. But farre otherwise spake, and did <hi>Augustine, Ierome,</hi> and <hi>Chriso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome,</hi> of whom we made mention before. Otherwise also spake <hi>Gelasius</hi> a Bishop of Rome, who doth franckly and boldly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, that the priuiledges of the Church are in the power of the Emperour, deliuered vnto him from aboue. I speake not here of the person, man or woman, nor yet of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> maners of Princes: but of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> authoritie: which whether happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if their prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue be warranted by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ordinaunce of God: there is no cause why it should be defaced for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> peéuish pratyng of one Portingall.</p>

If Christian Kynges and Princes euery one within their owne seuerall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>almes, do as it were represent the Uicares of God vpon earth, I beseéch you <hi>Osorius</hi> what is more proper vnto God, then to prouide circumspectly for the well orderyng and good dispositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of such thynges, as apperteigne to the Ecclesiasticall Iurisdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?

But whatsoeuer the successes shalbe of our hope, it can not be but most acceptable and commodious for his faythfull, whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer his prouident Maiestie shall determine. This one thyng I would wish from the bottom of my hart: that our lyues and and conuersations were aunswerable to our publique professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and that our maners were so conformed, as might no more prouoke his indignation and wrath, then the doctrine that we embrace and professe, doth moue him to displeasure, which one Request if might preuayle with our Englishmen, there were no cause then wherefore we should be afrayed of hundred Romes, sixe hundred <hi>Osorianes,</hi> and as many Portingall <hi>Dalmadaes.</hi> Now the onely thyng of all other whereat I am dismayed most, is not the force of your Argumentes, not the brauery of your bookes, not the crakes of your courage, not the legion of your lyes <hi>Osorius,</hi> but our home harmes onely, our pestilent botches of pestiferous wickednesse, and licentious insolency. Wherein you seé <hi>Osorius</hi> how litle I doe beare with the maners of our people, and how much I doe agreé with you in condemnyng their waiwardnesse, whose maners you do gnawe vpon so fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: whose Fayth and Religion neuerthelesse I can not choose but defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d agaynst your Sycophanticall barkyng, with iust com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation as they do duely deserue.</p>
               <p>But for as much as we haue treated largely of Queéne <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi>: I will now come downe vnto others: and will pursue the conclusion and end of your booke, furious enough, and full of indignation: wherein you heape whole mounteynes of wordes brauely, and behaue your selfe most exquisitely and artificially and besturre your stumpes lyke a sturdy pleader couragiously, and launche out lyes as lustely, yet herein not as Oratours vse orderly, but after the <hi>Cretensian</hi> guise ouersauishely. Of whom
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:3766:511"/>
S. Paule maketh mention. The men of <hi>Creete</hi> are common lyars. <hi>For you say that Haddon dyd counsayle you that you should not meddle with the holy Scriptures.</hi> Which cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sell as neuer entred into <hi>Haddones</hi> head, so neuer raunged out of <hi>Haddons</hi> penne. And out of this lye beyng as it were the coyne of the whole buildyng, it is a wonder to seé, how you shoulder out the matter, what greéuous complaintes you doe lay to our charge: which haue neither toppe nor tayle, foote nor head. I would wish you to peruse the place of <hi>Haddon</hi> once agayne whereat you cauill so much, but with more deliberation. For this was neuer any part of his meanyng to abbridge you the Readyng of one lyne so much of holy Scriptures: Moreouer neither did he so couple you to the Colledge of Philosophers, and Oratours, as to exclude you from the noumber of Deuines: as your cauillation doth sinisterly emporte, without all cause of iust quarrell. For what can be more conuenient for a Byshopp, and a Deuine, and an old man also, then to be exercized in the mysteries of heauenly Philosophy night and day? or what dyd <hi>Haddon</hi> euer imagine lesse, then to rase your name out of the Roll and order of Deuines? But when he perceaued, as truth was, that you did behaue your selfe much more plausibly in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther causes, and therefore highely commended many qualities in you, to witte, an excellency of style: exquisite eloquence ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with ingenious capacitie: stoare of Authours: and many bookes of yours likewise, and especially your booke <hi>De Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litate:</hi> and withall did grauely consider by the conference of your bookes, that you were by nature more enclined, or by Arte better furnished to treate of other causes, then to dispute of those controuersies of Religion: wherein you seéme a meére straunger, and goe groapyng lyke a blyndman, wandryng al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together in Iudgement, and withall a professed enemy to the Maiestie of the glorious Gospell: takyng vpon him the part of an honest friendly man, thought good to aduertize you friendly and louingly, not that you should not employ any study or tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle in this kynde of learnyng: but surceasing that presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous boldnesse of rash writyng, and vnaduised decyding of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersies, wherewith you were but meanely acquainted, that you would with a more circumspect deliberation consider of the
<pb facs="tcp:3766:512"/>
matters, whereof you purposed to discourse: and that you would not from thenceforth rush so rudely agaynst vs with such disordered Inuectiues: which doe in deéde bewray nought els but your ignoraunce, procure generall myslikyng, and auayle nothyng at all to publique commoditie. For hereunto tended the whole scope, mynde, and meanyng of <hi>Haddon.</hi> Which you doe causelesly miscouster agaynst him euen as though he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated with you, as your Catholickes doe vsually accustome with old wemen, poore badgers, Carters, &amp; Cobblers, &amp; the meaner state of poore Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, whom you doe prohibite with horrible manacings, &amp; cruell prohibitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reading of sacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, none otherwise then as from bookes of hygh Treason.</p>
               <p>But in very deéde you doe interprete of the matter farre o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise then euer <hi>Haddon</hi> did meane. And therfore here was no place for your nyppyng Satyricall scoffe which you did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily pyke out of <hi>Horace</hi> Uerses, wherewithall he doth dally with his Damasippus: and you beyng an old and meary concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted man resembling the old dottarde Silenus of Virgile, do ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culously and vnseasonably deride <hi>Haddo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> withall: <hi>The Goddes and the Goddesses Rewarde you with a Barbour for your good counsell.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Horace. ser. lib. 2. satir. 3</note> Nay rather keépe this Barbour in stoare for your selfe <hi>Osor,</hi> and for the rascall rabble of your sinoath shaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynges: who in respect of your first and second clippyng, nyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, shearing, and shauing, must neédes room dayly to the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours shoppes, who also doe accompt it an haynous matter to weare a long bearde, as is also especified in the same Satyre. For you (I say) euen for you and those dishheaded dranes of that shauelyng and Cowled rowte (who with bare scraped scalpes, beyng a new fangled marke of Circumcision, haue glorified your Church,<note place="margin">The circum<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cision of the crowne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gest the Papistes.

               <p>Upon which wordes of the Poet you proceéde forewarde.
<q>But by what meanes doe you know me so well? Who did e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertell you <hi>(say you)</hi> that I haue not bestowed longer tyme vpon the Readyng of holy Scriptures then vpon Cicero, Demosthenes, Aristotle and Plato?</q>
Truly if you perfourme in deéde <hi>Osorius</hi> as your wordes do emporte, you are much to
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:3766:512"/>
be commended. But your bookes declare otherwise. Howbeit we do nothyng mistrust but that you are busily exercized in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng the Scriptures, as your function and dignitie requireth, nor did <hi>Haddon</hi> obrayde you with any such matter, as that you did litle or nothyng at all apply the perusing and conference of Scriptures: and so also did he meane nothyng lesse, then to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidd you beyng a Byshop (as you say) and a Priest, from the study and practize of Gods holy Testament. Wherein you doe vnhonestlye slaunder him and belye him, without cause. And therefore I cann not seé to what end these wordes of yours which you inferre hereupon, and wherewith you seéme to fight with your owne shadow as it were, do preuaile on this wise.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>and Carters to tattle and clatter without Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of matters of Diuinitie? and will you presume to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibite me, I do not say a Byshop, I do not say a Priest, finally I do not say a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> many yeares exercised in the most sacred Scriptures, furnished with no small encrease of knowledge, but as you doe affirme, a man of vnderstandyng and wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that I may not medle with this most holy learnyng</hi>? Abate somewhat of your courage, good my Lord Byshop I pray you if you can. And lett vs reason together vpon some true alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations. Tell vs a good fellowshypp, where? in what place? when? and at what tyme? in whose presence? with what phrase of wordes did <hi>Haddon</hi> euer forbidd you the study of heauenly Philosophy, in speach or in thought? If you can not Iustifie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst him by any meanes: to what purpose then is all this so gorgeous and glorious floorish of wordes about the Mooneshine in the water? But this braue Marchaunt would neédes blaze out his bracelettes and Iewells, lately transported vnto him, from out the <hi>Calecutes,</hi> and therefore on this maner ietteth forth this Buskine Portingall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moreouer by what law? by what authoritye? by what power may it be lawfull for you, being a Cyuilian to pearch so presumptuously, to handle Gods booke? Renouncing the proctorshipp for old Rotten walles, windowes, and gut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, vyle and base contractes, Couenaunts, and bargains, and pleading with pelting libells? and may not I who am
<pb facs="tcp:3766:513"/>
called to this function, to instruct my flock committed vnto me with the word of God, be so bold to employ some la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and diligence vpon the interpreting, and expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereof without your comptrollement? &amp;c.</hi> You haue heard an accusation tragicall enough (if I be not deceaued) and a very haynous complaynt of this babler. For the rest now harken to the Morall of the Fable.
<q>You offer me a double in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurye <hi>(sayth he)</hi> for you doe both entrude vpon an other mans possession: and you dispossesse me from my right with most iniurious prohibitions. &amp;c.</q>
Yea, but if a man may be so bold vnder correction, &amp; by your leaue being so great a Byshop, so wise a Priest, &amp; so great a Clarke, to speake as the trueth is: your selfe haue made two lyes together <hi>Osorius</hi> without touch of breath. For neither he beyng a Ciuilian, forsaking his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng of walles, windowes, &amp; gutters, doth entrude vpon any other mans possessions, nor yet doth force you out of your owne right, nor doth prohibite you with any such kynde of prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: but that you may proceéde in that course of studies, which beseémeth your age &amp; profession best, &amp; bestow as much trauaile thereupon as you can, by all meanes possible. Yea rather he doth earnestly perswade your holynesse thereunto.</p>
               <p>Enioy therefore a Gods name, those possessions which you clayme as your right, as much, and as longe as you may. <hi>Haddon</hi> will neuer interrupt your course, no more will any Christian man els driue you from your interest therein. But in the meane space: lett vs behold what maner of possessions these be whereof you speake? verely if you meane the knowledge of Christ, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word of lyfe, holy Scriptures, readyng &amp; hearing of heauenly Pphilosophye: Certes I seé no cause why you should haue any more especiall prerogatiue in these possessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s then any other:<note place="margin">The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Scriptures doth apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teigne to all men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently.</note> Nor why this treasure ought apperteigne more to <hi>Osori.</hi> because he is a Priest, then to <hi>Haddon</hi> being a Ciuilia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: for as much as by Godes institution, this one learning aboue all other is prescribed to all persons indifferently, as the chiefe and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall rule of this lyfe: vnlesse we will accompt this saying: <hi>Search the Scriptures,</hi> to be spoken to Priestes onely, and that for this cause, Lawyers and Ciuilians ought not intermedle therein. But if it were lawfull for <hi>Bartillmew Latomes</hi> being

a Lawyer to write agaynst <hi>M. Bucer</hi> in matters of highest Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitye: If <hi>Iulius Phlugius</hi> a professed Ciuilian, might be warra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted by themperour <hi>Charles the</hi> 5. to sitt in Synodes and disputations of Deuines: If <hi>Albert Pius</hi> Earle of Carporites writing agaynst <hi>Erasmus</hi> a Deuine and a Priest: If <hi>King Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the</hi> 8. doing the lyke agaynst <hi>Luther,</hi> and descending into disputation in matters of Diuinitye, being neither a Byshopp, nor a Priest, was supposed neuerthelesse to doe nothing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seémely his Regall magnificence, nor contrary to order. Why is <hi>Haddon</hi> accused then as an encrocher vpon other mens pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions, because being a Ciuilian he dare presume to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with a priest in matters of Religion?</p>
               <p>But he should haue yelded ouer the charge of writing against you, to Deuines, and Byshops, rather: Truely it is not to be doughted, but he would haue done so <hi>(Osorius)</hi> If in this kinde of conflict, he could haue bene perswaded, that he should haue contended agaynst a Deuine: But whenas he perceaued by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> course of your writing, that your whole discourse sauored of nothing, but of a Rhetorician, and a Philosopher: and that in your treaty of Diuinitye you alleadged skarse any one sentence of true Dyuinytye, and sound doctrine: he being himselfe a Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torician, and withall throughly studyed in the same kinde of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercizes, did conceaue in his minde, that there could be no fitter match for him, then being a Rhetorician, to deale agaynst a Rhetorician (as <hi>Bithus</hi> did in tymes past with <hi>Bachius)</hi> that so with one manner of weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and one kinde of furniture he might encou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter your lyes, wherewith you doe so nimbly seéke the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of the verytye.

But in the meane space as was most co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for him, and most commodius for you, he thought it not amisse to geue you frendly aduise: according to the sage Counsayle of <hi>Aristophanes.</hi> Lett euery man deale in the matters wherein he is skilfull &amp; exercized: Not because he would haue you estrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge your affection from the knowledge of Gods trueth: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

                  <p>And thus much hitherto of your Epistle, not much vnlyke hereunto are all the rest y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> follow in all your Inuectiues against <hi>Haddon</hi>: which if any man will take the paynes to examine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actlye by the common rules, and principles of Logick, as he shall finde in them many wordes nothing to the purpose: so shall he want two things, chiefly, and especially required in a deuine, namely, <hi>Trueth</hi> and <hi>Charitye.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">What doth want in Osorius bookes.</note> Which two vertues the farther they be estraunged from your writinges, so much the more causelesse was your choler agaynst <hi>Haddon</hi> for his good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayle that he gaue you, and his iudgement, whereby he accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted you more lyke a Cobler, then a foreman of the shopp: vnapt and vnskilfull yet to cutt such large thonges out of other mens leather: And yet meaning nothing lesse herewith, then to dryue you fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> touching y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> testament of Christ, whether because he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued, that the labor which he employed vpon this kinde of exercise was either very small, or altogether fruitlesse: but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing regard rather to make manifest what the right considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that doctrine is, and how much you were short yet of a true and perfect knowledge in the true doctrine of Diuinitye.</p>
                  <p>For if this be a true definition of Dyuinitye, that it be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Gods heauenly wisedome and trueth: what one thing is more contrary and repugnaunt to Gods trueth, then your opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s? wherin you doe enterlace vntruethes for verityes, new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanglenesse for auncientye: mens traditions for true Dyuinitye: None otherwise then as false Pedlers are wont to choppe and chaunge false &amp; deceitfull wares for good, or as some our horse-coursers in England vse to bring into open fayres, and markets outrydden Iades pampered vp in fleshe, fayre, braue and smoathe to the eye, garnished with fine Saddle and trappers, being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise full of windegalles, stuft with glaunders, yelowes, and hundred horse euills, vnprofitable and vnapt to hackney and to draw, or to carry: Sauing that this one difference is betwixt you and them: whereas they by crafty dissimulation, and artificiall Conueyaunce doe beguyle the simple, and such as be without skill: but you (as you seéme) vtter your wares not as of

any sett purpose or skilfull craft, but because you haue no better wares in stoare, and withall seéme not willing to buye any bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But I will presse you no further: onely this one thing will I say: If your industry had bene employed in the study of holy Scriptures, as much as you would haue it seéme to be: truely I must neédes accompt you a very vnciuill and vngentle person, who couering your knowledge as it were vnder a Bushell, will vouchsafe to expresse out of that sacred treasury of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures so litle, and out of auncient Doctors scarse one sentence through out all this your whole discourse.</p>
                  <p>But hereof enough: It followeth now, that I touch some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of the manaces and threatninges of <hi>Haddon</hi>: with the force whereof he would make you dismayd, as you say in these wordes, wherewith you bring him selfe in place speakyng, and threatning you in this wise.<note place="margin">Osori. pag. 216.</note> 
                     <hi>If you be determined to make a shew of your skill, to some of your owne faction, by ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing so rudely vpon vs any more from henceforth.

Further where you declare that it will come to passe that if you happen to dye, there will not want some that will breake of my force.</hi> These be the wordes of <hi>Haddon</hi> as <hi>Osorius</hi> doth cyte them: wherein I doe perceaue, that he doth not conceaue so much as by any probable coniecture, what the meaning of <hi>Had<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> is. For what doe these wordes emport els, then to sturre you vpp, and sett you on edge as it were by this frendly admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, to make you more earnestly bent to the reading of holy Scriptures? that if you did determine with your selfe to offer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny freshe skarmish in this kinde of conflict, you might feéde your owne humour herein as you lifted, but yet you should foreseé to be better prouided with more skilfull, and more warrantable reasons, yea much more defensible, and armed as it were with armour of proofe:<note place="margin">Osori. but a greene soul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>diour.</note> for that you be perhappes to greéne a souldiour as yet, not able to endure the force of this Combat, with so slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der prouision. Well now, what kynde of threatninges be these good Syr, that may geaue you any cause of terror? After this <hi>Haddon</hi> proceadeth: &amp; because he would not haue you deceaue your selfe with this vayne perswasion, as though there were not in England besides <hi>Haddon</hi> onely, any other which in this
<pb facs="tcp:3766:519"/>
defence of the Euangelicall veritye, both would, and could skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully enough encounter with you by the helpe of Christ: herein lykewise hys meaning was to geue you to vnderstand: <hi>That you should finde here in England not one or two onely, but very many, not onely in our Churches, and vniuersityes also, but euen emongest the Courtyers, which did farre excell him in learning and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and were in all respectes comparable with you.</hi> These be <hi>Haddons</hi> wordes: wherein I seé a certein comparison made but no threatninges at all as yet.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore comfort your selfe <hi>Osorius,</hi> there be no bugges here to make you affrayd. And surely I can not choose but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend you for your naturall countrey courage: which lyke a lusty Portingall Prelate, will not be dasht out of countenaunce for any bygge lookes of any of all those men, whom <hi>Haddon</hi> doth compare you withall: And in deéde there is no reason why you should. For why should <hi>Osorius</hi> be agast of seély English dwarfes or babish wretched <hi>Haddons</hi>? And yet though you be without all feare of men, it will not be the least commendation of your wisedome, to feare the Lord your God <hi>Osorius,</hi> and to stand in awe of hys threatnings. For being so studious a Reader of holy Scripture, you can not be ignoraunt of the plagues which the Lord doth threaten to the Enemies of his Gospell: for how sharpely and greuously he will be auenged of such, the dayly and continuall examples of his wrath may be good lessous and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynges vnto you. Lett the recordes of Historyes be perused, if your memory comprehend it not: what happened to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Sigismund</hi> and his whole forlorne houshold, not long after the death and Martyrdome of <hi>Iohn Husse</hi>?<note place="margin">God doth auenge him of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution of his Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell.</note> what chaunced also to <hi>Iulian</hi> the <hi>Cardinall</hi>? and to themperour <hi>Albert</hi> sonne in law to <hi>Sigismund,</hi> after the Tyranny executed agaynst the <hi>Bohemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>? what fortuned to <hi>Henry the</hi> 2. the French King? what al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to <hi>Francisce</hi> the 2. his Sonne? lykewise also what happened to <hi>Charles</hi> the 9? his other Sonne after the great murther and slaughter in Fraunce.

<pb n="496" facs="tcp:3766:519"/>
vnto, I suppose you be not ignoraunt. <hi>Mary</hi> Queéne of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, after she had consumed so many godly Martyrs to Ashes, being first forsaken of her husband, and afterwardes raught a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way so quickly, with such an vntymely death, shall we thinke the same came to passe without some great iudgement of God? Can you tell vs of nothing happening in your owne Countrey of Portingall, after the horrible tortures and execution of <hi>William Gardiner,</hi> which might haue bene a manifest token of Gods vengeaunce agaynst you?</p>
                  <p>But why doe I stay vpon these? when as besides these, infinite lyke presidentes be manifestly extaunt, which ought worthely to terrify you and others also in the lyke. For as for those Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishmen whom <hi>Haddon</hi> doth make mencion of, there is no cause why you should be discouraged. <hi>Especially sithence this litle Island is</hi> (as your selfe doth confesse) <hi>replenished with so many notable godly men, excellent of witt, of learning and of pietye, who will neuer molest you as you say,</hi>

Many Sentences might be vouched purportyng the same in effect: but it shall suffice to haue noted these fewe for breuities sake. The History of the <hi>Galathians</hi> is notably knowen, who beyng seduced by the false Apostles, did not simply reuolt fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Christ, nor did simply aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done their Fayth in Christ, but endeuoured to couple the good workes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beleéuers together with Fayth in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Article of Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication before God for the attayneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of lyfe euerlastyng: On which behalfe how sternely and sharpely the Apostle did reproue them, his owne Epistle beareth sufficient Testimony.</p>
                  <p>But here commeth a Reply by and by out of the same Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,<note place="margin">Galath.</note> where writyng to the Galathians, he doth treate vpon such a fayth as doth worke by loue. Upon this place <hi>Osorius</hi> agreé<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng with the <hi>Tridentine</hi> Councell doth builde an vnseparable coniu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ction of Fayth and Charitie together:<note place="margin">The Triden tyne Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayle.

                  <p>To satisfie this place of S. Paule, here is an easie and a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute aunswere. For in the same Epistle: the Apostle doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour by all meanes possible, to call backe agayne his Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians to the onely righteousnesse of Fayth, from whence they were backslyden: and withall bycause they should not be seduced with a vayne persuasion of counterfaict Fayth, he doth discouer vnto them, what kynde of Fayth it is, which he doth meane. Not the fayth that is idle, and dead without workes, but which doth worke by Fayth (sayth he) And in this respect, it is most true that Fayth is not alone. But what maner of concludyng an Argument is this.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>Liuely Fayth is not alone without Charitie.</p>

If all thyngs that goe commonly after a certein maner together, &amp; be done together must be coupled &amp; applyed to one and the selfe same operation<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by this Reason it must come to passe, that he that hath feéte, eyes, and eares, and haue them not by them selues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, therefore he shalbe supposed to goe not vpon his feéte one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but to walke vpon his eyes,<note place="margin">Onely faith worketh Iustificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but is not alone.</note> and to seé with his eares.

                  <p>Moreouer whereas the Tridentine Fathers doe add fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>that Iustification is not the onely Remission of sinns, but the sanctification and Renouation of the inward man</hi> (To speake their owne wordes) <hi>through the voluntary recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of grace and Gods giftes. &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>Neither is this therefore false, that a godly carefullnesse of
<pb facs="tcp:3766:531"/>
liuyng vertuously is required in the faythfull, which may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude presumption of sinnyng: but it must be considered after what maner it is required. If you suppose it be requisite to the necessitie of obedience: you say truely: but if you thinke it to be an infallible assuraunce of Saluation and eternall lyfe, there ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be nothyng more false and more damnable: for as much as the same is not obteyned by our owne merites, and deseruynges, but is freély geauen to the vnworthy and vndeserued:<note place="margin">When good workes be necessary.</note> and is the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> also geauen, whenas we are founde Sinners: so that in this whole worke, the mercy of the Lord doth beare the whole and full prayse and palme, not our workes, which do but folow Gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation as fruites, and not make attonement with God.

Stand fast therefore, and be not remoued from your selfe if you can, and graunt that veritye may wringe that perforce from you in the matter, that you can not deny: If his blood were shedd for the saluation of all mankynde as you say: if that vnentreatable rygor of Gods wrath could no be pacyfied with any one thing els besides the blood of the Lambe: from whence then is saluation to be sought on our behalfe? or to whom ought we ascribe our sauetye, but vnto this one onely sacrifice? If we be healed by his wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des and bitter bloodshedding, with what shamelessenesse dare your Romish pelting Potticaries presume to apply other rotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> drug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to our soares? to what purpose serue so many Rosaryes and garlandes of the blessed Uirgine Mary? so many inuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the dead? so many Suffrages of Saints? so many Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s?

If it be true, as you doe beare vs in hand, that death is vanquished by the death of Christ, so that now it hath no more interest or tytle in them, or in their lyues which be engraffed in Christ Iesu: wherefore should we Christians be any more afrayd of death, that is swallowed vpp already, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse paraduenture your popishe Archprelates with your outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Tru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>petts doe think by blowing winde in his tayle to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store him to lyfe agayne, which you doe endeuor dayly &amp; busily in deéde, but all in vayne notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding. But now forasmuch as it is certaine, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there be two maner of deathes, thone of the

body,<note place="margin">The death of the body &amp; the soule swallowed by Christ onely.</note> thother of the soule: &amp; whereas also Christ did swallow the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpp both, namely one by his resurrection, thother by faith: vayne therfore &amp; fruitlesse be all your practises, dryftes, &amp; turmoyles, wherein you promise a conquest of death, which is putt to flight already: Agayne if death be not vanquished, then doth <hi>Osor.</hi> lye.</p>
                  <p>The very same may be verified of the kingdome of Sathan, whose whole force sithence is conteyned in the obligation and handwryting of Sinne: sithence also Christ hath victoriously tryumphed allready, both ouer the whole Empyre of Sathan, &amp; ouer all the power of Sinne, as your selfe doe confesse: Why doe you so frett and fume then agaynst <hi>Luther</hi> and agaynst vs,<note place="margin">The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest ouer the Empire of Sathan.</note> who doe affirme nothing els then you doe, and who doe call back all thinges to the onely victory and Tryumph of Christ?</p>
                  <p>Therefore, whereas abandonyng all other intercessors you dyrect your prayer to Christ onely: whereas you doe so highly aduaunce and magnifye the death and conquest of Christ, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in hitherto you denounce your selfe a notable Lutherane: Now therefore from henceforth lett vs as briefly consider of what the very thing is in deéde, which you begg so earnestly of Christ: theffect of your request is, that he would vouchsafe to helpe vs wicked English outcastes. And why doe you not craue his ayde as well for your selfe, and for your natiue Countrey of Portin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall? what moueth you to pray so deuoutly for England perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly by name without any mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> made of your owne Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey men? I doe suppose veryly, because there is no wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse practyzed in that Countrey: there is no sheépe there either infected w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> noysome murrayne, or so tyed by the buttock in bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and bryars of errors, that it neédeth any ayd of the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard. In Portingall groweth no Bruske neither Bryar, no furse, no baggadge, no fearne meéte for fier. Why then reioyce with the holy Phariseé <hi>Osorius,</hi> and geue harty thankes vnto Almighty God, both for your selfe and for your Countrey, that you be not lyke vnto other men, and especially to that most pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous and abiect Nation of England:

For this is a speciall principle of Rhetoricke wherein he is well-beseéne, that if he espye neuer so litle a scabbe in his aduersaries visadge, there shall his nayles be allwayes rakyng: on the other side, if there be neuer so mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>struous a Carbunckle on their owne behalfe whereat the aduersary may take some aduauntage, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will him selfe not take any notice of it, or els will he collour it with some prety shift, or wype it away with some crafty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyaunce and dissimulation.</p>

            <p>NOw for as much as <hi>Osor.</hi> and I haue sufficiently deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted our matters together: It remayneth that I vse some conference with the godly and Christian Reader herein: whom I would aduertize by the way in few wordes, to be well aduised of <hi>Osorius,</hi> not of any malice truely, nor of any vnhonest affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of disquieted minde, conceaued agaynst the man, but moued hereunto, by necessary instinct of well wishing harte, in respect of some young men, not altogether voyde of comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dable know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and learning, though perhappes otherwise not so well set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in Iudgement, who may be easily carryed away into vayne conceipt, allured with the outward glittering brauery of <hi>Oso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> minion Eloquence, as seély fishes caught with sugred hayte, vnlesse they flee the hidden hooke: whom for the same I thought good to admonish before ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d: Not meaning to dissuade them from reading of <hi>Osorius</hi> bookes altogether, nor to defraud <hi>Osorius</hi> of any his prayseworthy grace of Eloquent style, or to extenuate his glory, if he haue deserued any therein. For as for me truely, as I am neither acquainted with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> countenaunce of the man, so doe I not so much regard the outward foyle of his paynted speéch: howsoeuer any man shall streake himselfe with blazing the beauty of fyled tongue, concerneth me nothing at all, so also apperteigneth as little to the matter. There is an other thing that I requier more: namely in a Byshopp, a Priest, and a Deuine. Therfore if any man shall take pleasure in the floo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing forme of <hi>Osorius</hi> phrase, and will not be remoued from the fragraunt flowers of <hi>Osorius</hi> speéch, lett him enioy his delight a gods name, and lett him read his bookes y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> will, yea I doe wishe hartely that all and euery person would reade and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use him, that so the more witnesses there be in the matter, the more directly men may determine of the creditt of the person. Therefore lett them reade him (I say) whosoeuer be so minded, and lett them not onely carry the booke dayly in their handes, but lull him also in their bosomes, I will not gaynesay them therein. This councell onely I geue, that they reade him with Iudgement neuerthelesse, and esteéme of him as a Rhethoricia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and an artificiall Orator, but take him for no Deuine: And that
<pb facs="tcp:3766:536"/>
they become not so rauished with the gorgeous gaze of this prancked Peacocke, nor fixed to faste in the fyne feature of his fawning feathers, but behold below his blacke feéte withall: lett the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be so enamored with the delicate deuises of their smoath Scholemaster, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they geue not in the meane tyme to creadulous an eare to the counterfaicte craft of his proper pack, but haue allwayes in minde the pythy sentence of <hi>Epicharmus</hi> the wise. <gap reason="foreign">

Then which kinde of contagion, as there can be no Canker more Pestilent, skattered abroad emongest y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersations of christian men, so doe I more hartely wish that the vertuous witts of studious youth may not be polluted with this crawling skabbe.

            <p>But the matter goeth well enough on our side, namely, that his raunging speéch is agreable to his disordered profession, and his Lauish style is coupled with his lewd doctrine: for what could haue bene more fitt for this bloudy Religion then bootcher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brawlyng, and currish cauilling, lyke vnto lyke? yet how much more commendable hadd it bene, and withall how much more sitting and seémely his personage and dignitye, if espying any blemish or wrinckle in mens maners or errors, that might haue bene offensiue: he hadd as a Priest, a Deuine, and a By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopp, with friendly and milde application of persuadible Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures enduced the ignoraunt to better regard, by gentle enstruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion rather then with rigorous rayling: and to haue geuen a simple demonstration of the soundnesse of his fayth rather, then haue bruted abroad the beastely botch of his shamelesse impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencye: It is the propertye of vertuous literature and ciuill dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, (so called of the ciuilytye thereof) to reclayme the raun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging riott of wandering wittes to mildenes of maners, and to a certein comely ciuilitye of meéke modestye. Certes this sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uadge sawcynesse &amp; wayward wrangling whether may be found emongest tyranous Turkes I know not: surely is very vnseéme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for learned men, much more vncomely for Deuines, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
<pb facs="tcp:3766:536"/>
blameworthy in Byshopps. Moreouer besides y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rule of Christian Religion, surely reason it selfe would haue required this much at the least, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in reproching other mens faults, such as can not be mindefull of their owne, should reproue no more in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, then such as be faultes in deéde, &amp; not causelesly conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> innocent with forged crymes, and malicious cauillations.</p>
            <p>This also should haue bene foreseéne as an especiall poynt of a graue Deuine, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he that of sett purpose will become a prow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling pickethanke of other mens eskapes, should first peruse their bookes with earnest bent heédefulnes, should aduisedly note the maner of the errors: and make faythfull report of the same ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly: not foreiudging the thinges which he knoweth not: nor carping ouer greédely the thinges that he vnderstandeth not, nor corruptly deprauing the rest that is well spoken. But our <hi>Osorius</hi> here doth inueigh agaynst men, whom he neuer sawe: doth defame their lyfe whom he neuer knew: doth with his cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishe Eloquence gnaw the bookes that he neuer handled: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning the cause first before both partyes be heard: confuting first before he vnderstand what requireth refutation. Not much swaruing from the example of some in these dayes, Uenetians and Italians especially, who being enflamed with canckred ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice agaynst the French Hugonoughtes whom they neuer sawe, being demaunded of their Paramoures, and other vnskilfull young headds concerning the qualyties and disposition of those Hugonoughts, doe aunswere y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they be not men, but certein mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>Furthermore, as though all this sufficed not to procure the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be maligned enough, he hath forged hereunto opinions false, horrible, &amp; blasphemous, which neither entred into their thought at any time, nor euer eskaped fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out their mouthes or writing, which although appeare manifestly in infinite places and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest tokens euery where: yet lett this one be admitted for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples sake.

No in deéde I do not beleéue it, nor doe I thinke it worthy to be beleéued. And I pray you what one of all the Lutheranes did euer dreame of any such thing in his sleépe? or euer taught it being awake? when consciences are shake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with engines of distrust (as oftentimes happeneth amongst the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full being in affliction) whereas the whole force of the mind doth imagine all possible wayes, by what meanes it may counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle the wrath and indignation of God: The <hi>Lutheranes</hi> here haue sett downe a plaister for this soare, taken out of the Phisick of Scripture: namely <hi>Fayth onely, and the merites of Christ Iesu:</hi> On the contrary part <hi>Osor.</hi> vrgeth very stoughtly, that we are

And yet out of this so manifestly false forged slaunder, <hi>Osorius</hi> hath clowted vpp the remnaunt of all his patcheryes. And from hence forsooth are all those so manye huge Tempestes, Lightenynges and Thunderboltes, so many outragious exclamations, tragedies, and earthquakes raysed vpp agaynst the poore abiect <hi>Lutheranes</hi> no lesse vnsauory, then shamelesse. Wherefore I was so much the more desirous to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertyze the godly zealous youth, that they would not suffer them selues to be entangled by any meanes with the flattering faw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>Osorius</hi> bookes: and that they behaue themselues with discrete moderation in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reading of them, least as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Serpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t did once beguyle Eue, they also may be carryed away from the pure simplicity which is in Christ Iesu. God did not in vayne send his sonne into the world, nor in vayne did he geue that especiall commaundement, that we should harken vnto him: Moreouer not in vayne lykewise dyd the Sonne himselfe descending from out the bosome of his Father take vpon him to proclaime the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will out of heauen. If petitions proceéding from harty, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and most pure lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e, if most excellent and vndefiled pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, if most commendable conuersation of life, in all kinde of vertue, might haue auayled to the attaynment of perfection of saluation: I seé no cause to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary, why the heauenly Father might haue taken away that bitter Cupp of heauy displeasure, out of the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of this Sonne. But our woundes could not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise be healed, but by the death, &amp; deadly wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des of the Sonne. The wound was farr more deépe and deadly? then could be cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb facs="tcp:3766:538"/>
by any pollicy, power, treasure, workes or actions of men. Briefly when <hi>Osorius</hi> hath spoken of and aduaunced iustice, and most excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t integrity of life with all the skill that he cann: Yet shall he neuer be able to bring to passe the contrary, but that the song which we dayly sing vnto Christ shalbe an vnuanquishable trueth <hi>Thou onely art holy.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Thou one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly art holy.</note> Out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which what thinke you may be gathered els, but that all other creatures whatsoeuer, adorned with neuer so plausible opinion of holynes, be neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse vncleane and defiled in the sight of God? And yet do we not hereby derogate one hearebredth so much from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grace of God, whose riches and treasure we do confesse to be vnspeakeable, and dispersed ouer the face of the whole earth. Notwithstanding we do also as boldly professe, that this grace wherein doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sist the highest honour of most perfect obedience, did neuer happen to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, nor was euer geuen to any, but vnto Christ alone. But what neéde any more Circumstau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce? I will vrge one Reason agaynst <hi>Osorius</hi> and so make an end. What one prayer can be more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? or knitt vpp in fewer wordes, then the Lordes prayer? Herein I do appeale to his conscience: Let him pronounce the same one prayer vnto God in such sort, that he be not faulty in some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, nor swarue in thought any where fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that absolute perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of righteousnesse, whereupon he doth bragg so much, with such an vnremoueable conuersion of mynde to Godward, and in so humble an abacement of himselfe, and with so dutyfull a reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, as is beseémyng so vnspeakeable a Maiesty. And I wyll yeld him the victory.</p>
            <p>I do most hartely desire and wish vnto the learned Reader and to all other the elect Saynctes of God, whosoeuer do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse the name, and weare the badge of Christ Iesu, that depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from iniquity, and gathering all together into one vniforme agreément of sincere doctrine, by thenlightening and inspiratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the holyghost, we may be all together receiued into that heauenly Ierusalem and into that kingdome of immortall glory, and eternall felicity, which shall neuer haue end: not for the workes of righteousnesse, which we haue done, but for the loue of our Lord and Sauiour Iesu Christ, who suffered death for our sinnes, and rose agayne for our Iustification.</p>
            <closer>Amen.</closer>
