            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

I being in <hi>Johns-ſtreet London,</hi> about the 13th day of the 3d month (called <hi>May</hi>) with ſome others of the People of God, to wait upon him, as we were ſate together, there came in a rude man (called <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi>) with a long Cane in his hand, who laid violent hands upon me, with ſome others, beating ſome, commanding the Conſtables who came in after him; but having no Warrant, were not willing to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, but as his threatnings prevailed, they being afraid of him, joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with him to carry ſeveral of us before Juſtice <hi>Powel</hi> (ſo called) who the next day ſent us to the Seſſions at <hi>Hicks's-Hall;</hi> where, after ſome diſcourſe ſeveral times with them, manifeſting to them the <hi>Illega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> both of our Commitment, and their Proceedings thereupon; yet notwithſtanding, they committed me and others, and cauſed an <hi>Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> to be drawn againſt us, founded upon the late Act againſt <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers and others,</hi> and then remanded us to <hi>New-Priſon,</hi> where we continued for ſome dayes, and then removed to <hi>Newgate,</hi> where we remained until the Seſſions in the <hi>Old Bailey</hi> aforeſaid; whereby thou mayeſt underſtand what Juſtice I met withal, by what went before, and now further follows.</p>

                     <hi>Sirrah</hi> is not a word becoming a Judge; for I am <hi>no Felon;</hi> neither ought you to menace the Priſoner at the Bar: for I ſtand here arraigned as for my Life and Liberty, and the Preſervation of my Wife and Children, and outward Eſtate, [they being now at the ſtake;] Therefore you ought to hear me to the full what I can ſay in my own Defence, according to Law, and that in its ſeaſon, as it is given me to ſpeak: Therefore I hope the Court will bear with me, if I am bold to aſſert my Liberty as an <hi>Engliſh-man</hi> and as a <hi>Chriſtian:</hi> and if I ſpeak loud, it is my <hi>Zeal</hi> for the <hi>Truth,</hi> and for the <hi>Name of the Lord;</hi> and mine <hi>Innocency</hi> makes me <hi>bold—</hi>

                     <hi>ſafety of a Priſoner ſtands in the indifferency of the Court;</hi> And you ought not to behave your ſelves as <hi>Parties;</hi> ſeeking all <hi>advantages</hi> againſt the Priſoner, but not heeding any thing that may make for his <hi>clearing</hi> or <hi>advantage—</hi>The Judge again interrupted me, ſaying,</p>

                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Crook, <hi>The Keeper of the Priſon was ſpoken to, to tell you that we intended to try you this day, and therefore ordered him that</hi> Counſel <hi>might come to you if you would, and alſo that the</hi> Clerk <hi>ſhould give you a Copie of the</hi> Indictment: <hi>This is fair, There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we will go on to ſwear the</hi> Jury; <hi>for the matter is, Whether you</hi> refuſe the Oath, <hi>or</hi> not? <hi>and that is the ſingle point, and there needs neither</hi> Law <hi>nor</hi> Counſel <hi>in the Caſe; and therefore we conſidered of it laſt night, when we ſent you word and did determine to try you, and therefore it is in vain to ſay any thing, for the Court is reſolved to try you now,</hi> Therefore <hi>ſwear the Jury,</hi> Cryer.</p>

                  <p>I hope you will not <hi>ſurprize us:</hi> Then the other Priſoners (who alſo were endited) cryed out (having ſpoke ſomething before) <hi>Let us have Juſtice, and let not the Jury be ſworn till we be firſt heard;</hi> ſo there was a great noiſe, the Court being in a <hi>confuſion,</hi> ſome crying, <hi>Take them away;</hi> others, <hi>Stay, let them alone;</hi> others ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Go on to ſwear the Jury,</hi> which the Cryer in this <hi>uproar</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion</hi> did do ſomething, as if he had done it; Then we all cryed out <hi>for Juſtice, and Liberty till the next Seſſions;</hi> the Court being in a <hi>confuſion,</hi> ſome crying <hi>one thing,</hi> and ſome <hi>another,</hi> which now can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be called to mind, by reaſon of the great diſtraction that was in the Court, neither what we ſaid <hi>to them,</hi> nor <hi>they to us,</hi> the noiſe was ſo great, and the Commands of the Court ſo various to the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, ſome commanding them <hi>to take us away,</hi> others, <hi>to let us alone,</hi> others, <hi>to bring us nearer,</hi> others cryed, <hi>put them into the Bail-Dock,</hi> others, <hi>to put them within the furtheſt Bar where the Felons uſe to ſtand,</hi> where we were forc'd into accordingly; and in this <hi>hurliburly</hi> and <hi>confuſion</hi> that was amongſt them, ſome men were <hi>ſworn</hi> to teſtifie <hi>that we refuſed to take the Oath,</hi> which we never poſitively did; other Officers of the Court, whom they would <hi>have ſworn,</hi> refuſed <hi>to ſwear,</hi> though preſſed to it by the Chief Juſtice, they deſiring <hi>to be excuſed.</hi> Then ſpake one of the Priſoners again pretty much, but could hardly be underſtood by reaſon of the noiſe in the Court, but the People, to whom he ſpake with a loud voice by way of exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, might hear the ſubſtance of what he ſaid, which cannot now particularly be called to mind; but it was to expreſs the preſence and love of God to himſelf, and to exhort others to mind his Fear, that they alſo might be acquainted with God, &amp;c.</p>

                  <hi>Reader,</hi> theſe Notes and Obſervations are here ſet down, that thou mayeſt both know thy priviledge by the Law (which is good, being uſed lawfully) and alſo, what uſage we have met withall from thoſe who ſhould know the Law, and are ſworn truly to miniſter the ſame without reſpect of perſons; But for ſuch Judges to puniſh ſo ſeverely for refuſing to ſwear, and themſelves to be ſo regardleſs of keeping an Oath when they have ſworn, ſurely is one Argument (and that a good one too) to convince me and others of the lawfulneſs of <hi>not ſwearing at all,</hi> would be the heedfulneſs and careful obſervance of them that have already ſworn to keep their Oaths; at leaſt, until this be done, to forbear puniſhing thoſe that fear an Oath; otherwiſe, it may be ſaid to them, as was ſaid in the like caſe, <hi>Thou that ſayeſt a man ought to ſwear, through breaking thine Oath diſhonoureſt thou God?</hi> Surely
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:106889:14"/>
theſe things ought not ſo to be. What a Judge doth, is looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as a thing that ought to be done, and therefore his miſcarriage hurts the more. Beſides, the Judges Judgments become as <hi>Preſidents</hi> and <hi>Records;</hi> and what Robbery is like to that when the Law it ſelf ſhall be made uſe of (by unrighteous Judges) to rob and diſpoil us of our Eſtates and Liberties?

               </head>
               <p>AS to <hi>Law</hi> in this Caſe, for which I am called to your Bar, many things might be ſaid, as firſt to the Statutes themſelves that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the Oath.</p>
               <p>For the 3d <hi>Jacob.</hi> 4. the ground or cauſe of the making that Law was the <hi>Gunpowder-Plot,</hi> as is manifeſt in the preamble of the ſaid Act, in which the Papiſts only were the perſons concerned, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Title of the Act is called, <hi>An Act for the diſcovering and repreſſing of Popiſh Recuſants:</hi> Obſerve, not <hi>Popiſh Recuſants</hi> and <hi>others,</hi> but only <hi>Popiſh Recuſants;</hi> the Parliament intending <hi>them</hi> and <hi>no others</hi> when that Law was made, as appears further by theſe words in the Preamble of the 7. <hi>Jacobi,</hi> viz. <hi>beſeeching your Majeſty, that the ſame Oath may be adminiſtred to all your Subjects.</hi> (Mark) By theſe words, <hi>to all your Subjects,</hi> implyed, that the 3. <hi>Jacobi</hi> was to be reſtrained only to the <hi>Popiſh Recuſants,</hi> otherwiſe theſe words, <hi>to all, &amp;c.</hi> need not have been here inſerted; and this may be further manifeſt unto him that will take the pains to reade the Preamble to the Act, and alſo the Oath it ſelf: The Preamble ſaith, <hi>Foraſmuch as it is found by daily experience that many of his Majeſties Subjects</hi>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:106889:15"/>
                  <hi>that adhere in their hearts to the Popiſh Religion, by the infection drawn from thence, and by the wicked and deviliſh Counſel of Jeſuites, Seminaries, and other like perſons, dangerous to the Church and State, are ſo far perverted in the point of their Loyalty and due Allegiance unto the Kings Majeſty and Crown of</hi> England, <hi>as they are ready to entertain and execute any treaſonable Conſpiracies and Practices, as evidently appears by that more than barbarous and horrible attempt to have blown up with Gunpowder the King, Queen and Prince, Lords and Commons in the houſe of Parliament aſſembled, tending to the utter ſubverſion of the whole State, Lately undertaken by the inſtigation of Jeſuites and Seminaries, and in advancement of their Religion, by their Scholars, taught and inſtructed by them to that purpoſe, &amp;c.</hi> Theſe be the words of the <hi>Preamble,</hi> by which may be ſeen for whom this Law was made, and the <hi>Oath</hi> it ſelf manifeſts no leſs, as may be ſeen in the Recital of it in the <hi>Indictment</hi> aforeſaid; for the ſubſtance of it is to <hi>renounce the Pope</hi> and <hi>Papacy,</hi> and was made on purpoſe to find out thoſe that were <hi>that way affected,</hi> and for <hi>no other</hi> end.</p>
               <p>And whereas it is ſaid, the words are general towards the end of the Act, viz. <hi>And if the ſaid perſon or perſons, or any other perſon whatſoever, &amp;c.</hi> Obſerve, that theſe general words ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to the perſons intended in the Act, and ſignified both by the Title, and in the Preamble thereof, as aforeſaid. The Title ſaith, <hi>For the diſcovering and repreſſing of Popiſh Recuſants;</hi> that general words may be ſo reſtrained in a Statute, hath been adjudged, as may be ſeen in the 4th Book of <hi>Cook's Inſtitutes,</hi> in his Treatiſe upon the <hi>High Commiſſion,</hi> the Queſtion ſtated by him, is, <hi>Whether General words in an Ast of Parliament do include all Particulars, and ſo exclude all Interpretations?</hi> His Anſwer is, <hi>That divers Acts of Parliament which are General in words, have upon conſideration,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>received a Particular Interpretation,</hi> as appears, 1. <hi>Hen.</hi> fol. 12, 13. by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Parliament all Preheminences, Prerogatives, Franchiſes and Liberties, were given by <hi>H.</hi> 7. intailed generally without limitation or ſaving, and the Queſtion was, <hi>Whether the Franchiſes and Liberties of Lords and other inferior Subjects were given?</hi> and it was reſolved by all the Judges, <hi>that they were not, notwithſtanding the general words,</hi> for the reaſons expreſſed in the ſaid Book. So that here is one Caſe wherein words generally mentioned in an Act of Parliament have been particularly underſtood and reſtrained to the perſons intended in the ſaid Act.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>Cook</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Preambles are the Keys to open the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:106889:15"/>
                  <hi>of the Makers of the Act, and miſchiefs which they intended to remedy;</hi> and the Judges of the Law have ever expounded Acts ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, in words to be particular, where the intent hath been particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar: which are the words of the Book. And therefore upon that Rule it is they are adjudged, that where the Statute of the 7th <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. 1. is general, viz. <hi>That if any Treaſurer, Receiver, or Miniſter, Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comptant,</hi> &amp;c. it was adjudged (notwithſtanding the generality of the words) that this doth not extend to the Receiver of common per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; for the reaſons given in the ſaid Book, the Judges reſtrained the generality to a particular, viz. the <hi>King's Receiver</hi> only; becauſe the intent of the Makers of the Act was to puniſh only the <hi>Miniſters,</hi> or <hi>Receivers</hi> of the <hi>King,</hi> and that becauſe of the Stile or Title to the ſaid Act; all which may be much more urged in the Caſe in hand, becauſe the Title is ſo plain, viz. <hi>For the diſcovering and repreſsing of Popiſh Recuſants,</hi> &amp;c. and the <hi>Preamble</hi> alſo ſhewing it to be made upon occaſion of the <hi>Gunpowder Plot,</hi> &amp;c. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for theſe, with divers other reaſons that might be mentioned, thoſe general words before-mentioned (by which we were judged to incur a <hi>Premunire)</hi> ought to be reſtrained to <hi>Popiſh Recuſants,</hi> and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly interpreted concerning <hi>them,</hi> and not to make the Law a ſnare to thoſe who do from their hearts, and with their tongues alſo <hi>deny the Pope,</hi> with all <hi>alliances</hi> to, and <hi>dependences</hi> upon <hi>him,</hi> and that both as to <hi>his Principles</hi> and <hi>Practices;</hi> now to make theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons offenders, only becauſe of thoſe general words, they refuſing to ſwear, becauſe they fear an Oath, but readily and willingly afford and yeeld all <hi>due</hi> and <hi>juſt obedience,</hi> and <hi>abhor</hi> from their ſouls whatever is <hi>contrary</hi> either in <hi>principle</hi> or <hi>practice;</hi> Theſe <hi>Perſons</hi> without doubt were never intended by the <hi>Parliament</hi> to be forced to take that Oath, they <hi>refuſing</hi> in <hi>conſcience</hi> to an Oath, and not becauſe <hi>due ſubjection</hi> is required; Therefore thoſe that puniſh them for ſuch their refuſal, have the greater ſin, for which the Righteous God will call them to account. I ſhall conclude this with a general Rule allowed by all, in conſtruction of Statutes, <hi>Quamvis Lex generaliter loquitur reſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genda tamen eſt, ut ceſſante ratione et ipſe ceſſet, cum enim ratio ſit anima vigor<expan>

                  </gap>e to take it, as appears in theſe words towards the end of the ſaid Act; <hi>And to the intent that due execution may be had of the premiſes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delay, it is further enacted by the Authority aforeſaid, That all the perſons before named, who have any certain time limited or expreſſed when to take the aforeſaid Oath, ſhall at the time therein preſcribed take the ſame, And the reſt within ſix months next after the end of this preſent Seſsion of Parliament.</hi> Note, here is a <hi>prefixed time</hi> for the ſeveral ſorts of perſons to take the ſaid Oath; <hi>And the reſt</hi> (mark that) implying all others whatſoever, <hi>to take it within ſix months next after the end of this preſent Seſſion of Parliament;</hi> but no Proviſion is made in the ſaid Act either to miniſter it afterwards, or to ſwear to any other beſides King <hi>Iames</hi> (as it ſeems) and as by the Oath it ſelf alſo appears; for it is ſaid, <hi>the Oath was to be adminiſtred for the tryal of his Majeſties Subjects how they ſtand affected,</hi> &amp;c. and not to the <hi>Subjects of his Majeſty, his Heirs and Succeſſors;</hi> becauſe it may be ſuppoſed the <hi>Law-makers</hi> intented this Oath to be only ſworn to <hi>King Iames;</hi> for it is no where ſaid in the Statute, that thoſe who have power to tender the Oath, ſhould ſwear all perſons (that were to take it) to <hi>King Iames,</hi> and afterwards to <hi>his Heirs and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors;</hi> for though <hi>Heirs and Succeſſors</hi> are named in the Oath, yet it is no where ſaid that this <hi>Oath</hi> ſhall be inforced upon the <hi>Subjects</hi> to ſwear to any other King after his deceaſe. By all which it may be thought that <hi>King Iames</hi> onely was to be ſworn to by vertue of theſe Laws; for although he that took that <hi>Oath,</hi> was thereby obliged to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:106889:16"/>
perform it both to the <hi>King, his Heirs and Succeſſors,</hi> yet it is no where expreſſed in either of the Acts, that the perſons then appointed to take the <hi>Oath</hi> (or others afterwards) ſhould take the ſame to every of the <hi>Kings Heirs and Succeſſors</hi> as they ſhould come to the Crown. But notwithſtanding all that hath been ſaid, if it ſhould yet be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted that it might be tendred on the behalf of his <hi>Succeſſors</hi> after his deceaſe, yet theſe words are carefully to be obſerved by all who ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſaid <hi>Oath,</hi> viz. <hi>being duely tendered according to the true intent and meaning of the Statutes;</hi> and the rather the Miniſters of the <hi>Oath</hi> ought to be careful in obſerving all due circumſtances, as in the cauſing it to be read at the times of the reſpective tenders, according to the directions of the Statutes (which was not done to us upon our Tryal, ſome of us not having it read to us at all, and others but part of it, and that but once neither) and the more ſtrictly, becauſe the penalty for refuſing is ſo great as <hi>Premunire,</hi> and thoſe other words alſo are truly to be conſidered, viz. <hi>according to the true intent and meaning hereof,</hi> which cannot be ſuppoſed to be obſerved when it is tendred unto thoſe who do yeeld all due obedience unto the King, and alſo do deny the Pope his principles and practices as aforeſaid, and refuſe it in conſcience to an Oath, theſe anſwering the ſubſtance of the Law (which requires obedience to the King) but cannot obſerve the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony or impoſed formality thereof, for conſcience ſake; and in this Caſe this diſtinction is to be kept unto in this Law as well as others, <hi>(viz.) Forma verbalis et forma Legalis,</hi> which is <hi>eſſentialis</hi> or the ſubſtance of the Law or thing to be performed: for, <hi>Lex non eſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſermonam foliis, ſed in radice rationis poſita eſt,</hi> (Engliſht) The Law is not in the leaves of words, but is placed in the root of Reaſon; and if the diſtinction aforeſaid had been obſerved, the Oath could not in Juſtice have been tendred to us, when the ſubſtance of the Law is anſwered, though the particular words or formalities be not kept to, yet it hath been adjudged a good obſervance, as in <hi>Bufage's</hi> Caſe in the 10th Book of <hi>Cook's</hi> Reports upon the Statute of <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. 23. giving power to the Sheriffs to take Bail, &amp;c. theſe three things were alledged againſt the Sheriff: 1. In the Obligation, the Law ſaith <hi>reaſonable Sureties,</hi> and the Sheriff took but one Surety. 2. In the Condition, the Sheriff put in, that the <hi>Priſoner</hi> ſhould appear in <hi>perſon,</hi> and the Statute ſaith <hi>onely appear</hi> generally, without the word <hi>perſon.</hi> 3. <hi>Ad reſpondendum,</hi> when the Statute ſaith only the <hi>day,</hi> not naming to <hi>anſwer.</hi> Yet for all this the Obligation was judged good, for the Reaſons mentioned in the Book. And ſurely, if theſe omiſſions and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:106889:17"/>
additions, contrary to the expreſs words of the Statute, could be juſtly diſpenſed withal, much more then in our Caſe, might our refuſal of a ceremony or impoſed formality be born withall, the ſubſtance being obſerved, eſpecially conſidering the diſproportion of the penalties; the former the loſſe of a ſmall ſum only, but ours the loſſe of all outward Eſtates and Liberties alſo, beſides being put out of the King's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, as our Sentence was: But we leave this matter to be judged by Him that judgeth righteouſly.</p>
               <p>More Preſidents might be urged in this Caſe, to manifeſt the hard meaſure we have met withall, but I ſhall conclude with theſe few Inſtances following. <hi>Vide</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Cotton's</hi> Collections, Records in the <hi>Tower,</hi> 39 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. 1. <hi>That an Oath being the Law of man, ought not to be performed when the ſame tendeth to the ſuppreſſion of Truth and Right, which is againſt the Law of God:</hi> and the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of 28 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. 7. ſaith, <hi>That no man, of what eſtate, degree or condition ſoever he be, hath power to diſpenſe with God's Laws, as all the Clergy of this Realm, and the moſt part of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities of Chriſtendom, and we alſo do affirm and think:</hi> and the Common Law of <hi>England</hi> alſo ſaith no leſs; Dr. &amp; Stud. cap. 3. pag. 6. <hi>Man may only make Laws of ſuch things as he may judge upon, and the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may not be of inward things, but only of outward things:</hi> and the ſame Book alſo ſaith, p. 8. <hi>The Laws of Princes, the Comments of Prelates, the Statutes of Commonalties, nor yet the Ordinances of the Church, are not righteous nor obligatory, except they be conſonant to the Law of God.</hi> And cap. 2. p. 4. ſpeaking of the Law written in the heart, he ſaith, <hi>Againſt this Law, Preſcription, Statute, Cuſtom may not avail, and if any be brought in againſt it, they be void and againſt Juſtice.</hi> Theſe things conſidered, it is manifeſt to every un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced mind, that what ever can be ſaid concerning the Statutes aforeſaid (being but the Laws of men) they are void and null, becauſe contrary to the Law of Chriſt, who ſaith, <hi>Swear not at all;</hi> And if <hi>baniſhing, fining,</hi> and <hi>impriſoning</hi> men for Conſcience, &amp;c. were the <hi>flagellent methods of the late moſt tyrannous times, who had neither Law nor Reaſon to ſupport them,</hi> (as the Biſhop of <hi>Exon</hi> ſaith in his late Book againſt the <hi>Quakers)</hi> Then what are theſe <hi>dealings</hi> and <hi>proſecutions,</hi> and <hi>Sentences</hi> againſt us and others, only for <hi>Conſcience ſake,</hi> becauſe we <hi>fear an Oath</hi> (in obedience to our Lord, who ſaith, <hi>Swear not at all)</hi> and what theſe are to be accounted, and what Law or Reaſon they have to ſupport them, I leave the wiſe in heart to judge?</p>

That which it ſpeaks concerning Swearing in my heart, is according to Chriſt's Command, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 34. who ſaith, <hi>Swear not at all;</hi> and the Example of the Apoſtle, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. 12, who continued in the Doctrine of Chriſt, and ſaith, <hi>Above all things, my Brethren, ſwear not, neither by Heaven, nor Earth, nor any other Oath, leſt ye fall into condemnation:</hi> He knew Chriſt's mind, and therefore leaves out the word <hi>[communication]</hi> implying, that no kind of Oath upon any occaſion is to be uſed among the Brethren and Diſciples of Chriſt. And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 14. 11. and <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 11. referring to the Prophet's words, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45. 23. where it's ſaid, <hi>Unto me every tongue ſhall ſwear, &amp;c.</hi> but the Apoſtle leaveth out the word <hi>[Swear]</hi> as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitable to Goſpel-times, and inſerts inſtead thereof the word <hi>[Confeſs]</hi> ſaying, <hi>Every tongue ſhall Confeſs to God;</hi> as if that which might be <hi>ſworn</hi> to in the time of the Law, is now only to be confirmed by bare <hi>confeſſion</hi> or <hi>negation;</hi> and the reaſon is, becauſe Goſpel-dayes are ſuppoſed to be attended with clearer Light, and greater Power, <hi>that our yea might be yea, and our nay, nay, in all things; for</hi> now <hi>what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is more than theſe cometh of evil,</hi> and ſavoureth of <hi>fleſhly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrust,</hi> as the Apoſtle phraſeth it elſewhere, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 17, 18, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And though the Law made <hi>nothing perfect,</hi> yet the bringing in of the <hi>better hope</hi> doth, and unto this <hi>perfection</hi> Chriſt Jeſus is preſſing his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, as may be ſeen <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. laſt verſ. where he concludes with theſe words, (after he had preſſed them to many things, and <hi>not to ſwear at all) Be ye therefore perfect, as your Father which is in Heaven is perfect:</hi> for the requiring of an Oath ſuppoſeth unbelief in the one party, which is no more to be pleaded for, than it is to be practiſed in a true Chriſtian; for, they that are <hi>truly Chriſtians,</hi> are <hi>Sons of God,</hi> and as many as <hi>are ſo, are led by the Spirit of God</hi> (Rom. 8. 14.) which <hi>is Truth,</hi> and <hi>leadeth them into all Truth.</hi> Much might be ſaid on this behalf, but it being ſo fully aſſerted by divers Witneſſes, whoſe Teſtimonies are publiſht concerning this Subject, for the good of all that deſire to know the Truth, I ſhall conclude with few words, <hi>viz.</hi> That there being both ſo full and plain Texts of Scripture to ground ſuch a Belief upon, as ours is in this point, and ſuch demonſtration of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:106889:18"/>
right Reaſon alſo, it may very well be ſpoke to as a <hi>Caſe of Conſcience</hi> (and ought to have Audience at your Bar) and the oppoſers of it, and the impoſers of an Oath will be the more inexcuſable before God in the day when he ſhal ſit to judge the ſecrets of all men by Jeſus Chriſt, according to that Goſpel which ſaith, <hi>Swear not at all;</hi> Where then will thoſe appear that inflict ſo great puniſhments upon the Innocent, that make Conſcience both of what they ſay and do? and if this Maxime be true, that <hi>Conſcientia errans obligat,</hi> as the Biſhop of <hi>Exon</hi> confeſſeth, how then ſhall the puniſhers of ſuch men (for pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſing according to their Conſciences truly enlightned) eſcape the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Judgments of God? For, if <hi>Conſcience</hi> be that for the ſake of which (and not for Wrath only) Obedience is to be yeelded to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, Then, in true Equity and right Reaſon, it followeth, That Magiſtrates ought not to puniſh for ſuch Obedience as is according to Conſcience.</p>

               <head>Some ANIMADVERSIONS upon the whole Matter, ſhewing the Severity and Unmercifulneſs (if not cruel Injuſtice) of the late Proceedings againſt us; Leaving it to be judged by God's Witneſs in every Conſcience.</head>
               <p>Conſidering our firſt taking without Warrant by force of Arms, and our Commitment thereupon, with the Proceedings upon that Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at <hi>Hicks's-Hall, Middleſex,</hi> by Indictment againſt <hi>J.

               <p>The Court's putting him upon Interrogatories (no Accuſer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing) to accuſe himſelf, in tendring him the <hi>Oath of Allegiance</hi> (as a <hi>ſnare)</hi> that ſo his <hi>Refuſal</hi> might become <hi>a Crime</hi> for them to puniſh him for; carrying themſelves rather as Parties, than as equal Judges between two.</p>
               <p>Becauſe we were ſurprized in our Tryal, expecting that, according to our <hi>Mittimus</hi> and former Proceedings, we ſhould have been tryed upon the late Act of Parliament made on purpoſe againſt <hi>Quakers, &amp;c.</hi> not in the leaſt expecting any ſuch Proceedings as we met with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:106889:18"/>
and therefore could not be provided to make our Defence ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Law; ſeeing we were committed upon pretence of one Law, and proſecuted under colour of another, which could not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out force caſt any face upon us, as perſons concerned to be tryed by it, <hi>viz.</hi> 3. <hi>Jacob.</hi> 4. Intituled, <hi>An Act for diſcovering and repreſſing of Popiſh Recuſants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It further appears, in that our Judges declined the late Act which was made on purpoſe (after the Impriſoning of ſo many thouſand Quakers) only for refuſing to take the ſame Oath of Allegiance, which Impriſonment begat ſo many Debates in both the Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that it may be ſuppoſed they concluded the penalty of <hi>Premu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nire,</hi> according to the former Laws, was either too great and ſevere, or that the <hi>Quakers</hi> (ſo called) were not at all within the intent of thoſe Laws, and therefore they enacted, <hi>That for the firſt Refuſal to Swear, they might be fined not exceeding Five pounds; for the ſecond Refuſal, not exceeding Ten pounds; and the third Refuſal, it might be lawful for the King to cauſe them to be tranſported, &amp;c.</hi> But theſe Judges not liking the Parliaments Act, nor their Judgments expreſt in the ſame (concerning puniſhing of the <hi>Quakers)</hi> have found out a way to make them feel their <hi>little finger</hi> to be heavier than the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments <hi>loyns;</hi> as is manifeſt by the Sentence of <hi>Premunire</hi> lately paſſed, only for <hi>refuſing to ſwear,</hi> whereby they alſo ſlight the King's <hi>Declarations,</hi> which ſay, <hi>That no man ſhould be moleſted, or called in queſtion for his Conſcience, &amp;c.</hi> as they did his <hi>late Proclamation</hi> (when it was given them in Court to be read) which ſaith, <hi>That no man ſhall have his houſe ſearched, or be taken, or impriſoned, under any pretence whatſoever, except by a Warrant firſt had and obtained from ſome of the Privy Council, or ſome Juſtice of the Peace, &amp;c.</hi> But of theſe things the Court would take no notice when they were urged to them.</p>
               <p>Becauſe, when <hi>time until the next Seſſions</hi> was deſired, for theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: 1. <hi>Becauſe the Indictment was in Latine, and ſo large.</hi> 2dly. <hi>There was need of Counſel in the Caſe.</hi> 3dly. <hi>It was to be a Preſident, and therefore for themſelves as well as us, there was need of time: Judges heretofore being careful in making Preſidents.</hi> Unto all which we had this Anſwer returned, <hi>Stop their mouths Executioner,</hi> and <hi>take them away;</hi> and all this when it was the proper time for us to make our Defence.</p>
               <p>Becauſe the moderate Jury that had ſerved upon ſeveral Tryals at the ſame Seſſions were diſmiſſed, and a <hi>new Jury</hi> impanelled only
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:106889:19"/>
for us, conſiſting of ſeveral perſons who had a hand in our <hi>illegal</hi> Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions and Commitments.</p>
               <p>Their unrighteouſneſs is further manifeſt from the <hi>Recorder's</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to us, when we preſſed for time, who ſaid, <hi>they could not grant it, becauſe they muſt deliver the Goal;</hi> and yet ſeveral perſons that were taken and impriſoned upon the ſame account with ſome of us, are continued ſtil in <hi>Priſon,</hi> there being nothing done unto them in order to any Tryal: But, as <hi>Lyers have need of good Memories,</hi> ſo have ſuch Judges of <hi>careleſs Auditors</hi> and <hi>Spectators,</hi> that their words and actions may not be taken notice of. Beſides, at the ſame Seſſions the Oath was tendred to ſome perſons, and although they <hi>refuſed,</hi> yet was <hi>liberty granted them till the next Seſſions;</hi> which renders <hi>ſuch</hi> Judges guilty either of <hi>partiality,</hi> or <hi>injuſtice,</hi> or both; and thus they condemn <hi>themſelves</hi> by their <hi>own ſayings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, That which aggravates their <hi>ſeverity</hi> and <hi>cruelty</hi> to us, is further manifeſt by theſe things following. 1. That none of the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (that we reade of) ever required <hi>ſuch</hi> an Oath of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. 2. Inaſmuch as the <hi>refuſal</hi> of the Oath (ſimply conſidered) doth the King no harm; nor the <hi>taking</hi> of it any good. 3. If it were an <hi>offence</hi> to <hi>refuſe</hi> to take it, yet the <hi>puniſhment</hi> is not proportionable to the <hi>offence,</hi> which by the Juſt Law it ought to be. 4. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, The Oath was not <hi>duely tendred</hi> according to their own Law, inaſmuch as it was not read at all to ſome of us, only we were asked if we would take it? and to others but <hi>once,</hi> and not quite through neither to our hearing and underſtanding, and none of us in words de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed then to take it: He that deſerves puniſhment is alwayes ſuppoſed to have done or ſaid ſome evil; now the Law ſaith, <hi>Malum non ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet efficiendum, ſed deficiendum cauſam;</hi> in Engliſh thus, Evil hath not an <hi>efficient,</hi> but a <hi>deficient</hi> cauſe (ſaith <hi>Cook)</hi> becauſe ſome virtue is wanting.

                  <stage>The next day <hi>Iſaac Grey</hi> was called to the Bar, and asked by the Judge, if he would yet take the Oath? <hi>Recorder</hi> ſpeaking unto him on this wiſe; <hi>Mr.</hi> Grey, <hi>you are a wiſe underſtanding man, and a Scholar; be adviſed what you do, and do not ruine your ſelf, but take the Oath.</hi>

                  <p>The laſt day of Tryal all the three perſons aforeſaid being called to the Bar, after ſome <hi>diſcourſe</hi> between my fellow Priſoners and the Court, my ſelf was forced from thence before I was heard, my fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Priſoners being violently thruſt within the Felons Bar, but my ſelf, by Command from the Bench was not thruſt there, but I deſired to be with my fellow Priſoners, and to fare as they fared, and ſo was put in with them; but after ſome time, (the Court being in a confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:106889:21"/>
and their Officers abuſing my fellow Priſoners, by ſtopping their mouths, and the <hi>common Hangman</hi> endeavoured to gag one of them, that they might not ſpeak in their own defence) Then I deſired I might be heard; upon which the Court called me nearer to them: Then I approached to their Bar, and ſpake on this wiſe, I deſire to know whether, according to the Law of <hi>England</hi> and the Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of this Court, we may not be allowed to put in Bail to proſecute our <hi>Traverſe</hi> at the next Seſſions?</p>

               <p>AN <hi>Oath</hi> ſaith <hi>Cook</hi> (3d part <hi>Inſtitutes,</hi> chap. 74. p. 165.) <hi>is an affirmation, or denyal, by any Chriſtian, of any thing lawful and honeſt, before one, or more, that have authority to give the ſame, for advancing of Truth and Right, calling Almighty God to witneſs that this Teſtimony is true.</hi> And he further ſaith, <hi>No Oath ought to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred but ſuch as is allowed by the Common Law, or by Act of Parliament; neither can any Oath be altered that is allowed by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, or Act of Parliament, but what is altered by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Note, an Oath is an <hi>affirmation,</hi> or <hi>denyal,</hi> which was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed by us: he doth not ſay by <hi>kiſſing the Book</hi> or any ſuch like cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. Note again, the end of taking this Oath, it is for <hi>advancement of Truth and Right,</hi> which is truly done by <hi>affirmation</hi> or <hi>denyal,</hi> being ſolemnly ſpoken as in God's ſight and preſence; and our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyal to take the Oath in that way of impoſed formality (yeilding all juſt and due obedience) did <hi>no way hinder</hi> the advancement either of Truth or Right, <hi>Obedience</hi> anſwering the End of the Oath, and <hi>not Swearing;</hi> and this ſignified by <hi>Cook's</hi> definition of an Oath.</p>
               <p>Again, Juſtice <hi>Crook</hi> ſaith, <hi>We that are Judges ſpeak upon our Oaths, and therefore muſt deliver our Judgements according to our Conſciences; and the fault</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>will lie upon us if it be Illegal, and we deliver it for Law.</hi> (Mark) the Judges Conſciences accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Oaths, is the ground of their Judgments; then is not ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man to exerciſe his Judgment according to his Conſcience, though he doth not formally ſwear? Have Judges only this Priviledge, in miniſtring or executing the Law, and ſhall not another man have the like Liberty of Conſcience, eſpecially when he hath poſitive Scripture on his ſide, that ſaith, <hi>Swear not at all?</hi> And he further ſaith, <hi>We that are Judges muſt not give our Judgments according to Policy, or Rules of State, nor Conveniencies, but only according to Law.</hi> And without doubt, were the Judges, and others, more ſtrict in obſerving <hi>their Oaths,</hi> others by <hi>their example</hi> might be induced to conclude, That there is ſomething more in <hi>ſwearing</hi> than now they believe to be; For unjuſt Judges bring a contempt upon the Law it ſelf, as one ſaid of the <hi>Greek Tongue,</hi> who thought it a mockery to learn that Language, the Maſters whereof lived in bondage: So marvel not if ſome contemn the Law, becauſe the Miniſters thereof make it ſerve to gratifie their
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:106889:22"/>
luſts and evil wills; Theſe (like Spies) make uſe of their knowledge in the Laws, to find out where they may enter, and how they may rob, enſnare and ſpoyl thoſe for whom the Laws are to be as Preſervatives from Violence, and Encouragers of Virtue, and not Nurſeries of Vice, as they are often made to be by the Wits and Practices of Evil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates; that ſo not only, <hi>Ignorantia judicis eſt calamitas innocentis,</hi> but alſo his knowledge is perverted to ſerve his will; And theſe can make Laws to be in force, for puniſhment and deſtruction, but not for preſervation; making them to kill and deſtroy, but not to protect; a thing no leſs horrid and cruel, than if the Sun ſhould burn without giving us light; or the Earth ſerve only to bury, but not to feed and nouriſh us: So do ſuch Judges and Juſtices, when they have a mind to ſpoyl and ruine, no Laws of freedom are taken notice of by them. It hath been ſaid in times paſt, by thoſe who have ſtrictly obſerved former Judges, that they were compared unto the twelve Lions under <hi>Solomon's</hi> Throne, Lions for their courage and boldneſs to aſſert the Laws and Priviledges of <hi>Engliſh-men;</hi> and under the Throne, becauſe of their own ſubjection unto them: But how far theſe reſemble ſuch, who ſate upon the late Tryal, and paſſed the Sentence of <hi>Premunire,</hi> I leave the wiſe in heart to judge, both by what is here preſented concerning that Tryal, as alſo from thoſe who were Spectators and Auditors of the ſame. It hath been ſaid, that the Laws of <hi>England</hi> are like <hi>Hercule's Pillars</hi> that have a <hi>ne plus ultra</hi> upon them, as well as they are Pillars to <hi>Hercules:</hi> But ſurely by ſuch <hi>pulls</hi> as theſe (in cauſing mens mouths to be ſtopt by the Executioner when they are at the Bar to make their Defence, to preſerve their Liberties and Eſtates) muſt needs ſhake thoſe houſes which have no other foundations to ſtand upon. Judges in former times, when there was no Law for Caſes that ſometimes fell out, for bore proceedings until a Parliament was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to make Laws (for it is a higher Juriſdiction <hi>dare Leges, to give Laws,</hi> than <hi>to miniſter,</hi> or <hi>rule by them)</hi> But theſe Judges do ſhew diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like unto the Laws already made, and that lately too, and on purpoſe againſt thoſe perſons called <hi>Quakers,</hi> that deny all Oaths: which Act of Parliament ſets down what Fine ſhall be impoſed, and no more, and all the Penalties for the firſt, ſecond and third Offences: But theſe Judges, for the firſt Offence (and that created by themſelves too) <hi>will have all but Life,</hi> as themſelves ſaid; and that too, to live in penu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and miſery, the <hi>means of livelihood</hi> by their Sentence being to be
taken away. Surely if the Law of <hi>England</hi> be a <hi>merciful Law,</hi> as they ſaid it is, then they muſt needs be moſt <hi>unmerciful Judges</hi> who paſſed
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:106889:22"/>
ſo ſevere a Sentence, drawn from ſuch <hi>merciful Laws</hi> as they ſaid the Laws of <hi>England</hi> are; And ſurely in this, the Judges make their <hi>little finger</hi> (as was ſaid) heavier than the late <hi>Parliaments loyns</hi> But as Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution is the Life of the Law, ſo the application of it to a proper ſubject, is the feet upon which it is to go: and if this Rule had been obſerved, <hi>Popiſh Recuſants</hi> (&amp; not <hi>true Proteſtants)</hi> would have bin found to have been the perſons intended in the Statutes of King <hi>James,</hi> as aforeſaid. But through male-adminiſtration of Laws (oft-times) thoſe are moſt hurt by them, for whom they were not made; and ſo comes <hi>Judgment to be turned backward,</hi> and <hi>Equity to fall in the ſtreets;</hi> and this made the Prophet take up a lamentation and ſay, <hi>Wo is me, for I am as when they have gathered the Summer fruits, as the Grape-gleanings of the Vintage,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The good man is periſhed out of the Earth, and there is none upright amongst men; they all lie in wait for blood: they hunt every man for his brother with a net,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Mic.</hi> 7. 1, 2, 3, 4. And was it not thus when they ſought to entrap the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> but could find nothing againſt him, <hi>ſave in the matters of his God.</hi> And this was the controverſie in the Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi>'s time, chap. 5. 1. <hi>Hear ye this O Prieſts, and hearken ye houſe of Iſrael, and give ear O houſe of the King; for Judgment is towards you; becauſe ye have been a ſnare upon</hi> Mizpah, <hi>and a net ſpread upon</hi> Tabor. And was it not the practice in thoſe perſecuting dayes mentioned in the Book of Martyrs, that when no ſnare nor net would do, then this was the queſtion to them, <hi>What ſay you to the Sacrament of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar?</hi> and by this, when all failed, they were ſure to catch them. The like uſe, by the Powers that are gone, was made of the <hi>Engagement,</hi> and the <hi>Oath of Abjuration,</hi> and is now made of the <hi>Oath of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance,</hi> by malicious Magiſtrates, who when they can find no way to execute their Cruelty upon the poor People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> then they cry, <hi>Give them the Oath,</hi> and this is ſo frequent, that they tender it at their pleaſure, and to whom they have a mind, knowing when all ſnares fail, they can ſurely catch them in this; or, if all other Laws be but like Rods of wire, and the Judges or Juſtices have a mind to whip a man ſoundly, then they will at their pleaſure, tender the <hi>Oath,</hi> and the <hi>refuſal</hi> thereof they will make to be as <hi>Scorpions,</hi> by paſſing the Sentence of <hi>Premunire</hi> againſt them. What man can be ſafe while Judges and Juſtices take this liberty to themſelves, to decline Laws of ſafety and moderation, and pick out at their pleaſure Laws of Cruelty, and make whom they pleaſe to be concerned therein?
