         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>A Reply to a book ſet forth by ſome Prieſts about <hi>Beverley,</hi> whoſe names I do finde ſubſcribed to it, who ſaith, <hi>The light in man before faith is not pure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The law is juſt, holy and good; and what is holy, is pure; what is juſt, is pure; what is good, is pure; what is perfect, is pure: which Law is the Schoolmaſter until faith, &amp; after faith is come we are no longer under a Schoolmaſter, and this is witneſſed amongſt as. And this you Prieſts about <hi>Beverley,</hi> ſay is not pure. <hi>Joſ. Bellet, Joh. Pomrey, Paul Gliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Chriſtoph. Feake, Jo. Simpſom, Geo. Cockin, Law. wyſe,</hi> I charge you &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand you give over deceiving the people, you ſeven, who are perfect in iniquity without the Law of God. And <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaw Chriſt, &amp; wrote of him: that which ſaw him was pure, and is pure. And here you have ſhewed forth your ignorance and blinde judgement, and not knowing neither Law nor Faith: for the truths ſake have I replied to your book of errors, who is in the light of Chriſt, which lets me ſee the Law, and the Schoolmaſter both. And you which ſay you were not ſent immediately, as the Apoſtles were, with the immediate which ſent them, are you all judged, <hi>Joſeph Kellet, John Pomrey, Paul Gliſſon, Christopher Feake, Jo. Simpſon, George Cockin, Law. Wyſe,</hi> which is ſeven, perfection, perfect in the myſtery of iniquity, acting againſt the myſtery of godlineſs, you are the beaſt which ſtands upon the ſea with your ſeven heads, and upon your heads the names of blaſphemy, who are out of the Apoſtles doctrine and life, that ſay the light before faith is not pure, whoſe mouths are opened with blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy againſt God, and his Name, and his Tabernacle, which is with men, the light which diſcovers ſin and evil, you are ſeen, that ſuch as you might be more manifeſt with it, which are manifeſt now to all the children of light, and the children of the day; praiſes, praiſes be to the Lord God for ever: for that which ſhews ſin, is eternal, and is pure, and that which is before Faith, is perfect, juſt, holy, good and pure, and it is written, The Law is the Schoolmaſter till Faith, and that we own in its place, which is juſt, holy, good and ſpiritual: and you which owns not God, owns not Faith nor the Law to be pure, for the Law hath domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on over a man as long as he lives, which you <hi>Joſeph Kellet, John Pomrey, Paul Gliſſon, Chriſtopher Feake, Jo. Simpſon, Geo. Cockin, Law. Wyſe,</hi> have cleared your ſelves to be without Law, and Faith, and both, and ſo you are not fit to teach others: ſo it is you that have ſlandered the innocent to have laid waſte the Scriptures, when you are they that have laid waſte the Scriptures your ſelves, Chriſt, the Church, Faith, and Hope, and the Law, which ſtumbles at the light: ſo the righteous Judge of Heaven and Earth doth return a righteous judgement upon you unrighteous judges: ſo in righteouſneſs doth he ſet the innocent free. To you all, this is the word of God.</p>
            <p>This is the word of the Lord to you that have ſubſcribed your names to the book, whoſe folly in it (out of you) hath appeared, and to be viewed,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:118845:3"/>
with the children of light it is ſeen, and your nakedneſs, and where you are who doth conclude the Light before Faith is not pure, and who doth ſay, God doth not ſend Teachers and Paſtors, and Elders immediately forth now, as he did the Apoſtles. And here you are concluded to be without the immediate life, as the Apoſtles were in, who were ſent imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from God. See the miſerable eſtate and condition you are in: and with the immediate life you are judged, who have profeſſed your ſelves to be teachers to others, and guides to others, which hath gone on in ſuch ſtrains, and preſumptuouſly judgeth the innocent; but God who is immediate ſees you all, and from him you all have your reward, and your judgement which is eternal, to that light in your conſciences I ſpeak, which ſhall be your condemnation eternally which hate it, and ſtumble at it, and it will witneſs me, when the book of conſcience is opened, and it you have condemned.</p>
            <p>And to all people that have a love to Chriſt, which love this light that thoſe before mentioned do ſtumble at; it is it that will lead up to witneſs Faith; it is it that will lead you up to witneſs the Anointing; it is it that will lead you to witneſs Hope; it is it will lead you to witneſs Chriſt the Head<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to know all the Saints which have unity in the light, and ſo not to ſtumble at the words that proceeds from the light; but with the light waiting upon God the Father of light, with the light the Scriptures will be opened to you, there is your teacher, The light, if you walk in it, you will not ſtumble, but have the light of life; and if you hate it, it ſhall be your condemnation eternally. You ſhall witneſs what I ſpeak, for to that in every mans conſcience I ſpeak, which if you love the light that Chriſt hath enlightned you withal, it will guide your hearts together, to hold the Head; which if you hate this light, you hold not the Head, and all that ever you act or ſpeak, is in the invention of your own work: ſo you are condemned with the light. To the light in every ones conſcience I ſpeak, which ſhall witneſs me when the book of conſcience is opened, and all things judged with it and out of it. This is to all them that the Prieſts calls brethren, to take heed to the light within them, which Chriſt hath enlightned them withal, that with it they may ſee all them, that ſtumble at it, and hate it, which are to be condemned with it. To you, this is the word of the Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prieſt.</hi> Somthing in reply to that which you do conclude, as firſt, to awaken your ſouls that are apt to ſlumber, to take heed of the evil of the times, pride, covetouſneſs, formality, which theſe clamour againſt, which you call Quakers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> Here you own their doctrine you call Quakers, and with it you ſee your ſelves, and what ſtate you live in; and yet in Page 52. you ſay, Go not after them: hath their doctrine ſtirr'd you up, and let you ſee your pride, formality, and oppreſſion, and ſlumber? and that which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims againſt theſe, you ſay go not after.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prieſt.</hi> Another falſe ſlander that you <hi>Joſeph Kellet, John Pomrey, Paul

Gliſſon,</hi> and the reſt charge upon them you call Quakers, that they bring an odium upon the glorious affairs of Chriſts kingdom.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> This ſhall ſtand for your ſelves, who live in experiences, which the Miniſter of Chriſt taught to forget the things paſt, and to preſs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; and there you do ſhew that you are raced out from the life of the Apoſtle, and layes waſte his words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prieſt.</hi> Another of your lying ſlanders is, that you ſay, They lay waſte Churches, Graces, Scriptures, Principles.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> And in theſe I charge you, <hi>Joſeph Kellet, John Pomrey, Paul Gliſſon</hi> to be lyers; for the Churches of the Saints, Graces, Scriptures, Principles we own; but you ſlander us, becauſe we deny the Steeple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe to be the Church; and the Grace of God we own, which teacheth to deny all ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, and ſo it is in the firſt leſſon, That they do come to ſee with the light of Chriſt to deny your Church, your Principle, your Experiences, and ſo are not to taſte of their doctrine which periſh with the uſing of it; for you have been the proud and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, that have led ſilly women captive, which have been ever learning, but never able to know the truth of you. And ſome are moved to come and cry againſt you, therefore ſlander them not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prieſt.</hi> Another lying ſlander you bring, ſaying, They hinder the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of the Goſpel, by weakening the hands of faithful teachers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> Theſe are more of your lyes, for the progreſs of the Goſpel we own, and the faithful teachers we own; but ſuch as you Prieſts, who ſay you are not ſent immediately, as the Apoſtles were, we deny.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prieſt.</hi> You are making a Phariſees confeſſion, you Prieſts, and are learning your leſſon, how you are apt to ſlumber, and how you ſhould be ſtirr'd up, and doth confeſs that your people are in deadneſs of their hearts, occaſioned by formal duties.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> Here you have uttered where you are, which makes people forſake you, and where one doth, ten ſhall, and ſee your prayers empty without the Spirit, and this is to your Phariſees confeſſion of your ſelves and the people; and many doth ſee that the Lord is gone out of your publick aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, and that Miniſtery he doth not own; for you are ſuch as the Lord cried wo againſt, as ſtood praying in the Synagogues, &amp;c. <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. and there you are all openly ſhewed to be none of Chriſts ſending, neither your Church none of his Body; for when the Lord hath moved ſome to come to ſpeak after the order of the Saints Churches and the Scriptures. Some have been ſtocked, ſome ſtoned, and beat, and priſoned. And how can you ſay, This is a Church of God, but blaſpheme God? but it is as the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Become a cage of unclean birds.</hi> And, as touching the Saints conditions Hope &amp; Faith, I charge you let them alone, and meddle not with them, for them you know nothing of; for your Faith is vain, and your Hope ſhall periſh: and to you this is the word of God, who ſtumbles at the light.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Priest.</hi> And again you ſay, Take heed of judging Ordinances, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary or indifferent things.</p>

               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:118845:4"/>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> And here I charge you to keep people in blindneſs, who put no difference between the Ordinances of Chriſt, and the Ordinances of Men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prieſt.</hi> And again you cavil, becauſe they ſay, Minde the light in you, which is Chriſt, and is pure, and that it diſcovers every evil: and your An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to this is, Whether makes not this the Scripture unnceſſary, and caſts off all outward teachings.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> O you blinde guides! this light which is to be minded, which is Chriſt, ſtabliſheth the Scriptures, and it doth bring to deny all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward teachers which is made by man: for, <hi>What is the chaff to the wheat?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prieſt.</hi> And again you Query, Whether this brings not down the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious myſtery of the Scriptures, and from every rule of duty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> Here you have declared you know nothing of the myſtery of the Scriptures, but are in your own duties; for the light within, which ſhews him ſin, and every evil, it doth teach him how to pray and watch, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poneth to him every myſtery of the Scripture, and without it you are all blinde, and know nothing of the myſtery, as you make it appear: and you ſlanderers, do not incenſe the people, that we deny the Scriptures; for the Scriptures is ours.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prieſt.</hi> And in your p. 2. whereof you are tormented, and ſaith, We ſit inthe chair of judgement. I anſwer,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> God hath given us an underſtanding and judgement, that we are able to diſtinguiſh, praiſes to his name. We were in your ſtate and kingdom; but the Lord hath brought us out of it: therefore we are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to judge it and you, who hath no judgement but what is falſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prieſt.</hi> And you are querying, Whether leaving you to be guided by the conſcience, and to have no ſtanding rule whithout you, you ſay, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this be not to eſtabliſh Heathens and Philoſophy, and you conclude, that the Light is not pure before Faith.</p>
            <p>

But it is that you might appear that you are them that hate the light, and ſo hates Chriſt, and that you might be judged with all the children of light; and you that ſtumble at this light, you neither know God, nor Chriſt, nor Faith, nor Hope, and cannot preach the Goſpel, nor the Gifts, nor the Words; but onely death hears a fame, as <hi>Job</hi> ſaid, and deſtruction; for <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Prieſt.</hi> For you ſay, If every one that cometh into the world hath a light ſufficient to ſalvation, that makes the Scripture the Teſtimony of God unneceſſary, a revelation of his minde and love, which are nowhere to be found but there.</p>

               <hi>Reply.</hi> And here I charge you again, to ſet up the Scriptures before Chriſt, who is the love of God to loſt ſinners; who ſaith, It is nowhere found, but in the Scriptures. And here you ſhew you are in the ſtate of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which would have had life in the Scriptures, and would not come to Chriſt, but perſecuted him, as you do now them where the life is made manifeſt, this I ſay, This light wherewith Chriſt Jeſus hath enlightned, it will ſhew the greateſt ſin, yea, unbelief, and waiting in this light, which Chriſt hath enlightned, their ſalvation is made manifeſt; but all you that hate this light, you are enlightned with it, and it ſhall eternally condemn you: and you give it the term of a natural light and a moral, which there is no Scripture for, that ſpeaks of moral, as p. 5. but this light which you ſtumble at ſo much, and give it theſe terms, with it you ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned: you may as well ſay, Chriſt is moral, which there is no Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for: and there the plagues is added to you for adding your own inventions to that which was given forth from the eternal Spirit of God.</p>
            <p>And whereas you ſay, But we conceive not how Chriſt is preached out, but by them who brings the word of God, whoſe feet are beautiful.</p>
            <p>Here you have ſhewed forth you have no infallible judgement, not the Spirit that gave forth the Scripture, which judged them that did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive where you are, living in your conceivings and terms, the light to be as a moral law, as you call it; and ſo with the ſame eternal Spirit you are judged, for which there is no Scripture for moral; and ſo eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſheth Paganiſme, and heatheniſh Philoſophy, and abundance of ſuch ſtuffe you have in your book.

And we ſee you in the ſame generation that cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified him: you who are ſtumbling at the light, that enlightneth every one that cometh into the world; but it is becauſe your deeds are evil, who ſhall be condemned with it, which gave forth the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>You ſay in p. 6. It is by Scripture-light of the Prophets and Apoſtles, which once was read or heard, or elſe how could they know it?</p>
            <p>Here you ſhew, that you are in the ſtate of the Scribes and Phariſees, which read <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets which propheſied of him, and wrote of him, and they perſecuted him, the light which enlightneth every one that cometh into the world.

And you that ſtumble at the light that Chriſt, hath enlightned every one withal that cometh into the world, You ſtumble at the Spirit and Faith both, and hears not the Goſpel, but ſtumbles at the firſt Principle: and you have nothing to do to talk of Saints, Miniſters, nor of the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> but are of the firſt <hi>Adam.</hi> To that in your conſciences I ſpeak, be but honeſt, and that will let you ſee it; and here's a difference between you and the Saints; for the Saints to whom the Epiſtles was written, that walkt in the light, we make a difference between you that hate the light, and them that walk in it; for you that hate the light, take the Saints words, which was declared from the light, and make a profeſſion of their words; but with the light you ſhall be condemned from among the Saints: and to you this is the word of God, and Chriſt which was the Light, cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wo againſt ſuch Phariſees and hypocrites, as you are which ſtumbled at the light.</p>

            <p>But you ſay, If any one deſtroy your Faith, and make ſleight the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of your glorified Saviour.</p>
            <p>O you hypocrites, what have you to do to talk of a glorified Saviour, that ſtumble at the light? and what talk you of Faith who ſtumble at the light? your Faith is vain, and will fade away; but Faith in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt we own; and ſo it is you that trample upon the blood of the new covenant, as in p. 9.</p>
            <p>And whereas you ſay, You do confeſs God the Father of Lights natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and ſpiritual, and that the eternal word lightens every mans candle, whereby man ſees the eternal power and God-head of God, but nothing of the myſtery of the Father, and of Chriſt as a Mediator, is ſeen but onely by the children of God.</p>
            <p>What a confeſſion and doctrine is this by you? for you confeſs that man may ſee the eternal power and God-head of God and the Father, and know nothing of the myſtery of the Father and of Chriſt as a Mediator; and he that knows the Father knows the Son, and he that knows the Son knows the Fathers, and he hath the one hath the other alſo. And here I charge you in the preſence of the living God to be lyers, and know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and ſee not the Father nor the God head; can a man ſee the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal power and God-head of God, and know nothing of the myſtery of the Father, and of Chriſt as a Mediator? but here you ſhew you know nothing of the eternal power of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor the God-head of God, nor the myſtery of the Father, nor of Chriſt as a Mediator, who ſtumble at the light; but theſe things we ſee with the light, which Chriſt hath enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned us withal, an witneſs you to be without; for the Apoſtle which wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed the God-head, knew the myſtery of the Father which the heathens knew not.</p>
            <p>And in your p. 10. you ſay, That the Quakers ſay, that this light before mentioned is pure, which Chriſt hath enlightned w thal, and you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that this light in the conſcience is not pure, and ſaith, How doth vain man juſtifie that which God condemns? and would perſwade us that nature is not corrupt.</p>
            <p>Here again I charge you in the preſence of the living God to be lyers and blaſphemers: nature is corrupt; but the divine nature is not. And you that declare and ſay, That the light of Chriſt wherewith he hath enl ght<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned is a corrupt nature, Here I charge you in the preſence of the living Lord to be lyers, and the lye ſpake out of the falſe Prophets mouths, and conclude you all to be blaſphemers, who ſaith, the light of Chriſt where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he hath enlightned every one that cometh into the world is corrupt nature and not pure, and ſaith, God condemnes this light of Chriſt, which
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:118845:6"/>
is pure, and that's your own condemnation, the light, and ſaith, Vain man juſtifies that which God condemnes. Here I charge you again to be lyers, for the light of Chriſt doth condemn vain man, and it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the judgement of God, this light, and this light wherewith Chriſt hath enlightened every one that cometh into the world, ſhall be your eternal condemnation.</p>
            <p>And you are as high blaſphemers as ever your Fathers were, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes that the light which he hath enlightned withal is not pure, and call it corrupt nature; but this light, as I ſaid before, condemns corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and that which is not pure, and that you ſhall eternally witneſs; for to that which Chriſt hath enlightned you withal I ſpeak, which ſhall eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally condemn you, and witneſs me, when the book of conſcience is opened; you that hate it, whoſe deeds are evil, and ſtumble at it; but to all you that love it and walk in it ſhall not walk in darkneſs, but ſhall have that light of life, as I ſaid before.</p>
            <p>And you ſay, Moreover they ſay, the Quakers, That this light diſcovers every evil as it ariſeth in the heart.</p>
            <p>And your Anſwer is, That this light doth not diſcover the greateſt evil, which is unbelief.</p>
            <p>Here you ſhew your ſelves to be blinde guides indeed, which ſaith, That the light of Chriſt doth not diſcover to man the greateſt ſin, unbelief. And here we witneſs you to be lyers; for we witneſs, it ſhews man all his weakneſs and wants; and we witneſs waiting, in this light of Chriſt we ſee more light and ſtrength renewed from God, and the Goſpel enjoyed, and ſelf-denial in following Jeſus in the light which he hath given us, which teacheth to take up the croſs, and deny the world, in which world we ſee you to live in void of the knowledge of God, and ſtumbling at the light.</p>
            <p>And again, you are ſpeaking of a moral law.</p>

            <p>Part of this ſhall ſtand for your ſelves, you deluded ones; but the Spirit of truth you know not, that part is ours, and with it we ſee you to be without God in the world, ſtumbling at the light, whoſe hope ſhall periſh, which when the book of conſcience is opened, ſhall witneſs me eternally, and condemn you, and all people everywhere that hate it.</p>
            <p>You ſay, Some may dare toſay their hands are clean; but who can ſay their heart is clean? (I can) and ſee all your hearts unclean, who ſtumble at the light: the pure in heart ſees God, and ſee your hearts, which are deceitful above all things, you which knows it not.</p>

nor ſpeak to others whoſe hearts are not clean. Here you have made manifeſt you never ſaw God, for the pure in heart ſees God, and you ſee not your own hearts; and how can you pray? you cannot pray lifting up holy hands to the Lord, whoſe hearts are not clean. There I charge you in the preſence of the living God, your prayers to be hypocritical, and your hands to be full of blood.</p>
            <p>And again, whereas you are talking of ſhewing to man how impoſſible it is to enter into paradiſe.</p>
            <p>O ye blinde guides, what have ye to do talk of paradiſe, that knows not your own hearts, or ſhewing man the way? The Lord hath given me a pure heart and clean hands, by which all your deceits are diſcovered: and paradiſe we witneſs, which no ſuch corrupt hearts ſhall enter, who diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, whom the plagues of God is due to: and to you that hate the light, murtherers, <hi>Cains,</hi> who are ſo wrangling about the light, and ſays, <hi>The light in the conſcience diſcovers not ſecret things.</hi> Here you are out of the obedience of the light, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Chriſts words, who ſaith, That the light that he hath enlightned withal, ſhews man his evil deeds, and he will not bring his deeds to it, becauſe he knows they are evil, and therefore he ſtumbles, and this is his condemnation, and there you are to be condemned with the light of Chriſt, who are querying, who knows his heart, and there you are mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt to be in the firſt nature, and judgeth the light of Chriſt to be corrupt nature, like your ſelves, which you and your nature are to be condemned with the light of Chriſt, which is pure and eternal, which is the condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of you, and all the world that hate it.</p>

            <p>It appears by your ſtumbling at this light of Chriſt in man, that you are ignorant of the Scriptures, who ſaith, Ye are ſanctified by the obedience of the Spirit, <hi>And as many as receives him, to them he gives power to become the ſons of God.</hi> And the Son makes free, and he was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt to deſtroy the works of the devil, and his ſervants ye are to whom ye obey; and this light muſt be owned before he be owned.</p>

               <hi>Wherein ye cry out,</hi> Ye cannot hold your peace, for the deceit we ſeem to lay upon Christ and his Spirit, which is but the light of nature, not the light of Chriſt as a mediator.</p>
            <p>Ye blaſphemers, who calls the light of Chriſt, the light of nature, which Jeſus Chriſt is the light that enlightneth every man, and is the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, wherein ye are found to be them that draw back to perdition, and not to the ſaving the Soul, in drawing from the obedience of the light, which is the light of Chriſt in man, which ſhews him his natural condition; which the Apoſtle exhorteth to take heed unto, until the day dawned and the day-ſtar did ariſe, and ſuch experienced ones as you are, lives in jealouſies which are as ſtrong as death, who ſtumbles at the light of Chriſt, and calls it natural; O high blaſphemers!</p>

            <p>And as it is written, <hi>They that waited upon the Lord, their ſtrength was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed;</hi> and here let all the children of light which be in the light contrary to their own wills, and contrary to the will of man, you judge; and therefore it makes you ſtumble at it; and here in this you have deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the waiting upon God in the light, and watchings with the light, which hath declared, that all your watchings and waitings is without the light, an imitation which is to be condemned with the light: and many deriſions and reproaches have you given forth in your book; but theſe we wave, becauſe they do not touch us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And whereas you ſay,</hi> While you change the Name, and call the light Christ.</p>
            <p>Here you have declared you are not Miniſters of the letter: Chriſt ſaith, He is the light of the world, ſo ſay we, ſo it is you cannot own his name, but ſtumbles at the light, ſtumbles at the Mediator, ſo if the babes of Chriſt ſhould be ſilent, the ſtones in the walls would cry out againſt you.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>And whereas you ſay,</hi> By his diſobedience not obeying the light, he may fall from that eternal ſalvation which began to work in him by the power of light.</p>
            <p>And this is your implies, and ſo you interpret our words as you do the Scriptures, you that oppoſe the light you oppoſe your eternal ſalvation; and as touching eternal ſalvation, you that ſtumble at the light are for eternal deſtruction and condemnation with the light, which you ſtumble at; and who turnes from the light, turns from the ſalvation, and draws back into perdition.</p>

            <p>Eternal ſalvation from the wrath to come, and condemnation of hell, I witneſs, by the price of blood of Jeſus Chriſt, which is without you, and from the dominion of evil by Jeſus Chriſt, which your fathers crucified, &amp; you their children ſeek to crucifie him where he is made manifeſt, which ſtumbles at the light, and thou ands do begin to confeſs, That they are made free from the wrath to come, the dominion of evil by Jeſus Chriſt, who is the ſame yeſterday, to day and for ever, which witneſs the price of blood by which they are redeemed, which makes them clean from your generation, which hate the light.</p>

            <p>And whereas you ſay, That whoſoever bids man take heed to the light within, which the eternal Word hath enlightned, which enlightens him, which enlightneth every one that cometh into the world; in attendance thereto, puts man beſides the way of life, and ſaith, This aſſertion puts men quite beſides the way of ſalvation to attend upon that light which comes from the eternal word.</p>
            <p>If this put men aſide from the way of life, and put men quite beſide the way of ſalvation, to wait upon the light which comes from the eternal Word, Here again I take all the children of light to record how you are confuſed, and are beſide the way of life and ſalvation; for none knows the way of ſalvation, life, peace and righteouſneſs, but who owns this eternal light which is in the eternal Word: and ſo here all may ſee it is you that bring men quite beſides the way of life and eternal ſalvation, and terms the light of Chriſt to be the light of nature, and not pure.

            <p>Here you are confuſed, let the Reader take notice, was not the light of <hi>Moſes</hi> the light of the Goſpel, who wrote of Chriſt? ſhall they receive Light, Grace, Goſpel, and not ſtand before the throne of glory? you grant they may receive it; then here they may fall from the throne of glory, which you was accuſing them of you call Quakers before; they that fall from the light, fall from the eternal ſalvation. And ſo, O man, thus thy condemnation ariſeth of thy ſelf.</p>

            <p>Here you have manifeſted your ſelves to be in the generation of the Phariſees who hath the letter to talk of as they had; but the light where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Chriſt hath enlightned, ſhuts not the kingdom of heaven from men; but you that denies the light ſhuts the kingdom of God from men, and ſo denies the Goſpel; and them that hate this light, preaches not the Goſpel, but their own inventions, and takes away the authority of the Scriptures, who are in the ſame nature of your fathers that murthered the Prophets, Chriſt and the Apoſtles, and you the children of them: now where the life and power is made manifeſt among the Quakers, you act the ſame part of your fathers which all the righteous blood was ſhed by.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whereas you ſay,</hi> Your chief contention is, for the Goſpel administred by man.</p>
            <p>Here you contend for that the Apoſtle denied, not by man had he received it, neither was he made an Apoſtle by man. And here your Spirit is tried to be contrary to the Apoſtles and the Scripture.</p>

            <p>Bleſſed is he that believes and ſees not. <hi>And you ſay,</hi> You cannot tell how men ſhould believe, unleſs they ſaw the Apoſtles conditions.</p>
            <p>Here you ſhew your ſelves to be in the <hi>Jews</hi> doting condition, who are Miniſters of the letter, and your faith is theirs, and both is dead; he that believes is born of God, without Scripture, and yet witneſſed in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>

And ſo here again we do not take Scripture from you, but it is that you might be ſeen to be lyers, who ſeek to draw people from the light within, from the Goſpel and from the day-Star. So it is you that takes Scripture away from people, and layes it waſte, and makes it of no effect.</p>
            <p>And again you are inquiring, whether there be a prophetical light in every one.</p>
            <p>Here you have given Chriſt a new name contrary to Scripture, who ſaith he is the light, and enlightens every one; but here you ſhew out of what land you are come, who cals the light prophetical.</p>
            <p>And you are inquiring what this light in man propheſieth of.</p>
            <p>Here you ſhew your ſelves to be ſtrangers again from it, and hates it, the light wherewith Chriſt hath enlightned, who are inquiring, What is the day-ſtar? when you love the light you ſhall know what it propheſieth of, and what the day-ſtar is; but with this light you ſhall be condemned, and you are under that ſaying of Chriſt, <hi>Light ſhineth in darkneſs, and the darkneſs comprehendeth it not.</hi> And here you preach forth your ſelves to be blinde guides, who are ſtrangers from the day-ſtar.</p>

            <p>Theſe were the Apoſtles words to the Saints, which ſhew your ſelves to be them which have the words of the Apoſtles and Chriſt, as your fathers which had the writings of the Prophers, but was not wiſe unto ſalvation; but perſecuted Chriſt as you do, where he was made manifeſt.</p>

As for your ſtories and falſe applications, thoſe applications ſhall turn upon your ſelves; for they are not worth mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and you that deny this light, you neither read right nor underſtand the Scripture right.</p>

               <hi>And you ſay,</hi> It's more ſure, then a voice from the excellent glory concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the word of propheſie, which is to be tended upon, more then one riſen from the dead.</p>
            <p>This word of propheſie you know nothing of, which denies the light which Chriſt hath enlightned withal, your propheſie is the letter, which is death, and nothing of the excellency of the glory you know, who ſtumble at the light.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whereas you ſay,</hi> They ſay this light is the anointing from the Father, and that they need not teach one another.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, In this light waiting the anointing is known, which is received from the Father; but your darkneſs cannot comprehend this light. So you know not the anointing, which ſtumbles at the light, which keeps you out of the garden, of which you talk of breaking down the walls; it is but your walls that are broken down, that ſtumbles at the light, and with it you are condemned out of the garden, and all the Saints fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours.</p>
            <p>And for ſaying they need no man teach them but the Lord, this is wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed among thouſands; and they need not ſay, Know the Lord, who are come into the new covenant, this is witneſſed. And you ſay, <hi>This deſtroyes Paſtors, Elders, Biſhops, and plucks the ſeven ſtars out of the hand of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You enemies of God, is not Chriſt the covenant which was promiſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; who are in him need not ſay, Know the Lord, and is not he the end of the ſeven Stars, and Biſhops, and Paſtors, and Elders? and are not all theſe in their places, to bring up to the ſtature and fulneſs of Chriſt? and thoſe we witneſs in their places, but you are ſuch who ſtumbles at the light.</p>
            <p>Whereas you ſlander and ſay, <hi>It cuts off all instructions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All yours it doth who ſtumbles at the light, but who dwells in the light are moved of the Lord daily to inſtruct, and that which doth inſtruct, the ſame doth convince, and that is eternal; and the word of God is the fame now, which ſhall hew you down to the fire, and the dung, and ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer you down to the duſt, and all your twiſting twining inventions, which here is much of in this book, which is not worth mentioning, vented forth; but with the light you are comprehended, which you ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at.</p>
            <p>And again you ſay, The teaching of man is implyed, and not excluded.</p>
            <p>Here again you are contrary to the Scripture, and are excluded from the Apoſtles doctrine, which preach glad tidings, which was not made by the will of man.</p>

And whereas yon ſpeak of believing Chriſt in them, and that they periſh for want of believing Chriſt made manifeſt in their fleſh.</p>

And the Apoſtle ſpoke of a dying with Chriſt, and a riſing with Chriſt; and they were to take heed to the ſure word of propheſie, as to a light ſhining in a dark place: but this Chriſt is without you, and not made manifeſt in you as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, which Chriſt was in them except they were reprobates. Here your life is contrary to theirs, and with the life, which is the life of all the Saints, you are judged out of the life of the Scriptures, and to be reprobates: you ſpeak of Chriſt without you, and the Apoſtles ſpoke of Chriſt in you, except you be reprobates. And Chriſt in you the hope of glory, Chriſt the ſame yeſterday, to day, and ſor ever, we witneſs him made manifeſt amongſt us, and raigns as King, the ſame which ever was made manifeſt among the Saints; but you and your fathers, in your generation perſecuted him; for he is without you, as he was without your fathers, as you may read in <hi>Matthew,</hi> which be of the ſeed of your fathers the high Prieſts.</p>

            <p>Here you have ſhewed your ſelves to be as the Phariſees, which looked for the kingdom of God to come by obſervations. Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Behold the kingdom of God is within you,</hi> to the Phariſees, and they were of the world, and if thoſe words be ſpoken to your generations, they are not believed with you, as they were not with your fathers. And as touching <hi>John</hi>'s baptiſm and the Goſpel, ſilence fleſh; for you are far off that who ſtumbles at the light, and you are ſons of formality.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>You ſay,</hi> You hold a viſible order of the Church in the body, and is not of the ſubstance of the kingdom, that cannot be ſhaken, and yet in the Church.</p>
            <p>We that ye call Quakers do believe ye, and tread that ye call a viſible Regiment and Church under our feet as natural, for natural is viſible, and your Church is a Steeplehouſe, and for denying it, we ſuffer perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, as <hi>Stephen</hi> did, for denying the temple, who ſaw the ſubſtance, ſo do we, with that which cannot be ſhaken, which is the ſubſtance, and therefore deny your Steeplehouſe, which can be ſhaken, and your Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and your ſtanding forms, and your ſprinkling Infants: there is not a word in the Scripture that ſpeaks of a Sacrament and ſprinkling, Ye heathens that live altogether in formality.</p>
            <p>And as touching Paſtors, and Elders, and the Saints practice, you know nothing of, who ſtumble at the light, who are in your elementary things, Elders and Members Phariſee-like, who ſets themſelves againſt Chriſt, this is to comprehend you all under what form ſoever, which ſtumbles at the light, which ſhall condemn you all.

            <p>It's manifeſt they are not.

            <p>Here you do ſhew your ſelves to be them that would limit the Spirit of God, for God ſaith, <hi>He will pour out his Spirit upon all fleſh, and his ſons and daughters ſhall propheſie;</hi> &amp; the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>They may all propheſie one by one.</hi> And here you ſhew again you are contrary to the Apoſtles doctrine, and your underſtanding to be bruitiſh: and as touching the aſſemblies of the Saints, ſilence fleſh, or their prayers either; for either male or female, with the Spirit of the Lord they may teach or pray; but you that deny the Spirit, and cannot cloſe with his praying or teaching either, you have got a popiſh law of Queen <hi>Maries,</hi> that when ſome hath been moved to come into your Synagogues, ſome hath been beat, ſome ſtoned, ſome ſtocked

            </p>
            <p>O ye lyers, doth not the whole Scripture witneſs trembling? and the Saints gave forth the Scriptures, and ſuch had the Oracles of God, and we witneſs the ſame Spirit now: the Saints in light you cannot deceive; but the blinde you may lead into the ditch for a while.</p>

            <p>Whereas you are tormented at thoſe that forſake pride in apparel, and receiving honour of man, and giving honour to man, is it not according to Scripture, and the doctrine of Chriſt, who ſaith, <hi>How can ye believe which ſeeks honour one of another?</hi> And there you ſhew your ſelves to be out of the belief and the doctrine of Chriſt, which croſs the Saints doth paſs through to eternal life, which croſs is to the world, which croſs you live without who are puft up.</p>
            <p>And whereas you are ſpeaking for your ſchools and learning.</p>
            <p>There you ſhew where you are in the firſt nature, not in that as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles were in, who counted all loſs and dung, and denied all his bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up, and learning in the firſt birth, for the excellency of Chriſt, when he knew the excellency of him.</p>
            <p>Whereas you ſpeak of buying and ſelling.</p>

And your external religion not aboliſhed to the new creature, things that be external and worldly.</p>
            <p>Here you ſhew your ſelves to be enemies to the croſs of Chriſt, and your external Religion is carnal, which the new creature feeds not upon; and the pure Religion you are cleared from, which is to be kept unſpotted of the world, and this is eternal, and all old Ceremonies, and your exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Religion comes here to be trampled upon with the new creature, where all things are become new; but from this you are cleared and kept with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, who ſtumbles at the light.</p>
            <p>Something to that you call your confeſſion of apparel and faith, this is your doctrine, if you ſee a man boaſt in apparel, be not troubled; it may be all his portion in the world.</p>
            <p>Here you ſhew you are holders up of the world, and whom ye are friends to, and <hi>Lot</hi>'s righteous ſoul was grieved at their filthy converſation, and holders up of boaſters you are, which the Apoſtles doctrine denies both, and ſaid it was excluded, and gives way to that the Apoſtles declared againſt; and though you ſay the Scripture declares againſt pride and wantonneſs in apparel, yet you would not have it declared againſt, and ſaith, If thou ſee a man boaſt in apparel, be not troubled. And here you ſhew again what Spirit you are on, the world loves its own, contrary to the righteous ſoul.</p>

               <hi>Whereas you ſay,</hi> Apparel grew in uſe for distinction of ſexes and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of perſons, modeſty, and cuſtome of the country, and members of ſocieties, and greater matters.</p>
            <p>Was it the apparel that grew in uſe for diſtinction of all theſe? there you are who knows one another outwardly with your apparel, who are in the cuſtoms of the country, without, in the faſhions of the world, without the doctrine of Chriſt, and not in the kingdom of Chriſt, and we know all creatures were created to be uſed in their places as ſervants to us, and whatſoever we do and uſe, it muſt be to the glory of God. So all your pride amongſt you rich and proud ones muſt down; the ſword of the Lord is drawn out of the ſheath, and fitted for the ſlaughter; take warning all you proud and lofty ones that are numbred for the ſword, and all your bags of honour, as you call it, muſt be trampled upon; for that which is in eſteem with you in your generation, is abominrble to the Lord; but all men in the Lord we honour.</p>
            <p>In the luſts of ignorance you are, and you would make people believe, it was their apparel which kept off the bruitiſh ſort of men.</p>
            <p>In the luſts and in your ignorance you are, in the wanton world igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the true God, who confeſſed you was not ſent before as the Apoſtles were, and ſo you have not learned Chriſt, and know not his coming, and all this dirty ſtuff is not worth mentioning.</p>

            <p>Here you manifeſt your ſelves, who make no diſtinction among men, for all men in the Lord we honour, but all men out of the Lord are not to be honoured, for ungodly, ſuch as you are, are for condemnation,

            <p>One of your Mothers which two ſervants of the Lord were moved to go to, <hi>Cambridge,</hi> were whipped and ſcourged till their bodies were torn, and many in your Synagogues in the North, ſome ſtocked, ſtoned, beat, and many impriſoned, as in <hi>Carlile, Kendal, York, Chester, Lancaſter, Newcaſtle,</hi> which theſe Goales now doth witneſs it, the fruits of your Miniſteries, and now it ſelf doth ſhew it's <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Core,</hi> and not ſent immediately, as you confeſs it, as the Apoſtles were, and God is bringing down your pride, your honour, renown and glory; the ſword of the Lord is drawn againſt you, take warning, and againſt all your gluttony and drunkenneſs which you are ſpeaking of in your book, which is not worth mentioning, which ſhews where your mindes are; but I ſhall let it ſtand for your ſelves.

            <p>Something you do write and oppoſe the law of community, as you call it.</p>
            <p>Here you are againſt the Spirit of life, for they that did believe were of one heart, &amp; they that do believe are born of God, and amongſt ſuch there was was no oppreſſour, no taskmaſter, &amp; it's ſaid all things were common, no man ſaid, This is my own; but with the Spirit of the living God which ſanctifies, all ſuch bruitiſh, ſenſual, luſtful, deviliſh and worldly covetous taskmaſters, oppreſſors, and whoremongers, thieves, lyers &amp; curſed ſpeakers as you are, who live in all unrighteouſneſs, and in pride, &amp; loftineſs hath no part in this communion, for no unrighteouſneſs ſhall inherit the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, but your law and community is without, and we deny it, and you to have any part in this communion, but in the lake that burnes, who ſtumbles at the light, in which there is unity, and ſaith it is not pure, and that you are not ſent as the Apoſtles were immediately, who act ſin and unrighteouſneſs, and ſtumbles at the light, ſo all the ungodly you think are let looſe, but here is no bait for them, but are kept out you and them both, with that in which is your communion, but all the conditions of the Saints paſſages, travels and progreſſes we own in their places, and who acted under figures and ſhadows we own, but you who are not come to Chriſts doctrine, who is not come to give your coat yet who hath two, you we deny.</p>
            <p>And as you ſay giving a coat of two to him that hath none.</p>
            <p>This torments you, you ſtumble at this as at the light, you enemies of God and murtherers, with the luſts you ſhew where your hearts is, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pitty or compaſſion, who wilt not cover thy own fleſh; but it is that you may be made manifeſt: and you have ſhewed that you are out of the doctrine of Chriſt: you have been pleading for your intereſt in the

               <hi>Whereas you are ſlandering and ſaying,</hi> We are breaking marriage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>bonds and wedlock, becauſe we queſtion what Scripture the Prieſts have to marry peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and take money for it.</p>
            <p>O ye enemies of God, where do you read in all the Scriptures, that the Prieſts are to take money for marrying of people? ſuch trades we deny, if you call that wedlock. Marriage is honourable in all things where the the bed is undefiled, and that we own; but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge, and ſuch we deny, and all the Prieſts practiſes which they have no Scripture for, and therefore we queſtion them with authority, and deny them both.</p>
            <p>Whereas you are ſpeaking of ſome that are not free to be Tenants.</p>
            <p>Is the Lord drawing his people from under you taskmaſters, as from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> which are proud and oppreſſors, which you Prieſts have been examples of, and taught the people? And this torments you now you Prieſts, becauſe you are againſt it, who have been the oppreſſors of the creation, and are, but the Lord is gathering his people from under you now, as he did from under <hi>Pharaoh:</hi> and doth proud <hi>Pharaoh</hi> begin to rage? if this torment you, you ſhall ſee more come with everlaſting ſongs upon their heads, ſinging over <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his hoſt.

Therefore wo to you bloody <hi>Cains,</hi> which are compaſt under the wo, you are of the ſtock of them that build <hi>Babel,</hi> who are <hi>Babylon,</hi> harlotted from the living God, and your Mother hath ſit as a Queen deckt with her colours; but now the time of her widow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood is come, and loſs of children, and ſhe hath loſt many children, and that, many Kings and Merchants of the earth laments, crying, Alas, alas.</p>

            <p>And your boaſting, as giving up your bodies and eſtates. But let theſe words return upon your ſelves again, and ſee where your bodies are, where your lives and eſtates are; for many lies in priſon, becauſe they will not pay Prieſts Tythes, which is contrary to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt and his doctrine, which the Apoſtles ever lived in, for he never ſent you; for you confeſs you are not ſent immediately as the Apoſtles were.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>You ſay,</hi> There is not a propheſie in all the Scriptures, that takes away all outward teachers.</p>

Here I am full of the Spirit and power of the Lord to declare againſt you, for in <hi>John,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>Ye need not any man téach you.</hi> There is mans teaching outwardly denied, and in <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. he ſaith, <hi>Ye ſhall not teach eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man his neighbour, ſaying, Know the Lord, for all ſhall know him.</hi> All who are in the new Covenant, witneſſeth this; and who witneſs the new Covenant, witneſs the Son of man: and <hi>Jeremiah</hi> propheſied, <hi>That they ſhall no more teach every man his neighbour, ſaying, Know the Lord.</hi> And here you enemies of the God, are raced out of the Covenant, and are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the Lord.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſaith, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, I will deliver my ſheep from their mouthes that hath devoured them,</hi> ſuch as you that have ſought for the fleece and for the wool, <hi>and I will ſearch out my ſheep, and finde them out, and feed them upon the top of the mountaines, ſaith the Lord of hoſts;</hi> he that hath an ear to hear, let him; for he feeds upon the top of the mountains of Iſrael. And <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith, <hi>All the children of the Lord ſhall be taught of the Lord, and much peace ſhall they have, and in righteouſneſs ſhall they be eſtabliſhed.</hi> And here let this propheſie judge you to be out of the new Covenant, and contrary to the Prophets and Apoſtles, which ſay, <hi>You are not ſent immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately as the Apoſtles were;</hi> ſo how can you witneſs their conditions? ſo here you have brought your ſelves under the chain. And <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Lord ſpeaks in him, Behold the dayes come, ſaith the Lord, that I will make a new covenant, not according to the covenant I made with their fathers; but this is the covenant that I will make with the houſe of Iſrael, After thoſe daies, ſaith the Lord, I will put my laws in their inward parts, and in their hearts will I write them, and I will be their God, and they ſhall be my people.</hi> And all theſe Scriptures I charge you all, ye Prieſts of <hi>England,</hi> to have laid waſte, and have brought none into the new Covenant, neither are you there your ſelves, who ſtumble at the light, and denies the firſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.

And for quoting many Scriptures of the Epiſtles, and bringing the conditions of the Saints written in the Epiſtles, and not knowing what condition they were written to, let the readers of the book examine the Scriptures which you bring in your book, and then they will ſee how you wreſt the Scriptures to oppoſe the truth, and how ignorant you are of the Scriptures.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>You ſay,</hi> Why may not Satan help on mortification, for ſuch an end as to take away the death of Chriſt without you?</p>
            <p>For Chriſt is without you, we witneſs; but your mortification that the devil helps on, we deny; and the plain Scriptures without any private interpretation we own; and all your ſences, meanings, interpretations and diſputes we deny; and you to be in <hi>Babylon</hi> in the ſtate of the Phariſees, Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerers, and among dogs &amp; ſwine, ſome in the luſt, and ſome in the mire, are not ſome drunk, and ſome as proud as they can go? let you converſation witneſs it, and all your arguments, and conſequences we do deny, for you ſay, <hi>You are not ſent immediately as the Apostles were;</hi> therefore ye are to be declared againſt, that leads people with the mediate into the earth, the luſt and mire, envious, proud and covetous, like your ſelves, and the plagues of God is to come upon you all, who live not in the doctrine of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Prieſt. <hi>And whereas you ſlander and ſay,</hi> That many writings of the the Papists are applauded and uſed by them of this way.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> Your writings and theirs we abhor, which are contrary to the doctrine of Chriſt. And whereas you were ſpeaking of Jeſuits books, we put you all together Jeſuits and Prieſts, for you Prieſts have had their Law to maintain your Miniſtery, and guard your Pulpit; for with one Law of men, have, and are you Prieſts of <hi>England</hi> and Jeſuits upheld, ſo we that cry againſt Popery, doth and muſt againſt you all, and with the Spirit of the living God; for it was before her Law was; for where ſome have ſpoken in their time, have been impriſoned, and many lyes in priſon now; ſo he that ſits in heaven laugheth at you, the Lord hath you in deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: and them that dwell in the light, &amp; are on the watch, have ſeen what your books have brought forth, (your folly) and that the truth is exalted above all your lyes and ſlanders. And they are at the battering of error, who are in the commandment of the everlaſting God, who witneſs the

everlaſting Goſpel, the revelation of Jeſus, and the life of the Prophets, and are in the obedience of the Faith, who doth warn all to take heed of all ſeducing Spirits, which draws from the light within, which enlightens every one which comes into the world, there is every one of your teachers in particular, there is every one of your condemnation that hates it, whoſe deeds are evil.</p>
            <p>Prieſt. <hi>Whereas you ſlander and ſay,</hi> That ſome of them you call Quakers do expoſe themſelves to be perſecuted, to ſufferings.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> O ye perſecuters and ſlanderers, would you juſtifie your ſelves in deſtroying the innocent? and make this your cloak, and ſay, <hi>They ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe themſelves to it,</hi> when many are almoſt murthered in your ſteeple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes? but God is the ſtrength of his people.</p>
            <p>Priest. <hi>And whereas you ſay,</hi> That they put no difference between the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts and the Protestants.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> Are they not both in a nature, which are not in the power of God? and who hath one law of Queen <hi>Maries</hi> for your protection; for you have had that Popiſh Law of Queen <hi>Maries</hi> to defend you; and doth not the Scripture ſay, <hi>Every one that cometh into the world is enlightned with Christ?</hi> which light is your condemnation that hate it, which light ſearches the ſecrets of every mans heart.</p>
            <p>Prieſt. <hi>You ſay,</hi> God who commanded light to ſhine out of darkneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> This is not your condition, it hath not ſhined forth of you which ſtumble at the light, which hath enlightned every one that comes into the world.</p>
            <p>Prieſt. <hi>While you have been in your ſinful ſilence, you ſay,</hi> Some privily have brought in damnable hereſies denying the Lord that bought them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Relpy.</hi> This ſhall ſtand for your ſelves, who ſaith, <hi>You are found all your life time groaning under the burthen of ſin.</hi> Here I take all people in the light to record, by whom I ſee you deny the Lord Jeſus, who came to ſave his people from their ſins, and to deſtroy the works of the devil, which you ſay, <hi>They muſt all their life time groan under,</hi> and the Apoſtles ſaid, <hi>They were made free from ſin;</hi> and here your doctrine is contrary to theirs, as in <hi>p.</hi> 15. and I take all people to record, and let them read, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. if you be not thoſe <hi>Peter</hi> ſpoke of, <hi>Which denies the Lord Jeſus that bought them, and hath brought upon your ſelves ſwift destruction,</hi> &amp; many doth follow your pernicious wayes, by whom the way of truth is evil ſpoken of, and through covetouſneſs and fained words, you have made merchandize of the people, who have gone in the way of <hi>Cain,</hi> after the error of <hi>Balaam,</hi> as you now have made it appear to the children of light, who beguiles un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable ſoules, eyes full of adultery, ſporting your ſelves in the day time, evil beaſts made to be deſtroyed, ſpeaking great ſwelling words of vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty through the luſts of the fleſh, promiſing your ſelves liberty, but the mean while, your ſelves are the ſervants of corruption, and they that are eſcaped from you through the knowledge of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, &amp; comes to be entangled again among you, their latter end is worſe then the firſt, and they had better never have known the way of truth; but it

is happened to ſuch, as the old proverb is, <hi>The dog to vomit, and the ſow to the wallowing in the mire.</hi> Therefore a warning to all you brethren, that are in the light and in the knowledge of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that you may be kept unſpotted from the world, and to reign over all ſuch who are in the luſts of the fleſh, and out of the doctrine of Chriſt, that ſerves not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt but your own bellies.</p>
