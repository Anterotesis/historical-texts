            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Right of the Succession Defended.</head>
            <p>THe fourth Conclusion to be cleared
was, that neither the People, not
Parliaments of this Kingdom, could seclude
the lineall Successor, or could raise to the
throne any other of the same Royal line.</p>
            <p>For clearing whereof, I shall according to
my former method, first clear what is our po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
Law in this case; Secondly I shall shew
that this our Law is founded upon excellent
reason, and lastly, I shall answer the objections.</p>
            <p>As to the first. It is by the second Act
of our last Parliament acknowledged, <q>That
the Kings of this realme deriving their
Royal power from God Almighty alone,
do lineally succeed therto, according to
the known degrees of proximitie in blood,
which cannot be interrupted, suspended
or diverted by any Act or Statut what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever,
and that none can attempt to alter
or divert the said Succession, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volving
the subjects of this Kingdom in
Perjury and Rebellion, and without expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
them to all the fatal and dreadful
consequences of a civil warr, Do THERE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FORE
from a hearty and sincere sense of
their duty Recognize, acknowledge and
declare that the right to the Imperial
Crown of this realme, is by the inherent


<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59994:4"/>
right and the nature of Monarchy, as well as
by the fundamental and unalterable laws of
this realme, transmitted and devolved by a
lineal Succession, according to the proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of blood. And that upon the death
of the King or Queen, who actually reignes,
the Subjects of this Kingdom are bound by
Law, duty and alledgance to obey the
nixt immediat and Lawful Heir either male
or female, upon whom the right and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration
of the Government is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly
devolved. And that no difference in
Religion, nor no Law nor Act of Parliament
made, or to be made, can alter or divert the
right of Succession and lineal descent of the
Crown to the nearest and Lawful Heirs,
according to the degrees foresaids: nor can
stop or hinder them in the full, free and
actuall administration of the Government
according to the Laws of the Kingdom.
LIKE AS OUR SOVERAIGNE LORD, with
advice and consent of the saids Estates of
Parliament, Do declare it is high treason
in any of the Subjects of this Kingdom,
by writing, speaking, or any other manner of
way to endeavour the alteration, suspension
or diversion of the said right of Succession,
or the debarring the next Lawfull Successor
from the immediat, actual, full and free


<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59994:4"/>
administration of the Government, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
to the Laws of the Kingdom. And
that all such attempts or designes shall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
against them the paine of treason.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This being not only ane Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
declaring all such as shall endeavour
to alter the Succession, to be punishable, as
Traitors; but containing in it a Decision of
this Point by the Parliament, as the Supream
Judges of the nation, and ane acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by them, as the representatives of the
people, and nation. There can be no place for
questioning a point, which they have plac'd
beyond all contraversie: especially seing it
past so unanimously that there was not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
no vote given but even no argument pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon'd
against it. And the only doubt mov'd
about it was, whither any Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or acknowledgement, was necessary, in
a point which was in it self so uncontraver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
And which all who were not desperat fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticks,
did conclude to be so in this nation,
even after they had hear'd all the arguments
that were us'd, and the Pamphlets that were
written against it, in our neighbour-Kingdom.</p>
            <p>But because so much noise has been made
about this question, and that blind bigotry
leads some, and humorous faction drawes
others out of the common road. I conceive it


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59994:5"/>
will be fit to remember my reader of these
following reasons, which will I hope clear that
as this is our present positive Law, so it is esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
upon the fundamental constitution of
our Government, upon our old Laws, upon
the Laws of God, of Nature, of Nations,
and particularly of the Civil Law.</p>
            <p>As to the fundamental constitution of our
Government, I did formerly remark, that
our Historians tell us, that the <hi>Scots</hi> did swear
alledgeance to FERGUS, who was the first
of our Kings, and to his Heirs. And that they
should never obey any other, but his Royal
Race. Which Oath does in Law, and reason,
bind them to obey the lineal Successor,
according to the proximity of Blood. For ane
indefinite obligation to obey the blood Royal,
must be interpreted according to the proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
in Blood, except the swearers had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
to themselves a power to choose any of
the Royal Familie, whom they pleas'd,
which is so true, that in Law, ane obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
granted to any man, does in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of Law accresce to his Heirs,
though they be not exprest. <hi>Qui sibi provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>det,
&amp; haeredibus providet.</hi> And <hi>Boethius</hi> tells
us that after King FERGUS'S death, the <hi>Scots</hi>
finding their new Kingdom infested with
warrs, under the powerful influence of <hi>Picts,


<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59994:5"/>
Romans,</hi> and <hi>Britans,</hi> they refus'd notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
to preferre the next of the Royal
Race, who was of perfect age, and a man of
great merit, to the Son of King FERGUS,
though ane infant; which certainly in reason
they would have done, if they had not been
ty'd to the lineal Successor. But lest the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
should be prejudg'd during the minori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
they enacted, that for the future, the next
of the Blood Royal should alwayes in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority
of our Kings administrat as Kings, till
the true Heir were of perfect age. But this
does not prove, as <hi>Buchannan</hi> pretends, that
the people had power to advance to the
Throne, any of the Royal Race: whom they
judg'd most fit, for common sense may tell
us, that was not to choose a King, but a Vice-Roy,
or a Regent. For, though to give him the
more authority, and so to enable him the
more to curb factions, and oppose enimies,
he was called King, yet he was but <hi>Rex fidei
Commissarius,</hi> being oblidg'd to restore it to
the true Heir at his majority: and so Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
only in his Vice, and consequently was
only his Vice-roy.</p>
            <p>But because the Uncles, and next Heirs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
once admitted to this <hi>fidei Commissarie</hi>
tittle, were unwilling to restore the Crown to
their Nephews, and sometimes murder'd


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59994:6"/>
them: and oftetimes rais'd factions against
them. Therefore the People abhorring these
impieties, and weary of the distractions, and
divisions, which they occasion'd, beg'd from
King KENNETH the second, that these fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Laws might be made.</p>
            <p>1. That upon the Kings death the next
Heir of whatsoever age should succeed.</p>
            <p>2. The Grand-childe either by Son or
Daughter should be preferr'd.</p>
            <p>3. That till the King arriv'd at 14 years of
age, some Wise-man should be choos'd to
Govern, after which, the King should enter
to the free administration, and according to
this constitution, some fit Person has still been
choos'd Regent in the Kings minority, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
respect to the proximity of Blood, and
our Kings have been oftentimes Crown'd in
the Cradle.</p>
            <p>In conformity also to these principles, all
the acknowledgements made to our Kings,
run still in favours of the King, and his Heirs.
As in the first Act Parl. 18. JAMES VI. and
the II, III, IV. Acts Parl. 1. CHARLES II.
And by our Oath of Alledgeance, we are
bound to bear faithful and true alledgeance
to his <hi>Majesty,</hi> his Heirs and Lawful Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors;
which word LAWFUL, is insert,
to cutt off the pretexts of such as should not


<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59994:6"/>
succeed by Law, and the insolent arbitrarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of such, as being but subjects themselves,
think they may choose their King. <hi>viz.</hi> Act 1.
Parl. 21. JAMES 6.</p>
            <p>That this right of Succession according
to the proximity of blood, is founded
on the Law of God, is clear by <hi>Num.</hi>
Chap. 27. v. 9. and 10. <hi rend="margQuotes">If a man hath no
Son or Daughter, his inheritance shall
descend upon his Brother, </hi>; by <hi>Num.</hi> 36.
Where, God himself decides in favours of
the Daughters of <hi>Zelophehad,</hi> telling us,
it was a just thing, they should have the
inheritance of their father. And ordaines,
that if there were no Daughters, the estate
should go to the Brothers. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
concluds <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. If Sons, then Heirs,
looking upon that, as a necessary conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence;
which if it do not necessarly hold,
or can be any way disappointed, all his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
reasoning in that Chapter falls to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
And thus <hi>Ahaziah 2 Chron. 22.
v.</hi> 1. was made King (though the youngest)
in his Fathers stead; because sayes the text,
<hi rend="margQuotes">the <hi>Arabians</hi> had slain all the eldest:</hi> which
clearly shews that by the Law of God, he
could not have succeeded, if the eldest had
been alive. We hear likewayes in Scripture,
God oft telling, <hi rend="margQuotes">By me Kings reigne.</hi>


               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:59994:7"/>
And when he gives a Kingdom to any as
to <hi>Abraham, David,</hi> &amp;c. He gives it to
them and their posterity.</p>
            <p>That this right of Succession flowes from
the Law of nature, is clear; because, that
is accounted to flow from the Law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which every man finds grafted in his
own heart, and which is obey'd without
any other Law, and for which men neither
seek nor can give another distinct reason; all
which hold in this case: for who doubts
when he heares of ane hereditary Monarchy,
but that, the next in blood must Succeed;
and for which we need no positive Law,
nor does any man enquire for a further rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
being satisfied therein by the principles
of his own heart. And from this ground it
is, that though a remoter Kinsman did possess
as Heir, he could by no length of time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
a valide right; since no man, as Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers
conclude, can prescribe a right against
the Law of nature: and that this principle
is founded thereupon is confest <hi rend="margQuotes">l: cùm ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio

in Brothers. As for instance, though his

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59994:8"/>
CHARLES the II., yet he is Son to King
CHARLES I. and therefore, as Saint
<hi>Paul</hi> sayes, if a Son, then ane Heir, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
he be secluded by the existence and
Succession of ane elder Brother.</p>
            <p>That this gradual Succession is founded
on the Law of nations, is as clear by the
Laws of the 12 Tables, and the Praetorian
Law of <hi>Rome.</hi> And if we consider the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy
either old or new, we will find, that
wherever the Monarchy was not elective, the
degrees of succession were there exactly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served.
And <hi>Bodinus</hi> de Republ. lib. 6 Cap. 5.
asserts, that, <hi rend="margQuotes">Ordo non tantum naturae &amp;

hoc postulat.</hi> From all which, Pope <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent</hi>

concludes, <hi rend="margQuotes">In regnis haereditariis ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veri

And since it is expresly determined, that the
right of blood can be taken away by no posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Law or Statute <hi>L. Jura Sanguinis ff. de
Reg. jur. &amp; L. 4. ff. de suis legitim.</hi> and that
the power of making a Testament, can be
taken away by no Law <hi>L. ita legatum ff. de
conditionibus.</hi> I cannot see how the right of
Succession can be taken away by a Statute:
for that is the same with the right of Blood,


<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59994:8"/>
and is more strongly founded upon the Law
of nature, than the power of making Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>Since then this right is founded upon the
Law of God, of nature and of nations, it
does clearly follow, that no Parliament can
alter the same by their municipal Statutes,
as our Act of Parliament has justly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served.</p>
            <p>For clearing whereof, it is fit to consider,
that in all powers and jurisdictions which are
subordinat to one another, the Inferiour
should obey, but not alter the power to
which it is subordinat; and what it does
contrary thereto, is null and void. And
thus, if the judges of <hi>England</hi> should publish
edicts contrare to Acts of Parliament, or if
a Justice of Peace should ranverse a decree of
the judges of <hi>West-minster,</hi> these their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
would be void and ineffectual.
But so it is, that by the same principle, but
in ane infinitly more transcendent way, all
Kings and Parliaments are subordinat to the
Laws of God, the Laws of Nature, and the
Laws of Nations: And therefore no Act of
Parliament can be binding, to overturn what
these have established.</p>
            <p>This, as to the Law of God, is clear,
not only from the general dictats of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59994:9"/>
but 28 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. cap. 7. the Parliament
uses these words, <hi rend="margQuotes">For no man can dispence
with Gods Laws; which we also affirme and
think.</hi> And as to the Laws of nature, they
must be acknowledged to be immutable, from
the principles of reason. And the Law it
self confesses that <hi rend="margQuotes">naturalia quaedam jura
quae apud omnes gentes peraequè observan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,
divina quadam providentia constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta
semper firma, atque immutabilia per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent
§. sed naturalia Institut. de Jur,
Natural. &amp; §. singulorum de rer. divis:</hi>
And when the Law declares, that a Supream
Prince is free from the obligation of Laws,
<hi>Solutus legibus,</hi> which is the highest power
that a Parliament can pretend to, or arrive
at; Yet Lawyers still acknowledge that
this does not exeem these Supream powers
from being lyable to the Laws of God, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and nations, <hi>Accurs: in l. Princeps ff.

Bart. <hi>in l. ut vim de justitiâ &amp; jure</hi>
Voet. <hi>de Statutis</hi> Sect. 5. Cap. 1. nor can
the Law of nations be overturned by private
Statutes, or any Supream power. And thus
all Statuts to the prejudice of Ambassadours,
who are secured by the Law of nations,
are confess'd by all to be null, and the highest
power whatsoever cannot take off the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity


<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59994:9"/>
of denuncing warr before a warr can
be Lawful. And Lawyers observe verie
well, that these who would oppose the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
dictats of mankind, should be look't
upon as enemies to all mankind.</p>
            <p>My second argument shall be, that the
King &amp; Parliament can have no more power
in Parliament than any absolute Monarch
has in his own Kingdom: for, they are
when joyn'd, but in place of the Supream
power, sitting in judgement; and therefore
they cannot in Law do what any other Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
and absolute Monarch cannot do. For
all the power of Parliaments consists only in
their consent, but we must not think, that
our Parliaments have ane unlimited power
<hi>de jure,</hi> so, as that they may forfeit or kill
without a cause or decerne against the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
without citing or hearing them; or,
that they can alienat any part of de King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
or Subject the wholl Kingdom to France
or any other Forraigne Prince: all which
deeds would be null in themselves, and
would not hinder the partie injur'd from a
due redress. For if our Parliaments had such
power, we would be the greatest slaves, and
live under the most arbitrary Government
imaginable. But so it is, that no Monarch
whosoever can take from any man what is


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59994:10"/>
due to him, by the Law of God, nature,
and nations. For being himself inferiour to
these he cannot overturne their statuts. Thus
a Prince cannot even <hi>ex plenitudine potesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis
legitimat</hi> a Bastard <hi>in prejudice</hi> of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
children though they have only but a
hope of Succession <hi>l. 4. &amp; sequen de natal.
restituend.</hi> and for the same reason, it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
in the same Law, that he cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
a free'd man <hi>(restituere libertum na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talibus)</hi>
in prejudice of his Patron, who was
to succeed, though that succession was but
by a municipal Law. For clearing which
question, It is fit to know that the solid
lawyers who treat <hi>jus publicum,</hi> as AR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NISAEUS
and others, do distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
such Kingdoms, as were at first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
by the People, and wherein the Kings
succeed by contract, and in these, the Laws
made by King and People can exclude, or
bind the Successor. And yet even here, they
confess, that this proceeds not, because the
Predecessor can bind the Successor, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the People renew the paction with the
succeeding King. But where the Successor is
to succeed <hi>ex jure regni,</hi> in hereditary Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies,
there they assert positively that the
Predecessor cannot prejudge the Successors
right of Succession. Which they prove by two


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59994:10"/>
arguments. First, that the Predecessor has
no more power, nor right, than the Successor:
for the same right, that the present King has to
the possession, the next in Blood has to the
Succession. And all our Laws run in favours
of the King, and his Heirs, and no man can
tye his equal, or give him the Law, <hi>par in
parem non habet dominium.</hi> The second is,
that it were unjust and unequitable that the
Predecessor should robbe his Successor <hi rend="margQuotes">nulla
ergo</hi> (sayes <hi>Arnisaeus Cap. 7. Num. 5.) clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sula
Successori jus auferri potest, modò suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedat

is a very absolute Monarchy, <hi rend="margQuotes">Eaquae jure

when the King of <hi>France</hi> design'd to break the
Salique Law of Succession, as in the Reigne
of CHARLES the V. It was found impracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
by the three Estates, and when <hi>Pyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhus</hi>

grand <hi>Seignior,</hi> having left the <hi>Turkish</hi>
Empire to <hi>Han</hi> the <hi>Tartarian,</hi> passing by
his Brother <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> the wholl Officers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
of that State, did unanimously Cancel that


<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59994:11"/>
Testament, and restore <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> the true
Heir tho a silly foole.</p>
            <p>Which shewes the opinion not only of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyers
but of whole nations and Parliaments;
<q>Tho <hi>vander Graaff,</hi> an <hi>Hollander</hi> confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
that it is not Lawfull to choose any of
his Sons to succeed him, in which, the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
quiet of the Kingdom is much concerned.
And therefore, tho the next Heir were wiser,
braver, and more generally beloved; Yet the
more immediat must be received, as choos'd
by God, whither good or bad, and as hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with his Character.</q> And if Kings could
have inverted their Succession, and choos'd
their own Successor Saint <hi>Lewis</hi> had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
his own third Son to <hi>Lewis</hi> his eldest,
and <hi>Alfonsus</hi> King of <hi>Leon</hi> in <hi>Spaine,</hi> had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
his Daughters to <hi>Ferdinand</hi> his eldest
Son. And <hi>Edward</hi> the VI. of <hi>England</hi> had
preferr'd, and did actually preferre the Lady
<hi>Iean Gray</hi> to his Sisters <hi>Mary,</hi> and <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth.</hi>
And if Successions especially of such
great importance, had not been fixed by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable
Laws of God, and nature, the various
and unconstant inclinations of the present
Governours, especially when shaken by the
importunity of Step-mothers and Mothers,
or clouded by the jealousie of flatterers, or
favourits, had made the Nations whom they


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59994:11"/>
Governed, very unhappy: and therefore, God
did very justly, and wisely setle this Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
that both King and People might know,
that it is by him that Kings Reigne, and
Kingdoms are secur'd in Peace against faction.
and it were strange, that this should not
hold in Kings, since even amongst subjects
the Honour and Nobility that is bestow'd
upon a Man and his Heirs, does so necessar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
descend upon those Heirs, that the Father,
or Predicessor cannot seclude the next Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor,
or derogat from his right, either by
renuncing, resigning, following base or
meane Trades, or any other: <q>For say
those Lawyers, since he derives this right
from his old Progenitors, and owes it not
to his Father, his Fathers deed should not
prejudge him therein.</q> 
               <hi>Fab. Cod. 9. Tit. 28.
Def. 1. Warnee; Consil. 20. Num.</hi> 7. And as
yet the Estates of Parliament in both Nations
have no legislative power, otherwayes than
by assenting to what the King does; so that
if the King cannot himself make a Successor,
neither can they by consenting: and all that
their consent could imply wold only be that,
they and their Successors should not oppose
his nomination, because of their consent.
But that can never amount to a power of
transferring the Monarchy from one branch


<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59994:12"/>
to another, which would require, that the
Transferrers; or bestowers had the Supream
power Originally in themselves, <hi>nemo enim
plus juris in alium transferre potest quàm
ipse in se habet.</hi> And if the States of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
had this power Originally in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to bestow, why might they not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
it to themselves? And so perpetuate
the Government in their own hands:
And this mov'd judge <hi>Jenkins</hi> in his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
concerning the liberty and freedom of the
subject, <hi>pag.</hi> 25. To say, that <hi>no King can be
Named, or in any time made in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
by the People. A Parliament never
made a King, for there were Kings before
there were Parliaments, and Parliaments
are summoned by the Kings writtes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, A King cannot in Law alienat his
Crown, as is undenyable in the opinion of all
Lawyers, and if he do, that deed is voyd and
null, nor could he in Law consent to an Act
of Parliament declaring that he should be
the last King. And if such consents and Acts
had been sufficient to bind Successors, many
silly Kings in several parts of <hi>Europe</hi> had
long since been prevail'd upon, to alter their
Monarchy from <hi>Haereditarie</hi> to <hi>Elective;</hi> or
to turn it in a Common-wealth; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
by the same reason, they cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent


<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59994:12"/>
to exclude the true Successor: For if
they may exclude one they may exclude all.</p>
            <p>5. In all Societies and Governments, but
especially where there is any association of
powers, as in our Parliaments, there are
certain fundamentals, which like the Noble
parts in the Body are absolutly necessar for
its preservation; for without these, there
would be no Ballance, or certainty. And
thus with us, if the King and each of the
Estates of Parliament had not distinct and
known limits (sett by the gracious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions
of our Monarchs) each of
them would be ready to invade one anothers
Priviledges. And thus I conceive that if the
Parliament should consent to alienate the half
of the Kingdom, or to subject the whole to a
Stranger, as in King <hi>Johns</hi> case in <hi>England,</hi>
and the <hi>Baliols</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> it has been
found by the respective Parliaments of both
Kingdoms, that, that Statute would not
oblidge the Successor. Or if the House of
commons in <hi>England,</hi> or the Burrowes of
<hi>Scotland</hi> should consent to any Act exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
their Estate and respresentatives from
the Parliament, doubtlesse that Statute ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
them would not prejudge their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors;
because that Act was contrare to one
of the fundamental Laws of the Nation. And


<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59994:13"/>
the late Acts of Parliaments excluding
Bishops, were reprobated by the ensuing
Parliaments, as such; and therefore by the
same rule, any Statute made excluding the
legal Successor, would be null and voyd, as
contrare to one of the great Fundamental
Rights of the Nation. And what can be call'd
more a Fundamental Right than the Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of our Monarchy? Since our Monarchy
in this <hi>Isle,</hi> has ever been acknowledg'd to
be hereditary. And that this acknowledgment
is the great <hi>Basis</hi> whereupon most of all the
positions of our Law run, and are established:
such as, that the King never dyes, since the
very moment in which the last King dyes,
the next Successor in Blood is Legally King,
and that without any expresse recognizance
from the People, and all that oppose him are
Rebells, His Commissions are valide, He
may call Parliaments, dispose the Lands
pertaining to the Crown, all men are lyable
to do him homage; and hold their Rights of
him and his Heirs. And generally this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
runs through all the veins of our Law.
It is that, which gives life and Authority to
our Statutes, but receives none from them;
which are the undenyable marks and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
of a Fundamental Right in all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
But that this right of lineal Succession


<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59994:13"/>
is one of the Fundamental, and unalterable
Laws of the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> is clear,
by the Commission granted by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for the union in <hi>Anno</hi> 1604. <q>In which
these words are, his Majesty vouchsafeing,
to assure them of his sincere disposition and
clear meaning, no way by the foresaid Union
to prejudge or hurt the Fundamental Laws,
ancient Priviledges, Offices and Liberties of
this Kingdom; whereby not only the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cely
Authority of his most Royal descent
hath been these many ages maintain'd, but
also his Peoples securities of their Lands and
Livings, Rights, Liberties, Offices and
dignities preserv'd: Whilks if they should be
innovated, such confusion should ensue; as
it could no more be a free Monarchy.</q>
            </p>
            <p>6. There would many great inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
arise, both to King and People, by the
Parliaments having this power: For weak
Kings might by their own simplicity, and
Gentle Kings by the rebellion of their Subjects
be induced to consent to such Acts, in which
their Subjects would be tempted to cheat in
the one case, and rebell in the other. Many
Kings likewise might be wrought upon, by the
importunity of their Wives, or Concubins, or
by the misrepresentations of Favourits, to
disinherit the true Successor; and he likewise
to prevent this arbitrarienesse, would be oblid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>g'd


<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59994:14"/>
to enter in a faction for his own support,
from his very infancy. This would likewise
animate all of the Blood Royal, to compete
for the Throne, and in order thereto, they
would be easily induc'd to make factions in
the Parliament, and to hate one another;
whereas the true Successor would be ingadg'd
to hate them all, and to endeavour the ruine
of such as he thought more popular than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
Nor would the people be in better case,
since they behov'd to expect upon all these
accompts, constant civil warres and animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities,
and by being unsure whom to follow,
might be in great hazard by following him
who had no Right. And their rights bearing
to hold of the King and his Heirs, it would be
dubious to the vassals, who should be their
superiour, as well, as who should be their
King. It is also in reason to be expected, that
<hi>Scotland</hi> will ever owne the legal descent: and
thus we should under different Kings of the
same Race, be involv'd in new and constant
civil warrs; <hi>France</hi> shall have a constant
door open'd, by allyances with <hi>Scotland,</hi>
to disquiet the peace of the whole <hi>Isle;</hi> and
<hi>England</hi> shab loose all the endeavours it used
to unite this <hi>Isle</hi> within it self. Another great
absurdity and inconveniency which would
follow upon the exclusion of the lineal Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor


<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59994:14"/>
would be, that if he had a Son, that
Son behoov'd certainly to succeed; and
therefore after the next Lawful Heir were
brought from abroad to Reigne, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hov'd
to return upon the Birth of this Son;
and if he dyed he would be again call'd
home, and would be sent back by the Birth
of another Son: which would occasion such
affronts, uncertainties, divisions, factions,
temptations, that I am sure, no good nor
wise man could admit of such a project.</p>
            <p>I find also, that as the debarring the
Righteous Heir, is in reason, the fruitful seed
of all civil warr and misery, (for who can
Imagine that the Righteous Heir will depart
from his Right, or that wise men will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger
their lives and fortunes in opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to it?) so experience has demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
how dangerous, and bloody this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice
has prov'd. Let us remember amongst
many Domestick examples, the miseries
that ensu'd upon the exclusion of <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dredus</hi>
the Son of <hi>Lothus;</hi> the destruction
of the <hi>Picts</hi> for having secluded <hi>Alpinus</hi>

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59994:15"/>
of <hi>Arthur Duke</hi> of <hi>Britanny,</hi> true Heir
of the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> with many
other forreigne Histories, which tell us of
the dreadfull michiefs arising from <hi>Pelops</hi>
preferring his youngest Son to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Micene;</hi> from <hi>Aedipus</hi> comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

from <hi>Aristodemus</hi> admitting his
two Sons <hi>Proclus,</hi> and <hi>Euristhenes</hi> to an

            <p>7. If Parliaments had such powers as
this, then our Monarchy would not be he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary,
but elective; the very essence of
ane hereditary Monarchy consisting in the
right of Succession, according to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingency
of blood. Whereas if the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
can preferre the next, save one, they
may preferre the last of all the line: for
the next save one, is no more next than
the last is next. And the same reason by
which they can choose a Successor (which
can only be that they have a power above
him) should likewayes in my opinion ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
their deposing of Kings. And since the
Successor has as good Right to succeed, as
the present King has to Govern (for that
Right of blood which makes him first, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes
the other next, and all these Statuts
which acknowledge the present Kings Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives,
acknowlege that they belong to him
and his Heirs.) It followes clearly, that if
the Parliament can preclude the one, they


<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59994:16"/>
may exclude the other. And we saw even
in the last age, that such reasons as are now
urged to incapacitat the children of our last
Monarch, from the hope of Succession. <hi>viz.</hi>
Popery, and arbitrary Government, did
embolden men to Dethrone, and Murder
the Father himself who was actual King.</p>
            <p>8. That such Acts of Parliament, alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Succession are ineffectual, and null,
Is clear from this, that though such an Act
of Parliament were made, it could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barre
the true Successor: because by the Laws
of all Nations, and particularly of these
Kingdoms, the Right of Succession purges
all defects, and removes all impediments,
which can prejudge him who is to Succeed.
And as <hi>Craig</hi> one of our learn'd lawyers
has very well express'd it, <hi rend="margQuotes">Tanta est Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gii
sanguinis praerogativa, &amp; dignitas, ut
vitium non admittat, nec se contaminari
patiatur.</hi> And thus though he who were
to succeed, had committed murther, or were
declar'd a traitour formerly to the Crown
for open Rebellion against the King, and
Kingdom; yet he needed not be restor'd by
Act of Parliament upon his comming to the
Crown: But his very Right of blood would
purge all these imperfections. Of which
there are two reasons given by Lawyers,


<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59994:16"/>
one is, that no man can be a Rebel against
himself, nor can the King have a Superior.
And consequently, there can be none whom
he can offend. And it were absurd that he
who can restore all other men, should need
to be restored himself. The second reason
is, because the punishment of crimes, such
as confiscations, &amp;c. Are to be inflicted
by the Kings Authority, or to fall to the
Kings Thesaury; and it were most absurd,
that a man should exact from himself a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.
Likeas, upon this account it is,
that though in the Canon Law, Bastards
cannot be promov'd to sacred orders without
dispensation, nor can <hi>alibi nati,</hi> that is to
say, people born out of <hi>England</hi> be admitted
to succeed in <hi>England,</hi> by express Act of
Parliament there; Yet <hi>Agapaetus, Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus,
Gelasius</hi> and many others, have been
admitted to be Popes without any formal
dispensation, their election clearing that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection.
And the Statute of <hi>alibi nati,</hi>
has been oft found not to extend to the
Royal line.</p>
            <p>That the Succession to the Crown purges
all defects, is clear, by many instances, both
at home and abroad. The instances at home
are, in <hi>England Henry</hi> the VI. Being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sabled
and attainted of high treason by Act


<pb n="28" facs="tcp:59994:17"/>
of Parliament, it was found by the Judges,
notwithstanding that from the moment he
assum'd the Crown, he had Right to succeed
without being restored. And the like was
resolved by the Judges in the case of <hi>Henry</hi>
the VII, As <hi>Bacon</hi> observes in his History
of <hi>Henry</hi> the VII. fol. 13. And in the case
of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who was declar'd
Bastard by Act of Parliament, as is clear
by <hi>Cambden</hi> anno 2. <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> And though
in <hi>Scotland</hi> there be no express instances of
this, because though some Rebellious Ring-leaders
in <hi>Scotland,</hi> have often in a privat ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
been very injurious to their King; Yet
their Parliaments have been ever very ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of attainting the blood Royal, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptive
Heirs. But <hi>Alexander Duke</hi> of
<hi>Albanie,</hi> and his Succession being declared
traitours, by his Brother King <hi>James</hi> the
IV. his Son <hi>John</hi> was notwithstanding
called home from <hi>France</hi> upon his Uncles
death, and declar'd Tutor and Governour,
without any remission, or being restor'd:
that employment being found to be due
to him by the right of blood: therefore he had
been much more declared the true Successor
of the Crown if his Cousin King <hi>Iames</hi> the
V. had died.</p>
            <p>These being sufficient to establish our


<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59994:17"/>
design, I shall mention only some forraigne
stories.</p>
            <p>CHARLES the VII. of <hi>France</hi> who
though banish'd by Sentence of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Paris<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> did thereafter succeed to the
Crown. And though <hi>Lewis</hi> the XII. was
forfeited for taking up armes against CHAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LES
the VIII. Yet he succeeded to him
without restitution. And <hi>Lewis</hi> the II. his
Son being declared a Rebel, whom his
Father desiring to disinherit, and to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitut
in his place <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandie,</hi>
that Son had succeeded if he had
not been hindered by the Nobility, who
plainly told him it was impossible to exclude
his Sone from the Succession.</p>
            <p>My next task shall be to satisfy the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
brought for mantaining this opinion,
whereof the first is.</p>
            <p>That God himself has authorised the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
the Right of Succession, by the
examples of <hi>Esau, Salomon,</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>To which I answer, that these instances
which are warranted by express commands
from God, are no more to be drawn into
example, than the robbing of the <hi>Aegyptians</hi>
ear-rings. And it's needing an express com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
and the expressing of that command,
does evince, that otherwayes <hi>Iacob,</hi>


               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:59994:18"/>
nor <hi>Salomon</hi> could not have succeeded
against the priviledge of birth-Right and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session.</p>
            <p>The next objection, is that it is naturally
imply'd in all <hi>Monarchies,</hi> that the people
shall obey whilst the Prince Governs justly,
As in the paction betwixt <hi>David,</hi> and the
people 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5. Which is most suitable to the
principles of justice, and Government: Since
relations cannot stand by one side; so that
when the King leaves off to be King, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
a Tyrant, the people may consult
their own security in laying him aside,
as Tutors may be remov'd when they are
suspect. And that this is most just when
Kings are Idolaters since God is rather to
be obey'd then men.</p>
            <p>To all which it is answered, that God
who loves order, and knows the extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
levity, and insolence of men, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when baited by hope of prey, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion,
did wisely think fit to ordain under
the paine of eternal damnation, that all men
should be subject to Superiour powers for
conscience sake. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 13. and that whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
resists the power, resists God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 2.
reserving the punishment of Kings to himself,
as being only their Superiour. And thus
<hi>David, Asa,</hi> and others, committed


<pb n="31" facs="tcp:59994:18"/>
crimes, but were not depos'd, nor debart'd
by the people. Nor were even the Idolatrous
Kings such as <hi>Achab, Manasse, &amp;c.</hi>
judged by their subjects, nor did the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
exhort the people to rise against them,
though they were opposing Gods express,
and immediat will. And overturning the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contraverted
fundamentals of Religion. Nor
did the Fathers of the primitive Church, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
the Christians to oppose the Heathen,
and Idolatrous Princes, under which they
lived: and <hi>Paul</hi> commands them to pray for
these Heathen Emperours. Nor was the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
<hi>Basilicus</hi> depos'd for abrogating the
Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> as is pretended by
some Republicans, but was turn'd out by
the just Successor <hi>Zeno,</hi> whom he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
dethron'd. Nor were <hi>Zeno</hi> or <hi>Anasta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi>
degraded for their errors in Religion, or
their vices by the ancient Christians: but
were opprest by private faction. And sure
they must think God unable to redress him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
who without warrand, and against
his expresse warrand, will usurpe so high a
power. And we in this rebellious principle,
owne the greatest extravagancy with which
We can charge the Pope and Jesuits, and
disowne not only our own Confession of faith
which Article 1. <hi>Chap.</hi> 22. acknowledges,


<pb n="32" facs="tcp:59994:19"/>
               <hi rend="margQuotes">that infidelity, or difference in Religion
doth not make void the Magistrats just; or
legal authority, nor free the People from
their due obedience to him,</hi> but contradict
the best Protestant divines, as <hi>Musculus,
Melancthon</hi> and others <hi>vid. libell. de vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tand,
superstit.</hi> Anno 1150. <hi>&amp; Consil. Biden.
Dec. 1. Consil. 10. &amp; Decad. 10. Consil.</hi> 5.
nor can the subterfuge us'd by <hi>Buchanan,</hi>
and others satisfie, whereby they contend
that the former Texts of Scripture prove on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that the Office, but not the Persones of
Kings are Sacred<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so that Parliaments or
People may lay aside the Persons, though
not the Office, seing the Sacred Text secures
oftner the Person, than the Office as I have
formerly more fully prov'de. And if this
principle prevail'd as to the differences in the
Theory of Religion, it would in the next step
be urg'd as to the practice of Religion; and
we would change our Kings, because we
thought them not pious, as well as Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant.
And did not our Sectarians refine so
far, as to think dominion founded on grace?
and this opinion seems to my self more solide
than the other, for certainly an impious
Protestant, is a worse Governour, and less
Gods Vicegerent, and image, than a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
Papist. And amongst Protestants, every


<pb n="33" facs="tcp:59994:19"/>
Secte will reject a King, because he is not of
their opinion. And thus our Covenanters,
by the Act of the West-kirk <hi>Anno</hi> 1650. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd,
they would disown our present Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch,
if he did not own the Covenant. And
though a King were Protestant, yet still this
pretext that he design'd to introduce Popery,
would raise his People against him, if diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
in Religion could Lawfully Arme sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
against their King, or did empower
them to debar his Successor. And when this
cheat prevail'd against devout King <hi>Charles</hi>
the I, the Martyr of that Orthodox Faith to
which he was said to be enemie, what a mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is it to allow this fatall error, which was
able to ruine us in the last age, and went so
near to destroy us in this? This is indeed, to
allow that arbitrariness against our Kings,
which we would not allow in them to us.</p>
            <p>The second Objection is, that in <hi>England</hi>
the Parliament has frequently devolv'd the
Crown and Government upon such as were
not otherwayes to have succeeded, as in the
instances of <hi>Edward</hi> the II. and <hi>Richard</hi> the
III, the first of whom was most unjustly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd,
for making use of <hi>Gavestoun,</hi> and
the <hi>Spencers;</hi> which shewes how extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
the People ar in their humours, rather
than how just their power is: for besides, that


<pb n="34" facs="tcp:59994:20"/>
do not read, that these Counsellors were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufferable,
there is no good Christian that can
say, that a King can be depos'd for using ill
Counsellors. And as to <hi>Richard</hi> the III. his
case is so fully examined, and all the Articles
brought both against him, and <hi>Edward</hi> the
II. so fully answered by the learn'd <hi>Arnisaeus</hi>
a Protestant Lawyer, (and who had no other
interest in that debate than a love to Truth
and Law) in that treatise, <hi>Quod nullâ ex cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sâ
subditis fas sit contra legitimum principem
arma sumere,</hi> that we Protestants should be
asham'd to bring again to the field such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
upon which <hi>Arnisaeus,</hi> in answer to
the 14. Article against <hi>Richard</hi> the II, <hi>viz.</hi>
that he refus'd to allow the Lawes made in
Parliament, does very well remark, that this
was in effect to consent to their being King,
and to transferre upon them the Royal power,
and this will be the event of all such under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings.</p>
            <p>The instances of <hi>Henry</hi> the IV. and <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
the VII., are of no more weight than the
other two, since these were likewayes only
Kings <hi>de facto,</hi> till King <hi>Henry</hi> the VII. by his
marriage with the Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> eldest
Daughter to King <hi>Edward</hi> the IV., did by
her transmit a just title to his Successor:
&amp; therefore it was not strange, that either of


<pb n="35" facs="tcp:59994:20"/>
these should allow the Parliament to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
when they behov'd to owe to them the
possession of the Throne. But yet <hi>Henry</hi> the
VII. himself (as the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> relates in his
Historie) shunn'd to have the Parliament de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
his title to be just, being content with
these ambiguous words, <hi>viz. that the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance
of the Crown should rest, remain
and abide in the King, &amp;c.</hi> And upon this
accompt it was, that the same King caus'd
make a Law, that such as should serve the
King for the time, being in his warrs, could
not be attainted or impeach'd in their persons
or Estates.</p>
            <p>As to <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII. his procuring an Act,
whereby the Parliament declares that in case
he had no issue by the Lady <hi>Jean Seymour,</hi>
he might dispose of the Crown to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
person he should in his own discretion
think fit.</p>
            <p>It is answered, that by a former Statute in
the 25 year of his Reigne, he by Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
setles the Crown upon the Heirs
male of his own body, and for lack of such
issue, to Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and for lack of such
issue also, to the next Heirs of the King, who
should for ever succeed according to the right
of Succession of the Crown of <hi>England;</hi>
which shewes that the Succession to the


<pb n="36" facs="tcp:59994:21"/>
Crown of <hi>England</hi> is establish't by the Law
of Nature, and the Fundamental Laws of
<hi>England,</hi> upon the Heirs of Blood, according
to the proximity of degrees; so that though
that King did afterwards prevaile with the
Parliament to declare this <hi>Elizabeth</hi> a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stard,
as he did also his Daughter <hi>Mary,</hi> by
another Act, and resolve to setle the Crown,
upon <hi>Henry</hi> Fitz Roy, Duke of <hi>Richmond,</hi>
yet these Acts teach us how dangerous it is to
leave Parliaments to the impression of Kings
in the case of naming a Successor, as it is to
expose Kings to the arbitrariness of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
But such care had God of his own
Laws, that <hi>Mary</hi> succeeded notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
She was Papist, and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
her, though she was declar'd Bastard;
the Rights of Blood prevailing over the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities
of divorce, and the dispensations of
Popes: as the strength of Nature does often
prevaile over poisons. And God remov'd the
Duke of <hi>Richmond</hi> by death, to prevent the
unjust competition, and so little notice was
taken of this; and the subsequent Act <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no
1535,</hi> that the Heirs of Blood succeeded
without repealing of that Act, as ane Act in
it self invalide from the beginning: for only
such Acts are past by, without being repeal'd.
And <hi>Blackwood pag.</hi> 45. observes very well,


<pb n="37" facs="tcp:59994:21"/>
that so conscious were the Makers of these
Acts, of the illegality thereof, and of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
contrarie to the immutable Laws of God,
Nature and Nations, that none durst produce
that Kings Testament wherein he did nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat
a Successor, conform to the power gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by these Acts, that how soon they were
freed by his death from the violent oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
that had forced them to alter a Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor
three several times, and at last to swear
implicitly to whomever he should nominat,
(a preparative which this age would not well
bear though they cite it) they proclamed first
Queen <hi>Mary</hi> their Queen though a Papist,
and thereafter Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> whom
themselves had formerly declared a Bastard.
And as in all these Acts there is nothing decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Parliaments to have power to name
a Successor, but only giving a power to the
King, for preventing mischiefs; that might
arise upon the dubiousness of the Succession,
to nominat a Successor; two of the legal Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors
having been declar'd Bastards upon
some niceties, not of nature, but of the
Popes Bulls for divorcing their Mothers: so,
this instance can only prove, that the King
may nominat a Successor, and that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
may consent, not to quarrell it, (which
is all that they do) but does not at all prove,


<pb n="38" facs="tcp:59994:22"/>
that where the Right of Nature is clear, the
Parliament may invert the same. And stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
who considered more the dictats of Law
than of Passion, did in that age conclude, that
no Statute could be valide when made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trare
to the fundamental Law of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,

            </p>
            <p>There seems greater difficulty to arise from
the 13 <hi>Elizabeth</hi> c. 2. by which it is enacted,
that if any persone shall affirme, that the
Parliament of <hi>England</hi> has not full power
to bind and Governe the Crown in point
of Succession and descent, that such a persone,
during the Queens life, shall be guilty of
high treason.</p>
            <p>But to this Act it is answered, that this
Act does not debarre the next legal and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Successor. And these words, <hi>That the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
has power to bind and Govern the
Succession,</hi> must be, as all other general expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
in Statutes, interpreted and restricted
by other uncontraverted Laws; and so the
sense must be, that the Parliament are Judge


<pb n="39" facs="tcp:59994:22"/>
where there are differences betwixt Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titors
in nice and contravertable points
which cannot be otherwise decided: and both
this and the former Acts made in <hi>Henry</hi> the
VI. time, are not general Laws but tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarie
Acts and personal Priviledges; and so
cannot overturn the known current of Law.
<hi>Quod verò contrà rationem juris receptum
est, non est producendum ad consequentias.</hi>
And in all these instances it is remarkable,
that the restriction was made upon the desire
of the <hi>Soveraigne,</hi> and not of the Subject.
And if we look upon this Act as made to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
against <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and
to let her know, that it was to no purpose
for her to designe any thing against the
Right, or Person of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> as
being declar'd a Bastard, by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in <hi>England;</hi> since her other right as
next undoubted Heir by Blood to the Crown,
might be altered, or Govern'd: we must
acknowledge it to be only one of these Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,
which the Law sayes, are made <hi>ad
terrorem &amp; ex terrore</hi> only. Nor was there
ever use made of it by Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi>
nor her Parliaments; so fully were they
convinc'd, that this pretended power was so
unjust, as that it could not be justified by an
Act of Parliament, being contrair to the


<pb n="40" facs="tcp:59994:23"/>
Laws of God, of Nature, of Nations, and
of the Fundamental Laws of both Kingdoms.
But this Law being made to exclude Queen
<hi>Mary,</hi> and the <hi>Scotish</hi> line, as is clear by
that clause, wherein it is declared that every
Person or Persones of what degree or Nation
soever they be, shall during the Queens life
declare or publish, that they have Right to
the Crown of <hi>England</hi> during the Queens
life, shall be disinabled to enjoy the
Crown in Succession, inheritance, or
otherwayes, after the Queens death;
It therefore followes, that it was never valide:
For if it had, King <hi>Iames</hi> might have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
been excluded by that person who
should have succeeded next to the <hi>Scotish</hi>
race. For it's undeniable, that Queen <hi>Marie</hi>
did, during Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> life, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
Right to the Crown, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
that Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was declared
Bastard. And therefore the calling in of
King <hi>Iames</hi> after this Act, and the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
his title, does clearly evince, that
the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> knew, that they
had no power to make any such Act. The
words of which acknowledgement of King
<hi>James</hi>'s Right, I have thought fit to set
down, as it is in the statute it self, 1. <hi>Ja.
Cap.</hi> 1. <q>That the Crown of <hi>England</hi> did


<pb n="41" facs="tcp:59994:23"/>
descend upon King <hi>James</hi> by inherent
Birthright, as being lineally, justly, and
Lawfully next, and sole Heir of the Blood
Royal. And to this recognition they do
submit themselves, and posterities for
ever, untill the last drop of their Blood be
spilt. And further doth beseech his Majesty
to accept of the same recognition, as the
first Fruits of their Loyalty, and Faith to
his Majesty, and to his Royal progeny, and
posterity for ever.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It may be also objected, that by the 8,
Act. Parl. 1. <hi>Ja.</hi> 6. It is provided in <hi>Scotland,</hi>
that all Kings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Princes that shall happen

of eternal God, that they shall mantaine

of the Holy Word, and due and Right
Administration of the Sacraments now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
and preach'd within this Kingdom;
from which two conclusions may be inferr'd,
1. That by that Act the Successor to the
Crown may be restricted. 2. That the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor
to the Crown must be a Protestant,
that being the Religion which was Professed
and established the time of this Act.</p>
            <p>To which it is answered, that this Act re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates


<pb n="42" facs="tcp:59994:24"/>
only to the Crowning of the King, and
not to the Succession. Nor is a coronation ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutly

(2.) There is no clause irritant in this Act
debarring the Successor, or declaring the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
null in case his Successor gave not
this Oath. 3. The Lawfull Successor though
he were of a different Religion from his


<pb n="43" facs="tcp:59994:24"/>
People (as God forbid he should be) may
easily swear, that he shall mantaine the Laws
presently standing. And any Parliament may
legally secure the Successor from overturning
their Religion or Laws, though they cannot
debarre him. And though the Successor did
not swear to mantaine the Laws, Yet are
they in litle danger by his Succession; since
all Acts of Parliament stand in force, till
they be repeal'd by subsequent Parliaments:
And the King cannot repeale an Act without
the consent of Parliament. But to put this
beyond all debate, the 2. Act of this cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Parliament is opponed, whereby it is
declared, <hi>that the Right and administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Government is immediatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volv'd
upon the nixt Lawfull Heir after the
death of the King or Queen, and that no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
in Religion, nor no Law nor Act of
Parliament can stop or hinder them in the
free and actual administration;</hi> which is
an abrogation of the foresaid Act concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Coronation as to this point; for
how can the administration be devolv'd im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
upon the Successor, if he cannot
administrat till he be Crown'd, and have
sworn this Oath.</p>
            <p>The next objection is, that since the King
and Parl. may by Act of Parl. alter the Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of privat families though transmitted by


<pb n="44" facs="tcp:59994:25"/>
the Right of blood, why may they not alter
the Succession in the Royal family?</p>
            <p>To which it is answered, that the reason
of the difference lyes in this, that the Heirs
of the Crown owe not their Succession to
Parliaments: for they succeed by the Laws
of God, nature, and the Fundamental Laws
of the nation; whereas privat Families are
Subject to Parliaments, and inferiour to
them, and owe their privat Rights to a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicipal
Law, and so may and ought in point
of Right to be regulated by them. And yet
I am very clear, that a Parliament cannot
arbitrarly debarr the eldest Son of a privat
Family, and devolve the Succession upon
the younger: and if they did so, their Acts
would be null. But if this argument were
good, we might as well conclude by it,
that no persone born out of <hi>England,</hi> or
attainted of treason could succeed to the
Crown; Because he could not succeed to a
privat Estate. All which and many moe
instances do clearly demonstrat that the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor
to the Crown cannot be debarr'd, nor
the Succession to the Crown diverted by
Act of Parliament.</p>
            <p>The last objection is, that <hi>Robert</hi> the III.
King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> was by ane Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
preferr'd to <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Walter,</hi> who


<pb n="45" facs="tcp:59994:25"/>
(as he pretends) were truly the eldest
lawful Sons of <hi>Robert</hi> the <hi>2d.</hi> because <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan</hi>
Daughter to the Earl of <hi>Ross</hi> was first
lawful Wife to King <hi>Robert</hi> the <hi>2d,</hi> and she
bore him <hi>David</hi> Earl of <hi>Strathern,</hi> and
<hi>Walter</hi> Earl of <hi>Athol, Alexander</hi> Earl of
<hi>Buchan,</hi> and <hi>Euphan</hi> who was married to
<hi>James</hi> Earl of <hi>Dowglass,</hi> after whose de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceass
he married <hi>Elizabeth Muir,</hi> Daughter
to Sir <hi>Adam Muir;</hi> not so much (as <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanan</hi>
observes) from any design to marry
a second Wife, as from the great love he
carried to <hi>Elizabeth Muir,</hi> whom because
of her extraordinary Beauty he had lov'd
very passionatly in his youth, and before
he married the Earl of <hi>Rosses</hi> Daughter, and
from the love which he bore to the Sons
whom <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had born before that first
Marriage, who were <hi>John</hi> Earl of <hi>Carrick</hi>
(who thereafter succeeded to the Crown
by the Title of <hi>Robert</hi> the <hi>3d,)</hi> and <hi>Robert</hi>
Earl of <hi>Fife</hi> and <hi>Monteith,</hi> he prevail'd
with the Parliament to prefer <hi>John</hi> eldest
Son by <hi>Elizabeth Muir,</hi> to the two Sons
which he had by the Earl of <hi>Rosses</hi> Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
who was (as they pretend) his first
lawful Wife.</p>
            <p>In which though I might debate many
nice points of Law relating to this Subject,


<pb n="46" facs="tcp:59994:26"/>
yet I choose only to insist on these few
convincing Answers.</p>
            <p>1. That in a Case of so great moment
Historians should be little credited, except
they could have produc'd very infallible
Documents; and as in general one Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
may make all who succeed him err, so
in this Case <hi>Boetius</hi> (who was the first)
liv'd and wrot 200 years after the Marriage
of King <hi>Robert</hi> the <hi>2d,</hi> and wrot his Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
at <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> very remote from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisters
and Records by which he should
have instructed himself; nor did he know
the importance of this point, having touch'd
it only transiently, though it has been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'dly
press'd by <hi>Buchanan,</hi> to evince that
the Parliaments of <hi>Scotland</hi> might prefer
any of the Royal Line they pleas'd; and
it is indeed probable that King <hi>Robert</hi> the
<hi>2d.</hi> did for some time make no great noise
of his first Marriage with <hi>Elizabeth Muir,</hi>
least the meaness of the Match should
have weaken'd his Interest upon his first
coming to the Crown, he being himself the
first of the Race of the <hi>Stewarts,</hi> and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so strong Competitors as the Earl of
<hi>Dowglass,</hi> who claim'd Right to the Crown
in the Right of the <hi>Baliol</hi> and the <hi>Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings,</hi>
as <hi>Boetius</hi> himself observes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:59994:26"/>
2. King <hi>Robert</hi> the <hi>3d.</hi> having succeeded
as the eldest lawful Son, and having been
receiv'd as such by that Parliament, and his
Posterity by all succeeding Parliaments, the
Possession of the King and the Acquiescence
of the People is the most infallible proof
that can be adduc'd for proving that <hi>Robert</hi>
was the eldest lawful Son, nor have most
Kings in <hi>Europe,</hi> or the Heads of most pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Families any other proof of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the eldest and lawful Sons, save that
they succeeded and were acknowledg'd as
such.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>To ballance the authority of these
Historians, I shall produce the Testimonie
of the Learned Sir</hi> Lewis Stewart, <hi>one of
the most famous Lawyers we ever had, and
who ought much more to be believ'd than</hi>
Buchanan, <hi>not only because he was more
disinterested, but because he founds upon
Acts of Parliament and old Charters which
he himself had seen in the Registers, in
which</hi> Elizabeth Muir <hi>is acknowledg'd to
have been the first Wife.</hi> Buchananus lib.

Members of Parliament appended thereto,

maximo</hi> (his eldest Son) in <hi>Anno</hi> 1371,
which was the first year of his Reign; and
if the pretended defect be true, it was a
very palpable, and a very undenyable one,
and could not but have been unanswerably
known to the whole Nation. And how can
we imagine, that the whole Parliament
would have unanimously drawn upon
themselves so dreadful a Perjury, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
the lawful Heir, against their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Oath in the Reign of K. <hi>Kenneth</hi> the
<hi>3d,</hi> whereby they swore to own<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> always
the immediate Heir, or that they would
have entail'd upon themselves a Civil War,
by preferring even a questionable Heir, after
the Miseries which they had lately then felt,
in the competition betwixt the <hi>Bruce</hi> and


<pb n="50" facs="tcp:59994:28"/>
the <hi>Baliol<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Amongst which Seals, the Seal of
<hi>James</hi> Earl of <hi>Dowglass</hi> is one, and how ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
is it to think, that he would sit and
declare a Bastard preferable to the Brother
of his own Lady, and to his own Lady
who would have succeeded if her Brothers
had died without Succession: Which Act
of Parliament does also clearly prove, that
<hi>Buchanan</hi> did not at all understand matters
of Fact in this part of the History, for he
asserts, that after the death of <hi>Euphan Ross,</hi>
the King married <hi>Elizabeth Muir,</hi> and did
by Act of Parliament obtain the Crown to
be settled upon <hi>Robert</hi> the <hi>3d,</hi> Son to the
said <hi>Elizabeth Muir,</hi> upon whom he also
bestow'd the Title of <hi>Carrick;</hi> all which
is most false, for this Act of Parliament is
dated in <hi>Anno</hi> 1371, and King <hi>Robert</hi> the
<hi>2d.</hi> succeeded to the Crown that year, nor
did <hi>Euphan Ross</hi> die till the <hi>3d.</hi> year after he
succeeded to the Crown, and so not till
the Year 1374, and yet in <hi>Anno</hi> 1371 this
Act is past, designing him Heir to the
Crown, and Earl of <hi>Carrick,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
he was so design'd before the death
of <hi>Euphan Ross.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. I have seen a Charter granted by
King <hi>Robert</hi> the <hi>2d,</hi> when he was only
Steward of <hi>Scotland,</hi> granted in <hi>anno</hi> 1165,


<pb n="51" facs="tcp:59994:28"/>
and so long before he was King. In which
Charter likewise, <hi>John,</hi> thereafter King,
by the name of <hi>Robert</hi> the <hi>3d,</hi> is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct
Disponer with him, under the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press

Heir. Robertus <hi>Senescallus</hi> Scotiae, <hi>Comes de</hi>

which Charter confirms to the Abbacy of

by <hi>Reginaldus More,</hi> Father to Sir <hi>William
More</hi> of <hi>Abercorn.</hi> And I find that <hi>David</hi>
Duke of <hi>Rothsay,</hi> was always in the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
granted by his Father King <hi>Robert</hi> the
first, called <hi>Primogenitus,</hi> and he was no
Bastard, nor can this designation be given
to a Bastard, as is clear by <hi>Covar<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

how can it be imagined that the Monks of

person as Heir to the Crown, who was
not: for this would have infer'd Treason
against them, beside the annulling their
Right, or who could understand better
the lawfulness of a Marriage, than a body
of Church-men, living in the time, and
very near to the Residence of the married
Persons, and in whose Conventual-Church
the said King <hi>Robert</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth Muir</hi> ly
buried together.</p>

               <hi>Item,</hi> I have seen in the Registers ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Charter granted by King <hi>Robert</hi> the 2.
in the first year of his Reign, with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of <hi>John</hi> Earl of <hi>Carrick, primogenitus
&amp; haeres,</hi> Allano <hi>de</hi> Lavidia <hi>terrarum de</hi>

to <hi>Paulo M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>tire</hi> a Charter granted
by the Earl of <hi>Ross,</hi> Father to <hi>Euphan,</hi>
wherein the said <hi>John primogenitus &amp; hares,</hi>
is a Witness: And to shew that the said
<hi>Euphan Ross</hi> was then living when he was
so design'd Heir, there is a Charter to her
by the King upon the very same day of the
Lands of <hi>Lochleaven.</hi> As also, there is a
Charter granted by King <hi>Robert</hi> the <hi>2d,</hi>
the first year of his Reign, to <hi>Alexander</hi>
his Son, and another to <hi>John Kennedy</hi> of
the Barrony of <hi>Dalrymple,</hi> in both which
the said <hi>John</hi> Earl of <hi>Carrick</hi> is call'd <hi>primo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitus,</hi>
and is Witness with the Earl of
<hi>Dowglass;</hi> so that he has been design'd
eldest Son and Heir, openly, uncontra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertedly,
and in all Papers, and with the
consent of the second Wife and her Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>6. In the Parliament 1372, the said
<hi>John</hi> Earl of <hi>Carrick</hi> is design'd to be Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
of the Kingdom, and all the Estates


<pb n="53" facs="tcp:59994:29"/>
of Parliament swear to own him in his
Government, and which Statute is printed
amongst the Satutes of King <hi>Robert</hi> the <hi>2d,</hi>
Father to the said <hi>John,</hi> and which must
be during the Marriage with <hi>Euphan
Ross,</hi> for she liv'd three years after her
Husband was King, and he succeeded to
the Crown <hi>anno</hi> 1371: And this also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes
<hi>Buchanan,</hi> who asserts, that he was
created Earl of <hi>Carrick</hi> after the death of
<hi>Euphan Ross,</hi> and it is against all sense and
reason to think that he could have been
acknowledg'd during her life, if he had
not been the true Apparent Heir of the
Crown and a lawful Son.</p>
            <p>7. <hi>Walter</hi> (who they pretend should
have succeeded to the Crown,) having
kill'd his Nephew King <hi>James</hi> the first,
Son to King <hi>Robert</hi> the <hi>3d;</hi> He was not
only not own'd after the death of the said
King <hi>James,</hi> as certainly he had been if
his Title had been good, and his Right so
recent and demonstrable, having so many
great and powerful Relations, that his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was induc'd upon their account to
marry his Mother; but yet the said <hi>Walter</hi>
was by all the Parliament unanimously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd
as a Traitor, for having conspir'd
the death of his lawful Prince. Nor does


<pb n="54" facs="tcp:59994:30"/>
               <hi>Boetius</hi> justifie <hi>Walter</hi>'s Title in the least,
but on the contrary, magnifies the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for their just Sentence. As did like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<hi>Aeneas Silvius</hi> the Popes learned
Legat, who exhorted the Parliament to
condemn him.</p>
            <p>8. How is it imaginable, that King <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi>
who had so lately, and after a strong
competition come to the Crown, would have
adventur'd to make his Title yet more dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable,
by preferring a Bastard to the
true Heir, who had so many Friends by
his Mother, and who being an Infant had
never disoblig'd him.</p>
            <p>9. If we will consider the opinion of the
<hi>Civilians,</hi> whom we and almost all Nations
follow in the Cases of Succession, we will
find, that the said King <hi>Robert</hi> the <hi>3d</hi> was
the eldest and lawful Son of King <hi>Robert</hi>
the <hi>2d. filius legitimus, &amp; non legitimatus.</hi>
For, 1. They conclude, that a Son is prov'd
to be a lawful Son by the Assertion of the
Father, <hi>Alciat tract praesumpt. Reg. 2, prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumpt.
2. num.</hi> 6. and certainly the Father
is the best Judge in such Cases; but so it is
we have the Father owning the said <hi>Robert</hi>
the <hi>3d.</hi> to be his eldest Son and Heir, both
in Charters and Acts of Parliamnets, which
are the most solemn of all Deeds. 2. <hi>Quando

I know that <hi>Buchanan</hi> does most bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
inveigh against those Laws made by

            <p>To which my answer is, That in this
<hi>Buchanan</hi>'s Malice contradicts his History,
for his own History tells us, that the <hi>Scots</hi>
swore Allegiance to <hi>Fergus</hi> and his Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
and consequently <hi>Fergus</hi>'s Son ought
by Law to have succeeded, and not his
Brother, for his Brother was none of his
Posterity, and therefore those Laws made
by K. <hi>Kenneth</hi> did but renew the old Law,
and the innovation introduc'd in favours
of the Uncles, was a subversion of the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
Law to which they had sworn.
2. That the old Law was not abrogated,
but was in Being by vertue of the first
Oath, appears very clear by <hi>Buchanan</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
who confesses, that upon the death
of <hi>Durstus,</hi> a wicked Prince, it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated
whether his Son should not succeed


<pb n="57" facs="tcp:59994:31"/>
               <hi>juxta sacramentum</hi> Fergusio <hi>prestitum vete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remque
esse morem servandum,</hi> which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth
that the Succession was even
in these days established by Law, by Oath,
and by Custom; and after the death of
<hi>Fergus</hi> the <hi>2d,</hi> his Son <hi>Eugenius</hi> (though
a Minor) was crown'd, and his Uncle
<hi>Graemus</hi> allow'd to be his Tutor. And
<hi>Buchanan</hi> also brings in Bishop <hi>Kenne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
lib.</hi> 12. praising this Law as made by
<hi>Kenneth,</hi> a most wise and glorious Prince,
with advice of all his Estates of Parliament;
and which rather confirms (as he says) the
old Law than introduces a new one, so
far did <hi>Buchanan</hi>'s rage against Queen <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
prevail with him, to praise and rail at
the same individual Law; and it is observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
that it is very dangerous to recede
once from fundamental Laws, for <hi>Buchanan</hi>
makes not only the Succession Elective,
but he makes no difference betwixt lawful
Children and Bastards, and excludes not
only Minors during the Uncles life, but Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
for ever. 3. In all Nations where the
Monarchy is Hereditary, Minors succeed,
and so this innovation of causing the next
Male succeed for all his Life, was contrary
to the nature of the Monarchy and to the
Customs of all Nations, and God in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture


<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59994:32"/>
gives us many instances of it: <hi>J<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>as</hi>
succeeded when he was seven years of Age,
<hi>Josiah</hi> when he was eight, <hi>Manasseh</hi> in
twelve, and <hi>Azariah</hi> in sixteen; and yet
in those days, God is said to have chosen
the King, for it is said in <hi>Deut. Thou shalt
set over thee, the King whom I have chosen,</hi>
and consequently the choice of Minors can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be ill, since God Almighty us'd to
make such a choice. I know that <hi>Eccless.</hi>
10. 16. says, <hi>Woe unto the land when thy
King is a child,</hi> but the Criticks interpret
this of a King that is childish, <hi>puen intellectu
&amp; moribus,</hi> or because Factions arise by the
opposition to his Regents, and this incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency
did more necessarily attend the
allowing a Regent King during Life, for
both the Subjects and the true Heir rais'd
Factions in that Case, whereas the Subjects
only are factious in the other, and yet even
they are no more factious for that short
time, than they are always in Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths.
4. The reason why the Minor
King was to have one to supply his Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
ceasing with his Majority, it was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable
that the Remedy should have
lasted beyond the Disease, and the worst
effect that could have been occasion'd by
the Infant King's Minority was, that the


<pb n="59" facs="tcp:59994:32"/>
Kingdom should have been during that
time govern'd by joynt advice of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
Councils, and Officers of State,
which in <hi>Buchanan</hi>'s opinion in other places
of his History and Book <hi>De Jure Regni,</hi> is
so excellent a Model, that he decrys Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy
as much inferior to it. 5. It was
most inconvenient to accustom any private
Family to live in the quality of a King.
6. It could not but occasion many Murders,
and much Faction, for the true Heir could
not live peaceably under this Eclipse and
Exclusion, nor could the Uncle live without
making a Party to secure his pleasant
Usurpation. 7. As these Divisions and
Factions were the natural and necessary
Effects that were to be expected from this
irregular Succession, so it is very observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
that from King <hi>Fergus</hi> to King <hi>Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth</hi>
the <hi>3d,</hi> we had 79. Kings, amongst
whom, almost the half were the most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious,
tyranical, or lazie Kings that ever
we had, according to <hi>Buchanan</hi>'s character
of them; so happy and wise a thing is this
(so much magnified) Election of a Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor
by the People and their Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
to supply the defects of the lawful
Heir, whereas from King <hi>Kenneth</hi> the <hi>3d,</hi>
to King CHARLES the <hi>2d, inclusivè,</hi> we


<pb n="60" facs="tcp:59994:33"/>
have had 3<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. Kings, 26. of whom have suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
by a due lineal Right, and have
prov'd vertuous Princes, greater by their
Merit than their Birth, as if God had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
to let us see, that though most of
them succeeded whilst they were very
young, yet that he can choose a fitter Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor
than Parliameuts can do; whereas
the other 5. Kings who came to the Crown
against that Law of <hi>Kenneth</hi> the <hi>3d, viz.
Constantine</hi> the bald, <hi>Grimus, Mackbeath,
Donal Bain,</hi> and <hi>Duncan</hi> the <hi>2d,</hi> were all
persons who deserved very ill to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
to the true Heir, and who, as they
came to the Crown against Law, so govern'd
without it: And it is very strange, that
the <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> who think that every throw
of the Dice is influenc'd by a special Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
will not allow, that God does by
a special Providence take care who shall
be his Representative, who shall be the
Pastor of his Flock, and nursing Father of
his Church; let us therefore trust his Care
more than our own, and hope to obtain
more from him by Christian Submission,
Humility and Obedience than we can by
Caballing, Rebelling, and Sacrilegious-Murdering,
or Excluding the true Successor.</p>

            <p>To which my reply is, That these words
must be so constructed, as that they may
not be incosistent with his former clear and


<pb facs="tcp:59994:34"/>
Orthodox Doctrine, of not resisting Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Powers, the former being his posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Doctrine, and this but a supervenient
Caution, and they do very well consist<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
for though <hi>Calvin</hi> be very clear, that
Kings cannot be resisted, yet he thinks
that this is only to be mean'd of those
Kings who have no Superiors to check
them by Law, as the Kings of the <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians</hi>
had, who by the fundamental
Constitution of their Monarchy, might have
been call'd to an accompt by the <hi>Ephori,</hi>
and so in effect were only Titular Kings:
Or of such Monarchs as had only a co-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
Power with the States of their own
Kingdom; and even in these Cases, he does
not positively assert, that these Monarchs
may be resisted, but does only doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>if there be any such Superior or co-ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Magistrate representing the People</hi> they
may not restrain the Rage and Licentious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of their Kings: But that Caution does
not at all concern the <hi>Jus Regni apud Scotos,</hi>
because this cannot be said of the Kings of
Great <hi>Britain,</hi> since the States of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
are only call'd by the King, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
their Authority from him, and the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislative
Power is solely in the King, the
States of Parliament being only Consenters,


<pb facs="tcp:59994:34"/>
he and not they can only make Peace and
War, and grant Remissions, and against
him and not them Treason only is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and the Law Books of both Nations
do affirm, that the King is Supream, and
consequently even according to <hi>Calvin</hi>'s
Doctrine, neither his People, nor any of
their Representatives, can justly oppose,
and much less punish him.</p>
            <p>I know that <hi>Grotius</hi> is by the Republi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans,
and the Fanaticks, oft-times cited to
defend this their Doctrine, of opposing
Princes; but though his Testimony might
be justly rejected, as being himself born
under a Commonwealth, yet he is most
impudently cited, for he <hi>lib. 1. cap.</hi> 4. does
positively lay down as a general and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
Rule, that <hi>Summum imperium te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nentibus,
resisti non potest, Those who have
the Supream Power cannot lawfully be resisted;</hi>
whilch Rule he founds upon the Principles
of Reason, the Authority of Scripture, and
the Practice of the Primitive Church; and
though he limits the same thereafter by
some exceptions, yet it will easily appear,
that these exceptions extend not at all to
our Case.</p>
            <p>For the first relates only to such Kings,
as have receiv'd their Power with express


<pb facs="tcp:59994:35"/>
condition, that they may be try'd by other
Magistrats.</p>
            <p>The <hi>second</hi> to such as have voluntarily
resign'd their Empire, as <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>5th.</hi>
did; and so the one may be oppos'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they were only Titular Kings: and
the other, because they left off to be Kings,
and consequently we are concerned in nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of these Cases.</p>
            <p>The <hi>third</hi> limitation is only in the Case
where he who was truly a King, has alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
his Kingdom to Strangers; In which
Case, <hi>Grotius</hi> does contend, that Subjects
may refuse to obey, because he ceaseth to
be their King. But as this is not our Case,
so even in that Case <hi>Grotius</hi> is very clear,
that if this alienation be made by an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary
Monarch, the alienation is null,
as being done in prejudice of the lawful
Successor, but he does not at all assert that
the Monarch may be thereupon depos'd by
his People.</p>
            <p>The <hi>fourth</hi> relates only to such Kings, as
from a hatred to their Countrey, design
its Destruction and utter Ruine; but as he
confesseth himself, <hi>Id vix accidere potest in
Rege mentis compote;</hi> and consequently can
take only place in a mad Man, in which
Case all Laws allow the Kingdom to be


<pb facs="tcp:59994:35"/>
rul'd by Governours, and Administrators
in the King's Name, if the Madness be Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,
and a total depravation of Sense.
But if by Madness be mean'd a moral Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and design to ruine the Kingdom and
the Subjects, as was, and is most impiously
pretended against King CHARLES the first,
and King CHARLES the <hi>2d,</hi> the best and
most reasonable of Kings; then Opposition
in such Cases is not at all warranted by
<hi>Grotius,</hi> who speaks only of a Physical and
Natural Madness; for else, every thing
that displeaseth the People should be call'd
Madness; and so the exception should not
limit but overturn the general rule, and
should arm all Subjects to rebel against
their Princes, and make them the Soveraign
Judges in all Cases. Which is inconsistent
with <hi>Grotius</hi>'s own Doctrine, and is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently
refuted by his own Reasons.</p>
            <p>The <hi>fifth</hi> relates only to Kings, who by
the fundamental Laws of the Kingdom are
ty'd to such and such Conditions, so as that
if they fail in them, they may be oppos'd.</p>
            <p>The <hi>sixth</hi> relates only to Kingdoms
where the Power is equally devided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the King and the Senate.</p>
            <p>The <hi>seventh</hi> is incase the King was at first
invested by the People, with express re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation


<pb facs="tcp:59994:36"/>
to them to resist in such and such
Cases, and so is almost the same with the
<hi>fifth,</hi> and all these three differ little from
the <hi>first.</hi> And with <hi>Grotius</hi> good leave,
they err also in this, that they are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
exceptions from his own rule, for the
rule being only, that Supream Powers can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be resisted, these Powers are not Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream,
and they needed not be caution'd
by an exception, since they did not fall
under the rule. But neither of these Cases
extend to us, since our King is by the
Acts of Parliament fomerly cited, declared
<hi>to be Supream over all Persons and in all
Causes,</hi> nor made our Predecessors any such
express reservations at the first erection of
the Monarchy, and consequently by <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
own positive Doctrine cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted.
And so far is <hi>Grotius</hi> an enemy to
such Fanatical Resistance, upon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of Liberty and Religion, that <hi>num.</hi> 6.
he calls the Authors of these Opinions,
Time Servers only. And <hi>Gronovius</hi> a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Republican and Fanatick, taxes him
extreamly for it, in his Observations upon
that fourth Chapter, whose Arguments
adduc'd against <hi>Grotius</hi> I shall answer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the other Objections.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:59994:36"/>
               <hi>Gronovius</hi>'s first Argument why it should
be lawful to resist the Supream Magistrate
in defence of Religion, is, because if it be
not lawful for Subjects to Arm themselves
for Religion against their Prince, it should
not be lawful for their Prince by the same
rule to defend himself against <hi>Turks</hi> and
<hi>Infidels,</hi> who would endeavour to force
him to comply with their Impieties. But
to this it is answered, That Resistance to
Superiors is expressly discharg'd by the
Laws of God and Nature, as said is, but
this cannot be extended to Cases where
there is no Subjection nor Allegiance; and
it may be as well argu'd, that because one
private man may beat another who offers
to strike him, that therefore a Child may
beat his Parent, or a Servant his Master,
or that because I may violently resist a
private man who offers to take away my
Goods unjustly, that therefore I may op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the Sentence of the Magistrat, because
I forsooth do not think the same just.</p>
            <p>His second shift is, That our Saviour
commanded only absolute submission with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
resistance in the Infancy of the Church
when he himself was miraculosly to assist
his own Servants, but this Submission was
to end with the Miracles, to which it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated.


<pb facs="tcp:59994:37"/>
As to which, my answer is, 1. That
all the Commands in Scripture may be so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded,
nor is there any Duty more frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and fully inculcated than this is, and
that too in the same Chapters amongst other
Duties, which are to last for ever, such
as submission to Parents, and Masters, and
this is founded upon plain reason and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency,
and not upon Miracles. 2. This
was receiv'd and acknowledg'd by the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans,</hi>
as has been fully prov'd, though it
cannot be pretended that they rely'd upon
any such miraculous assistance. 3. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be deny'd but the Fathers of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Church did recommend and justifie
themselves in their Apologies to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Emperors for bearing patiently, when
they were able not only to have resisted,
but to have overthrown their Persecuters,
as is clear by the Citations out of <hi>Tertullian,
Cyprian, Lactantius, Augustine,</hi> and others,
to be seen in <hi>Grotius, De Jure Belli,. lib. 1.
cap. 4. num.</hi> 7. And it had been great impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
as well as sin in them, to have boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of a recent matter of Fact, which was not
true; nor could there be a greater injury
done to the Primitive Christians, as <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
observes, than to ascribe that to their
Weakness, which they consider'd as an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect


<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59994:37"/>
of Duty; and why should the Heathen
Emperors have suffered those to multiply,
who obey'd only because Disobedience was
not safe, for they might have certainly
concluded, that by the same Principle that
they obeyed only because they were weak,
they would disobey how soon they were
able. 4. If the first Christians in general
had obeyed only because they were not
able to resist, then any private Christian
had resisted when he was able, or would
have fled or conceal'd himself, whereas it
it acknowledg'd in the other Answer press'd
by <hi>Gronovius</hi> himself, that they sought for
Martyrdom, and so these two Answers are
inconsistent; and the <hi>Thebean Legion,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
did submit themselves voluntarly to
Martyrdom with their Arms in their hands,
and when they were able to have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown
the Emperor. And <hi>lastly,</hi> If this
Doctrine were allow'd, no Society could
subsist, for when Dissenters grew strong,
the lawful Magistrat behov'd to perish;
whereas Jesus Christ did contrive the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion; so as that all Governours
should reasonably wish their Subjects to be
Christians; and so as no Christian should at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
to overthrow the order and establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Civil Government, and that they


<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59994:38"/>
should not be drawn away from the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of Christian Devotion by the carnal
desires of being great and strong in the
World, nor have any hopes in the Arm
of Flesh to the lessening of their immediate
dependence upon him.</p>
            <p>His third shift is, That his Doctrine of
Submission and of dying for the Christian
Religion without making Resistance, was
only the Practice, but not the Command
of the Primitive Church, and proceeded
from their immoderat affection of the
Crown of Martyrdom, as <hi>Milntoun</hi> also
pretends. But since the express Command
of Scripture is founded upon such clear
Reason, and since (as <hi>Grotius</hi> well observes)
the Practice of the Primitive Christians,
who liv'd so near the Age wherein these
Scriptures were pen'd, is the best Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter
of the Scripture, it is horrid Impiety
to make those blessed Martyrs pass for
vain Hypocrites, and distracted Self-mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers;
and it becomes us with holy reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to imitate those whom the Christian
Church has ever admir'd.</p>
            <p>The fourth shift is, That the Protestant
Churches have been reform'd by such In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrections
as these, contrary to the Royal
Authority. But this is fully answered by


<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59994:38"/>
the learned <hi>Henry More</hi> in his <hi>Divine Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues,</hi>
and by <hi>Du Moulin</hi> in his <hi>Philanax
Anglicus;</hi> where likewise are to be found
the many Testimonies of Protestant
Churches, and Protestant Divines, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
positively the taking up of Arms
against the Soveraign Power, even for the
defence of Religion; and the very <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian
Confession of Faith at Westminster,</hi> is
so positive as to this point, that the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians</hi>
themselves can never answer it. The
sum of which answer is, That the King of <hi>Spain</hi>
coming by Marriage in place of the Duke
of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> the said King of <hi>Spain</hi> could
pretend to no more power than they had,
nor could the House of <hi>Burgundy</hi> pretend
to any more power by marrying the Heirs
of the Counts of the several Provinces, than
these Counts had over their Provinces; and
therefore since none of these were Soveraigns
over their Provinces, the Provinces might
have resisted the King of <hi>Spain</hi> when he
oppress'd them; and consequently that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
cannot defend such as resist Supream
Powers upon pretence of Religion, <hi>Grotius

            <p>The opposition made by the Protestants
in <hi>France,</hi> was not occasion'd by Religion,
but upon a Quarrel betwixt the Princes of

            <p>The Opposition made by the Princes of

to that purpose; nor would he engage in

            <p>The War that arose in <hi>Switzerland,</hi> was
not occasion'd by Religion; for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation

of the Magistrat. And the Erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

and are condem'd by <hi>Rivet,</hi> a famous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Divine, who also inveighs bitterly
against this Principle, <hi>Castiga Not. in Epist.
ad Balsac. cap. 13. num. 14. sub finem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From all which, I observe, First, That
all the Protestant Divines by making Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies
for such of their Profession as have
risen in Arms against Supream Powers,
must be thereby concluded to be asham'd
of the Principle. 2. Immediatly upon the
quieting those Rebellions, all the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Churches have in their <hi>Confessions of
Faith,</hi> declared their abhorrence of that
Principle; which being the product of
Conviction and Experience, joyn'd with
Duty, must be the most judicious and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
Testimony of all others. 3. All these
Rebellions have been occasion'd by a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
in point of Law, and not in point of
Religion; for the Divines, as I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated,
have been abused by the Lawyers:
And therefore, since in the Isle of <hi>Britain,</hi>
the Laws of both Kingdoms have declared


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59994:40"/>
the Rising in Arms against the King, to
be Treason, albeit for the defence of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
it necessarily follows, that this must
be unlawful in point of Conscience in this
Kingdom. 4. Though good things may
be occasion'd by a Rebellion, yet that does
not justifie a Rebellion; for though <hi>Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi>
was allow'd by God to rise against
<hi>Rehoboam,</hi> yet God Almighty himself calls
his revolt Rebellion, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 12. 19. and
2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 10. 19. and it is observable, that
after this Revolt, there was but one good
King amongst all the rebellious Kings of
<hi>Israel;</hi> whereas amongst the Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi>
who were lawful Kings, there was but one
or two who were any ways impious; so
far does God bless a lawful Succession.</p>
            <p>Some also use as a shift against this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox
Doctrine, that the reason why the
Primitive Christians did not oppose their
Emperors in the defence of the Christian
Religion, was, because they had not been
secured at that time in the Exercise of their
Religion by the Laws of the Empire; and
therefore the practice of those Christians
can be no Argument why we may not now
rise to defend the Orthodox Religion, since
it is now established by Law. But this
Objection is fully answered by that great


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59994:40"/>
great Antiquary <hi>Samuel Pelit. Diatriba de
Iur. Principum edictis Ecclesiae quaesito,</hi> where
he clearly proves, that they were actually
secured by the Edicts of the Emperors in
the days of the Emperor <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and
downward, and yet they would not rise
in Arms though they were persecuted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
these same Emperors, because the Word
of God and the Christian Religion did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
Obedience under Persecution, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
Resistance and taking up of Arms.</p>

            <p>I have also seen in <hi>Fordon</hi>'s History, <hi>lib. 14.

the Bishops, with the consent of <hi>Robert</hi> his
Nephew, and his Sons giving power to the
Bishops to dispone in Testament upon their

<hi>John</hi> Earl of <hi>Carrick,</hi> thereafter King <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi>

the <hi>2d.</hi> his eldest Son and Heir, but
the attestation of the Grand-Uncle King
<hi>David,</hi> who could be no ways byassed in
the Affair; and here he is ranked before
the three eldest Earls in the Nation, who
were then the three first Subjects therein;
and it is against all Sense, to think that the
whole Bishops would have sought the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of the said <hi>John</hi> as Apparent Heir of
the Crown, if he had not been Apparent
Heir. I find also, that <hi>Fordon</hi> calls him
when he is crown'd King, <hi>Primogenitus
Roberti secundi;</hi> nor was there the least
opposition made to his Coronation, nor to
the Coronation of <hi>Annabella Drummond</hi>
his Queen (a Daughter of the House of
<hi>Stob-hall,</hi> now <hi>Pearth,)</hi> though both the
Sons of the second Marriage were then
alive. I sind also, that <hi>Boetius</hi> himself ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges,
that the Earl of <hi>Marches</hi>
Son <hi>George,</hi> being pursu'd for hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
married clandestinly one of the
Daughters of <hi>Elizabeth Muir,</hi> his defence
was, that he married her when she was
the Daughter of a private Subject, and
before King <hi>Robert</hi> was King, whereas if
she had been only a Bastard-Daughter, it
could have been no Crime to have mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
