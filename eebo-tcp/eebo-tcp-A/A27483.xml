            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Title of this Book informs the Reader, That it contains the Acts and Negotiations of the General Peace concluded at <hi>Ryſwick,</hi> and likewiſe of the particular Peace concluded at <hi>Turin,</hi> faithfully Tranſlated from the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal publiſh'd at the <hi>Hague:</hi> The Editors of it in Engliſh thought they had good Reaſon to put it into that Language, becauſe Our Nation hath, in this long and bloody War, contributed ſuch mighty Weights to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the reducing the Kingdoms and States of <hi>Europe</hi> to the happy Ballance they at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent enjoy.</p>
            <p>The Efforts of the Engliſh Nation, in Concurrence with the Illuſtrious Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, have, in Nine Years time, broke thoſe <hi>Chains,</hi> which coſt the Expence of above 30 Years in their Contrivance, and by which the Liberty of <hi>Europe</hi> was ſo ſtrangely and artificially entangled and encompaſs'd, that even <hi>well-meaning Men</hi> thought it more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſable patiently to ſubmit to the inſuperable
<pb facs="tcp:52056:3"/>
Evil, than by vain Attempts to haſten or exaſperate the Miſery; <hi>Let the Lyon ſleep, ſay they, and let us by our Gentleneſs and Flatteries engage him ſo to do; Time may leſſen or wear out that Rage, which, ſhould we provoke, we are not able to reſiſt.</hi> Thus while evil Men che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh'd, and unthinking and miſtaken Men ſubmitted, the mighty Miſchief grew and proſper'd: Like ſome irreſiſtible Fleet it commanded and aw'd even thoſe diſtant Countries, that had not yet ſeen or felt its Power. <hi>Roman</hi> it was in the Wiſdom and Conduct of its Arms, but of how far different a Spirit from that Heroick Common-wealth? who with Hardſhips to themſelves conquer'd and ſubdu'd Nations, with the ſame tender Deſigns we chaſtiſe our Children, only to make 'em better and more happy than they were before.</p>
            <p>In this diſconſolate Poſture was <hi>Europe,</hi> not expecting Safety, the Delay of its Ruin ſeem'd to proceed but from the Pleaſure or Frolick of the Conqueror; when Crown'd Heads and States were <hi>bid</hi> to hope for that <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,</hi> which they before only durſt ſecretly deſire. This great Deſign is laid by a Prince, whoſe Deſcent ſeem'd to entitle him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Deliverer: His Anceſtors, of the ſame Name, reſcu'd his Country from Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers not indeed ſo well founded and numerous, but ſtill as deſtructive, as theſe the diſtant Nephew was to engage with; Providence
<pb facs="tcp:52056:3"/>
foreſaw the Protection of Seven Provinces would not be Work enough for ſo capacious a Soul: Hero's, through each degree, collect and gather their Anceſtors Perfections, to which they add their own, therefore <hi>This Prince</hi> is to be ally'd to the Engliſh Crown, that this Tie might engage him to extend his Care to theſe Iſlands, which by the <hi>ſupine Negligence</hi> and <hi>ſuperſtitious Bigottry</hi> of <hi>Governors</hi> had been put into equal, if not more eminent Danger, than the reſt of the Neighbouring World. Impotence was <hi>their</hi> Excuſe, we had Power, but the Force and Edge of it was turn'd upon our Selves. A Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Flood, that with miſerable great Deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had over-run part of <hi>Europe,</hi> was with additional Force too near approaching to us: What Precaution did we uſe to prevent it? Our Workmen were digging down the Banks that ſhould oppoſe and keep it out, and ſeem'd to invite the Ruin. Here this <hi>Great Prince</hi> interpoſes; he opens the Eyes of moſt, and holds the Hands of thoſe unfortunate Men that ſtill continu'd blind or engag'd, and kindly hinder'd 'em from doing Things, that tended to the Deſtruction of both Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their Country. Then in 1688. the mighty Scene opens, in 1689. the War begins. Power or Heaven for ſome time ſeem'd to favour the <hi>Mighty Monarch,</hi> doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it was to try the Oppoſer's Conſtancy and let them know, That no Diſaſters or
<pb facs="tcp:52056:4"/>
Diſappointments ſhould diſcourage Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, founded upon the Principles of Juſtice and Common Safety. Then for Four or Five Years the Bloody Game ſeem'd doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and the making of a Stand look'd like a Preſage of Victory: For when Powers that aſſume to themſelves the Titles of <hi>inſuperable Strength</hi> and <hi>immortal Glory,</hi> meet with Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, and are check'd in their ambitious Progreſs; this caſts Diſparagement upon their high Pretences, and makes ſuffering Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind hope they are not ſo great as they would willingly look to be: Like Men that affect the Character of being Rich, Couragious or Religious, yet are not really ſo, this aſſumed Shape may for ſome time command Awe and Reſpect, but when at laſt, by the Effects, the Diſguiſe appears, the Hypocrites become more contemptible and ridiculous. I ſhall not ſay, That the Events of the Two or Three laſt Years of the War make it appear probable, this was the Caſe of the Enemies of our Monarch and Country, for they had Subſtance, Conduct and Courage; though I muſt take it to be as plain, that their Power and theſe Qualifications were by no means equal to the Union form'd againſt 'em, and manag'd by the ſame <hi>Incomparable Head and Hand</hi> that firſt gave it Birth. For when <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy</hi> left the Confederacy in 1696. one would have thought ſo conſiderable a Weight taken out of our Scale, would have given the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb facs="tcp:52056:4"/>
a mighty Advantage; and the coſtly and even mean Flatteries and Cares that were employ'd to detach that Prince, and the Triumphs us'd on that Succeſs, ſhould confirm the Opinion: But what Effect had it? None to the Advantage of our Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. Some caſual Deficiencies at Home de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated the Deſigns abroad, otherwiſe our Enemies might in this laſt Interval have felt more Evils, then, I hope, we ſhall ever now have occaſion to wiſh to 'em. For the <hi>Great King</hi> condeſcends that the Houſe of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty ſhall become the Place of Treaty for Peace, and there ſettles to the <hi>Empire</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> Barriers ſo firm and ſtrong, that their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies cannot by Force, in Ten Years, recover what was by Agreement reſtor'd to 'em here, except groſs Negligence, Treachery or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord open their Gates, which are Evils the Poſſeſſors only can provide againſt. For, in the preſent Circumſtances of <hi>Europe,</hi> all any ſingle State ſhould reaſonable wiſh, is, to be in a Condition to prevent Surprize from a Neighbourhood, and to have a Power ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to defend it ſelf <hi>for ſome time</hi>; and then doubtleſs thoſe Potentates whoſe Intereſt it is, that the Aggreſſor ſhould not, by the Ruin of another, grow too powerful, will come to the Aſſiſtance of the Oppreſſed: For the late celebrated League does demonſtrate, That the Groſs of Mankind ſeldom vary from their Intereſt, when they know it and
<pb facs="tcp:52056:5"/>
are at Liberty to act as they have a Mind to; and this makes it probable <hi>France</hi> would never have ſubmitted to Terms ſo diſadvantagious to her Power, if ſhe ſuddenly intended the like Exerciſes of it, that have been practis'd ſome Years before: Therefore the Reader may reaſonably hope the Duration of this Peace will add to the Glory of it; he will admire the Contriver of that wonderful Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine, that made and forc'd a way for it; he will wiſh the Hero a long Enjoyment of it, and this is for every Engliſh Man's own Intereſt; for it may be this Peace carries ſomething in it reſembling the Nature of Creation, its continuance may in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure depend upon the Being of its Maker.</p>

                     <p>IT was not poſſible for me ſooner to ſatisfy his Royal Highneſs's Deſire of knowing the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages which the King is pleaſed to grant him, in caſe his Royal Highneſs conſents to joyn with his Majeſty, either to procure a Peace or a Neutrality in <hi>Italy,</hi> becauſe I had then no
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52056:8"/>
Orders to explain my ſelf, farther than what was mentioned in the Two Letters I have had the Honour to write to you. But as ſoon as I had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven his Majeſty an Account of the Anſwers you made, he gave me leave to be more plain, and that in Writing too, altho' it be not uſual to lay open Matters of this Conſequence in Letters, eſpecially ſince I know that his Royal Highneſs will certainly communicate them all to his Allies. But, methinks, the Contents of this I now write to you are of ſuch Importance that they ought to be managed with greater Privacy. However, I am allowed to add thus much to what I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready writ to you, That the King is diſpoſed to reſtore <hi>Pignerol</hi> to his Royal Highneſs, together with all the Dependencies which did formerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Houſe of <hi>Savoy</hi>; yet ſo, as that all its Fortifications ſhall be demoliſhed. But in caſe the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> ſhould be unwilling to agree to this Neutrality, neither will ſuffer <hi>Italy,</hi> nor the Dominions of his Royal Highneſs eſpecially, to be in Peace, ſuch Meaſures will then be taken, as ſhall oblige them to it. And to that End his Royal Highneſs ſhall joyn his Forces with his Majeſty's, giving the King only ſuch Security as ſhall be thought reaſonable. His Majeſty moreover will afford greater Demonſtrations of Amity to his Royal Highneſs, and Kindneſs to the Houſe of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy,</hi> for his Majeſty intends to match the Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> to the Princeſs of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and to take her into <hi>France,</hi> where they ſhall be immediately contracted, but the Conſummation of their Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage is to be deferred till they both come of Age. His Majeſty likewiſe to ſatisfy his Generoſity is willing to give her a Portion, and allow her a Dowry, without putting his Royal Highneſs to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52056:8"/>
any more Coſt or Charges on her Account. On theſe Effects of his Majeſty's Bounty will depend many other Advantages in Favour of his Royal Highneſs, provide he expreſſes himſelf but wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to lay hold on theſe Offers in the Anſwer he ſhall order to this Letter. But in caſe of Non-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance, I aſſure you, his Majeſty will be ſo far incenſed to ſee his kind Proffers ſlighted, that his Royal Highneſs muſt expect no more Favour, but to be treated as an obſtinate Enemy, although it ſhould be never ſo prejudicial to the King. I am perſuaded that his Royal Highneſs will make ſuch due Reflections on this Affair as the Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of it, in reſpect to his own Intereſt requires, I am, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

ſelf, whoſe Fortifications are to be demoliſhed, the Importance of which Place your Holineſs is well acquainted with. A Marriage is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo propoſed between the Princeſs, my Daughter, and the Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> to be conſummated when they are of Age, and in the mean time ſhe is to be received and conducted into <hi>France,</hi> where the King aſſigns her a Dowry, and gives her a Portion without putting me to the leaſt Charges, beſides many other Advantages, (which I need not here mention) on Condition that I ſhall concur to ſettle a Neutrality in <hi>Italy.</hi> But if the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> ſhould delay giving their Conſent to it, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being thereunto exhorted by your Holineſs and the Republick of <hi>Venice</hi>; in ſuch caſe, I am to joyn my Forces to thoſe of <hi>France,</hi> in order to make them comply. Having made ſerious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections on this Matter, and thinking that the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> can have no Intentions to force me to reject theſe advantagious Offers made me by <hi>France,</hi> I have taken a Reſolution to let the Principals of the Confederacy know that I cannot poſſibly let ſlip this preſent favourable Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of recovering <hi>Pignerol</hi>; neither can I think it proper to commit a Matter of ſo great Importance to the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> to all <hi>Italy,</hi> and to my ſelf, to the uncertain Event of War and Futurity.

The happy Succeſſes which have accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied my Arms, have been the more agreeable to me; becauſe I have always Flatter'd my ſelf they would Conduce to a Peace; and I have made no other Profit of thoſe Succeſſes, than to offer my Enemies Conditions more Advantagious then they could hope for, even tho' they had obtain'd that
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:52056:23"/>
Superiority over me, as I have gain'd upon them.

My Vows have been heard; this Prince has at laſt acknowledg'd his true Intereſt and my good Intentions, and the Peace is Concluded. It is to be hoped, that the Confederated Powers, touch'd by this Example, and the Evils that their People ſuffer, will follow his Example: Or if they will ſtill perſiſt in the ſame Sentiments, they ſhall more than ever be made ſenſible, that nothing is impoſſible to Troops accuſtomed to Victory, and which are Conducted by a Deſire of Peace.

                     <p>The Conferences began on the Ninth of <hi>May</hi> in the Afternoon.

The Baron of <hi>Preilmeyer</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador and Plenipotentiary of the Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> arriv'd about four a Clock in a Coach with ſix Horſes, having his Son and two Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with him.

The Emperor's Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors arrived afterwards with five Coaches, each drawn by ſix Horſes; they had three Coaches more with two Horſes each; Two Grooms rid before them in Count <hi>Kaunitz</hi> Livery. In the two firſt Coaches were Monſieur <hi>Hayeck</hi> Secretary of the

The Ambaſſadors of <hi>France</hi> arrived at three quarters paſt Four, with three Coaches drawn by ſix Horſes each; Monſieur <hi>de Harley,</hi> the Count <hi>de Crecy,</hi> and Monſieur <hi>de Callieres,</hi> with Monſieur <hi>de Harlay</hi> Counſellor of State, were in the firſt; a Gentleman on Horſeback riding before them.

The Biſhop of <hi>Liege</hi> to have <hi>Dinant</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored. This is the Method of Treating that was demanded of <hi>France,</hi> and which is very commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable. But as it has been found neceſſary to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire this Security beforehand (which has been termed a Prelimenary) I find it neceſſary to inſiſt upon it, that the ſame may be done, in regard to the Reſtitution of <hi>Lorain.</hi> Not according to the Terms of the Treaty of <hi>Nimeguen</hi>; becauſe a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution on ſuch Conditions, is not to be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of; and the Queen, both as a Mother and a Guardian of her Children, cannot allow of it, and ſhe cannot act contrary to the Duke, her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's Deed, who was never willing to accept of a Reſtitution on thoſe Terms. Neither ought that Treaty of <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> to ſtand as a Prelimenary or a Foundation of this Treaty, ſince the King of <hi>France</hi> himſelf, has in a manner diſanulled it, by declaring by his Ambaſſadors, that it was as if it had never been; and the deceaſed Duke of <hi>Lorain</hi> on his part, made a Declaration, That he would not be held by it. Nevertheleſs, that pretended Treaty, to which he had never conſented, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed unto, nor ſigned by his Plenipotentiary, but on the contrary proteſted againſt, has been concluded notwithſtanding his Diſſent: How then can that Treaty be revived without him, and made uſe of it againſt an Auguſt Widow, and Four moſt Serene Orphans, whereof the eldeſt is Duke <hi>Leopold</hi> of <hi>Lorain,</hi> the firſt of that Name, deſcended of Sixty Seven Dukes of a continued Line, of ſo illuſtrious a Blood, that there is no King nor Prince in <hi>Europe,</hi> now living, but has drops of it in his Veins, and even the moſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian King himſelf. Whence it cannot be imagin'd, that his Majeſty could be willing that this moſt
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:52056:32"/>
Serene Family, which has in former times render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch ſignal Services to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> ſhould be now deſtroyed and brought to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. By the Laws of Nature, for the Sake of the Quality of this Illuſtrious Houſe, and by the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of Alliances, the High Confederates ought to ſupport its Cauſe. The Emperour hath made a Solemn and Authentick Treaty with the States General of the United Provinces, in which there is an expreſs Article, importing that the Dukedoms of <hi>Lorain</hi> and <hi>Barr,</hi> with all the Dominions and Countries thereunto belonging, ſhall be fully reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the late Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> of Glorious Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. He was then alive, and contributed very much to promote that Treary; and if that Article which related to him had not been admitted to be comprehended in it, that Treaty would have never been concluded nor ratified. Mynheer <hi>Hop,</hi> who was one of the Publick Miniſters concerned in it, and ſigned it, knows this to be true. And the States General have the Subſtance of what I have been ſaying, in their own Records.</p>
                     <p>The Monarchy of <hi>Spain,</hi> the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and other conſederated Powers conſented to that Treaty, did concur in it, or rather run to take upon them the common Defence of it, and enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged themſelves into the ſame Obligation to ſee this Article relating to <hi>Lorrain</hi> duly performed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they gave their particular Aſſurances. There was no Elector, Prince, or State of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire that oppoſed it; on the contrary, the Three Colledges gave their Votes and Reſolutions for this Reſtitution to be made to the full, and with allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for Damages. Theſe are the Engagements of the high Allies for the Houſe of <hi>Lorain,</hi> againſt
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:52056:33"/>
which, <hi>France</hi> does peremptorily declare, by Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Caillieres,</hi> That the King will not reſtore <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain,</hi> but on the Conditions mentioned in the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Nimeguen.</hi> Does there need more Arguments to move the Allies to cauſe the Reſtitution of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain</hi> to be put among the Prelimenaries, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Tenour of their Obligations? Before Monſieur <hi>Caillieres</hi> had declared this Negative, he gave us ſome Ground to hope by what he had ſaid at <hi>Meaſtricht</hi> and elſewhere, that <hi>Lorain</hi> would be reſtored on certain Conditions, or on Terms more Advantageous than thoſe of the Treaty of <hi>Nimeguen.</hi> Theſe Advantages were then to be Part of the Preliminaries, in order to draw on this Treaty. But that thoſe fair Promiſes were to be taken but for meer Complements, appears at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent plain enough, by this abſolute Negative of his, <hi>viz. The King will not</hi>: Which may give ſufficient Warning to the Allies, to make uſe of more Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution in their Tranſactions, and this obliges them the more to make this ſo juſt a Reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution part of the Prelimenary, aad that without it the Congreſs ſhould not be held.

                     <p>MY Age and ill Diſpoſition of Body will not permit me to wrangle, nor uſe many words, and therefore all I ſhall ſay is, That we are come hither to make a Peace, and not to Diſpute or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate Ranks and Places. Every one yields the firſt to the Emperor only, and no Body diſputes it with him, no not our Enemies themſelves. We have, with common Conſent, and by the Intervention of our Mediator, made an Act of Reſervation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the ſeveral Titles; which Act has been thought very Prudential and Neceſſary; for it is a Precedent, and at the ſame time ſecures all other Pretenſions of Place and Precedency which every one may arrogate to himſelf. For my part, I do not intend to take place of any Body: But at the ſame time I will not ſuffer any thing to be done that can prejudice the Queen my Miſtreſs, or the moſt Serene Duke her Son, who is a Sovereign, and that's enough. Otherwiſe I ſhall call my ſelf a Repreſentative of the King of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>; There ſhall come another that will entitle himſelf King of <hi>Cyprus</hi>; Their Lordſhips the States General will call themſelves Kings of ſeveral Kingdoms in the <hi>Indies</hi>; for they are ſo indeed; but that is not the queſtion: <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> as I ſaid before, we are not here to diſpute or regulate what is <hi>de gloria mundi,</hi>
                        <pb n="50" facs="tcp:52056:34"/>
but only and ſolely to Treat of the Peace, which ſhall be concluded, and God Almighty will ſend, if we have it firſt among us the High Allies.</p>
                     <p>The under-named Miniſter and Plenipotentia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Lorain,</hi> not to be tedious in the Congreſs of the Peace, and concur in it according to the wiſe direction propoſed by his Excellency the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor Mediator, and agreed on by all Parties now in War, claims from, and in the Name of the Queen his Miſtreſs, in Quality of Mother and Guardian of the moſt Serene Duke of <hi>Lorain</hi> and <hi>Barr Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pold</hi> Firſt of the Name, her Son a Minor, and of three other Princes his Brothers, all under Age, all four her Sons and lawful Iſſue by the moſt Serene Duke of <hi>Lorain</hi> and <hi>Barr,</hi> lately deceaſed, of glorious Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, her Husband; the ſuccinct and general De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand here annexed, which her Majeſty has made herſelf, and Signed with her own Hand; which Monſieur <hi>Caillieres,</hi> then Miniſter of <hi>France,</hi> and now Extraordinary Ambaſſador and Plenipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiary in this Congreſs having ſeen and peruſed, did not think improper to be preſented to his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, by means of a Copy of it, which the Sieurs <hi>Boreel</hi> and <hi>Dyckvelt,</hi> Miniſters of their Lordſhips the States General, and now their Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotentiaries and Extraordinary Ambaſſadors in this ſame Congreſs, treating together, have given him. Which demand therefore cannot be more anthentick, nor ſuit better with a moſt great and mighty King, to work upon his Magnanimity and Juſtice, the Effect which that Auguſt Queen expects for her four moſt Serene Orphans. With a Proviſo to add to it hereafter, what may concern their lawful Rights and Pretenſions.</p>

                     <head>A Regulation touching Publick Ceremonies and Order among Domeſticks, drawn up by his Excellency the Mediator.</head>
                     <p>WE the Baron of <hi>Lilieroot,</hi> Extraordinary Ambaſſador and Plenipotentiary of his Sacred Royal Majeſty of <hi>Sweden,</hi> for the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of Peace, make it known and declare, That all the moſt Illuſtrious and moſt Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Lords Ambaſſadors and Plenipotentiaries, who come to the Conferences which are held here for the Peace, have unanimouſly conſented to, and approved the Propoſal We have made of revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and cauſing to be obſerved on this Occaſion, the Regulations heretofore made at <hi>Nimeguen</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Ceremonies and Orders, with ſome Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or Alterations which We have thought fit to be made, in order to make them more proper and ſuitable to this Place and preſent Conjuncture, and that upon mature Deliberation the following Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles have been agreed upon.</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <pb n="52" facs="tcp:52056:35"/>I. That all Notifications of the Arrival of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors and Plenipotentiaries, and all Viſits, as well to be made and received, as to be paid and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, and which may require ſome Ceremony, ſhall be entirely left off and ſuppreſſed, and it ſhall be free to all to ſee and viſit one another, when, and in what manner they pleaſe, but ſo that ſuch Viſits ſhall not be exacted as a Duty, or be a Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent for the time to come. However, thoſe that ſhall come hereafter, in order to their Admittance to the Conferences, ſhall be obliged to Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate their full Powers to his Excellency the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador Mediator, who ſhall Impart it to their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies the Ambaſſadors and Plenipotentiaries of the Allies that ſhall be of the Aſſembly; and it ſhall not be lawful for the New Comers to be there preſent, before the ſame be perform'd.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. That the Ambaſſadors and Plenipotentiaries ſhall come to the Place of the Conferences with no other Retinue than a ſmall number of Gentlemen, one or two Pages at moſt, and very few Footmen; that they ſhall ſuffer no other Coach than that of their Bodies to come into the Court of the Palace; and if they had occaſion for one or two Coaches more for their Attendants, theſe laſt ſhall ſtand with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, that they may cauſe no Confuſion or Stop: The ſame ſhall alſo be obſerved in all other Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Places, where there may happen to be a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Concourſe of People, as at Plays, Publick Feaſts, Balls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">III. That care ſhall be taken to prevent Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels on both ſides betwixt Coachmen and other mean Servants, who ſhall alſo be commanded to uſe
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:52056:35"/>
one another with Reciprocal Civility and Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and to be ready in doing one another all ſorts of mutual Services and good Turns upon all Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. That the Gentlemen of the Retinue of the Ambaſſadors ſhall take care that the ſaid Servants do exactly obſerve the preſent Regulation as to that Particular, and ſhall cauſe thoſe to be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed who ſhall act contrary to it.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. That the Ambaſſadors and Plenipotentiaries who aſſiſt at the Conferences from the Emperor and the Allies, ſhall come into the Court of the Houſe where the Conferences are held, by the Gate made on purpoſe on the ſide of the ſaid Houſes that looks towards the <hi>Hague,</hi> and ſhall go up to their Apartments by the Stair-Caſe on the ſame ſide; and the Ambaſſadors of the moſt Chriſtian King ſhall make uſe of the Gate and Bridge lately made, on the ſide of <hi>Delft,</hi> as alſo of the Stair-Caſe adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Apartments, on the ſame ſide; and the Ambaſſador Mediator ſhall go alone over the Bridge and through the Gate of the middle, and ſhall go up to his Apartments by the great Stair-Caſe.</p>
                     <p n="6">VI. If two Coaches happen to meet in a place too narrow for them both to go through at the ſame time, inſtead of diſputing the Wall, and thereby cauſing any Stop, the Coachmen on the contrary ſhall be oblig'd to open and make the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage eaſie reciprocally, as much as poſſible; and he who ſhall have the firſt notice of the Difficulty given him, ſhall ſtop and make room for the other, if it appears that he can do it more eaſily on his ſide.</p>

                        <pb n="54" facs="tcp:52056:36"/>VII. In Publick Walks, ſuch as the <hi>Voorhout</hi> and <hi>Malls,</hi> there ſhall be obſerved the Cuſtom eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed among thoſe that meet there, which is to keep the right hand every one on his ſide, as well as in the Streets and Publick Ways, and in general, wherever it may conveniently be done, without the leaſt Conteſt or Affectation of Precedence.</p>
                     <p n="8">VIII. The Pages, Footmen, and generally all Livery-Servants, ſhall carry neither Sticks nor Arms, ſuch as Swords, Knives, Pocket-Piſtols, or others of whatſoever kind they may be, either hid or openly, both in Town as in the Walks, and when they go to <hi>Ryſwick.</hi> However, the Pages ſhall be allowed, if they will, ſmall Sticks. Moreover, all Domeſticks ſhall be forbid to go out of their Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in the Night, unleſs it be by expreſs Orders from their Maſters, ſo that none may be found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad upon any other account, at unſeaſonable hours; and thoſe that ſhall go contrary to this ſhall be ſeverely puniſhed, and turned out forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.</p>
                     <p n="9">IX. When any Servant of an Ambaſſador or Plenipotentiary ſhall ſtand Convicted of any Crime capable of diſturbing the Publick Tranquility, the Ambaſſador or Plenipotentiary to whom he ſhall belong, ſhall wave his Right and Priviledge of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing him himſelf, and withdrawing his Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, ſhall cauſe him to be delivered into the hands of the ordinary Judge of the Place where the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence ſhall have been committed, either in the Town or elſewhere, and ſhall even proſecute the Offender according to the eſtabliſhed Laws: And if in the ſame Caſe the Criminal Judge, vulgarly call'd <hi>Schout,</hi> ſhould Arreſt and take any one in
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:52056:36"/>
the Fact, either himſelf, or by his Officers, or others, it ſhall be lawful for them to ſeize ſuch a Perſon, and even commit him to Goal, although they known him to be Servant, or of the Retinue of ſome Ambaſſador or Plenipotentiary, till they can give Notice of it to his Maſter, which they ſhall be obliged to do forthwith, and without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay. After which, what the Ambaſſador or Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotentiary ſhall order, ſhall be punctually put in Execution, whether he deſires to have his Servant kept in Priſon, or ſet at Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                     <p n="10">X. If any Domeſtick of an Ambaſſador or Plenipotentiary ſhould Inſult or Quarrel with a Domeſtick of another Ambaſſador or Pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potentiary, the Aggreſſor ſhall forthwith be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered up into the Power of the Maſter of him that has been attacked and inſulted, who ſhall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh him as he ſhall think fit.</p>
                     <p n="11">XI. All Ambaſſadors and Plenipotentiaries ſhall moſt ſeverely and ſtrictly forbid their Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks, as well Gentlemen as others, to have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them any Quarrels or Differences; and if any ſhould be diſcovered notwithſtanding theſe Prohibitions, and that any one ſhould be ſo bold, as to endeavour to decide them by the Way of Arms, he ſhall inſtantly be turn'd out of the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors Houſe, and even out of the Town, without any regard to what he could alledge for his Excuſe; as the Enormity of the Affront put upon him, or his being Aſſaulted firſt; and he ſhall likewiſe be obliged to Anſwer to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint that may be made before the Tribunal of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:52056:37"/>
his Natural Prince, where he ſhall be puniſhed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Laws.</p>
                     <p n="12">XII. All the foregoing Articles agreed on with common Conſent, for the good Order of this Aſſembly, ſhall not be alledged for an Example, or be a Precedent in any other Place, Time, or dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Conjuncture; and no Perſon ſhall take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage from, nor receive Prejudice by them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any other occaſion.</p>

urg'd, and the French agreed, that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire and Emperor ſhould not be ſeparated, but be joyn'd together according to ancient Cuſtom, and as it was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd in the Treaty of the Twenty years Truce made at <hi>Ratisbonne:</hi> That it was requiſite, not only to expreſs what might conduce to the preſerving the Peace, in order to obſerve it; but likewiſe to take notice of what might obſtruct or deſtroy it, in order to avoid it.

                           <p>It is very true, if things be duly conſider'd, that the Treaty of <hi>Weſtphalia</hi> and that of <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> may and ought to be reckon'd one and the ſame: ſince the former is ſo ratified and confirm'd by the latter, as if the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of the <hi>Weſtphalian</hi> Treaty, were inſerted word for word in the Treaty of <hi>Nimiguen,</hi> unleſs in ſuch caſes wherein the former was abrogated by the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: ſo that in effect, by promiſing to renew the one, it was likewiſe promiſed to renew the other.

                           <p>The former part of the Third Article has been already diſcuſſed in the Second. What follows is part of the Reſtitution to be made by the enſuing Peace.

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:52056:42"/>
the whole Body of the Decree, concerning the detaining and poſſeſſing of other Territories at that time acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd, do ſufficiently manifeſt the ſtate of things by the then Treaty of <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> and the time enſuing. This likewiſe was evident, and particularly in the Right pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to <hi>Strasburgh, Landau,</hi> and <hi>Cronweiſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg,</hi> by receding from performance of the Peace of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meguen,</hi> the firſt Article whereof was drawn up in theſe Terms.</p>
                           <p>The Emperor ſhall forthwith cauſe his Forces and Troops to withdraw from all the Provinces of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, which do not by an Hereditary Right belong to the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> namely from the Circle of <hi>Suabia</hi> and <hi>Franconia,</hi> as well as from the Electoral Circle of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and from that of the Upper <hi>Rhine,</hi> and from the Towns and Forts ſituated thereon, From <hi>Bon, Strasburgh, Offenberg, Hockberg, Landau, Cron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weiſſemberg,</hi> and in general from all ſuch places, as neither by the Treaty of <hi>Munſter,</hi> nor by that of <hi>Nime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guen</hi> belong'd to his Imperial Majeſty, ſo that immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately before the Tenth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> the ſaid Forces ſhall be drawn into <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and into other of his Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial States.</p>
                           <p>Therefore 'tis evident that <hi>Bon, Strasburgh, Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg, Landau, Cronweiſſemberg,</hi> and all the other Places of the Empire, which were not look'd upon as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing by an Hereditary Right to the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> neither by the Treaty of <hi>Munſter,</hi> nor that of <hi>Nime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guen,</hi> were yet conſider'd and abſolutely eſteem'd to be part of the Empire, and comprehended in its Circles and Dependencies. From whence it plainly follows, that by the Articles propos'd by the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors, all theſe Places are to be reſtor'd and re-eſtabliſh'd. Since the Caſe ſtands thus, and theſe Places are the Chief of what ought to be reſtor'd, the Emperor's Ambaſſadors, and thoſe of the Electors, Princes, and other States here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,

do reaſonably hope that there will be leſs difficulty about the other Articles to be agreed upon for the ſpeedy Re-eſtabliſhment of a firm and laſting Peace, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they deſire that an immediate Conſent may be given to the two following Articles, as the Foundation and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Rule of the preſent Peace.</p>

                     <p>THE happy Succeſſes with which it has pleas'd God to bleſs the Undertakings of the King in this Campagn, might give his Majeſty a very juſt occaſion of reducing within a narrow compaſs the Overtures which he has made for the Peace, the Term which he fix'd for the accepting of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions being expir'd, leaves him at his full Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſo that he might very well propoſe new Articles, but the ſame deſire which he always had of putting an end to the Miſeries of Chriſtendom, is ſtill the only Rule which he propoſes to himſelf, and his Majeſty is pleas'd to make no farther uſe of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages he has had, than for the more ſpeedy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhment of the Quiet of <hi>Europe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>'Tis with this deſign that the King declares, that tho' his Majeſty was free from his Engagements at the end of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> tho' he is very ſenſible what Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit he could reap from the Conqueſt of <hi>Barcelona,</hi> and from other Events of the War, yet the ſole In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt which influences and weighs moſt with him, is the univerſal Welfare of <hi>Europe</hi>; that for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting thereof by a ſpeedy Peace, his Majeſty makes uſe of that Liberty which he has at preſent only to alter ſuch of the Articles which he has propos'd, as ſeem to retard the Publick Tranquility.</p>
                     <p>Upon this account his Majeſty forbears offering to the Emperor the choice of taking <hi>Strasburgh,</hi> or the Equivalent propos'd for that City: he is reſolv'd to keep it, and no farther mention ſhall be made of an Alternative Equivalent: at the ſame time he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes that this Alteration, which he thought requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:52056:60"/>
to determine the Emperor, ſhall make no change in the other Conditions which he formerly offer'd for the keeping of <hi>Strasburgh</hi>; and conſequently that Town and the Citadel in the condition they now are, ſhall be for ever annex'd to his Crown, with the Dependencies of <hi>Strasburgh</hi> on this ſide the <hi>Rhine,</hi> ſuch as are on the other ſide of that River ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd to their proper Owners, with the ſame Rights and the ſame Prerogatives which they formerly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd: That the Fort of <hi>Keil</hi> ſhall be reſtor'd to the Emperor and Empire, in the ſame Condition as it is at preſent: That the Forts of the City, of the Iſlands in the <hi>Rhine,</hi> ſhall be raz'd: That the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Friburgh, Briſack,</hi> and <hi>Philipsburgh</hi> ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd by his Majeſty to the Emperor, upon the ſame Conditions ſet down in the Project deliver'd in by his Majeſty's Ambaſſadors Extraordinary to the Ambaſſador Mediator of <hi>Sweden:</hi> That thoſe Articles which ſpecifie the Reſtitution of <hi>Lorrain</hi> in the ſame Condition as Duke <hi>Charles</hi> poſſeſſed it in the year 1670. with the Clauſes therein explain'd, and which his Majeſty has thought neceſſary for the maintenance of the Peace, ſhall be punctually put in Execution: That laſtly, for rendring the Peace ſolid, and to aſſure the Empire, that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's only deſire is to preſerve it, he promiſes to demoliſh and abandon the Fortreſſes which he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes on the other ſide the <hi>Rhine,</hi> to pull down the Bridges made by his Orders upon the River, reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving only part of the Bridge of <hi>Fort Lewis</hi> on the <hi>Rhine,</hi> which leads from <hi>Alſace</hi> to the Fort: That he on the other hand demands that the Bridge of <hi>Philipsburgh</hi> be broken down, the Fort rais'd at the end of that Bridge on the ſide of <hi>France</hi> demoliſh'd; and that the <hi>Rhine</hi> being for the future the juſt Barrier between the Territories of both, the Ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues

of his Kingdom ſhall be ſhut up, at the ſame time, that his Majeſty makes it appear that he is not willing to reſerve any Paſſage whereby to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the War into <hi>Germany.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Laſtly, His Majeſty adds to thoſe conſiderable Overtures which he makes for the keeping of <hi>Straſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> the Reſtitution of <hi>Barcelona,</hi> which his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty promiſes to reſtore to the King of <hi>Spain</hi> aſſoon as he has the Conſent of the Emperor and Empire for the Surrender of <hi>Strasburgh:</hi> and this is all the uſe which his Majeſty pretends to make of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of one of the moſt conſiderable Towns in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchy.</p>
                     <p>His Majeſty propoſes no Alterations in the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles by which he offer'd to Treat with the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick King, and is perſwaded that this Prince being ſenſible of the Moderation which he ſhews towards him, will not inſiſt upon the Demand of a few Villages in the Seigniory of <hi>Aeth,</hi> requiſite for the more eaſie Commerce of the Inhabitants of <hi>Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay,</hi> and for the Communication of that City with the Town of <hi>Condé</hi>; and that his Majeſty pretends to reſerve to himſelf all the Advantages he can reap from the taking of <hi>Aeth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But whereas it is not reaſonable that his Majeſty ſhall be always oblig'd to Sacrifice ſuch conſiderable Advantages to the good of the Peace, he declares that if his Enemies defer taking advantage of thoſe new Expedients which he is pleas'd to offer for the Concluſion of the Treaties, &amp; ſhall exceed the term which he hereby gives them of the 20<hi>th</hi> of <hi>September</hi> to accept of his Propoſals, he will then be at liberty to propoſe new Conditions; and the Miſeries of the War are to be charg'd only on thoſe who refuſe to concur with his Majeſty to the putting an end to them.</p>

THere ſhall be henceforward and for ever, a conſtant, firm and ſincere Peace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the King and his Kingdom; and his Royal Highneſs the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> and his Dominions, as if there had never been any Rupture; and the King reſuming the ſame kind Thoughts he had before for his ſaid Royal Highneſs, as he begs it of his Majeſty, his ſaid Royal Highneſs does by this preſent Treaty, entirely renounce and forſake all Engagements entred into, and all Treaties made with the Emperor, Kings and Princes, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended under the Name of the League: And promiſes to uſe all his Endeavours, and do all that lies in his Power, to obtain of the ſaid Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates, at leaſt of the Emperor and the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick King a Neutrality in <hi>Italy,</hi> till the General Peace: Either by a particular Treaty that ſhall be concluded, or in default of the ſaid Treaty by Declarations, which the ſaid Emperor and Catholick King ſhall make to the Pope, and the Republick of <hi>Venice,</hi> and which ſhall immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:52056:97"/>
be followed by the Retreat of the Troops which the Allies have at preſent in <hi>Italy,</hi> as it ſhall be expreſt hereafter. Moreover, as an evident Teſtimony of the real and effectual return of the King's Friendſhip for his Royal Highneſs, His Majeſty is pleaſed to conſent and promiſe, That the Town and Cittadel of <hi>Pignerol,</hi> with the Forts St. <hi>Brigide la Perouſe,</hi> and others belonging to them, ſhall be raſed and demoliſhed (as to the Fortifications only) at the King's Charges; and the ſaid Fortifications being demoliſhed, the whole ſhall be reſigned into the Hands of his Royal Highneſs, as alſo the Lands and Demains compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended under the name of Government of <hi>Pig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerol,</hi> and which belonged to the Houſe of <hi>Savoy,</hi> before the Conceſſion, That <hi>Victor Amedaeus,</hi> firſt Duke of that Name, had made of them to the King <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. Which Town, Cittadel and Fort thus demoliſhed, and Territory to them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing, ſhall likewiſe be reſtored to his Royal Highneſs, to be held by him in Sovereignty, and enjoyed fully and for ever, both by him and his Succeſſors, as a thing to them properly belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and in Conſideration of the ſaid preſent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, his Royal Highneſs engages and promiſes as well for himſelf, as for his Heirs and Suceſſors, and Aſſigns, not to rebuild or reſtore any of the ſaid Fortifications, nor cauſe new ones to be built upon and within the extent of the ſaid Territory, Ground and Rocks, nor in any other place what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever yielded by this preſent Treaty, by which his Royal Highneſs, or the Inhabitants of <hi>Pigne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rol,</hi> ſhall only be allowed to encloſe the ſaid <hi>Pig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerol</hi> with no other encloſure than a bare Wall, without a Terraſs or any Fortifications. With a Proviſo, that except within the ſaid Territory

yielded by the preſent Treaty, his Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhall be at his Liberty to build what Place, Places or Fortifications he ſhall think fit, without incurring His Majeſties ill Will. Furthermore, That His Majeſty ſhall reſtore to his Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, his Countries and Places Conquered, the Caſtles of <hi>Montmeillan, Nice, Ville-Franche, Suza,</hi> and all others without Exception, entire and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demoliſhed, with the ſame quantities of Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition and Proviſions, Canon and Artillery, as they were provided and ſtored with when they fell into the Hands of His Majeſty, without alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or diminiſhing the Buildings, Fortifications, Augmentations and Meliorations made by His Majeſty. And after the Reſtitution of the ſaid Places, his Royal Highneſs ſhall be free to keep up and augment the Fortifications as Things to him belonging, without being moleſted by the King upon that account, or incurring His Majeſties ill Will. Still providing, That the King ſhall carry away out of the Town, Cittadel and Forts of <hi>Pignerol,</hi> all the Artillery, Ammunition, Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Arms, and moveable Effects of what nature ſoever they be. That as to the Revenues of the Town, Dependencies and Territory of <hi>Pignerol,</hi> the King reſtores them to his Royal Highneſs, in the ſame form and manner as His Majeſty enjoys them at preſent, and the Diſpoſals the King may have made of them, ſhall ſubſiſt and remain in the manner provided by the Contract, Gift, Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion or Acquiſition by which they are diſpoſed of. That the ſaid Reſtitution of the Countries and Places of his Royal Highneſs, as alſo the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation of <hi>Pignerol</hi> razed, with its Dependencies, as aforeſaid, ſhall be made in conſequence of the Signing of this preſent Treaty, but not before

After that the Arbitrators and their Deputies who ſhall have taken an Oath, having viewed and examined the Right of the Parties during the ſpace of ſix Months enſuing, ſhall pronounce their Sentence publickly in the place where the Conference is held, according to the Laws and Conſtitutions of
