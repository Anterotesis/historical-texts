            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>THE ensuing <hi>Treatise</hi> is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently recommended to the World by the Name of the <hi>Author,</hi> and needs nothing else to make way for its enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment. I shall only there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore give a short account of these <hi>Remains</hi> of that learned and excellent <hi>Person,</hi> and of the particular design and intention of them.</p>
                  <p>He was pleased by his <hi>Last Will</hi> to commit his <hi>Papers</hi> to my care, and out of his great
<pb facs="tcp:62179:4"/>
friendship, and undeserved good opinion of me, to leave it wholly to my disposal, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any, or what part of them, should be made publick. <hi>This Treatise,</hi> I knew, he always de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed for that purpose; and if God had been pleased to have granted him but a little longer life, he would have published it himself: And therefore though a considerable part of it wanted his last hand, yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could I be so injurious, to deprive the world of it, because it was less perfect than he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend ed it; nor durst I be so bold, to attempt to <hi>finish</hi> a <hi>Piece</hi> designed and carried on
<pb facs="tcp:62179:4"/>
so far by so great a <hi>Master.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The first <hi>twelve Chapters</hi> were written out for the Press, in his life-time. The <hi>Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> hath been gather'd and made up out of his <hi>Papers,</hi> as well as the <hi>Materials</hi> left for that purpose, and the skill of the <hi>Compiler</hi> would allow: So that it cannot be expected, that the <hi>Work</hi> should be of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual strength and beauty in all the parts of it. However, such as it is, I hope it may prove of considerable use and benefit to the World, and not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unworthy of its <hi>Author.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Design</hi> of it is threefold.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> To establish the great
<pb facs="tcp:62179:5"/>
                     <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God,</hi> and a <hi>Future State;</hi> by shewing how firm and solid a Foundation they have in the Nature and Reason of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; A work never more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary than in this degenerate Age, which hath been so mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably over-run with <hi>Scepticisme</hi> and <hi>Infidelity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> To convince men of the <hi>natural</hi> and indispensable obligation of <hi>Moral Duties;</hi> those I mean, which are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by our <hi>Saviour</hi> under the two general <hi>Heads</hi> of <hi>the Love of God</hi> and <hi>of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</hi> For all the great <hi>Duties</hi> of <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Justice</hi> are written
<pb facs="tcp:62179:5"/>
upon our hearts, and every man feels a secret obligation to them in his own Conscience, which checks and restrains him from doing contrary to them, and gives him peace and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in the discharge of his duty, or in case he offend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it fills him with guilt and terrour.</p>
                  <p>And certainly it is a thing of very considerable use, right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to understand the natural obligation of Moral duties, and how necessarily they flow from the consideration of <hi>God</hi> and of <hi>our selves.</hi> For it is a great mistake, to think that the obligation of them doth solely
<pb facs="tcp:62179:6"/>
depend upon the Revelation of Gods VVill made to us in the <hi>Holy Scriptures.</hi> It is plain that Mankind was always un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a <hi>Law,</hi> even before God had made any external and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Revelation; else, how shall God judge the World? how shall they to whom the <hi>Word of God</hi> never came be acquitted or condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the <hi>Great day?</hi> For <hi>where there is no Law,</hi> there can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be <hi>obedience</hi> nor <hi>transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is indeed an unspeakable advantage which we who are <hi>Christians</hi> do enjoy, both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the more clear and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb facs="tcp:62179:6"/>
knowledg of our duty in all the branches of it, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in regard of the powerful motives and assistance which our blessed <hi>Saviour</hi> in his <hi>Gospel</hi> offers to us, to enable and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage us to the discharge of our Duty: But yet it is never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless very useful for us to consider the primary and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral obligation to <hi>piety</hi> and <hi>vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,</hi> which we commonly call the <hi>Law of Nature;</hi> this being every whit as much the <hi>Law of God,</hi> as the <hi>Revelation</hi> of his VVill in his <hi>Word;</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, nothing contained in the <hi>Word of God,</hi> or in any pretended <hi>Revelation</hi> from <hi>Him,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:62179:7"/>
can be interpreted to dissolve the obligation of moral duties plainly required by the Law of Nature. And if this one thing were but well consider'd, it would be an effectual antidote against the pernicious Doctrines of the <hi>Antinomians,</hi> and of all other <hi>Libertine-Enthusiasts</hi> whatsoever: Nothing being more incredible, than that <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation</hi> should contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict the clear &amp; unquestionable Dictates of <hi>Natural Light;</hi> nor any thing more vain, than to fancy that the <hi>Grace of God</hi> does release men from the <hi>Laws of Nature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This the <hi>Author</hi> of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<pb facs="tcp:62179:7"/>
                     <hi>Discourses</hi> was very sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of, and wisely saw of what consequence it was to establish the <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Duties</hi> of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion upon their true and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral foundation; which is so far from being a prejudice to <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation,</hi> that it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares the way for it, and gives it greater advantage and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over the minds of men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To perswade men to the <hi>practice</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> and the <hi>vertues</hi> of a good life, by shewing how natural and direct an influence they have not, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon our <hi>future</hi> blessedness in another VVorld, but even upon the happiness and prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb facs="tcp:62179:8"/>
of this <hi>present</hi> Life. And surely nothing is more likely to prevail with wise and consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate men to become Religious, than to be throughly convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Happiness,</hi> our <hi>Duty</hi> and our <hi>Interest,</hi> are really but one and the same thing considered under several notions.</p>

                     <p>I Intend, by Gods assistance, in this First Book, to treat concerning the Reasonableness and the Credibility of the Principles of <hi>Natural Religion,</hi> in opposition to that Humour of Scepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cism and Infidelity, which hath of late so much abounded in the world, not only amongst sensual men of the vulgar sort, but even amongst those who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to a more than ordinary measure of wit and learning.</p>

In my entrance upon this work, I am sensible of what ill consequence it may be, to lay the stress of a weighty cause upon <hi>weak</hi> or <hi>obscure</hi> Arguments, which instead of <hi>convincing</hi> men, will rather <hi>harden</hi> and <hi>confirm</hi> them in their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors.</p>
                     <p>And therefore I cannot but think my self obliged in the management of this Argument, to use my utmost cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and endeavour, that it be done with so much strength and perspicuity, as may be sufficient to convince any man, who hath but an <hi>ordinary capacity,</hi> and an <hi>honest mind;</hi> which are no other qualifications than what are required to the institution of men, in all kinds of Arts and Sciences whatsoever.</p>
                     <p>In order to this, I judg it expedient to premise something concerning the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>kinds</hi> and <hi>degrees</hi> of <hi>Evidence</hi> and <hi>Assent,</hi> and to lay down some common <hi>principles,</hi> which may serve as a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation to the following Discourse.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>There is such a kind of Connexion betwixt the Terms of some Propositions, and some Deductions are so necessary as must unavoidably enforce our assent.

                     <p n="3">3. I call that <hi>Moral</hi> Certainty, which hath for its object such beings as are <hi>less simple,</hi> and do more depend upon mixed circumstances.

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62179:15"/>
every man whose judgment is free from prejudice will consent unto them. And though there be no natural necessity, that such things must be so, and that they cannot possibly be otherwise, without implying a Contradiction; yet may they be so certain as not to admit of any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable doubt concerning them.</p>
                     <p>Under each of these Heads there are several Propositions which may be styled <hi>Self-evident</hi> and <hi>first Principles.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Self-evident,</hi> because they are of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves so plain, as not to be capable of proof from any thing that is clearer or more known.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First Principles,</hi> because they cannot be proved <hi>à priori;</hi> That which is first can have nothing before it.</p>
                     <p>Only they may receive some kind of <hi>Illustration,</hi> by <hi>Instances,</hi> and <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,</hi> and by such Universal <hi>effects</hi> as do proceed from them; and from the monstrous <hi>Absurdities</hi> that will follow upon the denial of them.</p>
                     <p>Such <hi>deductions</hi> as do necessarily flow from these Principles have the same kind of Certainty, whether <hi>Physical, Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical,</hi> or <hi>Moral,</hi> with the Principles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from which they are deduced.</p>
                     <p>The two first of these, namely, <hi>Physical</hi>
                        <pb n="9" facs="tcp:62179:15"/>
and <hi>Mathematical</hi> Certainty may be styled <hi>Infallible;</hi> and <hi>Moral</hi> Certainty may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be styled <hi>Indubitable.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By <hi>Infallible Certainty,</hi> I do not mean <hi>absolute</hi> infallibility, because that is an <hi>Incommunicable Attribute.</hi> And it were no less than a blasphemous arrogance, for any man to pretend to such a perfect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erring judgment on which the divine power it self could not impose. But I mean a <hi>Conditional infallibility,</hi> that which sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses our faculties to be true, and that we do not neglect the exerting of them. And upon such a supposition there is a necessity that some things must be so as we apprehend them, and that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not possibly be otherwise.</p>
                     <p>By <hi>indubitable Certainty,</hi> I mean that which doth not admit of any reasonable cause of doubting, which is the only cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of which most things are capable; and this may properly be ascribed both to that kind of evidence arising from the <hi>Nature of things,</hi> and likewise to that which doth arise from <hi>Testimony,</hi> or from <hi>Experience.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I am from the nature of the things themselves <hi>Morally</hi> certain, and cannot make any doubt of it, but that a <hi>mind free from passion and prejudice is more sit
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62179:16"/>
to pass a true judgment, than such a one as is byassed by affections and interests.</hi> That <hi>there are such things as Vertue and Vice.</hi> That <hi>Mankind is naturally designed for a sociable life.</hi> That <hi>it is most agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to reason and the common interests of those in society, that they should be true to their Compacts, that they should not hurt an innocent person,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>And as for the evidence from <hi>Testimony</hi> which depends upon the credit and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Witnesses, these may be so qualified as to their <hi>ability</hi> and <hi>fidelity,</hi> that a man must be a fantastical incredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous fool to make any doubt of them. And by this it is that I am sufficiently assured, That there was such a person as Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> That there is such a place as <hi>Spain.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And so for the evidence of <hi>Experience,</hi> I am by that to a great degree assured of the succession of Night and Day, Winter and Summer. And have no such reason to doubt, whether the house wherein now I am, shall this next minute fall upon me, or the earth open and swallow it up, as to be in continual fear of such accidents.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. That kind of Assent which doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise from such evidence as is less plain and

clear, is called <hi>Opinion</hi> and <hi>Probability.</hi> When though the proofs for a thing may preponderate any thing to be said against it, yet they are not so weighty and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous as to exclude all reasonable doubt and fear of the contrary.</p>

                        <p>And this would be much more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, if besides the probability of gaining by these adventures, there were the like probability of their being utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly undone and ruined, if they should neglect or refuse to venture.</p>

                        <p>The reason why men are moved to believe a probability of gain by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturing their stocks into such For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Countries as they have never seen, and of which they have made no trial, is from the Testimony of other Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble persons, who profess to have known those places, and the advantages of traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick thither by their own experience. And this is generally accounted a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient argument to perswade others unto the like trials.</p>
                        <p>The reason which moved men to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture for the first discovery of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Countries, is, because they had fair probabilities to perswade them, that there were such places, which would probably afford very gainful Traffique.</p>
                        <p>And upon the same ground, if any considerable number of men, such whom we esteem the most wise and the most honest, should assure us, that they did firmly believe, (though they did not know it by experience), that there was such an undiscovered Country, to which if men would make any ventures, their gains would be a thousand times more than could be expected by any other

way of Traffique; and that upon this perswasion. they themselves did resolve to venture their estates, and should with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al offer such arguments for the reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness of what they assert, as to any men, whose judgments were unpreju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced, would render it much more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable than the contrary: In this case, he that would act rationally, according to such rules and principles as all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind do observe in the government of their actions, must be perswaded to do the like, unless he would be counted foolish, and one that did affect singula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>

                        <p>Some Propositions necessary to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised for the removing of several prejudices in Debates about Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>BEsides what hath been already sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested concerning the first founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to be laid, in order to a discourse about Natural Religion, I shall in the next place offer to consideration these seven following Propositions, as being very proper to prevent or obviate the Cavils of Sceptical captious men.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Such things as in themselves are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually true and certain, may not yet be capable of the same</hi> kind <hi>or</hi> degree <hi>of Evidence as to us.</hi> As for instance, <hi>That there was such a man as King</hi> Henry <hi>the Eighth, that there are such places as</hi> Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, <hi>or</hi> China. I say these things may in themselves be equally true and certain with those other matters, <hi>That we now see and are awake, That the three Angles in a Triangle are equal to two right ones.</hi> Though for the first of these we have
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62179:22"/>
only the testimony of others, and humane tradition, whereas for the other we have sensitive proof, and Mathematical de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration. And the reason is because all Truths are in themselves equal, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that ordinary Maxim, <hi>Veritas non recipit magis &amp; minus.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore nothing can be more irrational than for a man to doubt of, or deny the truth of any thing, because it cannot be made out, by such kind of proofs of which the nature of such a thing is not capable. A man may as well deny there is any such thing as <hi>Light</hi> or <hi>Colour,</hi> because he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>hear</hi> it; or <hi>sound,</hi> because he cannot <hi>see</hi> it, as to deny the truth of other things because they cannot be made out by sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive or demonstrative proofs. The kinds of Probation for several things being as much disproportioned, as the objects of the several senses are to one another.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Things of several kinds may admit</hi>

                        <hi>may be good in their kind.</hi> The Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher hath long ago told us, that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the divers nature of things, so must the Evidences for them be; and that 'tis an argument of an undisciplined wit not to acknowledge this. He that is rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal and judicious will expect no other

All things are not capable of the same kind of Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Though the Conclusions in <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks,</hi> by reason of the <hi>abstracted</hi> nature of those Sciences, may be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated by the clearest and most unquesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable way of Probation to our reason, yet it is not rational to expect the like proof, in such other matters as are not of the like nature. This he himself applys to <hi>Moral</hi> things, which being not of such <hi>simple abstracted</hi> naturès, but depending upon <hi>mixed</hi> circumstances, are not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore capable of such kind of Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive proofs. 'Tis a saying of <hi>Jamblicus,</hi> That demonstrations are not to be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted <note place="margin">Protrept. in Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bol. 25.</note> in matters concerning God and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine things. Nor is this any greater pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to the certainty of such things, than it is that God is invisible. And thus like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it is, for the same reason, with many
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62179:23"/>
particular conclusions in <hi>Natural Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy.</hi> And as for <hi>matters of Fact,</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Times, Places, Persons, Actions, which depend upon <hi>story</hi> and the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of others, these things are not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of being proved by such scientifical Principles as the others are. Now no so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber man can deny but that several things in <hi>Moral</hi> and in <hi>Natural</hi> Philosophy are in themselves as absolutely and as certainly true, and as firmly believ'd by us, as any <hi>Mathematical</hi> principle or conclusion can be. From whence I infer this, That it is not, ought not to be, any prejudice to the Truth or Certainty of any thing, that it is not to be made out by such kind of proofs, of which the nature of that thing is not capable, provided it be capable of satisfactory proofs of another kind.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>When a thing is capable of good proof in any kind, men ought to rest satisfy'd in</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                        <hi>the best evidence for it, which that kind of things will bear, and beyond which bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter could not be expected, supposing it were true.</hi> They ought not to expect either sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible proof, or demonstration for such matters as are not capable of such proofs, supposing them to be true. Because other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise nothing must be assented to and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, but that which hath the highest
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62179:24"/>
Evidence: All other things being to be looked upon, as uncertain and doubtful, and wholly excluded from all possibility of being known. And at this rate, men must believe nothing at all in story, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause such things cannot be demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and 'tis possible that the rest of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind might have combined together to impose upon them by these relations. And how abhorrent such Sceptical Principles must needs be to common reason, I need not say. Those who will pretend such kind of grounds for their disbelief of any thing, will never be able to perswade others, that the true cause why they do not give their Assent is because they have no <hi>reason</hi> for it, but because they have no mind to it. <hi>Nolle in causa est, non posse praetenditur.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And on the other side, when we have for the proof of any thing, some of the highest kinds of Evidence, in this case it is not the suggestion of a meer possibility, that the thing may be otherwise, that ought to be any sufficient cause of doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
                     <p>To which I shall only add, that we may be unquestionably sure of many things as to their <hi>existence,</hi> and yet we may not be able to explain the nature
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62179:24"/>
of them. No man in his wits can make any doubt, whether there be such things as Motion, and Sensation, and Continuity of Bodies: And yet these things are commonly esteemed inexplicable. So that our not being able to see to the bottom of things, and to give a distinct account of the <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> of them, can be no sufficient cause to doubt of their <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>The mind of man may and must give</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">4.</note> 
                        <hi>a firm assent to some things, without any kind of hesitation or doubt of the contrary, where yet the Evidences for such things are not so infallible, but that there is a pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility, that the things may be otherwise. (i. e.)</hi> There may be an <hi>indubitable</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, where there is not an <hi>infallible</hi> certainty. And that kind of certainty which doth not admit of any doubt, may serve us as well to all intents and purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, as that which is infallible. A man may make no doubt, whether he himself were baptized, whether such persons were his parents, of which yet he can have no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Evidence than Tradition, and the Testimony of others. Who is there so wildly Sceptical as to question, whether the Sun shall rise in the East, and not in the North or West, or whether it shall
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62179:25"/>
rise at all: Because the contrary is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, and doth not imply any Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction? Suppose that in digging of the Earth amongst some ancient ruins, a man should find a round flat piece of Metal, in the exact shape of an old Medal, with the Image and Inscription of one of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours. Or suppose he should dig up a large stone, of the shape of an ancient Tomb-stone, with a distinct In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription upon it, of the name and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of some person said to be buried un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it. Can any rational man doubt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther one of these were not a piece of Coyn, and the other a Grave-stone? or should a man be bound to suspend his as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and belief of this, barely upon this ground, because 'tis possible that these might have been the natural shapes of that particular Metal and Stone, and that those which seem to be letters or figures engraven or embossed upon it, may be nothing else but some casual dents or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities, which by the various motions and temper of the matter did happen to them, amongst those many millions of other figures which they were capable of? Who would not think such a man to be strangely wild, and irrational, who could frame to himself any real scruples
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62179:25"/>
from such Considerations as these? Why, 'tis the same kind of absurd dotage that Scepticks in Religion are guilty of, in suspending their assent meerly upon this ground, because some Arguments for it do not so infallibly conclude, but that there is a possibility things may be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise. He that will raise to himself, and cherish in his mind, any real doubts, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the meer possibility of things, shall not be able to determine himself to the belief or practice of any thing. He must not stay within doors, for fear the house should fall upon him, for that is possible: nor must he go out, lest the next man that meets him should kill him, for that also is possible. And so must it be for his doing or forbearing any other acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Nay I add further, <hi>that</hi> man is sure to be deceived in very many things, who will doubt of every thing, where 'tis pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible he may be deceived.</p>
                     <p>I appeal to the common judgment of Mankind, whether the humane nature be not so framed, as to acquiesce in such a <hi>Moral certainty,</hi> as the nature of things is capable of; and if it were otherwise, whether that Reason which belongs to us, would not prove a burden and a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to us, rather than a priviledg, by
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62179:26"/>
keeping us in a continual suspense, and thereby rendring our conditions perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually restless and unquiet? Would not such men be generally accounted out of their wits, who could please themselves, by entertaining <hi>actual hopes</hi> of any thing, meerly upon account of the possibility of it; or torment themselves with <hi>actual fears,</hi> of all such evils as are possible? Is there any thing imaginable more wild and extravagant amongst those in Bedlam, than this would be? Why, <hi>Doubt</hi> is a kind of <hi>fear,</hi> and is commonly styled <hi>formido oppositi,</hi> and 'tis the same kind of madness for a man to <hi>doubt</hi> of any thing, as to <hi>hope for,</hi> or <hi>fear</hi> it, upon a meer possibility.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>'Tis sufficient that matters of Faith</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">5.</note> 
                        <hi>and Religion be propounded in such a way, as to render them highly credible, so as an honest and teachable man may willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and safely assent to them, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the rules of Prudence be justified in so doing.</hi> Nor is it either <hi>Necessary</hi> or <hi>Convenient,</hi> that they should be establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by such cogent Evidence, as to neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitate assent. Because this would not leave any place for the vertue of <hi>Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,</hi> or the freedom of our obedience; nor any ground for Reward and Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:62179:26"/>
It would not be thank-worthy for a man to believe that which of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty he must believe, and cannot other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise chuse.</p>
                     <p>Rewards and Punishments do proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly belong to <hi>free</hi> Actions, such as are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a mans power, either to do or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear; not to such as are <hi>necessary.</hi> There is no more reason to reward a man for believing that four is more than three, than for being hungry or sleepy; Because these things do not proceed from <hi>choice,</hi> but from <hi>natural necessity.</hi> A man must do so, nor can he do otherwise.</p>
                     <p>I do not say, That the Principles of Religion are meerly <hi>probable,</hi> I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore asserted them to be <hi>Morally certain.</hi> And that to a man who is careful to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve his mind free from prejudice, and to <hi>consider,</hi> they will appear <hi>unquestionable,</hi> and the <hi>deductions</hi> from them <hi>demonstrable:</hi> But now because that which is necessary to beget this certainty in the mind, namely, <hi>impartial Consideration,</hi> is in a mans power, therefore the <hi>belief</hi> or <hi>disbelief</hi> of these things is a proper subject for <hi>Rewards</hi> and <hi>Punishments.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There would be little reason for the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture so much to magnifie the Grace of <hi>Faith,</hi> as being so great a vertue and so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable

to God, if every one were necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated to it, whether he would or no. And therefore God is pleased to propose these matters of belief to us in such a way, as that we might give some Testimony of our teachable dispositions, and of our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence by our assent to them. <hi>Ut sermo Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelii</hi>

And the Scripture doth in several places make use of the word <hi>Faith,</hi> according to this notion of it, as it consists in a readiness of mind to close with and give assent unto things upon such evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence as is in it self sufficient.

certainty. And that man would be generally counted a fool who should do otherwise. Now let it be supposed, that some of the great Principles in Religion, should not seem to some men altogether so evident as to be wholly unquestionable, yet ought their assent still to incline to the greater probability.</p>
                     <p>When it is said to be a duty for men to believe any thing, or to acquiesce in such kind of Evidence as is sufficient for the proof of it: The meaning is not, as if there were any moral obligation upon the <hi>Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,</hi> which is proper only unto the <hi>Will;</hi> but the meaning is, That men should be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to preserve their minds free from any wilful prejudice and partiality, that they should seriously attend to, and consider the Evidence proposed to them, so as to take a just estimate of it. For though it be true, that the judgments of men must by a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural necessity, preponderate on that side where the greatest Evidence lies; suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the mind to be equally disposed, and the ballance to be just; yet must it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al be granted to be a particular virtue and felicity to keep the mind in such an equal frame of judging. There are some men, who have sufficient abilities to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern betwixt the true difference of things;
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:62179:29"/>
but what through their vicious affections and voluntary prejudices, making them unwilling that some things should be true; what through their inadvertency or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect to consider and compare things toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they are not to be convinced by plain Arguments; not through any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficiency in the <hi>evidence,</hi> but by reason of some defect or corruption in the <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty</hi> that should judg of it. Now the neglect of keeping our minds in such an equal frame, the not applying of our thoughts to consider of such matters of moment, as do highly concern a man to be rightly informed in, must needs be a vice. And though none of the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets (that I know of) do reckon this kind of <hi>Faith</hi> (as it may be styled), this teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness and equality of mind in consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and judging of matters of importance, amongst other <hi>intellectual virtues;</hi> yet to me it seems, that it may justly challenge a place amongst them; and that for this reason, because the two extremes of it by way of <hi>Excess</hi> and <hi>Defect,</hi> I mean the assenting unto such things upon insuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Evidence which is called <hi>Credulity,</hi> and the not assenting unto them upon sufficient Evidence, which is called <hi>Incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity</hi> or <hi>unbelief,</hi> are both of them Vices.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:62179:29"/>
Now where the <hi>Excess</hi> and <hi>Defect</hi> do make Vices, or such things as ought not to be, there the <hi>Mediocrity</hi> must denote something that ought to be, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently must be a Virtue, and have in it the obligation of Duty.</p>

                        <hi>supposed to be equal:</hi> (In this case, though an impartial judgment cannot be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to incline to one side rather than to the other, because our <hi>Assent</hi> to things must by a Necessity of Nature, be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned to our <hi>Evidence</hi> for them; And where neither side doth preponderate, the ballance should hang even) <hi>Yet even in this case, men may be obliged to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Actions in favour of that side, which appears to be most safe and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous for their own interest.</hi> Suppose a man travelling upon the Road to meet with two doubtful ways, concerning neither of which he can have any the least probability to induce him to believe that one is more like to be the true way to his journey's end, than the other; only he is upon good grounds assured, that in one of these ways he shall meet with much trouble, difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, danger, which the other is altogether free from: In this case, though a man be
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:62179:30"/>
not bound to believe that one of them is a truer way than the other, yet is he obliged in prudence to take the safest.</p>
                     <p>Nay I add further, If the probabilities on the one hand should somewhat prepon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate the other, yet if there be no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable hazard on that side which hath the least probability, and a very great ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent danger in a mistake about the other: In this case, prudence will oblige a man to do that which may make most for his own safety.</p>
                     <p>These are those preparatory Principles which I thought fit to premise, as a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary foundation for any debate with captious men about these first grounds of Religion. And they are each of them (I think) of such perspicuity, as to need little more than the bare <hi>Proposal</hi> of them, and the <hi>Explication</hi> of their Terms, to evince the truth of them.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>THese things being premised, I betake my self to that which was at first proposed as the chief design of this Book, namely, to prove <hi>the Reasonableness and the Credibility of the Principles of Natural Religion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By <hi>Religion,</hi> I mean that general ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of Reverence towards the Divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whereby we are inabled and inclined to worship and serve God after such a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as we conceive most agreeable to his will, so as to procure his favour and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing.</p>
                     <p>I call that <hi>Natural Religion,</hi> which men might know, and should be obliged unto, by the meer principles of <hi>Reason,</hi> impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by Consideration and Experience, without the help of <hi>Revelation.</hi>

                        <pb n="40" facs="tcp:62179:31"/>
This doth comprehend under it, these three principal things:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. A belief and an acknowledgment of the Divine Nature and Existence.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Due apprehensions of his Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and Perfections.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Suitable Affections and Demeanour towards him.</p>
                     <p>Concerning each of which I shall treat in order.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. There must be a firm belief of the Divine Nature and Existence. <hi>Primus est Deorum culius, Deos credere,</hi> saith <hi>Seneca.</hi> Answerable to that of the Apostle, <hi>He that comes to God, must believe that he is.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 6.</note> Now that this is a point highly credible, and such as every sober rational man, who will not offer violence to his own facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, must submit unto, I shall endeavour to evince by the plainest Reason.</p>
                     <p>In treating concerning this Subject, which both in former and later times hath been so largely discussed by several Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, I shall not pretend to the inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any new arguments, but content my self with the management of some of those old ones, which to me seem most plain and convincing. Namely, from</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Universal consent of Nations, in all places and times.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="41" facs="tcp:62179:31"/>
2. The Original of the World.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That excellent contrivance which there is in all natural things.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The Works of Providence in the Government of the World.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. From the Universal Consent of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in all places and times, which must needs render any thing highly credible to all such as will but allow the human nature to be Rational, and to be naturally endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a Capacity of distinguishing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Truth and Falshood.</p>
                     <p>It is laid down by the <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Aristot.</hi> Top.</note> 
                        <hi>Philosopher</hi> as the proper way of Reasoning from <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> That what seems true to <hi>some</hi> wise men, may upon that account be esteemed <hi>somewhat</hi> probable; what is believed by <hi>most</hi> wise men, hath a <hi>further</hi> degree of probability; what <hi>most men,</hi> both wise and unwise, do assent unto, is yet <hi>more</hi> proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: But what <hi>all men</hi> have generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to, hath for it the highest degree of evidence of this kind, that any thing is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of: And it must be monstrous arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance and folly for any single persons to prefer their own judgments before the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral suffrage of Mankind.</p>
                     <p>It is observed by <hi>AElian,</hi> That the noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <note place="margin">

of God, and of a future state, were more firmely believed, and did usually make deeper impression upon the <hi>illiterate Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,</hi> who were guided by the more simple dictates of Nature, than upon several of the <hi>philosophers,</hi> who by their art and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty were able to invent disguises, and to dispute themselves into doubts and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties concerning such things as might bring disquiet to their minds.</p>
                     <p>That all Nations of men now do, and have formerly owned this Principle, may appear both from present experience, and the History of other Times and Places.

The Works of <hi>Moses</hi> are by general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent acknowledged to be the most ancient Writings in the world. And though the design of them be to prescribe Doctrines and Rules for Religion, yet there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing offered in them by way of proof or perswasion concerning the <hi>Existence of God;</hi> but it is a thing taken for granted, as being universally acknowledged and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved. Nor do we read that any of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ancient Law-givers or founders of Commonwealths, who thought fit to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe Rules for the <hi>Worship</hi> of God, have endeavoured to perswade the people con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his <hi>Being;</hi> which yet had been most necessary, if any doubt or question had then been made of it; as being the very foundation of Religion, and a dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition so requisite to qualifie men for Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Government.</p>
                     <p>And as it hath been thus in former times, so is it now amongst the Nations more lately discovered, and not known to former Ages. 'Tis excellently said by <hi>Tully, Opinionum commenta delet dies,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">De Nat. Deorum, lib. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>Naturae judicia confirmat:</hi> That time wears out the fictions of Opinion, and doth by degrees discover and unmask the fallacy of ungrounded perswasions, but confirms the dictates and sentiments of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;

and 'tis a good sign that those Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are well established which can endure the Test of all Ages.</p>
                     <p>There are two things may be objected against this Argument.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That there is no such Universal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent as is pretended.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. If there were, This would signifie but little, because it may as well be urged for <hi>Polytheism</hi> and <hi>Idolatry.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. That there is no such Universal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent as is pretended, Because there are some Nations in the world so wild and savage, as not to acknowledg any Deity; which by several Historians is reported of the <hi>Cannibals</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> and the Inhabitants of <hi>Soldania</hi> in <hi>Africk,</hi> who are so sottish and grosly ignorant, that they differ very little from Brutes, having scarce any thing amongst them of <hi>Civil Policy,</hi> and nothing at all of <hi>Religion,</hi> or any publick Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies for Worship: Besides such particular persons, pretending to Learning and Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy, as in several Ages have openly as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted, and professedly maintained Athei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Principles, as <hi>Diagoras, Theodorus, Pherecides,</hi> and others are said to have done.</p>

To this it may be said, that supposing these reports to be true, There may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most in all kinds be some few instances, besides and against the general course of things, which yet can no more be urged as prejudices against the common and most usual order belonging to them, than Prodigies may to prove, that there is no Regularity in the Laws of Nature. Is there any Equity or the least colour of Reason in this? For a man to take an Essay of the nature of any <hi>species</hi> of things from such particular instances, as in their kinds are monstrous? Because beasts may sometimes be brought forth with five legs, and it may be two heads, is it reason therefore to conclude, that no other shape is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to their kind? <hi>Specimen naturae cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juslibet, a naturâ optimâ sumendum est,</hi> (saith <hi>Tully)</hi> The Essay of any kind is rather to be taken from the best and most usual, than from the worst and most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved part of it. Will it therefore follow, that Honey is not naturally sweet to our taste, because a sick palate doth not judg it to be so? Such dissolute persons, as are altogether immersed in sensuality, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they have besotted their judgments, cannot be looked upon as the most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent instances of what belongs to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature.</p>

Where there is either a defect of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, or a gross neglect in exciting a mans natural faculties, or improving his reason, by a due consideration of such conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences as do most naturally result from it: In such cases, it cannot otherwise be expected, but that he must come short of that knowledg which he is naturally ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of, and should have, were it not for these defects.</p>
                     <p>Some men are born blind, or have lost their sight, will it hence follow, that there is no such thing in nature as Light or Colour? Others are Lunaticks or Ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots, should any man from hence infer, that there is no such thing as Reason? No man may raise any doubt from such instances as these, but he that will make it a serious Question, Who are the mad men, whether those in <hi>Bedlam,</hi> or those out of it? Whether Ideots are not the wisest of men, and all others the veryest fools, according as they are at the widest distance from them? Can that man be thought to need any further confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or pursuit, who is forced to fly to such a retreat?</p>
                     <p>As for those instances of <hi>particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi> whom stories deliver down to us, as being <hi>professed Atheists,</hi> it may be said.</p>

1. 'Tis plain, that some of these were counted Atheists and Despisers of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, because they did endeavour to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute the fopperies of the Heathen wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and deny the Sun and Moon, and the several Idols that were adored in their Countries, to be true Gods: The loose and vitious <hi>Poets,</hi> having so far debaucht the understandings of the Vulgar, in those darker ages, as to make them believe vile and filthy things of their Gods, unsuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to all Principles of sobriety and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon reason. Upon this, several men, who were more judicious and virtuous than others, thought themselves obliged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim the people from such mischievous fopperies: In order to which, besides the more serious arguments which they made use of, they did likewise by jeers and scoffs endeavour to render these vitious Deities contemptible, and to deride them out of the world. And for this were they by the foolish superstitious multitude counted <hi>Atheists,</hi> which was the case of <hi>Anaxagoras, Socrates,</hi> and others.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Let it be supposed, that some men have declared a disbelief of the Divine nature in general; yet as there have been always some <hi>monsters</hi> amongst men, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of their <hi>Bodies,</hi> so may there be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:62179:35"/>
in respect of their <hi>minds.</hi> And this no prejudice to the standing laws of Nature. And besides it ought to be considered, that the same stories which mention such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons as profest Atheists, do likewise give an account of divers signal judgments, whereby they were witnessed against from Heaven.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. But I add further, There never yet was any such person, who had any full and abiding conviction upon his mind, against the Existence of God. <hi>Mentiuntur qui di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunt se non sentire esse Deum, nam etsi tibi affirment interdin, noctu tamen &amp; sibi du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant.</hi> 
                        <q>They lye who say that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there is no God (saith <hi>Seneca)</hi> though they may profess this somewhat confidently in the day-time, when they are in company, yet in the night and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone they have doubtful thoughts about it.</q> 'Tis their <hi>wish,</hi> but not their <hi>opinion.</hi> The interest of their guilt doth make them desire it. But they are never able with all their endeavours wholly to extinguish their natural notions about it. Witness those continual fears and terrors, whereunto such kind of men are above all others most ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious.</p>
                     <p>The second <hi>Objection</hi> was, That if the consent of Nations be a sufficient evidence
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:62179:36"/>
to prove the <hi>Existence of God,</hi> it may as well prove <hi>Polytheism</hi> and <hi>Idolatry,</hi> for which the like consent may be pleaded.</p>
                     <p>To this two things may be answered:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Though the <hi>Unity</hi> of the Godhead, and the unfitness of worshipping him by <hi>Idols,</hi> be discoverable by the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; yet these things are not so <hi>immediate,</hi> and so obvious to every ones understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the <hi>Being</hi> of God is, but will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire some deeper consideration, and some skill in the rules of reasoning. Now it could not be reasonably expected, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the generality, or any considerable number of the Vulgar, should attain to such a degree of knowledg as their own natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral reason, duly exercised and improved, might have furnished them with. Partly by reason of the <hi>prejudice of Education,</hi> which must needs incline them to acquiesce in what is delivered down to them, as the <hi>belief</hi> or <hi>practice</hi> of their Forefathers; and consequently hinder them from an impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial enquiry into the nature of things: But chiefly for want of <hi>sufficient leisure</hi> to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply themselves to the business of contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, by reason of their being immer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the affairs of the World, either plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, ambition, riches, or else being wholly taken up with cares, about providing the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:62179:36"/>
necessaries of life for themselves and their families; which must needs much divert them, from the serious consideration of things, and hinder them from the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their natural light to all the due consequences of it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The most considering and the <hi>wisest</hi> men in all Ages and Nations, have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly differed from the <hi>Vulgar</hi> in their thoughts about these things, believing but one supreme Deity, the Father of all other subordinate Powers:
<q>
                           <l>—Hominum sator at<expan>
                                 <am>
                                    <g ref="char:abque"/>
                                 </am>

                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whom they called <hi>Jupiter</hi> or <hi>Jove,</hi> with plain reference to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> name <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah.</hi> And to this one God did they ascribe several names, according to those several virtues they suppos'd to be in him, or bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits they expected from him. <hi>Bacchus,</hi> and <hi>Neptune, Nature, Fortune, Fate: Omnia quidem Dei nominasunt, varie utentis suâ potestate,</hi> saith <hi>Seneca.</hi> So likewise <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>De Benefit.</hi> lib. 4. c. 7.</note> 
                        <hi>Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, &amp;c.</hi> And they advise men, to worship this God not so much by <hi>Images,</hi> or by <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> as by inward goodness, by endeavouring to be like him; as I shall shew more largely after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. Now though the opinion of the <hi>Vulgar,</hi> with the consent of the <hi>Wise,</hi> may be of great Authority; yet being separated
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:62179:37"/>
from or especially opposed unto, their opinion, who are best able to judg, it must needs signifie but little.</p>
                     <p>If the question should here be proposed, How comes it to pass, that mankind should thus consent and agree in the notion of a Deity, and to what ground or cause may it be ascribed?</p>
                     <p>To this I shall suggest something by way of answer, both <hi>Negatively,</hi> and <hi>Positively.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Negatively,</hi> from what hath been said it may appear, that this belief doth not proceed from any particular <hi>infirmity,</hi> or <hi>occasional prejudice</hi> in the judgment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it hath been so constant and universal amongst Mankind. And besides, there is not the least probability for those things which are assigned as the grounds of this Prejudice, namely, <hi>Fear, Policy, Stipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. Not <hi>Fear,</hi> or a certain jealousie of the worst that may happen. For though it must be granted natural to the minds of men, to be possessed with an awe towards such things as are able to hurt them; yet 'tis much more probable, that the fear of a supreme Being, is rather the consequence and <hi>Effect</hi> of such a belief, than the <hi>Cause</hi> of it. For this reason, Because the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Deity doth comprehend under
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:62179:37"/>
it infinite <hi>Goodness</hi> and <hi>Mercy,</hi> as well as <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Justice;</hi> and there is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why <hi>Fear</hi> should dispose a man to fancy a Being that is infinitely <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Merciful.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Not <hi>Policy</hi> or the device of Statists, to keep mens Consciences in awe and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige them to subjection. 1. Because the greatest Princes and Politicians themselves, have in all ages been as much under this conviction of a Deity, and the lashes of Conscience, as any other persons whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; which could not be, had they known this business of Religion to have been a device or state engine, whereby their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects were to be imposed upon. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this belief is amongst the more rude and savage Nations, such as in all other regards are ignorant and wild and utterly destitute of all common Policy.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Not <hi>Stipulation</hi> or mutual agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for the same reason; Because 'tis amongst those barbarous and savage peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who decline all kind of commerce with others. Nor is it imaginable, how such kind of persons should agree toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to promote any opinion, who are wildly separated from one another, by Seas, and Mountains, and Desarts; and yet not at so great a distance in their
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:62179:38"/>
Habitations, as in their Customs and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
                     <p>From all which it may appear, That this <hi>Opinion</hi> or <hi>Belief</hi> which is so <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> amongst men, doth not arise from any prejudice or partiality upon their minds; But rather the <hi>doubting</hi> or <hi>questioning</hi> of these things, which <hi>belongs but to few.</hi> There is reason enough to believe, that <hi>this</hi> may be founded in prejudice. Nor is it diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to determine whence their preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice doth arise, namely, from the viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous inclinations of men, which will cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and byass their judgments. When once men are immersed in sensual things, and are become slaves to their Passions and Lusts, then are they most disposed to doubt of the Existence of God. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as on the contrary, the more just and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest any man is, the more willing and careful he is to walk up to the dictates of his natural light, by so much the more firmely are such persons convinced of this Truth. 'Tis the Conscience of Guilt which makes it the Interest of some that there should be no God. And consequently being desirous to have it so, this makes them studious how to find out some doubt and obscurity about it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Affirmatively.</hi> It is a known Rule,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:62179:38"/>
                        <hi>That the Cause must be as universal as the Effect is.</hi> If this belief have been <hi>one</hi> and <hi>constant</hi> in all places and times, then must the cause of it be so likewise. And what is there imaginable that hath a fairer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to this, than the very <hi>nature of our minds,</hi> which are of such a frame as in the ordinary exercise of their faculties, will easily find out the necessity of a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Being. And it seems very congruous to reason, that he who is the great Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the world, should set some such mark of himself upon those Creatures that are capable of worshipping him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they might be led to the Author of their Being, to whom their worship is to be directed; as is observed in a late <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious.</note> wherein there are many other things to this purpose.</p>
                     <p>Such kind of Notions as are <hi>general</hi> to mankind, and not confined to any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Sect, or Nation, or Time, are usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally styled <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:62179:39"/>
yet because Learned men do some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what differ in their apprehensions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the first rise and original of them, I shall therefore take this occasion to sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest briefly, that which to me seems the most easie and natural way for the explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this, namely, by comparing the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward sensation of our minds and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings, with that of our outward senses.</p>
                     <p>It hath been generally agreed upon, and we find it by sufficient experience, that the acts of our minds are reducible to these three kinds.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Perception of such single objects as are proposed to them, which is called <hi>sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Apprehension.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Putting together such single objects, in order to our comparing of the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or disagreement betwixt them, by which we make Propositions, which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Judging.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. The discerning of that connexion or dependence which there is betwixt seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Propositions, whereby we are enabled to infer one Proposition from another, which is called <hi>Ratiocination,</hi> or Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</p>
                     <p>Now as there is an universal agreement in the sensation of outward objects; The
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:62179:39"/>
                        <hi>Eye</hi> and the <hi>Ear</hi> of all sensitive Creatures, having the same kind of perception of <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible</hi> and <hi>audible</hi> things. Those things which appear Green, Blew, or Red to one, having the same appearance to all others. So must it be with the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of men likewise, which do agree in the same kind of Perception or simple Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of intelligible objects.</p>
                     <p>And as in making of Propositions, or compounding our Apprehensions about sensible things, we determine that the Green in this object is like the Green in that other, and unlike the Yellow or Blew in a third; That it is more, or less, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, to something else, with which we compare it: So likewise is it for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding other simple notions belonging to the understanding, By which we judg one thing to be like or unlike, agreeable or disagreeable, equal, or more or less, in respect to something else compared with it.</p>
                     <p>Now those kind of Apprehensions wherein all men do agree, these are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>natural Notions.</hi> And of this kind are all those Opinions which have in them such a suitableness to the minds of men, as to be generally owned and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged for true, by all such as apply their thoughts to the consideration of them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="58" facs="tcp:62179:40"/>
As for such Doctrines as depend meerly upon institution and the instruction of others, men do frequently differ both from themselves, and from one another about them; because that which can plant, can supplant. If meer institution be able to fix such opinions, it may be able to unsettle them again. Whereas no kind of institution will be sufficient to eradicate these natural notions out of the minds of men.</p>
                     <p>But now, though the understanding have naturally this power belonging to it, of <hi>Apprehending,</hi> and <hi>Comparing,</hi> and <hi>Judging</hi> of things; yet is it not to be expected, either from Infants or from dull sottish people, or from such as are desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of all the advantages of Education, that they should improve this natural abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, to all the due consequences of it. But in order to this, 'tis necessary that men should first be out of their Non-age, before they can attain to an actual use of this Principle. And withal, that they should be ready to exert and exercise their faculties to observe and consider the nature of things, to make use of that help which is to be had, by the instruction and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of those with whom they converse. Nor can this be any just exception against
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:62179:40"/>
the naturalness of such notions, that they are promoted by the experience and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of others; Because mankind is naturally designed for a Sociable life, and to be helpful to one another by mutual conversation. And without this advantage of discourse and conversation, whereby they communicate their thoughts and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions to one another, it could not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise be, but that men must needs be strangely ignorant, and have many wild and gross apprehensions of such things as are in themselves very plain and obvious, and do appear so to others.</p>
                     <p>For the better understanding of this, let us suppose a person bred up in some deep Cavern of the Earth, without any instruction from others, concerning the state of things in this upper surface of the World: Suppose this person, after he is arrived to a mature age, to be fetched up from this solitary abode, to behold this habitable World, the Fields, and Towns, and Seas, and Rivers, the various revolutions of Seasons, together with the beautiful Host of Heaven, the Sun, and Moon, and Stars: It could not otherwise be, but that such a Person must at first view have many wild imaginations of things. He might conceive those useful
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:62179:41"/>
and beautiful contrivances of Houses and Towns, to spring up and grow out of the Earth, as well as Trees; or else that Trees were made and built by men, as well as Houses. But supposing him to be a man, he must be endowed with such a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural faculty, as upon further considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and experience will quickly satisfie him, That one of these was <hi>natural,</hi> and the other <hi>artificial;</hi> And that the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were framed to that elegance and convenience by the Art and Skill of men.</p>
                     <p>It would not at first seem credible to him, that a large Tree should proceed from a small Seed or Kernel: That an Egg should produce a Bird. And as for Man himself, he would not be able to have any conception of his true Original; how it could be possible, that a young Infant should be bred in his Mothers womb, where it should continue for so many months inclosed in a bag of water, without breathing; yet upon experience these things would appear to him unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionable, and of <hi>Natural Evidence.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From what hath been said, it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, That such things are evident by <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural light,</hi> which men of a mature age, in the ordinary use of their faculties, with the common help of mutual Society, may
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:62179:41"/>
know and be sufficiently assured of, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the help of any special Revelation. And when it is said that the Notion of God is natural to the soul, the meaning of it is, That there is such a faculty in the soul of man, whereby upon the use of reason he can form within himself a set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led notion of such a first and supreme Being, as is endowed with all possible perfection. Which is all I shall say as to this first Argument. I shall be briefer in the rest.</p>

                     <p>NOthing can be more evident, than that this visible frame which we call the World, was either from all <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> or else that it had a <hi>beginning.</hi> And if it had a beginning, this must be either from <hi>Chance</hi> or from some <hi>wise Agent.</hi> Now if from clear Principles of Reason, it can be rendered more credible, that the world had a beginning, and that from some wise Agent, This may be another Argument to this purpose.</p>
                     <p>I cannot here omit the mention of a late Discourse, wherein this subject hath <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Dr. Tillot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son's</hi> I. Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</note> been so fully treated of, that I shall need to say the less of it, having little that is material to add to what is there deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</p>
                     <p>In the discussing of this, I shall pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely omit the mention of those argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which relate to <hi>Infinity,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not so easily intelligible, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore more apt to <hi>puzzle</hi> and amuse, than
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:62179:42"/>
to <hi>convince.</hi> Let it be supposed, that each of the two Theories, whether about the <hi>Eternity</hi> of the World, or its having a <hi>Beginning,</hi> are not impossible, and that neither of them does imply a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. And further, that neither of them can be infallibly demonstrated by the meer principles of Reason. In this case the question must be, which of them is most credible.</p>
                     <p>He that would rationally fix his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and belief about this matter, hath but these two kind of Proofs to enquire after.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Testimony,</hi> or the Tradition of the most Antient times.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Reason,</hi> or such Probabilities as do arise from the nature of the thing.</p>
                     <p>For the first of these Opinions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Eternity of the World, there is very little to be said from either of these.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. As to <hi>Testimony. Aristotle,</hi> who was a great Patron of this Opinion, and held <note place="margin">
                           <hi>De Coelo</hi> lib. 1. c. 10.</note> that the world was a necessary Emanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from God, as light is from the Sun; doth of himself acknowledg, that the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers before him, were of opinion that the world had a beginning; which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of his, is no small preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to the Autority of his opinion, as
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:62179:43"/>
I shall shew afterwards. And then,</p>
                     <p n="2">2. As to <hi>Reason,</hi> It is a meer precarious <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> having no sufficient argument that I know of, to render it probable.</p>
                     <p>But now for the other Opinion, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the beginning of the World, there are as fair and convincing proofs for it, of several kinds, as the nature of the thing is well capable of.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. From Tradition. If the world were made and had a beginning, it is but rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable to expect, that so memorable a thing as this, should be recorded in some of the most ancient Histories; And that some extraordinary means should be used to perpetuate the memory of it, and to convey it down from one generation to another by Universal Tradition: And if it shall appear, that all the evidence of this kind is for this opinion, This must needs render it highly credible.</p>
                     <p>Now the <hi>History</hi> of <hi>Moses,</hi> hath been generally acknowledged, to be the most ancient Book in the world, and always esteemed of great Autority, even amongst those Heathens who do not believe it to be divinely inspired: And there is no man of learning, but must allow to it (at least) the ordinary credit of other ancient Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories; especially, if he consider what
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:62179:43"/>
ground there is for the Credibility of it, from the Theology of the darker times, which is made up of some imperfect Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and allusions, relating to those par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular stories which are more distinctly set down in the writings of <hi>Moses.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now <hi>Moses</hi> doth give such a plain, brief, unaffected account of the Creation of the world, and of the most remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble passages of the first ages, particularly of the plantation of the world by the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persion of <hi>Noah</hi>'s Family, so agreeable to the most antient Remains of Heathen Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as must needs very much recommend it to the belief of every impartial man.</p>
                     <p>Though the <hi>Jews</hi> were but a small Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and confined to a narrow compass in the world; yet the first rise of Letters and Languages is truly to be ascribed to them. It is attested by several of the best and most Antient Heathen Writers, that the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Alphabet, or (which is all one) the <hi>Phaenician,</hi> is that from which both the <hi>Greek</hi> and the <hi>Latin,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently the generality of the rest now known, are derived, so <hi>Herodotus, Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch, Pliny, Curtius, Lucan, &amp;c.</hi> From whence it may be probably infer'd, that the account given by the first Language, is the most ancient, and therefore the most
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:62179:44"/>
likely to be a true Account of the first Original of things.</p>
                     <p>The usual course observed by all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to preserve the memory of things most remarkable, which might otherwise in tract of time be forgotten, especially amongst such as are not acquainted with Letters, hath been by some <hi>practical Institution,</hi> as by appointing some <hi>Festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val</hi> for the Commemoration of such things. And thus likewise hath it been in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent case; The <hi>Sabbath</hi> (as <hi>Moses</hi> expresly tells us) was instituted for this very pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, to keep up the memory of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And though perhaps it may be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to prove, that this day hath upon this Account been observed by any other Nation, but the <hi>Jews;</hi> yet the division of Time by Weeks, hath been univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally observed in the world, not only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the <hi>Civiliz'd,</hi> but likewise amongst the most <hi>Barbarous</hi> Nations. And there being no foundation in nature for this kind of distribution of days, It must therefore depend upon some antient general Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, the original whereof, together with the particular reason of it, is preserv'd in the most ancient of all other Histories, <hi>viz.</hi> that of <hi>Moses.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for the derivation of this from the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:62179:44"/>
seven Planets, whose names have been an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently assigned to them; this being well considered, will appear to be so far from invalidating what I now assert, that it will rather contribute to the Probability of it.</p>
                     <p>It is commonly believed, that the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation of the names of the Planets to the days of the week, was by the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans,</hi> who were much devoted to Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical devices, and had an opinion that every hour of the day was governed by a particular Planet, reckoning them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their usual order, <hi>Saturn, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter, Mars, Sol, Venus, Mercury, Luna;</hi> That Planet which was ascribed to the first hour, giving name to the whole day; supposing <hi>Saturn</hi> to belong unto the first hour of <hi>Saturday,</hi> then the second hour will belong to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> the third to <hi>Mars,</hi> &amp;c. and according to this order, the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth hour will belong likewise to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,</hi> and so will the twenty-second, the twenty-third to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> the twenty-fourth to <hi>Mars;</hi> and so the first hour of the next day must belong to <hi>Sol,</hi> which must ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly give the denomination to that day; and so for the other days of the week.</p>
                     <p>Now if it may appear, that in this very
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:62179:45"/>
account, which all sorts of Learned men do agree in, there is such a special regard to the <hi>Jewish Sabbath,</hi> or <hi>Seventh-day,</hi> as cannot be pretended for any other, This will still render it more credible, That the Tradition of the Sabbath did precede these Astrological Names. If we suppose these Astrologers to reckon from the first day of the Creation, and to begin with the most noble Planet the <hi>Sun;</hi> Then the Seventh-day will be <hi>Saturday,</hi> or the <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish</hi> Sabbath: Or (which is more proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) if we suppose them to begin their computation, from the first day after the Creation was finished, and from the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Planet, of slowest motion, and so more proper to signifie a day of rest; Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this way of Computation, there is a peculiar priviledg belongs to the <hi>Jewish</hi> Sabbath, which cannot be said of any of the other days.</p>
                     <p>The Testimony of greatest Antiquity next to the Books of <hi>Moses,</hi> must be sought for amongst those Ancient Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the <hi>Egyptians, Chaldeans, Phenicians,</hi> from whom the <hi>Grecians</hi> derived their Learning, and amongst whom the first and most famous Philosophers of <hi>Greece</hi> were wont to travel, for the improving of their knowledg; It being probable that some
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:62179:45"/>
Memorials might be preserved amongst those ancient Nations, concerning the first beginning of things; and that they were acquainted with what was the Universal Tradition of the first Ages. Upon which account, those <hi>Grecian</hi> Philosophers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Aristotle,</hi> such as <hi>Thales, Anaxagoras, Pythagoras,</hi> &amp;c. who by their travel were conversant amongst these Nations, must by this advantage be more competent Judges than he was, concerning the general be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief and opinion of former times, and what grounds they had for it.</p>
                     <p>Now it is well known to have been a general Tradition amongst these Nations, That the World was made, and had a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning. And though there be some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious accounts amongst them, which may seem inconsistent with the Writings of <hi>Moses,</hi> as namely that of the <hi>Chalde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> who reckon Forty-three thousand years from the beginning of the World to the Time of <hi>Alexander:</hi> yet this way of Computation is acknowledged by <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus Siculus</hi> and <hi>Plutarch,</hi> to be meant of <hi>Lunary</hi> years, or Months; which being reduced to <hi>Solary</hi> years, will fall out to be much about the time assigned by <hi>Moses</hi> for the Creation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="70" facs="tcp:62179:46"/>
But besides these Testimonies of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Nations, and the first <hi>Grecian</hi> Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers who conversed amongst them; This hath been likewise believed and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed by the most eminent Writers since, <hi>Socrates,</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> and <hi>Tully,</hi> and <hi>Seneca,</hi> and the generality of the rest, whether <hi>Philosophers</hi> or <hi>Poets,</hi> of greatest repute for their Learning, who have asserted, That God was the Maker of the World.</p>
                     <p>There are several passages to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose amongst those ancient <hi>Greek</hi> Poets, <hi>Linus, Hesiod, Orpheus, Epicharmus, Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stophanes,</hi> which relate to the Creation of the World; and <hi>Ovid</hi> particularly, who fetched his matter from the <hi>Grecian</hi> Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, doth give such a plain description of it, as if he had been acquainted with the Books of <hi>Moses;</hi> in those known <hi>Verses:</hi>
                        <q>
                           <l>Ante mare &amp; terras, &amp; quod tegit om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia coelum, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                           </l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nor hath it been thus only amongst the more civilized Nations; But the Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <hi>Indians</hi> likewise have owned this Tradition, and professed the belief of it. Now it is not easie to imagine, how any such Tradition could arise so <hi>early,</hi> and spread so <hi>universally,</hi> if there were not a real ground for it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="71" facs="tcp:62179:46"/>
As for the Arguments from <hi>Reason,</hi> I would offer these things to consideration:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. If the World had been either with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a beginning, or else very old, much older than the time assigned for it in the History of <hi>Moses;</hi> 'Tis not likely, but there should be some kind of Memorials of those former Ages, or some real Evidence that there had been such. <hi>Quis dubitet, quin</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Saturnal. lib. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>Mundus recens ac novus sit, cum Historia Graeca, bis mille annorum historiam vix contineat?</hi> saith <hi>Macrobius. The World cannot be very old, because the Grecian History doth scarce extend to Two thousand years.</hi> This was that which convinced <hi>Lucretius,</hi> that the World could not be E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, Because there were such obscure footsteps or reliques in any credible story, either amongst the <hi>Grecians</hi> or <hi>Romans,</hi> concerning any Persons that lived, or any considerable Action that was done, much before the <hi>Trojan Wars.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. The first rise and progress of Arts and Sciences in the world, may likewise afford another fair probability to this purpose. <hi>Seneca</hi> asserts, that there was not above a thousand years since the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Arts and Sciences, to the time wherein he lived. There is scarce any one of them so Ancient, but that the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:62179:47"/>
and first Inventors of them are record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Story. Nor is there any Nation in the world, now accounted Civil, but within the memory of Books, were ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly rude and barbarous. Now it is not imaginable, that so sagacious, so busie a Creature as Mankind is, could all of them have lived an infinity of Ages, destitute of those Arts, so advantageous for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and benefit of human life, without some successful attempts for the supplying of their wants by them.</p>
                     <p>If it be said, That it is <hi>possible</hi> there might have hapned many general Inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, by which former Inventions might be lost and forgotten, and such a kind of simplicity introduced into the world, as is proper to the first and ruder Ages of it. To this, I have shewed before, That a meer possibility to the contrary, can by no means hinder a thing from being highly Credible. To which I shall presently add something further.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. If the World had been eternal, How comes it to pass, that it is not every-where inhabited and cultivated? How is it, that very probably a considerable part of it is yet unknown? It is not yet two hundred years since, that one half of that which is now known lay undiscovered. Whereas
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:62179:47"/>
if we judg of its beginning by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Plantations and fulness of it, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to those proportions wherein men and families are now multiplied, allowing for such kind of Devastations, by War, Famine, Pestilence, Inundations, as are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in Credible Story to have hapned in former times; I say according to this, it will appear highly credible, that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the world was much about the time mentioned by <hi>Moses</hi> for the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it; whereas had it been Eternal, it must long ere this have been over-stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and become too narrow for the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, though we should suppose the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition but of one man every year. Nay, though we suppose but the addition of one man for every thousand years, yet long before this time there should have been a far greater number than there could be sands in the earth, though the whole Globe were made up of nothing else.</p>
                     <p>If it be said, That there may have been great checks given to the encrease of mankind by Wars, Famines, Pestilences, and Inundations.</p>
                     <p>To this it may be replied, That either these extraordinary devastations of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, must fall out regularly, so as not to
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:62179:48"/>
be too much or too little; and in this case, they must be ordered by some Wise Agent, which is God; or else they must be purely Casual; And then it is by no means credible, but that the world must long ere this have been wholly wasted, and left desolate of Inhabitants, or else frequently too much replenished.</p>
                     <p>But the most plausible shift against the force of this argument, is fetched from the instance of <hi>Noah</hi>'s Flood, by which the whole world was destroyed, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one Family. The like whereto may frequently have hapned before, when perhaps one only Family did escape, and those such ignorant persons, as could give no true account of what was before.</p>
                     <p>But neither will this shift serve the turn. Because no man can give any ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional account, how 'tis possible that such a general Flood should come, by any <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> means. And if it be <hi>supernatural,</hi> that grants the thing I am proving, namely such a <hi>Supreme Being</hi> as can alter the course of nature? But let it be supposed <hi>natural,</hi> How comes it to pass that so much as one Family doth escape. Such kind of Deluges, as must prevent the over-stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the world, must be necessary once every ten or twenty thousand years. And
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:62179:48"/>
there must have happened many millions of them, from all eternity. And who shall take care for the adjudging of them to their proper season? or for preventing the total destruction of mankind? Though we should grant this possible casualty, yet he who can believe that to be a <hi>probable</hi> casualty which hath never come to pass in an eternal duration, must not pretend to be an enemy to Credulity.</p>
                     <p>By what hath been said it may appear, that there is a very great advantage in the proofs for this opinion, concerning the <hi>beginning of the world,</hi> above the other for the Eternity of it.</p>
                     <p>Now for the <hi>Difficulties</hi> on each side: Those relating to the Eternity of the world, have been already discussed, in the proofs I have lately insisted upon. And as for the Opinion, concerning the Creation of it, the chief difficulty which <hi>Aristotle</hi> doth mention, is from that Principle of his, <hi>Ex nihilo nihil fit,</hi> which is generally acknowledged to be true concerning natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Generations, but must not necessarily be extended to supernatural productions. It is one of the natural notions belonging to the Supreme Being, to conceive of him that he is Omnipotent. And it is very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable for us to believe, that our finite
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:62179:49"/>
understandings cannot comprehend the utmost extent of Omnipotence. And though the making of something out of nothing do argue an inconceivable pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, yet there is no contradiction in it. And if such things must be denyed which our reasons cannot comprehend, we must then deny that any thing can be self-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istent, which yet is and must be supposed, on both sides; It being altogether as diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult for us to conceive, how <hi>any thing should be of it self,</hi> as how <hi>any thing should be made of nothing.</hi> So that this difficulty is not sufficient to overthrow this opinion, and withal it doth extend equally to both sides.</p>
                     <p>So then if it do appear, that betwixt these two <hi>opinions</hi> the least and fewest difficulties do lye, on that side which hath the plainest and strongest proofs, There is no question to be made, which way every impartial man will determine his opinion.</p>
                     <p>I do not pretend that these Arguments are <hi>Demonstrations,</hi> of which the nature of this thing is not capable: But they are such strong probabilities, as ought to prevail with all those, who are not able to produce greater probabilities to the contrary.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="77" facs="tcp:62179:49"/>
As for that other <hi>Opinion,</hi> concerning <hi>Epicurus</hi> his Atoms, It is so extravagant and irrational, and hath been so abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly confuted by others, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think it expedient to spend any time in the discussing of it.</p>

The most accurate engravings or embossments, seem such rude bungling deformed works, as if they had been done with a Mattock or a Trowel. So vast a difference is there betwixt the skill of <hi>Nature,</hi> and the rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and imperfection of <hi>Art.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And for such kind of Bodies, as we are able to judg of by our naked eyes, that excellent contrivance which there is in the several parts of them; their being so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiously
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:62179:51"/>
adapted to their proper uses, may be another argument to this purpose. As particularly those in <hi>humane bodies,</hi> upon consideration of which, <hi>Galen</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, no great friend to Religion, could not but acknowledg a Deity. In his Book <hi>de Formatione Foetus,</hi> he takes notice, that there are in a humane body above 600 se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Muscles,</hi> and there are at least ten several Intentions, or due Qualifications, to be observed in each of these; Proper figure, just magnitude, right disposition of its several ends, upper and lower Positi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the whole, the insertion of its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Nerves, Veins, and Arteries, which are each of them to be duly placed; so that about the <hi>Muscles</hi> alone, no less than 6000 several ends or aims are to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to. The <hi>Bones</hi> are reckoned to be 284; the distinct scopes or intentions in each of these, are above forty, in all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 100000. And thus is it in some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion with all the other parts, the <hi>Skin, Ligaments, Vessels, Glandules, Humors;</hi> But more especially with the several <hi>members</hi> of the Body, which do in regard of the great variety and multitude of those seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral intentions required to them, very much exceed the <hi>Homogeneous</hi> parts. And the failing in any one of these, would cause an
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:62179:52"/>
irregularity in the Body, and in many of them, such as would be very notorious.</p>
                     <p>And thus likewise is it in proportion with all other kinds of Beings; <hi>Minerals, Vegetables:</hi> but especially with such as are <hi>Sensitive; Infects, Fishes, Birds, Beasts;</hi> And in these yet more especially, for those <hi>Organs</hi> and <hi>Faculties</hi> that concern <hi>sensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> But most of all, for that kind of frame which relates to our <hi>understanding power,</hi> whereby we are able to correct the errors of our Senses and Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to call before us things past and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and to behold things that are invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Sense.</p>
                     <p>Now to imagine, that all these things, according to their several kinds, could be brought into this regular frame and order, to which such an infinite number of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions are required, without the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of some wise Agent, must needs be irrational in the highest degree.</p>
                     <p>And then, as for the frame of <hi>Humane nature</hi> it self. If a man doth but consider how he is endowed with such a <hi>Natural Principle,</hi> whereby he is necessarily incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to seek his own well-being and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness: And likewise with one Faculty whereby he is enabled to judg of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of things, as to their fitness or unfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:62179:52"/>
for this end: And another Faculty whereby he is enabled to chuse and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute such things as may promote this end, and to reject and avoid such things as may hinder it. And that nothing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly is his <hi>duty,</hi> but what is really his <hi>interest:</hi> This may be another argument to convince him, that the Author of his Being must be infinitely Wise and Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
                     <p>The wisest man is not able to imagine how things should be better than now they are, supposing them to be contrived by the Wisest Agent; And where we meet with all the Indications and Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of such a thing as the thing is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of, supposing it to be true, It must needs be very irrational to make any doubt of it.</p>
                     <p>Now I appeal unto any considering man, unto what cause all this exactness and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity can be reasonably ascribed, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Blind <hi>Chance,</hi> or to Blind <hi>Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,</hi> or to the conduct of some Wise In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent Being.</p>
                     <p>Though we should suppose both <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and <hi>Motion</hi> to be Eternal, yet is it not in the least credible, that insensible Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter could be the Author of all those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Contrivances which we behold in
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:62179:53"/>
these natural things. If any one shall sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mize, that these Effects may proceed from the <hi>Anima Mundi;</hi> I would ask such a one, Is this <hi>Anima Mundi</hi> an Intelligent Being, or is it void of all perception and reason? If it have no kind of sense or knowledg, Then 'tis altogether needless to assert any such principle, because Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Motion may serve for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose as well. If it be an Intelligent Wise Eternal Being, This is <hi>GOD,</hi> under ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Name.</p>
                     <p>As for <hi>Fate</hi> or <hi>Necessity,</hi> this must needs be as blind and as unfit to produce wise effects, as <hi>Chance</hi> it self.</p>
                     <p>From whence it will follow, That it must be a Wise Being that is the Cause of these Wise Effects.</p>
                     <p>By what hath been said upon this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, it may appear, That these visible things of the world are <hi>sufficient to leave a man without excuse,</hi> As being the <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses</hi>

                     <p n="1">1. For the more <hi>common</hi> effects of it, namely that general success which in the ordinary course of things doth accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny honest and virtuous actions: And the punishment and vengeance that doth one time or other in this world usually befall such as are wicked: Both Virtue and Vice being generally, and for the most part, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently distinguished by Rewards and Punishments in this life.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="86" facs="tcp:62179:54"/>
There are indeed some instances to the contrary, concerning the Miseries of Good men, and the Prosperity of the Wicked; But these have been by several of the wisest <hi>Heathen, Plato, Plutarch, Tully, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca</hi> &amp;c. sufficiently vindicated, by the clearest Principles of Reason, from being any prejudice to the wise Government of Providence.</p>
                     <p>It is not either Necessary or Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, that Happiness and Prosperity in this Life, which is the usual reward of Virtue, should have either such a <hi>Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> or <hi>Mathematical Certainty,</hi> as could not possibly fail. Because,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It would not be consistent with our dependent conditions, that worldly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity should be so infallibly under the power of our own endeavours, as that God himself might not sometimes inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose for our disappointment. If I may have leave to suppose, what I am now proving, namely a Wise and Omnipotent Providence, It must needs appear highly reasonable, that it should be left to his Infinite Wisdom and Power, to make what reserved cases he pleases, from the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary course of things. From whence it will follow, that these unequal dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions can be no sufficient ground for the disbelief of Providence.</p>

                        <pb n="87" facs="tcp:62179:54"/>
2. It would very much prejudice ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther great Principle of Religion, which is of mighty influence for the regulating of mens lives and actions in this world, namely, the Belief and Expectation of a future state of Rewards and Punishments.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. If temporal prosperity did infallibly attend all good actions, This would be a diminution to Virtue it self. Men would do good by a kind of natural necessity, which would abate just so much from the Virtue of their Actions, as it does from the Liberty of them. It is sufficient, that <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Actions</hi> should have <hi>Moral Motives.</hi> And that Virtue doth generally and for the most part, make men prosperous and happy in this world. We know by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that all Mankind do in their most weighty affairs, think it sufficient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon such causes as do commonly and for the most part prove effectual to the ends for which they are designed. So that this very thing which is usually looked upon as the greatest <hi>objection against</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, is really and truly an <hi>argument for it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. For <hi>extraordinary</hi> effects of it. If we give any credit to the universal History of all Ages and Nations, It will by that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,</p>

                        <pb n="88" facs="tcp:62179:55"/>
1. That there have many times happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed such special signal Providences for the <hi>punishing</hi> of obstinate sinners, and for the <hi>deliverance</hi> of such as were Religious, in answer to their Prayers, whereby the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Governour of the World hath so vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly pointed out his will and meaning, and so plainly manifested his power, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry impartial man must be forced to say, <hi>doubtless there is a God that judges in the earth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. That sometimes <hi>Miracles</hi> have been wrought, which could not be effected without the help of some Superior Power; And sometimes there have been plain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies and predictions concerning such future things, as in their various circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances were contingent. Of which the <hi>Annals</hi> of all Ages and Nations, as well Heathens as Christians, do give very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular and large accounts. And though we may safely grant, that some of the stories to this purpose, delivered either from the more <hi>ancient</hi> or <hi>later</hi> times, were fabulous and vain; yet for a man to deny that ever such things happened in the world, but that they were all meer for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geries and designs to cheat Posterity, this were to subvert the Credit of all History; which is so immodest a thing,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:62179:55"/>
as any sober man would be ashamed of.</p>
                     <p>These arguments are more largely dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussed by others, who have writ upon this subject: But there is one particular which to me seems very considerable to this purpose, though but little notice of it be taken by others: And that is, The state of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Nation, who for these 1600 years have been driven out of their own Countrey, having now no particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar place of abode, belonging to them as a Nation; but are scattered and disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed over all the habitable world, hated and despised where-ever they are permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to dwell; very frequently persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, impoverished, banished, murdered in vast multitudes; And notwithstanding all this, they are not yet so mixed and blen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with other Nations, as to be lost a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them; But are still kept up a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct people, There being no instance like this in any story. As if they were intended for a standing memorial and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to the world, of the divine power and vengeance. To me it seems, amongst rational arguments one of the plainest, not only for the proof of a Deity, and a just Providence in pursuing that Nation with such exemplary Vengeance; But likewise for the autority of Scripture,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:62179:56"/>
and the truth of the Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
                     <p>I might here add another argument to the same purpose, from <hi>Natural Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> which is Gods Deputy, and doth <hi>internally</hi> witness for him, as other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures do <hi>externally.</hi> 'Tis plain, that all mankind are in some measure endowed with this; and one may as well assert, that Hope and Fear are not natural to men, as that Conscience is not. To this purpose I might further argue, from those natural notions of our minds concerning <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil,</hi> the bounds of which are fixed in the nature of things, and do not depend either upon <hi>Custom</hi> or <hi>Positive Law.</hi> Those things which have in them a fitness to promote our chief end, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing styled <hi>Good,</hi> and implying in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Definition of them, <hi>Comeliness</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;</hi> Those things which have in them a natural aptitude to hinder our Chief end being styled <hi>Evil,</hi> and implying in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions of them, <hi>Turpitude</hi> and <hi>Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> From whence it will follow, that there must be some Superior Power, who by framing things with such respects to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards one another, may be said to have declared this Law of Nature, and to have taken care to enforce the observance of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:62179:56"/>
it; both these belonging to the nature of a Law. But I may perhaps have occasion to speak more particularly to this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards.</p>
                     <p>These things put together, are so strong an evidence, and so sufficient to convince the existence of a Deity, that <hi>that</hi> man must be very wilful, who doth not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit and acquiesce in it. And for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is it (saith a <hi>Noble Author)</hi> that God <note place="margin">L. 5 Bacon. Essays.</note> never yet wrought any Miracle to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince an <hi>Atheist;</hi> because to a man that is capable of being convinced, his ordinary works are sufficient to this purpose. And I should think it much more easie and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional (saith the same <hi>Author)</hi> to believe all the fables in the <hi>Poets,</hi> the <hi>Legend,</hi> the <hi>Talmud,</hi> and the <hi>Alchoran,</hi> than that this Universal Frame should be without a Creator and Governour.</p>
                     <p>And now it may not be improper to look back, and take a review of what kind of Evidence hath been produced in this matter. As for any <hi>immediate proof</hi> from our <hi>outward senses,</hi> this cannot be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to for the demonstration of such a Being as is supposed to be a pure Spirit and invisible; But for the <hi>mediate</hi> proofs from the effects of a Wise Omnipotent A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, we can look no where about us, But
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:62179:57"/>
every object doth afford evidence of it. There is no conclusion in Philosophy (not immediately apparent to the sense) that is capable of so full and unquestionable an evidence from plain <hi>effects,</hi> as this.</p>
                     <p>As for that kind of <hi>Inward Sensation,</hi> whereby we can discern the impressions of our own minds, They that have any sense of a Law written in their hearts, or any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural notions about Good and Evil, must by these effects be convinced of a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Being. And as for that kind of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence which belongs to our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings, If the Universal consent of mankind be of any autority: If this Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible world, replenished with such admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble variety of Creatures, preserved and governed in such an excellent order, be any evidence of Infinite Power and Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: If besides what we our selves have known by our own experience, any cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit be to be given to Universal History, attesting to many Signal Providences that have happened in the world: Besides the several Miracles and Prophesies, that have been taken notice of in several Ages and Nations. I say if any, or all of these things be of any force, they must needs render the thing I am proving to be credible in the highest degree, and even altogether unquestionable.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="93" facs="tcp:62179:57"/>
In so much, that if a Deity be supposed, It is not imaginable by what other kind of evidence we should be assured of it, than what we are now furnished withall. And it was before laid down as a Principle, <hi>That when a thing is capable of good proof in</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Chap. 3. Prop. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>any kind, men ought to rest satisfied in the best evidence for it which that kind of things will bear, and beyond which better could not be expected supposing it were true.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If any should imagine, that frequent Miracles might be a more powerful means to convince men of this Principle. To this it may be said,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That this is not <hi>fitting:</hi> the proper work of Miracles being for the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of such doctrines as are not knowable by natural light, not for such things of which men may be sufficiently convinced by reason.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. 'Tis not so certain, that this would be <hi>effectual.</hi> Those frequent Miracles in the passage of <hi>Israel</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> The dividing of the Red-sea, The waters out of the Rock, The cloud and pillar of Fire, The Mannah, The Quails, The destruction of <hi>Korah,</hi> &amp;c. did not prevail with the generality of the <hi>Israelites.</hi> Those con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Miracles under the <hi>Mosaical</hi> dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation;
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:62179:58"/>
The waters of Jealousie; The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary plenty of the sixt year; The Urim and Thummim; The special Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Coasts of <hi>Israel</hi> every third year, when all the Males were to go up to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to worship; which custom of theirs must needs be known to their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, who lived round about them: None of all these, did prove effectual for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of obstinate men. Those occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Miracles wrought by our Saviour, though they were so many and so great, as were never before wrought by any one, yet did they not prevail with many of the <hi>Jews.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If it be said, That none of these proofs do so infallibly conclude, but that there doth still remain a <hi>Possibility</hi> that the thing may be otherwise. To this I have shewed before, That there may be an <hi>indubitable</hi> Certainty, where there is not an <hi>infallible</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Prop. 4.</note> Certainty: And that a <hi>meer possibility</hi> to the contrary, is not a sufficient cause of doubting. To which I now add, That if it should be supposed, that a man could not be sure of the Being of God, Yet 'tis most evident that he could not be sure of the contrary: For this plain reason, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause no man can be sure of a <hi>Pure Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> namely, That such a thing is not;
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:62179:58"/>
unless he will either pretend, to have a certain knowledg of all things that are or may be, than which nothing can be more monstrously and ridiculously arrogant; or else, unless he be sure that the being of what he denies doth imply a contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for which there is not the least colour in this case; The true notion of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting in this, <hi>That he is a Being of all pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible perfection.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If it be supposed, that notwithstanding all that hath been said, there may yet be some probabilities to the contrary. To this it may be answered, That unless these probabilities were greater and stronger than those on the other side, no man who acts rationally will incline to them. And if there be any such, why are they not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced? where are they to be found?</p>
                     <p>If men shall yet pretend, That though they cannot answer these Arguments, yet they do really find some doubt in their own minds. I would ask such, Have you seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously and impartially considered, what is alledged in this case? It should be no preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to any Proposition in Philosophy or Mathematicks, that an ignorant man who never applied his thoughts to such things, doth pretend to doubt of it. If you do in some measure understand, and have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered

these arguments, I would then ask, Have you not as much reason for this, as you your selves would think sufficient, for the proof of any thing you were not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to believe? Do you not knowingly and wilfully entertain prejudices against such things? Have you been true to so much light as you have received? Or have you not rather with-held it in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness? If so, 'tis plain that you have dishonest minds, that you measure by an unjust balance, and therefore cannot be competent judges of truth or fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</p>
                     <p>If it be supposed yet further, that the Probabilities on each side should be equal, or that those on the other side should somewhat preponderate; yet if there be no considerable hazard on that side which hath the least probability, and a very great and most apparent danger in a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake about the other: In this case, every rational and prudent man is bound to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his actions in favour of that way which appears to be most safe and advantageous for his own interest; as I have shewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. <note place="margin">Prop. 7.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>So that in such cases, as may seem unto us not altogether free from some kind of doubt, and which we could not so far
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:62179:59"/>
clear up to our selves, as to make them appear wholly unquestionable; I say, in such cases, men that would act prudently, should enquire, Where lies the danger of mistaking?</p>
                     <p>Why, on the one side, All the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience of Believing this (if it be not so), will be, that we are hereby occasioned to tye our selves up to some needless re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straints during this short time of our lives, wherein notwithstanding there is as to the <hi>present,</hi> much peace, quiet, and safety; And as for the <hi>future,</hi> our error shall dye with us, there being none to call us to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for our mistake.</p>
                     <p>But now on the other side, what if there should be a Deity so holy, and just, and powerful, as is supposed? If this should prove to be a real truth (and no man can be sure of the contrary), what vengeance and indignation may such vile Miscreants and Traitors expect, who have made it their business to banish <hi>Him</hi> out of the world, who is the great Creator and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of it, to undermine his Being, to eradicate all notions of Him out of the minds of men; To provoke his Creatures and Vassals to a contempt of Him, a slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his fear and worship, as being but such imaginary <hi>Chimaera's</hi> as are fit only
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:62179:60"/>
to keep fools in awe? Certainly, as this is the highest provocation, that any man can be guilty of, so shall it be punished with the sorest vengeance.</p>
                     <p>There are two things that <hi>Atheistical</hi> men propose to themselves by their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane loose principles, namely, to avoid the imputation of Credulity, and the fears and perplexities of mind, to which Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion makes men obnoxious. But their <hi>principles</hi> are not more <hi>irrational,</hi> than their <hi>design</hi> is <hi>foolish;</hi> for of all mankind these prophane persons are,</p>
                     <p n="1">1.

                     <p>I Proceed to the second thing propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed as a principal part of Natural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, namely, <hi>Due apprehensions of the Divine Excellency and Perfections.</hi> With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which, the meer belief of his Being, will contribute but little to a true state of Religion. A man may have such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy notions of a Deity, that it would in some respects be as good, nay much better, to be without a <hi>God,</hi> than to have such a one, as he may frame. <q>It would be better (saith a great <hi>Author)</hi> to have <note place="margin">Lord <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons</hi> Essays.</note> no opinion of God, than such a one as is unworthy of him; the one is but meer <hi>unbelief,</hi> the other is <hi>contumely.</hi>
                        </q> 'Tis a common saying cited out of <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi>'s book of Superstition, where he professeth it much more desirable to him, that posterity should say, that there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was any such man as <hi>Plutarch,</hi> rather
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:62179:61"/>
than that he was a fierce, unconstant, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful man, one who upon the least omission of any small circumstance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, by men otherways virtuous and worthy, would tear out their hearts, destroy their families and children, blast their fields, spoil their cattel with light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and thunder. This would be such a representation as would make the noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and remembrance of him hateful; And it were better to be forgotten, than to be remembred with infamy. Now there are some opinions which do thus reproach the Deity, and render him under such a notion, that if the <hi>Gyants</hi> had prevailed in their attempt against heaven, that place had not been worse supplied. This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought to be most carefully avoided.</p>
                     <p>Whereas the Divine nature is supposed to be the first and supreme Good, therefore the <hi>Idea</hi> of all absolute perfection must be essential to the notion of him. And though it be very difficult for us to raise our minds to any due apprehensions of this; yet we must endeavour in our thoughts of him, so far as our finite understandings are capable, to remove and separate from him whatever is in any kind evil or unworthy, and to ascribe unto him the utmost degree of all Goodness and Perfection.</p>

Each of these <hi>Attributes</hi> are upon this account of very great consequence to be believed and considered, because they are the <hi>foundations</hi> of those duties of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion which we owe to him. According as a man apprehends God to be, so must his <hi>esteem</hi> be of him, and his <hi>demeanour</hi> towards him.</p>
                     <p>And whereas these great and necessary points, of so much influence to Religion, have been usually treated of by others either too <hi>largely,</hi> by the inserting of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral things less pertinent; or too <hi>obscure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> by offering such proofs concerning them as are less intelligible, or intermix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the discourses about them, with such niceties as are neither very easie to be solved, nor material for men to know: I shall therefore in this place endeavour to avoid both these inconveniences, by treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing concerning each of them with all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable <hi>brevity</hi> and <hi>plainness:</hi> Observing this method.</p>
                     <p>First, I shall endeavour to <hi>explain</hi> and describe, what is meant by each Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute; And then <hi>prove,</hi> that these Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes so explained, must belong to the natural notion of God. Which I shall make out, both by the <hi>consent</hi> of the wisest <hi>Heathen,</hi> expressed by their declared
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:62179:63"/>
opinions, and by their general practice suitable thereunto: And from the <hi>nature of the things themselves;</hi> their <hi>congruity</hi> to the principles of Reason, and the <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities</hi> that will follow upon the denial of them.</p>
                     <p>Those are called <hi>Incommunicable</hi> At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, which are proper to God alone, and not communicated to any Creature.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>first</hi> of these I have proposed to treat of, is his <hi>Absolute Simplicity.</hi> By which I mean his freedom from all kind of composition or mixture, either of Principles or of Parts: And that this doth belong to the natural notion of the Deity, may be evident,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. From <hi>Testimony</hi> of the <hi>Heathen Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers,</hi> who do generally acknowledg him to be the First Cause and the most Simple Being, and do frequently style him <hi>mens pura &amp; sincera segregata ab omni con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretione mortali,</hi> &amp;c. And not only <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> but the very <hi>Heathen</hi> likewise do express this Attribute by the similitude of <hi>Light,</hi> amongst all visible things the most pure and simple.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. From <hi>Natural Reason,</hi> by which it will appear, that God cannot be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of any Principles, because the principles and ingredients which concur
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:62179:63"/>
to the making of any thing, must be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent to that thing. And if the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature were compounded, it would follow that there must be something in nature before him. Which is inconsistent with his being the first Cause.</p>
                     <p>And here I shall take occasion to speak somewhat concerning the <hi>Spirituality</hi> of the Divine nature, as having some affinity with this, though it be none of the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicable</hi> Attributes.</p>
                     <p>I know it hath been said, with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence enough, that the notion of a <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> or <hi>immaterial substance,</hi> doth imply a contradiction; and that there is an ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter impossibility of any other Being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides Matter. But though this hath been <hi>said,</hi> yet was it never <hi>proved,</hi> nor can it be, till either a man be able to evince, that the notion of the word <hi>Substance,</hi> according to the most general use of it, (which gives signification to words), doth necessarily imply <hi>Corporeity,</hi> than which nothing can be more false; or unless a man shall pretend to the certain knowledg and comprehension of all things that are or may be, than which nothing can be more <hi>vain.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>What the <hi>Positive notion</hi> of a <hi>Spirit</hi> is, is not so necessary to enquire after, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine.
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:62179:64"/>

1. By <hi>Testimony.</hi> I have shewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, how that notwithstanding that <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theism</hi> which did so generally abound a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the <hi>Heathen,</hi> yet the wiser and more considerate persons amongst them, have in all ages acknowledged <hi>One Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Deity.</hi> The <hi>Egyptians</hi> of old, though of all others the most infamous for their multiplicity of <hi>Gods,</hi> yet did assert <hi>One</hi> Maker and chief Governour of the world, under whom they did suppose several sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate <hi>Deities,</hi> who as his <hi>Deputies</hi> did preside over several parts of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse.</p>
                     <p>The first occasion of these <hi>lesser Deities,</hi> was probably from a desire that men had, to express their gratitude to, and to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the memories of, such <hi>Heroical Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi> as in those first and ruder ages of the World, had either by their <hi>inventions</hi> or their <hi>prowess,</hi> been highly beneficial to <hi>mankind,</hi> or to their <hi>own Countries;</hi> who thereupon were for such publick ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, thought fit to be advanced to the highest honour after their deaths, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in a subordinate way, to some share of Government, especially in taking care of the welfare of their Countries. And to this doth the <hi>Apostle</hi> seem to allude, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 4, 6. where he saith, <hi>We know
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:62179:66"/>
there is no other God but one, for though there be that are called Gods, both in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and in Earth,</hi> (as there be Gods ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and Lords many): <hi>But to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him.</hi>

                     <p>There are many attestations amongst the <hi>Heathen Writers</hi> concerning this Attribute, the <hi>Unity</hi> of the Godhead.

But he was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards so sensible of this impious folly, that he writes a particular discourse to his son <hi>Musaeus,</hi> and his other friends, wherein he doth solemnly recant these wild absurd Fables, professing to them, that he thought himself obliged to recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie these errors and abuses, which his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>Poem</hi> might have occasioned. And here he doth in the first place admonish them, that there is but one God, of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and none besides him; <gap reason="foreign">

wicked men, with several other things to this purpose. And though <hi>Homer</hi> do too often follow <hi>Orpheus</hi> in these fictions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a multitude of Deities, yet when he is most serious, he supposes but one, <gap reason="foreign">

properly a God.

                     <p>To suppose two Gods, with <hi>several Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,</hi> some belonging to one, and some to another, will plainly prove, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them can be <hi>God,</hi> because neither of them have all possible Perfections.</p>
                     <p>To suppose <hi>two</hi> Gods of the <hi>same</hi> and <hi>equal Perfections,</hi> would likewise prove, that neither of them can be God, <hi>(i. e.),</hi> not absolutely perfect; because it is not so great a priviledg, to have the same equal perfections with another, and in a kind of partnership, as to be alone and superior above all others.</p>

                        <hi>two</hi> things, as being the grand principles of Religion. 1. That God is the cause of all good, and in no wise of any evil. 2. That he is constant and immutable, and cannot deceive by making various representations of himself.</p>
                     <p>So <hi>Seneca,</hi> speaking of the necessity of ascribing this Attribute to the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as to his Purposes or Counsels, hath this passage; <hi>Statuerunt quae non muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt, nec unquam primi consilii Deos pae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitet.</hi>

God is always constant to his own Decrees, and doth never repent of his Purposes. And in another place, <hi>Necesse</hi>

'Tis necessary that he should be always plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with the same things, who can be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with nothing but what is best: Nor can this be any prejudice to his Liberty or his Power, since he is his own Necessity,</hi> i. e. nothing from without, but his own natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural perfection lays this necessity upon him.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. By <hi>reason.</hi> There is an excellent ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to this purpose, in that place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-cited out of <hi>Plato,</hi> which according to his manner, he delivers in a more co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious way of expression. But the substance of it is this; All change must be either <hi>involuntary</hi> and upon necessity, or <hi>volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary</hi> and upon choice. Now God being the most <hi>powerful</hi> Being, cannot by any thing be necessitated to an <hi>involuntary</hi> change. And for any <hi>voluntary</hi> change, whereas it must be either for the <hi>better</hi> or the <hi>worse,</hi> it is not imaginable, that any <hi>wise</hi> Being should be willing to change for the <hi>worse;</hi> Nor is it possible that any <hi>perfect</hi> Being should change for the <hi>better.</hi>
                        <pb n="117" facs="tcp:62179:69"/>
And therefore 'tis necessary that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature should be immutable.</p>
                     <p>We esteem changeableness in men either an imperfection, or a fault. Their <hi>natural</hi> changes, as to their <hi>persons,</hi> are from weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and vanity; their <hi>moral</hi> changes, as to their <hi>inclinations</hi> and <hi>purposes,</hi> are from ignorance or inconstancy. And therefore there is very good reason, why we should remove this from God, as being that which would darken all his other perfections. <hi>The greater the Divine Perfections are, the greater Imperfection would Mutability be.</hi> Besides, that it would take away the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all Religion, <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Fear,</hi> and <hi>Affiance</hi> and <hi>Worship:</hi> In which men would be very much discouraged, if they could not certainly rely upon God, but were in doubt that his nature might alter, and that hereafter he might be quite other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise from what we now apprehend him to be.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Infiniteness</hi> is another Attribute most natural to the Notion of God. By which is meant, his not being bounded by <hi>place,</hi> or <hi>space,</hi> or by <hi>duration,</hi> but being <hi>Immense</hi> and <hi>Eternal.</hi>

spread himself to all places that we can see or can imagine, and infinitely beyond: So as we cannot say, he is here and not there, thus far he reaches and not farther. Some have thought, that it is not absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly necessary to believe such a kind of <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipresence</hi> of the Divine substance, as to be actually present in every place. But this is most necessary to be believed, That God is every-where in respect of his <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Providence,</hi> whereby he doth influence and govern all things, (which is hardly possible to conceive without his actual presence in all places) And in respect of his <hi>Knowledg,</hi> whereby he doth see and take notice of every thing, though never so secret; and that he can pierce through all these created things, with greater fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility than the Light doth through the Air.

                     <p>It is essential to the notion of God, that he should be happy and immortal. The <hi>Poets</hi> themselves, who amongst all others had the wildest thoughts of God, yet do continually give him the Title of <gap reason="foreign">

How is it possible for us to conceive of God, but as being Eternal?</hi> There never yet
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:62179:72"/>
was any man, that had any conception of God, who did not esteem him to be Everlasting.

                     <p n="2">2.

                           <hi>Of the</hi> Communicable <hi>Perfections of God: And first, of those which relate to the</hi> Divine Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>viz.</hi> Knowledg, Wisdom, particular Providence.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>BEsides those <hi>incommunicable</hi> Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes already insisted upon, there are others styled <hi>communicable,</hi> because they are in some lower degree, and by way of participation, communicated to other inferior Beings. And concerning these, there is a necessity that we should make an estimate of them, by such rules and measures as our natures are capable of. And because the chief perfections that we can apprehend in any reasonable Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, must refer to one of these three things, the <hi>Understanding,</hi> the <hi>Will,</hi> the <hi>Faculties</hi> of <hi>working;</hi> for this reason, these Divine perfections may be reduced to these three heads. And whatever is the most excellent of rational Beings, must excel in each of these, <hi>(i. e.),</hi> There is
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:62179:73"/>
no kind or degree of perfection that our imaginations are able to conceive, but these excellencies of the Divine nature, must run out still beyond it, so as not to be determined by any real or imaginary bounds.</p>
                     <p>I purpose to treat particularly concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing each of them, beginning with those perfections that belong to the Divine <hi>Understanding,</hi> namely, his <hi>Knowledg, Wisdom,</hi> and <hi>particular Providence.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. By the <hi>Knowledg</hi> of God, I mean that perfection or faculty whereby he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands and considers things absolutely and as they are in their own natures, their <hi>powers, properties, differences,</hi> together with all the circumstances belonging to them. And 'tis necessary to the notion of God, that this should be ascribed to him, in the utmost perfection of it, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely beyond what the most knowing and the most learned men can pretend unto.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. His <hi>Knowledg</hi> is most deep and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate, reaching to the very <hi>essence</hi> of things, ours but slight and superficial.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. His is clear and distinct, ours but confused and dark.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. His infallible, ours doubtful and liable to mistakes.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. His easie, and without labour and
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:62179:74"/>
difficulty, always present and actual; ours gotten by <hi>sore travail,</hi> and easily lost again by the defects of <hi>memory</hi> or <hi>age.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. His universal, extending to all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; ours short and narrow, reaching on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to some few things, <hi>That which is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Eccl. 1: 15.</note> 
                        <hi>cannot be numbred.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He hath a perfect comprehension of all things, that have been, that are, or shall be, according to all the various relations, dependencies, circumstances, belonging to each of them. So that this Attribute of his must be infinite and unbounded, both <hi>extensivè,</hi> with respect to the several kinds of objects which it comprehends; and likewise <hi>intensivè,</hi> as it sees every single object with a most perfect infallible view. He doth not only understand all particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars; but he knows every particular so exactly, as if he were wholly taken up and intent in his thoughts upon that alone. There is a vast difference betwixt the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest of men, and such as are grosly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and sottish; and much greater be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt men and other creatures, the little Insects, Ants and Worms, which are no ways fit to pass a judgment concerning humane counsels and designs. And yet these things hold some proportion to one another, being both finite; whereas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:62179:74"/>
Gods <hi>knowledg</hi> and mans, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance is infinite.</p>
                     <p>And that this Attribute doth belong to the natural notion of God, may appear,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. From the acknowledgment of the <hi>Heathen. Tully</hi> mentions it as an usual saying of <hi>Thales, Deos omnia cernere,</hi> God beholds all things. So <hi>Seneca, Nihil Deo clausum, interest animis nostris, &amp; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diis cogitationibus intervenit. Nothing is hid from God, he is intimate to our minds, and mingles himself with our very thoughts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Besides, that general practice amongst them of swearing by him, and attesting him in their most solemn compacts, doth sufficiently imply their belief of his <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niscience.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. From <hi>natural reason.</hi> Nothing can be more manifest, than that <hi>knowledg</hi> is a perfection, and therefore ought to be ascribed to that Being which is supposed to have all possible perfection. 'Tis a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection that we know to be in some of the <hi>Creatures,</hi> and therefore must be much more in the <hi>Creator</hi> himself. <hi>He that made the eye, shall be not see? He that gives to men understanding, shall not be know?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Besides, that the denial of this perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, would necessarily infer many other imperfections in the Divine nature. It
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:62179:75"/>
would destroy his <hi>Wisdom, Providence, Dominion.</hi> Where there is no knowledg, there can be no forecast or provision for the future, nor any kind of regular go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. In brief, the denial of this At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute must take away his <hi>Goodness, Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity, Justice.</hi> That Being cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be said to be <hi>good,</hi> which doth act either out of ignorance or blind necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. As <hi>Knowledg</hi> doth respect things ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely; so <hi>Wisdom</hi> doth consider the relations of things one to another, under the notion of <hi>Means</hi> and <hi>End,</hi> and of their fitness or unfitness for the various pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses to which they are designed.</p>
                     <p>And this likewise doth belong to the natural notion of God, may be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. By <hi>Testimony.</hi> The <hi>Heathen Writers</hi> are full of expressions to this purpose. <hi>Plato</hi> asserts <hi>Wisdom</hi> to be a thing of that excellency, that it cannot properly be <note place="margin">Phaed.</note> ascribed to any, but God. It is a saying of <hi>Tully, Sapiens est Homo, &amp; proptereae Deus; Man is wise, and therefore much</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Natur. Deor.</note> 
                        <hi>more God.</hi> And in the same Book, <hi>Deo tribuenda est ratio recta, constansque; To</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Lib. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>God is to be ascribed right and steady
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:62179:75"/>
Reason;</hi> and a little after he says, it must be such as is <hi>perfect</hi> and <hi>absolute.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nothing more frequent in <hi>Seneca, Epicte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, Antoninus,</hi> than to perswade men to an acquiescence under all the dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Providence, because they are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by the highest Wisdom.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. By <hi>Reason.</hi> The want of wisdom is counted a very great imperfection, and one of the worst defects belonging to men; and that which every one is most unwilling to own, being content to be counted any thing rather than a Fool. And therefore there is very good reason, why we should remove this imperfection from that <hi>Being,</hi> which is supposed to have all possible per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. And what was said before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the denial of his <hi>Knowledg,</hi> must be equally true likewise in this case, that it must necessarily destroy his other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, or render them insignificant. What reason would there be for men to trust either to his Goodness, or his Justice, or his Providence in the managing of things, if he were not withall infinitely wise. And as for his <hi>Power, that</hi> without wisdom, would be but a kind of a blind force, as much to be feared and hated, as loved and trusted to.</p>

3. The third <hi>Attribute</hi> to be considered is his <hi>particular Providence,</hi> whereby he does superintend and take care of every individual thing in the world; continuing them in their Beings, disposing of their operations and effects in such a wise or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as may be most suitable to those ends and purposes for which they are designed. This likewise doth belong to the natural notion of God. Though it must be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the belief of this Attribute hath met with some opposition from several of the Philosophers, chiefly <hi>Epicurus,</hi> who in truth was an Atheist, and out of a pretended respect to the Deity, did think it to be below his <hi>Greatness;</hi> and for the trouble of it, inconsistent with his <hi>Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness,</hi> to have any regard to these Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour things, which he therefore imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be left to their own courses, whilst the Divine nature is wholly taken up in the contemplation of it self.</p>

But because this might seem to argue too slight and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row apprehensions of the Deity, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore others to mend the matter, have thought that he might have leisure, and perhaps an inclination, to extend his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence to <hi>heavenly things,</hi> but not to

                        <hi>earthly.</hi> Others yet more bountiful, will allow it to reach both to <hi>Celestial</hi> and <hi>Terrestrial</hi> things: But then it must be only to the <hi>general kinds</hi> of them, which are to be put into a natural course; not to <hi>every particular</hi> of each kind by it self, which they conceived must needs prove too great a trouble and distracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his mind.</p>
                     <p>But 'tis evident that all these wild con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits did proceed from a misapprehension of what kind of knowledg or wisdom does belong to the Deity, namely, <hi>infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite</hi> and <hi>absolutely perfect,</hi> not to be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited, nor capable of any difficulty to be put upon it, by the nature or num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of things.</p>

                     <p>This is the foundation of all Worship and Religion amongst men, the reason of their Prayers to God, and Praises of him.

impose upon them; and by his <hi>Power</hi> he could tyrannize over them, and play with their misery; but that he will not do thus, we are assured by his <hi>Goodness.</hi> This is so essential to him, that to imagine him without <hi>Goodness,</hi> were to imagine a God without a Deity, <hi>i. e.</hi> without that which chiefly constitutes him what he is: Nay, it were to imagine instead of a God, a worse Devil, and more qualify'd to do mischief, than any is now in the world.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The second Attribute belonging to the Divine Will, is his <hi>Justice.</hi> By which is meant not only the rectitude of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in general, but more specially <hi>his dealing with his creatures according to the desert of their deeds.</hi>

From <hi>Reason.</hi> It is one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est reproaches, and an argument of base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness amongst men, to be counted a Lyar: And therefore must it necessarily be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from that Being which is suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to have all possible perfections, and to be the <hi>Father of Truth,</hi> as the Devil is of Lyes.</p>
                     <p>That which tempts men to falsifie, is usually either the fear of some evil, or the hope of some advantage. The reason why they break their words, is either because of their rashness and inconsiderateness in
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:62179:82"/>
making promises, or their forgetfulness in not minding them, or their inconstancy in not keeping to them, or their impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to perform them. But now the Divine nature being infinitely wise and allsufficient, can have no temptation to be otherwise than true and faithful. His infinite <hi>Knowledg</hi> and <hi>Wisdom</hi> doth secure him, from <hi>being deceived</hi> himself; his <hi>Omnipotence</hi> doth exempt him, from standing in need of <hi>deceiving others;</hi> and his <hi>Goodness</hi> secures us, from the lest sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition of any inclination thereto.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Of the</hi> Perfections <hi>belonging to the</hi> Powers <hi>and</hi> Faculties of Acting, <hi>viz.</hi> Power, Dominion, Distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of future Rewards and Punishments.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THose Perfections which are essential to the Notion of God, with respect to his <hi>faculties of working,</hi> are likewise three fold:
<list>
                           <item>1. His Power or Omnipotence.</item>
                           <item>2. His Dominion or right to govern us in this life.</item>
                           <item>3. His Distributing of future Rewards and Punishments after this life.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. By the <hi>Power</hi> or Omnipotence of God is meant, an <hi>ability of doing all such things, the doing of which may argue Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi> and which do not imply a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, either <hi>in the things themselves,</hi> or to the nature and perfection of the <hi>Doer.</hi> Some things are repugnant to the perfection of God, either <hi>Naturally,</hi> as
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:62179:83"/>
that he should be sick or dye; or else <hi>Morally,</hi> as that he should lye or deceive: Both which imply <hi>imperfection.</hi> And some other things may imply <hi>Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> either directly, or by plain conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. And of such matters it is not so proper to say, that <hi>he cannot do them,</hi> as that <hi>they cannot be done.</hi> As the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the Understanding, the Eye, and the Ear, is that which is intelligible, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, audible: So the object of Power, must be that which is Possible. And as it is no prejudice to the most perfect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, or sight, or hearing, that it doth not understand what is not <hi>intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible,</hi> or see what is not <hi>visible,</hi> or hear what is not <hi>audible;</hi> so neither is it to the most perfect <hi>Power,</hi> that it doth not do what is not <hi>possible.</hi> Every kind of faculty being necessarily determined to its own proper object.</p>
                     <p>But as for all Possible things, it is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and necessary to apprehend of God, that he can do whatsoever any other single thing, or a combination of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things put together, can perform, and infinitely more; and that without any kind of labour or difficulty: So that his Power must be infinite <hi>extensively,</hi> with respect to all objects; and <hi>inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively,</hi>
                        <pb n="145" facs="tcp:62179:83"/>
with respect to the acts of it, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the <hi>manner</hi> and <hi>degrees</hi> of them.</p>
                     <p>That this kind of Omnipotence doth belong to the natural notion of God, may appear,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. By <hi>Testimony.</hi> It is a frequent title given unto God by the <hi>Grecian</hi> Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers, who style him <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent.</p>
                     <p>And nothing is more frequent amongst the <hi>Latines,</hi> than the titles of <hi>Jupiter Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotens, Optimus-Maximus:</hi> He is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally acknowledged to be the Creator and Governour of the World, upon which account they call him, <hi>Opifex rerum,</hi> and <hi>Rector mundi.</hi> It is an acknowledgment of <hi>Tully, Nihil est quod Deus efficere non</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">De Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat.</note> 
                        <hi>possit, &amp; quidem sine ullo labore.</hi> 
                        <q>There is nothing which God cannot do, and that without any kind of labour.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. By <hi>Reason.</hi> If the power of God could be limited or circumscribed, it must either be by something of greater power, which is inconsistent with the notion of his being supreme and soveraign: Or else by the difficulty and repugnancy which there is in the nature of things; which could not be in the first creation of them, because there was nothing then to make
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:62179:84"/>
any resistance, and since that, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what was made by him, deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from him, and is dependant upon him, and therefore must be subject to him. And besides, all such things being finite, must therefore be at a vast distance of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality from the <hi>infinite</hi> power of God.</p>
                     <p>To which may be added, that all his other perfections would be insignificant and ineffectual, if his power of acting, whereby they were to be communicated to inferior natures, were not answerable to them. Meer <hi>Knowledg</hi> without <hi>Power</hi> would be but an idle speculation; <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> to contrive, without <hi>Power</hi> to effect, would be but vain and useless. What could his <hi>goodness</hi> and <hi>mercy</hi> signifie to us, if he were not able to give any proofs of it. And so likewise for his <hi>Justice</hi> and <hi>Faithfulness,</hi> which there would be no reason to fear or to depend upon, if Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and Punishments were not at his disposal, and he had not sufficient power to perform what he promises. Nor could there be any sufficient ground for his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing acknowledged the supreme Lawgiver. For why should any one take upon him to intermeddle in the affairs of the world, and to prescribe Laws to others, who had no power to dispose of things, and were
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:62179:84"/>
not able to enforce obedience to his own Laws?</p>
                     <p>In brief, without the belief of this At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute, there can be no foundation for Religion, amongst men; because there could be no ground for our <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Trust,</hi> no reason for our <hi>Hope</hi> or <hi>Fear.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Besides this <hi>absolute</hi> consideration of the Divine <hi>Power,</hi> there is likewise a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative</hi> notion of it, respecting that <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> and Jurisdiction which he hath over reasonable Creatures, his right to govern them in this life; to command, prohibit what he pleases, to reward and punish as shall seem good unto him. And that this doth belong to the natural notion of God, may appear,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. By <hi>Testimony. Plato,</hi> and <hi>Tully,</hi> and <hi>Plutarch,</hi> do often style him, the <hi>Lord of</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Symposiac.</hi> lib. 8. Q. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>all things,</hi> the <hi>Eternal God, Father and Creator of the world, and all things in it. Deo nihil praestantius, ab eo igitur necesse est mundum regi,</hi> saith <hi>Tully,</hi> 
                        <q>God is the <note place="margin">Nat. Deor.</note> most excellent Being, and therefore is it necessary that he should be the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the world.</q> And in another place, <hi>Deorum immortalium numine, om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia regi gubernarique credimus.</hi> 
                        <q>We believe that God is the Governour of all things.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="148" facs="tcp:62179:85"/>
To which I shall add that testimony of a Heathen King, <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> in that <note place="margin">Dan. 4. 34, 35.</note> Remonstrance which he published <hi>to all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth,</hi> viz. <hi>that Gods dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is from generation to generation, and all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing before him. And he doth accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his will, in the armies of heaven, and amongst the inhabitants of the earth, and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, what dost thou?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And as this was their declared opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, so was their practice suitable to it; by owning that to be their Duty which they supposed to be agreeable to his Will, and which would render them acceptable to him.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. By <hi>Reason.</hi> If we consider those se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>titles</hi> which can give right to Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion amongst men, we shall find them all to concur in God. Now men claim a right of Government, either by Conquest, or Purchase, or Compact, or by having others born in a state of subjection under them, or by their having oblig'd others with any special bounty or favour; but above all these, there is another ground of subjection, which men cannot pretend
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:62179:85"/>
to, namely, the <hi>giving of Being</hi> to a thing. And this must needs, above all other claims, be the greatest imaginable right, for the government and disposal of that thing, according to the pleasure of him that made it. <hi>It is he that made us,</hi> (says the <hi>Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist)</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Psal. 100. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>and not we our selves;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>we are his people,</hi> and 'tis reasonable that we should be under his dominion and government.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The distribution of future Rewards and Punishments to men, according as their lives and actions have been in this world.</p>
                     <p>That this likewise doth belong to the natural notion of God, may appear,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. By <hi>Testimony.</hi> From all kind of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Writers. Nothing hath been more universally believed in all places and times, not only amongst the civilized Nations, the <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Romans;</hi> but likewise amongst such as were most wild and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous.</p>
                     <p>All sorts and Professions of men, of any special eminence, as Princes, Statesmen, Souldiers, Philosophers, Poets, Artists, have had great impressions upon their minds concerning a future state. And it may be reasonably presumed (as <hi>Tully</hi> observes), <note place="margin">Tuscu. Q. lib. 1,</note> that those who do so much excel others in
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:62179:86"/>
their parts and their virtue, are not gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally mistaken in their judgments about a natural truth.</p>
                     <p>Whereas several other opinions and Doctrines, which at some times have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, have afterwards been rejected; <hi>this</hi> hath still kept up in its vigor and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, amidst all the various revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Government and Religion, of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Churches.</p>
                     <p>The most ancient Philosophers amongst the <hi>Grecians,</hi> who reduced that people to civility, were <hi>Thales, Pherecides, Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras;</hi> the last of whom was for a long time of so great authority, that no others were counted learned but such as were his followers. And each of these have most expresly asserted this Doctrine. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides there are many other testimonies to this purpose, cited out of <hi>Plato, Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docles, Plutarch,</hi> together with <hi>Homer, Euripides, Sophocles,</hi> for the <hi>Grecians;</hi> the ancient <hi>Druids</hi> amongst the <hi>Gauls;</hi> the <hi>Brachmans</hi> amongst the <hi>Indians,</hi> who are all mention'd as bearing witness to this truth, by <hi>Justin Martyr, Clemens Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drinus,</hi> and others.</p>
                     <p>And as for the <hi>Latines,</hi> I shall mention only two testimonies; That of <hi>Tully, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manere</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Tuse.</hi> lib. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>animos arbitramur, consensu natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:62179:86"/>
omnium.</hi> 
                        <q>We do believe that the Souls of men do abide after death, by the consent of all Nations.</q> And that of <hi>Seneca, Cum de animarum aeternitate</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Epist.</hi> 117.</note> 
                        <hi>disserimus, non leve momentum apud nos babet, consensus omnium, aut timentium inferos, aut colentium.</hi> 
                        <q>When we dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute about the immortality of the Soul, the general consent of men, either fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or worshipping the infernal powers, is of no small moment with us.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>That common practice amongst the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, of worshipping their departed <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes,</hi> doth suppose a general belief that their Souls did remain after death, and were advanced unto a higher state of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness and power.</p>
                     <p>In brief, all the attestations amongst them, concerning the <hi>Souls immortality,</hi> are founded in their belief of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of this principle, That there must be a future state of Rewards and Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                     <p>Though it must be granted, that this state as to the manner of it, is by them described in such a Poetical way, as is more fit to <hi>amuse</hi> and make impression upon the <hi>vulgar,</hi> than to <hi>satisfie</hi> the reason of the <hi>judicious.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They tell us, that good men shall after
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:62179:87"/>
their death be received into the <hi>Elysian Fields</hi> and gardens, which are always flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing and pleasant, where men shall be continually exercised in such kind of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments as are most suitable to their inclinations; Some in Combats, Running, Wrestling; Others in Philosophical Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses; others in Dancing or Musick; where such kinds of Actions or Things, whether in themselves worthy, or meerly innocent, in which good men during the time of their lives, did find any special pleasure, should be enjoyed by them in the utmost perfection.</p>
                     <p>And as this shall be the state of such as have been <hi>Virtuous,</hi> so those who have been <hi>Wicked</hi> shall be thrust down into the infernal Regions, into Prisons and dark Caverns, where <hi>Furies</hi> are appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for their tormentors, who shall inflict upon them various kinds of punishments, according to the nature and quality of the Crimes of which they have been guilty.</p>
                     <p>And though such kind of enjoyments wherein these <hi>Heathen</hi> placed their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture happiness, be not altogether so sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual as the <hi>Turkish Paradise,</hi> yet are they too earthly and gross for any rational man to rest in as his chief felicity. And
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:62179:87"/>
must, even to the judgment of meer rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, seem altogether despicable in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison to the <hi>Christians Heaven;</hi> which consists in the raising of our natures to the highest perfection of which they are capable, in a perpetual vision and fruition of the Supreme Good.</p>
                     <p>It must be granted, that the principal evidence for this Doctrine concerning a future state of Rewards and Punishments, is to be derived from <hi>Scripture,</hi> especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally from the New Testament, where 'tis said <hi>that life and immortality is brought</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">2 Tim. 1. 10.</note> 
                        <hi>to light by the Gospel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Not but that there is evidence for it, both from the Old Testament, and from the light of Nature. 'Tis true indeed, that Temporal things are more expresly insisted upon in the promises and threats of the Old Testament, upon account of the grosness and dulness of the people of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who being more immersed in sensible things, were therefore more easie to be wrought upon by such considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But that these things were not then intended for the chief motives of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, may appear from the Histories con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning such Religious persons as lived in those first ages. Amongst whom, there were but very few (if any) that did at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:62179:88"/>
to any such perfect felicity in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of worldly things, but that they might very well apply to themselves the words of old <hi>Jacob,</hi> and say with him, <hi>Few and evil have the days of my life been.</hi> And if God had intended these temporal enjoyments, for the chief felicity which that Religion was to entitle them unto; those very histories upon record, where these promises are mentioned, concerning the sufferings of the best men in those times, must needs have been a disparagement and confutation to these promises themselves.</p>
                     <p>But besides the testimonies to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose from Scripture and revelation, it is not imaginable that in a point of so great moment, and so universal consequence as this is, God should have <hi>left himself without a witness unto all the Nations of the world;</hi> but that all men should be endowed with such natural capacities and notions, as being improved by conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, will afford sufficient evidence for the belief of this great and fundamental Principle.</p>
                     <p>As for such men who live under the sense of guilt, whose interest it is that there should be no future account; It cannot be otherwise expected from such, but that they should be willing to disbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:62179:88"/>
this. And from hence it is, that some of the ancient Philosophers have employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their learning and subtilty, to dispute themselves into some kind of doubt and uncertainty about it. And yet the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality even of these, have been forced to acknowledg it much more probable than the contrary. And as for the vulgar sort of people, who are guided by the more simple dictates of nature, these have in all Ages and Nations submitted themselves to this doctrine, and professed a firm belief of it. And though vulgar opinion be but a very bad Topick, about such matters as may gratifie men in their ease and sensual appetites; yet in such other opinions as are cross to their worldly interests, it may argue such things to be from some natural impression upon their minds, which they must believe, and cannot otherwise chuse.</p>
                     <p>The Arguments I would make use of to this purpose, may be reduced to these three general heads:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The suitableness of this Principle, to the most natural Notions of our minds.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The necessity of it to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of mens lives and actions in this world.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <pb n="156" facs="tcp:62179:89"/>
3. The necessity of it for the vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Divine Providence.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. I begin with the first, The suitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of it to the most natural Notions of our minds, and those kind of impressions which belong to us, as we are reasonable Creatures. We see by experience, that all other things (so far as we are able to judg) <hi>Minerals, Plants, Beasts,</hi> &amp;c. are naturally endowed with such principles as are most fit to promote the perfection of their natures, in their several kinds. And therefore it is by no means credible, that Mankind only, the most excellent of all other Creatures in this visible world, for the service of whom so many other things seem to be designed, should have such kind of principles interwoven in his very nature, as do contain in them meer cheats and delusions. And therefore whatsoever those things are, which the generality of mankind, especially the most wise and the most considerate part of them, do agree in, ought to be allowed for highly credible; otherwise it must follow, that we are framed with such kind of Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as in our most cautious exercise of them, are more likely to seduce us and expose us to error, than to direct and lead us to the truth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="157" facs="tcp:62179:89"/>
But I shall endeavour to manifest this more particularly, by these three consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. This principle is most suitable to the general apprehensions of mankind, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the nature of good and evil.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. To those natural hopes and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which the generality of good men have, concerning a state of future hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. To those natural fears and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which the generality of wicked men are possessed with, concerning a future state of punishment and misery.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. This Principle is most suitable to the general apprehensions of Mankind, concerning the nature of good and evil. All men heretofore have agreed, that there is such a thing as the Law of Nature, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by things are distinguished into good and bad; according to which, the actions of men are determined to be either virtuous or vicious. And as the one of these doth in the essence of it imply comeliness and reward, so doth the other denote turpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and punishment; these things being implied in the very definitions of virtue and vice. And from hence it will follow, That as there is some superiour power who hath put this Law into our natures, so will
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:62179:90"/>
he take care to enforce the observance of it, by rewarding and punishing men ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. This being implied in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Law.</p>
                     <p>If there be nothing in the naked essence of things that makes them to differ, but what doth meerly arise from Custom and positive Laws; why then Custom and Law would be able to render it a very virtuous and commendable thing, for a man to be ingrateful, a breaker of compacts, a false witness, a perjured person; which is so monstrous a position, that the common reason of mankind will abhor it, upon the first proposal. Nothing is more obvious, than that there is an universal desire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst men, of seeming honest: The most impudent and profligate wretch being loth to be esteemed what really he is. The very sin of hypocrisie, so general amongst men, doth give a large testimony to the beauty of goodness, and the deformity of vice. Nor is there any account to be given, why there should be impressed upon the nature of men such a value for the one, and dislike for the other, if there were not in the things themselves, something suitable to those contrary affections.</p>
                     <p>We see by experience, that there is such a kind of rest and acquiescence in the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:62179:90"/>
mind, upon the discovery of truth, and the doing of virtuous actions, as belongs to natural bodies when they are in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per places; which may argue these things to have some peculiar suitableness to the soul of man, and that the opposites to them do offer violence to some natural principle belonging to it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. This principle is most suitable to those natural hopes and expectations, which the generality of good men have concerning a state of future happiness. From whence doth arise that confidence and courage, whereby those of meanest quality and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities (if otherwise virtuous persons) can support themselves in their sufferings for that which is good; which doth necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily suppos<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> in them a strong and even a natural belief and perswasion of such a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture state, wherein their sufferings shall be considered and rewarded.</p>
                     <p>Besides that, there is a strong aversion amongst men, against a dark state of anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilation, which no man can think of with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great regret of mind: And likewise a natural desire in all men after a state of happiness and perfection. And no natural desire is in vain. All other things have somewhat to satisfie their natural appetites. And if we consider the utter impossibility
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:62179:91"/>
of attaining to any such condition in this life, this will render it highly credible, that there must be another state wherein this happiness is attainable; otherwise man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind must fail of his chief end, being by a natural principle most strongly inclined to such a state of happiness as he can never attain to; as if he were purposely framed to be tormented betwixt these two passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Desire and Despair; an earnest pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pension after happiness, and an utter inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of ever enjoying it; as if nature it self, whereby all other things are disposed to their perfection, did serve only in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to make them miserable. And which is yet more considerable, the better and the wiser any man is, the more earnest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires and hopes hath he after such a state of happiness. And if there be no such thing, not only Nature, but Virtue like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise must contribute to make men mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; than which, nothing can seem more unreasonable, to those who believe a just and a wise providence.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. This principle is most suitable to those fears and expectations which the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of wicked men are possessed with, concerning a future state of misery. Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness those natural suggestions of conscience in the worst of men, that upon any wicked
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:62179:91"/>
actions (though never so private) are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes startling of them, with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions of another Judicature and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal, before which they shall be called to an account for the closest sins. All that secret regret, and those inward smitings, <hi>Laniatus &amp; Ictus,</hi> which are so often felt in the minds of men, upon the commission of any great sin, do argue some common intimations, even in the light of Nature, of another Judgment after this life, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they shall be accountable for such acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as men do not punish or take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of.</p>
                     <p>And these natural fears do usually seize upon all kind of men promiscuously: Even those who are most potent, who by their own Will can give Laws to Nations, and command mighty Armies; yet cannot they avoid these checks and lashes of conscience, but that they will seize upon them, and shake them as well as the poorest meanest Subject. Nor can such as are most obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately wicked, who with their utmost stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and endeavour, apply themselves to the suppressing and disbelief of these no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, so wholly stifle them, but that they will be continually rising up in their minds and pursuing of them.</p>
                     <p>Now as there is no man whatsoever, that
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:62179:92"/>
is wholly freed from these fears, of future misery after death; so there is no Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture below Man, that hath any fears of this kind. And if there be no real ground for this, then must it follow, That he who framed all his other Works with such an excellent congruity, did yet so contrive the nature of Man, the most noble amongst them, as to prove a needless torment and burden to it self.</p>
                     <p>If it be said, That these notions may proceed from such principles as men have derived from Institution and the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of others, but that they do not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a necessity of any such natural im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions.</p>
                     <p>To this it may be answered, That it is sufficient to denominate them Natural no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, if they have such a suitableness to the minds of men, as makes them to be generally owned by all those who apply their thoughts to the consideration of them: And that they have such a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral suitableness, may appear, because In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution cannot so easily eradicate these notions, as it can fix them. Now if the meer teaching of others were it self suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to impress these notions, without any such peculiar congruity in the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, it would be as sufficient to deface
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:62179:92"/>
them again: Especially considering the advantage on this side, from that natural repugnancy which we have to any thing which brings disquiet to our minds. And nothing is more troublesome in this kind, than the fear which follows upon guilt.</p>
                     <p>But now, though there have been se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral men of no mean abilities, in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Ages, who have made it their busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to root out of the minds of men all such troublesome notions about a future state, endeavouring to perswade themselves and others, That as there was a time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were born into the world, when they were not; so at their dying or going out of it, they shall exist no more. And yet, though it be their interest to believe this, though they make it their study and business to perswade themselves and others of it; it may reasonably be doubted, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ever yet there hath been so much as one person, that hath hereby become ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely free from these fears: But for the most part, those who would have them esteemed vain and imaginary, without any foundation in nature, these are the persons who are most assaulted with them.
<q>
                           <l>Hi sunt qui trepidant, &amp; ad omnia fulgura pallent.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="164" facs="tcp:62179:93"/>
So powerful and unconquerable are these impressions, and therefore Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The second Reason I proposed to speak to, was from the necessity of this Principle, to the right government of mens lives and actions in this world, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving of society amongst them.</p>
                     <p>Nothing can be more evident, than that humane Nature is so framed, as not to be regulated and kept within due bounds, without Laws; and Laws must be insig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant, without the sanction of Rewards and Punishments, whereby men may be induced to the observance of them: Now the temporal Rewards and Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this life, cannot be sufficient to this end; and therefore there is a necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that there should be another future state of happiness and misery.</p>
                     <p>All the Rewards and Punishments of this life are to be expected, either from the Civil Magistrate, who by virtue of his Place and Calling is obliged to the duty of distributive Justice: Or else from Divine Providence, according to that most usual course which we find by experience to be observed by him, in his dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of these temporal things. Now neither
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:62179:93"/>
of these can afford sufficient motives, for the government of mens lives and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Not all that may be expected from the Civil Magistrates, because there may be many good and evil actions which they cannot take notice of; and they can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and punish only such things, as come under their cognizance. And if this were the only restraint upon men, it could be no hinderance from any such mischiefs or villanies which men had the opportunity of committing secretly. Nor would it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to those, who had power and strength enough to defend themselves from the Law, and escape the penalty of it, but that such might without any kind of check or fear follow the inclinations of their own appetites: Nor would it afford any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy in the case of such wicked Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates as should invert the order of their institution, proving terrors to well-doers, and encouragers to those that do ill.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Not all that may be expected from common Providence: For though it should be granted, that according to the most usual and general course of things, both virtuous and vicious actions are reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and punished in this life; yet there may be many particular cases, which this
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:62179:94"/>
motive would not reach unto; namely, all such cases where a mans Reason shall inform him, that there is far greater probability of safety and advantage by committing a sin, than can be reasonably expected (according to his experience of the usual course of things in the world) by doing his duty. Suppose the case of the <hi>three Children,</hi> or of any other call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Martyrdom, who may be threatned with torments and death, unless they will blaspheme God and renounce their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; if it appear to them very probable (suppose a hundred to one), that upon their refusal, their persecutors will really execute what they threaten: And if on the other side, it prove very improbable (suppose ten thousand to one) that they shall be delivered by a Miracle: In such cases, it is not to be expected, that the consideration of the ordinary course of Providence in the dispensation of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and Punishments, should be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to restrain a man from any kind of Blasphemy or Villany whatsoever.</p>
                     <p>But the thing I am speaking to, will more fully appear, by consideration of those horrid mischiefs of all kinds, that would most naturally follow from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial of this Doctrine.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="167" facs="tcp:62179:94"/>
If there be no such thing to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as happiness or misery hereafter, why then the only business that men are to take care of, is their present well-being in this World. There being nothing to be count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed either good or bad, but in order to these: Those things which we conceive to be conducible to it, being the only duties; and all other things that are cross to it, being the only sins. And therefore whatever a man's appetite shall incline him to, he ought not to deny himself in it (be the thing what it will) so he can have it, or do it, without probable danger.</p>
                     <p>Suppose it be matter of <hi>gain</hi> or <hi>prosit</hi> he is disposed to; if he can cheat or steal securely, this will be so far from being a fault, that it is plainly his duty, that is, reasonable for him to do. Because it is a proper means to promote his chief end.</p>
                     <p>And so for other cases of <hi>anger, hatred, revenge, &amp;c.</hi> According to this principle a man must take the first opportunity of satisfying these passions, by doing any kind of mischief to the person he is offended with; whether by false accusation and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, or (if need be) by poysoning or stabbing of him; provided he can do these things so, as to escape the suspition of others, and humane penalties.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="168" facs="tcp:62179:95"/>
Now let any man judg, what <hi>Bears,</hi> and <hi>Wolves,</hi> and <hi>Devils,</hi> men would prove to one another, if every thing should be not only lawful, but a duty, whereby they might gratifie their impetuous lusts; if they might either perjure themselves, or steal, or murder, as often as they could do it safely, and get any advantage by it.</p>
                     <p>But these things are so very obvious and undeniable, that the most prophane Atheistical persons do own the truth of them. And upon this they are willing to acknowledg, That Religion and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of another life, is a very politick in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, and needful for the well-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the world, and for the keeping of men in awe, from the doing any secret mischiefs. Which (by the way) is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of no small advantage to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Religion, considering that it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the greatest professed enemies to it. Whereby they grant, that it is fit these things should be true, if they are not; or at least, that it is fit that the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of men should believe them to be true. And though themselves pretend to believe otherwise, yet are they not so far out of their wits, as to be willing that those with whom they converse, their
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:62179:95"/>
Wives, and Children, and Servants, should be of the same opinion with them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause then they could have no reason to expect any safety amongst them. What security could any man have of his Estate, or Honour, or Life, if such with whom he is most familiar and intimate, might think themselves at liberty to do all the secret mischiefs to them which they had the opportunity to commit?</p>
                     <p>But there is one thing more, which those who profess to disbelieve this principle, should do well to consider; and that is this, That there is no imaginable reason, why (amongst those that know them) they should pretend to any kind of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty or conscience, because they are whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly destitute of all such motives as may be sufficient to oblige them to any thing of this nature: But according to them, that which is called Virtue and Religion must be one of the most silly and useless things in the world.</p>
                     <p>As for the principle of <hi>Honour,</hi> which some imagine may supply the room of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</hi> This relates only to <hi>external</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, and the esteem which we have amongst others; and therefore can be of no influence, to restrain men from doing any <hi>secret</hi> mischief.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="170" facs="tcp:62179:96"/>
From what hath been said it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, That those who have any regard to their own safety, ought to abandon all kind of society with such pernicious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, who according to their own prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, must take all opportunities of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any mischief to others, which they are able to effect with any advantage to themselves.</p>
                     <p>Now if this be so (as I have proved), that the nature of man is so framed, as not to be effectually perswaded and wrought upon, without the consideration of such a future state; if it be necessary, to add everlasting motives, as the Sanctions of that Law, by which the Humane Nature is to be governed; this must render it highly credible, that there is such a state, because it must needs be very unworthy of God, to conceive of him, that he hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived the nature of one of his best and most noble Creatures after such a manner, as to make it incapable of being governed without falshood and deceit. The neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of this principle to the government of mens lives and actions, is the ground of that saying amongst the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> That Paradise and Hell are two of the seven Pillars upon which God is said to have founded the World. As if it
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:62179:96"/>
could not be upheld without such a sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The third and last Argument, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to speak to, was from the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this principle to the vindication of Divine Providence. Nothing is more uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally acknowledged, than that God is Good and Just; That well-doing shall be rewarded, and evil actions punished by him. And yet we see, that his dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in this life are many times promis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous and uncertain, so that a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not judg <hi>of love or hatred, by all that is before him.</hi> The worst of men are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the best condition, <hi>If in this life only we had hope, we should be of all men</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 19.</note> 
                        <hi>most miserable,</hi> saith the <hi>Apostle,</hi> speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing concerning those primitive times of persecution, when the better any man was, the more was he exposed to suffering. Nor is it thus only in the case of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular persons, or in the success of private differences betwixt men and men; but likewise for some of those decisions that are made by the Sword, in the publick contests of Princes and Nations; these may sometimes be so stated, as to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of them, as may in the judgment of wise and good men seem unequal, and
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:62179:97"/>
not according to justice and the right of the cause.</p>
                     <p>Now the greater uncertainty there is as to the present affairs of this world, by so much greater is the certainty of a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Judgment. It is true indeed, that virtue may be said to be a reward to it self, and vice a punishment; in regard of that satisfaction, or that regret of mind which doth accompany such things. But these are not such kind of rewards and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments, as Lawgivers are to take care of; by which they are to excite those under the government, to overcome the labours and difficulties that they may sometimes meet with in doing their duty, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain others from wicked actions.</p>
                     <p>It would seem a wild extravagant Law, which should propose by way of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, that those who had upon account of Religion or Virtue, undergone any great dangers and troubles, should for their reward be put again to undergo more and greater. That they who had been guilty of Robbery, should by way of punishment be obliged to commit Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
                     <p>Besides those Moral advantages or mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs, which are properly the effects of Virtue and Vice; there is likewise some
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:62179:97"/>
Physical Good or Evil, that may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected as the reward and punishment of them.</p>
                     <p>Would it become a just Governour, to permit his rebellious Subjects, those who contemn his Laws, to persecute such as were obedient to him, with all kind of scorn and violence, stripes, impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment, torments, and death it self; and that for this very reason, because they were willing to do their duties, and to observe the Laws? Would it be a reasonable excuse for such a Ruler to say, That one of these had received suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, punishment in the very commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of such crimes; and that the other had a sufficient reward, both in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his duty, and in his suffering for it? What could be more inconsistent with the rules of Justice, and the wise ends of Government?</p>
                     <p>What could be a greater disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Divine Providence, than to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the calamities and sufferings which good men undergo in this world, many times upon the account of Religion, to pass unrewarded; and the many mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs and prophanations, which wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men take the advantage of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting by their greatness and prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:62179:98"/>
in this world, to go unpunished?</p>
                     <p>What great glory would it be, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side over this material World, Stars and Meteors, Sea and Land, Plants and Beasts, to put these things into such a regular course as may be suitable to their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and the operations for which they are designed; and in the mean space to have no proportionable regard, either for those that reverence the Deity, or those who contemn him?</p>
                     <p>'Tis very well said to this purpose by a late <hi>Author,</hi> That not to conduct the course <note place="margin">Amyral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus.</note> of Nature in a due manner, might speak some defect of Wisdom in God; but not to compensate Virtue and Vice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the defect of Wisdom in not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justing things suitably to their qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but crosly coupling Prosperity with Vice, and Misery with Virtue, would ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue too great a defect of Goodness and of Justice. And perhaps it would not be less expedient (saith he) with <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curus,</hi> to deny all Providence, than to ascribe to it such defects: It being less unworthy of the Divine Nature, to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the Universe altogether, than to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister humane affairs with so much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice and irregularity.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="175" facs="tcp:62179:98"/>
And therefore 'tis necessary for the vindication of Divine Providence, that there should be a future state, and Day of Accounts, wherein every man shall be forced to acknowledg, that <hi>verily there is a reward for the righteous, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less</hi>

A belief and an acknowledgment of the Divine Nature and Existence. 2. Due apprehensions of his Excellencies and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. I proceed now to the third, namely, Suitable affections and demeanour towards him. Which must naturally fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low from the former. The serious belief and consideration of those incomparable Excellencies which there are in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, ought not to be terminated in meer speculation, but must derive an influence upon the heart and affections; it being natural for men to proportion their esteem of things, according to that worth and dignity which they apprehend
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:62179:99"/>
to be in them. And therefore that Being which hath in it all possible Perfections, may justly challenge all possible esteem and veneration, as due to it.</p>
                     <p>In the enumerating of those several af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and duties, I shall observe the same method which I have formerly used in reckoning up the Attributes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Gods incommunicable Excellencies should dispose our minds to <hi>Adoration</hi> and <hi>Worship.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. The communicable Attributes, which belong to the Divine</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Understanding,</hi> namely, his infinite Knowledg and Wisdom, and his particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Providence, should work in us, <hi>Faith, Affiance, Hope, Confidence.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Will,</hi> namely, his <hi>Goodness, Justice, Faithfulness,</hi> are naturally apt to excite in us, <hi>Love, Desire, Zeal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Eaculties of Acting,</hi> namely, his <hi>Power,</hi> which should produce in us <hi>Reverence</hi> and <hi>Fear:</hi> His <hi>Dominion</hi> over us, and distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting of future Rewards and Punishments, which calls for our <hi>Obedience,</hi> both <hi>Active</hi> and <hi>Passive.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Though I cannot say, that each of these Affections and Duties are so to be restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:62179:100"/>
to those respective Attributes unto which I have ascribed them, but that the consideration of any of the rest, may have a proper influence to dispose men to any, or to all of them; yet that there is some more peculiar reference and correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence betwixt these Attributes and these Affections and Duties, as they are here conjoined, I shall endeavour to shew in treating concerning each of them.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Those incommunicable and superla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Excellencies of the Divine Nature, whereby God doth infinitely transcend all other Beings, are naturally apt to work in us, a high esteem and admiration of him; a readiness of mind, upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, to express our <hi>Adoration</hi> and <hi>Worship</hi> towards him.</p>
                     <p>That <hi>Worship</hi> is due to God, hath been universally acknowledged, in all Ages and Nations. And <hi>Aristotle</hi> asserts, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever <note place="margin">Topic. 1. 9.</note> doth doubt of, or deny this, ought not to be dealt with by Arguments, but by Punishments.</p>
                     <p>That it is the Excellency of any Being which is the proper ground of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship we pay to it, hath been generally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged. The <hi>Philosophers</hi> have own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this. So <hi>Tully, Praestans Deorum natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Nat. Deor.</hi> lib. 1.</note>
                        <pb n="179" facs="tcp:62179:100"/>
&amp;c. <q>The nature of God may justly challenge the worship of men, because of its superlative Excellency, Blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Eternity. For whatsoever excels, hath upon that account a veneration due to it.</q> So <hi>Seneca, Deus colitur propter Majestatem eximiam, singularem<expan>

                     </p>
                     <p>By <hi>Worship,</hi> I mean in the general, the highest esteem and admiration of him in our minds, whereby we do continually bow down our souls before him, in the acknowledgment of his Excellencies; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon him, invoking of him in
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:62179:101"/>
our necessities, making our acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to him, as being the Author of all the mercies we enjoy; together with such external services, as may be fit to testifie unto others that inward veneration which we have for him, whether by the humblest gestures, of prostration or bowing our selves before him, kneeling, lifting up our hands and eyes unto him; being always ready to <hi>speak good of his Name, to make his praise glorious.</hi> Which must be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with a hearty zeal and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, against all such things as reflect dishonour upon him.</p>
                     <p>Besides this general habit of <hi>Worship,</hi> with which our minds should always be possessed, there are likewise some parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular actions and services, which by the light of Nature, and the consent of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have been judged proper to express our honouring of him: As the setting apart of particular <hi>Persons,</hi> and <hi>Places,</hi> and <hi>Times,</hi> peculiarly for his Worship.</p>
                     <p>It hath been the general practise of all Nations, to have amongst them a distinct calling of men, set apart to officiate <hi>in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cris,</hi> to assist the people in their publick Worship, to instruct them in their duties, and to excite them to the performance of them. Which being a work of so pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:62179:101"/>
usefulness and general necessity, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon reason will assure us, that the best way of providing for it, is by such persons as are bred up to it, and set apart for it. Such men are like to have the greatest <hi>skill,</hi> who have made it their business and their greatest <hi>care,</hi> and who are obliged to it by way of Office.</p>
                     <p>It is natural for men who are joined together in <hi>Civil Societies,</hi> to join like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in <hi>Religious Worship.</hi> And in order to this, 'tis necessary that there should be publick Places, and solemn Times set apart for such Assemblies. Which hath accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly been the practice of all civilized Nations. And in the manner of perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their publick Worship, it was still required to be done with all imaginable submission and reverence. This the <hi>Stoick</hi> commends, and cites <hi>Aristotle</hi> for it; <hi>Egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giè</hi>

We should enter the Temples, with an humble and composed demeanour. When we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to sacrifice, it should be with all imaginable expressions of reverence and modesty, in our countenance and carriage.</q>
                        <pb n="182" facs="tcp:62179:102"/>
As for the chief matter and substance of natural Worship, unto which the light of Reason will direct, I know no other, than invoking of the Deity, returning thanks to him, and inquiring after his Will. Those things which are superadded to these, in that most acceptable way of Worship re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in the Gospel, are not proper to be discoursed of here, because they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend meerly upon revelation.</p>
                     <p>It is true indeed, that all Nations pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to any Religion, from the most an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient times to which any record doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, have agreed in the way of worship by <hi>Sacrifice.</hi> And from this <hi>general practise,</hi> there may seem to be some ground to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, this way of worship to have been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by the <hi>light of Nature.</hi> But when 'tis well considered, what little ground there is to perswade a man, left to his own free reason, that God should be pleased with the killing and burning of Beasts, or with the destroying of such things by Fire of which better use might be made, if they were disposed of some other way; I say, when it is well considered, what little reason there is to induce such a man to believe, that the killing or burning of Beasts or Birds, or any other thing useful to mankind, should of it self be a proper
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:62179:102"/>
and natural means to testifie our subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to God, or to be used by way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation from sin; It will rather appear pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that the original of this practice was from <hi>Institution,</hi> and that our first Parents were by particular revelation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed in this way of worship, from whom it was delivered down to their successive Generations by verbal Tradition; and by this means was continued in those Families, who departed from the Church, and proved Heathen in the first Ages of the world; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst whom this Tradition was in course of time, for want of care and frequent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newals, corrupted with many humane su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perinducements, according to the <hi>genius</hi> or interests of several times, or Nations.</p>
                     <p>As for the Reasons, why God was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to institute to his own people this way of worship, there are these two things may be suggested.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Sacrifices had a typical reference un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that great design which was to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished in the <hi>fulness of time,</hi> by the Sacrifice of Christ upon the Cross, which is at large explained and applied in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral parts of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> from whence many strong arguments may now
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:62179:103"/>
be deduced, for confirmation of the truth of the Gospel.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Because this way of worship was most suitable to those Ages; the Providence of God having purposely adapted his own institutions of worship, unto the abilities and capacities of men in several times. Discovering himself to his people in <hi>divers</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 1. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>manners,</hi> according to <hi>sundry times.</hi> And therefore in those first and ruder Ages of the world, when people were more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally immersed in sensible things, and stood in need of somewhat to raise and fix their imaginations, God was pleased to amuse them with external pomp and solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and to employ that time of their <hi>nonage,</hi> about these plainer <hi>rudiments</hi> or <hi>elements of the world.</hi> But when they <note place="margin">Gal. 4. 3.</note> were grown up from this <hi>nonage,</hi> when the generality of men became more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, better able to consider and abstract things; when by the spreading of the <hi>Roman</hi> Conquests, which extended to the most considerable parts of the world, they had likewise spread their Arts and Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, reducing the Provinces which came under their power, from that savageness and barbarism with which they had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly been overspread, to the love and
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:62179:103"/>
desire of all peaceful Arts, and the study of all useful knowledg, whereby the minds of men were rendered more rational and inquisitive than before they had been, and consequently better prepared for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the Christian Religion: In this <hi>fulness of time</hi> (as the Scripture styles it) did the Providence of God think fit to introduce Christian Religion, a more ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional and spiritual way of worship, whose <hi>Precepts</hi> are most agreeable to the purest and sublimest reason; consisting chiefly in a regulation of the mind and spirit, and such kind of practices as may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the good of humane society, and most effectually conduce to the perfecting of our natures, and the rendering of them happy.</p>
                     <p>And that the most rational kind of worship doth consist in such kind of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications and services, besides the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation of several Scriptures to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, may likewise be made evident by the acknowledgment of the wisest Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens. <hi>Eusebius</hi> quotes <hi>Menander</hi> a <hi>Greek</hi>

                     </argument>
                     <p>I Proceed to those other affections whereby we are to give unto God (so far as Creatures are capable) that honour which is due to those communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable perfections belonging to the Divine <hi>Understanding, Will, Faculties of Acting,</hi> namely, his <hi>Wisdom, Goodness, Power, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion,</hi> and superiority over us, and his <hi>distribution of future Rewards and Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;</hi> which should respectively excite in us, <hi>Affiance, Love, Reverence,</hi> and <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi> both <hi>active</hi> and <hi>passive.</hi> And though each of these graces, have sufficient foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation in every one of the Divine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies promiscuously, yet there is some more peculiar reference and correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence amongst them, according to this order.</p>
                     <p>I purpose to speak to each of them, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally and briefly.</p>
                     <p>First, Concerning <hi>Affiance;</hi> by which I mean an acquiescence of the mind, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is supported against all unnecessary
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:62179:106"/>
doubts and fears, upon account of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine All-sufficiency in general, with more special respect to his Knowledg and Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Providence, whereby he doth take notice of our conditions, and is able to order all things for the best, and doth not permit any thing to befall us without his knowledg of it, and being concerned for it. This Grace, according to its different relations, is usually distinguished into these three branches: 1. As it respects an act of the judgment in assenting to all divine truths, whether discoverable by Reason or by Revelation, so 'tis styled <hi>Faith.</hi> 2. As it imports a resting of the will and affections in the Divine goodness, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther discovered to us by the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or by revelation, so 'tis styled <hi>Trust;</hi> and according to the greater measure or degree of it, <hi>Confidence</hi> and <hi>Plerophory.</hi> So the Heathen, who have no revelation, can support themselves in their sufferings for that which is good, with the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration that God will take care of them. 3. As it relates to the expectation and desire after some future <hi>good</hi> which we stand in need of, or the escaping of some <hi>evil</hi> we are obnoxious unto, so 'tis styled <hi>Hope.</hi> But I shall treat of these promiscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, because they agree in the general
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:62179:106"/>
nature of Affiance. And how reasonable and proper this <hi>affiance</hi> in God is, will appear from these considerations.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. 'Tis necessary to our present state in this world, that there should be something for us, to lean upon, and have recourse unto, as our support and refuge.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. God alone is an all-sufficient stay, upon which the mind of man can secure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repose it self in every condition.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. 'Tis necessary to our present state in this world, that there should be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for us to lean upon, and have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course unto, as our support and refuge. This the ancient <hi>Poets</hi> have signified in their fable of <hi>Pandora</hi>'s Box, which when <hi>Epimetheus</hi> had opened, and saw all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of evils flying out of it, he sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly closed it again, and so kept in <hi>Hope</hi> at the bottom of it, as being the only reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy left to mankind, against all those evils to which they are obnoxious. Every man at his best estate, is but a feeble infirm creature; what from the impotence of his mind, and the disorder of his passions from <hi>within;</hi> together with the troubles and difficulties that he shall meet withall from <hi>without;</hi> the great obscurity which there is in the nature of things, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty which attends the issues and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:62179:107"/>
of them; the mutability of all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane affairs, which cannot possibly be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by all the imaginable wisdom and foresight which men are capable of. From all which it sufficiently appears, that <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>hope</hi> and <hi>trust</hi> are altogether necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the state of men in this world; and that they must always be in an unsafe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet condition, unless they have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to support and relieve them in their exigences. 'Tis observed of the <hi>Hopp,</hi> and other such climbing Plants, which are not of strength enough to bear up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, that they will by natural instinct lean towards and clasp about any thing that is next, which may help to bear them up; and in the want of a Tree or a Pole, which is their proper support, they will wind about a Thistle or a Nettle, or any other Weed, though in the issue it will help to choak and destroy the growth of them, instead of furthering it. The appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is easie, <hi>All flesh is grass, and the</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Isa. 40. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>glory thereof, as the flower of the field,</hi> of a fading impotent condition, standing in need of something without it self for its protection and support. And a mistake in the choice of such helps, may sometimes prove fatal. Our conditions in this world are often in <hi>Scripture</hi> represented by a
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:62179:107"/>
state of <hi>warfare,</hi> wherein the virtues of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Hope</hi> are said to be our <hi>Brest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1 Thes. 5. 8. Eph. 6. 17.</note> our <hi>Shield,</hi> and our <hi>Helmet,</hi> the chief defensive arms, whereby we are to be guarded against all assaults. And some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by a state travelling by Sea, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Hope</hi> is our <hi>Anchor,</hi> that which must fix and keep us steddy in the midst of all <note place="margin">Heb. 6. 19.</note> storms.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. God alone is an all-sufficient stay, upon which the mind of man can secure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repose it self in every condition. For which reason he is in the <hi>Scripture</hi> phrase styled the <hi>Hope of Israel,</hi> the <hi>confidence of all the ends of the earth, and of such as</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Psal. 65. 5. Prov. 3. 26. Rom. 15. 13.</note> 
                        <hi>are afar off upon the Sea, the God of Hope.</hi> Which Titles he hath been pleased to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume unto himself, to teach us this les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, <hi>that our Faith and Hope should be in</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 21.</note> 
                        <hi>God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The principal conditions requisite in that person, who is fit to be a proper ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our confidence are these four:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Perfect knowledge and wisdom, to understand our conditions, and what may be the most proper helps and remedies for them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Unquestionable goodness, love, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, to be concerned for us, and to take care of us.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <pb n="194" facs="tcp:62179:108"/>
3. Sufficient power, to relieve us in every condition.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Everlastingness, that may reach to us and our posterity to all generations. All which are only to be found in God. From whence it will appear, that as he is the only proper object of our trust, so by not-trusting in him, we do deny to him the honour which is due to these Divine excellencies, and consequently are defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient in one of the chief parts of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. He alone hath perfect knowledg and wisdom to understand our conditions, and what may be the most proper remedy for them. <hi>His understanding is infinite.</hi> Our <note place="margin">Psal. 147. 5.</note> most secret thoughts and inward groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are not hid from him. He knows our diseases, and what Physick is fittest for us, the best means of help, and the most fitting season to apply those means. He is infinitely wise to contrive such ways of safety and deliverance, as will surmount all those difficulties and perplexities which would put humane wisdom to a loss. He doth sometimes accomplish his ends with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any visible means; <hi>filling mens bellies</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Psa. 17. 14.</note> 
                        <hi>with his hid treasure,</hi> making them to thrive and prosper in the world, by such secret ways as men understand not. And
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:62179:108"/>
sometimes he doth blast the most likely means, so that the <hi>battel is not to the</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Eccles. 9. 11.</note> 
                        <hi>strong, nor yet bread to the wise, nor riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill;</hi> but it may happen to them, as the <hi>Prophet</hi> speaks, that though <hi>they sow much, yet they bring in but little,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Hag. 1. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>they eat and have not enough, they drink but are not filled, they are clothed but not warm, earn wages but put it into a bag with holes.</hi> And therefore upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, there is very good reason why God should be the object of our <hi>confidence.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. He is likewise infinite as to his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Love, Truth, Faithfulness, whereby he is concerned for our welfare, and doth take care for us. The nearest and dearest relations which we have in the world, in whom we have most reason to be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, <hi>Our father and mother may forsake</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Psa. 27. 10.</note> 
                        <hi>us:</hi> And as for such whom we have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged by all imaginable kindness, they may deal deceitfully with us, and prove like <hi>winter brooks,</hi> which in wet seasons, <note place="margin">Job 6. 15.</note> when there is no need of them, will run with a torrent, but are quite vanished in a time of drought. Whilst we are in a prosperous condition they will be forward to apply themselves to us, with great professions of kindness and zeal; but if our condition
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:62179:109"/>
prove any way declining, they presently fall off and become strangers, forgetting and renouncing all obligations of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and gratitude, rather than run the least hazard or trouble to do us a kindness. That man hath had but little experience in the world, to whom this is not very evident. But now the mercy and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God <hi>is over all his works,</hi> and <note place="margin">Psal. 68. 5.</note> more especially extended to such as are in a state of misery, the <hi>fatherless</hi> and <note place="margin">145. 14.</note> 
                        <hi>widows,</hi> the <hi>prisoners,</hi> the <hi>poor,</hi> and the <hi>stranger. He is the helper of the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">146. 9. Psal. 10. 14.</note> That which amongst men is usually the chief occasion to take off their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and kindness, namely, misery and affliction, is a principal argument to entitle us to the favour of God, and therefore is frequently made use of by good men in H. <hi>Scripture</hi> to that purpose. <hi>O go not far from me, for trouble is nigh at hand,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Psal. 22. 11.</note> 
                        <hi>and there is none to help me; I am in misery, O hear me speedily.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. He is of infinite Power, for our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief and supply in every condition; being able to <hi>do whatsoever he pleaseth both in heaven and in earth, and in the sea, and</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Psal 135. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>in all deep places.</hi> He is the first cause of every thing, both as to its being and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. We depend wholly upon his power,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:62179:109"/>
not only for the issues and events of things, but likewise for the means. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis in <hi>Scripture</hi> made an argument why we should not trust in riches, or in any worldly thing, <hi>because power belongs to God.</hi> And 'tis elsewhere urged for a <note place="margin">Psa. 62. 10, 11.</note> reason why we should <hi>trust in the Lord for ever, because in the Lord Jehovah is everlasting strength.</hi> And upon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration <note place="margin">Isa. 26. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>Abraham</hi> is said to have <hi>hoped</hi>

                        <hi>against hope,</hi> being <hi>fully perswaded that what God had promis'd he was able to perform.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. He is everlasting, whereas all other helps and comforts which we can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to our selves are transient and fading. <hi>As for our fathers, where are they? And</hi>

We see by daily experience, persons of great hopes and expectations, when their Patrons dye upon whom they had their dependance, to what a forlorn and helpless condition they are reduced: But now this can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:62179:110"/>
befall the man <hi>who trusteth in the Lord, and whose hope the Lord is.</hi> And 'tis one <note place="margin">Jer. 17. 7.</note> of the greatest priviledges of Religion, that it doth furnish a man with such a sure refuge and support against all kind of exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, whereby he may bear up his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit under those difficulties wherewith others are overwhelmed.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true indeed, it cannot be denied, but that God doth expect, and the nature of things doth require, that men should be suitably affected with joy or sorrow, according as their conditions are; but yet with this difference, that those who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Providence of God, should not be so deeply affected with these things as other men, they should <hi>weep as not weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and rejoice as not rejoicing.</hi> They should not upon any occasion fear or sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row as <hi>men without hope,</hi> but should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mean themselves as persons that have an higher principle to be acted by, and to live upon, than any of these sensible things.</p>
                     <p>I cannot omit to suggest one Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion concerning this duty of <hi>Affiance,</hi> which I have now been insisting upon; That though this particular virtue, and others of the like affinity, be evidently <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral duties,</hi> our obligation to them being clearly deducible from the light of nature
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:62179:110"/>
and the principles of reason, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently must be owned by the Heathen Philosophers; yet they do in their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, speak but sparingly, concerning those kind of virtues which are of a more spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual nature, and tend most to the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating and refining of the mind. And on the other side, the Scripture doth most of all insist upon the excellency and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of these kind of graces. Which is one of the main differences, betwixt the Scripture and other moral Writings. And for this reason it is, that in speaking of these graces and virtues, I do more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently allude to Scripture expressions.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Of the</hi> Love <hi>of God.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>SEcondly, As for those <hi>perfections</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Divine <hi>Will,</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, his <hi>Goodness,</hi> his <hi>Justice,</hi> his <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Faithfulness:</hi> The due apprehension of these, should excite in us the virtue of <hi>Love,</hi> with all the genuine fruits of it. By <hi>Love,</hi> I mean an esteeming of him, and a seeking after him as our only hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness.</p>
                     <p>So that there are two ingredients of this virtue of <hi>Love,</hi> Estimation and Choice.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. An <hi>Estimation</hi> of the judgment; a due valuation of those excellencies which are in the Divine nature, whereby we look upon God as the supreme Being <hi>in genere boni:</hi> From whom all created goodness is derived, and by conformity to whom it is to be measured. And this notion is the proper importance of the word <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> whereby we account a thing dear or pretious. And in this sense doth our Saviour oppose <hi>despising</hi> to <hi>loving, Either he must hate the one, and love the other; <note place="margin">Mat. 6. 34.</note>
                           <pb n="201" facs="tcp:62179:111"/>
or he must hold to the one, and despise the other.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now these perfections of the Divine nature may be considered, either absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or relatively.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Absolutely,</hi> as they are in themselves, abstracting from any benefit that we our selves may have by them. And in this sense they can only produce in us an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem of our judgments, without any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire or zeal in our will or affections. The Devil doth understand these absolute per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the Divine nature, that God is in himself most wise, most just, and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful: And he knows withal that these things are good, deserving esteem and veneration; and yet he doth not love God for these perfections, because he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self is evil, and is not like to receive any benefit by them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Relatively,</hi> with reference to that advantage which may arrive to us from the Divine goodness. When men are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of their infinite need of him, and their misery without him; and that their utmost felicity doth consist in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of him: This is that which proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provokes affection and desire, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, his relative goodness as to us. There is scarce any one under such transports of
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:62179:112"/>
love, as to believe the person whom he loves, to be in all respects the most vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, wise, beautiful, wealthy that is in the world. He may know many others, that do in some, if not in all these respects, exceed. And yet he hath not an equal love for them, because he hath not the same hopes of attaining an interest in them, and being made happy by them. So that this Virtue doth properly consist in such a kind of esteem, as is withal ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with a hope and belief of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting our own happiness by them. And this is properly the true ground and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of our love to God. From whence will follow</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Our <hi>choice</hi> of him, as being the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proper object of our happiness, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring him before any thing else that may come in competition with them. Not only (as the Scripture expresseth it) lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him <hi>above father and mother,</hi> but <note place="margin">Mat. 10. 3. Luk. 14. 26. Philem. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>hating father and mother, yea and life it self for his sake: Counting all other things but dross and dung,</hi> in comparison of him.</p>
                     <p>Now it cannot otherwise be, but that a due apprehension of the Divine excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies in general, especially of his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular goodness to us, must excite in the soul suitable affections towards him. And
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:62179:112"/>
hence it is, that the misapprehension of the Divine nature, as to this Attribute, doth naturally produce in men that kind of superstition styled <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, which imports a frightful and over-timorous no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Deity, representing God as austere and rigorous, easily provoked by every little circumstantial mistake, and as easily appeased again by any flattering and slight formalities. Not but that there is sufficient evidence from the principles of natural reason, to evince the contrary; but the true ground of their mistake in this matter, is from their own vitious and corrupt affections. 'Tis most natural for selfish and narrow men, to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves the rule and measure of perfection in other things. And hence it is, that according as a mans own inclinations are, so will he be apt to think of God; <hi>Thou thoughtest that I was altogether such an one</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Psa. 50. 21.</note> 
                        <hi>as thy self.</hi> Those that are of ill natures and of little minds, whose thoughts are fixed upon small and low matters, laying greater weight upon circumstances, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutes, addresses, than upon the real worth of persons and substantial duties, being themselves apt to be provoked unto wrath and fierceness, upon the omission of these lesser circumstances, and to be pacified
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:62179:113"/>
again by any flattering and formal ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices; such men must consequently think themselves obliged to deal just so towards God, as they expect that others should deal with them. And according to the different natures and tempers of those men who do mistake this notion of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine goodness, so are the effects and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences of this mistake various (as a learned man hath well observed) When <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> of Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition.</note> it meets with <hi>stout</hi> and <hi>sturdy</hi> natures, who are under a consciousness of guilt, it works them to Atheism, hardens them to an opposition of him, to an endeavour of undermining and destroying the notion of that Deity, by whom they are not like to be safe or happy. If with more <hi>soft</hi> and <hi>timorous</hi> natures, men of base and slavish minds, it puts such men on to flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and collogue with him, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiate his favour by their zeal in lesser matters. And though in this kind of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and carriage there may be a shew of Religion, yet the terminating of it in such things is most destructive to the nature of it, rendring all converse with the Deity irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som and grievous, begetting a kind of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and praeternatural zeal, instead of that inward love and delight, and those other genuine kindly advantages which should
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:62179:113"/>
arise to the soul from an internal frame of Religion.</p>
                     <p>And that the perfections of the Divine nature, and particularly his Goodness, should excite our love of him, may be made evident by all kind of proofs. There being no kind of motive to affection, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>imaginary</hi> or <hi>real,</hi> but 'tis infinitely more in God than in any thing else be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides. I shall mention only these three things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. His absolute goodness and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. His relative goodness and kindness to us.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The necessity we are under of being utterly lost and undone, without an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest in his favour.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. His absolute perfections are infinite, being the original of all that good which we behold in other things. Whatever attractives we find diffused amongst other creatures, by which they are rendred amiable, they are all derived from him, and they are all, in comparison to him, but as little drops to the Ocean. There is much of loveliness in the fabrick of this beautiful world, the <hi>glorious Sun, the Moon and the Stars which he hath ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi> which is abundantly enough to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:62179:114"/>
the notion and the <hi>name of him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent in all the earth.</hi> We may perhaps know some particular persons so very emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent for all kind of accomplishments, <hi>vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,</hi> and <hi>wisdom,</hi> and <hi>goodness,</hi> &amp;c. as to contract an esteem and veneration from all that know them. But now the highest perfections that are in men, besides that they are derived from him, are so infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely disproportionable to his, that they may be said not to be in any of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.

The highest and truest self-love, is to love that which can alone make us happy.</q> Men do not need any motive or argument to perswade them to love themselves. 'Tis a <hi>natural principle,</hi> rather than a <hi>moral duty;</hi> they must do so, nor can they do otherwise. Only this is that wherein they stand in greatest need of direction, how to set this natural principle on work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on its due object. Felicity must be eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mans chief end, there is no need of perswading any one to that; all the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty is to convince men, wherein this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness doth consist. And there is no rational considering man, but must needs grant it to be in the fruition of the first and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme good; so that to love God as our happiness is to love our selves, beyond which there is nothing to be said or fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyed by way of motive or perswasion.</p>
                     <p>'Tis a duty this, upon all accounts, so plain and reasonable, that no man what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever can pretend to any kind of doubt or dispute about it. And therefore I shall add no more by way of proof or confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the necessity of it.</p>
                     <p>I shall only offer two considerations, which should engage mens utmost dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and caution in this matter.</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <pb n="210" facs="tcp:62179:116"/>
1. 'Tis a business of greatest consequence, to know whether we truly love God.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. 'Tis a matter wherein we are very liable to mistake.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. 'Tis a business of unspeakable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, to understand whether we love God or not: It being the same thing as to enquire, whether there be any thing in us of true Religion, or not. 'Tis not a question about the fruits or the branches, but about the root; not about the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, but about the very essence of grace and holiness. There being no <hi>medium</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt loving God and hating of him. <hi>He that is not with me, is against me,</hi> (saith our <hi>Saviour), Luke</hi> 11. 23.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And then 'tis a matter wherein men are liable to mistake. There is naturally <hi>in all Nations of men, who dwell on the face of the earth,</hi> a kind of confused in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination towards God, <hi>whereby they seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him,</hi> as the Apostle speaks. <note place="margin">Acts 17. 27.</note> And men are apt to mistake this natural propension for the grace of Love; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as this is rather an inclination, than a firm choice and resolution; rather a natural disposition, than an acquired or infused habit. None could have more confident perswasions of their love to God, and
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:62179:116"/>
their zeal for him, than the <hi>Jews</hi> had; and yet our <hi>Saviour</hi> tells them, <hi>But I know</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Joh. 5. 42.</note> 
                        <hi>you, that you have not the love of God in you.</hi> 'Tis not an outward profession, though accompanied with zeal, that is a sufficient argument of our love. Though there are many in the world, who both live and dye under this delusion, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 22. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny will say unto me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name, and in thy name have cast out Devils, and in thy name done many wonderful works. And then will I profess unto them, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver knew you, depart from me you that work iniquity.</hi> 'Tis not the being gifted and called, for these extraordinary works of prophesying and miracles; 'tis not an ability to undergo the flames of martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and the giving our bodies to be burned: Neither gifts nor priviledges, nor some particular acts of duty, though of the most noble kind and greatest diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, can be a sufficient evidence of this love. So that 'tis a matter wherein men are very liable to mistake, and where a mistake will prove of infinite consequence. And therefore will it concern us, to be very considerate and cautious in our enquiry about it.</p>
                     <p>There is one kind of affection seated in
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:62179:117"/>
the <hi>rational</hi> part of the soul, the <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing</hi> and <hi>will;</hi> and another in the <hi>sensitive,</hi> the <hi>fancy</hi> and <hi>appetite.</hi> The one consisting in a full conviction, deliberate choice, and firm resolution; the other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting more in some sudden <hi>impetus</hi> and transport of desire after a thing. The first of these may be styled the <hi>virtue,</hi> the other the <hi>passion</hi> of love. Now though a man should, in some fits of devotion, love God with as great a degree of fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor, as to passionate sensitive love, as some <hi>Martyrs</hi> have done; yet were it possible for him in his judgment, to esteem any thing else but equally, or never so little more than God; such a kind of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, though it were sufficient to make the other a Martyr, yet could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve him from being an Apostate, and renouncer or blasphemer of Religion (as a learned <hi>Author</hi> hath proved more at large); <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Pinke.</hi>
                        </note> nay, I add further, from the same <hi>Author,</hi> though a man should love God with an equal degree of affection, yet because the objects are so infinitely disproportionable, and 'tis the nature of moral duties to be measured from those motives by which we are to be induced to them; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of such an one it may be affirmed, that he doth not love God. He that makes
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:62179:117"/>
him but equal to any worldly thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may be said infinitely to despise and undervalue him.</p>
                     <p>For the further explication of this, I shall suggest to you a distinction, not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly (if at all) taken notice of by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, betwixt <hi>natural principles</hi> and <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral duties.</hi> The misunderstanding of which is the occasion of many difficulties and confusions, about this and some other points.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. By <hi>natural principles,</hi> I mean such kind of impressions as are originally stamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the nature of things, whereby they are fitted for those services to which they are designed in their creation; the acts of which are necessary, and under no kind of liberty of being suspended: All things must work according to their natural principles, nor can they do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise; as heavy bodies must tend down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. The beauty of the world, and the wisdom of the Creation, is generally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to consist in this, that God was pleased to endue the kinds of things, with such natures and principles, as might accommodate them for those works to which they were appointed. And he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns all things by such laws, as are suited to those several natures which he had at
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:62179:118"/>
first implanted in them. The most uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal principle belonging to all kind of things, is self-preservation, which in man (being a rational Agent) is somewhat farther advanced to strong propensions and desires of the soul after a state of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, which hath the predominancy over all other inclinations, as being the supreme and ultimate end, to which all their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs and actions must be subservient by a natural necessity.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Whereas on the other hand, those rules or means which are most proper for the attaining of this end, about which we have a liberty of acting, to which men are to be induced in a moral way, by such kind of motives or arguments as are in themselves sufficient to convince the reason: These I call <hi>moral duties; duties,</hi> as deriving their obligation from their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducibility to the promoting of our chief end; and <hi>moral,</hi> as depending upon mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral motives. So that self-love, and the proposing of happiness as our chief end, though it be the foundation of duty, that <hi>basis</hi> or <hi>substratum</hi> upon which the Law is founded, yet it is not properly a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral duty, about which men have a liberty of acting. They must do so, nor can they do otherwise. The most vile and profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:62179:118"/>
wretches that are, who are most op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite to that which is their true happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, they are not against happiness it self, but they mistake about it, and erroneously substitute something else in the room of it. So that if men were upon all accounts firmly convinced, that God was their chief happiness, they would almost as necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily love him, as hungry men do eat, and thirsty men do drink. I have enlarged somewhat the more upon this particular, the better to manifest the true cause or ground of this love, to consist in this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion, that our chief happiness is in the favour of God, and the enjoyment of him.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Of</hi> Reverence <hi>and the</hi> Fear <hi>of God.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THirdly, As for those kind of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which should be wrought in us, more especially from the apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Divine Power;</hi> these are <hi>reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, fear, humility,</hi> a submissive and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lial awe, which is so suitable to the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Omnipotence, and so necessary a consequence from it, as not to be sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated.</p>
                     <p>By this <hi>reverence,</hi> I mean, such an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, aweful, and ingenuous regard towards the Divine nature, proceeding from a due esteem and love of him, whereby we are rendred unwilling to do any thing which may argue contempt of him, or which may provoke and offend him. 'Tis a duty which we owe to such as are in a superior relation, and is in the fifth Commandment enjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under the name of <hi>Honour;</hi> which in the notion of it doth imply a mixture of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Fear,</hi> and in the object of it doth suppose <hi>Goodness</hi> and <hi>Power.</hi> That power which is hurtful to men, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:62179:119"/>
of goodness, may raise in their minds a dread and terror, but not a reverence and an honour. And therefore all such doctrines as ascribe unto God what is harsh, and rigorous, and unworthy of his infinite goodness, instead of this <hi>filial,</hi> do beget a <hi>servile</hi> fear in men. This is the meaning of that citation in St. <hi>Austin,</hi> where he mentions it as <hi>Varro</hi>'s judgment, <hi>Deum a religioso vereri, a superstitioso ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meri.</hi> The passion of fear and dread be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to superstitious persons, but the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of reverence to those that are religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. And that of <hi>Seneca, Deos nemo sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>

                     <p>But as for this reverence, or filial fear, it is so essential to a state of Religion, that not only the Scripture, but the <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Moralists</hi> likewise do describe Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion it self by this very name of <hi>fearing God.</hi> And men who are pious and devout, are by the <hi>Gentiles</hi> styled <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, men of reverence and fear.</p>
                     <p>Now though every one of the Divine
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:62179:120"/>
perfections may justly challenge this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection as due to it, particularly his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite <hi>wisdom</hi> and <hi>goodness,</hi> yet doth it more particularly belong to his <hi>power.</hi> I shall speak briefly of each of these.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. For his <hi>infinite knowledg</hi> and <hi>wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> which are things that have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways counted venerable. He knows all our infirmities and most secret faults, and therefore ought to be feared upon that account. 'Tis a notable saying in <hi>Cicero</hi> to this purpose; <hi>Quis non timeat omnia providentem &amp; cogitantem, &amp; animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertentem, &amp; omnia ad se pertinere pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantem, curiosum &amp; plenum negotii Deum.</hi> 
                        <q>Who would not fear that God who sees and takes notice of all things, so curious and full of business, as to have a particular concern for every action and person in the world.</q> And in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place he makes this notion of the Deity, and the fear consequent thereupon, to be the chief <hi>basis</hi> of Government, the first foundation of that civil policy where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by men are gathered together and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in regular societies. <hi>Sit persuasum</hi>

                        <q>This is one of
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:62179:120"/>
the first principles, which men who would associate under government, ought to be convinced of, that God takes par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular notice, what kind of person eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one is, with what mind and devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he applies himself to the duties of Religion, and will deal with men accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as they are pious or impious.</q> From whence will follow, such a fear of offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him by any dishonest action, as must make men capable of living under go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. His <hi>goodness, holiness, kindness,</hi> and <hi>mercy,</hi> do afford another reason why he ought to be feared; though these are the most immediate objects of our love and joy, yet will they likewise afford ground for our reverence. We read in one Text, of <hi>fearing the Lord and his goodness;</hi> which <note place="margin">Hosea 3. 5.</note> is, when men have such a sense of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, as thereby to be affected with an holy awe and fear of offending him.

                        <hi>with him, that he ought to be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> The meaning of which place may be this, We stand in continual need of pardon and remission, being utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done without it; and God only doth give this, and therefore upon this account we ought to reverence and fear him.</p>

3.

Now nothing is more natural to men, than to fear such as have power over them, and are able to help or to hurt them. The Civil Magistrate is to be feared and reverenced upon this account, because <hi>he bears the sword, and is a revenger:</hi>

that it is a check and restraint to a man in his liberty, and consequently brings disquiet to his mind; which is so far from truth, that on the contrary it may be manifested, that one of the greatest pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges belonging to a state of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, doth arise from this true fear of God, as being that which must set us at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from all other tormentful fears. That which hath the greatest influence upon the troubles and discontents of men in the world, whereby their conditions are ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred uncomfortable, is their inordinate fear, those misgiving thoughts and sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, whereby they are apt to multiply their own dangers, and create needless troubles to themselves. And whatever a mans outward condition may be, as to the security and flourishing of it, yet whilst such fears are in his mind, <hi>His soul doth not dwell at ease,</hi> as the phrase is; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, <note place="margin">Psa. 25. 13.</note> 
                        <hi>he that fears the Lord, his soul shall dwell at ease, i. e.</hi> such an one need not be afraid of any thing else. <hi>Discat timere, qui non vult timere; discat ad tempus esse solicitus qui vult esse semper securus,</hi> saith St. <hi>Austin;</hi> 
                        <q>He that would not fear other things, let him learn to fear God; let him be cautious and solicitous for a time, that would be everlastingly secure.</q>
                        <pb n="222" facs="tcp:62179:122"/>
And in another place, <hi>Homo time Deum &amp; minantem mundum ridebis;</hi> 
                        <q>O man, learn to fear God, and thou wilt despise the threatnings of the world.</q> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>Exhorresce quod minatur Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens, ama quod promittit Omnipotens, &amp; vilescet mundus sive promittens sive ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens;</hi> 
                        <q>He that hath a true fear of what the Omnipotent God doth threaten, and a love to what he promises, to such an one the world whether smiling or frown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will seem contemptible.</q> The hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and earth, and men, are all but his instruments, and cannot do any thing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise than as they are permitted or act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him. Though they should seem to be angry with us, yet he can restrain their wrath, and when he pleaseth can recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile them to us. But if he himself be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, none of these things will be able to afford us any comfort or relief. 'Tis above all other things the most fearful <hi>to fall into the hands of the living God.</hi> That's a notable speech to this purpose, which I find cited out of <hi>Plutarch;</hi> 
                        <q>They that look upon God as the chief rewarder of Good and Evil, and fear him accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, are thereby freed from other perplexing fears.</q> Such persons, <hi>minùs animo conturbantur, quam qui indulgent vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiis
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:62179:122"/>
audentque scelera,</hi> 
                        <q>have more inward peace than others who indulge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in their vices, and dare commit any wickedness.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>And as on the one side, the more men have of this fear towards God, the less they have of other fears: So the less they have of this, the more subject are they to other fears. Amongst the many judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments denounced against the want of this fear of God, the Scripture particularly mentions a fearful mind, <hi>If thou wilt not fear that glorious and fearful name, the</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Deut. 28. 58.</note> 
                        <hi>Lord thy God, the Lord will make thy plagues wonderful,</hi> &amp;c. And this is reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as one of them, <hi>The Lord shall give thee</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">ver. 65.</note> 
                        <hi>a trembling heart.</hi> And if we consult experience, there are none more obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in this kind, than prophane Atheisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal persons, who by their vile doctrines and practices, endeavour to harden them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and others against this fear of God. None so cowardly and timorous as these, none so easily frightened with the least appearance of danger. The <hi>Satyrist</hi> of old observed it of them:
<q>
                           <l>Hi sunt qui trepidant, &amp; ad omnia ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gura pallent.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="224" facs="tcp:62179:123"/>
None are so fearful, as those that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend not to fear God at all. And 'tis but justice, that those who will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence him as <hi>sons,</hi> should be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with dread and astonishment towards him as <hi>slaves.</hi> And this conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration ought to be no small inducement to men, to labour after this disposition. As <hi>Abimelech</hi> said to the men of <hi>Sichem, Judg</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Judg. 9. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>I pray you, whether it be better for you, that threescore and ten persons reign over you, or that one reign over you.</hi> So in this case, consider whether it be better for you, to be distracted by the great variety of worldly cares and fears, which as so many Tyrants, will domineer over you, and keep you in perpetual slavery, or to submit your selves to this one fear, the fear of God, which is perfect peace and liberty.</p>
                     <p>To all which may be added, That it is by this fear that we are to give unto God the glory of his Power and Justice. 'Tis this that must make us pliable to his will, and effectually remove all such obstacles as may hinder us from submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to him; subdue our reluctancies, and make us bow down before him. Upon which account this expression of fearing
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:62179:123"/>
                        <hi>God</hi> is frequently used in Scripture for the whole business of Worship and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; because where this fear is well fixed in the heart, all other parts of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness and righteousness will naturally fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
                     <p>It hath a more peculiar influence to stir up in us watchfulness and caution, and like a wary friend is apt to sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest to us the safest counsel and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. 'Tis the vigilant keeper of all virtues, that which must fortifie us in our temptations, and restore us in our lapses.</p>
                     <p>He that will but seriously ponder up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what the meer light of nature di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates, concerning the Omnipotence of him who is the great Creator and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the world, his infinite holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and justice, and that wise Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which extends to every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar person and action, whereby he takes notice of them, and will be sure to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or punish them, according as they are good or evil: Such an one, must needs have his heart affected with a great awe and dread towards the Divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>

1. <hi>Active.</hi> Which consists in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of mind to do what God shall injoin.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Passive.</hi> In an acquiescence of mind under what he shall inflict. Both which do necessarily flow from the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Gods <hi>dominion</hi> over us, his right to govern and dispose of us as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth. <hi>Obedience,</hi> in the true notion of it, being nothing else but that homage which we owe to such as are in a superior rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who have a right to command us. Every relation of superiority and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion being a distinct engagement to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection; whether <hi>Oeconomical,</hi> as that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Parent</hi> and <hi>Child; Political,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Magistrate</hi> and <hi>Subject; Moral,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Benefactor</hi> and <hi>Beneficiary;</hi> or lastly, that which is <hi>Natural,</hi> which above all other things gives the highest title to dominion, as that betwixt the <hi>Maker</hi> and his <hi>Work,</hi> the first Cause and that which he bestows being upon. And God by all these Titles, and many more, may justly challenge do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over us.</p>
                     <p>Under this first kind of Obedience, sty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Active,</hi> are comprehended these three particulars: 1. A knowledg of, and an acquaintance with those Laws which we are to observe. 2. A consent to them, or an approbation of them. 3. A conformity to them.</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <pb n="229" facs="tcp:62179:125"/>
1. An acquaintance with the Laws of God; whether discovered to us by <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> (the principles of nature obliging us, to observe and submit to all things which we have reason to believe do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from God); or by natural light, abstracting from Scripture and revelation, as the substance of that which we call the Moral law is. Now though such persons on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, are under the obligation of those Laws which depend upon revelation, to whom a revelation is made and sufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed; because Promulgation is essential to a Law: Yet the Moral Law being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable by natural light, to every man, who will but excite the principles of his own reason, and apply them to their due consequences; therefore there must be an obligation upon all men, who have but the use of their reason, to know these Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Laws; and the ignorance of them must be an inexcusable sin. <hi>Ignorantia juris</hi> can be no plea in this case, because the Law is written in every mans heart by nature, and the ignorance of mankind, as to any part of it, hath been wilfully contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                     <p>The duties concerning natural worship, our adoration of the Deity by affiance, love, reverence, praying to him, expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:62179:126"/>
mercies from him, returning to him our thanks and acknowledgments, being reverent and solemn in all our addresses towards him, our thoughts and speeches of him, and of the things that refer to his service, may be evidently inferred from those natural notions, which we have concerning the excellencies of his Nature, and our own dependance upon him.</p>
                     <p>The duties which concern the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of our own and our neighbours well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, that mutual justice, charity, help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, which we are to exercise towards one another; these may each of them be deduced from that common principle of self-love, whereby every one doth natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally seek his own well-fare and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation. We are all of us desirous that others should be just to us, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to help us, and do good to us; and because 'tis a principle of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est equity and reason, that we should be willing to do to others, as we desire and think them obliged to deal with us, this must therefore oblige us to the same acts of charity and helpfulness towards them. Now the drawing out of these general rules, and fitting them to particular cases; a studious and inquisitive endeavour, to
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:62179:126"/>
find out what our Masters will is, in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral relations and circumstances, this I call the duty of <hi>knowing the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> And 'tis necessary, that they should be thus distinctly <hi>known,</hi> before a man can <hi>keep</hi> them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. A consent to them, or approbation of them, as being <hi>haly, just,</hi> and <hi>good.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 12</note> Which will necessarily <hi>follow</hi> from a true notion of the ground and reason of them, and must necessarily <hi>precede</hi> a genuine obedience and conformity to them. He that looks upon them as fetters and bonds, doth rather indure them out of necessity, than obey them out of choice and love. <hi>I consent to the Law, that it is good,</hi> saith <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 16</note> the <hi>Apostle,</hi> that is, I do in my judgment own the fitness and reasonableness of the things therein injoined, as being the most proper means to advance the perfection of our natures. <hi>The law of the Lord is</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Psal. 19. 7</note> 
                        <hi>perfect</hi> (saith the <hi>Psalmist);</hi> not only <hi>formaliter,</hi> in it self, but also <hi>effectivè</hi> as to us, it makes us to be so. And in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, <hi>Thy law is the truth,</hi> namely, such as it ought to be. There is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity <note place="margin">119. 142.</note> betwixt our well-beings, and the nature of the things enjoined. And it is this conviction alone, that must beget in us, a love of it, and a delight to practise
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:62179:127"/>
it. He that harbours any prejudice in his mind against the ways of God, as if they were unprofitable, or unequal, can never submit to them willingly, but out of a constraint; he may look upon them as his task and burden, but not as his joy and delight. Our external submission to the Law, can never be kindly and regular<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> till our minds be cast into the same mould with it, and framed unto a suitableness and conformity to it. And such a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per doth, in the judgment of <hi>Seneca,</hi> ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the mind truly great and noble, <hi>Hic est magnus animus qui se Deo tradidit.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>De Vita Beata,</hi> 15.</note> And in another place, <hi>In regno nati su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, Deo parere libertas est.</hi> 
                        <q>Such a man hath a truly great and generous mind, who can resign up himself to Gods disposal. The greatest liberty is to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the Laws of our Soveraign.</q> 
                        <hi>His service is perfect freedom.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. An observance of them, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to them in our lives. This is the end both of the Commandments them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and likewise of our knowleldg and approbation of them, namely, the practice of holiness and virtue in the conduct of our lives; whereby we are to be advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced unto that state of happiness, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the perfection of our natures, and our
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:62179:127"/>
resemblance of the Deity doth consist.</p>
                     <p>And because the best of men do fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently fall short of that obedience, which is due to the Laws of God; therefore in case of transgression, natural light doth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect men to repentance, which is an hearty sorrow for our neglects and violations of the Divine Law, accompanied with a firm and effectual purpose and resolution of amendment for the future. Which though it do suppose the Commandments of God not to have been duly observed, yet is it the only remedy left in such cases.</p>
                     <p>Some have questioned, whether there be any obligation upon us for this, by the light of nature; partly, because the <hi>Stoicks</hi> deny it; and partly, because reason will tell a man that it cannot afford any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation to Divine justice. To which I should say, That the <hi>Stoicks</hi> indeed do deny this, because it implies passion, which their <hi>wise man</hi> must be without; yet they will admit a man to be displeased with himself for any error or mistake, which is much the same thing with sorrow, though under another name. And though this be not enough to satisfie infinite justice, yet it is that which reason doth oblige us to. We expect from those who offend us, that they should profess their sorrow and shame,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:62179:128"/>
beg pardon, and promise amendment. And the men of <hi>Nineveh</hi> did upon a Natural principle betake themselves to this reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and with good success, though they were doubtful of it, <hi>Who can tell if God</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Ion. 3. 9.</note> 
                        <hi>will turn and repent?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This conformity to the Law of God requires a twofold condition,

                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Regularity;</hi> in the due proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our love, and zeal, and observance, according to that difference which there is in the true nature and consequence of the things themselves; preferring <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>obedience,</hi> before <hi>sacrifice;</hi> and the <hi>weighty matters of the Law,</hi> before <hi>tything of mint and cummin; righteousness</hi> and <hi>peace,</hi> before <hi>meat</hi> and <hi>drink.</hi> 'Tis true, the least commandment is not to be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, as having stamped upon it the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tority of the great God: But then we are to consider, that the same autority by which that is injoined, doth oblige us to prefer other things before it. So that a
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:62179:128"/>
man doth disobey in doing a good thing, when upon that account he neglects what is far better. And the mistake of men about this, is the true cause of that which we call Superstition which is one of the opposites to Religion, and so destructive to the true nature of it. Men being apt to think themselves priviledged for their neglects and failings in some greater mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, by their zeal about lesser things.</p>
                     <p>Now nothing will contribute more to banish this Superstition out of the world, than a sober enquiry into the nature and causes of things, whereby we may be able to take a just estimate of their evidence and importance, and consequently to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion our zeal about them.</p>
                     <p>I mention this the rather, because it hath been by some objected, that humane Learning and Philosophy doth much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispose men for this humble submission to Divine Laws, by framing their minds to other notions and inclinations than what are agreeable to Religion.</p>
                     <p>But that this is a false and groundless prejudice, may be made very evident; The true knowledg of the nature of things, being amongst natural helps, one of the most effectual to keep men off from those two extremes of Religion, <hi>Superstition</hi> and <hi>Prophaneness.</hi>

                     <p n="2">2. For <hi>Prophaneness;</hi> this doth consist in a neglect or irreverence towards sacred things and duties, when such matters as ought to have our highest esteem, are rendered vile and common. And this like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise doth proceed from ignorance of the true nature of things. Now one of the best remedies against this, is the study of Philosophy, and a skill in nature, which will be apt to beget in men, a veneration for the God of nature. And therefore to those Nations who have been destitute of Revelation, the same persons have been both their <hi>Philosophers</hi> and their <hi>Priests;</hi> those who had most skill in one kind of knowledg, being thought most fit to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct and direct men in the other. And if we consult the stories of other places and times, we shall constantly find those Nations most solemn and devout in their worship, who have been most civilized and most philosophical. And on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, those other Nations in <hi>America</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> whom <hi>Navigators</hi> report to be
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:62179:129"/>
most destitute of Religion, are withall most brutish and barbarous as to other Arts and knowledg.</p>
                     <p>It cannot be denyed indeed, but that a slight superficial knowledg of things, will render a man obnoxious either to Superstition, or to Atheistical thoughts; especially if joined with a proud mind and vicious inclinations. He that hath made some little progress in natural enquiries, and gotten some smattering in the phrases of any <hi>Theory,</hi> whereby (as he conceives) he can solve some of the common <hi>Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena,</hi> may be apt to think, that all the rest will prove as easie as his first begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning seems to be; and that he shall be able to give an account of all things: But they that penetrate more deeply into the nature of things, and do not look upon second causes, as being single and scatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but upon the whole chain of them as linked together, will in the plainest things, such as are counted most obvious, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg their own ignorance, and a Divine power; and so become more modest and humblé in their thoughts and carriage. Such inquisitive persons will easily discern (as a noble <hi>Author</hi> hath well expressed it) that the highest link of Natures Chain is fastened to <hi>Jupiter's</hi> Chair.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="238" facs="tcp:62179:130"/>
This (notwithstanding it be a digres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion) I thought fit to say, by way of vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication and answer to those prejudices, which some men have raised against hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Learning and the study of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, as if this were apt to dispose men unto Atheistical principles and practices. Whereas a sober enquiry into the nature of things, a diligent perusal of this vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume of the world, doth of it self natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally tend to make men regular in their minds and conversations, and to keep them off from those two opposites of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, <hi>Superstition</hi> and <hi>Prophaneness.</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Of</hi> Passive Obedience, <hi>or Patience and Submission to the Will of God.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THus much may suffice concerning the nature and duty of <hi>Active</hi> Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
                     <p>I proceed to that of <hi>Passive</hi> Obedience, or patient submission under the afflicting hand of God.</p>
                     <p>And though this may seem one of the most difficult of all other duties, and most repugnant to humane nature; yet is there no subject more excellently discussed by the <hi>Heathen Moralists,</hi> and wherein they seem more to exceed themselves, than this.</p>
                     <p>I shall mention out of them some of those passages, which seem to me most apposite and material to this purpose, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der these four <hi>heads,</hi> which contain the several Arguments to this duty; <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <pb n="240" facs="tcp:62179:131"/>
1. Such as refer to God, by whose Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence all our sufferings are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd, or permitted.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Such as concern our selves.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Such as may be derived from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of affliction.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. And lastly, such as refer to this grace of Patience.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. There are many Arguments to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us of the reasonableness of this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, from the Nature and Attributes of God, who either sends affliction, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits them to fall upon us. I shall rank them under these three heads: 1. His <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite knowledg</hi> and <hi>wisdom.</hi> 2. His <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> and <hi>patience</hi> towards us. 3. His <hi>pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> and <hi>dominion</hi> over us.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. From the consideration of his <hi>infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite knowledg</hi> and <hi>wisdom,</hi> whereby he takes notice of, and doth concern him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self about every particular event in the world, making <hi>all things beautiful, and in their time,</hi> disposing of all to the best. Which is an argument, that divers of the <hi>Heathen</hi> Philosophers do very largely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist upon. Particularly, <hi>Antoninus,</hi> who <note place="margin">lib. 6. 39.</note> hath this passage: <q>If God (saith he) do not take particular notice of, and
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:62179:131"/>
care for me and my affairs, why do I at any time pray to him; and if he doth exercise a special providence towards all events, no doubt but he doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult well and wisely about them, nor would he suffer any hurt or prejudice to befall me, unless it were for a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er good upon some other account, And in this I ought to acquiesce.</q> And in another place saith the same <hi>Author.</hi> 
                        <q>I <note place="margin">Lib. 8. 23.</note> refer every thing that befalls me to God, as the contriver of it, by whom all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents are disposed in a wise order.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are also many great and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent sayings in <hi>Epictetus</hi> to this purpose. <note place="margin">Lib. 4. 6. 7.</note> 
                        <q>That must needs be much more desire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, which is chosen by the wisdom of God, than that which I chuse.</q> A reluctancy against the Divine will, is the ground of all Irreligion and Atheism in the world. <q>Why may not a man refuse <note place="margin">Lib. 1. c. 23.</note> to obey God in what he commands, as well as to submit to him in what he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts? And then what ground can there be for any pretence to Religion? We should all <hi>(saith he)</hi> conform our minds to the will of providence, and most willingly follow whither ever he shall lead us, as knowing it to proceed from the best and wisest contrivance. I do <note place="margin">Enchyrid.</note>
                           <pb n="242" facs="tcp:62179:132"/>
in my judgment more consent to that which God would have, than to that which my own inclinations lead unto. I would desire, and will just so, and <note place="margin">Dissert. 3. 7. 2. 26.</note> no otherwise than as he doth.</q> And in another place, <q>Use me as thou pleasest, I do fully consent, and submit to it, and shall refuse nothing which shall seem good unto thee. Lead me whither ever thou wilt, put me into what condition thou pleasest, must I be in a private, not in a publick station, in poverty not in wealth, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, I will not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to it, but make it my business to apologize for it, to justify and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain before all men, such thy dealing with me to be most fitting and prudent, most suitable and advantageous to my condition.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>And besides the reasons to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose from natural light, which are so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently improved and urged by some of the <hi>Philosophers,</hi> there are likewise seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral attestations of this nature in Scripture, wherein God is said to <hi>afflict out of faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness.</hi> To be <hi>Wise in counsel,</hi> and <hi>excellent</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Psal. 119. 75.</note> 
                        <hi>in working,</hi> signifying all the works of his providence to be most excellent, because
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:62179:132"/>
they proceed from the wisest counsel.</p>
                     <p>And though some particular dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may seem unto us to be difficult and obscure, <hi>His judgments being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searchable, and his ways past finding out;</hi> yet we may be most sure that there is an excellent contrivance in all of them. <hi>Though clouds and darkness may be round about him, yet righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his throne.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And besides the more general assertions which the Scripture doth frequently men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to this purpose, It doth likewise more particularly insist upon those spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial reasons and ends, whereby the wisdom of such dispensations are to be justified; as namely, <hi>To make us partakers of Gods</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 11.</note> 
                        <hi>holiness; to work in us the peaceable fruits of righteousness;</hi> to save us from <hi>being condemned with the world;</hi> to preserve <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 32.</note> in us a holy awe and reverence, <hi>They have no changes, therefore they fear not God, Psal.</hi> 55. 19. To quicken our rel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish of those mercies which we enjoy, and our thankfulness for them: To wean our affections from the things of this world; to prevent the surfeits of prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, to enlarge our experience, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract such a kind of hardiness, and cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age as may become a militant state; to
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:62179:133"/>
keep up in our minds a continual sense of our dependent condition; which are some of the principal things, wherein our happiness doth consist.</p>
                     <p>To which may be added, that the <hi>Scripture</hi> doth likewise contain several express promises, to assure us of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit and advantage to be had by the crosses that befall us. That <hi>all things</hi> in the issue <hi>shall work together for our good, Rom.</hi> 8. 28. So that there is not a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or affliction that we meet with, which we could be without, but it hath its necessary place and work, in that frame and design of events, which the providence of God hath ordained, for the bringing of us to happiness. And though all of them may <hi>for the present seem grievous,</hi> and some of them perhaps not suitable to the Divine goodness and promises; yet of this we may be most as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured, that all the <hi>ways of the Lord, are</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Psal. 25. 10.</note> 
                        <hi>mercy and truth, to such as keep his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant and his testimonies.</hi> And there are few persons who have been obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of Gods dealings towards them, but are able to say from their own experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that <hi>it is good for them, that they have been afflicted.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="245" facs="tcp:62179:133"/>
2. A second Argument to this purpose, is from the consideration of Gods <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> and <hi>patience</hi> towards us. I have shewed before from several acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the <hi>Heathen,</hi> what apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they had of the Divine goodness and forbearance towards sinners, from whence 'tis easie to infer the equity and reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness of our patient submission under his afflicting hand. He is <hi>merciful and</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Exod. 34. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>gracious, longsuffering, abundant in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and truth.</hi> The <hi>Apostle</hi> speaks of <note place="margin">Rom. 2. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering.</hi> He doth indulge us in our failings, and infirmities, with such a kind of tenderness, as nurses use to their young children. Now there is all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable equity in this consequence, that if he bear with us in what we cannot law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully do, that we should bear with him, in <hi>doing what he will with his own.</hi> If he be patient towards us in our sinning against him, when we oppose and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke him, 'tis but reason that we should be patient in our sufferings from him, when he endeavours to heal and reclaim us.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It is of the Lords mercies that we are not consumed, and because his compassions</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Lam. 3. 22.</note> 
                        <hi>fail not.</hi> 'Tis a great argument of favour
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:62179:134"/>
and tenderness, that God is pleased to spare us in the midst of our provocations. 'Twere but justice if he should suddenly snatch us out of this life, and cast us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Hell: If he doth abate any thing of this, <hi>He doth then punish us less than our iniquities deserve,</hi> and we have more reason to praise him, than to complain against him: <hi>For he hath not dealt with us after our sins, nor rewarded us accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our iniquities.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He that considers the mercies he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys, as well as the evils he suffers, and will impartially compare them both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, may find that though his <hi>afflictions do abound,</hi> yet <hi>his consolations do much more abound;</hi> and that upon the whole <note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 5.</note> matter, when his condition is at the worst, 'tis much better than what he himself deserves, or what many others enjoy.</p>
                     <p>They that are sensible of every thing they enjoy as being the free gift of God, will not murmur against him, when he is pleased to resume any thing from them. There must needs be much unreasonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and want of equity in that disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which cannot bear with some suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings from that hand, from which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all our enjoyments. <hi>Shall we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive good at the hand of God, and shall <note place="margin">Job 2. 10.</note>
                           <pb n="247" facs="tcp:62179:134"/>
we not receive evil?</hi> The evils we suffer are much short of our desert, the good we enjoy is much beyond our deserts. And therefore upon either account, it must be highly unreasonable for a man to be guilty of impatience and murmuring. <hi>Iniquus est qui muneris sui arbitrium danti non relinquit,</hi> saith <hi>Seneca;</hi> 
                        <q>That man <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Ad Polyb. cap.</hi> 29.</note> must needs be unjust and unequal, who doth not think fit to leave the Giver unto the liberty of his own gift, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume it again when he pleaseth.</q> And such an one may justly be reputed gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, who is more sensible of loss in the restoring of a thing, than of gain in the enjoyment of it. He is an ingrateful wretch, who complains of that as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, which is but restitution of what was freely lent. And he is a fool, who knows not how to receive benefit by good things, any otherwise than by the present fruition of them.</p>
                     <p>So <hi>Epictetus,</hi> speaking concerning the <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Dissertat. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 26.</note> unreasonableness of murmuring at any cross events, he hath this passage. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. <q>What reason have I to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God? Why should I desire things not desireable? He that gave hath pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to take, and why should I resist? This would not only be great folly, to
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:62179:135"/>
oppose one that is much stronger, but great injustice likewise, to fight against a benefactor. You have received all that you have, and your own very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from him, and why should you take it so heinously, if he is pleased to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume something back again?</q>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. The consideration of the Divine <hi>power</hi> and <hi>dominion over us,</hi> must needs engage us to a quiet submission under his hand. There are many excellent dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses to this purpose amongst the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi> Philosophers, as particularly in <hi>Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca.</hi> 
                        <q>There is nothing (saith he) more desireable than for a man to arrive un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this temper of mind, to be able in all troubles and afflictions, to quiet himself with this thought, <hi>Diis aliter vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum est;</hi>
                        </q> 
                        <q>God thinks not fit to have it so, and therefore I ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent;</q> which is the same sense with that in the <hi>Scripture, It is the Lord Jehovah, let him do what seemeth good unto him.</hi>

Now the great Law-giver who governs the world, is our common Master and Ruler, and his Will is the only Law we are to submit unto.

                     <p>Besides these testimonies from some of the wiser <hi>Heathen,</hi> the <hi>Scripture</hi> likewise doth abound in several attestations to this purpose, as particularly that in <hi>Job</hi> 34. 31, <hi>Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have born chastisement, I will not offend any more; that which I see not teach thou me, if I have done iniquity, I will do so
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:62179:137"/>
no more.</hi> And <hi>chap.</hi> 33. 12, 13, <hi>God is greater than man, why dost thou strive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him? He gives not account of any of his matters.</hi> As if he had said, <hi>that</hi> man doth strangely forget his condition, who by his murmuring and repining doth think to call God to an account; why, he is the supreme Lord of all, and may do whatever he pleaseth. <hi>Should not the potter have power over the clay?</hi> There is no man but must think it just that the potter should dispose of his clay as he pleaseth, giving it such a shape, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing it to such a use as he shall think meet. And can any one judge it reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, that God should have less power over us, than we have over the works of our hands? <hi>Behold O Lord thou art our father, we are the clay and thou art the potter,</hi> Isa. 64. 8. <hi>Wo to him that striveth with his maker, shall the potsheard strive with the potsheards of the earth? shall the clay say to him that fashioneth it, what makest thou? or thy work, he hath no hands?</hi> Isa. 45. 9. This sin of impatience and murmuring is here styled <hi>striving against God;</hi> contesting with his wisdom and his power, saying to him, <hi>what makest thou,</hi> which reflects upon his <hi>wisdom;</hi> and <hi>he hath no hands,</hi> which
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:62179:138"/>
reflects upon his <hi>power,</hi> as if he were not able <hi>extremam apponere manum,</hi> to finish what he had begun; both which are not only high affronts to the Divine nature, but exceeding foolish and mischievous in the consequence of them. The mutual contention of men amongst themselves, <hi>testa cum testis,</hi> one potsheard with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, may prove fatal to them: If two earthen vessels dash together, they can get nothing by it, they may both be broken; but for the clay to strive with the Potter, that is so foolish and so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal a contention, as nothing can be more, and must needs expose it to the worst of dangers. Murmurers are in the <hi>Scripture-</hi>phrase styled <hi>children of rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Numb.</hi> 17. 10. Because they that speak against God, would actually resist him likewise, if they could.</p>
                     <p>If we receive all that we are or have, our beings and our well-beings from God, nothing can be more evident, than that he may justly resume any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, or inflict upon us any evil, that is either short of, or but equal unto, the good he hath bestowed upon us.</p>

2. I proceed to the second sort of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to this purpose, from the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of our selves;</hi> which I shall treat of in these three particulars. 1. We are men. 2. We are sinners. 3. We are living men. Upon each of which grounds it will appear a very unreasonable thing, that we should murmur and complain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God. The <hi>Prophet</hi> hath put these three considerations together. <hi>Why doth a living man complain, a man for the</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Lam. 3. 39.</note> 
                        <hi>punishment of his sin?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. We are <hi>men,</hi> which is a mercy far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove any temporal affliction that we can suffer. God might have made worms in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of men, such despicable creatures as are below common notice. Whereas in being men, we are become Lords of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, having an excellency a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all other creatures that ever God made, excepting the Angels. And is it not a shame for such an one, to be a slave to every slight trouble? that any <hi>light affliction, which is but for a moment,</hi> should make our souls which are <hi>immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi> to bow down under it? Should not the nobility of our natures advance us to a more generous temper, and make us erect and chearful under such troubles? see how <hi>David</hi> was affected with this
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:62179:139"/>
thought. <hi>Lord! what is man that thou</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Psal. 8. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>art mindful of him, or the son of man that thou visitest him?</hi> 'Tis a mercy and a condescension to be admired, that God doth so much as take notice of us, though with his chastisements, and therefore ought not to be the ground of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint. He might suffer us to go on se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely in our sins, without any restraint. We do not think our selves concerned to take notice of every little fly or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sect, or the poor worms under our feet. And therefore when he shall take such special care of us, as to restrain us in our wandrings, to administer Physick to us in our diseases, we ought upon this account, rather humbly to thank and admire him, than to murmur against him.</p>
                     <p>Again, we are <hi>but men;</hi> creatures of a dependant being, not Lords of our own happiness. <hi>And who art thou O man that repliest against God?</hi> how vile and despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable in comparison to him, and how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to judge of his ways?

                     <p>But are all complaints then in affliction unlawful? To this I answer:</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <pb n="267" facs="tcp:62179:144"/>
1. Natural expressions of grief are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable. A man must be sensible of his sufferings, and consequently cannot but grieve under them. That stupor and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nummedness of spirit, whereby men are made unapprehensive of their afflictions, is in it self both a great sin and a great judgment.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But then these expressions of our grief must be rightly qualified with their due circumstances:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. They must not be <hi>disproportionable</hi> to the <hi>occasion.</hi> A great complaint for a little cross, like <hi>Jonah</hi>'s trouble for his gourd.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Not <hi>unsitting</hi> for the <hi>manner;</hi> not accompanied with bitter invectives against second causes and instruments; they should rather express our humility, than our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. They must not be <hi>immoderate</hi> for the <hi>degree;</hi> as if we were without hope, like <hi>Davids</hi> passionate complaints for the death of his son <hi>Absolom.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. They must not be <hi>sinful</hi> for the <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of them, blaming Gods justice, and reviling his providence.</p>
                     <p>And now that I have so abundantly shew'd the reasonableness of this vertue
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:62179:145"/>
of <hi>patience</hi> and <hi>submission,</hi> I am still sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible how hardly men are brought to it when there is real occasion for the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of it; and therefore I think it may be of great use to add some <hi>directions</hi> which may help to prevent, or at least abate our impatience under afflictions, and to promote this submissive temper and disposition. And accordingly they shall be of two sorts, some <hi>negative,</hi> others <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I begin with the <hi>negative.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. Take heed of aggravating afflictions, beyond their due proportions. Do not fix your eye or your thoughts, chiefly upon the smart of them, without regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the benefit of them? 'Tis true indeed (as the <hi>Apostle</hi> tells us) <hi>No affliction is</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 11.</note> 
                        <hi>joyous for the time, but grievous, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless afterwards it yieldeth the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able fruit of righteousness, to them that are exercised thereby.</hi> 'Twere an unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable thing and an argument of great frowardness, for a patient to mind only the bitterness of his potion, the corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siveness of his plaister, without having any regard to the remedy and the health which may be procured by them. For a man always to have his hand upon his sore, will encrease the pain, and hinder
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:62179:145"/>
the cure of it. To insist upon every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular circumstance whereby men may aggravate their afflictions, is the ready means to add fuel to their impatience, and to drive them to despondency. This is a sure way to bring upon our selves much needless trouble. 'Tis all one as if a man should chew the pills which ought to be swallowed whole, which will make us more sick, and thereby rather hinder the due operation of them than promote it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Beware of refusing comfort, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting the means that are afforded us for our relief and support under the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles that befall us. This were to take part with our disease against our selves, to refuse the physick, and to pull off the plaister that should heal us; which ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues much frowardness, besides the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ingratitude of rejecting <hi>the conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of God, as if they were but small</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Job 15. 11.</note> 
                        <hi>to us,</hi> as <hi>Eliphaz</hi> speaks. Whatever our losses or disappointments are, he can be ten times better to us, than those things are, by the loss of which we are provoked to discontent and murmuring.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Do not give liberty to passions; which of all other things belonging to the soul, are most impetuous and unruly,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:62179:146"/>
if not restrained within fitting bounds, The sensitive appetite (to which the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions belong) is the inferior and brutish part of the soul, answerable to the dregs of the people in a political government, of themselves apt to be heady, tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, rash, mutinous, if not restrained by some superiour power: So is it with the passions of the soul, which therefore ought to be watched over, with great circumspection; and the rather, because they have usually the Empire over us, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring our younger years, before reason comes to exercise its soveraignty: And if once we give way to them, 'twill be a busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of no small difficulty, to reduce them into order again.</p>
                     <p>Those very thoughts which occasion much discontent and trouble to the soul, whilst they lay in the brest in a huddle and confusion, if they be but distinctly considered, and coolely debated, will seem much less, if not vanish into nothing. 'Tis the nature of disorder, to make things appear more than indeed they are. Which is one reason that <hi>Philosophers</hi> give why the stars seem innumerable, because they are commonly looked upon, as being wildly scattered up and down, out of all regular form. 'Tis so likewise with mens
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:62179:146"/>
inward discontents, which are exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly multiplyed by the confusion of them; and would appear much less, if but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly reduced and examined. Most of those which occasion much perplexity, whilst they are mixed with many others in a crowd, would upon a clear view and severe examination, appear much less considerable: And that's another good means for the preserving of our minds from this impatience; To put a stop to our passions in the beginning of their course, before they be in their full car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rear, and then grow too hard for us.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Do not chiefly regard the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of your troubles, which will be apt to provoke impatience and distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; but rather upon the supreme dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser of them. Though men may deal ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unworthily with us, yet God is just in all his ways. This was that which sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied old <hi>Eli, It is the Lord, let him do</hi>

                        <pb n="273" facs="tcp:62179:147"/>
'Tis worth your notice to observe the strange variety of <hi>Davids</hi> carriage, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as he was either mindful or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getful of this consideration.

When he looks upon God, he submits, and is silent. <hi>I was dumb and opened not my mouth, because thou didst it.</hi> But <note place="margin">Psal. 39.</note> when he considers the instruments, his heart begins to rise, and his passions to tumultuate and ferment into a strom.</p>

to its just rate and value; and this will be a means to work in us weaned af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections from the world. They that love too much, must grieve too much.

                     <p n="1">1. Labour for true apprehensions of the Divine nature and excellencies; his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite power, and wisdom, and goodness. When our hearts are once possest with right notions, and a due esteem of these perfections, they will not be so apt to break out into murmuring against him.

                        <note place="margin">1 King. 20. 3.</note>

that hath lent it us doth resume it again. It is, or should be our daily prayer, that Gods <hi>will may be done on earth as it is in heaven.</hi> And it were a most unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable thing, for men to murmur at the grant of their petitions. 'Twas a notable saying, which is commonly reported of <hi>Luther,</hi> when <hi>Philip Melancthon</hi> was much disquieted in his own thoughts, at the confused state of things in the first Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation; <hi>Monendus est Philippus, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat esse rector mundi:</hi> 
                        <q>
                           <hi>Melancthon</hi> is to be admonished that he would cease to take upon him the government of the world, as if the issue of things did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to his care.</q> God is infinitely wise and faithful, and will proportion our suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 13.</note> to our abilities.

                     <p n="2">2. Consider the mercies you enjoy, as well as the evils you suffer. That was a most unworthy temper in <hi>Ahab,</hi> and in <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> to receive no satisfaction in all their great possessions and enjoyments, because they were disappointed in some one small particular. 'Tis the advice of the <hi>wise man,</hi> Eccles. 7. 14. <hi>In the day of prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity rejoice, in the day of adversity consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</hi> But what is that which we should
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:62179:149"/>
consider? Why, <hi>that God hath set the one against the other:</hi> And so should we too, set one against another; and then we shall find, that we have as much reason to be patient under our sufferings, as to rejoice in our mercies. 'Tis a remarkable passage <hi>that,</hi> concerning <hi>Mephibosheth;</hi> when <hi>Ziba</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">2 Sam. 19.</note> had by his false accusation, caused the King to confiscate his goods, and bestow them upon himself; this had been enough one would think, to provoke <hi>Mephibo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth</hi> unto high complaints, both against the injustice of <hi>David,</hi> and the baseness and unfaithfulness of his Servant <hi>Ziba:</hi> But see how he demeans himself, <hi>I have</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">ver. 27, 28.</note> 
                        <hi>been slandered unto my Lord the King, but do what is good in thine eyes. Thou hast set thy servant amongst them that eat at thine own table, what right therefore have I to cry any more unto the King?</hi> Where he makes the kindness that <hi>David</hi> had formerly shewn him, to weigh down and satisfie for the wrong that he then suffered. And if men had but such a grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful temper of spirit, they would not be so apt to murmur. Those that deserve least, do usually complain most. The most unworthy are the most impatient.</p>
                     <p>Suppose all manner of evils and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which are now promiscuously seat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered

up and down in the world, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they concern soul or body; spiritual blindness and obduracy, poverty, slavery, reproach, sickness, pain, maimedness, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I say, suppose all these were now to be distributed amongst mankind, so as every one were to have an equal share of them: Would you be content to stand to this new distribution? I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose there are not many persons in this Nation, in so miserable and forlorn a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that upon serious consideration of the special advantages they do or may partake of, above many other millions in the world, would consent to it. And if this be so, certainly then it must be both an unreasonable, and a very ungrateful thing for such men to be impatient, who enjoy more than their share comes to.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Consider the deserts of your sins, and then it will easily appear, that your condition is not at any time so bad, but you have deserved it should be worse.

The story concerns <hi>Joseph</hi>'s brethren, who coming into <hi>AEgypt</hi> to buy Corn, were there roughly treated, accused for spies, clapt into prison; so that one would have thought, they had reason enough to fret and murmur at that hard unjust dealing. And yet we find their carriage to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry humble and patient; but what that was which made them so, you may see, <hi>ver.</hi> 21. they remembred their cruelty to their brother. <hi>Joseph,</hi> and that brought them to acknowledg this distress to be deservedly come upon them, <hi>because they had not pityed their brother, when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought them in the anguish of his soul.</hi> The like consideration did stop <hi>Job</hi> in his complaint, after all his high contesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and arguings with God; he no sooner thought upon his own vileness, but he was presently silenced. <hi>Behold I am vile, what shall I answer thee, I will lay</hi>

                        <hi>Solomon,</hi> who is so much celebrated in <hi>Scripture</hi> for his wisdom and knowledg, hath purposely written a <hi>Book,</hi> the main argument whereof is to enquire, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:62179:154"/>
the chief happiness of man doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist: And having in the former part of it shewed the insufficiency of all other things that pretend to it, he comes in the conclusion to fix it upon its true <hi>basis,</hi> asserting every mans greatest interest and happiness, to consist in being religious. <hi>Let us hear the cnclusion. of the whole</hi>

                        <hi>matter; Fear God, and keep his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements: for this is the whole of man.</hi> That is, the serious practice of Religion is that which every considerate man af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all his other disquisitions, will find to be his chief interest, and that which doth deserve his utmost care and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</p>
                     <p>And because these words of <hi>Solomon,</hi> do so fully express that, which is to be the main argument of my following dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, I shall by way of preface or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction to it, more particularly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the commendation which he here gives to the practice of Religion, in that full and significant expression, <hi>this is the whole of man.</hi>

<pb n="288" facs="tcp:62179:155"/>
attested to by several of the wisest <hi>Heathen</hi> Writers, as may be enough to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy any serious man, who is able to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the reason and consequence of things, and will but attend and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First:</hi> Religion is of so great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, that the <hi>Essence</hi> of man may be said to consist in it. Man may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered under a twofold notion:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In his <hi>single capacity,</hi> according to that principle whereby he is constituted in such a rank of creatures.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In <hi>Society,</hi> for which man seems to be naturally designed, and without which he could not well subsist. Now Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will appear to be <hi>Essential</hi> to him, in both these respects.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. As considered in his <hi>single capacity,</hi> according to those principles by which he is framed. That which doth constitute any thing in its Being, and distinguish it from all other things, this is that which we call the Form or Essence of a thing. Now the things which distinguish Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature from all other things, are the chief <hi>principles</hi> and foundations of <hi>Religion,</hi> namely, the <hi>Apprehension of a Deity,</hi> and an <hi>expectation of a future state after this life:</hi> Which no other creature,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:62179:155"/>
below man, doth partake of; and which are common to all mankind, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the utmost endeavours that can be used for the suppressing of them.</p>
                     <p>As for what is commonly alledged in the behalf of <hi>Reason,</hi> it may be observed that in the actions of many <hi>brate crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> there are discernable some foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps, some imperfect strictures and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Ratiocination; such a natural sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacity as at least bears a near resemblance to reason. From whence it may follow, that it is not Reason in the <hi>general,</hi> which is the <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Humane nature;</hi> But Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son as it is <hi>determined</hi> to actions of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, of which we do not find the least signs or degrees in <hi>Brutes: Man</hi> being the only creature in this visible world, that is formed with a capacity of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping and enjoying his Maker. Nor is this any new opinion, but what seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the antient Writers, Philosophers, Orators, Poets, have attested to; who make the notion of a Deity, and adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him, to be the true difference betwixt <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Beast.</hi>

                     <p>'Tis true, nothing is more ordinary than for such persons as are <hi>sceptical</hi> in these first principles, to entertain great thoughts of themselves, as if they had considered things more deeply, and were arrived unto a higher pitch of reason and

The two chief Opposites to Religion, are <hi>Prophaneness</hi> and <hi>Superstition.</hi> Both which are prejudicial to civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the one by <hi>destroying</hi> conscience, the strongest obligation to political duties; the other by <hi>perverting</hi> and abusing it; introducing in the stead of it a new <hi>primum mobile,</hi> which ravisheth the spheres of Government, and puts them into a praeternatural course, as a <hi>Noble Author</hi>

                     <p>The two grand Relations that concern society, are <hi>Government</hi> and <hi>Subjection:</hi> And Irreligion doth indispose men for both these.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. For <hi>Government.</hi> Without Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Magistrates will lose that courage and confidence belonging to their stations, which they cannot so well exert in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing the offences of others, when they are guilty of the same or the like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. <hi>Those that sit on the throne of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, should be able to scatter away evil with their eyes,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> speaks, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20. 8.

as well as <hi>Power.</hi> And without this, Governours may easily lose that <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> which is due to them from others, and consequently that <hi>Authority</hi> which they ought to have over them. When they cease to be Gods in respect of their <hi>Goodness,</hi> they will soon diminish in their <hi>Power.</hi> And though they should be able to keep men under, as to their bodies and estates, yet will they decline as to that awful love and reverence whereby they should sway over the hearts and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Philosopher</hi> in the fifth <hi>Book</hi> of his <hi>Politicks,</hi> doth lay it down as a rule <note place="margin">Cap. 11.</note> for Magistrates, That they must be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to give publick testimonies of their being religious and devout; for which he gives this double reason: Because the people will be less subject to entertain any jealousie or suspition of <hi>suffering in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury,</hi> from such whom they believe to be religious: And withal, they will be less subject to attempt the <hi>doing of injury</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst such; as knowing that good Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates are after a more especial manner under the divine favour and protection, <gap reason="foreign">

2. The want of this will indispose men for the condition of <hi>Subjects,</hi> and render them loose and unstable in those duties of <hi>obedience</hi> and <hi>submission</hi> required to that state. How can it be expected from that man, who dares affront and despise God himself, that he should have any hearty reverence for His Deputies and Vicegerents?</p>
                     <p>He that is subject only upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>wrath,</hi> and the <hi>power of the sword which is over him,</hi> will be no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger so, when he hath an opportunity of escaping or resisting that power. Nor is there any possible way to secure men in their quiet subjection and obedience, but by their being obliged <hi>for conscience-sake.</hi> And therefore such kind of persons, as <note place="margin">Rom. 13. 5.</note> by their open prophaneness and contempt of Religion, do endeavour to destroy conscience from amongst men, may justly be esteemed as the worst kind of seditious persons, and most pernicious to Civil Government.</p>
                     <p>That temper of <hi>Prophaneness,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a man is disposed to contemn and despise all Religion (how slightly soever men may think of it) is much worse than <hi>Infidelity,</hi> than <hi>Fanaticalness,</hi> than <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;</hi> and of the two, 'tis much more eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible

for a man to be an <hi>honest Heathen</hi> and a <hi>devont Idolater,</hi> than a <hi>prophane Christian.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whatever disputes have been raised, concerning the lawfulness of punishing men for their dissenting consciences in matters of Religion; yet never any man questioned the lawfulness of punishing men, for their prophaneness and contempt of all Religion. Such men as renounce conscience, cannot pretend that they suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for it. And certainly this Vice doth upon many accounts deserve the greatest severity of Laws, as being <hi>in its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> destructive of the very principles of Government, and the peace of all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Societies: Besides the mischiefs <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent</hi> upon it, from Divine vengeance.</p>
                     <p>'Tis an observation of <hi>Seneca,</hi>

And as for any extraordinary Heroical action, by which the publick welfare is to be promoted, men that are without consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Religion, and a sense of Virtue, can never apply themselves to any thing of that kind, as having their minds de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute of all such principles as are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime and generous, without any the least seed of honour, and piety, and virtue; and therefore they can have no sparks of magnanimity, nor any the least inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to actions that are truly great and noble.</p>

So that upon all these accounts, it is very evident, That Religion is <hi>totum he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis</hi> in this first sense, as it refers to the <hi>Essence</hi> of Man, considered either in his <hi>single capacity,</hi> or as a member of <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety.</hi>

                     <p n="2">2. 'Tis so likewise as it refers to the <hi>Business</hi> and Duty of Man, that which he ought to be most intent upon, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant about, as to his employment in this world: that <hi>General</hi> calling, in which every man of what rank or qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity soever, is to be ingaged. Men are distributed under other <hi>particular</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, according as their education, abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, friends, and several opportunities do dispose of them. But the obligation of Religion, being of universal concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, doth extend to all and every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, there being none exempted from it. <hi>Hoc est omnis homo.</hi> Every man is concerned in it. And it is <hi>totum homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi> likewise; 'Tis his calling, the chief business about which he is to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed.</p>
                     <p>I do not say, that a mans thoughts are always to be taken up about the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate acts of Religion, any more than a Traveller is always to have his mind a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually fixed upon the thought of his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies

But yet, as he that is upon a journey, doth so order all his <hi>particular</hi> motions, as may be most conducible to his <hi>general</hi> end; so should men <hi>habitually,</hi> though they cannot <hi>actually,</hi> in every affair have respect to their chief end, so as to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve all the duties of Religion, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to allow themselves in any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the rules of it. And he that hath this care continually upon his mind (though he be but a secular person) may properly be said to make Religion his <hi>Business.</hi>

(i. e.)</hi> What was the chief employment or business, which they should apply themselves to in this world? And in the conclusion of his discourse, after an induction and refutation of all other particulars, which may seem to have any claim or pretence to this, He asserts it to be the business of Religion, <hi>Fearing God, and keeping his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:</hi>

Suitably to that <hi>Precept</hi> of <hi>Moses,</hi> Deut. 10. 12. <hi>And now, O Israel, what doth the Lord thy God require of thee, but to fear the Lord thy God, to walk in his ways, and to serve the Lord thy God, and keep his commandments:</hi> And the <note place="margin">Acts 24. 16.</note>

                     <p>To the Reasonableness of this, several of the wisest <hi>Heathens</hi> have attested. That's a remarkable passage in <hi>Aristotle</hi>

                     <p>There is another apposite Testimony to this purpose in <hi>Antoninus.</hi>

                     <p>Now 'tis the usual course of men to apply themselves to that as their chief business, by which their interest is most promoted, and which may most conduce to that main end which they propose to themselves. And can any thing be more reasonable, than for that to be the chief <hi>business</hi> of a man's life, which is the chief end of his <hi>Being?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. Religion is <hi>totum hominis,</hi> with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the <hi>Happiness</hi> and well-being of Man. That is properly said to be the chief end or Happiness of a thing, which doth raise its nature to the utmost per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of which it is capable, according to its rank and kind. This is the <hi>chief end</hi> which he ought to propose, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone wherein his true felicity doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist, that which doth advance his nature to the utmost perfection it is capable of. The chief good belonging to a Vegetable or Plant, is to grow up to a state of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity, to continue to its natural period,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:62179:163"/>
and to propagate its kind, which is the utmost perfection that kind of Being is capable of. And whereas sensitive crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, besides those things which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to them with Plants, have likewise such faculties, whereby they are able to apprehend external objects, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive pain or pleasure from them: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Happiness proper to them, must consist in the perfection of these faculties, namely, in sensible pleasures, in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of such things as may be grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to their senses. But now Mankind (if we allow it to be a distinct rank of Creatures, superior to Brutes) being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with such faculties, whereby 'tis made capable of apprehending a Deity, and of expecting a future state after this life; It will hence follow, That the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per happiness of Man must consist in the perfecting of these faculties, namely, in such a state as may reconcile him to the Divine favour, and afford him the best assurance of a blessed immortality here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after: Which nothing else but Religion can so much as pretend to.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true indeed, the nature of <hi>Man,</hi> by reason of those other capacities com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to him with <hi>Plants</hi> and <hi>Brutes,</hi> may stand in need of several other things, to

render his condition pleasant and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable in this world, as <hi>Health, Riches, Reputation, Safety,</hi> &amp;c. Now herein is the great advantage of Religion, that besides the principal work which it doth for us, in securing our future estates in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world, it is likewise the most effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual means to promote our happiness in this world.</p>
                     <p>In my discourse of this I shall first sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest something more <hi>generally,</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the nature of our chief end; And then descend to those <hi>particulars,</hi> which are esteemed to be the chief ingredients to a state of Happiness.</p>
                     <p>Under the <hi>first</hi> of these I shall speak briefly to these Three things.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. The chief end of every thing must be of such a nature, as may be most fit to promote the perfection of that thing in its rank and kind.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. This in rational Beings which are capable of it, must consist in a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with, and a conformity unto the chief Good, and consequently in being religious.</p>

                        <pb n="307" facs="tcp:62179:164"/>
1. There is a necessity that every man who will act rationally should propose to himself some chief scope or end. The having of an end, is not so much a <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral duty,</hi> which supposeth a liberty of acting, as a <hi>natural principle,</hi> like that of the descent of heavy bodies; men must do so, nor can they do otherwise. Such is the principle of self-preservation in all things; and this of acting for an end, in all rational agents. The most loose and profligate wretches that are, do and must act for an end, even in those very courses, wherein they put the thought of their future state and their last account far from them. The very suppressing and hardening themselves against the thought of their true end, is in order to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent peace and quiet, which they do er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneously substitute in the room of their chief end. That wherein men are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly defective, is in not exciting the thought of their chief end, and not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently considering and stating in their own minds, the most proper means for the attaining of it. There are too many in the world that do <gap reason="foreign">

                        <q>There ought always to be some particular scope and mark proposed, as the main end and drift of all our actions, as the star by which we are to be guided in our voyage.</q>

<pb n="309" facs="tcp:62179:165"/>
should be the main design of the whole. He that intends to shoot at any thing, must so manage the whole action, in le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling his arrow, and regulating his hands, and exerting his strength so as may be most advantageous for hitting the mark. As the <hi>efficient</hi> is in <hi>natural,</hi> so is the <hi>end</hi> amongst <hi>moral</hi> causes, of principal efficacy. 'Tis this which is the chief rule of all our actions. And therefore there is a necessity that some end be proposed and fix'd upon.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The chief end of every thing must be of such a nature, as may be most fit to promote the perfection of that thing in its rank and kind. Any thing that is short of this, may be a means, or a subordinate end; but cannot be the chief and ultimate end, if there be any thing desireable beyond it; <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>Now I shall endeavour to make it out by plain reason, that the Happiness of our condition, in all these respects, doth depend upon Religion. And that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>morally,</hi> upon account of that reward, which virtuous actions do entitle a man unto, from a just and wise providence; but <hi>naturally</hi> also, by reason of that <hi>phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical</hi> efficacy which the duties of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on have, to procure for us all those things wherein our temporal happiness consists; to promote the well-fare, not only of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular persons, but of publick Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of Mankind in general, and of the whole Universe.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>
                           <hi>How Religion conduces to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Happiness</hi> in this world: <hi>And first to the happiness of the</hi> Outward man. 1. <hi>In respect of</hi> Health.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>ANd because these things I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, (especially those of them which concern our external happiness in this world) are the great aims and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs, by which the generality of men are chiefly swayed in their actions; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore like to prove very powerful motives to make men religious, if they could be once effectúally perswaded, that Religion is the most proper means for the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of these things: I shall therefore en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to make out this truth, by the plainest and most convincing ęvidence that may be. And the rather because in such kind of assertions, as are besides the common opinion, and seem paradoxes, men will be apt to be jealous of their being imposed upon by some kind of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phism or Fallacy.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="315" facs="tcp:62179:168"/>
In order to this, I shall observe this method: First, I shall endeavour to state and define the nature of these things, and to shew wherein the true notion of them doth consist. And then proceed to the proof of this proposition, That Religion is the most proper means to procure and promote these ends. And besides the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence to this purpose, from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current <hi>opinions</hi> of wise men, in several ages; I shall likewise make them out both by <hi>reason,</hi> and by <hi>experience,</hi> which are all the kind of arguments that such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are capable of.</p>
                     <p>Only I must premise one Caution; that when I say Religion is the cause of these things, the meaning is not, that it is so necessary and so infallible a cause, as can never fail of its effect. This would not be consistent with our dependent condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there being nothing in this world so much under the power of humane en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, but that the providence of God may interpose for the disappointment of it. To whom it must be left, to make what reserved cases he pleases from the ordinary course of things. But though it be not an <hi>infallible</hi> cause, yet is it such a cause as doth <hi>generally</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, produce its effect: And all mankind do
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:62179:169"/>
think it a sufficient inducement, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply their endeavours unto such courses for the procuring of any thing, as are the best means to be had, and do for the most part effect the ends they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed for.</p>
                     <p>This being premised, I doubt not but to offer such arguments for the proof of these things, as shall be sufficient for the conviction of any man who will but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand and consider them.</p>
                     <p>I begin with the First. The wellfare of our <hi>present condition</hi> in respect of our <hi>outward-man</hi> doth depend upon Religion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> Religion is the best means for <hi>Health.</hi> By Health I mean such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of our bodies, whereby our members and faculties are inabled for the due performance of their natural functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and freed from pain; 'tis properly opposed to <hi>sickness</hi> or Disease. As for the infirmities of old age, these are so essential to all living creatures, so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily spring from the very principles of our natures, that though they may be somewhat lessened and alleviated, yet are they not capable of any complete re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.</p>
                     <p>This blessing of Health is so necessary to our well-beings in this world, that
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:62179:169"/>
without it, we cannot enjoy any thing else, no not our own selves; insomuch that men do, and may justly put a great value upon it, and are willing to purchase it at any rate. And therefore to all such, this consideration must needs be a very powerful motive.</p>
                     <p>Now I shall make it plain that this doth depend upon Religion

                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Religion is the <hi>natural</hi> cause of health, which may appear upon this two-fold reason; because it doth remove those things that will hinder it, and doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote such things as will help it.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It doth <hi>removere prohibens,</hi> it is apt to prevent and remove such things as are the great impediments of our health. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more evident, than that there are several vices which have a physical efficacy in the producing of diseases, as all kind of intemperance of body, all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate passions of mind; to one of which, the greatest part of the sickness amongst men may be ascribed; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently the virtues opposite to these, Temperance, Sobriety, Moderation, must needs have a natural causality for the hindring of these diseases. 'Tis by Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion that men are inabled to prevent all such excesses as are prejudicial to nature, to repress all such violent transports of passion, Hatred, Anger, Fear, Sorrow, Envy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as are in themselves very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:62179:170"/>
to our bodily health, and by that violent commotion, which they are apt to put the humours into, do sometimes cause present sickness, and always lay in us the seeds of future Diseases.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It doth <hi>promovere adjuvans,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote all such things as may most effectually conduce to the improving of our health; by obliging us upon the account of duty and conscience, to a careful observance of the most proper means to this end: Keeping us within due bounds in our eating, drinking, exercise; preserving our minds in an equal frame of serenity and calmness; supporting our spirits with contentation and chearfulness under e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very state of life; so that nothing can be more true than that of <hi>Solomon,</hi> That <hi>A cheerful mind doth good like a medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Prov. 17. 22. 15. 13. 12. 25.</note> 
                        <hi>and makes a healthy countenance;</hi> whereas <hi>heaviness</hi> and cares will break <hi>a mans spirit and make it stoop.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I know there are other means to be made use of in order to the procuring of health, various kinds of Medicaments to be applyed by the art of Physick, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the nature of several diseases shall require, which Religion doth oblige a man not to neglect: But yet this I think may be truely said, That those
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:62179:171"/>
who are most expert in the profession of Physick, are not able to prescribe any <hi>Catholicon,</hi> which shall more effectually operate, both by way of <hi>prevention</hi> and <hi>cure,</hi> than the observance of those duties which Religion and virtue do oblige us unto.</p>
                     <p>Nor is this true only in Theory and Speculation, but it may appear to be so upon common experience, to which I shall appeal for the further confirmation of it. What kind of persons are those who enjoy the best state of health and the longest lives? Are they not such ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally who are most sober and regular in their conversations, most temperate as to their <hi>bodies,</hi> most free from all kind of inordinate passions, fierceness, anxiety, cares as to their <hi>minds?</hi> 'Tis said of <hi>Moses,</hi> that <hi>though he were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Deut. 34. 7.</note> 
                        <hi>old, yet his eye was not dim, nor was his natural force abated.</hi> Which (amongst other causes) may be ascribed to those eminent virtues he was endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with, the temperance of his body, and meekness of his spirit. That <hi>beloved Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciple</hi> whose thoughts and writings seem to be wholly taken up with the Divine virtue of Love, is upon account of this temper of his mind, thought to have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:62179:171"/>
a more vigorous old age than any of the rest: Such a power is there in Religion, though not wholly to prevent the infirmities of old age, yet in a great measure to alleviate and abate them.</p>
                     <p>And on the other side, if we consult experience; Who are the men most ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to diseases? are they not such generally as are most vicious in their lives? most given to surfeits, debauche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and lewdness, whereby they do so far inflame their blood and wast their spirits, as not to live out half their days: Insomuch that no man of ordinary pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, who is to take a Lease for lives, will be content (if he can well avoid it) to chuse such a one whom he knows to be vicious and intemperate.</p>
                     <p>But these things are so obvious to common experience, that I need not enlarge upon them: Only I would not be mistaken. I do not say that none of those are Religious, who are liable to diseases, and are taken away in their younger years; or that all such are reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, who are free from diseases, and live to old age. Some may be naturally of so tender and brittle a make, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very little blow will break them; others of so tough and strong a constitution, as
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:62179:172"/>
to hold out against many batteries and assaults; and yet neither of these to be ascribed, either to the vices of the one, or the virtues of the other, but do ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther belong to their condition and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, which being natural, and not falling under the choice of our wills, is not therefore capable of any moral good or evil.</p>
                     <p>Besides, there ought allowance to be made (as I said before) for such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt cases, as shall seem good to the providence of God in the government of humane affairs. Some good men may be <hi>taken away from the evil to come,</hi> others may be exercised with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases in their bodies for the cure of their minds, or to make their patience and courage exemplary to others. And some that are good men for the main, may yet by their own carelesness in u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the fittest means for the preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their health, expose themselves to sickness; none of which can be any prejudice to the thing I have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. This being that which I affirm, that so far as the infirmities of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural tempers are capable of remedy by any thing in our power, It is the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:62179:172"/>
of the duties of Religion, that doth for the most part and generally prove the most effectual means to this purpose. Which is all I shall say to the <hi>first</hi> thing I proposed to speak to, concerning the health of our bodies.</p>

                     </p>

                     <p>By <hi>liberty,</hi> the being at our own dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal, and not under bondage, restraint, imprisonment.</p>

                     <p>I put these things together, because of their near affinity to one another.</p>
                     <p>Now Religion is both the <hi>moral</hi> and the <hi>natural</hi> cause of these things.</p>
                     <p n="1">

1. 'Tis the <hi>moral</hi> cause of them, upon account of that divine protection and assistance, which the light of nature will assure us we are intituled unto in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our duties; besides the many asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and promises in Scripture to this purpose; of being protected in our ways, and secured in times of danger. <hi>If you will</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Lev. 25. 18</note>

                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. 'Tis the natural cause of these bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, by preventing or removing all such things, whereby the contrary evils are occasioned. The most usual and general cause of mens sufferings, is from the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of their duty, and the violations of law; they are obnoxious to the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments of banishment, imprisonment, loss of goods, or of life, upon the account of some illegal irreligious acts, murder, theft, sedition, injuring of others, need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less contentions, medling in other mens affairs where they are not concerned. 'Tis
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:62179:174"/>
observable, that in the legal form of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diting men for crimes, our Law doth ascribe their guilt to their want of Religion, their <hi>not having the fear of God before their eyes,</hi> which doth dispose them to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit such acts as makes them obnoxious to legal punishment. Now nothing can so effectually prevent such things as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. This will teach men to obey laws, and submit to government: This will keep them within the bounds of their duty, both towards God and man: This will remove all those dividing principles, of selfishness, and pride, and covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: It will teach them charity and meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and forbearance, to study publick peace and common good, to be generous and large in their well-wishing and their well-doing: Which are the most proper means to provide for our own quiet and safety.</p>
                     <p>And the truth of this may be evident likewise from common experience; by which it will appear, that for the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, no kind of men do enjoy so much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal peace and freedom and safety, as those that are truly religious. The <hi>Apostle</hi> seems to appeal to that common notion in the minds of all men, concerning the safety belonging to innocence, when he
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:62179:174"/>
puts it by way of question, <hi>who is he that will harm you, if you be followers of that which is good?</hi> Implying, that 'tis a thing generally known and taken notice of, that there is a kind of natural reverence and awe amongst the worst of men, towards such as are innocent and virtuous.</p>
                     <p>And on the other side no men do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur so many hazards, molestations, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, as those that are vicious; what from their violations of law, their need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less provocations of those they converse with, being scarce ever free from danger and trouble; which the <hi>Wise-man</hi> seems to appeal to, as a thing evident from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, in those short questions which he proposes: <hi>Who hath wo? who hath sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row?</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Prov. 23. 29.</note> 
                        <hi>who hath contentions? who hath bablings? who hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of eyes?</hi> 'Tis particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly spoken of the drunkard, but 'tis proportionably true of other vices like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</p>
                     <p>There is one objection that lyes very obvious against what I have been proving; and that is from those <hi>Scriptures</hi> where 'tis said, that <hi>whoever will live godly in Christ Jesus, must suffer persecution,</hi> and that <hi>the world should hate them;</hi> besides what may be alledged from common expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:62179:175"/>
to this purpose, concerning the sufferings of some that are good men.</p>
                     <p>To this two things may be said by way of answer.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Every thing is not persecution for Religion, which men may be apt to style so. Some persons who for the main may be truly religious, may yet by their own follies and imprudence, expose themselves to needless sufferings. And in such cases, Religion is not to be charged as being the cause of their suffering, but their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in it, and mistakes about it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. There may be (as was said before) some exempt cases from the general rule, and such must those be granted to be, which concern times of persecution; when Religion will be so far from protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a man, that it will rather expose him to danger and sufferings. And such were those primitive times to which these <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> do refer, when it seemed good to divine providence, to make use of this as one means for the propagating of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity in the world, namely, by the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of those that professed it. And in such cases, when men are persecuted pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly upon the account of Religion, God doth usually compensate their outward sufferings with some inward advantage,
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:62179:175"/>
supplying them with such patience and courage, as will support them with joy and comfort in their suffering for that which is good. But then it must withall be granted, that these <hi>Scriptures</hi> are not equally applicable to such other times and places, when and where the true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is publickly professed and encouraged, when <hi>Kings are nursing fathers,</hi> and <hi>Queens nursing mothers</hi> to the Church; because in such times and places, the profession of Religion will be so far from hindering, that it will rather promote a mans secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar advantage.</p>

                     <p>THirdly, as to our Estates and Possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I shall shew that Religion is the cause of <hi>Riches.</hi> In order to the proof of this, the first thing to be enquired into, is, what is the true nature of <hi>wealth</hi> or <hi>riches,</hi> and wherein it may properly be said to consist. And here it is to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that the word <hi>Riches</hi> is capable of a twofold sense,
<list>
                           <item>Absolute,</item>
                           <item>Relative.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. In the more <hi>absolute</hi> sense, it may be defin'd to consist in such a measure of estate as may be sufficient for a mans oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions and conveniencies; when his pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions are so proportioned, as may fully answer all the necessities of his condition, and afford him a comfortable subsistence, according to his quality, the station
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:62179:176"/>
wherein he is placed. In which sense men of all ranks and degrees are capable of being rich. A Husbandman, or an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Tradesman may be as truly styled a rich man, as he that is a Gentleman, or a Lord, or a King. Though perhaps what these can very well afford to fling away upon their diversions, be more than all the estate and possessions which the other can pretend to. And upon this ground it is, that all men will grant, one person to be as truly <hi>liberal</hi> in giving but a <hi>pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> or a poor <hi>mite,</hi> as another in giving a <hi>hundred pounds,</hi> because these things are to be measured by the different con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the givers: And a man may as well be rich with a <hi>little,</hi> as <hi>liberal</hi> with a <hi>little.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. In the more <hi>relative</hi> sense, <hi>Riches</hi> may be described to consist in the having of large Possessions, when a mans Estate and Revenue is of such a proportion as is commonly esteemed <hi>Great;</hi> whether with relation to the generality of other men, and so only those at the upper end of the world are capable of being count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed rich; or else with respect to others of the same rank and order, and so all such are counted rich, who do in their pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions exceed the common sort of those
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:62179:177"/>
that are of the same rank with them; this kind of wealth consisting properly in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison: There being not any one deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate sum, or proportion of revenue, to which the name of riches may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated, but that it may be as much below the occasions of some persons, as it is above the condition of others who yet live plentifully.</p>
                     <p>Now the first of these is the only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per notion of <hi>Riches,</hi> because this alone is agreeable to the chief end of wealth, which is to free us from want and necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And the other may be rather styled, the being proprietour of great possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the meer having of which cannot denominate one a truly rich man for this plain reason; because though such possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be in themselves great, yet they may not be sufficient to free the owner of them from want and poverty, whether in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to his real or imaginary occasions for more: And that is not Riches which cannot free a man from being poor. And want of necessaries, is as truly poverty in him that hath much, as in him that hath but a little. He that in any one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of life, hath enough to answer all his conveniences, such a man is more truly rich than he whose revenue is a thousand
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:62179:177"/>
times greater, if it be not equal either to his occasions, or to his mind.</p>
                     <p>Now when it is said, that Religion is the cause of Riches, the meaning of this cannot reasonably be understood of Riches in the second sense, as if he that were religious should be thereby advanced to the greatest possessions that any man else doth enjoy, from the condition of a Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant or a Tradesman to that of a Prince. Because this would no more consist with those several degrees and subordinations required to the order of the Universe, than it would for every common Souldier to be a General, or every private man to be a King. But the meaning of this propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on must be, that Religion will be a means to supply a man with such a sufficiency as may denominate him rich; and to free him from such necessities, whether real or imaginary, as others of his rank and station are liable unto.</p>
                     <p>So that by what hath been said, it may appear, that the true notion of Riches doth comprehend under it these two things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. A sufficiency for a mans occasions and conveniencies.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. An acquiescence of mind, in so much as is in it self really sufficient, and which
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:62179:178"/>
will appear to be so, supposing a man to judg according to right reason.</p>
                     <p>And that this is not a meer fancy or notion, but the most proper sense of the word <hi>Riches,</hi> wherein all mankind have agreed, may be made very evident.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the <hi>first</hi> of these there can be no colour of doubt. All the scruple will be concerning the <hi>second;</hi> Whether that be necessary to make a man rich. And to this the <hi>Philosophers</hi> do generally attest. <hi>Aristotle</hi> in particular, doth affirm that the true nature of Riches doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Rhet.</hi> lib. 1. cap. 5.</note> in the contented use and enjoyment of the things we have, rather than in the possession of them. Those that out of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuriousness can scarce afford themselves the ordinary conveniences of life out of their large possessions, have been always ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted poor; nay, he that cannot use and enjoy the things he doth possess, may upon this account be said to be of all others the most indigent, because such a one doth truly want the things he hath, as well as those he hath not.</p>
                     <p>That man who is not content with what is in it self sufficient for his condition, neither is rich, nor ever will be so; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there can be no other <hi>real</hi> limits to his desires, but that of <hi>sufficiency;</hi>
                        <pb n="335" facs="tcp:62179:178"/>
whatever is beyond this, being bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less and infinite. And though men may please themselves with an imagination, that if they had but such an addition to their Estates, they should then think they had enough; yet that is but a meer imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there being no real cause, why they should be more satisfied then, than they are now.</p>
                     <p>He that is in such a condition as doth place him above contempt, and below envy, cannot by any enlargement of his fortune be made really more rich, or more happy than he is. And he is not a wise man, if he do not think so; nor is he in this either wise or worthy if he be so far solicitous as to part with his liberty, though it be but in some little servilities for the encreasing of his Estate.</p>
                     <p>These things being premised, it may be made very evident, that the design of being truly rich, that is, of having enough and being contented, will be most effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually promoted by Religion; and that both <hi>Morally</hi> and <hi>Naturally.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Morally,</hi> upon which account this is by the Philosophers owned to be one of the rewards belonging to virtue; good men only having a Moral title to wealth upon account of fitness and desert. There
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:62179:179"/>
are many assertions and promises in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to this purpose, of being prospered in our <hi>stores</hi> and <hi>labours,</hi> and <hi>all that we set our hands unto,</hi> of <hi>lacking nothing</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Psal. 34. 10</note> 
                        <hi>that is good for us.</hi> 'Tis this that must intitle us to the blessing of God, and 'tis <hi>the blessing of God that maketh rich. Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> speaking of <hi>Religion</hi> under the name of <hi>Wisdom,</hi> saith, that <hi>in her left hand</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Prov. 3. 16 c. 7. 8, 18. 8. 21.</note> 
                        <hi>are riches, durable riches,</hi> that she causes those that love her to <hi>inherit substance,</hi> and doth <hi>fill their treasures.</hi> And the <hi>Apostle</hi> tells us, that <hi>Godliness hath the promises of this life.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Religion is a <hi>natural</hi> cause of riches, with reference to those two chief ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients required to such a state; namely, the supplying of us with a plentiful suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency as to our possessions, and a satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction as to our minds.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. A sufficiency as to our estates and possessions. There are but these two ways that can contribute to the improving of mens possessions, namely, the <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> and of <hi>keeping.</hi> Now Religion is an advantage to men in both these respects. Nothing can be more evident than that there are many virtues which upon these accounts have a natural tendency to the increasing of mens estates, as diligence in
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:62179:179"/>
our callings, <hi>The diligent hand maketh rich;</hi> heedfulness to improve all sitting opportunities, of providing for our selves and families, being provident in our expences, keeping within the bounds of our income, not running out into need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less debts: In brief, all the lawful arts of gain and good husbandry, as to the exercise of them, are founded in the virtues which Religion teaches.</p>
                     <p>On the contrary it is plain, that there are many kind of sins, which have a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect natural efficacy for the impoverish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of men: As all kind of sensuality, and voluptuousness, idleness, prodigality, pride, envy, revenge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of all which may be said what <hi>Solomon</hi> says of one of them, that they <hi>bring a man to a morsel of bread, and clothe him with raggs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. And as for the second requisite to riches, satisfaction of mind with our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, and a free use of the things we enjoy. This is the property of Religion, that it can inable a man to be content with his estate, and to live comfortably without such things as others know not how to want. And the ability of being content with a little, may be much more truely called riches, than the having of
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:62179:180"/>
much, without being satisfied therewith. 'Tis better to be in health with a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate appetite, than to be continually eating and drinking under the disease of a voracious appetite or a Dropsy: And in this sense, <hi>A little that the righteous hath, is better than great riches of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Psal. 37. 16.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>But this may appear likewise from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. Let any man impartially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, what kind of persons those are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the generality of men, who in their several degrees and orders are count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed most able, and most wealthy, and it will appear that they are such as are most serious in the matter of Religion, most diligent in their callings, most just and honest in their dealings, most regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and sober in their conversations, most liberal towards any good work; upon which account it is, that such places, where men have the opportunity of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing instructed in, and excited to the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Religion, do thereupon thrive and flourish most; it being one property of Religion to civilize men, and make them more inquisitive in learning, and more diligent in practising their several professions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="339" facs="tcp:62179:180"/>
And as for contentment of mind, this being in it self a virtue as well as a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledg, it is not to be attained but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of Religion; nor are there any that enjoy it, but such as are true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly virtuous.</p>
                     <p>There are several objections that may be made against what I have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, but all of them capable of a plain and satisfactory solution.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. There are some kind of virtues that seem to have a contrary tendency; as charity to those that want, bounty and liberality to any good work, which in <hi>Aristotles</hi> judgment is scarce consistent <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Ethic. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 1.</note> with growing rich.</p>
                     <p>By that saying of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> may be meant riches in the second sense, as it denotes large possessions, which this vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of liberality doth not naturally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote; but it may very well consist with riches in the first and most proper notion of it, as it denotes sufficiency for our oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions; and the ability of contributing in some proportion, towards any worthy and charitable work, is in the esteem of every good man one of those occasions and conveniencies required to such a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency, and cannot any more be a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to it, than it would be for a
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:62179:181"/>
man to lay up some part of his wealth in the safest place, to lend it out upon the best interest, to part with it for the purchase of the same favour and assistance from others in the like exigencies; to lay it out upon his pleasure, with respect to that inward comfort and satisfaction, which doth accompany the conscience of doing worthy things. And besides all this, experience will assure us, that there is a secret blessing which doth for the most part accompany such actions; so that men grow the richer and not the poorer for them: And they that in this kind <hi>sow bountifully,</hi> do very often, even in this world, <hi>reap bountifully.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. There are some kind of vices that seem to have a tendency to the enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of men, as <hi>fraud, extortion, sordid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> all kind of unlawful ways of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and keeping an estate. But to this it may be said,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. These vices may tend to the encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of mens possessions, but not to the making of them truely rich: And 'tis a plain argument that such persons do not think themselves to have a sufficiency, who can apply themselves to such wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed courses for the getting of more.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="341" facs="tcp:62179:181"/>
2. 'Tis commonly seen upon experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that there is a secret curse attends such practises, a canker that eats into such gain, a hole in the bottom of the bag, by which it insensibly dreins out and wasts away. <hi>As the Partridg sitteth upon</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Jer. 17. 11.</note> 
                        <hi>eggs and hatcheth them not, so he that getteth riches, and not by right, shall leave them in the midst of his days, and at the end shall be a fool.</hi> As that silly bird doth sometimes take much needless care and pains, in sitting upon and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing subventaneous eggs, such as can never be fruitful, which (as <hi>Naturalists</hi> observe) that creature is very subject unto, or as the fecund eggs of that bird being laid upon the ground, are many times trod upon by passengers or wild beasts, after it hath bestowed much pains for the hatching of them: So are the wicked designs of gain often disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the <hi>Embryo;</hi> and the contrivers of them, instead of approving themselves to be more wise and subtile men than others, do appear at last to be fools. He that will carefully observe the usual course of things in the world, may from his own experience find instances enough, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm those sayings of the wise man; <hi>There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth, and <note place="margin">Prov. 11. 24.</note>
                           <pb n="342" facs="tcp:62179:182"/>

                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. There are some good men that are poor. And 'tis said that <hi>God hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen the poor of this world,</hi> to receive the <note place="margin">Jam. 2. 5.</note> Gospel and <hi>to be rich in faith.</hi> To this it may be said,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The providence of God may so or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it sometimes, as to reduce good men to great exigencies, <hi>to wander up and down in sheepskins and goatskins, being destitute, afflicted, tormented.</hi> But then these are such particular exempt cases, as are not suitable to the most usual and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral course of things. And besides, such as are good men, may sometimes be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective in several of those duties which Religion doth oblige them to, diligence, caution, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the poverty of such may justly be ascribed to their defect in Religion.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. As for that scripture that <hi>God hath chosen the poor in this world,</hi> It is not
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:62179:182"/>
to be understood in the more <hi>absolute</hi> sense, for such as want necessaries, because 'tis plain from other Texts, that though some of the primitive believers, were by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the persecution of those times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to great exigencies; yet the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the rest were very liberal in their contributions towards them. But it must be understood in the <hi>relative</hi> sence, concerning such as might be sty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led comparatively poor, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> such as are of a lower rank and meaner condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than others, and consequently had less temptation to corrupt and seduce them, than those that did more abound in these earthly things.</p>

                        <hi>FOurthly,</hi> Religion is the most proper means to promote the interest of <hi>Pleasure.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the handling of this, I shall first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to state the true nature of <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,</hi> and to shew what is the most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per notion of it. Now <hi>Pleasure</hi> doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in that satisfaction which we receive in the use and enjoyment of the things we possess. It is founded in a suitableness and congruity betwixt the faculty and the object. Those are called pleasant tastes and smells, which are apt to excite such a gentle motion as is agreeable to the nerves appointed for those functions. Now it cannot be denyed, but that <hi>beasts</hi> and <hi>insects</hi> may be said to be capable of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure proper to their kind, as well as <hi>men.</hi>
                        <pb n="345" facs="tcp:62179:183"/>
Only this must withall be granted, that the more noble and the more capacious the faculties and the objects are, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will the delights be that flow from the union of them. Upon which account all intellectual delights, do far exceed those that are sensual; and amongst persons that are capable of intellectual pleasures, their enjoyments must be greatest, whose fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties are most enlarged and most vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. 'Tis true indeed, men of vitiated and depraved faculties, though they are thereby disabled for passing a true judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the nature of things, being apt to mistake sowre for sweet; yet will it not thence follow, that they are incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of pleasure: They may have such pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar kinds of gusts, as will be able to find a satisfaction and sweetness in such things as appear nauseous and loathsome to others. And 'tis the congruity of things that is the foundation of pleasure. But then such persons are beholding to their ignorance and their delusion, to the distemper of their faculties, for their relish of these things. None but those that are <hi>foolish</hi> and <hi>deceived,</hi> and under the servitude of <hi>divers lusts,</hi> devoting themselves to such kind of things for pleasures. Supposing <note place="margin">Tit. 3. 3.</note> a man to have sound healthy faculties,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:62179:184"/>
such an one will not be able to find any true satisfaction and complacence, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in those things which have in them a natural goodness and rectitude. They must be regular objects that have in them a suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness to regular faculties.</p>
                     <p>This being premised by way of expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, I shall proceed to prove, That Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is the most proper means for the promoting of this interest; and this it doth

                     <p n="1">1. By Reason; Religion hath a <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> efficacy in promoting the interest of pleasure, teaching a man a chearful libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral use of the things he enjoys; how to <hi>make his soul enjoy good in his labour;</hi> how to sweeten and allay all the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and troubles of this life. Nor doth it restrain men from any such sensible plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, as are agreeable to reason, or our true interests. It only prohibits mistakes and excesses about them, teaches us so to regulate our selves in the use of them, that they may truly deserve the name of Pleasure; how to provide against that natural emptiness and vanity, which there is in all such things, whereby they are apt quickly to satiate and weary us; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this account it may be said to promote rather than hinder the interest of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
                     <p>As for the Pleasures of the Appetite, these abide no longer than till the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and conveniencies of nature are sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied;
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:62179:185"/>
and so far Religion doth allow of them. When our hunger and thirst is well appeased, all that follows after is but a faint kind of pleasure, if it be not rather to be styled satiety and a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</p>
                     <p>As for those kind of things, which we call by the name of sports and diversions, Religion doth likewise admit of a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate use of these; and what is beyond such a moderate use, doth rather tire men, than recreate them: It being as much the property of such things, to weary a man when he is once sufficiently refreshed by them, as it is to refresh him when he is wearied by other things.</p>
                     <p>We read indeed of <hi>the pleasures of sin;</hi> but besides that they are of a baser and grosser kind, 'tis said also, that they are <hi>but for a season, but for a moment,</hi> and <hi>the end of them is heaviness.</hi> The ways <note place="margin">Job 20. 5.</note> of sin may seem broad and pleasant, but they <hi>lead down to death, and take hold of hell.</hi> There are some vices that seem <note place="margin">Prov. 5. 5.</note> sweet to the palate, but do after <hi>fill the mouth with gravel.</hi> There are several sins <note place="margin">20. 17.</note> which have very specious and tempting appearances, which yet upon trial do <hi>bite like a serpent, and sting like an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</hi>

By what hath been said, it appears, that Religion is a natural cause of promoting these sensible pleasures; besides, that it affords delights incomparably beyond all these corporeal things, such as those who are <hi>strangers</hi> to Religion cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, and <hi>do not intermeddle with.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. But besides the Reasons to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, it may appear likewise from Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that the great pleasure of mens lives is from the goodness of them; such only being capable of a free and liberal enjoyment of what they possess, who know how to regulate themselves in the fruition of them, to avoid extremities on either hand, to prevent those mixtures of guilt and fear, which will imbitter all their enjoyments. Such persons only who have <hi>good consciences</hi> being capable of having a <hi>continual feast.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The great objection against this will be, from the difficulty of the duties of mortification, repentance, self-denial, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up the cross, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All which do im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply in them a repugnancy to our natures, and consequently an inconsistency with pleasure.</p>
                     <p>For answer to this it must be observed, That <hi>difficulty</hi> doth properly arise from a disproportion betwixt the power and
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:62179:186"/>
the work; as when a person of little strength is put to carry a great burden, when one of a mean capacity is put to answer an hard question in learning. Now supposing men to retain their vitious ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, it must be granted, to be as difficult for such to perform the duties of. Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or to forbear the acts of sin, as for a lame and impotent man to run, or for a man under a violent Feaver to be restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from drinking. But suppose these men cured of these maladies, and their facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to be rectified, then all this dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion and unsuitableness will vanish; and those things will become easie and delightful, which were before very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult and unpleasant. Now it is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of Religion, that it changes the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of men, making them <hi>new creatures. It puts off the old man, which is corrupt according to deceitful lusts, and puts on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.</hi> It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves our vitious habits, and endows the mind with other kind of inclinations and abilities. And though there should be some difficulties in the very passage from one state to another, yet this ought not to be objected as a prejudice against Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:62179:186"/>
because there are far greater dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties and pains to be undergone in the service and drudgery of impetuous lusts. The trouble of being cured, is not so great as that of being sick; nor is the trouble of being sober compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to that of being debauched and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate. That godly sorrow which is required as one of the first acts in the change of our condition, is always accompanied with secret pleasure: And as it is said of <hi>wicked men,</hi> that <hi>in the midst of laughter their heart is sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;</hi> so may it be said of <hi>good men,</hi> that <hi>in the midst of their sorrow their heart is joyful.</hi> And when the conditions of men are once changed, when they are passed over to another state, it will then prove as easie to them to observe the duties of Religion, as it was before to follow their own sinful inclinations. An evil tree doth not more naturally bring forth evil fruit, than a good tree doth bring forth good fruit.</p>
                     <p>As for that moroseness and sowre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of carriage which some men, who pretend to Religion, are noted for; This is not justly to be ascribed to their Religion, but to their want of
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:62179:187"/>
it: Joy and chearsulness being not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a priviledg, but a duty which Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion doth oblige men to, whereby they are to adorn their profession, and win over others to a love of it.</p>

This is one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est blessings which this world can afford, much to be preferred before Riches or Pleasures, or Life it self. <hi>A good name is rather to be chosen than great riches, and</hi>

                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 15.</note> 
                        <hi>my glorying void.</hi> And because it is a thing of so great excellency, therefore we do pay it, as the best service we can do, to God, and to his Deputies, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates and Parents. 'Tis by this that we are rendered useful and acceptable to others. And besides the advantage we have by it while we live, 'tis one of those things that will abide after us, when we are gone out of the world; and for
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:62179:188"/>
that reason a special regard is to be had to it. And the more wise and virtuous any man is, the more care will he take to transmit a grateful memory of himself to future times; and since he must be spoken of after his departure, to take care that he be well-spoken of, that his name may be as a precious oyntment, leaving a perfume behind it, that men may rise up at the mention of it and call him bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. Nor can any man despise honour, but he that doth either despair of it, or resolve against doing any thing that may deserve it.</p>
                     <p>Now honour is properly the esteem and good opinion which men have concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the person or the actions of another, together with such external expressions of respect as are suitable thereunto.</p>
                     <p>And I shall make it appear, that this kind of happiness doth depend upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion both

belong to any thing else. And that shame is the proper reward of vice, nor can it belong to any thing else.</p>
                     <p>The Scripture is very copious in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions to this purpose. Such as are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, are styled the <hi>excellent of the earth, Psal.</hi> 16. 3. and said to be <hi>more excellent than their neighbours. Prov.</hi> 17. 27.

                     <p>The <hi>Wise-man</hi> speaking of Rellgion, saith, that <hi>it shall be an ornament of grace</hi>

                        <hi>him.</hi> And certainly, he who is the King of Kings, must needs be the fountain of honour, and be able to dispose of it as he pleases.</p>
                     <p>And on the other side, Shame is in <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> said to be the proper reward and consequent of sin, especially in the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon.</hi> Religion is styled by the name of <hi>wisdom,</hi> and Sin by the name of <hi>folly.</hi> And the <hi>Wise-man</hi> having said, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 35, that <hi>the wise shall inherit glory,</hi> 'tis added, <hi>but shame shall be the promotion of fools:</hi> It shall be <hi>their promotion;</hi> the utmost that such persons shall ever attain to, will be but disgrace; when they are exalted and lifted up, it shall prove to their disparagement, to make their shame more conspicuous. And <hi>Prov.</hi> 13. 5. 'tis said, <hi>A wicked man is loathsome, and cometh to shame.</hi> The word translated <hi>loathsome,</hi> properly denotes such kind of persons to be as nauseous and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive to the judgments of others, as the most loathsome unsavoury things are to their tasts or smells. They are styled by the name of Wolves and Bears, Swine, Dogs, and Vipers, things both hurtful and hateful.</p>
                     <p>Men that are truly virtuous, have a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:62179:189"/>
paid them by all that know them. And on the other side, vicious men are despised. Not but that wicked persons may be inwardly honoured, by such as do not know them to be wicked; and on the other side, those that are good, may by others be esteemed and used, as being the rubbish and off-scouring of all things. But this is to be ascribed chiefly to their mistake and ignorance of them, whilst they look upon such persons as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the most dangerous pernicious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. But the generality of mankind have heretofore, and still do pay a reverence to any person whom they believe to be innocent and virtuous.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Religion is the <hi>natural</hi> cause of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Reputation, so far as such things are capable of any physical efficacy. This I shall endeavour to prove, both from Reason and Experience.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. By Reason. For the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of this, we are to take notice, that <hi>Honour</hi> may be considered under a twofold notion.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. According to the desert and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of it, in the person <hi>honoured.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. According to the acknowledgment or attribution of it, in the person <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="358" facs="tcp:62179:190"/>
Now Religion doth by a natural cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sality influence both these.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. According to the foundation of it, in the person <hi>honoured,</hi> which is true virtue and merit. I have shewed before, that the Essence of man may be said to consist in being religious, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this must be the rule and measure of a mans real worth; it must be our excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in that which makes us men, that must make us better men than others. All other things have some kind of standard, by which the natural goodness of them is to be measured; so is it with men like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise. And this is usually from their sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableness to that chief end they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed for. <hi>Quae conditio rerum, eadem &amp; hominum est; navis bona dicitur, non quae pretiosis coloribus picta est,</hi> &amp;c. (saith <hi>Seneca)</hi> 
                        <q>We do not therefore esteem a <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Epist.</hi> 76.</note> 
                           <hi>Ship</hi> to be good, because it is curiously painted and gilded, or carved and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay'd but because 'tis fitted for all the purposes of Navigation, which is the proper end of a Ship.</q> Nor do we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore count a Sword to be good, because it hath a rich Hilt and an embroidered Scabbard but because it is sit for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per use of a Sword, which is to cut, <hi>&amp;c. In homine quoque nihil ad rem pertinet,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:62179:190"/>
quantum aret, quantum foeneret, a quàm multis salutetur, sed quàm bonus sit.</hi> It should be so likewise in our esteem of men, who are not so much to be valued by the grandeur of their Estates or Titles, as by their inward goodness. The true stamp of Nobility is upon the minds of men, and doth consist in such virtuous habits, as will enable a man for worthy designs and actions; when the image of God, who is the rule of excellency and the fountain of honour, is in any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure restored upon it.</p>
                     <p>Every man is endowed with a natural principle, inclining him to a state of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, and hath in some measure both an ability to judg of, and a freedom and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty for applying himself unto, those du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which are the proper means for the promoting of this end: Nor is he upon any other account to be justly praised or blamed, but according to the right or wrong use of this natural liberty. And therefore as such a man doth find either in himself or others, a constant and firm resolution to make a right use of this, so should he proportion his esteem accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, preferring this inward greatness, this rectitude of mind, whereby a man is resolved in every condition, to do that
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:62179:191"/>
which shall appear to be his duty, before any kind of external greatness whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
                     <p>There is a respect and honour due to all kind of virtues whatsoever, as render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men amiable and lovely. But amongst the rest, there are two, which are by ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral consent esteemed venerable, and such as do greatly advance the reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of those who are endowed with them; namely,
<list>
                           <item>Wisdom,</item>
                           <item>Courage.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>Because they have a more intrinsick rise, and do less depend upon external advantages, but seem rather to be rooted in the inward frame and temper of our minds; and withall are most beneficial both to our selves and others: The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer signifying a man to have those <hi>intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual</hi> abilities which are proper to his kind, whereby the humane nature is to be distinguished from other things: The other, because it argues a rectitude in the <hi>will,</hi> and a power to subdue the passion of fear, which is most natural to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent state of infirmity; and withall doth support a man against difficulties, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:62179:191"/>
him for those two great services, of <hi>doing</hi> and <hi>suffering</hi> as he ought. And for this reason, the vices that are opposite to these, are amongst all others counted the most shameful; there being no greater re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to be cast upon any one, than to be esteemed a Fool or a Coward.</p>
                     <p>Now a man that is irreligious cannot justly pretend to either of these virtues.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. For <hi>Wisdom.</hi> This is so essential to Religion, that in the Scripture-phrase they both go under the same <hi>name.</hi> And there is very good reason, why it should be so; because there is such an intimate agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between the <hi>natures</hi> of them. The <hi>Philosopher</hi> doth define Wisdom to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in an ability and inclination, to make choice of right <hi>means</hi> in the prosecution of our true <hi>end.</hi> And nothing can enable a man for this but Religion, both as to the <hi>subordinate</hi> end of <hi>temporal</hi> happiness in this world, and chiefly with respect to that great and <hi>supreme</hi> end of <hi>eternal</hi> happiness in the world to come.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And then for <hi>Courage.</hi> 'Tis not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible for a man to be truly valiant, unless he be withall truly religious: He may be bold and daring, and able in a fearless manner to rush upon any danger; but then he must stifle his reason from consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:62179:192"/>
what the consequences of things may be, what shall become of him here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, if he should miscarry: There be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no man whatsoever so totally free from the apprehensions of a future state, but that when he is serious and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, he must be startled with doubts and fears concerning it: So that there cannot be any rational, sedate, delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate courage, but only in such as have good hopes of a better estate in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world; And 'tis Religion only that can enable a man for this.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Honour considered, according to the acknowledgment or attribution of it in the persons <hi>Honouring;</hi> which is the external form, or as the body of honour, being much in the power of others. And this may be distinguished into these two kinds,

                           <item>Inward,</item>

                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Inward,</hi> Honouring is properly an act of the understanding, in passing judgment upon the nature of things: When we do in our minds, own and acknowledg the real worth or virtue of a thing or person. And every one who
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:62179:192"/>
will act rationally, not miscalling good evil, and evil good, must proportion his esteem of things, according to the real value of them. Nor is it in any mans power, so far to offer violence to his own faculties, as to believe any thing against evidence; to esteem that man to be either worthy or unworthy, whom he knows to be otherwise. He may call him and use him as he pleases, and he may be willing to entertain prejudices, either for or against him; And in this sense, <hi>Honor est in honorante:</hi> But he cannot inwardly think or believe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than according to his evidence. For men of no real worth to expect this inward honour from others, as it is very <hi>unequal, requiring brick without straw;</hi> and very <hi>unlawful,</hi> It being as well a mans duty <hi>to contemn a vile person, as to honour those that fear the Lord;</hi> so neither is it <hi>possible,</hi> because men must necessarily judge according to the most prevailing evidence; nor can they esteem such a one to be worthy whom they know to be otherwise, any more than they can believe that to be white and streight which they see to be black and crooked.</p>

                        <pb n="364" facs="tcp:62179:193"/>
There are indeed some other things that do commonly go under this name, as the several degrees of Nobility, Titles, and Places of dignity, which are usually called by this name of honour; but these things (as they are abstracted from Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracy) being wholly extrinsecal, have no more due to them, but a mere ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal respect: They may challenge from us that we should give them their due Titles, and demean our selves towards them with that observance and ceremony which becomes their quality: But then as for that inward esteem and valuation of our minds belonging to good men; such persons can challenge no greater share of this, than according as their real me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and virtue shall require. The Royal stamp upon any kind of Metal may be sufficient to give it an extrinsick value, and to determine the rate at which it is to pass amongst Coyns; but it cannot give an intrinsick value, or make that which is but Brass to be Gold.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true indeed there are some Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and particular Relations of men, to which an inward veneration is due, though the persons themselves should not be virtuous; namely <hi>Magistrates,</hi> and <hi>Ministers,</hi> and <hi>Parents,</hi> and <hi>Benefactors;</hi>
                        <pb n="365" facs="tcp:62179:193"/>
who having somewhat of a Divine stamp and impress, may therefore challenge from us, that we should demean our selves towards them, both with such an <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> respect as becomes their <hi>places,</hi> and with such an <hi>inward</hi> respect too, as may be suitable to that <hi>image</hi> which they bear; to our <hi>dependance</hi> upon them, and <hi>obligations</hi> to them. But then we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be obliged to think such persons good men, unless we have some evidence to believe them to be so, or at least, not to be otherwise; so that they are behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to something extrinsecal to their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, namely to their Callings and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, for that honour which is paid to them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Outward</hi> Honouring is, when men do by their words or actions testify that esteem and respect which they have for the worth of others. And this indeed may be truely said to be in the power of others, because men have a greater command over their words and actions, than they have over their belief. Now all men that are truely virtuous and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, will be ready to give unto eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one his due honour; and such are the best judges of it. Upon which account <hi>Tully</hi> defines true honour to be <hi>consen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiens <note place="margin">

laus bonorum,</hi> the concurrent ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of good men; such only being fit to give true praise, who are them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves praise-worthy.</p>
                     <p>As for vitious and irreligious persons, 'tis not to be expected that they should be forward to commend that which is opposite to them. But then 'tis to be considered, that these are no competent judges of such matters: And for a man to resent deeply the contempt of unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy persons, were overmuch to honour them, as if their esteem could add any thing to his reputation.</p>
                     <p>And yet, even these persons cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void having an inward veneration for goodness and religion, which is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why they are so forward to dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it, to disguise themselves under the shew of it. Men do not use to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit common stones and metals, but such as are precious, Jewels and Gold; Nor would any one take the pains to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit being Religious, if he did not think it a matter of some value, and a means to procure esteem from others. And when such men do revile and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute any one for being religious, yet is there such a natural veneration belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the thing it self, as makes them
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:62179:194"/>
to disguise it under the name of Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisy, Heresy, Superstition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereby they may justify themselves in their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing of it.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. But this is only general discourse, and in the notion. The best argument to this purpose would be from <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;</hi> by which I mean that practical knowledg, which every man may attain by his own observation of the usual course of things in the world. And by this it will appear, that no kind of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons have been more highly reverenced in the hearts and consciences of others, than those that have been most eminent for their virtue and religion; which hath been always true, both with respect to publick communities, and private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. For <hi>Nations.</hi> If we consult the Histories of former times, we shall find that saying of <hi>Solomon</hi> constantly verify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That <hi>Righteousness doth exalt a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Prov. 14. 34.</note> 
                        <hi>but sin doth prove a reproach to it.</hi> And more especially the sin of Irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness and Prophaneness; As this doth increase in any nation, so must the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Reputation of that nation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease. The <hi>Roman</hi> Empire was then at the highest, as to its name and greatness,
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:62179:195"/>
when it was so as to its virtue; when they were most punctual in observing the Rites of their Religion (though that were a false way of worship) most He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roical in their Justice, courage, fidelity, gratitude; then it was that they deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to govern the world, and to be had in greatest honour above all other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And not only <hi>Cicero,</hi> and <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius,</hi> two Heathen Writers, who, upon that account, might be thought more partial; But St. <hi>Austin</hi> also and <hi>Lactan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> two of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> do ascribe the flourishing of that Empire, when it was at its height, to the Religion and Piety and virtue of those times; and as they did afterwards degenerate from this, so did they decline likewise in their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and honour.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Thus also hath it been with <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular persons;</hi> Amongst the <hi>Heathen,</hi> what Elogies do we find in the honour of <hi>Socrates, Aristides, Cato, Epictetus?</hi> The last of whom, though but a poor slave, had yet such a veneration paid to his memory, that his earthen lamp by which he was wont to study, was, after his death, sold for Three thousand Drachms.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="369" facs="tcp:62179:195"/>
Nor was it otherwise amongst the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians;</hi> The <hi>Apostles</hi> were but poor Fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ermen, illiterate Mechanicks; many of the <hi>Martyrs</hi> were but of mean condition, much opposed and persecuted in the world; and yet these men, during the time of their lives, were highly reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced amongst those that knew them; and since their deaths, what can be more glorious than that renown which they have amongst men, when the greatest Kings and Princes will not mention their names without reverence, when whole Nations are willing to set apart, and to observe solemn days and Festivals in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of their memories?</p>
                     <p>And as it hath always been thus for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, so I appeal to every man's breast, whether it be not so now. Let them but examine what their inclinations are towards such persons whom they believe to be truly virtuous; not only to such among them, as are their particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance and friends; but likewise to strangers, nay to very enemies, whether they do not esteem and love them and will-well to them.</p>
                     <p>It cannot be denyed, but that there are too many in the world, who propose to themselves such ways and courses for
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:62179:196"/>
the promoting of their <hi>honour</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, as are quite opposite to that which I have now been discoursing of; namely, prophaneness and contempt of Religion, despising that which other men stand in awe of; by which they think to get the reputation of <hi>Wit</hi> and <hi>Courage;</hi> of <hi>Wit,</hi> by pretending to penetrate more deeply into the nature of things, and to understand them better than others do; not to be so easily imposed upon, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther credulous people are: Of <hi>Courage,</hi> by not being so easily scared at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of danger at a distance.</p>
                     <p>But the plain truth is, such persons do hereby prove themselves to be both <hi>Fools</hi> and <hi>Cowards.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fools;</hi> In mistaking their great interest, in making choice of such means, as can never promote the end they design. There being no kind of men that are more exposed (whatsoever they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves may think of it) than those that seek for credit by despising of Religion. <hi>Fools,</hi> in venturing their <hi>future estates</hi> and their <hi>souls</hi> upon such hazards, as all mankind would cry-out-upon, for the most palpable folly and madness, if they should do the like towards their <hi>Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral estates,</hi> or their Bodies.</p>

                        <hi>Cowards;</hi> In being more afraid of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle dangers, because they are <hi>present,</hi> than of greater, because they are <hi>future,</hi> and at a distance. As that Souldier, who doth more dread the present danger of fighting, when he is obliged to it, than the future danger of suffering by <hi>Martial</hi> law for running away, may justly be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed a notorious coward; so may that man, who is more afraid of a <hi>present</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience, by incurring the prejudice and displeasure of his loose companions, to whom he would be acceptable, than of a <hi>future</hi> mischief from the judgment of God. No man will esteem another to be truely valiant, because he is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to do such vile unworthy things as will expose him to the displeasure and punishment of the Civil Magistrate; much less should he be so accounted, for daring to do such things, as will in the issue expose him to the Divine vengeance.</p>

1. <hi>Morally;</hi> as these things are blessings and priviledges, so do they belong to Religion as the proper reward of it. Those men only being fit to have free and large minds, and refined faculties, who are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to improve them to the best use and advantage. To this purpose there are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral expressions in <hi>Scripture: A good un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding have all they that do his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments. Thou through thy command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments hast made me wiser than mine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. He that doth the will of God shall know it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Naturally,</hi> as these things are <hi>duties,</hi> so are they the proper effects of virtue.</p>
                     <p>The generality of the <hi>Heathen</hi> Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers have agreed in this, that sin is the natural cause of debasing the soul, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mersing it into a state of sensuality and darkness, deriving such an impotence and deformity upon the mind, as the most loathsome diseases do upon the body. And therefore it must be Religion and virtue, on the other side, that must en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten and enlarge the mind, and restore it from the degeneracy of its lapsed estate, renewing upon us the image of our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, adorning us with those beauties of holiness, which belong to <hi>the hidden man of the heart.</hi> 'Tis the proper work of
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:62179:198"/>
Religion, to frame the mind to the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est conformity unto the nature of God; upon which account it is said in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to consist in <hi>a participation of the</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>Divine nature.</hi> Other things may be said to have some remote resemblance to the Deity; but man only amongst the visible creatures, is capable of those more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate communications from him, by Religion: And all kind of perfection is to be measured by its nearness or remote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to the first and chief pattern of all perfection.</p>
                     <p>As all kind of vice doth go under the name of <hi>impotence,</hi> so Religion is described to be <hi>the spirit of power, and of a sound mind.</hi> Because it doth establish in a man a just empire over himself, over all those blind powers and passions which of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves are apt to raise tumults and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions against the dominion of Reason. That which health is to the body, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the outward senses are enabled to make a true judgment of things, that is virtue to the mind, whereby the inward facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties must be fitted and disposed to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern betwixt things that differ, which those who are under the power of vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous habits are not able to do.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="375" facs="tcp:62179:198"/>
But to speak more particularly, Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion doth,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Enlarge the understanding,</hi> enabling it to see beyond the narrow bounds of sense and time, to behold things that are invisible; God being in the intellectual world, as the Sun is in the sensible world; and as natural blindness doth disable men from seeing the one, so will spiritual blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness for the other.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It doth <hi>exalt and regulate the will,</hi> to a desire after, and acquiescence in such things as will promote the perfection of our natures, and consequently will beget in the mind, the truest liberty, ingenuity, generosity, which are altogether incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with the servitude of lusts and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It doth <hi>reduce the passions,</hi> unto a due subordination to the superior facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; restraining the violence and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuousness of them, from whence the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est part of the trouble and disquiet of mens lives doth proceed. As he that is of a healthy constitution, can endure heat and cold and labour with little or no prejudice to himself; so can one of a virtuous mind undergo various conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons without receiving any hurt from them. Such an one is not lifted up by prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:62179:199"/>
nor dejected by adversity: He is not a servant to anger, fear, envy, malice, which are the great occasions of disturbing our inward peace and quiet.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The second thing wherein the well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of our minds doth consist, is peace, tranquillity, joy, confidence, in oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to inward disquiet, anxiety, grief, fear, diffidence.

                     <p n="1">1. Religion doth oblige men to joy and peace and confidence.

                     <p>The <hi>Sicilian</hi> Tyrants, who were of old famous for inventing engines of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as that of <hi>Phalaris</hi> his Bull, were not able to find out any kind of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the body, equal to that which some of these vices do occasion to the mind.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And as Religion doth oblige us to, so likewise doth it enable us for this kind of happiness, and that upon a two-fold account.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. From the general nature of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Virtue considered in it self.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. From the most natural effects and consequences of it.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. From the general nature of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on considered in it self. All kind of vertues containing in their very essence, these kind of inward felicities, either For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally or Virtually: The very foundation
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:62179:200"/>
of happiness and misery, reward and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, being laid in the very nature of these things themselves. That natural appetite, whereby men are carried out after a state of happiness, is for the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it so universal and radical, so closely fixed to our first principles; and for the degree of it so ardent and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous, that 'tis not possible for men to be disappointed in it, without a very quick sensation, and some proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble trouble for it. The more eager men are in their desires, the more sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible must they be of gain or loss. Now all such courses as have a natural ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to the satisfying of this appetite, are upon that account parts of our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness. And on the other side, those which are cross to it, must needs make us miserable. And if it be so (as I have already proved) that our happiness must consist in such a similitude and resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance to the supreme good as we are capable of; it must hence follow, that Religion is formally happiness. He that lives under the power of Godlike dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions in his mind, and doth according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exercise them in the course of his life, may be said <hi>eo nomine</hi> to be a happy man: Holiness and Happiness being but
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:62179:201"/>
two distinct names for the same thing. I shewed before that the true nature of pleasure was founded in a suitableness be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the faculty and the object: From whence it will follow, that reasonable actions have in them a suitableness to reasonable minds; And the more virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and religious any man is, the more delight must such a man take in such kind of actions. That man who hath a just sense of his own impotent dependent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and how much it is for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of the world, and the good of all humane affairs, that there is a supreme Governour, who is infinitely wise, and powerful, and gracious, and how reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able it is that men should demean them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves towards him suitably to this belief: He that is convinced how necessary it is for the promoting his own private, as well as the publick wellfare, that men be forward to do all good offices of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice and friendship towards one another: I say, he that is under this conviction, must needs find much satisfaction and pleasure in such kind of actions. As for <hi>first Table</hi> duties which consist in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with God, communion with him, in meditating upon his wisdom, goodness, power, in affiance, love, reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence;
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:62179:201"/>
if these were not acts of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est pleasure, they would never have been appointed for the happiness of our fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture state in heaven. And as for <hi>second Table</hi> duties, what greater pleasure and satisfaction can there be to a generous mind, than to do worthy things, to be employed about acts of justice and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and beneficence, to promote publick peace and good-will amongst men? Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and drinking is not a more proper satisfaction to those natural appetites of hunger and thirst, than the doing of good is to the rational inclinations of a good man. As all light, and love, and joy are from above, from the father of lights; so all darkness, sorrow, fear, disquiet, must be from below, from the Prince of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. Wicked men are well compared to the troubled sea, which cannot rest, but by reason of its being tossed to and fro <note place="margin">Isa. 57.</note> by contrary winds, is still casting up mire and dirt. He that lives under the servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of lusts and passions, must always be in an unquiet restless condition; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause such masters can never be satisfied in any one service they employ us about; besides the interfering and contrariety of those employments which they will exact from us. Vice is multiform, <hi>scelera dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</hi>
                        <pb n="382" facs="tcp:62179:202"/>
and therefore must they needs be inconsistent with rest and quiet. One prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal requisite to a state of serenity of mind, doth consist in an uniform agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment about that chief end which we are to pursue, together with the means con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to it; whereas they that have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and contrary things in design, must needs be distracted about them. The soul that cannot fix it self upon the enjoyment of God, who is the only all-sufficient Good, and consequently the only center of Rest, must be like those disconsolate spirits, which our Saviour speaks of, who being <note place="margin">Mat. 12.</note> cast out of their habitations, were put to wander up and down through desart places, seeking rest, but finding none.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. From the most natural effects and consequences of Religion, in respect of that inward confidence, peace, joy, which must follow the conscience of well-doing; insomuch, that there is not any kind of tree which doth more naturally produce its proper fruits, than the habits of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue do bring forth joy and serenity in the mind. When a man shall sit down and take a serious review of what he hathdone, and finds it to be most agreeable both to his duty and interest, from hence there must needs arise an inward satisfaction of
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:62179:202"/>
mind. And on the other side, a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain doth not more naturally send out waters, than vice doth punishment and misery. Nor is this any meer notion or fancy, which some severe melancholy Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines would impose upon the world; but it is most agreeable to those natural sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents which the very <hi>Heathen</hi> have had and do frequently mention: <hi>Seneca</hi> in particular; <hi>Res severa est verum gaudium; unde sit, interrogas? dicam, ex bona con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientia, ex honestis conciliis, ex rectis actionibus.</hi> All solid comfort must arise from a good conscience, and honest acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                     <p>I appeal to the experience of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering men, whether this doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to them, that the generality of those who live most pleasantly in the world, are the most religious and virtuous part of mankind; such as know how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate themselves in the fruition of what they have, how to avoid the extremities on either hand, to prevent those mixtures of guilt and fear, which are apt to sowre and imbitter all our enjoyments? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lawful pleasures, which a man may reflect upon without any sense of guilt, be not much to be preferred before o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? Whether those intellectual delights
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:62179:203"/>
that flow from the conscience of well-doing, be not much better than any sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful sensual pleasure? Whether the doing of any worthy action, such as all good men must think well of and commend, do not afford a more solid lasting pleasure than can be had from any sensible enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? Whether any thing can be more suitable, and consequently delightful to a generous mind, than an opportunity of being grateful to those by whom a man hath been obliged; the making of an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple return for the favours he hath received? Whether that noble way of conquest, <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming evil with good,</hi> surprizing an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my by kindness, when we have it in our power to be severe towards him, be not a far greater pleasure than that which is by some counted the sweetest of all other things, <hi>Revenge?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Religion doth likewise advance the soul to an holy confidence, concerning the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine favour and good-will towards us. <hi>If our hearts condemn us not, we have confidence towards God.</hi> A good consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will set us above all those fears and doubts and cares, whereby the lives of men are rendered uncomfortable. When in decrepit age a man cannot find comfort in other things, <hi>when the grinders shall
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:62179:203"/>
be few, and appetite cease,</hi> then will this be <hi>a continual feast.</hi> The most rational, solid, sublime, complete, durable delights, of all others, do flow from the conscience of well-doing. 'Tis a chief part this, of that heaven which we enjoy upon earth, and 'tis likewise a principal part of that happiness which we hope to enjoy in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Next to the beatifical vision and fruition of God, is the happiness of a good conscience, and next to that the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of Saints and Angels.</p>
                     <p>Whereas on the other side, he that lives under the sense of guilt, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciousness of his obligation to punishment, must needs be destitute of all inward peace and comfort: Such an one can have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to support him, with patience, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a state of affliction in this world, nor can he have any rational grounds to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a better condition hereafter; and therefore must needs have very dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful apprehensions of dying, and <hi>be all his life time subject to bondage through the fear of death.</hi> And that man must needs be very miserable, who can neither have true <hi>joy in life,</hi> nor any <hi>hope in death.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This the <hi>Heathen</hi> Philosophers have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, That there is always a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret dread which doth accompany guilt.
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:62179:204"/>
So <hi>Seneca</hi> in particular, speaking of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, he saith, <hi>tantùm metuunt quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tùm</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">

                        <hi>nocent,</hi> that such men must have fears proportionable to their guilt. And a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle after, <hi>dat paenas quisquis expect at, quis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis autem meruit expect at;</hi> those men do really suffer punishment, who live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the expectation of it, and whoever doth any thing to deserve it must needs expect it. 'Tis not easie to express the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which those men undergo,

                     </p>
                     <p>'Tis the unsupportableness of this, that many times doth cause men in the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their souls, to chuse strangling and death rather than life. The <hi>Heathens</hi> do set forth such a mans condition, by the fiction of <hi>Furies</hi> continually haunting and scourging him: But <hi>Zophar</hi> doth better describe it, where he saith, <hi>Terrors are</hi>

Though some men are so hardened a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the sense of guilt, as to go on in their sinful courses, without feeling any of this remorse for them; yet is their peace so far from being a priviledg, that it doth render their condition more despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, because it supposes them to have a <hi>reprobate mind,</hi> and such a stupidity up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 28 Eph. 4. 18, 19. 1 Tim. 4. 2.</note> their consciences, as makes them <hi>past feeling,</hi> being <hi>seared as it were with an hot iron.</hi> Which though it may preserve them from those present lashes which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are tormented with, yet doth it ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue their conditions to be more remedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less and desperate.

                     <p>I shall speak but briefly to this subject, because 'tis scarce possible for any man to be so strangely infatuated, so wholly lost to common Reason as to believe, that vicious courses, despising of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, walking contrary to God, can be the means to entitle him to this future happiness, any more than contempt and hatred of any one, is a proper means to procure his favour.</p>

                     <p>In brief; That Salvation and Glory, which the Christian Religion doth so clearly propose to us, is, as to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and essence of it, but the very same thing with Religion; consisting in such a conformity of our minds to the nature of God, whereby we are made capable of the fruition of him in Heaven.

                     <p>I have now dispatcht what I intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this Discourse, namely to prove the Reasonableness and Credibility of the Principles of Natural Religion; which I have made appear to be in themselves of so great evidence, that every one, who will not do violence to his own facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, must believe and assent unto them.

it were not possible for us to contrive any rules more advantageous to our own interest, than those which Religion doth propose, and require us to observe, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pain of everlasting damnation, and <hi>in hope of eternal life which God that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not lye hath promised,</hi> to all those <hi>who by patient continuance in well-doing, seek for glory and honour and immortality.</hi>

                           <hi>The Conclusion of the whole, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the excellency of the</hi> Christian Religion, <hi>and the advantages of it, both as to the</hi> knowledg <hi>and</hi> practice <hi>of our duty, above the meer</hi> light of Nature.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>I Have now at large considered the Credibility of the <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Religion,</hi> and our obligation to the several <hi>Duties</hi> resulting from those <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</hi> The purpose of all which is to shew how firm and deep a foundation Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion hath in the Nature and Reason of Mankind: But not in the least to dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate from the necessity and usefulness of <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi> or to extenuate the great blessing and benefit of the <hi>Christian Religion;</hi> but rather to prepare and make way for the entertainment of that <hi>Doctrine</hi> which is so agreeable to the clearest di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of Natural light. For notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all that hath been said of <hi>Natural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> it cannot be denyed, but that in
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:62179:208"/>
this dark and degenerate state into which Mankind is sunk, there is great want of a clearer light to discover our duty to us with greater certainty, and to put it beyond all doubt and dispute what is the good and acceptable Will of God; and of a more powerful encouragement to the practice of our duty, by the promise of a supernatural assistance, and by the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of a great and eternal reward. And all these defects are fully supplied, by that clear and perfect <hi>Revelation</hi> which God hath made to the World by our blessed <hi>Saviour.</hi> And although, before God was pleased to make this Revelation of his Will to mankind, men were obliged to the practice of <hi>moral duties</hi> by the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> and as the <hi>Apostle</hi> speaks, <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 2. 14, 15.</note> 
                        <hi>not the Law were a Law to themselves, shewing the effect of the Law written upon their hearts;</hi> yet now that God hath in so much mercy revealed his Will so plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to mankind, it is not enough for us who enjoy this <hi>Revelation,</hi> to perform those moral duties which are of natural obligation, unless we also do them in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to <hi>Christ</hi> as our Lord and Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver. As we are <hi>Christians, whatever we do in word or deed, we must do all in</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Col. 3. 17.</note> 
                        <hi>the name of the Lord Jesus;</hi> and by him
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:62179:209"/>
alone expect to find acceptance with God.</p>
                     <p>How far the Moral virtues of meer <hi>Heathens,</hi> who walk answerable to the light they have, may be approved of God, I shall not now dispute. Only thus much seems clear in the general, That the Law of Nature being implanted in the hearts of men by God himself, must therefore be esteemed to be as much his Law, as any positive Institution whatsoever: And consequently, conformity to it must in its kind, <hi>in genere morum,</hi> be acceptable to him. God loves the societies of mankind, and because of the necessity of justice, and virtue, and probity to the preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of humane society, therefore he doth generally give a blessing and success to honest and good enterprizes, and blasts the contrary with signal judgments and marks of his displeasure. But we cannot from these outward dispensations infer any thing certainly concerning such mens eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal conditions.</p>
                     <p>Some of the <hi>Fathers</hi> indeed, as <hi>Justin Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr,</hi> and <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> and <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom,</hi> have delivered their judgments for the salvation of such <hi>Heathens</hi> as live ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the light of Nature: But the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral stream of the rest is for the contrary
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:62179:209"/>
opinion. I shall not now enquire into the particular grounds and reasons of this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference. It may suffice to say in general, that the <hi>goodness</hi> and <hi>mercy</hi> of God, as well as <hi>his judgments are a great deep;</hi> that <hi>he will have mercy on whom he will have mercy;</hi> and that when God hath not thought fit to tell <hi>us</hi> how he will be pleased to deal with such persons, it is not sit for us to tell <hi>Him</hi> how he ought to deal with them. Only of this we are sufficiently assured, that in all ages and places of the world, all that are saved are saved by the mercy of God, and by the merits of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> who is the Lamb slain from the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world; the <hi>Scripture</hi> having expresly told us, that <hi>there is no salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in any other; for there is none other Name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved.</hi> To be sure, there is no reason for any man, who lives under the dispensation of the Gospel, to expect that he <hi>shall escape,</hi> if he <hi>neglect so great salvation.</hi> This is the tenour of that Doctrine of the Gospel, which <hi>Christ</hi> immediately upon his resurrection doth commissionate his Disciples to preach; <hi>Mark 16. 16. He that believeth shall be saved, but he that believeth not shall be damned.</hi> And <hi>Joh:</hi> 3. 18. <hi>He that believeth
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:62179:210"/>
not, is condemned already.</hi> And present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it follows, <hi>This is the condemnation,</hi> &amp;c. And again <hi>Joh. 7. This is life eternal, to know thee the only true God, and him whom thou hast sent, Jesus Christ.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now that to <hi>us,</hi> to whom the Christian Doctrine is revealed and proposed, the belief and practice of it is the only way wherein we can hope to be accepted, I shall endeavour to make out by these two arguments:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. From the Evidence we have of its Divine Authority.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. From the Excellency of the things contained in it; which are the two chief grounds of our obligation to it.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. From that <hi>Evidence</hi> which we have for the Divine authority of this Doctrine, above any other. It seems to be a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Nature, to which all Nations have consented, That God himself should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe the way of his own worship. All kind of inventions whatsoever, that have been any way useful to humane life, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially such kind of Laws as concern Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil or Ecclesiastical associations of men, have upon the first discovery of them been still ascribed to the <hi>Deity.</hi> As if the <hi>Authors</hi> of them must needs have been first illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated with some ray of Divinity. Nor
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:62179:210"/>
is it probable, that ever any Nation should, with any degree of zeal, embrace the respective Ceremonies of their Religion, unless they had first esteemed them to have proceeded from Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>Upon this account was it that <hi>Lycur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi> and <hi>Numa Pompilius,</hi> and <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and the rest of those kind of Founders of Nations and Religions, when they would obtain a reverence and devotion to the things they were to establish, they were fain to pretend at least to Divine Revelation. Which proceeding of theirs, though it did really abuse the people with gross delusions, yet was it founded upon this common Principle, that none can think aright of God, much less serve him in an acceptable manner, unless they are first instructed by him in the true way of doing it.</p>
                     <p>Now that the Doctrine of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is thus derived to us by Divine Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, we have as clear and convincing evidence, as things of that nature are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of.</p>
                     <p>As for the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> that hath by the general consent of learned men, all the marks of purest Antiquity; there being nothing in the world which in this
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:62179:211"/>
respect is equal to it, or which may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be compared with it. All other the most ancient monuments of Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty coming short of it by many Ages. It was written in the first and most ancient Language; from which the very Alpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bets and Letters of all other Languages (in the opinion of the most learned <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, Plutarch, Pliny, Tacitus, Lucan,</hi> &amp;c.) were derived. The very number and order of Letters most generally used in all kind of <hi>Alphabets,</hi> being very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper and unnatural; which it is not likely men of several nations would have all agreed upon, were it not barely upon this reason, that they were taken up by imitation, and so did retain the errors and imperfections of that first original from whence they were derived.</p>
                     <p>This Book contains as the most anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, so the most exact story of the world, The propagation of men, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spersing of families into the several parts of the earth; as I shewed before.</p>
                     <p>And though this Book were written in several ages and places, by several per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; yet doth the Doctrine of it accord together, with a most excellent harmony, without any dissonance or inconsisten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="401" facs="tcp:62179:211"/>
And for the manner of delivering the things contained in it, 'tis so solemn, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend and majestick, so exactly suited to the nature of things, as may justly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke our wonder and acknowledgment of its Divine original. Insomuch that <hi>Longinus,</hi> a great master of eloquence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the <hi>Heathens,</hi> hath observed the <hi>decorum</hi> and majesty which <hi>Moses</hi> useth in describing the Creation, in those words, <hi>God said, Let there be Light, and there was Light.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And as for the <hi>New Testament.</hi> Those various correspondencies, which it bears to the chief things of the Old Testament, may sufficiently evidence that mutual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, dependance and affinity which there is betwixt them. That in such an Age there was such a man as <hi>Christ,</hi> who preached such a doctrine, wrought many miracles, suffered an ignominious death, and was afterwards worshipped as God, having abundance of disciples and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, at first chiefly amongst the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, but a while after, amongst several of the most wise and learned men; who in a short space of time did propagate their belief and doctrine into the most remote parts of the world: I say, all this is for the truth of the matter of fact, not
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:62179:212"/>
so much as doubted or called into que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, by <hi>Julian,</hi> or <hi>Celsus,</hi> or the <hi>Jews</hi> themselves, or any other of the most a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed enemies of Christianity. But we have it by as good certainty as any ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional man can wish or hope for, that is, by Universal Testimony, as well of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies as friends.</p>
                     <p>And if these things were so, as to the matter of fact, the common principles of nature will assure us, that 'tis not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with the nature of the Deity, his Truth, Wisdom or Justice, to work such miracles in confirmation of a Lye or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posture.</p>
                     <p>Nor can it be reasonably objected. That these miracles are now ceased; and we have not any such extraordinary way to confirm the truth of our Religion: 'Tis sufficient that they were upon the first plantation of it, when men were to be instituted and confirmed in that new Doctrine. And there may be as much of the wisdom of Providence in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing them now, as in working them then. It being not reasonable to think that the universal Laws of Nature by which things are to be regularly guided in their natural course, should frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or upon every little occasion be vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated or disordered.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="403" facs="tcp:62179:212"/>
To which may be added <hi>that</hi> wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful way whereby this Religion hath been propagated in the world, with much sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity and infirmity in the first publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of it; without arms, or faction, or favour of great men, or the perswasions of <hi>Philosophers</hi> or <hi>Orators;</hi> only by a naked proposal of plain evident Truth, with a firm resolution of suffering and dying for it, by which it hath subdued all kind of persecutions and oppositions, and surmounted whatever discouragement or resistance could be laid in its way, or made against it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. From the <hi>Excellency</hi> of the things contained in it, both in respect of the
<list>
                           <item>
                              <hi>End</hi> proposed,</item>
                           <item>
                              <hi>Means</hi> for the attaining of it.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. From the <hi>End</hi> it proposes, the chief reward which it sets before us, namely, the eternal vision and fruition of God. Which is so excellent in it self, and so suitable to a rational Being, as no other Religion or Profession whatsoever, hath thought of, or so expresly insisted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p>Some of the learned <hi>Heathen</hi> have pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the happiness of Man in the external
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:62179:213"/>
sensual delights of this world; I mean the <hi>Epicureans,</hi> who though in other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects they were persons of many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and sublime speculations, yet because of their gross error in this kind, they have been in all ages looked upon with a kind of execration and abhorrency, not only amongst the <hi>vulgar,</hi> but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise amongst the learneder sort of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers.</hi> 'Tis an opinion this, so very gross and ignoble, as cannot be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently dispised. It doth debase the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of man, and all the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in him, that are sublime and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, extinguishing the very seeds of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and piety, and virtue, affording no room for actions or endeavours, that are truely great and noble; being alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unworthy of the nature of Man, and doth reduce us to the condition of Beasts.</p>
                     <p>Others of the wiser <hi>Heathen,</hi> have spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken sometimes doubtfully concerning a future estate, and therefore have placed the reward of virtue, in the doing of virtuous things. <hi>Virtus est sibi praemium.</hi> Wherein though there be much of truth, yet it doth not afford encouragement e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, for the vast desires of a rational soul.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="405" facs="tcp:62179:213"/>
Others who have owned a state after this life, have placed the Happiness of it in gross and sensual pleasures, Feasts and Gardens, and Company, and other such low and gross enjoyments.</p>
                     <p>Whereas the Doctrine of <hi>Christianity</hi> doth fix it upon things, that are much more spiritual and sublime; the Beatifical Vision, a clear unerring understanding, a perfect tranquillity of mind, a conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to God, a perpetual admiring and praising of him: Than which the mind of man cannot fancy any thing that is more excellent or desireable.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. As to the <hi>Means</hi> it directs to, for the attaining of this end, they are suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble both to the goodness and greatness of the <hi>end</hi> it self.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. For the Duties that are enjoyned in reference to <hi>Divine worship.</hi> They are so full of sanctity and spiritual devotion, as may shame all the pompous solemnities of other Religions, in their costly sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, their dark wild mysteries, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal observances. Whereas this refers chiefly to the holiness of the mind, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation to God, love of him, depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon him, submission to his Will, endeavouring to be like him.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="406" facs="tcp:62179:214"/>
2. And as for the Duties of the <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond-Table,</hi> which concern our mutual conversation towards one another; It al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows nothing that is hurtful or noxious, either to our selves, or others: Forbids all kind of injury or revenge, commands to overcome evil with good, to pray for enemies and persecutors, doth not admit of any mental, much less any cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral uncleanness; doth not tolerate any immodest or uncomely word or gesture; forbids us to wrong others in their goods and possessions, or to mispend our own; requires us to be very tender both of our own and other mens reputations: In brief, it injoyns nothing but what is help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and useful, and good for mankind. Whatever any Philosophers have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed concerning their moral virtues of <hi>Temperance,</hi> and <hi>Prudence,</hi> and <hi>Patience,</hi> and the duties of several relations, is here injoyned in a far more eminent, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime and comprehensive manner. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides such Examples and incitations to pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety as are not to be parallel'd elsewhere. The whole Systeme of its Doctrine being transcendently excellent, and so exactly conformable to the highest, purest rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, that in those very things wherein it goes beyond the rules of Moral Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:62179:214"/>
we cannot in our best judgment but consent and submit to it.</p>
                     <p>In brief, it doth in every respect so fully answer the chief scope and design of Religion, in giving all imaginable ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and submission to the Deity, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting the good of mankind, satisfying and supporting the mind of man, with the highest kind of enjoyments, that a rational soul can wish or hope for, as no other Religion or Profession whatsoever can pretend unto.</p>
                     <p>What hath briefly been said upon this argument may suffice to shew the exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing folly and unreasonableness of those men who are sceptical and indifferent as to any kind of Religion. 'Tis a vice this, that if it may not be styled direct <hi>Atheism,</hi> yet certainly it is the very next degree to it. And there is too much reason to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, that it doth in this generation very much abound, not only amongst the <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,</hi> but such also as would be thought the greatest <hi>Wits,</hi> and most knowing men. It hath been occasioned by that heat and zeal of men in those various contrary opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, which have of late abounded, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with those great scandals that have been given by the Professors of Religion
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:62179:215"/>
on several hands. From whence men of corrupt minds have taken occasion to doubt of all kind of Religion; and to look upon it only as a Political inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which doth no farther oblige, than as the Laws of several Countries do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for it. These common scandals have been the <hi>occasion,</hi> but the <hi>true ground</hi> at the bottom of such mens prejudice and dissatisfaction, is the strictness and purity of this Religion, which they find puts too great a restraint and check upon their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant lusts and passions.</p>
                     <p>I know they will <hi>pretend</hi> for their he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitation and indifferency in this kind, the want of clear and infallible evidence for the truth of Christianity; than which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more absurd and unworthy of a rational man. For let it be but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially considered; what is it, that such men would have? Do they expect Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical proof and certainty in Moral things? Why, they may as well expect to see with their ears, and hear with their eyes. Such kind of things (as I shewed at large in the beginning of this Treatise) being altogether as disproportioned to such kind of proofs, as the objects of the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral senses are to one another. The argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or proof to be used in several mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:62179:215"/>
are of various and different kinds, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the nature of the things to be proved. And it will become every rational man to yeild to such proofs, as the nature of the thing which he enquires about is capable of: And that man is to be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon as froward and contentious, who will not rest satisfied in such kind of Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence as is counted sufficient, either by all others, or by most, or by the wisest men.</p>
                     <p>If we suppose God to have made any Revelation of his Will to mankind, can any man propose or fancy any better way for conveying down to Posterity the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of it, than that clear and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Tradition which we have for the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Gospel? And must not that man be very unreasonable, who will not be content with as much evidence for an <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Book</hi> or <hi>matter of Fact,</hi> as any thing of that nature is capable of? If it be only infallible and mathematical Certainty that can settle his mind, why should he believe that he was born of such Parents, and belongs to such a Family? 'Tis possible men might have combined together to delude him with such a Tradition. Why may he not as well think, that he was born a Prince and not a Subject, and
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:62179:216"/>
consequently deny all duties of subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and obedience to those above him? There is nothing so wild and extravagant, to which men may not expose themselves by such a kind of nice and scrupulous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulity.</p>
                     <p>Whereas, if to the enquiries about Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion a man would but bring with him the same candour and ingenuity, the same readiness to be instructed, which he doth to the study of humane Arts and Sciences, that is, a mind free from violent preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices and a desire of contention; It can hardly be imagined, but that he must be convinced and subdued by those clear evidences which offer themselves to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry inquisitive mind, concerning the truth of the <hi>Principles of Religion</hi> in general, and concerning the <hi>Divine Authority</hi> of the <hi>H. Scriptures,</hi> and of the <hi>Christian Religion.</hi>

                     <bibl>HEB. 13. 7.</bibl>
                     <q>Remember them which have the Rule over you, who have spoken to you the word of God; whose Faith follow, consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the end of their conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</q>

                  <p>IN handling this Text of holy Scripture, that we may mingle nothing of Humane Affections, that our Passions may give no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption to you in hearing, or to me in speaking; I should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to suppress them quite, if it were possible. And possible it is, where they are slightly raised, as upon common and ordinary occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions:
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62179:225"/>
But where they are ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and strong, where they dare ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, and seem to have Reason on their side, as there is too much in sight for ours; there I think it is in vain to endeavour it: The only way in this case, is to give them some kind of Vent, to discharge them in part, and to govern what remains of the Affections.</p>
                  <p>You will I hope the rather bear with my Infirmity, that I cannot contain from deploring the Loss, the irreparable Loss that we suffer, I think all suffer, in the death of this Eminent Person. He was the man in whom his Friends had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of much good, and had hopes of much more; not so much for his greatness or power, as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracting from these, for what they found in himself, which was a great and manifold Blessing to all that lived within his conversation. He
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62179:225"/>
was a Father, a Counsellor, a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter, a Helper, a sure Friend: He was all they could wish in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Relation, and by the course of Nature, might have been for many years. But for our sins, (though for his unspeakable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage) the great and wise God was not pleased to continue that Blessing; He took him out of this World, when for ought we could judge, there was most need of such men to live in it; and when we had much reason to expect more good than ever by his living in it.</p>
                  <p>Oh the Unsearchable ways and Counsels of God! Oh the Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Humane hopes and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions! While we please our selves with the good we have in hand, while we reach out for more, as if there would never be an end, within a few days all withers, all
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62179:226"/>
vanisheth to This: We have No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing left, but what it grieves us to see; We have nothing remains, but what we are willing to be rid of, a poor shell of earth, that we make haste to bury out of our sight.</p>
                  <p>Yes; of wise and good men, which is their Priviledg above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, there remains after Death, a Memory, an Example which they leave behind them, as a sacred <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positum</hi> for us to keep and use un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til we see them again. Are these things Nothing in our sight? They are above all price in the sight of God; who, that they may be so to us, both telleth us the worth, and recommends them to our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem, and requires the fruit of them in many places of Scripture: But in none with more Application to our present Occasion, than in my Text. I shall sufficiently Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62179:226"/>
my choice of it, if I can but make it be understood: I shall shew the full Import of it, in those duties which it contains: I shall endeavour to stir you up to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise them with respect to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent occasion.</p>
                  <p>First, For the understanding of my Text, we are to look for no help from what goes next before it, or after it: For the whole business of it is contained within it self. It lies in the heap among other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, which without any certain connexion between them, were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the Writer of this Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> that is, to those <hi>Jews</hi> who were converted to be <hi>Christians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the time when it was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, we are certain of this, that it was while <hi>Timothy</hi> lived; for he is mentioned as living in the 24 Verse of this Chapter. And he being
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62179:227"/>
there said to have suffered Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the Gospel, this brings us a little nearer to the knowledg of the time: For then it must be after both S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles to <hi>Timothy.</hi> In the last of those Epistles, which was some years after the other, S. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks much of his own Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment for the Gospel: He warns <hi>Timothy</hi> oft, that he must suffer for the Gospel: He instructs him what to do when God shall call him to suffer. Not a word of any thing that he had suffered already: Nay, he counsels him as a young man, that had never been tried. He invites him to <hi>Rome,</hi> which was the great place of try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; in which place, as it appears in the close of this Chapter, <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> did suffer that Imprisonment for the Gospel, from which he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd, when this Epistle was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. It appears, that after the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62179:227"/>
to <hi>Timothy,</hi> how long after we know not, he did go to <hi>Rome,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> will'd him. How long he staid there we know not, ere he did suffer imprisonment. How long he was in Prison, we know not, ere he was set at liberty. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we know, it was a considerable time, we have reason to think it might be some years; it might be many years that this Epistle was written after the second Epistle to <hi>Timothy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And if so, then it was written, not only as <hi>Theodoret</hi> says, long after the death of <hi>James</hi> the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>John:</hi> But account it how you will, this Epistle was written, after the death of <hi>James</hi> the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of our Lord: Which <hi>James</hi> being the first Bishop of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and the other <hi>James</hi> an Apostle, that is, a Bishop at large, and both these being put to death at <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem;</hi>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:62179:228"/>
Not to search into Church-Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story for those others of their order, who dyed before this time in other places; nor to guess how many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were dead, that are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in Church-History: If we think of no more but these two eminent servants of Christ, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be to seek of the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Text, nor of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to our particular purpose. I say not, but it may have a more general extent. There is a memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry due, not only to the Apostles of Christ, and to the Bishops their Successors; but to all other good Ministers of Christ, yea to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther exemplary Christians. But if the Apostle had meant this only of Bishops, I cannot guess that he would have it exprest otherwise, than he hath done in my Text.</p>
                  <p>To prove this, I must have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to the Original, and not
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62179:228"/>
wholly depend upon our <hi>English</hi> Translation. For that he meant this of Bishops, it appears not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently, and of them being dead, not at all, in our Translation. And yet from the Original, I see no reason to doubt, that our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle in this Text, meant no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but Bishops, and those depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this life.</p>
                  <p>For the Order of Bishops, it is described by those acts of <hi>Ruling</hi> and <hi>Teaching,</hi> in the words of our Translation; but it is much more expresly by the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> in the Original. For the meaning of which word, to whom should we resort, but either to the Greeks, in whose Language; or to the Jews, for whose immediate use this was written? Among the Greeks <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is a general word, it signifies Rulers Ecclesiastical or Civil. In this Verse they take it for Ecclesiastical
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62179:229"/>
Rulers: So <hi>Chrysostom</hi> on my Text; and <hi>Oecumenius,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle speaks of Bishops in this Verse. If the Jews would say so too, what could we have more? They do say it, as much as we have reason to expect. In their Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Language they call one of our Bishops <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> which in effect is the word in my Text. So then we have the consent both of Greeks and of Hebrews, that is, of them who had most reason to know the meaning of the word, that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops are meant by the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> in my Text.</p>
                  <p>That the Apostle here speaks not of Living, but of Dead Bishops: of them that <hi>Had</hi> the <hi>Rule</hi> before <hi>that</hi> time; though 'tis rendred, that <hi>Have,</hi> in our Translation; it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by other words in my Text. <hi>Remember them,</hi> says the Apostle: What, those that are present?
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62179:229"/>
They are not the objects of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, but of Sense. Remember <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the good Bishops you have had: <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>them that have spoken to you,</hi> that have spoken their last, and shall speak no more in this world: <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>considering,</hi> looking back, or looking up to <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>the end of their conversation.</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> signifies the whole course of this life, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is the end or period of it. Look back, says the Apostle, to your Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops deceased, <hi>consider their end,</hi> or <hi>Exit,</hi> or going out of this world.</p>
                  <p>To confirm this, if any doubt, I shall desire him to compare this Verse with the 17 of this Chapter. In both Verses the Apostle speaks of the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that is, of Bishops, as I have interpreted and proved. In the 17. he shews our duty to the living, <hi>Obey them,</hi> says the Apostle,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62179:230"/>
                     <hi>and Submit your selves, for they watch for your souls.</hi> In this Verse he shews our duty to Bishops de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased; <hi>Remember them, and follow their Faith, considering the end of their conversation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I think more needs not be said, to shew the scope of my Text, and how applicable it is to our present Occasion. It being clear that the Apostle speaks here of Bishops, and of them being departed this life.</p>
                  <p>I now proceed to the duties re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired at our hands; <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Remember</hi> and <hi>Imitate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, <hi>Remember.</hi> 'Tis a natural desire that men have, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred when they are dead. We do not find it is so in any other creature: They desire to live as long as they can; but for ought we can judge, by any Indication, they have no regard to what shall
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62179:230"/>
come after. The reason is plain, for their Being determines with their life. But for man, among many other tokens of Immortality, he hath by secret Instinct, a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural desire to be thought of, and spoken of in after-times. We see this, not only in them that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed with the hope of a Future life; but even in those, that, for ought appears to us, know or think little of any more but the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.</p>
                  <p>What else made the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Kings lay out their wealth on Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramids, and the like stupendious buildings? What moved the old <hi>Greeks</hi> and the <hi>Romans,</hi> with so much care and expence to leave Statues and other Monuments, with Inscriptions of their names? What meant those in the unlettered Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, by the much harder shifts they have made to convey any
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62179:231"/>
thing of themselves to Posterity? I need not seek for instances of this in remote Times and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, when we see 'tis so frequent in our Age, and perhaps no-where more than in this City; for men of design, that think long before-hand, above all other things, to provide for this kind of Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. Some venture their lives, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wear out themselves, they do and suffer any thing to get estates: Not for themselves, that might be happier without them; nor so much for their known Heirs, whom they load with Entails, as for men whom they know not, but only hope they will be in after-times. <hi>For their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for ever, and their dwelling-place to all generations: they call their lands by their own names. This their way is their folly,</hi> and those that see it are such
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62179:231"/>
fools to take after them, says <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Psal.</hi> 49. 11.</p>
                  <p>But if this design take, it must be in spite of God, who hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared it shall not do. He will thwart wicked men. They that provide not for the true Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, shall lose their design in this shadow of it. Either their name shall be forgotten; God hath threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>he will cut it off, he will blot it out, their memory shall perish with them:</hi> Or if it survive, it shall be to their shame, <hi>their name shall rot, Prov.</hi> 10. 7. What they build for fame, shall be like <hi>Absoloms</hi> Pillar, which remains to this day; but the passers by throw stones at it, in detestation of his Memory: Such is generally, though not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, the curse of God that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sues wicked men.</p>
                  <p>Whereas contrariwise it is the Promise of God to the Just, <hi>that
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62179:232"/>
they shall always be had in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, Psal.</hi> 112. 6. And that <hi>their memory shall be blessed as far as known, Prov.</hi> 10. 7. Promises which, as all other of Temporal things, are to be understood with reserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Divine Oeconomy, to that wisdom of God which orders all things in the Government of the world. It becometh not the Majesty of him that governs all things, to break his course, and to work Miracles upon every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular occasion. 'Tis enough that he generally provideth that the same thing may be done otherwise, and declares it to those by whom it ought to be done. If they do it not, if there be a faileur in them; his Promise is not void, his word is not broken, since it was given with that Condition: Which being not performed by them that were to have done it, he can make repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62179:232"/>
to those that suffer by it; yea he hath done it already in this, that he hath given them that which this typifies. And what if they fall short of the shadow, when they have the substance, in a better and true Immortality?</p>
                  <p>The mean while we see what is required on our parts. As the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God, out of that store which he hath given us, We are to pay what he hath promised good men. 'Tis that which all naturally desire, but wicked men shall not attain; only to the just, God hath promised that we shall <hi>remember</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>em, and he commands that we should do it, especially for good Bishops departed this life.</p>
                  <p>Our remembrance of them doth not differ in kind, but in degree, from what we owe to the memory of others. 'Tis a duty we are to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62179:233"/>
pay them above others, in our Thoughts, in our Affections, in our Words, and in our Actions and Lives.</p>
                  <p>First, in our <hi>Thoughts;</hi> 'tis not a simple <hi>remembrance</hi> that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires; for that being an act of the sensitive soul, as I conceive, doth not directly fall under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept. For it is not in our power, to remember or forget, either what or when we please. But it is in our power, to do those acts which conduce to the exciting, or to the helping of our memory. This is that which God requires at our hands, that we should endeavour to turn our minds towards such objects, and contemplate in them the gifts and graces of God: that as oft as we think of them, we should acknowledg that good which was in them, and which we have received by their means: That we
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62179:233"/>
should pay them that honourable esteem which we owe to our spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Parents and Benefactors.</p>
                  <p>If we think upon them heartily in this manner, it will work some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing upon our <hi>Affections.</hi> We cannot but be sensible of the want of such men, and therefore grieved for our loss, when they are taken from us; as the <hi>Asian</hi> Bishops were at those words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> when he said, <hi>they should see his face no more.</hi> Though God intend it for their gain, whom he takes to himself, and he takes them in that time, which suits best with their Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances: Yet, even then, we have cause to grieve for our selves, and for the Church, who are deprived of the presence and use of such men. How much more, when for ought we know, they are taken away for our sins? When for ought we know, it was because the age
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62179:234"/>
was not worthy of them? For ought we know, 'tis in order to some judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, which will come the sooner when they are gone, when we have filled up the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of our iniquities?</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Elijah</hi> was taken away in a very evil age, <hi>Elisha</hi> cryed out, <hi>O my Father, my Father, the Chariots and Horsemen of Israel!</hi> What will become of <hi>Israel</hi> now thou art gone? We dare not think so highly of any one man. We have no such cause to despond of our Nation. When it is bad, we are to do our parts to make it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to pray that God would send more Labourers into his Harvest, that he would double his gifts and blessings on those that are left.</p>
                  <p>And for those we have lost, we must resign them to God; both ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging his bounty in giving them to us, and submitting to his
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62179:234"/>
will, in taking them to himself. So S. <hi>Bernard</hi> on the death of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Gerard, Lord,</hi> says he, <hi>thou hast given, and thou hast taken away; though we grieve that thou hast ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, yet we cannot forget that thou didst give him.</hi> Yea, we owe not only submission to God, but thankfulness too for their sakes who are delivered by this means from so great and such manifold evils, as continually hover about us in this life. From sickness and pain, from labour and danger, from sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and fear, and care, and what not? being delivered from Sin which is the Cause, and from that Flesh which is the Center of all this.</p>
                  <p>They are past all evils else, that have overcome Death: They leave sorrow to us, who call our selves the living: Their life, the only true life, is immutable Joy, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62179:235"/>
Rest, Peace, and Felicity.</p>
                  <p>Which if we seriously believe, if we desire to be with them, we cannot sorrow for our loss, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out joy for their gain, and thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving on their behalf, to that good God, <hi>who hath given them the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry through our Lord Jesus Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But thus much we owe upon the death of every true Christian, though of never so mean a rank and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. We are to be thankful to God for his mercies, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess it, as we are taught in the Offices of our Church; which have the same words of burial, for the meanest of our communion, as for those that are highest in their Graces and Gifts.</p>
                  <p>But there is a remembrance in Words that is due to these, and not to the other; namely, the due praise of those their excellent Graces and Gifts; which though they have
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62179:235"/>
not of themselves, but through the bounty and liberality of God, who is therefore to be chiefly respected and glorified, in all the praise that we give to his creatures: Yet since he is pleased to do them this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour above others, and to make choice of them whom he so digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies; we are bound to allow it them, we are to follow Gods choice, to give them praise whom he hath so qualified for it. Only with this care, that we do it truly, not to flatter the dead; and profitably, for the example and imitation of the living.</p>
                  <p>We have so much reason to do this, that they who had only rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to guide them, the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> upon the death of any eminent persons, had Orations made pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly in their praise. The <hi>Jews,</hi> without any particular Law for it, had honour done to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62179:236"/>
of Worthy persons at their Funerals, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32. <hi>ult.</hi> The Rites of it are partly described, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16. 14. They laid their dead in a bed full of the richest perfumes, which also were publickly burnt at the Interment. To which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Preacher alludes, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 7. 1. where he says, <hi>A good name is better than precious oyntment, and the day of ones death than the day of ones birth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When one cometh into the World, none knows how he may prove; if he do well in it, he goes out with this publick testimony. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which the <hi>Jews</hi> never mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed such persons without a blessing on their memory.</p>
                  <p>But above all others, the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Christians were very observant this way. They saw it was the will of their Lord and Master, that the good work which was
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62179:236"/>
done upon him by <hi>Mary,</hi> should be kept in perpetual memory, and is therefore recorded in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. They saw how the works of <hi>Dorcas</hi> were shewn at her death, the Coats and Garments which she made for the poor. They saw what need there was of great Incentives, in those days, when Christianity was a most dangerous Profession. It is of no small force, to make men love a Religion, when they see it infuses excellent Principles, that it excites so suitable practises, that it is proof against suffering and death. And the experience of that power it hath in some, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes and animates others to the same.</p>
                  <p>Upon these and the like consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, and perhaps with allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to that Text, where S. <hi>John</hi> is said to have seen the souls of the Martyrs under the Altar; They
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62179:237"/>
had their <hi>Memorias Martyrum,</hi> their places of Worship, where they placed the Altars over the bodies of their Martyrs. What, with any intention to worship the Martyrs? It was so suggested by the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries, and as vehemently denied by the Christians of those times. By those of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted acts of <hi>Polycarpus: We cannot</hi> (say they) <hi>worship any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than Christ; We love the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs as being followers of Christ; We celebrate the days of their passions with Joy; We do it both in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of those Champions of God, and to train up and prepare others for the like conflicts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Besides this, which was peculiar to the Martyrs, they had a lower degree of remembrance, for Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, and Confessors, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eminent persons departed this life: whom they not only praised
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62179:237"/>
in Orations at their Funerals, but writ their names in their Diptychs, or two-leaved Records, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in one page all the names of the Living; in the other, the Dead that were of note in the Church.</p>
                  <p>All these were recited in the Communion-Service: Where, as the Living for themselves; so for the Dead, came their Friends, and gave Oblations and Alms. Which, before they were distributed among the poor, were first offered up to God in a prayer, like that which we use for the Church Militant here on Earth. These Doles were their only Sacrifices for the dead: Only Alms to the poor, <hi>with which sacrifices God is well-pleased.</hi> And their prayers were not for any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from pains; unless the Patriarchs, and Prophets, and the Apostles, and Virgin Mother of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62179:238"/>
Christ, were in the same pains too, and needed the same Deliverance. For they were all mentioned alike, and together, as it is to be seen in the ancientest Liturgies.</p>
                  <p>Among all these Innocent Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Rites of the Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, was there any thing of prayer for souls in Purgatory? Was there any thing of prayer to Saints departed this life? Was there any foundation for those superstitious Observances, Of adoring their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, of Prostration to their Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, of Pilgrimage to their Shrines, of making Vows, of saying Masses, of Offering to them, and the like? The Papists say there was, they plead the practice of the Church for it, they wrest places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to their purpose. Nay the <hi>Rhemists</hi> and others, alledge this very Text, without which I should not have mention'd them at this time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:62179:238"/>
But as the Learnedst men among themselves have been so just not to charge this upon my Text, and some of them confess they have no ground for these things in any one Text of Canonical Scripture: So they would do us but right to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg, that none of these things was practis'd for some hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of years after Christianity came into the world.</p>
                  <p>In those Primitive times all their Offices for the Dead, were, either to give Testimony of that Faith in which they died, and that death had not dissolv'd their Communion with the Living: or they were to bless God for their holy Life, and happy Death: or to Pray to him, not for their deliverance from Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, of which there was no Faith in those times; but for the Increase of that Good which they believ'd them to be possest of already, or
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62179:239"/>
for the Attainment of that farther good which they thought they were sure of, namely, for their speedy and happy Resurrection, for their perfect discharge at the day of Judgement, for the Consummation of their bliss with their own in the Kingdom of Glory.</p>
                  <p>Not to say how the Fathers dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer among themselves in these par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars; or how many of these particulars are omitted in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church as well as ours; it is enough that here is nothing makes for them, but much against those their Errors and Corruptions. All that is agreed on all hands, or that we find in the Practice of the first Ages, being sufficiently contain'd in those Offices of our Church; in the prayer for the Church-Militant, in the Collect on <hi>All-Saints</hi> day, and in the Office for the burial of the Dead; where we pray, <hi>That
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:62179:239"/>
it would please God of his gracious goodness, shortly to accomplish the number of his Elect, and to hasten his Kingdom, that we, with all those that are departed in the true faith of his holy Name, may have our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect consummation and bliss, both in body and soul, in his everlasting glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, <hi>Remembrance</hi> in <hi>Action</hi> is the other duty enjoyn'd in my Text, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Imitate their Faith,</hi> that is, their Christian pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession and practice, their whole Life and Conversation, according to their own belief of that word which they have spoken.</p>
                  <p>The Reason of this duty is plain: for it is our business in this world to recover the Image of God in which he created us; to be like him here in Righteousness and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, that we may be like him hereafter in Glory and Happiness.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="32" facs="tcp:62179:240"/>
To this End, God has given us those Lineaments of himself, which are written sufficiently in our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but more fully and distinctly in Scripture. In which Scripture, he so oft and so vehemently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires us, <hi>Be ye Holy, as I am Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; be ye Just, as I am Just; be ye Merciful, as I am Merciful; be ye Pure, as I am Pure; be ye Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, as your heavenly Father is Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This good Word of God, which was given by the Prophets and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, is still inclucated on us by them <hi>that speak to us the word of God.</hi> Which Office being primari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Bishops, as appears in my Text, They are first and above all others to conform themselves to it, to shew others how possible and how practicable it is.</p>
                  <p>Our Apostle suppos'd this in those Primitive Bishops in my Text.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62179:240"/>
God requires it of all that suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed them in the Church. So of <hi>Timothy,</hi> though he were young in Age, yet being in that Place, <hi>Be thou an Example to believers in word, in conversation, in spirit, in faith, in truth,</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 12. and in the last Verse, <hi>Take heed to thy Self, and to thy Doctrine: Do this constantly and continually, and so thou shalt save both thy self and them that hear thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whether they do this or no, they are our <hi>Teachers</hi> and <hi>Rulers;</hi> therefore in the 17 Verse of this Chapter, while they live, we must <hi>obey</hi> their Word, and <hi>submit</hi> to their Government. When they are dead, both for what they are, and were, we may do well to say no ill of them; and since we can say no good, e'en forget them, and leave them to God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:62179:241"/>
But if they are such as they ought, which the Apostle supposes in my Text, if they live as men that believe themselves what they say: 'Tis our duty, not only to <hi>submit</hi> and <hi>obey</hi> them while they live; but also to <hi>Remember</hi> them when they are dead: <hi>Remember</hi> them, in our <hi>thoughts,</hi> with that honour they deserve; In our <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,</hi> with a due sense of our loss, and their gain: Remember them <hi>in words,</hi> with the just praise of their actions and lives: In our prayers to God, with due thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness for their graces and gifts in this life, and for the glory they receive after death: Lastly, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to <hi>follow</hi> them in that holy way, which leads to so happy an end: In our Apostles words, <hi>fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their Faith, considering</hi> the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, the blessed <hi>end of their</hi> good <hi>conversation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="35" facs="tcp:62179:241"/>
What my Text says in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of Bishops deceased, 'tis most easie to apply. I know it hath been done all this while, by them that knew the virtuous and great mind that lately dwelt in this body. They know the truth of all I shall say, and much more that might be said in his just commendation. But the little I can bring within the time I have left, being said from many years experience, will at least stir up those that knew him not, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire; and if they find these things true, they know their duty of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance</hi> and <hi>Imitation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I shall not be minute, in draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all I say under these heads: for I speak to them that can distinguish and sort things, as they belong to the one, or to the other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="36" facs="tcp:62179:242"/>
To begin with the Natural endowments of his Mind; I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think of him without just re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection upon that Paradox, of the Equality of Souls. He was surely a great Instance to the contrary; having that largeness of Soul in every respect, which was much above the rate of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary men. He had an Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that extended to all parts of useful Learning and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg; a Will always disposed to Great, and Publick, and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous things. He had a natural aversion from all idle speculations, and from the eager pursuit of small and frivolous designs. In great matters, he judged so well, that he was not usually surprized with events. He pursued his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions with such equalness of mind, that he was never car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:62179:242"/>
beyond the calmness of his Natural Temper, except through his zeal for Publick good, or where his Friend was concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>What he was in his Studies, I have reason to know, that have often been tired with studying with him. He was indefatigable, and would have worn himself out, if he had not been relieved with multiplicity of business. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, he impaired by it, a Body which seemed to have been built for a long Age, and contracted those Infirmities that hastened his death.</p>
                  <p>The effect of his Studies, in his Preaching and Writings, are suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently known, and would have been much more, if God had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:62179:243"/>
As for his Preaching, it was sometimes famous near this place; though he sought rather the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, than the praise of his hearers. He spoke solid truth, with as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle shew of Art as was possible. He exprest all things in their true and natural colours; with that aptness and plainness of Speech, that grave natural way of Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, that shewed he had no design upon his hearers. His plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness was best for the instruction of the simple; and for the better sort, who were in truth an Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent Auditory, it was enough that they might see he had no mind to deceive them. He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied himself rather to their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding than Affections. He saw so much of the beauty of Goodness himself, that he thought the bare shewing of it was enough
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:62179:243"/>
to make all wise men, as it did him, to be in love with it.</p>
                  <p>In his Writings he was judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and plain, like one that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued not the circumstances so much as the substance. And he shewed it in whatsoever Argument he undertook; sometimes beating out new untravel'd ways, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times repairing those that had been beaten already: No subject he handled, but I dare say is the better for him; and will be the sier for them that come after him.</p>
                  <p>If in these he went sometimes beside his Profession, it was in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Design of it, to make men wiser and better, which I think is the business of Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Knowledg. And this he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted with much zeal and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, in hope of the great Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:62179:244"/>
that may accrew to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
                  <p>It was his aim, as in all things, so especially in that which, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, is much more censured than understood; I mean, in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of the Royal Society. He joined himself to it with no other end, but to promote Modern knowledg, without any contempt or lessening of those great men in former times. With due honour to whom, he thought it lawful for others to do that which, we have no reason to doubt, they themselves would have done if they were living.</p>
                  <p>I would not seem to excuse that which deserveth commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and encouragement; or to commend other things, for want of subject in him. Therefore lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this Theme in better hands,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:62179:244"/>
I proceed next to speak of his Virtues and Graces; and these the rather, as being both to be <hi>remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred</hi> and <hi>followed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And in speaking of these, where shall I begin? Nay when shall I end, if I say all that may be spoken? I think it not worth while to speak of those that are Vulgar, though he had them also in no common degree: Nor would I seem to make any Virtue a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety. But there are those which are not common to many, and were generally acknowledged to be in him; though they appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not so to some other men, as they did to those that intimately knew him.</p>
                  <p>His Prudence was great, I think it seldom failed in any thing to which he applied himself. And yet he wanted that part, which
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:62179:245"/>
some hold to be essential; he so wanted Dissimulation, that he had rather too much openness of heart. It was Sincerity indeed that was Natural to him; he so abhorred a Lye, that he was not at all for shew; he could not put on any thing that look'd like it. And presuming the same of other men, through excess of Benignity, he would be sometimes deceived, in believing they were what they seem'd to be, and what he knew they ought to have been.</p>
                  <p>His greatness of mind, was known to all that knew any thing of him. He neither eagerly sought any Dignity, nor declined any Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of doing good. He look'd down upon Wealth, as much as others admire it: He knew the use of an Estate, but did not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet it. What he yearly received
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:62179:245"/>
of the Church, he bestowed in its service. As for his Temporal estate, being secured against want, he sought no farther, he set up his rest; I have heard him say often, <hi>I will be no richer,</hi> and I think he was as good as his word.</p>
                  <p>As for Revenge, how could it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the breast of him that hated nothing but that which makes us hateful to God? I say not but he had a sense of personal injuries; and especially of those that reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon his name, when they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from those that had good names of their own. What others said, he despised; but by those he would often wish he had been bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter understood: That he was not, he bore as his misfortune; he would not requite them with the like, but mention'd them with all due Respect, and was always rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:62179:246"/>
to oblige them, and to do them good.</p>
                  <p>Yet it was not so desirable, (I say not to be his Enemy, for He did not account them so, but) to be at those terms with him, as to be his Acquaintance or Friend. They that were never so little familiar with him, could not but find, as well Benefit as Delight in his conversation. His Discourse was commonly of useful things; it never caused trouble or weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to the Hearer. Yet he would venture to displease one for his good; and indeed he was the man that ever I knew, for that most needful, and least practised point of Friendship. He would not spare to give seasonable reproof, and wholesome advice, when he saw occasion. I never knew any that would do it so freely, and

that knew how to manage that freedom of speech so inoffensive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
                  <p>It was his way of Friendship, not so much to oblige men, as to do them good. He did this not slightly and superficially, but like one that made it his Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. He durst do for his Friend, any thing that was honest, and no more. He would undertake nothing but what well became him, and then he was unwearied till he had effected it.</p>
                  <p>As he concerned himself for his Friend, in all other respects, so especially in that, which went nearest to him of all earthly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments. He would not suffer any blot to be thrown, or to lye upon his Friends good Name, or his Memory. And that Office I am obliged to requite, in giving
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:62179:247"/>
some account of that which has been spoken by some to his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage.</p>
                  <p>I shall neglect, for he did so, any frivolous reports; but that which seems to have any weight in it, as far as I have observed, is, that he had not that zeal for the Church, that they would seem to have that object this. He seemed to look upon the Dissenters with too much favour to their persons and ways.</p>
                  <p>As to the persons: No doubt that goodness of Nature, that true Christian Principle, which made him willing to think well of all men, and to do good, or at least no hurt to any, might and ought to extend it self to them among others. But besides, he was inclined to it by his edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation under his Grandfather Mr.
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:62179:247"/>
                     <hi>Dod,</hi> a truly pious and learned man; who yet was a Dissenter himself in some things.</p>
                  <p>Not that he had any delight in contradiction, or could find in his heart to disturb the peace of the Church for those matters: He was so far from it, that as I have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently heard from this his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child and others, when some thought their Dissents ground enough for a War, he declared himself against it, and confirmed others in their Allegiance: He profest to the last a just hatred of that horrid Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion. Now his Relation to this man, and conversation with those of his Principles, might incline him to hope the like of others of that way. And when he found them farther off from the unity of the Church; he might possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly overdo, through the vehemence
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:62179:248"/>
of his desire, to bring them off of their Prejudices, and to reduce them to the Unity of the Church; in which his Grandfather lived and dyed: Why might he not hope the same of other Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters?</p>
                  <p>As for himself, he was so far from Approving their ways, that in the worst of times, when one here present bewailed to him the Calamities of the Church, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared his Obedience even then to the Laws of it: He incouraged him in it, he desired his friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and protected both him and many others, by an interest that he had gained, and made use of chiefly for such purposes.</p>
                  <p>How he demeaned himself then, is known in both Universities; where he governed with praise, and left a very grateful Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:62179:248"/>
behind him. How in the next times since, I cannot speak in a better Place. And when I have named this City, and the two Universities, I think he could not be placed in a better Light in this Nation. There were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that could judg, and he did not use to disguise himself; I appeal to you that conversed with him in those days, What zeal he hath exprest, for the Faith, and for the unity of the Church: How he stood up in defence of the Order and Government: How he hath asserted the Liturgy, and the Rites of it: He conformed himself to every thing that was commanded. Beyond which, for any man to be vehement, in lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and unnecessary things, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for or against them, he could not but dislike; and as his free
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:62179:249"/>
manner was, he hath oft been heard to call it Fanaticalness. How this might be represented I know not, or how his design of comprehension might be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood.</p>
                  <p>Sure I am, that since he came into the Government of the Church, to which he was called in his Absence; he so well became the Order, that it out-did the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all that did not very well know him. He filled his place with a Goodness answerable to the rest of his life; and with a Prudence above it, considering the two extreams, which were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where so much as in his Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess. Though he was, as before, very tender to those that differed from him; yet he was, as before, exactly conformable himself, and brought others to Conformity, some
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:62179:249"/>
Eminent men in his Diocess. He endeavoured to bring in all that came within his reach, and might have had great success, if God had pleased to continue him.</p>
                  <p>But having given full proof of his intentions and desires, it pleased God to reserve the fruit for other hands, from which we have great cause to expect much good to the Church.</p>
                  <p>He was in perfect Health in all other respects; when a known Infirmity, from an unknown cause, that had been easier to cure, than it was to discover, stole upon him, and soon became in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable.</p>
                  <p>He was for many days in a prospect of Death, which he saw as it approached, and felt it come on by degrees. Some days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he died, he found within
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:62179:250"/>
himself, as he often said, <hi>a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenoe of Death.</hi> In all this time, first of Pain, then of dreadful Apprehension, at last in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of Death; Who ever saw him dismaid? Who ever found him surprized? or heard a word from him, unbecoming a wise man, and a true Christian? It was my infelicity to be so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, that I could not duly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend him; and so deceived with vain hopes, that I believed him not dying, till he was dead. But at the times I was with him, I saw great cause to admire his Faith towards God, his Zeal for his Church, his Constancy of Mind, his Contempt of the World, and his Chearful hopes of Eternity. I have heard much more upon these heads, from those that were with him. Some
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:62179:250"/>
of you may have heard other things from other men. It hath been the way of our Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to entitle themselves to dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men, even those, whose whole life was a Testimony against them. Thus after the Death of our Famous <hi>Jewel,</hi> the Papists were pleased to say, he dyed of their Religion. <hi>Militiere</hi> hath ventured to insinuate the same, of our late King of blessed and glorious memory. Mens <hi>Tongues</hi> and Pens are their <hi>own;</hi> but lest they should abuse them and you, and the Memory of this worthy Prelate, as they have abus'd o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, (though nothing needs to be said to such groundless Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies) I declare, and that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on most certain grounds, That he died in the Faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, and in the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:62179:251"/>
Communion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as it is by Law establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>He died only too soon for the Church, and for his Friends: But for himself he had lived long enough. He has lived long e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that dyes well. For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever he wants of that which we call time, it is added, though it adds nothing to Eternity.</p>
                  <p>As for us that are now to try how we can bear the want of those many blessings we enjoyed in him; What shall we say? We must submit to the Will of God. Our Comfort is, that we shall follow, and come together again in due time. Till when, Farewel pious and virtuous Soul, Farewel great and excellent man, Farewel worthy Prelate and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Friend. We have thy Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:62179:251"/>
and Example, Thou hast our Praises and our Tears. While thy Memory lives in our Breasts, may thy Example be fruitful in our Lives: That our Meeting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain may be in Joy unspeakable, when God shall have wiped away all Tears from our Eyes.</p>
