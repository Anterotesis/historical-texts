            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

to obeye the same, Amen. Thou mayest (good

is the kingdome of faces (that is, the mygh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tye

Thomas Cra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mer that most worthy Archebishop
of Cantorbury. He cyteth him to appeare to make
answere at Rome, geuing hym .lxxx. dayes respite,
for his appearaunce there. Is this any thing but
a face of iustice? as thoughe the court of Rome
wolde condemne no man, before he answered for
him selfe, as bothe lawe and equitie require? But
the very same instaunt tyme, Antichristes holynesse

vnto that periured beastly Brockes B. of Glou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cestre,
to degrade and depriue him of his dignitie.
Which thing he did, not only before the .lxxx. dayes
were ended, but before ther were .iiij. of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> spent.
Furthermore wher as the sayd most reuerende fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

was notorious both in Englande, and also in the

was cited to appeare at Rome, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> .lxxx.
daye after, ther to make answer to

me, vpon the behalfe of the

which maters the Thursday folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing
were obiected against me by
Doctour Martin, and D. Storie your
maiesties proctours, before the bishop
of Gloucestre, sittyng in iudgement
by Commissio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from Rome. But alas,
it can not but greue the heart of any
natural subiecte, to be accused of the

or by autoritie comming fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son

               <p>An other cause why I refused the

shoulde vse suche language, as
the people may vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de, &amp; take pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite
therby, or elles holde their peace.
For as an harpe or lute, yf it geue no
<pb facs="tcp:16929:8"/>
certain sounde, that me maye knowe,
what is striken, who can daunce af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it, for all the sounde is in vayne?
so is it vayne and profiteth nothing
(sayeth almightie God, by the mouth
of S. Paule) if the priest speake to the
people in a language which they
knowe not. For elles he maye profite
him selfe, but profiteth not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people,
sayeth S. Paule.</p>
               <p>But herein I was answered thus:
that S. Paule spake only of preachi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g,
that the preacher should speake in a
tongue which the people did knowe:
or elles his preaching auaileth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
This I wolde haue spoken, &amp;
could not be suffred. But if the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
auaileth nothing, being spoken
in a language, which the people vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande
not: how should any other
seruice auaile them, being spoken in
the same language? And yet S. Paule
ment not only of preaching, it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
playnly by his owne wordes.
For he speaking by name expressely
of prayeng, singing, lauding, and
thanking of God, and of all other
thinges which the priestes saye in
the churches, wherunto the people
saye Amen: which they vsed not in
<pb facs="tcp:16929:8"/>
preachi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, but in other diuine seruice:
that whether the priestes rehearse the
wonderfull workes of God, or the
great benefites of God vnto man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynde
aboue all other creatures: or
geue thankes vnto God, or make ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
profession of their faithe, or humble
confession of their synnes, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> earnest
request of mercie and forgeuenesse:
or make sute or request vnto God, for
any thing: that than all the people vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
what the priestes saye,
might geue theyr myndes and voices
with them, and saye, Amen. That is
to saye, allowe what the priestes saye,
that the rehearsal of Goddes vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
workes and benefites, the geuing
of thankes, the profession of faithe, the
confessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of synnes, and the requestes
and peticions of the priestes and the
people might ascende vp into the
eares of God altogether, and be as
a swete sauour, odour, &amp; incense in his
nose, &amp; thus was it vsed many hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred
yeares after Christes ascension. But
thaforesaid thinges can not be done,
wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the priestes speake to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> people in
a language not knowen. And so they
(or their clearke in their name) saye
Amen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not tel whervnto:
<pb facs="tcp:16929:9"/>
Wher as S. Paule sayeth, how can y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
people saye <hi>Amen</hi> to thy well sayeng,
whan they vnderstande not what
thow sayest. And thus was S. Paule
vnderstanden of al interpretours bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the
Grekes and latines, olde &amp; newe,

               <p>☞ That is to saye: We co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunde, that
all Bishoppes and priestes celebrate the
holy oblacion and prayers vsed in holy
Baptisme, not after a still close maner,
but with a cleare loude voice, that they
maye be playnly hearde of the faythfull
people, so as the hearers myndes maye
be lyfted vp therby with the greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocion,
in vttring the prayses of the
Lorde God. For so Paule teacheth also
in the epistle to the Corinthians. Yf the

               <p>And not only the ciuile lawe and al

haue expounded S. Paule not of prea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ching

in the churche, but also reason geueth

or elles as S. Paule sayeth,

that the people commyng to the

against God.</p>
               <p>And agayn I said, wher as our sa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ueour
Christ ordayned the sacrament
of his most precious bodye and blood
to be receaued of all christian people
vnder the formes bothe of bread and
wyne, &amp; said of the cuppe, Drynke ye al
of this: the pope geueth a cleane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb facs="tcp:16929:10"/>
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that no lay men
shal drynke of the cuppe of their salua<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cion:
as though the cuppe of saluacion
by the blood of Christ, perteined not to
laye men. And wher as <hi>Theophilus Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andrinus</hi>
(whose workes S. Ierome did
translate about .xi. hundred yeares
past) sayeth, that yf Christ had ben cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
for the deuilles, his cuppe should
not be denyed them. Yet the Pope de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyeth
the cup of Christ to christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
for who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Christ was crucified. So
that if I should obey the pope in these
thinges, I must nedes disobey my sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueour
Christ.<note place="margin">Marke wel.</note> But I was answered
herunto as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly the papistes do an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> forme of bread is hole
Christes fleshe &amp; blood: so that whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
receaueth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> forme of bread, recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
aswel Christes blood as his flesh.
Let it be so. Yet in the forme of breade
only, Christes blood is not dronken,
but eaten: nor is receaued in the cuppe
in the forme of wyne, as Christ com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded:
but eaten w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the fleshe vnder
the forme of bread. And moreouer the
bread is not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacrament of his blood,
but of his fleshe onely: nor the cuppe
is not the sacrament of his fleshe, but
of his blood onely.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:16929:11"/>
And so the pope kepeth from all laye
persones the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of their rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
by Christes blood, whiche Christ
commaundeth to be geuen vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
               <p>And furthermore Christ ordayned
the sacrament in two kyndes, the one
seperated from the other, to be a repre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sentacion
of his deathe, wher his
blood was separated from his fleshe,
which is not represe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted in one kynde
alone. So that the laye people receaue
not the hole sacrament, wherby Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes
deathe is represented, as he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded.</p>
               <p>Moreouer as the pope taketh vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
him to geue the temporall sworde, or
royall and Imperiall power to kyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges

take vpon hym to depose them from

taketh vpon hym to geue empires &amp;
kingdomes (being non of his) to suche
as will fall downe and worship him,
and kysse his fete. And moreouer his
lawers and glosers so flattre him, that
they feyne he maye commaunde em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours
<pb facs="tcp:16929:12"/>
and kinges to holde his styr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rop,
whan he lighteth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his horse,
and to be his fotemen. And that if any
emperour or king geue hym any thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g,
they geue him nothing, but that is his
owne. And that he maye dispense a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Goddes worde, against bothe
the olde and newe testament, against
saynt Paules epistles, and against the
Gospel. And furthermore whatsoeuer
he dothe, although he drawe innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable

in to hell: Yet maye no mortal man re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>proue
him: bicause he being iudge of

And thus he sytteth in the temple of
God,<note place="margin">The pope is Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, that is, Christes enemye.</note> as he were a God, and nameth

                  <pb facs="tcp:16929:13"/>
And as touching y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sacrament,<note place="margin">The sacra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment.</note> I
sayed: Forasmuche as the hole mater
standeth in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vnderstanding of these
wordes of Christ, This is my body,
This is my blood: I sayed, that Christ
in these wordes made demonstracion
of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bread &amp; wyne, and spake figurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uely,
calling bread his bodye, &amp; wyne
his blood: bicause he ordayned them
to be sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes of his body &amp; blood.
And wher y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> papistes say in those two
pointes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary vnto me, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Christ cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
not bread his body, but a substau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
vncertayn, nor spake figuratiuely:
Herein I sayed, I wolde be iudged by
the olde churche. And which doctrine
could be proued the elder, that I wold
sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de vnto. And forasmuche as I haue
alleged in my boke many olde autors
bothe Grekes &amp; latines, which about
a thousaunt yeares after Christ conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
taught as I doo: if they could
bring furthe but one olde autor, that
sayeth in these two poyntes, as they
saye: I offred vj. or vij. yeares agoo, &amp;
doo offre yet still, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I will geue place
vnto them. But whan I bring furthe
any autor that sayeth in most playne
termes as I doo, yet sayeth the other
partie, that the autors ment not so: as
who shoulde saye, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> autors spake
<pb facs="tcp:16929:14"/>
one thing, and ment cleane contrary.
And vpon the other parte, whan they
can not fynde any one autor, that say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in wordes, as they saye, yet saye
they, that the autors me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t as they saye.
Now whether I or they speake more
to the purpose herein, I referre me to
the iudgemet of al indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t hearers.
Yea the olde churche of Rome aboue
a thousaunt yeares together, neither
beleued nor vsed the Sacrament, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
church of Rome hathe done of late yea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>res.
For in the beginning y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> churche of
Rome taught a pure and a sounde doc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trine
of the sacrament. But after that
the churche of Rome fell in to a newe
doctrine of transubstanciacion: w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the
doctrine they chaunged the vse of the
sacrament, contrary to that Christ
commaunded, and the olde churche
of Rome vsed aboue a thousaunt
yeares. And yet to deface the olde,
they saye that the newe is the olde:
wherin for my parte, I am content
to the tryall of stande.<note place="margin">The papi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stes make Christ two bodies.</note> But their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
is so fonde and vncomfortable,
that I maruail, that any man wold
allowe it, if he knewe what it is. But
what so euer they beare the people in
hande, that which they wryte in their
<pb facs="tcp:16929:14"/>
bokes hathe nother truthe nor co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort.
For by their doctrine, of one body of
Christ is made two bodies: one natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
hauing distaunce of membres w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> forme
and proporcion of a mans per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite
body, and this body is in heauen.</p>
               <p>But the body of Christ in the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,
by their owne doctrine, must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
be a monstrous body, hauing nei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther
distau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of membres, nor forme,
facion, or proporcion of a mannes na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
body. And suche a body is in the
sacrament, teache they: and goth in to
the mouthe with the forme of bread,
and entreth no farther tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the forme
of bread gothe: nor tarieth no longer
than the forme of bread is by natural
heat in digesting. So that whan the
forme of bread is digested, that body
of Christ is gone.<note place="margin">Marke.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And forasmuche as euil men be
as long in digesting as good men, the
body of Christ (by their doctrine) en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treth
as farre, and tarieth as long in
wicked men, as in godly men. And
what co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort can be herein to any chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
men, to receaue Christes vnsha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
body, &amp; it to entre no farther than
the stomacke, and to departe by &amp; by,
as sone as the bread is consumed?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:16929:15"/>
It semeth to me a more sounde &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
doctrine,<note place="margin">The soun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de true doctrine of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</note> that Christ hath but
one body, &amp; that hathe forme &amp; facio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of
a mannes true body: which body spiri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tually
entreth into the hole ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, bodye
&amp; soule. And though the sacrament be
consumed, yet hole Christ remayneth,
&amp; fedeth the receauer vnto eternal life,
if he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue in godlynesse: &amp; neuer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parteth,
vntill y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> receauer forsake him.
And as for the wicked, they haue not
Christ within them at al, who can not
be where Belial is. And this is my
fayth, and (as me semeth) a sounde do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
according to goddes worde, &amp;
sufficient for a christian to beleue in
that mater.<note place="margin">That can they neuer doo.</note> And if it can be shewed vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to
me, that the Popes autoritie is not
preiudicial to the thinges before me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned:
or that my doctrine in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is erroneous (which I thinke
can not be shewed) than I was neuer
nor wilbe so peruerse, to stande wilful<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
in myne owne opinion, but I shall
(with all humilitie) submitte my selfe
vnto the Pope,<note place="margin">The bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Glouces<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tres periu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</note> not only to kisse his
fete, but an other parte also.</p>
               <p>An other cause why I refused to take
the b. of Gloucestre for my iudge, was
the respecte of his owne person being
<pb facs="tcp:16929:15"/>
more than ones periured. Furst for
that he being diuerse tymes sworne,
neuer to consent that the B. of Rome
should haue any iurisdicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> within this
realme, but to take the king, &amp; his suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours
for supreme heades of this
realme, as by goddes lawes they be.
Contrary to that lawfull othe the said
B. sate than in iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t by autoritie
from Rome, wherin he was periured,
and not worthy to syt as a iudge.</p>
               <p>The seconde periurie was, that he
toke his bishoprike bothe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Quenes
Maiestie &amp; of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pope, making to eche
of them a solemne othe. Which othes
be so contrarie, that the one must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
be periured. And furthermore in

him selfe an enemy to the Imperial

I refused to take him for my iudge.</p>
