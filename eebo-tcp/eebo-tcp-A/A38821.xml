            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </opener>
            <p>
               <hi>IT</hi> is for the amplyfying of your Name and Dignity, for the Patronizing and
Securing of true Religion at home and abroad, and in ſpecial gratitude to my
Maſters in the Faith, that I introduce theſe undone <hi>French</hi> Supplicants to
Petition and Appeal to your Majeſty and your Grand Council for your Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
or ſome other Redreſs, which they with all poſſible ſubmiſſion and reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
Applications, nay with tears of Blood, and with broken Hearts and Backs, have
long ſought in vain of that incroaching Monarch that rules and tramples over them:
as may appear by theſe following Sheets.</p>
            <p>That which makes them conceive the greater Truſt and Confidence, is certain Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
of your Majeſties, and that particularly of Defender of the Faith, which they
hope you will think to fulfil, according as occaſion at home will ſuffer your Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to turn your eyes to their Exigencies and the preſent Opportunities abroad.</p>
            <p>The Solemn Embaſſies that your Majeſties Proteſtant Predeceſſors ſent thither, for
to expoſtulate with the French Kings concerning the illegal oppreſſions of the <hi>Hugue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mem. of <hi>Rohan.</hi> and others.</note>
contrary to the Edict of <hi>Nantes,</hi> (whereof the Kings of <hi>England</hi>
were held the Guaranties,) were allowed and are found Recorded in
their own Memoires and Regiſters of State, without the leaſt animadverſion or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim,
it being a Privilege that the Kings of this Realm had uſed as their right to
practiſe and inſiſt upon; and which we in our days ought by no means to loſe by
Preſcription. Now if that King ſhould go about to huff at any Forraign Princes
concerning himſelf in this Nature, with the State of his Subjects; beſides the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
reaſons, his mouth may be ſtopped with this <hi>argumentum ad hominem.</hi> That
he himſelf took the ſame liberty in writing to the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> in favour of his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
Proteſtant Subjects of the Valleys of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> at that time when not only
<hi>England,</hi> but <hi>Sweadland, Denmark,</hi> and moſt of the Proteſtant Princes of <hi>Europe</hi>
had done the ſame.</p>
            <p>But this Patronizing Spirit for the Proteſtant Intereſt, which was ſo conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
famous even in a Woman, a Princeſs of this Nation, was not ſuffered to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay
in the hearts of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> People it ſelf during that unhappy abſence of your
Majeſty from your Kingdom, for amidſt their Civil Diſtractions, they forgot not
the right our Nation had to Mediate and ſuccour their <hi>French</hi> Brethren of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Religion; For, beſides Letters and Meſſages they ſent for their preſent
ſolid Relief twenty thouſand two hundred thirty three pounds by Sir <hi>Samuel Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
as part of a General Collection made for them throughout <hi>England,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
remained in ready Caſh, ſixteen thouſand three hundred thirty three pound ten
ſhillings to be improved for them; and we know in whoſe hands this Sum was depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
at your Majeſties happy Reſtoration, but ſince it is ſo ſcattered, that few knows
what is become of it, which is a thing that we humbly beg your Majeſty and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
to give order to inquire into, who they were that laid Sacrilegious hands on
ſuch an holy offering of the Nations to the indigent members of Chriſt in Foraign
Churches. The French Church in <hi>London</hi> have a Procuration to receive it
for the <hi>Piedmontoes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In Fine, both divine and Humane Reaſons do clearly demonſtrate, That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb facs="tcp:100016:3"/>
temporizing Pſeudo-Polititians may inſinuate, nothing would (as it is preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med)
ſo much ſtrengthen your Majeſty at home and abroad, as to give all poſſible
proofs to your Neighbours, that you roundly and vigorouſly intend to ſhew your ſelf
<hi>The Head of the Proteſtant Religion,</hi> and that you will appear to be <hi>Defender
of the Faith indeed.</hi> And certainly the oppoſite Intereſt (God be thanked) does
ſo viſibly decay, according to his unſurmountable Decree; That the Proteſtants are
and ſhall be found to be the beſt friends and ſtrongeſt ſupporters your Majeſty may
have, did worldly Prudence it ſelf lead one to make a Choice.</p>
            <p>Now the matter of this Book will afford ſufficient matter for your Royal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
and Protection, and though you ſee here but a rough draught of their Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and a few of the very many Decrees (which I have by me) that were made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them, yet here is as much as may ſatisfy your Majeſty and the World, that
they ſuffer not as evil Doers; as 'tis plain by the Edict of <hi>Nantes</hi> here inſerted,
and their Plea out of it, and other French Laws.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>France</hi> was ſadly diſtracted and disjoynted within it ſelf for many ages upon this
account of Religion, when the Popes Emiſſaries would never ſuffer the poor <hi>Hugue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots</hi>
to live as peaceable Subjects among them, ſtriving (though in vain) utterly to
extirpate and root them out. But all their Devices turned to their own ſhame, and all
their other attempts for the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tling the Peace of that Nation in any other way, ſtill
proved unſucceſsful till this healing Edict called of <hi>Nantes</hi> was Enacted by <hi>Henry</hi>
the Fourth at that City, whereby the free exerciſe of Religion in determined fixed
Places throughout the Nation with ſundry other Priviledges, were allowed to thoſe
of the Reformed Religion. This wrought ſuch a general Unity and Harmony and
ſuch a bleſſing from God upon that Kingdom, that both <hi>Popiſh</hi> Biſhops and <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian</hi>
Profeſsors lived quietly together for about a whole Century, till now of late,
thoſe proud Prelates not induring any Fellows in the Miniſtry, and not content with
the whole Fleece, will have all the room to dilate their Phylacteries, and ſo upon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
ſuperſtitious pretences and jealouſies they drew that King to grant thoſe Decrees
againſt Proteſtants, as oft as he would require Money of their Convocated Clergy.
Thus they firſt of all break the Bonds of Charity and Chriſtian Unity, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
that of the Civil Concord of the Nation, by incroaching upon the Civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
Power of making and executing of Penal Laws, in their Courts againſt
their Fellow Chriſtians; wherein they are Antichriſts Succeſſors, not Chriſts, nor
his Apoſtles: For his Kingdom was not of this World.</p>
            <p>But may it not then be hoped and humbly offered that the ordaining of ſuch ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Edict of <hi>Nantes</hi> here in <hi>England,</hi> would in allowing ſome limited Privileges to
the Non-conformiſts conforming in Fundamentals, (whoſe Principles are not deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
to Monarchy nor Morality) work the ſame good effects here as it did in that
Country, and prevent thoſe further growing Diviſions and Diſtractions in Church
and State. In ſine, both we and the <hi>French</hi> Proteſtants ought in all humble thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to acknowledge the late bountiful relief of your Majeſties, for the conveying
ſome of the moſt indigent Baniſhed <hi>French</hi> Proteſtants into <hi>Carolina,</hi> and giving
them an <hi>Azile</hi> there; but be pleaſed to conſider, that if ſome courſe be not taken to
protect them, rather where they are, that it ſeems no greater pleaſure can be done
to the <hi>French</hi> King nor his Biſhops; for by a too conſiderable tranſportation of
them, the Proteſtant Intereſt in Chriſtendom will grow weaker, and the <hi>French</hi>
and <hi>Popiſh</hi> will become by ſo much the ſtronger, the Ballance of <hi>Europe</hi> ſhall not be
maintained, which may be your Majeſties true Intereſt and Privilege to preſerve;
and beſides, Religion will be made to flee to <hi>America,</hi> while State-Policy calmly looks
on, and inthrones itſelf in its place: therefore the Premiſſes, and the finding out any
other more fit Expedient, is humbly laid at your Majeſties feet, and your Grand
Councils Cenſure and better Deliberation and Reſolve,</p>

and to Come, greeteth. Among the infinite Mercies that God hath
pleaſed to beſtow upon us, that moſt Signal and Remarkable is, his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
given us Power and Strength not to yield to the dreadful Troubles,
Confuſions, and Diſorders, which were found at our coming to this Kingdom, divided
into ſo many Parties and Factions, that the moſt Legitimate was almoſt the leaſt,
enabling us with Conſtancy in ſuch manner to oppoſe the Storm, as in the end to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
it, reducing this Eſtate to Peace and Reſt; For which, to Him alone be given
the Honour and Glory, and us the Grace to acknowledge our obligation, in having
our Labours made uſe of for the accompliſhing ſo good a work, in which it hath
been viſible to all, that we have not only done what was our Duty, and in our Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
but ſomething more than at another time, would (peradventure) have been agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the Dignity we now hold; as in not having more Care, than to have many
times ſo freely expoſed our own Life. And in this great concurrence of weighty and
perillous Affairs, not being able to compoſe all at one and the ſame time, We have
choſen in this order; Firſt to undertake thoſe who were not to be ſuppreſſed but by
force, and rather to remit and ſuſpend others for ſome time, who might be dealt with
by reaſon, and Juſtice: For the general difference among our good Subjects, and the
particular evils of the ſoundeſt parts of the State, we judged might be eaſily cured,
after the Principal cauſe (the continuation of the Civil Wars) was taken away, in
which we have, by the bleſſing of God, well and happily ſucceeded, all Hoſtility and

us in our other affairs, which remain to be compoſed, and that by this means we ſhall
arrive at the eſtabliſhment of a good Peace, with tranquility and reſt, (which hath
ever been the end of all our vows and intentions) as all the reward we deſire or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
for ſo much pains and trouble, as we have taken in the whole courſe of our
Life. Amongſt our ſaid affairs (towards which it behooves us to have patience)
one of the principal hath been, the many complaints we received from divers of our
Provinces and Catholick Cities, for that the exerciſe of the Catholick Religion was
not univerſally re-eſtabliſhed, as is provided by Edicts or Statutes heretofore made
for the Pacification of the Troubles ariſing from Religion; as alſo the Supplications
and Remonſtrances which have been made to us by our Subjects of the reformed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
as well upon the execution of what hath been granted by the ſaid former
Laws, as that they deſire to have ſome addition for the exerciſe of their Religion,
the liberty of their Conſciences and the ſecurity of their Perſons and Fortunes; preſuming
to have juſt reaſons for deſiring ſome inlargement of Articles, as not being without
great apprehenſions, becauſe their Ruine hath been the principal pretext and origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
foundation of the late Wars, Troubles, and Commotions. Now not to burden us
with too much buſineſs at once, as alſo that the fury of War was not compatible
with the eſtabliſhment of Laws, how good ſoever they might be, we have hitherto
deferred from time to time giving remedy herein. But now that it hath pleaſed God
to give us a beginning of enjoying ſome Reſt, we think we cannot imploy our ſelf
better, than to apply to that which may tend to the glory and ſervice of his holy
name, and to provide that he may be adored and prayed unto by all our Subjects: and
if it hath not yet pleaſed him to permit it to be in one and the ſame form of Religion,
that it may at the leaſt be with one and the ſame intention, and with ſuch rules
that may prevent amongſt them all troubles and tumults: and that we and
this Kingdom may alwayes conſerve the glorious title of moſt Chriſtian, which
hath been by ſo much merit ſo long ſince acquired, and by the ſame means take away
the cauſe of miſchief and trouble, which may happen from the Actions of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
which of all others are moſt prevalent and penetrating. For this cauſe, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
this affair to be of the greateſt importance, and worthy of the beſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
after having conſidered the papers of complaints of our Catholick ſubjects, and
having alſo permitted to our Subjects of the Reformed Religion to aſſemble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
by Deputies, for framing their complaints, and making a collection of all their
Remonſtrances; and having thereupon conferred divers times with them, viewing the
precedent Laws, we have upon the whole judged it neceſſary to give to all our ſaid
Subjects one general Law, Clear, Pure, and Abſolute, by which they ſhall be regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
in all differences which have heretofore riſen among them, or may hereafter
riſe, wherewith the one and other may be contented, being framed according as the
time requires: and having had no other regard in this deliberation than ſolely the
Zeal we have to the ſervice of God, praying that he would henceforward render to
all our ſubjects a durable and Eſtabliſhed peace. Upon which we implore and expect
from his divine bounty the ſame protection and favour, as he hath alwayes viſibly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
upon this Kingdom from our Birth, during the many years we have attained unto,
and give our ſaid Subjects the grace to underſtand, that in obſervation of this our
Ordinance conſiſteth (after that which is their duty toward God and us) the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
foundation of their Union, Concord, Tranquility, Reſt, and the Re-eſtabliſhment
of all this Eſtate in its firſt ſplendor, opulency and ſtrength. As on our part we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
to cauſe all to be exactly obſerved, without ſuffering any contradiction. And
for theſe cauſes, having with the advice of the Princes of our Blood, other Princes
and Officers of our Crown, and other great and eminent Perſons of our Council of
State, being near us, well and diligently weighed and conſidered all this affair; We
have by this Edict or Statute perpetuall and irrevocable ſaid, declared, and ordained,
ſaying, declaring, and ordaining;</p>
            <p>1. That the memory of all things paſſed on the one part and the other, ſince the
beginning of the month of <hi>March,</hi> 1585. untill our coming to the Crown, and alſo
during the other precedent troubles, and the occaſion of the ſame, ſhall remain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed
and ſuppreſſed, as things that had never been. And it ſhall not be Lawfull
or permitted to our Attorneys General, nor other perſon or perſons whatſoever, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
or private, in any time, or for any occaſion whatſoever it may be, to make mention
thereof, Proceſs or Proſecution in any Courts or Juriſdiction whatſoever.</p>
            <p>2. We prohibit to all our Subjects of what State and Condition ſoever they be, to
renew the memory thereof, to attaque, reſent, injure, or provoke one the other by
reproaches for what is paſt, under any pretext or cauſe whatſoever, by diſputing,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100016:4"/>
conteſting, quarrelling, reviling, or offending by factious words; but to contain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and live peaceably together as Brethren, Friends, and fellow-Citizens, upon
penalty for acting to the contrary, to be puniſhed for breakers of Peace, and diſturbers
of the publick quiet.</p>
            <p>3. We ordain, that the Catholick Religion ſhall be reſtored and re-eſtabliſhed in all
places, and quarters of this Kingdom and Countrey under our obedience, and where
the exerciſe of the ſame hath been intermitted, to be there again, peaceably and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
exerciſed without any trouble or impediment. Moſt expreſly prohibiting all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of what State, Quality or Condition ſoever, upon the penalties before-mentioned
not to trouble, moleſt, or diſquiet the Eccleſiaſticks in the celebration of Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
injoyning of receiving of Tythes, the fruits and Revenues of their Benefices, and
all other Rights and Duties belonging to them: and we command, that all thoſe who
during the troubles, have invaded Churches, Houſes, Goods, and Revenues belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
to the Eccleſiaſticks, and thoſe who detain and poſſeſs them, to deliver over to
them the intire poſſeſſion thereof with a peaceable enjoyment, and with ſuch rights,
liberties, and ſecurity as they had before they were deſeized. Moſt expreſly forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to thoſe of the Reformed Religion, to Preach or exerciſe their ſaid Religion in
the Churches, Houſes, and habitations of the ſaid Eccleſiaſticks.</p>
            <p>4. It ſhall be the choice of the ſaid Eccleſiaſticks to buy the Houſes and Structures
built upon their ground in profane places, and made uſe of againſt their wills during
the troubles, or compell the poſſeſſors of the ſaid buildings to buy the ground according
to the eſtimation that ſhall be made by skilfull perſons, agreed upon by both Parties:
And to come the better to an agreement, the Judges of the place ſhall provide ſuch for
them, except the ſaid Poſſeſſors will try the Title to whom the places in queſtion belong.
And where the ſaid Eccleſiaſticks ſhall compell the poſſeſſors to buy the ground, the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe-money
if of eſtimation, ſhall not be put in their hands, but ſhall remain charged
in the poſſeſſors hands, to make profit thereof at five <hi>per Cent.</hi> untill it ſhall be imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the profit of the Church, which ſhall be done within a Year. And after that
time, if the Purchaſer will not continue any longer at the ſaid intereſt, he ſhall be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
thereof by conſigning the money to a reſponſible perſon, with the authority
of the Juſtice. And for ſuch places as are Sacred, advice ſhall be given therein by the
Commiſſioners who ſhall be ordained for the execution of the preſent Edict, for which
we ſhall provide.</p>
            <p>5. Nevertheleſs the ground and foundation of places uſed for the reparation and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification
of Cities and places in our Kingdom, and the materials imployed therein, may
not be ſold nor taken away by the Eccleſiaſticks, or other perſons publick or private,
untill the ſaid reparations and fortifications ſhall by our order be demoliſhed.</p>
            <p>6. And not to leave any occaſion of trouble and difference among our Subjects, we
have permitted and do permit to thoſe of the Reformed Riligion, to live and dwell
in all the Cities and places of this our Kingdom and Countreys under our obedience,
without being inquired after, vexed, moleſted, or compelled to do any thing in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
contrary to their Conſcience, nor by reaſon of the ſame be ſearched after in
houſes or places where they live, they comporting themſelves in other things as is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in this our preſent Edict or Statute.</p>
            <p>7. We alſo permit to all Lords, Gentlemen and other Perſons, as well inhabitants
as others, making profeſſion of the Reformed Religion, having in our Kingdom and
Countreys under our obedience, high Juſtice as chief Lord (as in <hi>Normandy</hi>) be it
in propriety or uſage, in whole, moiety, or third part, to have in ſuch of their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of the ſaid high Juſtice or Fiefs, as aboveſaid (which they ſhall be obliged to No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
for their principall reſidence to our Bayliffs and chief Juſtice each in their juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction)
the exerciſe of the ſaid Religion as long as they are Reſident there, and in
their abſence, their wives or families, or part of the ſame. And though the right of
Juſtice or whole Fief be controverted; nevertheleſs the exerciſe of the ſaid Religion
ſhall be allowed there, provided that the aboveſaid be in actual poſſeſſion of the ſaid
high Juſtice, though our Attorney Generall be a Party. We permitting them alſo to
have the ſaid exerciſe in their other houſes of high Juſtice or Fiefs aboveſaid, ſo
long as they ſhall be preſent, and not otherwiſe: and all, as well for them, their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
and ſubjects, as others that ſhall go thither.</p>
            <p>8. In the Houſes that are Fiefs, where thoſe of the ſaid Religion have not high
Juſtice, there the ſaid Exerciſe of the Reformed Religion ſhall not be permitted, ſave
only to their own Families, yet nevertheleſs, if other perſons, to the number of thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
beſides their Families, ſhall be there upon the occaſion of Chriſtenings, Viſits
of their Friends, or otherwiſe, our meaning is, that in ſuch caſe they ſhall not be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſted:
provided alſo, that the ſaid Houſes be not within Cities, Burroughs, or Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100016:5"/>
belonging to any Catholick Lord (ſave to us) having high Juſtice, in which the
ſaid Catholick Lords have their Houſes. For in ſuch caſes, thoſe of the ſaid Religion
ſhall not hold the ſaid Exerciſe in the ſaid Cities, Burroughs, or Villages, except by
permiſſion of the ſaid Lords high Juſtices.</p>
            <p>9. We permit alſo to thoſe of the ſaid Religion to hold, and continue the Exerciſe of
the ſame in all the Cities and Places under our obedience, where it hath by them been E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed
and made publick by many and divers times, in the Year 1586, and in 1597,
until the end of the Month of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> notwithſtanding all Decrees and Judgements
whatſoever to the contrary.</p>
            <p>10. In like manner the ſaid Exerciſe may be Eſtabliſhed, and re-eſtabliſhed in all the
Cities and Places where it hath been eſtabliſhed, or ought to be by the Statute of Pacifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
made in the Year 1577, the particular Articles and Conferences of <hi>Nerat</hi> and
<hi>Fleux,</hi> without hindering the Eſtabliſhment in places of Domain, granted by the ſaid
Statutes, Articles, and Conferences for the Place of Bailiwicks, or which ſhall be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
though they have been alienated to Catholicks, or ſhall be in the future. Not
underſtanding nevertheleſs that the ſaid Exerciſe may be re-eſtabliſhed in the Places of
the ſaid Domain, which have been heretofore poſſeſſed by thoſe of the ſaid Reformed
Religion, which hath been in conſideration of their perſons, or becauſe of the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
of Fiefs, if the ſaid Fiefs are found at preſent poſſeſſed by perſons of the ſaid Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Religion.</p>
            <p>11. Furthermore, in each ancient Bailiwick, Juriſdiction and Government, holding
place of a Bailiwick with an immediate Appeal (without mediation) to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
We ordain, that in the Suburbs of a City, beſides that which hath been agreed to
them by the ſaid Statute, particular Articles and Conferences; and where it is not a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
in a Burrough or Village, the Exerciſe of the ſaid Reformed Religion may be
publickly held for all ſuch as will come, though the ſaid Bailiwicks, chief Juriſdictions
and Governments have many places where the ſaid Exerciſe is eſtabliſhed, except, and
be excepted the Bailiwick, new created by the preſent Edict or Law, the Cities in
which are Arch-Biſhops and Biſhops, where nevertheleſs thoſe of the ſaid Reformed
Religion are not for that reaſon deprived of having power to demand and nominate for
the ſaid Exerciſe certain Borroughs and Villages near the ſaid Cities: except alſo the
Signories belonging to the Eccleſiaſticks, in which we do not underſtand, that the ſecond
place of Bailiwicks may be eſtabliſhed, thoſe being excepted and reſerved. We under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
under the name of ancient Bailiwicks, ſuch as were in the time of the deceaſed
King <hi>Henry,</hi> our moſt Honoured Lord and Father in Law, held for Bailiwicks, chief
Juſtice-ſhips and Governments, appealing without interceſſion to our ſaid Courts.</p>
            <p>12. We don't underſtand by this preſent Statute, to derogate from the Laws and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greements
heretofore made for the Reduction of any Prince, Lord, Gentleman, or
Catholick City under our Obedience, in that which concerns the Exerciſe of the ſaid Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
the which Laws and Records ſhall be kept and obſerved upon that account, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as ſhall be contained in the Inſtructions given the Commiſſioners for the execution
of the preſent Edict or Law.</p>
            <p>13. We prohibit moſt expreſly to all thoſe of the ſaid Religion, to hold any Exerciſe
of the ſame as well by Miniſters preaching, diſcipling of Pupils, or publick inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Children, as otherways, in this our Kingdom or Countries under our Obedience,
in that which concerns Religion, except in the places permitted and granted by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Edict or Law.</p>
            <p>14. As alſo not to exerciſe the ſaid Religion in our Court, nor in our Territories
and Countries beyond the Mountains, nor in our City of <hi>Paris,</hi> nor within five Leagues
of the ſaid City: nevertheleſs thoſe of the ſaid Religion dwelling in the ſaid Lands
and Countries beyond the Mountains, and in our ſaid City, and within five Leagues about
the ſame, ſhall not be ſearched after in their Houſes, nor conſtrained to do any thing in
Religion againſt their Conſciences, comporting themſelves in all other things according
as is contained in our preſent Edict or Law.</p>
            <p>15. Nor alſo ſhall hold publick Exerciſe of the ſaid Religion in the Armies, except in
the Quarters of the principal Commanders, who make profeſſion of the ſame, except
nevertheleſs where the Quarters of our perſon ſhall be.</p>
            <p>16. Following the ſecond Article of the Conference of <hi>Nerat,</hi> we grant to thoſe of
the ſaid Religion power to build Places for the Exerciſe of the ſame, in Cities and Places
where it is granted them, and that thoſe ſhall be rendered to them which they have
heretofore built, or the Foundations of the ſame in the condition as they are at preſent,
even in places where the ſaid Exerciſe was not permitted to them, except they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
into another nature of Building: In which caſe there ſhall be given to them by
the Poſſeſſors of the ſaid Buildings, other Houſes and Places of the ſame value that they
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100016:5"/>
were before they were built, or the juſt eſtimation of the ſame, according to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of experienced perſons, ſaving to the ſaid Proprietors and Poſſeſſors, their
Tryal at Law to whom they ſhall belong.</p>
            <p>17. We prohibit all Preachers, Readers, and others who ſpeak in publick, to uſe any
words, diſcourſe, or propoſitions tending to excite the People to Sedition; and we
injoin them to contain and comport themſelves modeſtly, and to ſay nothing which ſhall
not be for the inſtruction and edification of the Auditors, and maintaining the peace
and tranquillity eſtabliſhed by us in our ſaid Kingdom, upon the penalties mentioned
in the precedent Statutes. Expreſly injoyning our Attourney Generals, and their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes,

anſwering therefore, and the loſs of their Office.</p>
            <p>18. Forbidding alſo to our Subjects, of what Quality and Condition ſoever they be,
to take away by force or inducement, againſt the will of their Parents, the Children of
the ſaid Religion, to Baptize or Confirm them in the Catholick Church; as alſo we
forbid the ſame to thoſe of the ſaid Reformed Religion upon pain of being exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
puniſhed.</p>
            <p>19. Thoſe of the Reformed Religion ſhall not be at all conſtrained, nor remain o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged
by reaſon of Abjurations, Promiſes, and Oaths, which they have heretofore
made, or by caution given concerning the practice of the ſaid Religion, nor ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be moleſted or proſecuted in any ſort whatſoever.</p>
            <p>20. They ſhall alſo be obliged to keep and obſerve the Feſtivals of the Catholick
Church, and ſhall not on the ſame dayes work, ſell, or keep open ſhop, nor likewiſe
the Artiſans ſhall not work out of their ſhops, in their chambers or houſes privately on
the ſaid Feſtivals, and other dayes forbidden, of any trade, the noiſe whereof may be
heard without by thoſe that paſs by, or by the Neighbours: the ſearching after which
ſhall notwithſtanding be made by none but by the Officers of Juſtice.</p>
            <p>21. Books concerning the ſaid Reformed Religion ſhall not be printed or ſold pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly,
ſave in the Cities and places where the publick exerciſe of the ſaid Religion
is permitted. And for other Books which ſhall be printed in other Cities, they ſhall
be viewed and viſited by our Theological Officers, as is directed by our ordinances.
Forbidding moſt expreſly the printing, publiſhing, and ſelling of all Books, Libells,
and writings defamatory, upon the penalties contained in our Ordinances, injoyning
all our Judges and Officers to ſeize the ſame.</p>
            <p>22. We ordain, that there ſhall not be made any difference or diſtinction upon the
account of the ſaid Religion, in receiving Scholars to be inſtructed in the Univerſities,
Colledges, or Schools, nor of the ſick or poor into Hoſpitals, ſick houſes or publick
Almshouſes.</p>
            <p>23. Thoſe of the Reformed Religion ſhall be obliged to obſerve the Laws of the
Catholick Church, received in this our Kingdom, as to Marriages and Contracts, and
to contract in the degrees of conſanguinity and affinity.</p>
            <p>24. In like manner thoſe of the ſaid Religion ſhall pay the rights of Entry, as is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed
for Offices unto which they ſhall be choſen, without being conſtrained to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
or aſſiſt in any Ceremonies contrary to their ſaid Religion: and being called to

            <p>25. We Will and Ordain, that all thoſe of the Reformed Religion, and others
who have followed their party, of what State, Quality or Condition ſoever they be,
ſhall be obliged and conſtrained by all due and reaſonable wayes, and under the penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
contained in the ſaid Edict or Statute relating thereunto, to pay tythes to the
Curates, and other Eccleſiaſticks, and to all others to whom they ſhall appertain, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the uſage and cuſtom of the places.</p>
            <p>26. Diſinheritations of Privations, be it in diſpoſition in life-time or Teſtimentary,
made from hatred only, or for Religion ſake, ſhall have no place neither for the time
paſſed or to come among our Subjects.</p>
            <p>27. To the end to re-unite ſo much the better the minds and good will of our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
as is our intention, and to take away all complaints for the future; We declare
all thoſe who make or ſhall make profeſſion of the ſaid Reformed Religion, to be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of holding and exerciſing all Eſtates, Dignities, Offices, and publick charges
whatſoever, Royal, Signioral, or of Cities of our Kingdom, Countreys, Lands and
Lordſhips under our obedience, notwithſtanding all Oaths to the contrary, and to be
indifferently admitted and received into the ſame, and our Court of Parliament and
other Judges ſhall content themſelves with informing and inquiring after the lives,
manners, Religion and honeſt Converſation of thoſe that were or ſhall be preferred to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100016:6"/>
ſuch offices, as well of the one Religion as the other, without taking other Oath
of them than for the good and faithful ſervice of the King in the exerciſe of their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
and to keep the Ordinances, as they have been obſerved in all times. Alſo va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancies
hapning of ſuch of the ſaid Eſtates, Charges, and offices as ſhall be in our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
they ſhall be provided by us indifferently, and without diſtinction of Perſons,
as that which tends to the Union of our Subjects. Underſtanding likewiſe that thoſe
of the Reformed Religion may be admitted and received into all Councells, Delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Aſſemblies, and Functions depending upon the aboveſaid things, without being
rejected or hindred the injoyment thereof by reaſon of the ſaid Religion.</p>
            <p>28. We ordain for the interrment of the dead of the ſaid Religion throughout the
Cities and places of this Kingdom, that there ſhall in each place be provided for them
by our Officers and Magiſtrates, and by the Commiſſioners that we ſhall depute for the
execution of our preſent Edict or Statute, a place the moſt Commodious that can
be: and the burying places which they have had heretofore, and whereof they have
by the troubles been deprived, ſhall be reſtored unto them, except they be found to be
converted into buildings of what quality or kind ſoever it be, in which caſe a compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
ſhall be made another way.</p>
            <p>29. We enjoyn moſt expreſly our officers to look to it, that no ſcandal be given
in the ſaid interrments, and they ſhall be obliged within fifteen dayes after requeſt made,
to provide thoſe of the ſaid Religion with convenient places for Sepulchres, without
delay, upon penalty of five hundred Crowns in their own proper and private
names. And it is alſo forbidden, as well to the ſaid officers as to all others, to exact
any thing for the conduct of the ſaid dead bodies upon penalty of Extortion.</p>
            <p>30. To the end that Juſtice be given and adminiſtred to our Subjects, without any
ſuſpition, hatred or favour, as being one of the principal means for the maintaining
Peace and Concord, we have ordained and do ordain, that in our Court of Parliament
of <hi>Paris</hi> ſhall be eſtabliſhed a Chamber, compoſed of a Preſident and ſixteen Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors
of the ſaid Parliament, which ſhall be called and entituled the Chamber of Edict,
and ſhall take cogniſance not only of the Cauſes and Proceſs of the ſaid Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Religion which ſhall be within the juriſdiction of the ſaid Court; but alſo of the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals

ſhall be hereafter given to it by this preſent Edict or Statute and that until in each of the
ſaid Parliaments, there ſhall be eſtabliſhed a Chamber for rendring Juſtice upon the place.
We ordain alſo, That of four Offices of councellors in our ſaid Parliament, remaining of the

Preſident and Councellors ſhall be by us choſen and taken out of the body of our

of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> or at <hi>Nerat,</hi> and that of <hi>Dauphine</hi> at <hi>Grenoble.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>32. The Chamber of <hi>Dauphine</hi> ſhall take Cognizance of the Cauſes of thoſe of the
Reformed Religion within the juriſdiction of our Parliament of <hi>Province,</hi> without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
need of Letters of Evocation, or Appeal, or other Proviſions, than in our Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery

not be obliged to take Letters of Evocation or Appeal, nor other Proviſion than in our
Chancery of <hi>Paris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>33. Our Subjects of the Reformed Religion of the Parliament of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> ſhall
have the choice to Plead in the Chamber ordained in the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> or in

            <p>34. All the ſaid ſeveral Chambers compoſed as is ſaid, ſhall have Cogniſance, and by
decree ſhall Judge in Soveraignty and laſt Appeal, excluſive to all others, the Proceſs

demains of the Church; all which ſhall be tryed and Judged in the Courts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
excluſive to the ſaid Chambers of Edict. As alſo we will and require that as to
Judging and deciding the Criminal Proceſs which may happen betwixt the ſaid Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticks
and thoſe of the Reformed Religion, that if the Eccleſiaſticks are defendant
in ſuch caſe, Recognizance and Judgment of criminal Proceſs ſhall belong to our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
Courts diſtinct as to the ſaid Chamber; and where the Eccleſiaſticks ſhall be
Plaintiff, and one of the Reformed Religion Defendant, the Cognizance and Judgment of
Criminal Proceſs ſhall belong in laſt Appeal to the ſaid Chambers eſtabliſhed. And we
acknowledge alſo the ſaid Chambers in time of Vacations for matters attributed by the
Edicts and Ordinances to belong to the ſaid Chambers eſtabliſhed for times of Vacation,
each within his Juriſdiction.</p>
            <p>35. The Chamber of <hi>Grenoble</hi> ſhall be from henceforward united and incorporated
into the body of the ſaid Court of Parliament, and the Preſident and Councellors of
the Reformed Religion ſhall be called Preſident and Councellors of the ſaid Court,
and hold the rank and number of the ſame, and to this end ſhall be firſt diſtributed
through the other Chambers, and then drawn from them to be imployed and ſerve in that
which we now ordain of new, with condition nevertheleſs, that they ſhall aſſiſt and
have voice and ſeſſion in all the deliberations which the Chamber aſſembled ſhall have,
and ſhall enjoy the ſame Sallary, authority and preheminence which the other Preſidents
and Councellors of the ſaid Courts do enjoy.</p>
            <p>36. We will and ordain, that the ſaid Chamber of <hi>Caſtres</hi> and <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> be united
and incorporated in the ſame Parliaments, in the ſame manner and form as others:
and when need ſhall require, and that the Cauſes which have moved us to make this
eſtabliſhment ſhall ceaſe, and ſhall not have any more place among our Subjects; then
ſhall the Preſidents and Councellors of the ſame, of the ſaid Reformed Religion, be held
for Preſidents and Councellors of the ſaid Courts.</p>
            <p>37. There ſhall alſo be a new creation or erection in the Chamber ordained in the
Parliament of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> of two ſubſtitutes for our Procurators, or Attorneys and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates
Generall, whereof one ſhall be Catholick, and the other of the Reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
which ſhall have the ſaid Offices with competent Sallaries.</p>
            <p>38. Theſe ſubſtitutes ſhall not aſſume other qualities than that of ſubſtitutes; and
when the Chambers or Courts ordained for the Parliaments of <hi>Tholouſe</hi> and <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi>
ſhall be united and incorporated to the ſaid Parliaments, the ſaid Subſtitutes ſhall have the
Office of Councellors in the ſame.</p>
            <p>39. The diſpatches of the Chancery of <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> ſhall be peruſed in the preſence of
two Councellors of the ſame Chamber, whereof one ſhall be a Catholick, and the other
of the Reformed Religion. In the abſence of one of the Maſters of Requeſt of our
Pallace, one of the Notaries and Secretaries of the ſaid Court of Parliament of <hi>Bourde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aux,</hi>
ſhall be Reſident in the place where the ſaid Chamber ſhall be eſtabliſhed, or elſe
one of the ordinary Secretaries of the Chancery to ſign the diſpatches of the ſaid Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery.</p>
            <p>40. We will and ordain, that in the ſaid Chamber of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> there ſhall be two Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
of the Regiſter of the ſaid Parliament, the one Civil and the other Criminal,
who ſhall exerciſe their Offices by our Commiſſions, and ſhall be called Commiſſioners to
the Regiſter Civil and Criminal; but nevertheleſs ſhall not be revoked by the Regiſters of
the Parliament, yet ſhall be accountable for the profits of the Offices to the ſaid Regiſters,
which Commiſſioners ſhall be Sallaried by the ſaid Regiſters as the ſaid Chamber ſhall think
fit to appoint, there ſhall be ordained ſome Catholick Meſſengers, who ſhall be taken in the
ſaid Court or elſewhere, according to our pleaſure; beſides which, there ſhall alſo be
two <hi>de novo</hi> freely choſen of the Reformed Religion: And all the ſaid Meſſengers, or
Door-keepers ſhall be regulated by the ſaid Chamber or Court, as well in the exerciſe
of their Offices as in the Profits or Fees which they ſhall take. There ſhall alſo be a
Commiſſion diſpatched for payment of Sallaries and receiving of Americaments of the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100016:7"/>
ſaid Court, which ſhall be ſuch as we ſhall pleaſe to appoint. If the ſaid Chamber ſhall
be eſtabliſhed in other place than the ſaid City, the Commiſſion heretofore agreed for
paying the Sallaries of the Chamber of <hi>Caſtres,</hi> ſhall go out in its full and intire effect,
and there ſhall be joyned to the ſaid Office, the Commiſſion for the receipt of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merciaments
of the ſaid Court.</p>
            <p>41. There ſhall be provided good and ſufficient aſſignations for the Sallaries of the
Officers of the Chambers ordained by this Edict.</p>
            <p>42. The Preſidents, Councellors, and other Catholick Officers of the ſaid Chambers
or Courts, ſhall be continued ſo long as we ſhall ſee it to be for our ſervice, and the
good of our Subjects: And in the diſmiſſing any of them others ſhall be admitted in
their places, before their departure, they having no power during their Service to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part,
or be abſent from the ſaid Chambers, without the leave of the ſame, which ſhall
be judged of according to the Ordinance.</p>
            <p>43. The ſaid Chambers or Courts Mypartis ſhall be eſtabliſhed within ſix Months,
during which (if the eſtabliſhment ſhall be ſo long in doing) the Proceſs commenced,
and to be commenced, where thoſe of the Religion ſhall be parties within the juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of our Parliaments of <hi>Paris, Rouen, Dyon</hi> and <hi>Rennes,</hi> ſhall be preſently removed
to the Chamber or Court eſtabliſhed at <hi>Paris,</hi> by vertue of the Edict of 1577. or elſe
to the great Councell at the Election of thoſe of the ſaid Religion if they require it:
and thoſe which ſhall be of the Parliament of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> to the Chamber or Court eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
at <hi>Caſtres,</hi> or to the ſaid grand Councell at their Election, and thoſe which ſhall
be of <hi>Provence</hi> to the Parliament of <hi>Grenoble.</hi> And if the ſaid Chambers, or Courts,
are not eſtabliſhed within three Months after the preſentation of our Edict that Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which ſhall make refuſal thereof, ſhall be prohibited the Cognizance and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the cauſes of thoſe of the Religion.</p>
            <p>44. The Proceſs not yet judged, depending in the ſaid Courts of Parliaments and
great Counſel of the quality aboveſaid, ſhall be ſent back in what Eſtate ſoever they
be, to the ſaid Chambers or Courts, each within his juriſdiction, if one of the Parties
of the Religion require it within four Months after the Eſtabliſhment of the ſame;
and as to thoſe which ſhall be diſcontinued, and are not in condition of being judged,
thoſe of the ſaid Religion ſhall be obliged to make Declaration upon the firſt intimation
and ſignification to them of the Proſecution, and the time paſt ſhall not be underſtood
to require the diſmiſſion.</p>
            <p>45. The ſaid Chambers (or Courts) of <hi>Grenoble</hi> and <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> as alſo that of
<hi>Caſtres,</hi> ſhall keep the forms and ſtile of Parliament, where the juriſdiction of the
ſame ſhall be eſtabliſhed, and ſhall judge by equal numbers of the one and the other
Religion, if the Parties conſent not to the Contrary.</p>
            <p>46. All the Judges to whom the Addreſs ſhall be made for execution of Decrees,
Commiſſions of the ſaid Chambers, and Patents obtained in Chancery for the ſame, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with all the Meſſengers and Serjeants, ſhall be obliged to put them in execution,
and the ſaid Meſſengers and Serjeants ſhall do all Acts throughout our Kingdom, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
demanding a Placet, or peremptory Warrant, upon penalty of ſuſpenſion of their
Eſtates, and of the expenſes, damages and intereſts of the Parties, the Cognizance
whereof ſhall belong to the ſaid Chambers.</p>
            <p>47. No removal of cauſes ſhall be allowed to any whereof the Cognizance is attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
to the ſaid Chambers, except in caſes of Ordinance, the removal by which ſhall be
made to the next Chamber eſtabliſhed according to our Edict. And the dividing of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of the ſame Chambers ſhall be judged by the neareſt, obſerving the proportion and
forms of the ſaid Chambers, where the Proceſs ſhall be proceeded upon; except the
Chamber of Edict in our Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> where the Proceſs divided ſhall be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed
in the ſame Chamber by the Judges, which ſhall be by us named by our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Letters Patents for that effect, if the parties had not rather wait the removing
of the ſaid Chamber. And happening that one and the ſame Proceſs be divided in all
the Chambers, <hi>Myparty,</hi> or half on Religion, half th'other, the diviſion ſhall be ſent
to the Chamber of <hi>Paris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>48. The refuſal that ſhall be propoſed againſt the Preſidents and Councellors of the
Chambers, half one Religion and half the other, called the Court of Edict, may be
judged by the number of ſix, to which number the parties ſhall be obliged to reſtrain
themſelves, otherwiſe they ſhall be paſſed over without having regard to the ſaid Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal.</p>
            <p>49. The examinations of the Preſidents and Councellors newly erected in the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Edict, <hi>Mypartis,</hi> ſhall be made in our privy Council, or by the ſaid Chambers
each in his Precinct, when they ſhall be a ſufficient number; and nevertheleſs the Oath
accuſtomed ſhall be by them taken in the Courts where the ſaid Chambers ſhall be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100016:7"/>
and upon refuſal, in our Privy-Council: except thoſe of the Chamber of
<hi>Languedoc,</hi> in which they ſhall take Oath before our Chancellor, or in the ſame Chamber.</p>
            <p>50. We Will and Ordain, That the reception of our Officers of the ſaid Religion,
judged in the ſaid Chambers half Papiſt and half of the Reformed Religion by Plurali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Voices, as is accuſtomed in other Courts, without being needfull that the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
ſurpaſs two thirds, following the ordinance which for the ſame cauſe is abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated.</p>
            <p>51. There ſhall be made in the ſaid Chambers Mypartis, the Propoſitions, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberations,
and Reſolutions which ſhall appertain to the publick Peace, and for the
particular State and Policy of the Cities where the ſame Chambers ſhall be.</p>
            <p>52. The Article for the juriſdiction of the ſaid Chambers ordained by the preſent
Edict, ſhall be followed and obſerved according to its form and tenure, even in that
which concerns the execution or breach of our Edict, when thoſe of the Religion ſhall
be Parties.</p>
            <p>53. The Kings ſubordinate Officers, or others whereof the reception belongeth to
our Courts of Parliament, if they be of the Reformed Religion, they may be examined and
received in the ſaid Chambers, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe under the juriſdiction of the Parliaments of
<hi>Paris, Normandy</hi> and <hi>Bretagne,</hi> in the ſaid Chambers of <hi>Paris;</hi> thoſe of <hi>Dauphine</hi> and
<hi>Provence,</hi> in the Chamber of <hi>Grenoble;</hi> thoſe of <hi>Burgundy</hi> in the ſaid Chamber of <hi>Paris,</hi>
or <hi>Dauphine,</hi> at their choice; thoſe under the juriſdiction of <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> in the Chamber
of <hi>Caſtres;</hi> and thoſe of the Parliament of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> in the Chamber of <hi>Guyenne;</hi>
without that others may oppoſe themſelves againſt their reception; and render them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
Parties, as our procurators General and their Subſtitutes, and thoſe enjoying the
ſaid Offices: Yet nevertheleſs the accuſtomed Oath ſhall be by them taken in the Courts
of Parliaments, who ſhall not take any Cognizance of the ſaid receptions; and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal
of the ſaid Parliaments, the ſaid Officers ſhall take the Oath in the ſaid Chambers; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which ſo taken, they ſhall be obliged to preſent by a Meſſenger or Notary, the
Act of their reception, to the Regiſter of the ſaid Courts of Parliaments, and to leave
a coppy thereof examined by the ſaid Regiſter, who is enjoyned to Regiſter the ſaid
Acts, upon penalty of all the expence, dammage and intereſt of the Parties; and the
Regiſters refuſing to do it, ſhall ſuffer the ſaid Officers to report the Act of the ſaid
Summons, diſpatched by the ſaid Meſſengers or Notaries, and cauſe the ſame to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtred
in the Regiſter-Office of their ſaid Juriſdiction, for to have recourſe thereunto
when need ſhall be, upon penalty of Nullity of their proceedings and Judgments. And
as to the Officers, whereof the reception hath not been accuſtomed to be made in our
ſaid Parliaments, in caſe thoſe to whom it belongs ſhall refuſe to proceed to the ſaid
examination and reception, then the ſaid Officers ſhall repair to the ſaid Chambers for
to be there provided as it ſhall appertain.</p>
            <p>54. The Officers of the ſaid Reformed Religion, who ſhall hereafter be appointed
to ſerve in the body of our ſaid Courts of Parliaments, grand Counſell, Chambers of
Accompts, Courts of Aids, Officers of the general Treaſuries of <hi>France,</hi> and other
Officers of the Exchequer, ſhall be examined and received in places where they have
been accuſtomed, and in caſe of refuſal or denying of Juſtice, they ſhall be appointed
by our Privy Councel.</p>
            <p>55. The reception of our Officers made in the Chamber heretofore eſtabliſhed at
<hi>Caſtres,</hi> ſhall remain valid notwithſtanding all Decrees and Ordinances to the contrary.
And ſhall be alſo valid, the reception of Judges, Councellors, Aſſiſtants, and other
Officers of the ſaid Religion made in our Privy-Councill, or by Commiſſioners by us
ordained in caſe of the refuſal of our Courts of Parliaments, Courts of Aids, and
Chambers of Accompts, even as if they were done in the ſaid Courts and Chambers,
and by the other Judges to whom the reception belongeth. And their Sallaries ſhall be
allowed them by the Chambers of Accompt without difficulty; and if any have been
put out, they ſhall be eſtabliſhed without need of any other command than the preſent
Edict, and without that the ſaid Officer ſhall be obliged to ſhew any other reception,
notwithſtanding all Decrees given to the contrary which ſhall remain null and of none
effect.</p>
            <p>56. In the mean time untill the charges of the Juſtice of the ſaid Chambers can be
defrayed by Amerciaments, there ſhall be provided by us by valuable aſſignations ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for maintaining the ſaid charges, without expecting to do it by the Goods of the
Condemned.</p>
            <p>57. The Preſidents and Councellors of the Reformed Religion heretofore received
in our Court of Parliament of <hi>Dauphine,</hi> and in the Chamber of Edict incorporated in
the ſame, ſhall continue and have their Seſſion and Orders for the ſame; that is to ſay,
Preſidents, as they have injoyed, and do injoy at preſent, and the Councellors according
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100016:8"/>
to the Decrees and Proviſions that they have heretofore obteined in our Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel.</p>
            <p>58. We declare all Sentences, Judgments, Procedures, Seiſures, Sales, and Decrees
made and given againſt thoſe of the Reformed Religion, as well living as dead, from
the death of the deceaſed King <hi>Henry</hi> the Second our moſt honoured Lord and Father
in Law, upon the occaſion of the ſaid Religion, Tumults and Troubles ſince hapning,
as alſo the execution of the ſame Judgments and Decrees, from henceforward cancelled,
revoked, and anulled. And we ordain, that they ſhall be eaſed and taken out of the
Regiſters Office of the Courts, as well Soveraign as inferiour: And we Will and Require
alſo to be taken away and defaced all Marks, Foot-ſteps, and Monuments of the ſaid
Executions, Books, and Acts defamatory againſt their Perſons, Memory and Poſterity,
and that the places which have been for that occaſion demoliſhed or raſed, be rendred
in ſuch condition as now they are to the Proprietors of the ſame, to enjoy and diſpoſe
at their pleaſure. And generally we cancell, revoke and null all proceedings and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations
made for any enterprize whatſoever, pretended Crimes of high Treaſon, and
others: notwithſtanding the procedures, decrees and judgments containing re-union, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporation,
and confiſcation; and we farther Will and Command, that thoſe of the
Reformed Religion, and others that have followed their party, and their Heirs re-enter
really and actually into the poſſeſſion of all and each of their Goods.</p>
            <p>59. All Proceedings, Judgments and Decrees given, during the troubles againſt thoſe
of the Religion who have born Arms, or are retired out of our Kingdom, or within
the ſame into Cities and Countries by them held, or for any other cauſe as well as for
Religion and the troubles; together with all non-ſuiting of Cauſes, Preſcriptions, as
well Legal, Conditional, as Cuſtomary, ſeizing of Fiefs fallen during the
troubles, by hindring Legitimate proceedings, ſhall be eſteemed as not done or happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and ſuch we have declared and do declare, and the ſame we have and do anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilate
and make void, without admitting any ſatisfaction therefore: but they ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored
to their former condition, notwithſtanding the decrees and execution of the
ſame; and the poſſeſſion thereof ſhall be rendred to them, out of which they were upon
this account diſſeiſed. And this, as above, ſhall have like place, upon the account of
thoſe that have followed the party of thoſe of the Religion, or who have been abſent
from our Kingdom upon the occaſion of the troubles. And for the young children of
perſons of Quality aboveſaid, who died during the troubles, We reſtore the parties into
the ſame condition as they were formerly, without refunding the expence, or being
obliged for the Amerciaments not underſtanding nevertheleſs that the Judgements given
by the chief Judges, or other inferiour Judges againſt thoſe of the Religion, or who
have followed their Party, ſhall remain null, if they have been given by Judges ſitting in
Cities by them held, which was to them of free acceſs.</p>
            <p>60. The Decrees given in our Court of Parliament, in matters whereof the Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance
belongs to the Chambers or Courts ordained by the Edict in the Year 1577 and
Articles of <hi>Nerac</hi> and <hi>Flex</hi> into which Courts the Parties have not proceeded volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily,
but have been forced to alledge and propoſe declinatory ends, and which decrees
have been given by default or forecluſion, as well in Civil as Criminal matters, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
which Allegations the ſaid Parties have been conſtrained to go on, ſhall be
in like manner null and of no value. And as to the decrees given againſt thoſe of the
Religion, who have proceeded voluntarily, and without having propoſed ends declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
thoſe decrees ſhall remain without prejudice for the execution of the ſame. Yet
nevertheleſs permitting them, if it ſeem good to them, to bring by Petition their
Cauſe before the Chamber ordained by the preſent Edict, without that the elap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the time appointed by the Ordinances ſhall be to their prejudice: and untill the ſaid
Chambers and Chanceries, for the ſame ſhall be eſtabliſhed. Verbal appellations, or
in writing interpoſed by thoſe of the Religion before Judges, Regiſters, or Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners,
Executors of Decrees and Judgements, ſhall have like effect as if they were by
command from the King.</p>
            <p>61. In all inquiries which ſhall be made for what cauſe ſoever in matters Civil, if the
Inquiſitor or Commiſſioner be a Catholick, the Parties ſhall be obliged to convene
an Aſſiſtant, and where they will not do it, there ſhall be taken from the Office by the
ſaid Inquiſitor or Commiſſioner one who ſhall be of the Religion, and the ſame ſhall be
practiſed when the Commiſſioner or Inquiſitor ſhall be of the ſaid Religion for an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtant
who ſhall be a Catholick.</p>
            <p>62. We Will and Ordain, That our Judges may take Cognizance of the validity of
Teſtaments, in which thoſe of the Religion may have an interest if they require it;
and the appellations from the ſaid Judgements, may be brought to the ſaid Chambers or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
for the Proceſs of thoſe of the Religion; notwithſtanding all Cuſtoms to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
even thoſe of <hi>Bretagne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:100016:8"/>
63. To obviate all differences which may ariſe betwixt our Courts of Parliaments,
and the Chambers of the ſame Courts, ordained by our preſent Edict, there ſhall be
made by us a good and ample Reglement, betwixt the ſaid Courts and Chambers, and ſuch
as thoſe of the Religion ſhall enjoy entirely from the ſaid Edict, the which Reglement
ſhall be verified in our Courts of Parliaments, and kept and obſerved without having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to precedents.</p>
            <p>64. We inhibit and forbid all our Courts, Soveraign and others of this Realm, the
taking Cognizance, and judging the Civil, or Criminal proceſs of thoſe of the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
the Cognizance of which is attributed by our Edict to the Chambers of Edict;
provided that the Appeal thereunto be demanded as is ſaid in the Fortieth Article go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
before.</p>
            <p>65. We alſo Will and Command, for the preſent, and untill we have otherwiſe
therein ordained, that in all Proceſs commenced, or to be commenced, where thoſe of
the Religion are Plaintiff or Defendants, Parties, Principals or Guarrantees in matters
Civil, in which our Officers and chief Courts of Juſtice have pow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2+ letters">
                  <desc>••…</desc>
               </gap> to judge without
appeal, that it ſhall be permitted to them to except againſt two of the Chamber, where
the Proceſs ought to be Judged, who ſhall forbear Judgement of the ſame; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
having the cauſe expreſſed, ſhall be obliged to withdraw, notwithſtanding the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
by which the Judges ought not to be excepted againſt without cauſe ſhown, and ſhall
have farther right to except againſt others upon ſhewing cauſe. And in matters Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal,
in which alſo the ſaid Courts of Juſtice and others of the Kings ſubordinate
Judges do Judge without appeal, thoſe of the Religion may except againſt three of the
ſaid Judges without ſhowing Cauſe. And the Provoſts of the Mareſchalſie of <hi>France,</hi>
vice-Bayliffs, vice-Preſidents, Lievetenants of the ſhort Robe, and other Officers of the
like Quality ſhall Judge according to the Ordinances and Reglements heretofore given
upon the account of Vagabonds. And as to the houſhold charged and accuſed
by the Provoſts, if they are of the ſaid Religion, they may require that three
of the ſaid judges, who might have Cognizance thereof, do abſtain from the Judgement of
their Proceſs, and they ſhall be obliged to abſtain therefrom without having cauſe ſhewn
except where the Proceſs is to be judged, there ſhall be found to the number of two in
Civil, and three in Criminal Cauſes of the Religion, in which caſe it ſhall not be lawfull
to except without Cauſe ſhewn: and this ſhall be reciprocall in the like caſes, as above,
to the Catholicks upon the account of Appeals from the Judges, where thoſe of
the Religion are the greater number, not underſtanding nevertheleſs that the chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
Provoſts of the Marſhalſies, vice-Bayliffs, vice-Stewards, and others who judge
without appeal, take by virtue of this that is ſaid, Cognizance of the paſt Troubles.
And as to crimes and exceſs happening by other occaſions than the troubles ſince the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of <hi>March,</hi> 1585. untill the end of 1597. in caſe they take Cognizance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
We will that an appeal be ſuffered from their Judgement to the Chamber ordained
by the preſent Edict, as ſhall be practiſed in like manner for the Catholick and Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates,
where thoſe of the Religion are Parties.</p>
            <p>66. We Will and Ordain alſo, that henceforward in all inſtructions other than infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
of criminal Proceſs in the chief Juſtices Court of <hi>Tholouſe, Carcaſſonne, Rover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que,
Loragais, Beziers, Montpellier and Nimes,</hi> the Magiſtrate or Commiſſary deputed for
the ſaid inſtructions if he is a Catholick ſhall be obliged to take an Aſſociate who is of the
Religion, whereof the Parties ſhall agree; or where they cannot agree, one of the
Office of the ſaid Religion ſhall be taken by the aboveſaid Magiſtrate or Commiſſioner:
as in like manner, if the ſaid Magiſtrate or Commiſſioner is of the Religion, he ſhall be
obliged in the ſame manner, as aboveſaid, to take and aſſociate a Catholick.</p>
            <p>67. When it ſhall be a queſtion of making a criminal Proceſs by the Provoſts of the
Marſhalſies or their Leivetenants, againſt ſome of the Religion, a houſe-keeper who is
charged and accuſed of a crime belonging to the Provoſt, or ſubject to the Juriſdiction
of a Provoſt, the ſaid Provoſt or their Leivetenants, if they are Catholicks, ſhall be
obliged to call to the inſtruction of the ſaid Proceſs an Aſſociate of the Religion: which
Aſſociate ſhall alſo aſſiſt at the Judgement of the difference, and in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitive
Judgement of the ſaid Proceſs: which difference ſhall not be judged other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
than by the next Preſidial Court aſſembled with the principal Officers of the ſaid
Court which ſhall be found upon the place, upon penalty of nullity, except the accuſed
ſhall require to have the difference Judged in the Chambers ordained by the preſent Edict:
In which caſe upon the account of the houſe-keepers in the Provinces of <hi>Guyenne, Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guedoc,
Province,</hi> and <hi>Dauphine,</hi> the ſubſtitutes of our Procurators general in the ſaid
Chambers, ſhall at the requeſt of the ſaid houſe-keepers, cauſe to be brought into the ſame
the Charges and Informations made againſt them, to know and judge if the Cauſes are
tryable before the Provoſt or not, that according to the quality of the crimes they may by
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100016:9"/>
the Chamber be ſent back to the Ordinary, or judged tryable by the Provoſt, as ſhall be
found reaſonable by the contents of our preſent Edict; and the Preſidial Judges, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voſts
of Mareſchalſie, vice-Bayliffs, vice-Stewards, and others who Judge without Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal,
ſhall be obliged reſpectively to obey and ſatisfie the commands of the ſaid Chambers,
as they uſe to do to the ſaid Parliaments, upon Penalty of the loſs of their Eſtates.</p>
            <p>67. The outcries for ſale of Inheritances, and giving notice thereof by warning paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

            <p>69. All Title and papers, inſtructions, and documents which have been taken, ſhall be
reſtored by both parties to thoſe to whom they belong, though the ſaid Papers, or the
Caſtles and houſes in which they were kept, have been taken and ſeized by ſpecial
Commiſſion from the laſt deceaſed King, our moſt honoured Lord and Brother in Law,
or from us, or by the command of the Governors and Lievetenant Generals of our
Provinces, or by the authority of the heads of the other party, or under what pretext
ſoever it ſhall be.</p>
            <p>70. The children of thoſe that are retired out of our Kingdom ſince the death of <hi>Henry</hi>
the Second our Father-in-Law, by reaſon of Religion and Troubles, though the ſaid
Children are born out of the Kingdom, ſhall be held for true French Inhabitants: And
we have declared and do declare, that it is Lawfull for ſuch as at any time within
ten years after the publication of this preſent Edict, to come and dwell in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
without being needfull to take Letters Patents of Naturalization, or any other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion

touching Children bron in Foraign Countreys.</p>
            <p>71. Thoſe of the Reformed Religion, and others who have followed their Party,
who have before the troubles taken to farm any Office, or other Domaine, Gabel, Foraign
Impoſition, or other rights appertaining unto us, which they could not enjoy by reaſon
of the troubles, ſhall remain diſcharged, and we diſcharge them of what they have not
received of our Finances, and of what they have without fraud paid otherwiſe than into
the receipts of our Exchequer, notwithſtanding all their obligation given thereupon.</p>
            <p>72. All places, Cities, and profits of our Kingdom, Countries, Lands, and Lordſhips
under our obedience, ſhall uſe and enjoy the ſame Priviledges, Immunities, Liberties,

only by occaſion of the troubles, which Courts or Seats of Juſtice ſhall be reſtored to the
Cities and places where they have been formerly.</p>
            <p>73. If there are any Priſoners who are yet kept by anthority of Juſtice, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
in Gallies, by reaſon of the Troubles, or of the ſaid Religion, they ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed

            <p>74. Thoſe of the Religion ſhall never hereafter be charged and oppreſſed with any
charge ordinary or extraordinary more than the Catholicks, and according to their abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and trades; and the parties who ſhall pretend to be over-charged above their abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
may appeal to the Judges, to whom the Cognizance belongs, and all our Subjects as
well Catholick as of the Reformed Religion, ſhall be indifferently diſcharged of all charge
which have been impoſed by one and the other part, during the troubles, upon thoſe
that were on the contrary party, and not conſenting, as alſo of debts created and not

            </p>
            <p>75. We do not alſo underſtand, that thoſe of the Religion, and others who have
followed their party, nor the Catholicks who dwell in Cities and places kept and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
by them, and who have contributed to them, ſhall be proſecuted for the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

            <p>76. All Generals, Lords, Knights, Gentlemen, Officers, Common-Councills of
Cities and Commonalties; and all others who have aided and ſuccoured them, their
Wives, Heirs, and Succeſſors, ſhall remain quitted and diſcharged of all Money which have
been by them and their order taken and levied, as well the Kings Money, to what ſum
ſoever it may amount, as of Cities and Communities, and particular rents, revennues,

have by them been imployed in the levying of the ſaid money, or that they have given
or furniſhed by their Orders, ſhall not be therefore any wayes proſecuted at preſent, or
for the time to come: and ſhall remain acquitted as well themſelves, as their Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries,

diſcharged within four months after the publication of the preſent Edict made in our
Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> acquittances being duly diſpatched for the Heads of thoſe of the

ſince as aforeſaid, the death of <hi>Henry</hi> the Second our Father-in-Law.</p>
            <p>77. Thoſe of the ſaid Religion ſhall alſo remain diſcharged of all General and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial

in their places, and of all Leagues, Diſpatches and Negotiations made as well within as
without the Kingdom: and in general, of all that hath been done, deliberated, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
and ordained by the ſaid Aſſembly and Councell, ſo that thoſe who have given
their advice, ſigned, executed, cauſed to ſign and execute the ſaid Ordinances, Regle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and deliberations, ſhall not be proſecuted, or their Wives, Heirs and Succeſſors,
now and for the time to come, though the particulars thereof be not amply declared.
And above all, perpetual ſilence is hereby commanded to our Procurators-General and
their Subſtitutes, and all thoſe who may pretend to an intereſt therein, in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
faſhion or manner it may be, notwithſtanding all Decrees, Sentences, Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
Informations, and Procedures made to the contrary.</p>
            <p>78. We further approve, allow, and authorize the Accounts which have been heard,
ballanced, and examined by the deputies of the ſaid Aſſembly: willing and requiring
that the ſame, together with the acquittances and peices which have been rendred by
the Accomptants, be carried into our Chambers of Accompts at <hi>Paris,</hi> three Months af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the publication of this preſent Edict, and put into the hands of our Procurator-gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
to be kept with the Books and Regiſters of our Chamber, to have there recourſe to them
as often as ſhall be needfull, and they ſhall not be ſubject to review, nor the Accomptants
held in any kind liable to appearance or correction, except in caſe of omiſſion of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts
or falſe Acquittances: and we hereby impoſe ſilence upon our Procurator-gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100016:10"/>
for the overplus that ſhall be found wanting, or for not obſerving of formalities:
Prohibiting to our Accomptants, as well of <hi>Paris</hi> as of other Provinces where they are
eſtabliſhed, to take any Cognizance thereof in any ſort or manner whatſoever.</p>
            <p>79. And as the Accompts which have not yet been rendred, We Will and Ordain
that the ſame be heard, ballanced and examined by the Commiſſaries, who ſhall by us be
deputed thereunto, who without difficulty ſhall paſs and allow all the parcels paid by the
ſaid Accomptants, by vertue of the Ordinances of the ſaid Aſſembly, or others having
power.</p>
            <p>80. All Collectors, Receivers, Farmers, and all others, ſhall remain well and duly
diſcharged of all the ſums of Money which have been paid to the ſaid Commiſſioners of
the Aſſembly, of what nature ſoever they be, untill the laſt day of this Month. And
we will and command, that all be paſſed and allowed in the accompts, which Accompts
they ſhall give into our Chambers of Accompts, purely and ſimply by vertue of the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quittances
which ſhall be brought; and if any ſhall hereafter be delivered they ſhall remain
null, and thoſe who ſhall accept or deliver them, ſhall be condemned in the penalty of
Forgery. And where there ſhall be any Accompts already given in, upon which there
ſhall have intervened any Raiſings or Additions, we do hereby taken away the ſame, and
re-eſtabliſh the parties intirely, by vertue of theſe preſents, which being needfull to
have particular Patents, or any other thing than an extract of this preſent Article.</p>
            <p>81. The Governors, Captains, Conſuls, and Perſons Commiſſioned to recover Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
for paying Garriſons held by thoſe of the Religion, to whom our Receivers and
Collectors of Pariſhes have furniſhed by Loan upon their credits and obligations, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by conſtraint, or in obedience to the commandment of the Treaſurers-General,
and the Money neceſſary for the entertaining of the ſaid Garriſons, untill the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of the State which we diſpatched in the beginning of 1596. and augmentations
ſince agreed unto by us, ſhall be held acquitted and diſcharged of all which hath been
paid for the effect above ſaid, though by the ſaid Scedules and obligations no mention
hath been thereof made, which ſhall be to them rendred as null. And to ſatisfie therein the
Treaſurers-general in each generality, the particular Treaſurers of our Tallies ſhall give
their acquittances to the ſaid Collectors; and the Receivers-general ſhall give their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quittances
to the particular Receivers: and for the diſcharge of the Receivers general,
the ſums whereof they ſhould have given account, as is ſaid, ſhall be indorſed upon the
Commiſſions levied by the Treaſurer of the expenſes, under the name of Treaſurers-General
for the extraordinaries of our Wars, for the payment of the ſaid Garriſons.
And where the ſaid Commiſſions ſhall not amount to as much as the eſtabliſhment and
augmentations of our Army did in 1596. We ordain that to ſupply the ſame, there
ſhall be diſpatched new Commiſſions for what is neceſſary for the diſcharge of our Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comptants,
and reſtitution of the ſaid Promiſes and Obligations, in ſuch ſort as there
ſhall not for the time to come be any thing demanded thereof from thoſe that ſhall have
made them, and that all Patents of Ratifications which ſhall be neceſſary for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
of Accomptants, ſhall be diſpatched by virtue of this preſent Article.</p>
            <p>82. Thoſe alſo of the ſaid Religion ſhall depart and deſiſt henceforward from all
Practices, Negotiations, and Intelligences, as well within as without our Kingdom; and
the ſaid Aſſemblies and Councels eſtabliſhed within the Provinces, ſhall readily ſeparate;
and alſo all the Leagues and Aſſociations made or to be made under what pretext ſoever,
to the prejudice of our preſent Edict, ſhall be cancelled and annulled, as we do cancell
and annull them; prohibiting moſt expreſly to all our Subjects to make henceforwards
any Aſſeſments or Leavy's of Money, Fortifications, Enrolments of men, Congregations
and Aſſemblies of other than ſuch as are permitted by our preſent Edict, and without
Arms: And we do prohibit and forbid them to do the contrary upon the penalty of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſeverely puniſhed as Contemners and Breakers of our Commands and Ordinances.</p>
            <p>83. All Prizes which have been taken by Sea, during the Troubles, by vertue of
the leave and allowance given, and thoſe which have been made by Land, upon thoſe of
the contrary Party, and which have been Judged by the Judges and Commiſſioners of
the Admiralty, or by the Heads of thoſe of the Religion, or their Councell, ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
extinguiſhed under the benefit of our preſent Edict, without making any proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
the Captains or others who have made the ſaid Prizes, their Securities, Judges,
Officers, Wives and Heirs, ſhall not be proſecuted nor moleſted in any ſort whatſoever,
notwithſtanding all the Decrees of our Privy Councell and Parliaments, of all Letters
of Mart and ſeizures depending and not Judged of, We will and require that there
be made a full and intire diſcharge of all Suits ariſing therefrom.</p>
            <p>84. In like manner there ſhall not be any proſecution of thoſe of the Religion for
the oppoſitions and obſtructions which they have given formerly, and ſince the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
in the execution of Decrees and Judgements given for the re-eſtabliſhment of the
Catholick Religion in divers places of this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:100016:10"/>
85. And as to what hath been done, or taken during the Troubles out of the way
of Hoſtility, or by Hoſtility againſt the Publick or particular rules of the Heads of
Communalties of the Provinces which they commanded, there ſhall be no proſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by the way of Juſtice.</p>
            <p>86. Foraſmuch that whereas that which hath been done againſt the rules of one
party or the other is indifferently excepted and reſerved from the general abolition
contained in our preſent Edict, and is liable to be inquired after or proſecuted, yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs
no Soldier ſhall be troubled, whence may ariſe the renewing of troubles; and
for this cauſe, We Will and Ordain, that execrable caſes ſhall only be excepted out of
the ſaid abolition: as raviſhing and forcing of Women and Maids, Burnings, Murders,
Robberies, Treachery, and lying in wait or ambuſh, out of the way of hoſtility, and for
private revenge, againſt the duty of War, breaking of Paſs-ports and Safeguards, with
murders and Pillages without command from thoſe of the Religion, or thoſe that have
followed the party of their Generals who have had authority over them, founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
particular occaſions which have moved them to ordain and command it.</p>
            <p>87. We Ordain alſo, that puniſhment be inflicted for Crimes and offences committed
betwixt perſons of the ſame party, if Acts not commanded by the hands of one Party or
the other by neceſſity of Law and Order of War. And as for the Leavying and exacting of
Money, bearing of Arms, and other exploits of War done by private authority
and without allowance, the parties guilty thereof ſhall be proſecuted by way of
Juſtice.</p>
            <p>88. The Cities diſmantled during the troubles, may with our permiſſion be re-edified
and repaired by the Inhabitants at their Coſts and Charges, and the proviſions granted
heretofore upon that account ſhall hold and have place.</p>
            <p>89. We Ordain, and our Will and Pleaſure is, that all Lords, Knights, Gentlemen,
and others of what quality and condition ſoever of the Reformed Religion, and others
who have followed their Party, ſhall enter and be effectually conſerved in the enjoyment
of all and each of their Goods, Rights, Titles, and Actions, notwithſtanding the
Judgements following thereupon during the ſaid troubles, and by reaſon of the ſame;
with Decrees, Seizures, Judgements, and all that ſhall follow thereupon, we have to
this end declared, and we do declare them null and of no effect and value.</p>
            <p>90. The acquiſitions that thoſe of the Reformed Religion, and others which have
followed their Party, have made by the authority of the deceaſed Kings our predeceſſors
or others, for the immovables belonging to the Church, ſhall not have any place or effect;
but we ordain and our pleaſure is, that the Eccleſiaſticks enter immediately, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
delay be conſerved in the poſſeſſion and enjoyment really and actually of the ſaid
goods ſo alienated, without being obliged to pay the purchaſe-money which to this
effect we have cancelled and revoked as null, without remedy for the Purchaſers to have
againſt the Generals, &amp;c. by the authority of which the ſaid goods have been ſold. Yet
nevertheleſs for the re-imburſement of the Money by them truly and without fraud
disburſed, our Letters Patents of permiſſion ſhall be diſpatched to thoſe of the Religion,
to interpoſe and equalize bare ſums of the ſaid purchaſes coſt, the Purchaſers not being
allowed to bring any action for their Damages and intereſt for want of enjoyment; but
ſhall content themſelves with the re-imburſement of the Money by them furniſhed for
the price of the acquiſitions, accounting for the price of the fruits received, in caſe that
the ſaid Sale ſhould be found to be made at an under rate.</p>
            <p>91. To the end that as well our Juſtices and Officers as our other Subjects be clearly
and with all certainty advertiſed of our Will and Intentions, and for taking away all
ambiguity and doubt which may ariſe from the variety of former Edicts, Articles, ſecret
Letters Patents, Declarations, Modifications, Reſtrictions, Interpretations, Decrees and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſters,
as alſo all ſecrets as well as other deliberations heretofore by us or the Kings our
predeceſſors, made in our Courts of Parliaments or otherwayes, concerning the ſaid Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Religion, and the troubles hapning in our ſaid Kingdom, we have declared and do
hereby declare them to be of no value and effect: and as to the derogatory part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
contained, we have by this our Edict abrogated, and we do abrogate, and from
henceforward we cancell, revoke, and anull them. Declaring expreſly that our Will
and Pleaſure is, that this our Edict be firmly and inviolably kept and obſerved as well
by our Juſtices and Officers, as other Subjects, without heſitation, or having any regard
at all to that which may be contrary or derogatory to the ſame.</p>
            <p>92. And for the greater aſſurance of the keeping and obſerving what we herein de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,
we Will and Ordain, and it is our pleaſure, that all the Governors and Leivetenants
General of our Provinces, Bayliffs, Chief-Juſtices and other ordinary Judges of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of our ſaid Kingdom immediately after the receit of this ſame Edict, and do bind
themſelves by Oath to keep and cauſe to be kept and obſerved each in their diſtrict as

Livetenants, and other Judges to make the principal Inhabitants of the ſaid Cities, as
well of the one Religion as the other, to ſwear to the keeping and obſerving of this
preſent Edict immediately after the publication thereof: And taking all thoſe of the
ſaid Cities under our Protection, command that one and the other reſpectively ſhall ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
anſwer for the oppoſition that ſhall be made to this our ſaid Edict within the ſaid
Cities by the Inhabitants thereof, or elſe to preſent and deliver over to Juſtice the ſaid
oppoſers.</p>
            <p>We Will and Command our well beloved the people holding our Courts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
Chambers of Accounts, and Courts of Aids, that immediately after the receipt
of this preſent Edict they cauſe all things to ceaſe, and upon penalty of Nullity of the
Acts which they ſhall otherwiſe do, to take the like Oath as above, and to publiſh and

purely and ſimply, without uſing any Modifications, Reſtrictions, Declarations, or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
Regiſters, or expecting any other Order or Command from us: and we do require
our Procurators-general to purſue immediately and without delay the ſaid publication
hereof.</p>
            <p>We give in command to the People of our ſaid Courts of Parliaments, Chambers
of our Courts, and Courts of our Aids, Bayliffs, Chief-Juſtices, Provoſts and other

                  <hi>LEWIS,</hi> By the Grace of God, King of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Navarr,</hi> To all
thoſe to whom theſe Preſents ſhall come, Greeting. Our greateſt
care ſince we came unto the Crown hath been to maintain our Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Subjects, and thoſe that be of the pretended Reformed Religion
in perfect Peace and Tranquility, obſerving exactly the Edict of
<hi>Nantes,</hi> and that of the Year 1629. But although the Laws foreſee thoſe Caſes
which happen more ordinarily, ſo as to apply thereto neceſſary pre-cautions; yet ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a multiplicity of Actions which daily occurr, cannot be reduced to one cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
rule; It was therefore neceſſary to make particular proviſions aſſoon as diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
of any ſort did occaſionally ariſe, and therein to make Judgement and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion
by the ordinary Rules and Forms of Juſtice: Which thing hath made way

us to reduce the ſaid Deciſions into one ſingle declaration, adjoyning thereunto
certain Articles touching ſome Actions thereupon occuring, to the end that the

thereto, and cauſe to ceaſe the diſcords and altercations which may ariſe on ſuch
like actions; and that what hath been Judged and decided by the ſaid Decrees,
may be for ever confirmed and eſtabliſhed, and may be put in Execution as a Law
inviolable. For theſe cauſes with the advice of our Counſel, and of our certain
knowledge, full power and authority Royal, We have by theſe Preſents ſigned with
our hand, ſaid, and declared, ſay and declare, We Will, and it is our Pleaſure
that the ſaid Decrees made in our Counſell, be kept and obſerved according to their

                  <head>Obſervations upon this Preface.</head>
                  <p>IF this Declaration, which contains fifty nine Articles, had hurt them of the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Reformed Religion only in points of Commodity and Convenience; they have
ſo much reſpect for whatſoever bears the Auguſt name of their Soveraign, they would
have contained themſelves in ſilence, and not have troubled by the importunity of
their Complaints, the ſatisfaction which this great Monarch doth injoy in the ſweets of
Peace and proſperities of his Eſtate. But the deplorable extremity to which they ſee
themſelves to be reduced, doth forcibly draw from them whether they will or no, thoſe
groans which they would have ſtifled if their Sorrows had not been extreme. For this
Declaration which they eſteem as the greateſt and moſt rigorous blow, by which they
could be ſmitten; like a clap of Thunder, doth throw them into the greateſt terrors,
and doth not ſuffer them to be ſilent: And it ſeems to them that they ſhould make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
Criminals, if upon this ſo preſſing an occaſion, which threatens their Goods,
their Honours, their Families, their Lives, and which is yet more and more dear unto
them, their Religion, and the Liberty of their Conſciences, they ſhould not
cauſe their ſad voice to be heard by his Majeſty, for that were no other than to teſtify
an injurious diſtruſt, as if his Juſtice and his Royal protection could be wanting to his
miſerable Subjects, who come to proſtrate themſelves at the feet of this extraordinary
Prince, given of God expreſly for this end, that he might do good unto men, and that
his Scepter, no leſs Juſt than Puiſſant, might be the Sanctuary of afflicted Innocence.
So that it is not only their neceſſity but their ſence of their Duty it ſelf, which gives them
of the pretended Reformed Religion the boldneſs to addreſs themſelves unto the King,
to demand of him with all profound Humility, the revocation of an Ordinance,
which is not properly his own work, but of them of the Clergy who have ſuggeſted
it.</p>
                  <p>Kings have alwayes at the higheſt point of their Grandeur and of their Puiſſance,
made no difficulty to change their moſt abſolute Oders, when they have been cauſed to
underſtand that they had been ſurpriſed. And yet even from this alſo they have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Glory; becauſe to give Laws, is only to rule over others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but to revoke thoſe,
which Perſons intereſſed have impoſed upon the Spirit of the Prince, is to Reign over
Himſelf; and this is the means by which Soveraign Force may make it ſelf to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
through all the World as truly worthy of Empire, if the love of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
be more powerfull in his heart than that of his Soveraign Authority. There is
then reaſon to hope for theſe generous ſentiments, from a King whoſe Soul is yet more
noble than the Crown it ſelf which he wears; and whoſe reſolution hath already begun
to diſplay it ſelf in naming Commiſſioners of the higheſt dignity to review the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
now in debate. Which is a Piece that appears ſo many ſtrange wayes, that they
themſelves who made it would confeſs it to be ſo, if they could but for ſome moments
of time deveſt themſelves of their prejudice.</p>

                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:100016:12"/>
I. Firſt of all, the Declaration ſets forth, That it was granted at the requeſt, <hi>and
upon the very inſtant ſupplications of the Arch-Biſhops, Biſhops, and other Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Deputies in the Aſſembly of the Clergy.</hi> Which had it not been ſo clearly expreſſed,
might nevertheleſs have been eaſily known by reading the Memoires of the Clergy, thoſe
publick Memoires which were Printed in the Year one thouſand ſix hundred and ſixty ſix.
For all the ſame things which were remarkable, and which the Clergy pretended to at
that time: all the demands which they made; all the Decrees they propoſed to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to obtain, are found in the Articles of this Declaration. In regard whereof they
can be looked upon no otherwiſe than as the Execution of thoſe ſo deſtructive Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moires,
ſince therein may be ſeen all the pretentions of the Clergy turned into form of
Rules, and Ordinances.</p>
                  <p>II. Beſides, who elſe but the Eccleſiaſticks, that is to ſay, moſt paſſionate Parties,
could ever have conceived that thought which they had, and which they have by ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
cauſed to be ſet in the Preface of this Declaration, where it is ſaid, <hi>that what
hath been judged and decided by the Decrees of the Counſell, ſhould be confirmed and eſtabliſhed
for ever, and be executed as a Law inviolable.</hi> For to deſire that the Decrees in generall
made in Counſel, that is to ſay, Decrees whereof many were given upon a Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
only, and without Cogniſance of the Cauſe; or upon particular Actions and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
circumſtances extraordinary, ſhould paſs into a Law inviolable throughout the Realm,
certainly is a thing that cannot eaſily be conceived. There is no thing more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
than to ſee the Decrees of the Counſel annulled by others ſubſequent, becauſe the
King being better informed of the State and truth of things, Wills that the Rights
of Juſtice ſhould be maintained on the ſame Tribunal where the artifice of the Parties
would have given it ſome defeat; Decrees being indeed no Rules of the Law, but on
the contrary, the Law the true Rule of Decrees.</p>
                  <p>III. The Form and Tenure of the Articles makes it no leſs clear that the
Declaration was a ſurprize. For they are all prejudicial to the Pretended Reformed
Religion. And in the mean time the King in the beginning of the Preface doth
ſay expreſly, <hi>that his greateſt care ſince his coming to the Crown, hath been to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
his Catholick Subjects and thoſe of the Petended Reformed Religion in perfect Peace
and Tranquility:</hi> And a few lines after, that the deſign of this Declaration was
to <hi>nouriſh Peace and Amity amongſt his Majeſties Subjects as well Catholicks as thoſe
of the Pretended Reformed Religion.</hi> In purſuance of this deſign truly worthy the
Juſtice and Goodneſs of the King, the Declaration ought to have been conceived in
ſuch ſort, that in giving ſatisfaction to the one, ſome regard might have been had at leaſt
of the weal and ſubſiſtence of the other; and that not only they of the Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Religion, but they alſo of the Pretended Reformed Religion might have found there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
ſome matter of contentment. But contrary to this ſo juſt a Maxim, this whole De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
is to the diſadvantage of the latter; and ſo far from being proper to nouriſh
Peace and Amity that it can ſerve for nothing elſe but to beget eternal troubles and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions.
This is one manifeſt proof that it was neither the King nor his Counſell that
formed this Declaration, not only ſo partial but ſo openly contrary to ſo conſiderable
a party of his Majeſties Subjects. For Kings have not been wont to deal after this
manner in the Regulations which they make for the union and repoſe of the perſons
whoſe differences they would appeaſe. They do alwayes conſerve the intereſt of the
one part with the other betwixt whom they ſeek to eſtabliſh Concord and good Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.
The Edict of <hi>Nantes</hi> hath been conceived by this true Spirit of Royalty.
For it propounds ſo to regulate the Affairs of thoſe of the Catholick, Apoſtolick and
Roman Religion and thoſe of the pretended Reformed Religion, <hi>that both the one and
the other might find therein ſome cauſe to be contented.</hi> And alſo for the compoſing thereof
<hi>Henry</hi> the Great called unto his perſon, the moſt prudent and beſt qualified of the two
Religions, that he might confer with them. He received their Bills, he hearkned to
their Complaints and to their Remonſtrances, to the end he might not be ſurprized
in any point. But here they of the pretended Reformed Religion were neither heard
nor called; the Eccleſiaſticks only in this (rencounter) had the honour to approach
unto the perſon of the King; and having diſguiſed matters unto him according to the
dictates of their paſſion, they have impoſed upon him ſiniſter impreſſions to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
of the truth, to the end they might cauſe him to ſet forth a Declaration
which they had a long time before framed in their own boſoms. It is then the Clergy
who have ſuggeſted it through the motives of their hatred againſt them of the pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Reformed Religion, and who were deſirous therein to accumulate all things whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
their paſſion could enable them to imagine, as moſt proper to atchieve their over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
and ruine.</p>

                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:100016:13"/>
IV. But that which renders this ſurprize in every reſpect ſenſible and palpable, is
the pablick proteſtation which the King makes in the entrance of this Declaration, that
he will <hi>obſerve exactly the Edict of Nantes and that of</hi> 1629. for it will be found that this
Declaration is ſo very far from exactly obſerving thoſe Edicts ſo authoriſed, that it repeals
them in many of its Articles; ſo that none can doubt but that it is contrary to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of his Majeſty, and that they who have obtained it have ſurpriſed him in the
ſincerity of his heart. For where is the perſon ſo raſh or ſo wicked, as to dare to ſay
that the King doth indeed proteſt that he will obſerve the Edict of <hi>Nantes,</hi> but that
notwithſtanding it is not his intention? They are none but the enemies of <hi>France</hi> and of
the glory of our illuſtrious Monarch who can make ſuch diſcourſes. They of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Reformed Religion who are reſolved to live and die in the reſpects which they
owe unto his Sacred Majeſty, can never have ſuch a ſuſpicion of ſo admirable a Prince,
and the Grand-Child of <hi>Henry</hi> the Great. For that great Heroe who hath tranſmitted
unto him his Vertues with his Blood, gives us very well to underſtand that his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
are uncapable of any ſuch procedure, when he pronounces theſe generous words
which the Hiſtory hath preſerved and he addreſſed in ſo firm a tone to them of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
of <hi>Paris</hi> about the matter of the Edict of <hi>Nantes.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mathieu</hi> in the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth Book 2.</note> 
                     <hi>I find
it not good,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to intend one thing and write another, and if any
have done ſo, I will not do the ſame. Couſenage is altogether odious, but
moſt of all in a Prince, whoſe word ought to be unchangeable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Succeſſor then and worthy Imitator of <hi>Henry</hi> the Great having given his Royal
word, and willed himſelf that the Publick ſhould be thereof both depoſitary and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
even of this his word, by which he hath engaged to obſerve exactly the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
of <hi>Nantes;</hi> it cannot be denyed that all that whatſoever it be which claſhes with
this perpetual and irrevocable Edict, is at the ſame time contrary unto the Will of his
Royal Majeſty. Being then it is ſo, that almoſt in all the Articles of the Declaration of
1666. there are contrarieties to the Edict, we muſt needs conclude that they are ſo
many ſurprizes, of which his Majeſty will do right to his Juſtice by making a ſolemn
revocation of the ſame.</p>
                  <p>V. They who have contrived them believed that they had found a very ſpecious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text
under which they might procure them to paſs, when they repreſented to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
that the Law could not foreſee all thoſe particular actions which might occurr in
the ſucceſſion of time, and that therefore beſides the Edict of <hi>Nantes</hi> ſome other Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
muſt be had, which might ſerve for a certain Rule. But this pretenſe is alſo
another ſurprize. For the Edict it ſelf ſtiles it ſelf <hi>a general, perſpicuous, clear and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Law, by which all thoſe of the one or the other Religion ſhould be regulated in all the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
which had befaln or ſhould hereafter occurr betwixt them.</hi> But for the full diſcovery
of the vanity of this artificial pretext, they of the Pretended Reformed Religion main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that this Declaration under the pretence of explicating and interpreting this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict,
doth ruine it, and that the ſettlements of the one are the overturners of the other.</p>
                  <p>Which thing will appear as clear as day by the following obſervations, which will
give us to ſee that the greater part of thoſe things which are contained in this long De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
are contrary to the Edict of <hi>Nantes,</hi> or if there be any which are not of that
number, they are unprofitable Innovations, and which can ſerve for nothing unleſs it
be ſecretly to dreſs a Trap for the Liberties of thoſe of the pretended Reformed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
Theſe are the two Hinges upon which all theſe following remarks do rowl, and
theſe two Principles do equally conclude to cauſe a revocation of this Declaration; ſince
that the Articles contrary to the Edict cannot accord with the intention of his Majeſty,
and thoſe which are fruitleſs are unworthy to hold any rank in a Royal Ordinance.</p>

                  <p>IF this Article carried no other ſenſe than what appears in open view, they of the
pretended Reformed Religion had found nothing to ſay unto it, ſeeing that they
never pretended that it was permitted them to Preach in any publick place. But
theſe laſt words which are read in the end of this Article <hi>under any Pretenſe whatſoever,</hi>
are an Artifice which the Eccleſiaſticks have invented for to ruine the Liberty of thoſe
of the pretended Reformed Religion, and to authorize certain Decrees gotten of the
Counſel; by ſurprize For they would joyn theſe terms, <hi>under what pretext ſoever it be,</hi>
not to the ſecond clauſe of the Article where it ſpeaks of publick places, but to the
firſt, which in general forbids to preach elſe-where than in places appointed for that
uſage. So that by vertue of theſe words they will prohibit them who have petty Fees
to cauſe Sermons to be made in their own houſes, where they have no Temples nor
Places particularly appointed for preaching: which notwithſtanding is contrary to the
eighth Article of the Edict of <hi>Nantes,</hi> wherein the right of theſe Fees is formally eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed.
And beſides, if a Temple fall to ruine, or is pulled down in ſome popular ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
or burnt by fire, they will pretend that they who have accuſtomed to hold their
exerciſe in that place, cannot aſſemble in any near place, or Neighbour houſe untill
ſuch times as the Temple is re-built, and if a Temple be made unacceſſible by a deluge

they ſpeak of all perſons that have power of High Juſtice without any diſtinction;
and there is as to this point no difference betwixt thoſe that enjoy the right of High
Juſtice by the King's Engagement, and thoſe that poſſeſs it as their own proper eſtate,
becauſe the Morgagee enjoys all the Rights which depend on the Fee of which he is the
Poſſeſſor, until ſuch time as he is reimburſed. The liberty then of Publick Exerciſe
being one of the Attributes of High Juſtice, and of the Fee of Knights Service; it is
but reaſon, that the Morgagee of the Domain, do enjoy it, during his poſſeſſion. The
Edict it ſelf leaves no place to doubt of this. For in the Article we have now alledged,
mention is made of thoſe that have High Juſtice, <hi>Whether as Proprietaries or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſufructua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</hi>
Now the Poſſeſſor of a Demain by Morgage is an Uſufructuary: and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
is compriſed expreſly in the Edict. But the thing will be entirely out of que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
if we conſider the tenth Article of the Edict, where theſe words are read—<hi>So
that the ſaid eſtabliſhment be not hindred in ſuch places of Demain as have been given by the

An exception which ſhews, that the places of the Demeſnes
are ſubjected to the right of Exerciſe as well as others. And to the end that we might not
ſuppoſe that it was the intent of the Edict to be reſtrained to the places of Bayliwicks
only; this tenth Article proceeds thus—<hi>However we do not underſtand, that the ſaid
Exerciſe may be re-eſtabliſhed in places and ſeats of the ſaid Demain, which have been here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
poſſeſſed by them of the ſaid</hi> P. R. R. <hi>which they did enjoy in conſideration of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
or becauſe of their Fees, if thoſe Fees be found at preſent in the poſſeſſion of perſons of the
ſaid Catholick Apoſtolick and Roman Religion.</hi> An exception which doth evidently teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
that Fees of Demain engaged follow in this reſpect the condition of others; which
when they are withdrawn out of the hands of thoſe of the P. R. R. the Exerciſe cannot
be any longer continued; for that the privilege was perſonal, and affixed to the Fee:
whence it follows, that according to the Edict, ſo long as the ſaid Fees are poſſeſſed by
perſons of this Religion, the Exerciſes thereof ought to be freely made there, as in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Fees of requiſite qualification. His Majeſty therefore out of the deſign which he

places where the publick Exerciſe is Celebrated, to hold Synods not only Provincial,

which are thoſe of the High Juſtice, may have the marks of a publick Exerciſe. For
how can a Provincial or a National Synod be held in a place, where there is neither
Chair to Preach nor Bench to ſit? Is it credible that the Edict did command that there
ſhould be a place where the Deputies from the whole Kingdom ſhould have liberty to
Aſſemble in a Synod without giving power to their Miniſters notwithſtanding to aſcend
the Pulpit, to make there the Sermons neceſſary to ſuch Solemn Aſſembles? Being

ſtrange, becauſe the places wherein the pretended Reformed Religion is exerciſed have
nothing at all in outward ſhew, which might move Jealouſie to any perſon: for they
are places altogether ſimple and plain, without Pomp, without Imbelliſhments, and
without Ornaments. There is nothing but a Chair, and Seats without curioſity, and
being they have nothing but what is abſolutely neceſſary, thoſe places cannot reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
be deprived thereof whereunto the Edict gives right of publick Exerciſe.</p>

except only in places where the ſaid publick Exerciſe is permitted unto them by the Edict.</hi> This
Article permits in the places authoriſed by the Edict, publick Prayers to be made, that
is to ſay, in a publick place, at the very place of Puniſhment, before all the great
Concourſe of People aſſembled there: and the Declaration on the contrary forbids with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
diſtinction of places, prayers to be made with a loud voice, and even in private
alſo, in the Chambers of the Priſons, with the Doors ſhut. Are not theſe two ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
oppoſite, which deſtroy one the other? It ſeems likewiſe, that the Declaration
contradicts it ſelf. For if the Miniſters be obliged to comfort priſoners in a Chamber
apart, wherefore are they commanded to ſpeak with a low voice? Since one hath free liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to ſpeak in a Chamber diſtinct from others: or if it be their will that they ſhould ſpeak
with a low voice, why do they oblige them to a Chamber apart? ſince a low voice needs
not a diſtinct place. And beſides, what ſtream of Proceſſes will there iſſue from this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
to ſpeak with a low voice? for they will without intermiſſion make trouble to
the Miniſters for the tone of his voice? They will pretend, that he hath not ſpoken
low enough, and it will be in a manner impoſſible to find the juſt mean betwixt
a voice too low, which the Priſoner cannot hear, and by which he cannot be comforted;
and a voice a little too high, which may be underſtood by others. It will be therefore
neceſſary at the leaſt to regulate this, ſo that itmay be underſtood of a low voice,
that it is to be ſpoken in ſuch a ſenſe as it is uſed in the caſe of the noiſe of thoſe that
work on a Feſtival Day, that it be ſuch a voice as cannot be heard in the Street, nor of
the Neighbours. It is alſo hard to conceive how the Miniſters can obſerve that Clauſe
which ſpeaks of a Chamber apart; for ſhall it be in their power to bring the Priſoners
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:100016:15"/>
into a Chamber apart: If the queſtion were only of them that are condemned to death,
the matter would be eaſie; for they do ordinarily put them in a place apart, after
their condemnation: But the Article of the Declaration ſpeaks of all Priſoners with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
diſtinction. And ſhall the Miniſter have authority to cauſe to lead, or carry into
a Chamber apart a ſick Priſoner, whom they find in the ſame place with many others?
and if the Jaylor will not ſuffer it, then what means ſhall the Miniſters have to cauſe
him to obey them. And it may ſo fall out, that an unfortunate perſon detained in
Priſon for his Debts, or for any other cauſe, may die there without conſolation, or
exhortation to repentance, for that he cannot be in a Chamber apart. This Article
being then impoſſible to be executed, and tending to leave poor Priſoners to die miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
without being aſſiſted in their Conſciences: his Majeſty is moſt humbly beſought
to cauſe this Article to be put out, and to be content in the affair of Priſoners, with the

are forbidden to uſe injurious terms againſt the Eſtate. For this Prohibition ſeems
to preſuppoſe, that they either have been guilty of this Crime, or that they have ſome
propenſity to commit it. And notwithſtanding there is nothing that they abhor more,
and of which they are more incapable. The love of the Eſtate, and zeal of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
are inſeparable in their hearts and mouths. They never expreſs themſelves nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in their Sermons, nor in their Diſcourſes, but as good French and faithful Subjects,
and they never aſcend their Pulpits, but they pray to God for the Sacred Perſon of
the King, for all the Royal Family, and for the proſperity of his Eſtate. As for
what belongs to the Catholick Religion, they always ſpeak thereof with the modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ordained by the Edicts. But to make a Law which commands them <hi>to ſpeak with
all reſpect,</hi> is to expoſe them to the uttermoſt miſery: and they can never aſſure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
any longer neither of their Goods, nor of their Liberty, nor of their Lives, if
this Ordinance continue; for whatſoever moderation they uſe in their Sermons, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
pains they take to chuſe their terms, when they are obliged to touch matters of

they have not <hi>ſpoken with all reſpect;</hi> ſo will it come to paſs, that they ſhall ſee themſelves
every hour overwhelmed with Fines, impriſoned, and condemned to many kinds of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments.
This is the reaſon wherefore his Majeſty is inſtantly beſought to give reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

               <p>THere needs no Law to oblige them of the P. R. R. to obſerve the former part of this

part which forbids them to cauſe any Books to be Printed concerning their Religion,
without the permiſſion of the Magiſtrates, and the conſent of the King's Attournies,
is a rigour altogether oppoſite to the Edict of <hi>Nantes;</hi> for thus it ſpeaks in the one
and twentieth Article, <hi>Let not the Books which concern the P. R. R. be Printed, or ſold pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly,
except in the Towns and places where the publick Exerciſe of that Religion is permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
and for other Books which are printed in other Towns; let them be viewed and reviſed, as
well by the King's Officers, as Divines, according to the true intent of the Ordinances.</hi> Where may
be obſerved an expreſs diſtinction of Books of the P. R. R. ſome Printed in the Towns
where the publick Exerciſe of the P. R. R. is permitted, and others which are Printed
in places where this Exerciſe is not permitted. As for thoſe this Edict wills, that they
be viewed and viſited by the King's Officers; which indeed is but reaſonable, being
there the P. R. R. is not openly and publickly profeſſed. But of the other, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
ſpeaks in a far different manner, permitting to Print them, and ſell them publickly
in the Towns and Places where the P. R. R. is proſeſſed, without ſubmitting them to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:100016:16"/>
the viſitation of permiſſion of the Kings Officers, which is required in the other caſe.
Now therefore the Declaration forbids what the Edict of <hi>Nantes</hi> permits in expreſs
terms. And this is a matter very conſiderable, and whereof they of the pretended
reformed Religion have juſt cauſe to complain, in that this new Declaration is more
rigorous in this point than the Edict of 1576 it ſelf, notwithſtanding that it was made
during all the heat and animoſity of the Civil Wars. For the Edict of 1576. was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to require that the Books of them of the pretended Reformed Religion ſhould be
viewed and approved by the Chambers My parties, of which one half was alwaies found
to profeſs the ſaid Religion. In place whereof this new Declaration ſubjects them of
the ſaid pretended Reformed Religion to obtain a permiſſion from the Magiſtrates and
conſent from the Kings Attorneys who are all of a contrary Religion. This is to make
it impoſſible, for the Kings Attorneys who will never give their conſent to the impreſſion
of Books which treat of another Religion than their own; and to permit them to Print
with this condition, is to forbid them abſolutely againſt the clear and expreſs intent of
the Edict of <hi>Nantes.</hi> This then is a meer ſurprize of the Clergy, who have paſſionately
longed and aſpired to have ſuch an Article as this to be made, as may appear by their
Memoirs which were publiſhed 1661. For their deſire is there found expreſſed thus,
<hi>It is requiſite,</hi> ſay they, <hi>to have a Decree containing a Prohibition to print any Books which
have not been formerly viewed and approved by the Kings Officers,</hi> which alſo teſtifies that
before this time, no Decree had forbidden this, and that it was formerly unknown.
And ſurely it is a matter of admiration that the Eccleſiaſticks deſired to obtain this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition,
for it is not for the advantage of the Catholick Roman Religion. It will ſeem
that they are afraid of the Books which they oppoſe and miſtruſt they cannot anſwer
them. They therefore of the pretended Reformed Religion hope that his Majeſty ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

               </argument>
               <p>VVE cannot admire enough that they have cauſed to be entred in a Declaration
Royal and of Conſequence a Prohibition of the name Paſtor. For this term
hath nothing conſiderable in it, nor any thing that makes for the honour of thoſe
who bear it. It is common both to good and bad Paſtors, and the Holy Scripture
doth often cry out againſt falſe Paſtors that abuſe and corrupt the People. They make
no difficulty to give to the pretended Reformed Churches the name of a Flock; by
what reaſon then do they refuſe their Miniſters the name of Paſtors which is relative
thereto, ſince a Paſtor is he that feeds the Flock? ſo that no more exception is to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
againſt the quality of a <hi>Paſtor</hi> than is againſt the appellation of a <hi>Miniſter,</hi> ſince it
doth barely ſet out their duty without determining whether they diſcharge it well or

of his Majeſty himſelf. For when he did them the honour to write to their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional

               <p>The reſidue of this Article of the Declaration is of the ſame nature with the fifth

goes above it. It is an endleſs ſource and everlaſting Seed of all ſorts of Miſchief to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:100016:16"/>
the Miniſters, who notwithſtanding all the moſt accurate pre-caution, and the moſt
wiſe and modeſt continence, will be continually halled before the Tribunals, caſt into
Priſons, ruinated in their Goods, and overwhelmed in their very Perſons; becauſe there will
be alwayes found ſome ill-minded people who will accuſe them for having ſpoken irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
of the holy things, and Ceremonies of the Catholick Apoſtolick Roman Church.
To the end therefore that they may injoy in this Realm the liberty which was granted
to them by the Edict, his Majeſty is moſt ardently beſought that he would cauſe theſe two
Articles, the fifth and the eighth to be excluded, as which draw innumerable Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

               <p>Neither is it only the concern of the Miniſters ſecurity that cauſes them to demand the
revocation of theſe Articles, but the repoſe and ſubſiſtence of all thoſe perſons in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
who are of the pretended Reformed Religion. For a method hath been taken up
of late which doth ſufficiently make known how much a Prohibition to ſpeak of holy
things and the Ceremonies of the Church may hurt them. That is, that the Pariſh Prieſts
when they pleaſe publiſh their Cenſures and Monitions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> againſt any Perſon of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Reformed Religion obliging all their Pariſhioners in general to depoſe if they
have heard any thing ſpoken by him againſt the Catholick Apoſtolick Roman Religion,
which makes way for them to rip up all a mans life from his very infancy; and if it have
hapned that he have ſpoken of any Controverſie they impute it unto him to have utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
ſome Blaſphemies againſt the Myſteries and Ceremonies of the Church. And ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time

If Caſſocks or long Robes were in ſuch manner peculiar to Church-Men, that it might

Feeding, Cloathing, and Harbouring the Poor. The Diſcipline of the pretended Reformed
Churches makes expreſs mention of theſe three ſorts of Perſons, regulates their Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
their Imployments and their Functions, Being therefore the Edict of <hi>Nantes</hi> in the
thirty fourth Article of the particulars doth authorize the exerciſe of this Diſcipline,
and that even the thirty fifth Article doth formally name the Deacons as being part of the

from entring into their Conſiſtories, contrary to the order of their Diſcipline and the

alſo, no leſs neceſſary to make this Article accord with the Diſcipline of the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

For their Diſcipline, which is the rule of their conduct in their Eccleſiaſtical Politie
Wills, that when they are about the calling of a Miniſter all the Heads of the Families
of one Flock ſhould be aſſembled to give their voice; as being all concerned in the
Eſtabliſhment of a perſon who is appointed for their ſervice: So that if they of the
ſaid Religion may receive none into their Aſſemblies but Miniſters, Elders, and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons,
they cannot call any Miniſters to the ſervice of their Churches when they have
need; which cannot be the Kings intention.</p>
               <p>Beſides the Edict of <hi>Nantes</hi> in the forty third Article of the Particulars, permits thoſe
of the pretended Reformed Religion to aſſemble, to make impoſitions of Monies which
are neceſſary for the Charges of their Synods and entertainment of their Miniſters,
which notwithſtanding they cannot do, if this Article of the Declaration be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as it is, and if they cannot receive into the Aſſemblies of their Conſiſtories other
perſons than their Elders and Deacons.</p>
               <p>And it may may alſo come to paſs that there may be found troubleſome Spirits
who will contend that they may not call offenders and ſcandalous perſons into their
Conſiſtories, to cenſure them according to their merit and to reduce them to their
duty. For the avoiding therefore all ambiguity, and that there may not be left any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
for contentious Spirits to trouble thoſe of the pretended Reformed Religion

and it diſtinguiſheth not betwixt the Univerſal and particular Donations. And
by conſequent it reſpects the one as well as the other. For there where the Law diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſheth
not, men are not to diſtinguiſh. Alſo the King <hi>Lewis</hi> the Juſt, your Majeſties
Father, finding this Law to be indiſputable, confirmed it ſolemnly in 1616. by his
Royal anſwer to the Paper of thoſe of the pretended Reformed Religion in theſe terms.
<hi>The Forty Second of the private Articles made at</hi> Nantes <hi>concerning Donations and Teſtamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Legacies let it be obſerved in favour of the poor of the pretended Reformed Religion not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding

               <p>At the leaſt we cannot doubt that the Kings Juſtice will make him find two things
reaſonable and neceſſary, to which his Majeſty is moſt humbly beſought to have regard.
The one is that being no Ordinances have any power retroactive, nor touch any thing
that is paſt; he would be pleaſed to ordain in the explication of this Article of the
Declaration that it may not prejudice thoſe Donations or Legacies Univerſal which
were formerly made to the Conſiſtories.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:100016:18"/>
The other that it is not the intention of his Majeſty to hinder particular Donations
which may be given to Conſiſtories. It is very certain, that the King's deſign is not to
forbid them. For being that in this Article he forbids only Donations univerſal, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
neceſſarily that he confirms the particular. In the mean time they begin by an
exceſſive tranſport to diſpute the particular Gifts and Legacies; and Parliaments have
lately made ſome rigorous Decrees, againſt which, thoſe of the ſaid Religion demand
Juſtice of his Majeſty, at whoſe Feet they ſeek their only Refuge; beſeeching him to
authoriſe the particular Donations which have been, or ſhall hereafter be made unto the

               <argument>
                  <p>That thoſe of the ſaid P. R. R. aſſembled in their Synod National or Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial,
permit not their Miniſters to Preach, or reſide in divers places by turns,
but on the contrary do enjoyn them to reſide and preach only in one place which is
given them by the ſaid Synods.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THis Article contains two parts, the one regarding the Preaching, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Reſiding of Miniſters in more than one place. As for the Preaching
by courſe in divers places, it is true, that there have been many Decrees <hi>pro</hi> and
<hi>con</hi> about this matter; ſo that indeed the buſineſs being at this day as it were ſuſpended,
amongſt many Decrees contrary to one another; it belongs now unto his Majeſty to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
of them by his Soveraign Authority. And his Juſtice gives them of the P. R. R.
to hope that he will maintain them in the liberty of their Annexes, taking away the
prohibitions which have been made againſt their Preaching in divers places. That
which gives them this hope, is this, that theſe prohibitions have been founded on no
other thing than a Miſinformation. For they never had any other Foundation than
from the Edict of the Month of <hi>January</hi> one thouſand five hundred and ſixty one, by
which it was forbidden Miniſters to walk from place to place, and from Village to Village
to preach there by violence and without right. But it doth not treat at all of this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
of Annexes. For it is agreed, that Miniſters ought not to be Vagabonds, and
wander from place to place of their own fancy. Their Diſcipline it ſelf doth ſorbid
this; and the Maxims of a good Conſcience, as well as thoſe of good Polity do oppoſe
it. Therefore the Edict of <hi>January</hi> is in this point altogether juſt. But the Annexes
ſuffer not the Miniſters to be Vagabonds; but on the contrary fix and ſettle them with
certain flocks. They do not give them liberty to go and preach in places where the
Exerciſe is not permitted; but on the contrary fix them in places where they have right
to exerciſe according to the Edict. What is it then that ſhould hinder the Miniſters
that they may not preach in two or three places of this nature? What pretence can
the Eccleſiaſticks find to give a colour to their Enterpriſe?</p>
               <p>Will they alledge the Edict? But that forbids not to preach in divers places, when
they have a right to exerciſe. Beſides, there is found a Decree made in the Council in
the Month of <hi>May</hi> 1652, by which the King doth formally declare, that all the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
which have outed the Miniſters of this liberty, are contrary to the Edicts. So
that the intent of his Majeſty's being to cauſe the Edict of <hi>Nantes;</hi> to be exactly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
there is ground to believe, that he will leave unto the Miniſters this liberty,
the prohibition whereof he hath himſelf declared to be contrary to the Edicts.</p>
               <p>Will they alledge the Declaration given at S. <hi>Germain</hi> the nineteenth of <hi>December</hi>
1634, which they will pretend to be ſo much the more available, for that it was veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in the Chamber of the Edicts of <hi>Caſtres</hi> the firſt of <hi>January,</hi> 1635? But this
Declaration was founded upon this, that the Miniſters of <hi>Languedoc</hi> went to preach in
divers places of that Province, where that Exerciſe was not allowed them. Theſe are
the proper words which are read in that Declaration, which by conſequence concerns
not the Annexes where they have right to exerciſe.</p>
               <p>Will they alledge Reaſon? But what reaſon is there to hinder a Miniſter to preach
in many places, when one is not of ſufficient ability, nor furniſhed with Fruits of the
Earth to entertain him? Can the Eſtate or the Publick ſuffer any prejudice thereby?
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:100016:18"/>
Do we not ſee, that when Cures are too weak every one to maintain a Curate alone,
they put two together under one Rector? That which is approved amongſt Pariſh
Prieſts, how comes it to be criminal amongſt Miniſters, when the poverty of the Flock
permits them not to have one perſon whole and entire unto themſelves? Beſides
this poverty of theſe ſmall P. R. C. is come from no other cauſe, than that the
penſion of a hundred and thirty five thouſand Livers agreed unto by <hi>Henry</hi> the Great,
for the entertainment of their Miniſters, hath for ſome time ceaſed to be paid. For
if they had continued to be paid, every Flock might have had its own Miniſter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
annexing any. It is not therefore probable, that at the ſame time when the King
withdraws his liberality, that he will hinder the feeble Flocks in the Country to find
out ſome other means to conſerve unto themſelves, at leaſt, a part of the Miniſtry, by
joyning themſelves to ſome other Neighbour's Flock, which may help its Subſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence.</p>
               <p>Do they alledge the Uſage? That is all contrary to the Pretence of the Clergy, for
unto this very day it hath been always ſeen in all the Provinces of the Realm, that the
ſmall P. R. Churches have united themſelves two or three together for to raiſe a Penſion
for one and the ſame Miniſter.</p>
               <p>Finally, do they alledge the Intereſt of the Eccleſiaſticks? Beſides, that they ought
not to be heard in this ſort of Affairs, becauſe they are the principal parties, againſt
whom the complaint is made, it ſeems alſo that it would be for their intereſt to dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
the number of the Miniſters, inſtead whereof, if they hinder them from Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in many places, they will oblige them in every P. R. Church, to uſe their utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
endeavour to have a Miniſter apart, which will much augment their number. For
there is no perſon who will not reſolve rather to ſacrifice his temporal commodities,
than continue deprived of ſpiritual ſood, which he ſuppoſes needful for his Salvation.
So that all the Purſuit of the Clergy in this affair will effect nothing but only to incommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
them of the P. R. R. in their Eſtates, and thereby render them leſs able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
to the neceſſity of the publick.</p>
               <p>Theſe conſiderations are they which give hope that his Majeſty taking particular
cognizance of this Affair will leave them of the P. R. R. in the liberty of their Annexes;
and that in expounding the preſent Article of the Declaration, he will have the goodneſs
to ſay that in forbidding the Miniſters from preaching in divers places, he intends not
to hinder them from preaching, ſave only in thoſe places where they had not right to
exerciſe, according to the Decrees of the Council of the twenty ſixth of <hi>Sept.</hi> 1633,
and of <hi>June</hi> 1635, and <hi>May</hi> 1652.</p>
               <p>As for the Reſidence of the Miniſters, the Edict doth not only authoriſe it in every
Town, and every place of the Realm indifferently in the ſixth Article of the Generals,
and firſt of the Particulars: but moreover hath interpreted himſelf by a Decree made
in Council, <hi>April</hi> 24, 1665, by which it is permitted to Miniſters to make their Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
with their Families in ſuch Cities, Burroughs, and Villages near the place of their
ſettlement as they ſhall chooſe. And without doubt the King intends no otherwiſe
here. But notwithſtanding becauſe this Article of his laſt Declaration may receive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
interpretation, his Majeſty will be pleaſed of his goodneſs to remove all ambigui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
which may be found therein, declaring with reference to the Reſidence of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
that his intention is agreeable to his Decree of 24th of <hi>April,</hi> 1665.</p>

               <p>SInce the Churches of the Feodary Eſtates are eſtabliſhed by the Edict as well as thoſe of
poſſeſſion or of Bayliwicks; they ought to be comprized in the Tables of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods
as well as others. And they have at all times uſed this order from the beginning;
and there is no cauſe to change an uſage ſo conſtant and innocent. All that they can

require of thoſe of the P. R. R. is that in the Tables of their Synods they diſtinguiſh

they ſhould neither have ſuperiour nor Diſcipline, nor be reſtrained by any other curb,
ſo that they might live after their own fantaſie to the prejudice of the Eſtate it ſelf.
For the Tables of the Synods are nothing elſe but the appearances of the Miniſters in
their Aſſemblies, where every one of them is ſet down by his name, and that of the
Church he ſerveth. Being therefore it is neceſſary that the Miniſters appear in their Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods

                  <p>As alſo in like manner, that they of the pretended Reformed Religion may not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
any correſpondence with them of other Provinces, nor write unto them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
pretext of Charity or other affair whatſoever, nor receive appeals from other
Synods, ſave only to remit them to the National Synod.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe Artifice of the Clergy have fitted this Article expreſly to render the inviolable
fidelity of thoſe of the P. R. R. ſuſpected, of which they have given ſo eſſential
proofs to the King, that this great Prince hath been pleaſed to teſtify by publick marks
how well he is ſatisfied therein. For in his Declaration <hi>May</hi> 21, 1652. he uſeth theſe
terms, <hi>And for as much as our ſaid Subjects of the P. R. R. have given us certain proof of
their Affection and Fidelity in theſe preſent occaſions, wherewith we reſt very well ſatisfied.</hi>
And his Majeſty may be pleaſed to remember that in a certain Letter which he wrote in
the Year 1655. and which is found in a publick Book whoſe impreſſion is diſperſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the hands of all the World, he makes uſe of theſe words which are a perpetual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
to them of the P. R. R. <hi>I have cauſe to praiſe their Fidelity and zeal for my
Service, they on their part not omitting any occaſion to give me proof thereof, and alſo beyond all
that can be imagined, contributing in every thing to the behoof and advantage of my Affairs.</hi>
Theſe good Teſtimonies which his Majeſty hath given them in ſo authentick manner,
will incline him to reject this Article which tends to the diſhonour of their fidelity; as
if they were a people capable to betray the Eſtate, and to carry on by their correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies
with the Provinces, Criminal Caballs againſt the Service of their Soveraign,
whoſe proſperity is more dear unto them than their very lives.</p>
               <p>Since the King is pleaſed to permit them to live and to profeſs their Religion in the
Realm, neceſſity requires that they be permitted to write and correſpond with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
for their Eccleſiaſtick affairs, as well as their ſecular: for without this neither
can their Univerſities ſubſiſt any longer, who have no other maintenance but by the relief
of the Provinces, neither can they demand nor receive the payment of the Sallaries of
their Profeſſors and of their Regents: And when they want a Profeſſor they cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
if they be deprived of the liberty of ſearching out, and ſending for them by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
the only means to be imployed in ſuch exigencies.</p>
               <p>It is alſo evident that this Article of this Declaration contradicts it ſelf. For in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding
to receive appeals from other Synods, ſave only to tranſmit them to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Synods, they authorize National Synods, and approve the Convoking of them.
But how can they be Convocate if the Provinces may not correſpond one with another,
and it be not permitted unto them to write; Being the Convocation of National Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods
is not nor cannot be made without Letters ſent into the Provinces, as well to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertize
them of the time as of the place where they are held, as to authorize the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties
which ought to be preſent in thoſe Aſſemblies.</p>
               <p>Finally this Article gives occaſion to them of the P. R. R. to beſeech his Majeſty to
conſent unto their National Synods in the term of their Diſcipline, which requires that
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:100016:19"/>
theſe general Aſſemblies may be held from three years to three years. For during the
long interval of time which intervenes betwixt the National Synods, to hinder appeals
unto other Synods, were to open a gate to infinite helpleſs unredreſſable inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.
This were to forego the means of removing Scandals, extinguiſh Vices, and to
oppoſe the abuſes of the Diſcipline, and corruption of manners. This would bring
in diſorders whoſe courſe and progreſs all good men ought to deſire to obviate, ſtop, and

                  <hi>THe Eſtabliſhment of this Article doth not only ſtifle the Edict of</hi> Nantes, <hi>but
blows it up all at once. For the Edict authorizes the Colloquies in ſuch a
manner as permits not to conteſt their eſtabliſhment. This is in the thirty
fourth Article of the Particulars which hath been already rehearſed on another occaſion,</hi>
That in all places where the exerciſe of the ſaid Religion ſhall be publick, the People may be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled,
and that alſo by the ſound of a Bell, and do all the Acts and Functions that appertain as
well to the exerciſe of their Religion, as the regulation of their Diſcipline, as to hold Conſiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
Colloquies, and Synods Provincial, and National by the Permiſſion of his Majeſty.</p>
               <p>It cannot be imagined that they can elude theſe ſo authentick words, and ſay that the
Declaration doth permit our Colloquies only during the ſeſſion of the Synods, and that
the Edict goes no farther. For the contrary doth appear manifeſtly; and they muſt
firſt make them of the P. R. R. renounce all common ſence, before they can perſwade
them a thing ſo evidently irreconcilable to the intent, diſpoſition, drift and ſettlement
of the Edict, which diſtinguiſhes the Colloquies from the Synods, as different Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,
and which may be held at divers times. If the Edict would only authorize Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquies
during the ſitting of the Synods; they may maintain by the ſame reaſon that they
are not permitted to hold Conſiſtories but in the Synods, nor Provincial Synods but in
the National. The Article of the Edict being not more expreſs for the Conſiſtories
than for the Colloquies, and not expreſſing the one in any other manner than the other,
wherefore like as the one is intirely unſuſtainable, and cannot ſall into the thoughts
of any perſon, ſo the other is no leſs to be rejected.</p>
               <p>Beſides, ever ſince the Edict the P. R. Churches have alwayes without Impeachment
enjoyed this liberty of their Colloquies, and the anſwers made unto their Papers at di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
times by the King's Majeſties Predeceſſors, have maintained them in this uſage,
which by this means is found to have the Edict for its foundation, and alſo the poſſeſſion
of threeſcore and ten Years, which alone is a title more than ſufficient. This is the reaſon
wherefore nothing herein can be changed without contradicting his Majeſties intention,
who declares that he wills that the Edict of <hi>Nantes</hi> be exactly obſerved.</p>
               <p>And certainly the Eccleſiaſticks cannot pretend to any thing wherein they will find
themſelves more deſtitue of all appearance of reaſon than in this point, for what pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
can they make to colour the prohibition of the Colloquies? Do they conclude of
any thing that may render them odious or ſuſpected? Have they not there a Commiſſioner
for the King as well as in the Synods? The affairs which they handle there are they
not purely Eccleſiaſtick? and the ſhortneſs of the time which they imploy therein, which
in ordinary extends not beyond a day or two, ſhews it not that theſe innocent Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
propoſe nothing to themſelves but readily to expedite ſome points of their
Diſcipline? Finally, being they permit the Synods, for what reaſon do they forbid the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:100016:20"/>
Colloquies, which are nothing but ſmall Synods peculiar to one Claſs, one Bailywick,
or one Stewardſhip, as the Synods are general Colloquies for the whole Province?
What then can be the ſcope of this condemnation of the Colloquies? Surely it cannot
come but from a bare meer deſign of inconveniencing thoſe of the P. R. R. and hurting
their affairs. But this cannot be the deſign of the Prince, who ſeeks on the
contrary the repoſe, comfort and commodity of his Subjects, as the Preface of this
Declaration it ſelf doth teſtify. This is only the intent of the Eccleſiaſticks, who hate
them of the ſaid Religion and ſeek all poſſible means to croſs them and to render their
condition miſerable. For to exclude them from the Colloquies, would be a means to
caſt them into inexpreſſible inconveniencies, for that the Synods not ſitting but from
year to year, and in ſome Provinces from two years to two years, they cannot without
Colloquies held in the meanwhile intervals, remedy thoſe previſory and preſſing affairs
which will be now worſe by delay, and which for the moſt part require to be handled
in thoſe very places where they happen, about which they eaſily aſſemble the Colloquies,
becauſe they are compoſed of few perſons and they not far diſtant, which cannot be
ſaid of the Synods. Without theſe little Societies which aſſemble eaſily, they muſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
Vice and Scandals to take their courſe without providing againſt them. Their
Flocks muſt remain whole years and ſometimes longer without Miniſters, when death
deprives them of thoſe that did ſerve them. In one word, ſo it might come to paſs that
they of the P. R. R. might have a whole year without Diſcipline. For when perſons
of bad lives amongſt them cannot be reduced to their duty, there are none but the Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies
that are capable to cenſure them, and they will enjoy licenſe and impunity in their
ſins during a whole year, if the Colloquies be aboliſhed, or remitted to the times of
the Synods only. For this is more truly to aboliſh them than remit them in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
for the Colloquies have nothing to do when once the Synods are aſſembled, for
then all their affairs may be decided in the Synods.</p>
               <p>And this is alſo to require an impoſſibility to oblige them of the P. R. R. to hold their
Colloquies during their Synods, and that in the preſence of the deputed Commiſſioner.
For there are Provinces that contain ſeven or eight Colloquies. What means then can
there be to ſend the Commiſſioners to eight places at one time? Or if they will that it
be done ſucceſſively, how tedious muſt thoſe Synods henceforth be, for regulating as
well the general affairs of the Province as the particulars of all the ſeveral Claſſes? And
where ſhall they find Commiſſioners that will have the patience to attend ſo long time
from their houſes, and to quit their charges and imployments? And will the Governors
of the Provinces or Lievetenants of the King ſuffer the Synods to continue their Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
for many months?</p>
               <p>His Majeſty is therefore moſt inſtantly beſought to revoke this Article, which ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
their Colloquies, and to leave matters of this concern to the terms of the Edict and
Uſage, notwithanding all Decrees and Judgements that have been made to the contrary.</p>

for want of theſe ordinary meetings we ſhould attempt a ſupply by Aſſemblies ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary,
or by Letters-miſſives or by ſome other means. Wherefore to the end
that they might make it impoſſible for them of the pretended Reformed Religion to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
their Diſcipline, which is ſo formally authorized by the Edict, that they might
ruine them by Diviſion; the Clergy have propoſed to have them forbidden all ſorts
of Aſſemblies, Commiſſions, Deliberations and common Letters for what cauſe ſoever,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:100016:20"/>
on pain of being puniſhed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> according to the rigour of the Ordinances. This is a grief
uncapable of any conſolation to them of the ſaid Religion to ſee themſelves thus treated.
For God be praiſed, they have done nothing wherefore their zeal to the Kings ſervice
ought to be ſuſpected, and their adherence to the good of the Eſtate is immovable.
Their conduct and their actions ſpeak for them in the one and in the other of theſe two
things, and they ſhall continue all their lives in theſe ſentiments which make one eſſential
part of the Duty of their Conſciences. In the mean time if they had a deſign to betray
their Country they could not be tyed and chained more ſtrongly than by forbidding
them all ſorts of Aſſemblies, Commiſſions, Deliberations, and Letters.</p>
               <p>Above all this the paſſion of the Clergy cannot ſuffer that they ſhould receive Candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates
in the Intervals of Synods: This is the effect of an animoſity whereof the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
is hard to be imagined. For ſince we are permitted to have Miniſters and
ſince we are not hindred to receive them in the Synods; what reaſon can the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticks
alledge to forbid them to receive Candidates in the Intervals of Synods in
which they think good that they ſhould be examined? It is manifeſt they can render no
other reaſon than their own animoſity, which carries them on to deſire that they of the
pretended Reformed Religion may continue oftentimes unprovided of Miniſters. For
if a Miniſter happen to die immediately after the Seſſion of a Synod, it may ſo fall
out that his Church as a Widow ſhall not only keep a year of mourning, but remain
ſubjected alſo to two years of Widow-hood, in thoſe Provinces where the Synods aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
not but from two years to two years. And it muſt needs be, that during all this
time, ſhe be deprived of the Word of God Preached, and the Adminiſtration of the
Sacraments; that the ſick die there without Conſolation, and Infants without Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm;
This inconvenience being ſo much more remedileſs in the terme of the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
becauſe by the fourteenth Article, Miniſters are forbidden to Preach in divers
places, and by that all means are taken away from a Church that is deſtitute to have
aſſiſtance from any neighbour-Miniſter: So a place that hath right of exerciſe very cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and well known, ſhall hereby be uncapable of enjoying it notwithſtanding.</p>
               <p>But this miſchief doth not ſtay here neither. For if this Article of the Declaration
ſtand, we muſt ſpeak no more of Synods themſelves. It will be impoſſible to call them,
or execute their Orders. For how ſhall they call them if Letters-miſſives be forbidden?
Being this Aſſembly cannot be called but by circular Letters ſent to all the Flocks of a
Province, to give them warning to cauſe their Deputies to appear in the place and time
deſigned for holding thoſe Aſſemblies? And how ſhall they execute their Orders and
Acts, if Commiſſions and Letters be forbidden them; for the Reſolves of Synods are not
executed but by theſe wayes, or by deputing Commiſſioners to carry them to the places,
Or giving them charge to write letters to the perſons concerned, to the end they
may be reduced to their duty when the Synods do ſit no longer; Or by Authorizing
ſome Miniſters to deliberate with their Conſiſtories, and ſo to conclude thoſe affairs
which the ſhortneſs of the time permits them not to project and deſign by the Synods,
Nay, it will not be poſſible to have Miniſters if Commiſſions have no place any more;
for Miniſters are not inſtalled in their charge, nor inveſted in their Miniſtry but by
means of Commiſſioners named in the Synods for laying hands on them, which cannot
be done but in the intervals of Synods, becauſe the Diſcipline of thoſe of the pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Reformed Religion ordains, that the Candidates who have been examined by the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods,
ſhall make three Sermons of tryal on three Lords dayes ſucceſſively before the
Church whither they are ſent, before they can receive Impoſition of Hands and power
to adminiſter the Sacraments, from the Commiſſioners deputed for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>It muſt here be added that this Article proceeds yet farther, and leaves them of the
pretended Reformed Religion no more any ſurety for their perſons or their lives. For
they are forbidden <hi>to deliberate of any affairs for any cauſe, or in any manner whatſoever on
pain of being puniſhed.</hi> So as ſoon as two or three perſons of that Religion be ſeen to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
their enemies will pretend that they are conſulting of affairs, and bring Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
againſt them. There will be no Tranquillity for them in the Realm, neither can
there be any Society, Converſation or Commerce amongſt them without danger. His
Majeſty is therefore beſought with all the Ardour of which his Subjects of the pretended
Reformed Religion are capable, that he would take off this Prohibition, and take away
an Article ſo fatal to their repoſe.</p>

               <p>THe greateſt animoſity ceaſeth for the moſt part after the death of the perſons who

againſt them of the P. R. R. extends it ſelf alſo beyond their deceaſe, and they are deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to trouble them in their Sepultures, of which the ſaid conſolation is not denied to
the greateſt enemies. The Article which the Eccleſiaſticks have obtained, as alſo the
Decree which they have gotten by ſurprize from the Counſel about this ſad affair, is
capable of engendring endleſs troubles and Suits. For they will continually moleſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
about the hour, namely whether the interrment be made after ſix in the morning,
or before ſix at night: About the number, namely whether the Carriers of the Dead be
to be eſteemed to make part of them that aſſiſt as Convoys; in which caſe it often falls
out, when the number is limited to ten, that the Children cannot perform their laſt du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to their Father, or elſe be conſtrained to carry him themſelves to the Grave. They
will diſpute alſo whether thoſe that betake themſelves to the Church-yard to behold
the interrment, and thoſe which are found in the ſtreet looking on the Bier as it paſſeth, are
not to be conſidered as exceeding the number permitted; and they will find many other
means to diſquiet them of the P. R. R. on theſe occaſions, which are ſufficiently dolou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
of themſelves. By which means we ſhall daily find ſome poor families who in
the midſt of the tears they ſhed, and ſorrows which overwhelm them becauſe of the loſs
of their dead, will ſee themſelves alſo againſt all ſenſe of humanity, committed into
the hands of Judges who will condemn them, and of Serjeants who will execute their
Sentences upon them with all rigour. The Edict of <hi>Nantes,</hi> nor other Edicts and
Declarations made thereupon, have never yet limited neither the time of Funerals, nor the
number of perſons. They of the P. R. R. have alwayes enjoyed a full and entire liberty
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:100016:22"/>
in this reſpect, and it is but of late that they have been deprived thereof by the ſolicitation
of the Clergy: Wherefore they hope that his Majeſty conſidering that this limitation
is a Nurſery of Suits and Diſorders, will revoke all this Article of the Declaration, and
the Decrees which have been made conform thereto, and will leave them of the
ſaid Religion in the liberty of their Burials, that they may enjoy them ſo and in the ſame
manner as they have been accuſtomed to uſe them before ſuch Decrees.</p>
               <p>But beſides all this his Majeſty will be pleaſed to underſtand, that in the Countrey
the execution of this Article is abſolutely impoſſible, for the Church-yards are very
far diſtant, and oftentimes it behooves them to travail two or three Leagues to commit
their Corps unto the earth. If then they be not to part from the houſe of the dead un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
the entry of the night, how can they make ſo tedious a Convoy through the horror
of darkneſs, many times through dreadful wayes and mires, through which they will have
all trouble imaginable to make paſſage? The morning hour doth not help this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
at all, for if they ſet out at break of day it will be neceſſary thereupon that they
travel two or three hours after the Sun is riſen: from whence the Pariſh Prieſts will not
ſail ſpeedily to lay hold of occaſion to raiſe ſuits, and alſo to oppoſe the Convoy by
violence, as it hath fallen out in many places, ſo that the dead Corps hath been aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
in the midſt of a great High-way; upon pretence that the interrment ought to
have been accompliſhed by break of day, for which reaſon the Parliament of <hi>Rouen,</hi>
who cannot be ſuſpected to be too favourable to them of the P. R. R. have made a
regulation importing that Burials in the Country may be made at all hours, except on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thoſe of the Divine Service of Catholick Apoſtolick Roman Churches. This being a
thing evidently juſt, ſhould be ordained through all the Realm, adding only an expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of what is intended by the hours of Divine Service, that it comprizeth only the
Morning Service and the Celebration of the Maſs, becauſe if the hours of Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
be underſtood to contain all thoſe in which any ſort of Ceremonies or Religious
Offices may be performed, there will be no hours left free in the whole day for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrments
of thoſe of the P. R. R. from whence many Suits have been ſeen to ariſe in
<hi>Normandy,</hi> about the hours of Divine Service.</p>
               <p>But inſtead of making an Article againſt them of the P. R. R. about the matter of
Burials, it were much more neceſſary to make one againſt them of the C. A. R. Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
for they trouble and abuſe the others exceſſively in their interrments, making Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
noiſes and cries after them; purſuing them with blows of ſtones, many times break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
open the gates of their burying places; filling the graves appointed for their Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulture
with Bones and Ordure, and act many other indignities, of which the examples
are ſo frequent, that it were a vain thing to make report of them.</p>
               <p>It is alſo a thing very ordinary with them to hinder thoſe of that Religion from bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
their dead in their Pariſhes where their Predeceſſors have had Burial places, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
pretence that the publick exerciſe of their Religion is not there had or is not there
permitted. And oftentimes violence is uſed to diſſeize them of the liberty acquired by
the Edicts, and ſometimes they come to Arms, and that with a confuſed rout of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to diſpute with them the entry of their Burying places. It is to theſe diſorders
that his Majeſty is moſt humbly beſought to provide remedy, which may hinder that
no ſuch violences nor ſeditious practiſes may happen any more; by ordaining that
the Funerals of thoſe of the pretended Reformed Religion may be freely made, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
moleſtation or ſcandal; and with prohibition to inſult over them in word or deed,

Months the antient Regiſters of thoſe places before the Commiſſioners, Executors

without any re-imburſement: And in caſe they of the ſaid P. R. R. do not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce

doth permit them to buy others at their own charge and expence in places
commodious, and which ſhall be appointed them by the ſaid Commiſſioners or
their ſubdelegates.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe hatred of the Clergy againſt the deceaſed of the P. R. R. is declared by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.
In the twenty third Article they have forbidden them the liberty of
expoſing them before the doors of their Houſes, to expell them from that
ſmall honour unto which notwithſtanding they of the ſaid R. R. have never pretended.
Then afterwards they deprived them of the convenience and benefit of Convoys in the
<hi>24th</hi> Article. And behold here alſo they would take from them their Burying places that
they might deprive them of Burial, which Humanity and the Laws of Nations have allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all the World. It is manifeſt that the Eccleſiaſticks have obſerved no moderation in
this Article, for they Will that notwithſtanding all Acts and Tranſactions, the Burial places
ſhould be taken from them of the P. R. R. If they had pretended that they had uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
their Burial places there had been reaſon to oblige them to reſtore them, but to
dſpoſſeſs them of what belongs unto them by juſt titles, and by vertue of good Acts
and authentick Tranſactions, is to have no regard to right never ſo well eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>They will alledge that the Burying places belong to Churches, and that this is a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
reaſon to deprive them of the P. R. R. becauſe that their Divine Service is diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by their Burials in this caſe. But the Funerals of thoſe of the ſaid R. cannot cauſe
any the leaſt trouble to them of the C. A. R. R. in their Churches, becauſe they are
not made with Singing, Preaching, Prayers, or any Ceremony at their Interrment. And
if the Burying places of them of the P. R. R. belong to any Churches, or are nigh them,
they were the Commiſſioners deputed by his Majeſty who have choſen and aſſigned thoſe
unto them in thoſe places by the conſent of the Pariſhioners.</p>
               <p>It is very true that thoſe of the ſaid Religion refuſe not to forgo thoſe Burial places
which appertain to Churches, and they will be very glad that others be given them in
convenient places. But ſince that thoſe Burying places have been given them by the
Kings Commiſſioners, and they enjoy them by titles unqueſtionable; it is altogether
juſt that the Catholicks ſhould deliver unto them others; or repay unto them the price of
the ground, and charges of Reparations and Augmentations which have been made by
them. And this is the moſt humble ſupplication which they direct unto his Majeſty in
this particular.</p>
               <p>For the other Burial-places which belong not to Churches, and which nevertheleſs
are common to them with thoſe of the C. A. R. R. the Article of the Declaration is in
that point very ſurprizing. For it requires that thoſe of the P. R. R. <hi>ſhould make proof
that thoſe Burying places do not at all appertain to the Catholicks.</hi> That is to ſay, they would
oblige them to prove a negative, againſt all the Law of the World. It had been ſufficient
to require them to prove that theſe priviledges had belonged unto them. For poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
alone of more than forty years ſuffices, and hath the force of an uncontrovertable ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:100016:23"/>
But to conſtrain them to prove that theſe Burying places belong not to others, is
indeed without all excuſe.</p>
               <p>It is alſo true that thoſe of the P. R. R. refuſe not to quit the Burying places which
they have Common with them of the C. A. R. R. But ſince theſe alſo have been aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
them by his Majeſties Comiſſioners, and that they poſſeſs them by Acts and
Tranſactions whoſe Truth cannot be drawn into queſtion; Reaſon requires alſo, that
they be re-imburſed, or that they who would have their burying places, ſhould give them
others at their Charge and Expence in convenient place.</p>
               <p>But inſtead of diſputing with them of the P. R. R. the poſſeſſion of their Burying
places, it were more neceſſary to provide againſt the troubles which are given them to
hinder their enjoyment of thoſe which are not belonging to Churches, nor common to
them with the Catholicks. For this is a very common evil, and which hath of late cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
ſtrange diſorders. For ſo it is, that when there dies in the Country any perſon of the
P. R. R. in a Pariſh where there is no Burial-place appointed for them of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion;
if they would carry the Corps to ſome Burying place which they have in ſome
Neighbour-Pariſh, the Pariſh-Prieſts oppoſe them with incredible heat, yea ſome of
them have come alſo to that exceſs, as to threaten to raiſe the Country againſt the
Bearers, and thoſe which did accompany the Bier. Being this is an inhumane action
and which natural compaſſion cannot ſuffer, that the earth ſhould be forbidden to any
dead perſon whatſoever; the King is moſt humbly beſought to imploy his authority in
this matter, and to ordain that either in every Village, ſome Burying place be delivered
to them of the P. R. R. according to the twenty eighth Article of the Edict of
<hi>Nantes;</hi> or that in ſuch places wherein they have no Burying place, they of the ſaid
Religion may carry their dead to ſome Burying-place, which they have in ſome Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour-Pariſh.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>That Houſe-keepers of the ſaid P. R. R. againſt whom the Preſidial Courts ſhall
iſſue Proceſs, in any caſe ſubject to the Juriſdiction of the ordinary Judges or

when the ſaid Preſidial Courts have commenced the Suit before the Provoſts (or
Ordinary Judges) but the Competence ſhall be Judged by the ſaid Preſidial
Courts; in which caſe the Defendant may refuſe three Judges without cauſe known,
according to the ſixty fifth Article of the Edict of Nantes. Notwithſtanding the
ſaid Houſe-keepers of pretended Reformed Religion being Defendants upon any
Crime under the Juriſdiction of the Ordinary local Judges, may demand their
remiſſion to the Chambers of the Edict, for to cauſe the Competence to be there
Judged, where the Provoſt or Ordinary local Judge ſhall begin the Suit accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the 63, and 67 Articles of the Edict, which ſhall be executed as to Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabonds
according to their form and tenor. And the Judgement made upon the
Declinator by the ſaid Chamber, for the Houſholders of the ſaid P. R. R. ſhall
take place for the Catholicks Defendants, for, or upon the ſame Crime where
the Proceſs ſhall be made conjunctly.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe Import of this Article is terrible, in that it reſpects the Lives of thoſe of the
P. R. R. whom it throws back, eſpecially thoſe of the Provinces of <hi>Guyenne,
Languedoc, Province</hi> and <hi>Dauphine,</hi> into the firſt condition in which they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the erection of the Chambers of the Edict, which were expreſly agreed upon for
their ſakes, that they might not be left expoſed to the paſſions of the inferiour Judges,
whoſe Motions are commonly more ſuddain, more hot, and violent than thoſe of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
Courts. This notwithſtanding, this Article withdraws the Houſe-keepers of
the P. R. R. from under the Chambers of the Edict, to ſubject them in Cauſes in
the Juriſdiction of ordinary Judges unto the Preſidial Court, that they may Judge of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:100016:24"/>
them with Soveraign authority. Which the Clergy pretends to ground on this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.
So it is, ſay they, that the Edict of <hi>Nantes</hi> in its ſixty ſeventh Article hath not
attributed to the Chambers ordained by this Edict, the power of judging of Competen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
in Proceſs Criminal, but only when they are brought by the Provoſts (ordinary local
Judges) and not when they are brought by Preſidial Courts. But there can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more unreaſonable than this imagination of the Clergy. For if Preſidial Courts
cannot Judge of the competition of Provoſts, (inferiour Judges) and are obliged to
remit their Judgement to the Chambers of the Edicts, when the Defendant requires it;
how much leſs are they capable to Judge of their own proper Competence?</p>
               <p>For being herein they are concerned in their own perſonal and particular intereſt,
there is cauſe certainly wherefore they ſhould be the more ſuſpected; what appearance of
Reaſon can there be to make them Judges of their own propoſals? And to what danger
ſhall not the lives of them of the P. R. R. be expoſed for the future, if they be abandoned
to thoſe Judges, out of whoſe hands they have been withdrawn ſo many years by the Edict,
who come now to revenge themſelves on them for the time they have loſt?</p>
               <p>Neither may they pretend to diminiſh this danger, by ſaying that the Preſidents can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
make Criminal Proceſs againſt any Houſe-holder of the P. R. R. but only in caſes
ſubject to Provoſts, ordinary local Judges; for if they be once eſtabliſhed Judges of their
own Competencies all Crimes ſhall become Provoſtall in their hands, wherein perſons
of this Religion ſhall be concerned; ſo inſtead of one Provoſt (Inferiour Judge) from
whom the Edict doth exempt them, they ſhall have many who ſhall treat them ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon all occaſions. And it will come to paſs oftentimes that the Preſidial Courts
by a ſuddainneſs as formidable as that of the moſt fiery Provoſts (ordinary Judges)
will diſpatch an honeſt man in twenty four hours time; becauſe he hath not any means
to bring himſelf before his proper Judges, who are the Chambers of the Edict. Farther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,
it appears manifeſtly by the ſettlement of this 67 Article of the Edict of <hi>Nantes,</hi>
that the intention of the Law-giver was to comprehend equally under the ſame Law
the Provoſts and the Preſidial Courts: for after that he had ordained that the Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency
ſhould be judged by the ſaid Chambers, if the Defendant did require it, he adds,
<hi>That as well the Judges in Preſidial Courts as the Provoſts Marſhal, vice-Bayliffs, vice-Sheriffs,
and all others that Judge finally, ſhould be obliged reſpectively to obey and ſatisfie the commands
given them by the ſaid Chambers, in ſuch manner as they have been accuſtomed to do to Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aments,
upon pain of deprivation from their Eſtates:</hi> Where it is manifeſt that the right of
Judging Competencies granted unto thoſe Chambers, reſpects the one as well as the
other; for the Preſidials have not received power to Judge finally in the four
Provoſtal Caſes (<hi>i.e.</hi> which belong to inferiour Judges) otherwiſe than thoſe Provoſts
had it before: So that the authority of the one ought not to be priviledged more than
that of the others who firſt exerciſed it. In a word, there needs but one thing to be
noted for diſcovery of the ſurprize in this Article of the Declaration, which is this.
That the Edict hath abſolutely taken away from Parliaments the Cognizance of Proceſs
Criminal againſt them of P. R. R. and the Declaration hath attributed ſoveraign Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the ſame unto the Preſidial Courts. Is it becauſe the Preſidial Courts are
more capable more illuminate, and leſs paſſionate than the Parliaments? who ſees not
in this the ſurprize of the Clergy, from which may it pleaſe the King to ſecure thoſe
of the ſaid Religion by a revocation of this Article?</p>
               <p>But they have need that his Majeſty would herein alſo redreſs another miſchief. For
they have attempted to ruine their liberty likewiſe in regard of criminal Proceſs, which
they make againſt them by the Provoſt Marſhals or by their Leivetenants. Witneſs the
Decree got from the Council by ſurprize the 15 of October 1647. which declaring that
the Crimes of making and uttering falſe Moneys, altering the ſpecies and clipping of
Gold or Silver; and the Adherents and Accomplices of theſe Crimes, ſhould be in the
ſole Juriſdiction of the Provoſts in caſe of citation by them, whether the Defendants
were houſholders or not; did forbid the Chamber of the Edict in <hi>Caſtres</hi> to receive the
Petitions of Appeal, which ſhould be preſented unto them by theſe of the P. R. R. upon
theſe Capital heads, when they ſhould be accuſed thereof; or to decree any diſtreſſes againſt
the Clerks of the Provoſts (ordinary Judges) for not remitting of the proceedings,
which had been made before them againſt the Defendants, if they were not actually in
their Priſons. Whereupon it comes to paſs that the Provoſt Marſhals will no longer
obey the Chambers of the Edict, which having made way for divers conflicts about
Juriſdiction before the Council, Decrees were obſerved with aſtoniſhment to be
given ſhortly after, which denied unto the parties accuſed, the remiſſion which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
of the Chamber of <hi>Caſtres</hi> to judge of the Competence. There can be nothing
more contrary than this not only to the Edict, but even to the Kings laſt Declaration,
who in this <hi>26th</hi> Article agrees ſo expreſly that the Houſholders of the P. R. R. being
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:100016:24"/>
Defendants in any caſe Provoſtal (<hi>i.e.</hi> ſubject to ordinary Judges) ſhould be remitted to
the Chambers of the Edict, where their Proceſs is made by the Provoſts; ſo true is it that
one prejudice granted againſt them of the ſaid Religion makes way for many others,
and gives boldneſs to puſh on againſt them the extremity of rigour. For this cauſe, the
King taking notice of the conſequence of the breaches which may be made of the Edict,
will be pleaſed to preſerve it intire, cauſing for that intent this Article to be expunged,
which is found ſo oppoſite unto this Edict, giving ſuch aſſurance unto his Subjects of the
P. R. R. or to Provoſts Marſhal, that they may never more have cauſe to fear any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of their Juriſdiction, from which they are ſo formally exempted, nor of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees

in which they of the P. R. R. are declared <hi>capable to hold and exerciſe all Eſtates,

the Great, as well in the Paper of 1599. upon the firſt Article of the twelfth Chapter,
as that of 1663 upon the 19 Article. The King therefore, who with a deſign truly
worthy the greatneſs of his Soul, is reſolved to walk in all things after the glorious
ſteps of his Grand-Father, will be pleaſed to maintain that which hath been ſo juſtly
eſtabliſhed by that admirable Prince, and will cauſe this Article which is contrary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,

               <p>The importance is ſo great, that if this prohibition be left therein, it will continually

<hi>Mountaubau,</hi> where the private Lievetenant of the Preſidial Court of that Town, hath had
a pretenſion the moſt unreaſonable in the World, and notwithſtanding hath procured it
by ſurprize to be authorized, having obtained upon Petition to the Council a Decree,
importing that another Leivetenant of the ſame Bench but of the C. A. R. R. ſhould

drawn into the Chambers of the Edict for affairs that concern ACCOMPTS

be greater than of the Catholicks, ſaving only to the particular perſons
of the ſaid P. R. R.. to enjoy their priviledge of Appeal to the ſaid Chambers
of the Edict, in which we will that they be preſerved according to the Edicts.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe intent of this Article is more dangerous than the words. For therein is found
by all appearance a fault in the impreſſion, and that in theſe words, <hi>For affairs which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
ACCOMPTS only,</hi> the word <hi>Accompts</hi> is put by miſtake for that of <hi>Commonalties.</hi>
For this Article is taken out of a Decree made in Council the ſeventeenth of <hi>November</hi>
1664. by which the Cognizance of all affairs of Towns and of Corporations, in which
the Conſuls are parties in this quality, is taken from the Chambers of the Edict, albeit
in thoſe Communities the Conſulate be Mipartie and that therein be more perſons of the
P. R. R. than Catholicks.</p>
               <p>But both that Decree, and this Article of the Declarations are a ſurprize made upon
the Kings Juſtice. For the Edict of <hi>Nantes</hi> is to all purpoſes contrary to this new
ſettlement. And the 34th Article of the Generals cannot ſuffer it. There it may be
ſeen that the Law-giver after he had eſtabliſhed the Chambers of the Edict, regulates
their Competence, and ordains <hi>That they ſhould take Cognizance and Judge ſoveraignly and
finally by Decree privative to all others, of Proceſs, and Differences, moved and to be moved,
in which thoſe of the P. R. R. ſhould be the principal Parties or ſecurities, whether Plaintiff or
Defendant, and in all matters Civil or Criminal, whether the Proceſs were made in writing or
by verbal appeal.</hi> It is not poſſible to give a larger extent to the Competence of thoſe
Chambers. For the Edict ſpeaks generally of all Proceſſes, and all Differences, moved
or to be moved, in all matters Civil and Criminal, when they of the P. R. R. are De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants
or Plaintiffs, Parties Principall, or Security, by Writing or Word. Can there be
any doubt, conſidering this exactneſs, that it was not the mind of the Edict to attribute
to the Chambers which it erected, the Cognizance of all affairs of them of the ſaid Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
in what manner of cauſe ſoever they might be; and that in this generality, proceſs
in which Communalties were made parties, ſhould not be comprized as well as others?</p>
               <p>And that which affords a proof yet to more clear, is, that in the ſame Article of the
Edict, after that he had ſo ſtrongly extended the Competence of the Chambers, he
comes in the ſequel to ſpecifie the reſtrictions which ought to be made thereto.
<hi>Except</hi> ſaith he, <hi>for all matters of Benefices and Poſſeſſions of Tythes not inſcoft, Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtick
Patronages, and cauſes wherein ſhall be concerned the Rights, Duties or Demaines
of the Church, which ſhall be created and Judged by the Courts of Parliament, ſo that the ſaid
Chambers of the Edict ſhall have no Cognizance thereof.</hi> There is no perſon that may not
eaſily gather from hence, that if the Proceſs of Communities, in which they of the
P. R. R. have intereſt, could not be brought to the Chambers of the Edict, they ought
to have been placed in this exception, which ſo particularly notes out all the reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
caſes: and in that it hath not ſpoken thereof, it is an indubitable proof that the
Edict had no intention thereof to deprive the ſaid Chambers.</p>
               <p>On the contrary, it appears manifeſtly by the 51. Article of the generals, that it
would have the Chamber of Judge of the affairs of Communalties and Towns. For there
theſe words are read, <hi>There ſhall be made unto the ſaid Chambers Miparties, propoſitions, delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
and reſolutions which belong to the publick Peace, or for the peculiar eſtate and polity of the
Towns where theſe Chambers ſhall be.</hi> For if the affairs which reſpect the publick peace, and
thoſe which concern the eſtate and polity of the Towns, be under the Juriſdiction of
theſe Chambers; it may reaſonably be concluded that thoſe of the Communalties are
not without their Competencie, being that of all the affairs of the Communalties there
are none of greater importance, than thoſe of the publick Peace and Polity of the
Towns.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:100016:25"/>
And certainly reaſon alſo doth evidently agree in this with the Edict. For if in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
affairs, wherein one perſon alone of the P. R. R. is concerned, the Cognizance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to the ſaid Chambers, to the excluſion of Parliaments, then much more in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
affairs, in which thouſands of People are included, and how much more in the affairs
of thoſe Commonalties wherein they of the P. R. R. are found to be many more in
number than the Catholicks? Every thing follows the nature of the parties; and being
the Chambers of the Edict only have the power to Judge Soveraignly of all the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Intereſts, in which they of the ſaid Religion pretend to have ſome right, how can
they conteſt againſt their Judgement in their general intereſts, who are the body and
<hi>Compoſitum</hi> whereof the others are only members and parts?</p>
               <p>For to ſay that the Commonalties ought alwayes to be eſteemed Catholicks, how great
ſoever the number be of thoſe of the P. R. R. is an allegation which cannot ſatisfie any
equitable perſons. This Maxim though it were certain, cannot be extended farther than
to reſpect things purely honourable, and where the publick authority is not only touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
but not to reſpect matters of gain, in which the queſtion is only of Intereſt; and of
this rank are the Proceſſes in which the generality cannot ſuffer, but the particulars muſt
alſo infallibly ſuffer at the ſame time. Being therefore the Edict doth ſecure the lives
and Eſtates of thoſe of the P. R. R. their Intereſts ought to be preſerved in all ſorts of
affairs, whether they be common or particular.</p>
               <p>It is in vain to reply here that the Article of the Declaration provides ſufficiently
for their Intereſt in agreeing that every one ſhould have apart, the Priviledge of his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
to the Chambers of the Edict. For beſides that this benefit, which doth only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
private perſons of the ſaid Religion, hinders not but that they may be hurt in
common: it is certain that the private perſons themſelves will find no relief for their
ſufferings. For when once they are condemned by the Parliaments in their Body, in the
Community; they will deride them when every one in particular comes to help him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
by his Priviledge, and betakes him to the Chambers of the Edicts. They will treat
them as perſons already condemned, they will hear them no more: they will deſpiſe all
their reaſons, they ſhall have brave demanding Juſtice, they will not forbear to ruine
them piecemeal, and ſend them back with their Appeal to pay thoſe ſums from which
they were exempt by the Edict.</p>
               <p>This Article therefore being ſo troubleſome, and ſo prejudicial to them of the P. R. R.
his Majeſty is moſt humbly beſought to diſcharge them thereof, without having any
regard to the Decree of the ſeventeenth of <hi>November</hi> 1664. and to permit the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Edicts the Soverain Judgement in all their Proceſs and all their differences,
with reſervation only of thoſe, whoſe Cognizance belong to the Courts of Aids and

                  <p>That according to the Declaration of 1631, and the twenty ſeventh Article of
the Edict of Nantes, in the Towns where the Conſulates and Conſul Politicks
are Miparties, the firſt Conſul ſhall be choſen out of the number of ſuch In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
as are beſt qualified, and of ability to bear Ceſſes; with prohibition
to thoſe of the P. R. R. to demand admittance to the firſt Conſulate, neither
into the Eſtates they held in the Provinces, nor in the Seſſions of the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>HItherto the Clergy have done nothing elſe but contradict the Edicts, but here they
alſo contradict themſelves. For in this Article which they have ſuggeſted, and
is a ſurpriſe, they would, that according to the Declaration of 1631, and the twenty
ſeventh Article of the Edict of <hi>Nantes,</hi> the firſt Conſul ſhould be of the C. A. R. R. and
that thoſe of the P. R. R. be not admitted to the firſt Conſulate, nor be admitted into
the Eſtates, nor into the Seſſions of the Dioceſſes. In the mean time, the twenty ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
Article of the Edict, <hi>Admits thoſe of the ſaid Religion to all Eſtates, Dignities,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:100016:26"/>
Offices, and publick Charges; as alſo it receives them into all Councils, Deliberations, Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
and Functions, which depend thereon indifferently, and without diſtinction.</hi> So that
whilſt they alledge this Article, they deſtroy it; and making ſemblance to execute it,
they utterly overturn it from top to bottom.</p>
               <p>As for the Declaration of 1631 they have but little more faithfully cited it to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty.
For here we ſee is a general ſettlement, which forbids them of the P. R. R. to
enter into the Aſſemblies of the Eſtates which are held in the Provinces. Whereas that
Declaration of 1631 was particularly for them of <hi>Languedoc</hi> and <hi>Guienne;</hi> and it ſpeaks
nothing at all of their entrance in the Aſſemblies of the Eſtates; but only of the my party
diviſion of the Conſulates and Politick Charges. It is indeed true, that the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ordains, that the firſt Conſul ſhould be always of the C. A. R. R. And becauſe of
all the Conſuls none but the firſt enters the Aſſembly of the Eſtates in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> the
ſaid Declaration by that means ſhuts the Door againſt all the Conſuls of P. R. R. in
that Province; which is a formal oppoſition to the ſaid twenty ſeventh Article of the
Edict, and they of the P. R. R. have good ground thereof to demand a revocation.
But ſo far are they at this day from repairing the wrong which they did then, that
they have aggravated it yet more, and have in divers places outed them of the P. R. R.
from the Conſulate whole and entire, which the Declaration of 1631 had only made
miparty; and now over and above all, the Clergy by an evident ſurpriſe have here ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
occaſion by an Ordinance which hath reſpect only to the Conſuls of <hi>Languedoc,</hi>
to forbid the entrance into the Aſſemblies into the Eſtates generally to all thoſe of the
<hi>P. R. R.</hi> in what part of <hi>France</hi> ſoever they live; that they might comprehend in this
excluſion thoſe perſons which have right thereto by the Edict, and which is more, which
are in peaceable poſſeſſion, and who never have been queſtioned for their entrance into,
aud rank in the Eſtates of their Country; as the Jurats of <hi>Bearn,</hi> who without diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Religion have been always for more than this hundred years received into the
Eſtates of their Province. As alſo the Lords, Gentlemen and others of this Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
who without any difficulty have been admitted into all the Eſtates of the Realm,
and who here implore the Juſtice of his Majeſty for the conſervation of their Right, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching
his Majeſty to declare, that it is not his intention to deprive them thereof.
But the ſurpriſe of the Clergy doth not ſtay here; but that which renders it altogether
inſupportable, are the laſt words where they mention <hi>the Seſſions of the Dioceſſes,</hi> this is
a Novelty which was never heard of before, and renders the condition of thoſe of the
<hi>P. R. R.</hi> wholly deplorable. Though it might well be ſaid, that as to the Eſtates, the
firſt Conſulate being taken from them of the ſaid Religion by the Declaration of 1631,
they could not, according to the terms of that Declaration, pretend to have any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
there: yet the ſame cannot be extended to the Seſſions of the Dioceſſes, for to
this day all the Conſuls from the firſt to the laſt as well of the one as of the other Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
have always without difference had entrance into theſe Seſſions of the Dioceſſes,
becauſe they are Coaequators (<hi>i.e.</hi> Aſſeſſors) born, as they ſpeak in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> that is
to ſay, that in the quality of Conſuls, they have all the right of proceeding unto the
diviſion of the Taxes, and other Impoſitions laid on the Dioceſſes by the order of the
Eſtates; the Seſſions being nothing elſe but an Aſſembly made in every Dioceſs, after
the ſitting of the Eſtates, for making neceſſary Impoſitions. Being then there is nothing
treated of in theſe Seſſions, but the diviſion of the Charges which are to be born by
them of the <hi>P. R. R.</hi> as well as others; and that all the Conſuls without exception have
right to aſſiſt there, it is juſt that they ſhould be admitted as heretofore, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of their Intereſts there. For by what juſtice can they baniſh from thoſe Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
the perſons who are to bear the greateſt part of the Charges, who pay to the King
much more than they of the C. A. R. R. becauſe they are more in number, and poſſeſs
more Lands; the difference being ſo great, that of eight parts they have ſeven in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
places; wherefore ſhall they be driven from thoſe Aſſemblies where they have ſo
great an intereſt, if not to this end, that in their abſence they may caſt on them the
whole charge to be born, that they may ruine them, and overwhelm them by unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Impoſitions, and many times contrary to the Edicts, and that they may treat them
not as Subjects of the King, and Natural French, but as Strangers and Priſoners of
War, whom they would put to their ranſom? Being then all this Article is contrary to
the Edict, and to the Liberties of thoſe of the <hi>P. R. R.</hi> and drawing after it the ruine
of their Eſtates, let it by the King's good pleaſure be caſt out of the Declaration, and
above all, the end which excludes them of the ſaid Religion from entring into the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates
and the Seſſions of the Dioceſſes; and for to ſecure their repoſe in a point of ſo
great conſequence, they do moſt humbly beſeech his Majeſty to reſcind all the Decrees,

               </argument>
               <p>THe manner then of putting this Article into execution in all Communities, being
there are divers places in the Realm, where all the Inhabitants are of the P. R. R.
is reſerved to the Parſon and his Vicar. It will therefore come to paſs, that in ſuch
places they can never aſſemble, and that the publick Affairs be wholly deſerted; where
the Voters are not above four in number, which is not at all reaſonable; and beſides
there are occaſions in which it will be impoſſible. For ſometimes Affairs occur which
concern the Parſon and other Eccleſiaſticks; ſo that in thoſe places where there are
none of the C. A. R. R. but the Parſon and his Vicar, no deliberation can poſſibly be
had in thoſe Accidents. Adde hereunto, that in many places there are ancient Statutes
which exclude the Eccleſiaſticks from entring the Town-Houſes, for that they contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
nothing to the ordinary Charges, by reaſon of their Privileges; and therefore it
is not juſt to put into their hands the conduct of the Affairs which concern the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities.
And it may alſo be feared, leſt the Affairs of the King receive prejudice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
in theſe Aſſemblies the Curats, Parſons and Vicars will have ſo great care of the

                  <p>That the Charges of the Secretaries to Conſular Houſes, Clerks to Communities,

not be held by any but Catholicks only.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IT muſt needs be, that the Clergy have a ſtrange hatred againſt thoſe of the P. R. R.
being they cannot ſuffer them to be ſo much as Clarks, Clock-keepers, or Porters.
Should not they take notice how contrary this pretenſion is to the intent of his Majeſty,
who declares, that he wills <hi>That the Edict of</hi> Nantes <hi>be exactly obſerved;</hi> that Edict
which admits indifferently, and without diſtinction in the twenty ſeventh Article, <hi>Thoſe
of the P. R. R. to all Eſtates, Dignities, Offices and Charges publick whatſoever belonging to
Knights, Nobles or Cities,</hi> of which theſe laſt are they which this Declaration terms mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicipal.
In the mean time againſt a ſettlement ſo clear repeated and confirmed in the
tenth Article of the particulars, they will not allow the leaſt employments, nor the
ſmalleſt Offices to them of this R. Ought not the Clergy to have had more reſpect to the
King's Royal Promiſe, and not to have demanded of his Majeſty things which he hath
publiſhed to the whole world, to be contrary to his will, whilſt he declares, that he will
obſerve the Edict of <hi>Nantes?</hi> But this Article doth not only combat the Edict, but it
ſurpaſſes alſo the rigour of the Declaration 1631, which imports that all the Munici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Charges ſhould be Miparties, and that one half of them ſhould be ſupplyed with
thoſe of the C. A. R. R. and the other half of the P. R. R. which is ſo well obſerved,

that the ſingle places, as thoſe of the Secretaries to the Conſular houſes, are uſed by

and ſo in order conſecutively.</p>
               <p>There are therefore no bounds to the Animoſity of the Eccleſiaſticks againſt them of
the P. R. R. In the Year 1631. they were content to demand that the Municipal Offices

it muſt be avowed, that they little conſider Reaſon ſo they ſatisfie themſelves. For Goods
and Lands being poſſeſſed by them of the P. R. R. as well as others; the inequality it
ſelf being ſo great in divers places that of eight parts thoſe of the P. R. R. poſſeſs ſeven,
as hath been already obſerved; can there be any reaſon to require that all the Titles and
the Records of Heritages and of Lands, ſhould remain in the hands of thoſe of the C. A.
R. R. to diſpoſe at their pleaſure, and to cauſe the ſubſtance of others to diſappear when they
ſhall be poſſeſſed with envy toward them, or any other emotion inſpired by the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
of their Religion, ſhall cauſe them to conceive ſuch a deſign?</p>
               <p>This is therefore an Article upon which the Juſtice of the King is implored to cauſe
it to be intirely aboliſhed, and his Majeſty may eaſily judge of how great importance
it is to retain a ſettlement ſo rigorous, in that it continually furniſheth new vexations
to his Subjects of the P. R. R. as appears by the injury done to them of <hi>Caſtres,</hi> where
under pretext of this Article which forbids them all ſingle municipal charges, they
will not permit them any longer to be Porters to the Town; notwithſtanding that this
charge is not a ſingle one, and that there are many Porters according to the number of

               <head>ARTICLE XXXII. Trades and Profeſſions.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>That in the Aſſemblies of the ſworn Maſters of Trades, the Catholicks ſhall be at
leaſt equal in number to thoſe of the P. R. R.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IT behooves that we voluntarily cloſe our eyes that we may not perceive that this
Article proceeds farther than it ſeems, and that the Clergy hath here another de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
than what appears in their words. For they know that there are places where all the
Maſters of certain Trades are of the P. R. R. for that thoſe of the C. A. R. R. neglect
thoſe Profeſſions, and apply not themſelves thereunto. From whence the Clergy could
not fail to infer, that it was impoſſible to put this Article in execution in thoſe places.
But the Eccleſiaſticks would in this affair cover another more ſecret intention. That
is, to reduce and limit the number of the Maſters in every Trade. For, if in the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of the ſworn Maſters, thoſe of the C. A. R. R. ought to be at leaſt in like num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
with them of the P. R. R. it will quickly be concluded from thence that no Maſters
are to be received, untill the number of thoſe of the Catholick A. R. R. become equal to the
others. And they will then proceed yet much farther, for then they will have the
number of the Maſters of the C. A. R. R. to be much greater than that of the others,
and that the ſame proportion is to be kept which is in every place betwixt the perſons
of both Religions. This is the reaſon that the Parliament of <hi>Normandy</hi> hath forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
the admitting of any Goldſmith, or Grocer of the P. R. R. in the Town of <hi>Rouen,</hi>
untill ſuch times as they are reduced to fifteen, that is to ſay, that for fifteen Goldſmiths
of the C. A. R. R. there can be but one of the P. R. R.</p>
               <p>That which is done in Trades is done alſo with the ſame rigour in all liberal Arts,
in all Profeſſions, and in all Imployments. It is no more poſſible to cauſe them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
any Advocates of the ſaid Religion, and the Parliament of <hi>Rouen</hi> have made a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation,
ſecret indeed, but which is executed with all poſſible exactneſs, importing that
they will not receive any more Advocates of the P. R. R. untill ſuch times as they are
reduced to the number of ten for the Parliament, two for the Preſidial Courts and
Bailywicks, and one only for the Sheriffs Courts, that is, that there be none received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Parliament for fifty years, for that half an age at leaſt will be neceſſary to make this
Reduction to the number of ten.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:100016:27"/>
In like manner they receive no more Clerks, no more Notaries nor Meſſengers, no
more Uſhers nor Serjeants, no more Attorneys. And we ſee with grief in the ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
which is made of a certain number of Attorneys in every ſeat of Judicature, they
have pitched alltogether of them of the P. R. R. that they may drive them from all the
Juriſdictions of the Realm. It is incredible that ever ſuch a Change could be ſeen to
come in an Eſtate where the Edict of <hi>Nantes</hi> hath been ſo well verified by Parliaments,
and ſo authentickly confirmed by the ſucceſſors of <hi>Henry</hi> the Great. Upon what grounds
do they interdict them of the P. R. R. of the Functions of Counſellors, Clerks or At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torneys?
what have thoſe charges common with Religion? And to exclude them of the
P. R. R. from the quality of Counſellors, is no other than to cauſe that their Innocence
and the Merits of their Cauſes ſhould be without ſupport before the Tribunals, that
they may be oppreſſed at the pleaſure of their enemies, and adverſe Parties. For to
reduce them of the P. R. R. to ſerve themſelves of no others than Councellors of the
Ca. A. R. R. were to take from them all means to defend themſelves in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
there being no likelihood that Counſellors of another Faith would take on them
to defend Intereſts of that Nature; or if they would, it muſt needs be done with ſuch
feebleneſs and negligence, that no ſucceſs could be thereupon expected.</p>
               <p>They proceed ſo far herein as not to be willing to ſuffer any Phyſitians of the P. R. R.
as if the Precepts of <hi>Hyppocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> were incompatible with the conſeſſion of the
Faith of the P. R. R. Churches. The Parliament of <hi>Rouen</hi> have limited the number of
two to that great Town, and almoſt all the Univerſities of <hi>France</hi> begin to refuſe the
Degrees of Doctor in Phyſick to thoſe of the P. R. R. notwithſtanding that we ſee the
<hi>Jews,</hi> open and declared enemies of Chriſtianity, do exerciſe this profeſſion, and fill even
the Chairs of Phyſick in the moſt famous Univerſities of <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Finally it is not ſufficient to ſay that they do at this day limit the number of thoſe
of the P. R. R. that aſpire to Profeſſions and Arts, we muſt alſo add that they exclude
them wholly. For it is not without incredible pains that any one hath admittance. And as
for Trades, they refuſe with a high hand in a manner all thoſe that offer themſelves,
without alledging any other cauſe than their Religion. This is not only ſimply to ſhut
upon them the gate to Honours and Dignities; but it is alſo to take away from them of
the ſaid Religion, all means of gaining their Lively-hood; and to condemn them cruelly
to dye of hunger; as if there were left no more humanity for them neither in their hearts
nor in their Spirits.</p>
               <p>It is true that the King hath been willing to remedy this injuſtice by his Decrees gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in Council the 28th of <hi>June,</hi> the 18th of <hi>September</hi> and 10th of <hi>November</hi> 1665.
by which it is ordained that thoſe of the P. R. R. ſhould be indifferently admitted to
Arts and Trades ſerving their Apprentiſhips, and doing their Maſter-pieces, by which
alſo the contrary Decrees of the Parliament of <hi>Rouen</hi> are reſcinded.</p>
               <p>But there are three things which grief and neceſſity force them of the ſaid Religion
to preſent before his Majeſty. The firſt is, that neither the Parliaments nor the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
Juriſdictions depending on them have any regard at all to theſe Decrees of the
Council. They make open profeſſion not to regard them, and they are not afraid to
ſay aloud that they will not yield to them at all, if the King do not expreſs himſelf
otherwiſe, nor make them underſtand his Will by a Declaration formal. In effect the
Court of Money by a Decree of the <hi>17th</hi> of <hi>December</hi> 1666. have forbidden any Maſter
of the Goldſmiths to be received in <hi>Rouen,</hi> untill ſuch times as the number of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
be ſupplyed: And thereupon the Juriſdiction of Mony in the ſaid Town hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
an Apprentice-Goldſmith to be received Maſter, and have diſmiſſed him lately
by their ſentence of the <hi>12th</hi> of <hi>July</hi> 1668.</p>
               <p>The Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> hath fined one named <hi>Magdalen de la Fond,</hi> and put her to pay
Coſts and Damages, and forbids her the exerciſe of the trade of a Linnen Merchant by
their Decree of the ſeventh of <hi>September</hi> 1665. ſomewhat more than two Months af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the firſt Decree of the Council which ordained, that thoſe of the P. R. R. ſhould be
indifferently admitted to Arts and Trades, being dated <hi>June</hi> 28, 1665. And which is
yet more aſtoniſhing, the Council it ſelf made a Decree of the like Nature, <hi>Auguſt</hi> 21
of the ſame year 1665. to forbid that there ſhould be any Linnen Merchant in <hi>Paris</hi>
of that Religion. By which one may conclude that the Decrees of the Council are not
ſufficient to eſtabliſh a certain Law, and that the Declarations of the King are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to determine affairs, eſpecially in the ſavour of them of the P. R. R. who find always
ſtrong oppoſition in the Spirits of their Judges.</p>
               <p>The Second thing to be conſidered in this place is, that the Decrees of the Council ſpeak
only of Arts and Trades, and not of Profeſſions and Charges, ſuch as be of ſmall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence,
as thoſe of Clerks which hath given them occaſion obſtinately to refuſe Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians,
Counſellors, Attorneys, Clerks, Uſhers and Serjeants by a marvellous hard uſage,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:100016:28"/>
which conſtrains them which have theſe Gifts and Talents proper for the ſervice of
the publick, to continue in forced ſilence which renders them unprofitable to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,
and which overwhelms them in confuſion; as if they were perſons notorious and
infamous, and which had deſerved for their evil Actions not to be admitted into any
honeſt profeſſion, nor received into any remarkable Employment. This is the reaſon,
that they of this Religion which perceive themſelves to have any capacity, and which
may be profitable to their Country, think of nothing elſe but to retire themſelves out
of the Realm: and the Eſtate by this means will ſee it ſelf deprived of many perſons of
merit and ſervice, by whom ſtrangers benefit themſelves to the prejudice of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third thing which ought here to be obſerved, is, that the Decrees of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
receive not them of the P. R. R. to Arts and Trades, but under condition of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentiſhips
and performing Maſter-pieces, to deprive them by this Clauſe of thoſe
Letters of Maſter-ſhip which the King hath been accuſtomed to grant upon important
and advantageous occaſions, as hath been done in favour of the general peace, the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
marriage of his Majeſty, the Birth and Baptiſm of my Lord the <hi>Dolphin.</hi> They of
the P. R. R. cannot expreſs the grief they have conceived from a Decree gotten by
ſurpriſe from the Council <hi>July</hi> 21, 1664, by which they are deprived of theſe Letters,
which are the gracious favours of their Soveraign, the refuſal whereof cannot be unto
them but moſt ſad, not only becauſe of the prejudice which they receive thereby,
but eſpecially becauſe of the diſhonour which it caſts on them. For to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
them theſe Letters of Maſterſhip, is loudly to declare them unworthy of
the leaſt Grace from their Prince: and what would they not do to recover themſelves
from this blaſting? Are they not <hi>French</hi> by Birth and Original as well as others? Take
they not part as they ought in the proſperities of the Eſtate? The general Peace, the
happy Marriage of his Majeſty, the Birth and Baptiſm of my Lord the <hi>Dauphin,</hi> and the
other advantages of the Crown and Royal Houſe, are not their hearts therewith ſenſibly
affected? Have they acted any Treachery, or any attempt which might exclude them
from thoſe Graces which diffuſe themſelves to all others Subjects? On the contrary his
Majeſty hath teſtified himſelf for them, <hi>That they have given proofs of their fidelity and
zeal beyond all he could have imagined.</hi> This is therefore a ſurpriſe made upon his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
whereby a Decree hath been obtained from the Council, wherein the rigour
proceeds ſo far as to declare them of the P. R. R. unworthy the favour of being Shooe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers,
or Joyners. They are thoſe of this R. eſpecially that have need of theſe
Letters of freedom, for that the moſt part of the Maſters of the C. A. R. R. will not
take them for Apprentices, and the Guardians being almoſt never ſatisfied with their
Maſter-pieces, the entrance into Trades in this way is to them ordinarily impoſſible.
Beſides theſe Letters have never been denyed them hitherto, they have always very eaſily
obtained them; they peaceably enjoyed them; and this hath made their refuſal more
pungent and afflicting. But above all this they cannot ſufficiently complain of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice
of the Parliaments, who overbearing that infallible Maxim of Right, that no
Law hath any effect but for the time to come, would this notwithſtanding, that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
of the Council of <hi>July</hi> 21, 1664. which deprives thoſe of the P. R. R. of the
Letters of Maſterſhip, ſhould have a virtue retroactive. For they condemned thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
to ſhut up their Shops, who in conſequence of ſuch Letters were admitted Maſters,
and who had many years before exerciſed their Trades.</p>
               <p>Therefore the King is moſt humbly beſought to redreſs this: and for to ſtay thoſe
diſorders which caſt his Subjects of the P. R. R. into a famine worſe than that which
comes through the barrenneſs of the Earth, or which will force them to ſeek their Bread
in ſtrange Countries, as many in conſiderable numbers have done already, to the
great prejudice of the Trade, and Manufactures of the Realm; his Majeſty will be
pleaſed to ordain, that they of the ſaid Religion may not be refuſed upon what
pretext ſoever it be to be admitted into Arts, and into Trades, and that they be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
indifferently, whether it be by Letters of Maſterſhip, or Apprentiſhips, or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-pieces;
and that thoſe who have heretofore obtained Letters of Maſterſhip may
not be hindred to make uſe thereof, and that at length thoſe of the ſaid Religion may
be admitted into all ſorts of Profeſſions, of Arts and Trades, without reſtriction or
limitation of number, that they may enjoy all the rights, and perform all the Functions
which depend thereon. And that his Majeſty would have the goodneſs to inſert this
into a Declaration in good form, that may not leave any more place of diſobedience to
paſſionate Judges and Officers.</p>

how then can it be poſſible for thoſe who are in an Aſſembly to know when they

will not fail to fall on them, and draw them into Law, and condemn them to pay great

               <argument>
                  <p>Thoſe of the ſaid P. R. R. ſhall be obliged to ſuffer their Houſes to be hung in the
Streets by the authority of the Officers of the place, and other places appertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

clean before their doors.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IT is true, that by the third of the private Articles of the Edict of <hi>Nantes,</hi> they
of the P. R. R. are obliged to ſuffer Hangings to be put up before their Houſes, but
not to clean the Streets before their Doors. This is an Addition to the Law, and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:100016:29"/>
which appears alſo contrary to the Law, for that the Edict in the ſixth general Article
doth expreſly ſignifie, that thoſe of the <hi>P. R. R. may not be conſtrained to do any thing
to any Religious Purpoſe againſt their Conſcience.</hi> They then humbly beſeech his Majeſty
to diſpenſe with them for ſweeping before their Doors, on the occaſion of the Feaſts,
becauſe this is a thing repugnant unto their Conſciences, being done as a Religious Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony,
which their Faith approves not of. This alſo will be after a ſhort ſeaſon a
matter of Suit alſo; becauſe they will always pretend that they have not ſwept clean
enough; and there will be found people ſo ill diſpoſed, as to caſt ordure before their
Doors, to the intent they may make them criminal Offenders. For this cauſe, being the
Civil Ordinances are ſufficient for cleanſing the Pavements of Towns, and thoſe of the
P. R. R. are at all times very careful to acquit themſelves well herein before their Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;
there is no need of the laſt Clauſe of this Article, and his Majeſty is beſought to
revoke it.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>That thoſe of the Pretended R. R. meeting the Holy Sacrament in the Streets,
carried abroad to the ſick, or otherwiſe, be obliged to retire at the ſound of
the Bell which goes before it; or if not, to put themſelves in a poſture of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
by putting off their Hats, if they be men, with prohibition that they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
not at the Doors, Shops, nor Windows of their Houſes, whilſt the Holy
Sacrament paſſeth, unleſs they put themſelves in ſuch poſture.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BEing the King leaves unto them of the P. R. R. the liberty of the Alternative, and
permits them to retire in theſe incident caſes; they never give cauſe to complain of
them. But they find themſelves conſtrained in this matter to repreſent three things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Majeſty.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, that they are always in theſe occaſions hindred from retiring; the way
is ſtopped, the doors of the Houſes are ſhut upon them, they are held by force, they
are outraged, they are laid on with Blows, after all this they are over and above pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,
as not retiring: his Majeſty is therefore beſought to add unto this Article,
<hi>That no hindrance be made to them that would retire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that thoſe who attempt to ſtay, force,
or outrage them in any manner whatſoever, be puniſhed as diſturbers of the publick peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond is, that whereas in this Article nothing is ſaid ſave only of meetings in the
Streets, many flye out ſo far as to require them to put off their Hats, who are cloſed in
Chambers and Houſes, and in caſe they refuſe, they make criminal proceſs againſt them,
and hold them a long ſeaſon in priſon without any other cauſe, by an unexcuſable vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.
So far that they would even oblige the Councellors of the P. R. R. to be unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
when they are within the Tarreſs, where the object of the Adoration of thoſe of
C. A. R. R. is neither ſeen, nor perceived, and whence it is not poſſible for them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire.
His Majeſty is therefore beſought to declare, <hi>That this Article is not extended, but
to thoſe meetings which happen in the Street only, and not otherwiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third thing is, that the Parliament of <hi>Rouen,</hi> in verifying the King's Declaration
have much aggravated this Article. For whereas the King obliges thoſe that will not
retire, only to put off the Hat, which reſpects men only, and inſiſts on an action leſs
than bending of the Knee; the Parliament extending the rigour of this Authority a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
both the Sexes, have carried it on ſo far, as to command: <hi>That they ſhould put
themſelves in the ſame obſervance as the Catholicks,</hi> that is to ſay, to kneel: which cannot
be reaſonably exacted of them of the P. R. R. ſo long as they are left in the liberty of
their Faith. Therefore his Majeſty expounding this Article in the manner which hath
been repreſented, may be pleaſed to forbid to hinder them who would retire, or, to do
them any diſpleaſure; by declaring that this Article is not to be extended, ſave only to
meetings which happen in the Streets, without having any regard to the verification of
the Parliament of <hi>Rouen,</hi> which he diſcharges, as contrary to his intention.</p>

               <p>NOthing ſhould have been ſaid to this Article, if the zeal which they of the P. R. R.
have for the ſervice of the King, had not obliged them to ſpeak thereto. For
it is certain that thoſe who have ſuggeſted this ſettlement in thinking to hurt them,
have done nothing but to the prejudice of his Majeſties affairs. The reaſon is manifeſt
which is this, that the Collectors of the Taxes of the Provinces of <hi>Guienne</hi> and <hi>Langue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doc,</hi>
making at the ſame time the Levies of the Money appointed for the entertainment

               <argument>
                  <p>That according to the ſecond Article of the Particulars of the Edict of Nantes,
the Artiſans of the ſaid P. R. R. may not be obliged to contribute to the Charges
of Chappels, Fraternities, or other the like; if there be not Statutes, Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
or Foundations to the contrary: and yet notwithſtanding that they may be
conſtrained to contribute and pay the rights which are ordinarily paid by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
and the Freemen, of the ſaid Trades, that the ſaid Sums may be imployed
to the relief of the Poor of the ſaid Trades, and other neceſſities and affairs of the
Trade.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe Clergy who ſee that it is the intention of his Majeſty in his Declarations <hi>to cauſe
the Edict of</hi> Nantes <hi>to be exactly obſerved,</hi> imploy all their Force and Art to ruine the
Edict, whilſt they make ſhew to conform themſelves to it, and in ſearching out Biaſes
which may give it ſome ſuppoſed ſenſes, whereby they may turn it againſt them whoſe
Protection it undertakes. This is the Principal Artifice of the Eccleſiaſticks. This is
that wherby they think to caſt powder in the eyes, and this method appears in no part
of theſe Declarations more naked than in this Article. For here we ſee the ſecond
Article of the particulars of the Edict of <hi>Nantes</hi> cited, by which the Artiſans of the
P. R. R. are diſcharged from contributing to the Charges of Chappels and Fraternities.
But we find three wayes practiſed to make this Article unprofitable to them of the ſaid
Religion; and to imploy it even againſt them.</p>
               <p>The Firſt is, that they apply to the Fraternities the exception which is found in that
Article, when it ſaith, <hi>Except they have any Foundations, Donations, or other Settlements
made by themſelves or their Predeceſſors.</hi> And yet it is certain that the Foundations and
Donations have no reſpect unto the Brother-hoods, but only to the other things ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in that Article, as Churches and Chappels.</p>
               <p>The Second means is, that by an ingenious ſhift whilſt they diſcharge the Artiſans of
the ſaid Religion from contributing to the charges of Chappels, and Brother-hoods, and
ſuch like; they condemn them nevertheleſs to pay the ſame ſums from which they exempt
them, to be imployed to the relief of the Poor, and neceſſitous of their Trades. This
is directly to pull away with one hand what they will not receive with the other. The
King hath not the terms of his Declaration ſo intended; being in this place equivocal,
thoſe perſons which are enemies to them of the P. R. R. will never fail readily to give it
an inconvenient ſence. Therefore his Majeſty is beſought to expound himſelf, and to
make it known that in ſubjecting the Maſters and Artiſans of this Religion to the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the dues to the Trades, he hath not intended thoſe which are paid to the
ſervices and Devotions of the Guildes; but only thoſe which the Maſters of the one and
the other Religion are obliged to pay for the relief of the poor, and for the ſuſtaining
the affairs of their Trade which are purely politick.</p>
               <p>The Third is much more conſiderable and dangerous, which is, that in this Article
of the Declaration they have inſerted the word <hi>Statutes,</hi> which is not found in the ſecond
Article of the Particulars of <hi>Nantes;</hi> and by this word <hi>Statutes</hi> they will elude the whole
ſettlement of the Edict. For there is no Guild which hath not its Statutes, ſo that they
of the P. R. R. ſhall find themſelves bound by the force of this word, to contribute to
all the Guilds, to the prejudice of the Edict which exempts them from doing any thing
contrary to their Conſciences. And that they may leave them of the ſaid Religion no
hope of ſaving themſelves therefrom, they have contrived of late to make new Statutes
for their Trades, obliging the Maſters to cauſe Maſſes to be ſaid, expreſly to this intent,
that they may ſubject them to the charge of the Service of the Guilds from which the
Edict hath exempted them. Yea, and by vertue of theſe new invented Statutes they
will pretend to exclude all thoſe of the P. R. R. from Trades, becauſe there are found in
them Articles which oblige the Maſters to the Service and Ceremonies of the C. A. R. R.
Church, and which amount to thus much that none ſhall be admitted Maſters who make
no profeſſion of the C. A. R. R. And becauſe theſe Statutes are made ſince the Edict of
<hi>Nantes,</hi> they will maintain that they do derogate therefrom. His Majeſty therefore to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate
this miſchief which is contrary to his intention, and to the Decrees of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
will be pleaſed to hear the moſt humble Petition which his Subjects of the P. R. R.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:100016:30"/>

matter of Chappels and Guilds, with the ſecond Article of the particulars of <hi>Nantes,</hi>
and to expell out of his Ordinance, the word <hi>Statutes,</hi> which is not found in the Edict;
and acording to his equitable wiſdom to impede thoſe new Statutes which they would
eſtabliſh in the Trades; or at leaſt to cauſe them to withdraw the Articles which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
the difference of the two Religions, as being of great prejudice to the traffick and
behoof of the Publick, which thereby will be found moſt remarkably injured.</p>

                  <p>That thoſe of the ſaid Religion may not ſuborn the Catholicks, nor induce them to
change their Religion under any pretext whatſoever; and that the Catholicks which
ſhall abjure their Religion may not be married for ſix months after their

               </argument>
               <p>PUre and ſimple ſubornation which is not accompanied with Violence, nor Threats,
nor Promiſes, nor Preſents, hath no reference to thoſe that are of Age; for that
they being of age to know, diſcern, and chooſe, are capable to defend themſelves from
ſuborners; and when they ſuffer themſelves to be perſwaded to any thing, it is by an
acquieſcence of the Soul altogether free, which is carried of its ſelf to imbrace that
which it eſteemeth reaſonable; and this is the cauſe alſo why the <hi>18th</hi> Article of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
of <hi>Nantes,</hi> which forbids inducement to the change of Religion, ſpeaks only of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,
willing that they ſhould not be induced to this change without the conſent of
their Parents. And the ſame Article makes the prohibition reciprocal for them of the
one and the other Religion under the ſame pains; Yet beginning at the Children of thoſe
of the P. R. R. becauſe they are in effect more expoſed to this danger.</p>
               <p>According to this model his Majeſty is beſought to cauſe this Article of the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
to be reformed, reſtraining it to Infants and Minors, who only are capable of
being ſuborned in the manner which hath been above deſcribed. For as to others who
are at the age of reaſon and choice, what would follow if it were forbidden to induce
them to change their Religion? how many Miſchiefs and troubles would this Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
occaſion? For they would pretend that it were no more permitted unto any perſon
of the P. R. R. to talk at all in any manner of his Faith, no nor to render a reaſon
thereof to them who ſhall come to queſtion them about their belief. If one touch up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any point in diſcourſe, if one lend any book of Religion to thoſe who intreat it,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:100016:31"/>
if one inſtruct even his own Children in the preſence of any of the R. C. A. R. Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
they will pretend that he had a deſign to induce and ſuborn them to change their
Religion and put him in trouble with Proceſs.</p>
               <p>So will there be no more liberty of Conſcience in the Realm, there will be no more
ſecurity for Maſters of Families of the P. R. R. in their houſes, for if they are about to
chaſtiſe their Servants, or houſhould, they to revenge themſelves, may accuſe them to
have gone about to ſuborn them. This alſo would be a pretext to dive into the ſecrets
of Families, and to introduce a kind of inquiſition into <hi>France,</hi> againſt the liberties not
only accorded to by the Edicts, but alwayes eſtabliſhed in this Realm. There can then
be nothing more equitable than to reſtore and bring back this Article of the Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the terms of the 18th of the Edict, forbidding as well thoſe of the C. A. R. as thoſe

This is a Decree quite contrary to this Article; and which ordains that the Catholick
Inhabitants of the Town of <hi>Privas,</hi> who have purchaſed the Houſes and Inheritances
of thoſe of the P. R. R. of the ſame place, obliged or condemned with the other inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants

               <p>The nature of things hath not changed ſince 1661. The rules of Reaſon, Right and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,

ſhould change the nature of Contracts and obligations; and introduce this novelty in
Commerce, that thoſe who are Debtors, ceaſe ſo to be, to the prejudice of their Creditors,
who have lent them their Money upon their Credit, and upon juſt confidence they had
upon the validity of publick Acts, by which they who borrowed their Money, became
their debtors? The King will never conſent to a favour or priviledge to the prejudice
of others: But here the favour which they would ſhew to theſe new Converts turns to
the damage, and it may be even to the ruine of their Creditors, whoſe Bond may not
only happen to be relaxed by the diſcharge of ſome of their Debtors: But it may fall
out alſo that all his Obliges becoming Converts, ſome one man may looſe all his whole
debt in general, and ſo may ſee himſelf reduced to beggery. If the King would except
theſe Converts, it would ſeem neceſſary for him to reconcile his Grace with his Juſtice,
that his Majeſty would be pleaſed to pay their debts, and to diſcharge them with his
own Money. Otherwiſe this were to give away the Eſtate of another, and to cauſe a

               <p>It is alſo a thing worthy to be conſidered that in the Provinces of <hi>Languedoc</hi> and <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enne,</hi>
the debts contracted by Bodies Corporate are Charges real, which follow the
Land and immovable goods, into what hands ſoever they paſs. Becauſe the poſſeſſor is
obliged to pay his part according to the proportion of his Inheritances, when they
come to the diviſion of theſe debts. How then can the Converts be reaſonably diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
of theſe debts, being their obligation is not only perſonal but real alſo, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecteth
the Lands which they poſſeſs, and whoſe enjoyment by conſequence is a ſufficient
title againſt them to make them liable unto this payment?</p>
               <p>How great ſoever this matter of complaint is in it ſelf; yet it muſt here be added
that they go about to make it yet more inſupportable. For although this Article is
not extended farther than the debts of Communalties, yet there are many notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
ſo abſurd as to deſire to extend it to particular debts, and to make uſe of
their Converſion as an infallible means to croſs the Books of the Merchants of the
P. R. R. of the ſums of which the new Converts find themſelves accountable, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh
and acquit all the rents with which they ſhall be charged, and to cancel all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
by which they are held obliged to them of the ſaid Religion.</p>
               <p>The King without doubt never intended to authorize an imagination ſo unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
This were to do outrage to the Chriſtian Religion, to make it ſerve a deſign ſo

paying their Creditors of the ſaid Religion their perſonal and particular debts, with

               <p>IT is hard to comprehend the ſenſe of this Article, for it contains an evident contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.
It imports that the Temples and Burying places ſhould not be left out of

               <argument>
                  <p>That the Children whoſe Fathers are or have been Catholicks, ſhall be Baptized and
brought up in the C. C. though their Mothers be of the P. R. R. and alſo the
Children whoſe Fathers are departed in the ſaid C. R. ſhall be brought up in the
ſaid Religion; for which purpoſe they ſhall be committed to the hands of their
Mothers, Tutors, or other Kindred which are Catholicks, upon demand; with
expreſs prohibition to lead the ſaid Children to the Temples or Schools of the ſaid
P. R. R. or to bring them up therein, albeit their Mothers be of the ſaid P. R. R.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BEing Fathers have nothing more clear than their Children, this Article doth cauſe
alſo an inexpreſſible grief to them of the P. R. R. Becauſe it takes away from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
amongſt them the liberty of cauſing their own Children to be Baptized and brought
up in the Religion which they Profeſs, upon pretence that they have ſometimes
been Catholicks. If this Article had ſpoken only of Parents who are or who dye in the
C. A. R. R. it would have been thought leſs ſtrange. But to require that a man ſhould
not Baptize his Child in the Communion in which he lives, becauſe he hath been of
another Religion 30 or 40 years before; certainly is a ſeverity ſufficient to throw a
man into deſpair. Beſides, here is alſo a Contradiction in this very Article, which
ſpeaks not only of Fathers <hi>which are,</hi> but which have been Catholicks. For wherefore
will they that Infants, born of a Catholick Father, ſhould be Baptized and brought up in
the Catholick Church. It is without doubt becauſe it is juſt and reaſonable that the
Children ſhould follow the Religion of their Fathers, when as yet they are not of age
nor in Eſtate to chooſe one. And by the ſame reaſon the children of thoſe who actually
profeſs the P. R. R. ought not they be Baptized and trained up in the ſame Religion,
being the ſame with their Fathers, and wherein they were born, and being that whilſt
they are yet in their Infancy, they are not capable to chooſe a different one? This were
to tear away from Fathers their Bowels, thus to raviſh from them their Infants, and to
cauſe them to be Baptized in a Church, and inſtructed in a Religion which they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced.
And we muſt talk no more of Liberty of Conſcience in a Realm, where it
is given and authorized ſolemnly by ſo many Edicts, if this prohibition take place.
This is to chaſe out of <hi>France</hi> all thoſe perſons how many ſoever there be who have
imbraced the pretended Reformed Religion within this eighty years. For where is
that Father that can reſolve to ſee his Infants in whom he hopes to live after his Death,
lead whether he will or not into a Communion from whom he is retired, as not finding
there any repoſe for his Conſcience? where is there a father that can digeſt the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
diſpleaſure to ſee himſelf bereaved of the fruits of his Marriage, and to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
afterwards to pay them a Penſion, as we have ſeen examples in divers
places, and particularly in <hi>Rouen</hi> in the perſon of one named <hi>Bindel</hi> Painter, whoſe
Children are brought up in this manner. If then his Majeſty be touched with any
Compaſſion towards his poor and humble Subjects of the P. R. R. he is beſought here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
to lend an ear unto their grief, and cauſe theſe terms to be put out of this preſent
Article, which ſeem to have been ſlipped into it, and added thereto by ſurprize againſt
the intention of ſo wiſe a Soveraign.</p>
               <p>For the other part of this Article which imports that the Infants, whoſe Fathers are
departed in the Catholick Religion ſhall be brought up in the ſame Religion; they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
not at all againſt it, provided it be intended of Infants that are under twelve
years for Fe-males, and fourteen years Males, according to the Decrees of the Council,
regulating the age from which Infants may change their Religion. But here is cauſe to
complain of two things in this matter.</p>
               <p>The one, that notwithſtanding by the Edict of <hi>Nantes,</hi> and by two Decrees made
in Council of the twenty eighth of <hi>September</hi> 1663, and of the twenty fourth of
<hi>April,</hi> 1665. the ſame thing hath been Decreed for the Infants whoſe Fathers have dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the P. R. R, <hi>i. e.</hi> that their Infants ſhould be brought up in the ſame Religion,
and for this purpoſe ſhould be committed into the hands of their Mothers, Tutors, or
other kindred of the pretended Reformed Religion: Yet notwithſtanding they have nor
here made this Article reciprocal. From whence they may in time infer that in this
they have derogated from the Edict and Decrees of the Council which were before. For
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:100016:33"/>
this cauſe the King rejecting theſe words <hi>which have been,</hi> will be pleaſed to render
this Article reciprocal for them of the P. R. R. as well as for them of the C. A. R.</p>
               <p>The other cauſe of complaint is, that even ſince the two Decrees came to be publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
they have not ceaſed to hale away alſo by force from the Kindred of the P. R. R.
Infants whoſe Fathers and Mothers have alwayes been of this Religion and dyed therein.
Moreover now very lately, the Parliament of <hi>Rouen</hi> by an Arreſt of the firſt of <hi>Februa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
1668. have decreed that a little Maid whoſe Father and Mother were departed in the
P. R. R. ſhould be taken out of the hands of her Kindred of that Religion, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
they offered to bring her up for nothing, that ſhe might be put into the hands
of her Tutor who is of the C. A. R. The reaſon which ſerves them to authorize ſuch
violences to the prejudice of the preceding Decrees is, ſay they, becauſe theſe Decrees
of the Council are not Regiſtred, and by conſequence oblige not, albeit that the laſt of the
fourteenth of <hi>April,</hi> 1665. enjoynes all Officers to be conformable thereunto, and to cauſe
it to be executed under pain of Rebellion. The King therefore to give ſome means
unto his Subjects of the P. R. R. whereby his orders may take effect in this important
matter, is beſought to make thereof an Authentick Declaration which may be Regiſtred
in the Parliaments.</p>

               <head>ARTICLE XLVI. Schools.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>That they of the ſaid P. R. R. may not keep any Schools for the inſtruction of
their own Children or others, but in places where they have right to the publick
exerciſe of their Religion, according to the 13th Article of the particulars of
the Edict of Nantes, in which Schools whether they be in the Towns or in the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burbs,
they may not teach ſave only to Read, Write, and Arithmetick.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>TO underſtand well what the Schools of thoſe of the P. R. R. are, it is neceſſary to
obſerve that they are of three ſorts. The firſt are their Academies and Colledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
where they teach their Divinity. The ſecond are publick Schools where they may
teach Grammar and Humane Learning with open doors. The third ſort are particular
petty Schools which they keep with their doors ſhut, where the Infants of the ſaid Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
learn to Read, Write, and Arithmetick only.</p>
               <p>For their Academies and Colledges they are fixed to certain places, and they ſhall not
be inſiſted on here, becauſe this Article deals not with their concerns.</p>
               <p>For the publick Schools, the Edict permits them in all Towns, and in all places, where
the exerciſe is publick, as the 37th Article of the Particulars, doth prove, <hi>They of the
ſaid Religion</hi> (ſaith it) <hi>may not keep publick Schools, ſave only in the Towns and places where
the publick Exerciſe thereof is permitted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But as for petty Schools, the Edict ſuppoſeth them as permitted in all places indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
by natural reaſon and equity, which authoriſes Fathers no leſs to give inſtruction
than bread unto their Children, and as well to nouriſh their Spirits by a familiar In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
as to ſuſtain their Bodies by an ordinary nouriſhment. So that it cannot be
doubted that this is the intent of the Edict, for that when it forbids to have Schools
elſewhere than in places where the Exerciſe is permitted; it ſpeaks expreſly of publick
Schools; whence it reſults, that it leaves a liberty for particular Schools in other places
where the publick Exerciſe is not had. In effect, this practice hath alwayes been fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
ſince the Edict, and Parliaments have formally authorized this uſage by their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees.
The Parliament of <hi>Rouen</hi> have granted many on this occaſion and two remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ones, amongſt others, The one in the Month of <hi>May,</hi> 1605. By which, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the oppoſition of the Abbeſs of <hi>Montivilliers,</hi> one named <hi>Haiſe</hi> was permitted
to teach to Write, and Read in that Town of <hi>Montivilliers,</hi> notwithſtanding that there
was no exerciſe of the P. R. R. neither in the Town nor in the Suburbs, nor within
more than two Leagues round about; upon condition only that he might not dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matize.</p>
               <p>The other was of the firſt of <hi>February;</hi> 1623. by which the ſame thing was permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to one named <hi>Poignant</hi> under the ſame condition, not to dogmatize, and not to uſe
the Prayers of his Religion in the Pariſh of St. <hi>Anthony</hi> of the Forreſt, where the ſaid Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
was not at all eſtabliſhed: and this, notwithſtanding the oppoſition of the Official
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:100016:33"/>
of <hi>Rouen,</hi> ſince which time, the thing hath not been any more diſputed; and they of
the P. R. R. have not been troubled untill theſe laſt years, in which the hatred which
many perſons bear unto them, hath been permitted, all things without reſtraint, they
have been deſirous to forbid them theſe particular petty Schools in all places. And the
ſame hath paſſed even to that exceſs, as to forbid Maſters to go teach Children in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
houſes: And to heap up this meaſure, it is carried on to a refuſal of receiving Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of the Arts of Writing and Arithmetick, as this may be ſeen all in one Decree of the
Parliament of <hi>Rouen</hi> made againſt one named <hi>du Perry.</hi> This is one of the evils of which
they of the P. R. R. do complain with the greateſt ſorrow; This is one of thoſe for
which they have the leaſt pretext. For what danger can there riſe from theſe petty
and obſcure Schools, which are rather a mark of the weakneſs of thoſe of this R. then of
their Power? Is it then a Crime for their Children to read and write? will they bring
Proceſs againſt a man for putting a pen into the hands of a ſimple flock of Infants which
come to ſeek him in his Chamber without noiſe or ſhew? and ſhall Fathers be compelled
to let their Children live like Beaſts, or ſend them to Maſters whom they ſuſpect, or ſend
them two or three Leagues from their houſes to find there a Maſter of the Religion
which they profeſs?</p>
               <p>The diſtinction which here is made of the Schools of thoſe of the P. R. R. ſhews
clearly how many ſurprizes are to be found in this forty ſixth Article of the Declaration.
For firſt, The thirteenth Article of the Edict of <hi>Nantes,</hi> is cited to prove that they of
the ſaid Religion may not have any Schools, but in the places where they have publick
Exerciſe; and yet it ſpeaks only in the thirteenth Article of the <hi>Inſtruction of Infants in
that which concerns Religion;</hi> an evident proof, that in the places where the exerciſe is not
publick, it is permitted to them of the P. R. R. to have other Schools, that is, ſuch
as intermeddle not at all with Religion, and where they are taught nothing but Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that is purely humane. Secondly, The Article of the Declaration wills, that in the
Schools whether they be in Towns, or in Suburbs, where the Exerciſe of the ſaid Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
is eſtabliſhed, they may teach to Read, Write, and Arithmetick only, which is
true indeed of the particular petty Schools which may be kept indifferently in all places
with their doors ſhut, but not of the publick Schools which are authorized by the 37th
Article of the Particulars. For that Article doth not reſtrain the permiſſion of thoſe
Schools to Reading nor to Writing, nor to Arithmetick alone, but leaves them the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
liberty of Schools, to give the ſame Leſſons there which they Practiſe in other
Schools of the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Therefore to bring back and reſtore theſe things to the ſettlement in the Edict, it
is juſt and neceſſary to permit publick Schools in all the Towns and all the places where
the publick Exercize of the ſaid P. R. R. is had: and to conſent to the Particular petty
Schools in all places of the Realm. This is that concerning which his Majeſty is moſt
humbly beſought; as alſo to ſtay the courſe of the devices and injuſtice which is done
to them of the ſaid Religion concerning their Schools. For they do continually raiſe
Suits againſt them about the word <hi>Places,</hi> which is found in the Edict of <hi>Nantes,</hi>
when it is ſaid, <hi>that they may not have publick Schools but in the Towns and Places where their
Exerciſe is permitted;</hi> there are many who have the rigour to deſire to oblige them to
keep their Schools in the ſame place with their Exerciſe, <hi>i.e.</hi> within the encloſure of
their Temples: Notwithſtanding that King <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth expounded himſelf in this
matter, by his anſwer to the paper of 1612, Art. 9. wherein he conſented that the
Children of the Towns and Suburbs ſhould have Schools in the Towns and Suburbs
where the exerciſe of their Religion was permitted: and that the Children of the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
Villages round about ſhould have Schools in the Suburbs. Wherefore to hinder us a
vexation ſo ill conceived, his Majeſty is moſt humbly beſought to renew this explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and to declare, that by the places of publick Schools permitted to them of the P. R. R.
he intends the Townes or Suburbs where the Exercize is publickly enjoyed, and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
extended to the Suburbs, Burrows, and Villages where they have the right of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe,

For every one may uſe his Houſe, his Table, and his Time as ſeems good unto himſelf,

               </argument>
               <p>HEre we have the moſt important Article of all the Declaration. There is nothing
more contrary to them of the pretended Reformed Religion, nothing more capable
to trouble the publick Tranquility, nor to cauſe ſo deadly conſequences of all ſorts. For
it is in Sickneſs, and above all, at the approach of Death, that men have the greateſt
need of repoſe, and that trouble is to them moſt inſupportable; for that being other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
ſufficiently toyled, they cannot indure to be moleſted in that Eſtate, nor to be
hindred in the injoyment of the Peace and comfort of their ſouls, the Salvation whereof
is then their ſole Intereſt.</p>
               <p>The Clergy in their other Articles have ſtriven to take from them of the P. R. R.
the means to live, in this they come to deprive them of the liberty of dying in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of their Faith, againſt that ſo expreſs ſettlement of the Edict of <hi>Nantes</hi> in the
14th Article of the Particulars, <hi>They of the ſaid Religion</hi> (ſaith it,) <hi>ſhall not be obliged to
receive exhortations when they are ſick and nigh unto Death, whether it be by Condemnation of
Juſtice or otherwiſe, of others than they of the ſame Religion; and they may be viſited and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted
by their Miniſters, without being moleſted.</hi> And this point was judged to be of ſo
great conſequence that the King ratified it by his anſwer of 1636. Art. 19. For his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
there Ordained, <hi>that the fourth Article of the particulars of the Edict of</hi> Nantes <hi>ſhould
be entirely obſerved, with injunction to his Officers to hold their hand therein, on pain to anſwer
it in their proper and private names.</hi> Can there be any thing more oppoſite to the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
The Edict of <hi>Nantes</hi> wills that the ſick of the P. R. R. ſhall not be obliged to
receive Exhortations of others than thoſe of their own Religion, and the Declaration
on the contrary wills, that they be obliged to ſuffer the Pariſh Prieſts and Aldermen to
enter into their houſes without their conſents, and without being called. How ſhall we
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:100016:34"/>
agree theſe two ſettlements ſo contrary? For to ſay that the Declaration only permits
the Pariſh Prieſts to preſents themſelves to the ſick to know their minds, not to make
any exhortations unto them, this is in truth to ſay nothing at all. For where is the
Pariſh Prieſt that ſeeing himſelf Maſter of the Chamber of a ſick perſon, will not adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to ſpeak ſomewhat unto him for to gain him? And if any attempt to hinder him,
what uproar and what Miſchief ſhall not follow upon it? They will cry Rebellion againſt
thoſe that aſſiſt the ſick. They will pretend that they offer violence to the Pariſh Prieſt
who making himſelf to be heard through the Windows, the neighbourhood and almoſt
all the people will run thither in a tumult, break open the doors, throw themſelves in a
fury into the Chamber of the poor agoniſing perſon, who ſhall at the ſame time ſee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
miſerably moleſted, all his Family terrified and diſcomforted, at what time as he ought
to be left in repoſe, to bethink himſelf of his Salvation. And how many other Miſchiefs
will this permiſſion given to the Pariſh Prieſts draw after it? For the leaſt word that
one can ſay to them to free ones ſelf from their urgencies and importunities ſhall be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
for an attempt on his perſon; their perſons ſhall be ſeized who let fall any word
wherewith they are not ſatisfied, they will drag them to Priſon, they will in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
condemn them to ſo great Fines and ſuch rigorous reparations, as are to be ſeen
by divers examples in many places. Humanity it ſelf ought to oblige unto more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
to Families who are in ſorrow, and not to eſtabliſh means to give trouble over
and above to a wife that hath more than enough by the ſickneſs of her Husband, or to
a mother that is weeping over a Child ready to give up the Ghoſt, or to Children that
have their hearts wounded for the ſad eſtate of their Father.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, if a man be in a Phrenzy by the heat of a violent Feaver, and he in the
diſtraction of his ſpirit let fall any word conrary to his intention before the Pariſh
Prieſt; they will quickly lay hold on it as a good and formal Converſion, and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
they will drive out of his Chamber all thoſe that attend him: They will hale away
the Wife from her Husband, and the Husband from his Wife, under pretext that the ſick
hath changed his Religion, and ought to have the liberty of his Conſcience.</p>
               <p>And if any perſon dye in this Phrenſie, they will ſeize on his Body, and interr him
after the Ceremonies of the C. A. R. R. though he never had any thoughts on it. Yea,
and force his Children to leave the Church wherein they were born, and paſs over to
that in which they pretend their Father dyed, by vertue of the 45th Article of this
Declaration, which imports, <hi>That the Children of the Fathers, who departed in the R. C. A. R.
Should be brought up in the ſaid Religion.</hi> But if the ſick man eſcape, they will conſtrain him
to go unto the Maſs, and hinder him from returning to the P. R. R. by vertue of the
Declaration againſt the Relapſed, though he never thought in the leaſt to quit his belief;
and if he have ſaid any thing it hath been the pure effect of his Feaver, in a time when
he knew not what he ſaid, and when he was not himſelf. And above all this, they will
conſtrain his Children alſo to go unto the Maſs, in conſequence of this Declaration, which
in the 45th Article Ordains, <hi>That Infants whoſe Fathers have been Catholicks ſhall be brought
up in the Catholick Church.</hi> Is it poſſible to be any miſery like to this?</p>
               <p>There is alſo herein another inconvenience which muſt not here be forgotten: which
is, that the Pariſh Prieſts, when they preſent themſelves to the ſick, put to them cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
and artificial queſtions, upon deſign to entangle and ſurprize them, for example,
they will ask them <hi>whether they would not be of the true Faith? whether they be not willing to
believe the pure and ſound Doctrine? whether they would not live and dye in the true Church?</hi>
and other ſuch like things. To which, if a man anſwer only one, <hi>Yes,</hi> Immediately
they take this word for an abjuration, and at the ſame time they put his friends from him,
becauſe they pretend by this one <hi>Yes,</hi> that the man is become a good Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.</p>
               <p>They muſt not pretend to put them of the P. R. R. into ſhelter againſt all theſe
diſorders, by the preſence of the Judge and the Magiſtrate, whom the Declaration wills
to accompany the Pariſh Prieſts. For the Pariſh Prieſts? will chooſe the Judges and
Officers according to their liking; and they will find many as ill-diſpoſed as the Pariſh
Prieſts themſelves; and who far from moderating them, will puſh them on to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
any thing. So that their preſence inſtead of helping, many times will hurt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it giveth more authority to that which he doth, and the ſick and his friends are
leſs able to cauſe a Judge to depart, than a ſimple Pariſh Prieſt.</p>
               <p>But if on the other hand the Pariſh Prieſt and the Judge tranſported with zeal, be
minded to report the Declaration of the Sick otherwiſe than he hath made it, what
means hath he to make the truth known? will he oppoſe the Teſtimony of his friends
and the ſtanders by? why they will be ſuſpected, and ſhall not be believed to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
of the Judge and the Pariſh Prieſt. Neither ſhall they for the moſt part of the
time ſerve themſelves of their Teſtimony, becauſe the Judges and Pariſh Prieſts do
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:100016:35"/>
commonly ſend all people out of the ſick mans Chamber whereinto they enter, this is a
Miſchief for which there is no remedy but by revocation of this Article.</p>
               <p>For the other Eccleſiaſticks and Religious, it may ſeem that the declaration doth not
give them ſo much power, becauſe it wills that they be ſent for by the ſick. But at bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
this limitation is a fruitleſs remedy, for that when a Monk hath a mind to ſee a ſick
perſon, he will always find perſons enough who will teſtify that he deſired and ſent for
him; and experience hath already made us ſee ſufficiently that theſe witneſſes will never
he wanting; in ſuch ſort, that upon their report, a poor ſick perſon well ſetled in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and that hath no deſign to change it, ſees thoſe perſons enter into his Chamber,
whoſe preſence alone is capable to trouble his Spirit.</p>
               <p>This Article therefore which concerns the ſick, being of ſo ſad and deſtructive conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
and caſting them of the P. R. R. into dangers which they cannot think of with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
uttermoſt conſternation, they do demand with moſt profound Humility, and yet at
the ſame time with the moſt vehement ardour of their Souls, the revocation thereof
whole and entire. To be content with a moderation herein were to no purpoſe, becauſe
there needs no more than the leaſt ſhadow of permiſſion to the Pariſh Prieſts to carry
them beyond all Bounds. Witneſs the Declaration which permits them not to go in to
any ſick without a Judge or an Alderman, or a Conſul. And yet we ſee they go boldly
beyond this Rule, and intrude alone into the houſes of the ſick; and in the ſame manner
the ſimple Prieſts and Monks go without a Magiſtrate, and without calling, becauſe they
have the power in their own hands, and they have nothing to fear whatſoever they
enterprize. The King therefore may be pleaſed to conſider that the yoke which this
Article impoſeth on them of the P. R. R. is unſupportable, and that he may diſcharge
them thereof according to Juſtice, without which it may be ſaid moſt truly, that they
cannot any longer ſubſiſt in the Kingdom, becauſe they have no longer any liberty to
live or dy in repoſe.</p>

into the Hoſpitals in all places, without being conſtrained by violence to

other ſick.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe end of this Article deſtroyes the beginning. For if it be not permitted to them
of the P. R. R. to make Prayers nor Exhortations in the Hoſpitals which may be
heard by others; certainly their ſick can neither be viſited nor comforted, and therefore
cannot remain in the Hoſpitals. For it is well known in what manner the Hoſpitals are
made; every ſick perſon hath not his Chamber apart; there are alwayes many together,
and often two in the ſame bed. It is therefore impoſſible to ſpeak unto one without
being heard of ſome others; and it comes all to one to exclude the P. R. R. from the
Hoſpitals, as to receive them upon an impoſſible condition.</p>
               <p>But over and above this, the Clergy have alſo propoſed another ſcope unto this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle,
which yet every one cannot perceive; ſo going on to ſurprize them who pierce
not into their ſecret intentions, for in cauſing it to be ordained, <hi>that the Catholicks and
thoſe of the P. R. R. ſhould be received indifferently into Hoſpitals in all places;</hi> This is to
hinder them of the ſaid Religion from aſſiſting their poor ſick in their particular houſes,
and to conſtrain them to cauſe them to be carried to their Hoſpitals, where the Prieſts
and Monks will not fail to belabour them, for to cauſe them to change their Religion,
ſo that in conſenting that they may enjoy the Hoſpitals they conſent to nothing at all;
becauſe they add thereunto a condition which takes from them in thoſe places, the means
of being viſited and comforted by their Miniſters. And at the ſame time forbid them
thoſe houſes wherein they may be aſſiſted in their bodies without prejudice to the liberty
of their Conſciences, and conſolation of their Souls. This Article therefore deſerves

of the ſaid Religion or before their Miniſters, in this caſe, if the Defender be
a Catholick, the ſaid Officials ſhall have the Cognizance thereof in like manner;
and if the Defender be of the P. R. R. the Royal Judges ſhall have the Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance
thereof; and by Appeal the Chambers of the Edict.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THis is a rude blow which the Clergy would reach the Edict of <hi>Nantes</hi> in favour
of the Officials of the Biſhops. For the Edict in the 41 Article of the Particulars had
ordained, that the Cognizance of Proceſſes concerning Marriages ſhould appertain to the
Judges Royal; and by Appeal to the Chambers of the Edict, then when both Parties are
of the P. R. R. not attributing the Cognizance to the Officials, but when the one of the
Parties is of the C. A. R. R. And ſo much the more if he be Defendant. But the Article of
the Declaration is contrary hereunto in two manners. For firſt, It wills that the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages
which are made before the Pariſh Prieſts or in the Catholick Churches, ſhould be
judged by the Officials of the Biſhops, though the Defendant be of the P. R. R. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
this Article is couched in ſuch ſort, that even when both the Parties are of the
P. R. R. It gives to underſtand that notwithſtanding, if their Marriages were made in
the Churches of thoſe of the C. A. R. R. or before their Papiſh Prieſts, it ſhould belong
for all that to the Officials to take Cognizance and Judge thereof. Thus here they of the
P. R. R. who are in no ſort at all juſtifiable by the Eccleſiaſticks, are ſubjected unto their
Tribunals: and what may they expect from Judges prejudiced and paſſionate, but rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
condemnations? This Article then takes them of the P. R. R. out of the
hands of the Kings Judges, to put them in the hands of the Officials. This is properly
to repeal the Edict, whoſe ſettlement in this matter is ſo Juſt and ſo Reaſonable, that
the new Commentator who hath imployed all his Spirits to endeavour to take away this
Sacred Buckler of the Edict from them of the P. R. R. hath notwithſtanding ſaid no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at all to elude this 41 Article of the Particulars: on the contrary, he hath elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
confirmed it by the conference of <hi>Fleix</hi> on the 23 Article of the Generals. So
alſo the uſage hath alwayes been hitherto conformable to the Edict. They of the P. R. R.
have hitherto never pleaded in cauſes Matrimonial, but before the Judges Royal and

               <p>THey ſay commonly the end Crowns the Work: but here it deſtroys and ruines it.

according to their form and tenure. But the Clergy having loſt all memory of

doubtleſs, to ſee it cited in this place as conformable to this Declaration. Thus it ſpeaks
in the ſecond Article of the Particulars, which is alledged in this place. <hi>They of the ſaid

               <p>Beſides, it is a thing worthy of conſideration, that not only the Edict hath exempted
thoſe of the P. R. R. from Reparations, re-edifications and buildings, both of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
and Parſonage-houſes; but alſo the Author of the Edict <hi>Henry</hi> the Great, and
<hi>Lewis</hi> the Juſt his Son, both of glorious and immortal memory, have afterwards con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
this exemption throughout, ſo many times as occaſion was preſented, as may be
ſeen in their anſwers to the Papers of 1606. Art. 23, 1623. Art. 19, 1625. Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
4.</p>
               <p>And not only the Edict and the Royal anſwers which are the explications and ſequels
thereof, have eſtabliſhed this right in favour of them of the P. R. R. But alſo it is
certain that the Decrees both of the Council, and Chambers of the Edict have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
conformed thereunto. There are found four decrees of the Council that make
Proofs of this. The firſt is of the fourth of <hi>March</hi> 1602. By which <hi>Francis Boutillon</hi>
and others making profeſſion of the P. R. R. at <hi>Quellebeuf,</hi> were diſcharged of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edification
of the ſaid Church at <hi>Quellebeuf,</hi> and the Catholicks of that place, their Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
were condemned to reſtore unto them that which they had paid, both the Principal
and Coſts. The ſecond was of the one and twentyeth of <hi>Auguſt</hi> following, by which the
Inhabitants of the P. R. R. of <hi>Conde</hi> upon <hi>Noireau</hi> were diſcharged, without regard to
the ſentence of the Baily of that place, of the rate ſet upon them for the re-edification of
the Church and Altar of that Burrow; with a prohibition to the Parſon and the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Inhabitants to rate them for thoſe reparations, on the pain of five hundred Crowns,
and to anſwer in their own proper and private names. The third was of the twenty
eighth of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1623. which diſcharged the Inhabitants of the P. R. R. of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
of <hi>Bearn,</hi> from contributing to the reparation of the Churches and Covents of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks,
as well as the Catholicks from contributing to the building and re-edification of
the Temples of thoſe of the ſaid Religion; making thoſe two things equal and reciprocal;
the which Decree was enregiſtred by the Parliament of <hi>Pau,</hi> the firſt of <hi>July</hi> 1624. And
agreeable to ſo authentick a ſettlement, my Lord the Count of <hi>Gramont,</hi> Governor and
Lievetenant General for the King in his Kingdom of <hi>Navarre,</hi> and in his Country of
<hi>Bearn,</hi> gave forth his Ordinance on the twenty third of <hi>June</hi> 1642. By which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
the Jurats of the place of St. <hi>Suſannne</hi> to be arreſted, and carried to the Priſon
of the Caſtle of <hi>Orther</hi> for having commanded the Inhabitants of the P. R. R. of that
place, to work in the reparation of the Pariſh Church there, and for having ſeized their
Goods upon their Refuſal. The Fourth Decree was of the Counſel of the fourth of
<hi>May</hi> 1650. by which the Inhabitants of the C. A. R. R. of the Pariſh of St. <hi>Thomas</hi>
in the Town of St. <hi>Lo,</hi> were debarred upon their own proper Petition, tending to
cauſe thoſe of the P. R. R. to contribute to the ſum of 5000. Livers, which was to
be raiſed on the Pariſhioners in common for the re-edification of the Church of Saint
<hi>Thomas;</hi> notwithſtanding that the Catholicks alledged that the ſaid Church had been
heretofore demoliſhed by them of the P. R. R. during the Troubles.</p>
               <p>As for the Chambers of the Edict, they have given like Decrees in ſo great number,
that their multitude only hinders from citing them, ſo that this queſtion hath not been
dubious in the Parliament of <hi>Normandy</hi> it ſelf, and the uſage of the <hi>Palais</hi> of that Court
hath been ſo conſtant to diſcharge them of the P. R. R. that they Condemned them alſo to
pay coſts, who had the raſhneſs to aſſail them in this matter of reparations of Churches
and Parſonage-houſes, of which thoſe of the ſaid Religion have the Decrees in readineſs to
juſtifie the truth of their Allegation in caſe there be need. What ſtrang ſurprize then
is this to ſee at this day a practice of Juſtice ſo well eſtabliſhed to be changed all at one
blow, and to repeal a Poſſeſſion founded on the Edict, on the Anſwer-Royal. On the Decrees
of the Council and the Chambers of the Edict, without any one appearing to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
to the time of this Declaration.</p>
               <p>The Preface of this Declaration it ſelf ſetting down—<hi>That what hath been Judged and
decided by the Decrees ſhould be firm for ever, and executed as a Law inviolable.</hi> A Maxim
ſurely, which is one of the greateſt ſurpriſes that the Clergy have made upon the Juſtice
of the King, as hath been ſhewn in the beginning. But notwithſtanding that this Maxim
cannot be received in other things, the exemption granted unto them of the P. R. R.
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:100016:38"/>
in reſpect of the Churches and Parſonage houſes ought to paſs for a Law inviolable,
ſince it hath been judged and decided in all occurrences by the Decrees of the Council
and Chambers of the Edict; Decrees which are ſo much the more indiſputable becauſe
they are founded on the Law, which is the Edict of <hi>Nantes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What can the Eccleſiaſticks then alledge for to colour their pretenſions? All that
they have in their mouths is a vain conſequence which they draw by a falſe reaſoning, and
which ſerves only to ſhew how ill founded they are. They ſay that they of the P. R. R.
do indeed pay Tythes to the Parſons: and by conſequence they ought alſo to contribute
to the Charges of Churches and Parſonage-houſes. But there can be nothing leſs reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.
For there is found in the Edict one expreſs Article which obligeth them of the
ſaid Religion to pay the Tythes. But ſo far it is from having condemned them to
contribute to the repaires of the Churches, and building Parſonage-houſes; that on the
contrary it hath one to exempt them. They cannot then argue rightly from tenths to
reparations. And if one might draw a conſequence from the one to the other, they of the
P. R. R. might as well have good grounds to maintain, that becauſe they are exempt
from Reparations, they ought not to be ſubject unto Tythes: as the other think they have
good ground to maintain, that becauſe thoſe of the ſaid Religion are ſubject to Tythes,
therefore they ought to contribute to reparations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the principal foundation of this affair</hi> is indeed, that they of the P. R. R. were not
made ſubject unto Tythes but by the pure and only authority of <hi>Henry</hi> the Great, who
would have it ſo that he might give that ſatisfaction to the Eccleſiaſticks; for at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,
the Pariſh Prieſts are not the Paſtors of them of the P. R. R. and do them no manner
of ſervice in Spiritual things; they are not bound to entertain them, but only their own
Miniſters who take care of their Souls; which alſo King <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth knew ſo well,
that for to indemnify them in a thing from which their Religion did exempt them; he
was willing to pay them yearly the ſum of 45000. Crowns for the ſubſiſtence of their
Miniſters, to the intent that this ſum might be in the place of the Tythes which they
ought not to have paid. With what appearance of Reaſon then can they draw a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
from Tythes to Reparations; being the payment of Tythes themſelves is a
charge to which they of the P. R. R. were ſo little ſubject, that the King himſelf thought
that it was Juſt for him to Indemnify them in that particular? Would it not be a caſe
very deplorable, that the money being taken away which was expreſly allowed them to
mitigate their payment of Tythes; yet notwithſtanding nevertheleſs, the Tythes ſhould
obtain to oblige them to Reparations? And doth it not ſeem rather to be Juſtice to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore
their Penſion of 45000 Crowns for to recompenſe the Tythes which they pay in
conſideration of that ſum, than to will that they be charged with new payments for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations,
from which they are exempt by all manner of Reaſon?</p>
               <p>It were in vain to pretend to make that limitation valid, which is found in the end of
this Article, where it is ſaid, <hi>that they may not be Cottized, rated by the Poll,</hi> i.e. that
they may not be obliged to contribute, with reſpect to their Perſons; but only accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the proportion of their Lands and Inheritances which they poſſeſs in their Pariſhes,
ſo that they who have neither houſes nor Lands ſhould pay nothing. This is a very ſad
conſolation, which regards only thoſe miſerable perſons that have neither houſe nor
home. And which is more, this ſort of rating is not ordinarily ſet, ſave only on Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritances,
ſo that to allow this exemption only to thoſe that have no eſtate in Lands, is
to allow nothing in effect. The Edict it ſelf will not ſuffer a thought of this fruitleſs
exemption. For can it be ſaid that when the Edict of <hi>Nantes</hi> exempts them of the
P. R. R. from contributing to the Reparation of Churches and Parſonage-houſes, that
its intention was only to diſcharge Perſons and not Lands? There is no appearance that
any perſon would propoſe a thing ſo unreaſonable. For the Decrees of the Council and
of the Chambers of the Edict alledged above do fully evince the contrary, by authentick
deciſions which have been made in this matter during the term of more than threeſcor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
years; alwayes diſcharging thoſe of the P. R. R. which poſſeſſed Lands purely
and wholly of theſe Eccleſiaſtick Reparations. Being then the Edict exempts the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances
as well as the Perſons; it follows clearly that this new Declaration in pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
that they of the ſaid Religion ſhould not be rated in regard of their heads, makes
nothing at all for them, and that it cannot be otherwiſe looked on than as the ruine of
the Article of the Edict. A ruine which infallibly draws after it that of his Majeſties Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
who profeſs the P. R. R. For this will be a ſure means for the Eccleſiaſticks to ſpoil
them of their Eſtates: becauſe that out of hate to their Religion, the Parſons, Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurers
and Guardians of Pariſhes will make them bear almoſt all the Charges of theſe
Reparations; as is ſeen of late by experience. They invent even every day a thouſand
crafty ſhifts, for to charge all the load of expences on them, and to diſcharge thoſe of
the C. A. R. R. And it will quickly be found, if there be no remedy, that all the mony
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:100016:38"/>
which ſhould be paid to the King, or imployed to the publick weal, will go to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edification
of Churches, and building of Parſonage-houſes, or trimming up of Altars.
This Article then is one of them, the revocation whereof is of moſt importance, and his
Majeſty ſhall do a thing worthy his Juſtice and his Royal bounty to condeſcend thereto,
and to evacuate the Decrees and Judgements that have been given in conſequence thereof.</p>
               <p>Thus they of the P. R. R. juſtify what they have undertaken; maintaining that this
whole Declaration of the ſecond of <hi>April</hi> 1666. is compoſed of nothing elſe but
Articles either frivolous which deſerve not to have any place therein, or contrary to
the Edict of <hi>Nantes,</hi> and by conſequence worthy to be rejected, as contrary to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
intention, who would that this perpetual and irrevocable Edict be exactly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
in his Dominion. This great Monarch who by God's example, whoſe living Image
he is, hath no reſpect unto the appearance of mens perſons, and who heares the leaſt
of his People as well as the greateſt of his Realm, is beſought to give to theſe obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
ſome moments of that equitable attention which he allows to all thoſe who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore
his Juſtice: to the end, that knowing how reaſonable the complaints of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of the P. R. R. are, he may revoke a Declaration which is the Tomb of the Edict,
the work of the Hate and Animoſity of the Clergy, the Ruine of the Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,

            <head>THE
SECOND
DECLARATION
OF
The ſame Second day of April, 1666. Entituled
AGAINST THE
RELAPSED
AND
BLASPHEMERS.</head>
            <p>LEWIS, By the Grace of God, King of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Navarr,</hi> To all thoſe to whom
theſe Preſents ſhall come, Greeting. Since it hath pleaſed God to give Peace unto
Our Realm, We have applyed Our Cares to Reform the Diſorders which the licence of
the War hath introduced; and becauſe the Violations of the Edicts of the Pacificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
were the moſt conſiderable, We have laboured to repair them exactly by Commiſſioners, as
well Catholicks as of the P. R. R. whom We have ſent for this purpoſe into Our Provinces, by
whoſe Report We having underſtood that one of the greateſt evils, and againſt which it was neceſſary
to make ſome Proviſion, concerned the abuſe which hath been introduced of late time, by which,
many who profeſſed the P. R. R. did abjure it to embrace the Catholick, and after they had
participated of the moſt holy Myſteries, returned by a ſcandalous contempt and Sacriledge to their
firſt Hereſie. As alſo, that thoſe who were engaged in holy Orders, whereunto they were obliged
by Vows, quitted their Order, and forſook their Monaſtery, to profeſs the P. R. R. againſt
which We believed We had ſufficiently provided by Our Declaration of the Month of <hi>April</hi> 1663.
having prohibited Our Subjects of the P. R. R. who had once made Abjuration thereof, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
the Catholick Religion, and thoſe who were engaged in the holy Orders of the Church, and
to the Religious Men and Women, to quitt the Catholick Religion, to take up the P. R. R. upon
any pretext whatſoever. But becauſe theſe Prohibitions without any Penalty, have not produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the effect which We did promiſe our ſelves, We were obliged to give out a ſecond Declaration
of the twentieth of <hi>June,</hi> the laſt Year, 1665. By which We Ordained that the Relapſed and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates,
ſhould be puniſhed by the Penalty of Baniſhment; which Declarations have alſo continued with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
effect, becauſe thoſe who were guilty of theſe Crimes, betook themſelves unto the Chambers of the
Edict, notwithſtanding the Cognizance of that Fact was appropriated by the ſaid Declaration,
to Our Parliaments, to whom for this purpoſe We had addreſſed them, and that under pretext
that We had not preciſely forbidden the Cogniſance thereof unto the ſaid Chambers, to whom
the Juriſdiction thereof could not pertain, Our Edicts being not made in favour of them who were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict
of ſuch Crimes, no more than of Blaſphemies and Impieties uttered againſt the Myſteries of the
Catholick Religion. Know therefore, that for theſe cauſes and other good conſiderations thereunto
moving <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s; By the Advice of Our Council, and of Our certain Knowledge, full Power and Royal
Authority, We have ſaid and declared, and do by theſe Preſents, Signed with our hand, ſay and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:100016:39"/>
declare; We Will, and it is Our pleaſure, that according to Our ſaid Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
all who are guilty and accuſed of the Crime of Relapſe or Apoſtacy, ſhall be
judged by the Parliaments every one in his Precinct, and the Proceſs by them made and perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
according to the Declaration of <hi>June</hi> 22, 1665. as alſo in like manner, they who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed
of Blaſphemy and Impieties uttered againſt the myſteries of the Catholick Religion, with
Prohibition to the Chambers of the Edict to take Cognizance thereof directly or indirectly, under
any pretext or occaſion whatſoever, under pain of nullity, and evacuation of the Proceedings, Coſts,
Damages, and Intereſts of the Parties, and greater, if need be; which our Attorneys of
the ſaid Chambers ſhall take notice of, upon pain of anſwering therefore: giving Commandment to
our beloved and leige Counſellors holding Our Courts of Parliament, Baylifs, Stewards, and all
other Our Officers and Juſtices to whom it appertains, that they cauſe theſe preſents to be Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred
purely and ſimply; and the contents thereof to be executed, kept and obſerved according to
the form and tenure thereof; For ſuch is Our pleaſure. In witneſs whereof We have cauſed Our
Seal to be put unto theſe Preſents, to the Copies whereof credit is to be given as to the Original,
Given at St. <hi>Germains</hi> in <hi>Laye</hi> the ſecond day of <hi>April,</hi> in the Year of Grace, 1666. And

            <div type="observations">
               <head>Obſervations upon this Second Declaration.</head>
               <p>AS this ſecond Declaration is brought forth in the ſame place and on the ſame day
with the former, ſo is it conceived by the ſame Spirit. For the Clergy who ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted
the former, are alſo the Authors of this, and the Character of the Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks
appears ſo viſible therein, that one cannot read it without perceiving immediately
that it is their work, and that the Sacred name of his Majeſty was not ſet to it without
a moſt evident ſurprize..</p>
               <p>The Style alone of this Ordinance ſhews ſufficiently from whom it doth proceed, we
need only conſider the terms it makes uſe of, to avouch that it is not the King that
ſpeaks therein. For the P. R. R. is therein called Hereſie; they that have quitted it,
and return thereto, are named Relapſed: The Prieſts and Monks which embrace it,
Apoſtates and Sacrilegious; and thoſe that ſpeak at all as they think of matters in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie,
are qualified as Blaſphemers againſt the myſteries of the Catholick Religion.</p>
               <p>All <hi>France</hi> knows that ſince the Edicts of Pacification, our Kings have never expreſſed
themſelves in this manner, and there is not found any Declaration, Decree or publick
Act, that have uſed theſe injurious terms. On the contrary, the Edict of <hi>Nantes</hi> in its
ſecond Article hath forbidden all thoſe of the one and other Religion <hi>to outrage or offend
one another in Word or Deed, enjoyning them to contain themſelves and to live peaceably together
as Brethren, Friends, and fellow-Citizens, upon pain upon the Tranſgreſſors to be puniſhed as infrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
of the Peace and diſturbers of the publick Repoſe,</hi> which was no other than a renovation
of the Ordinance made in the Year 1570, by <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth, Confirmed by <hi>Henry</hi>
the third in his Edicts of 1576, and 1577. and found ſo Juſt and Neceſſary by
<hi>Lewis</hi> the thirteenth Father of his Majeſty, that he would expreſly re-iterate the ſame
in his Declaration given at <hi>Blois,</hi> in the Year 1616. How is it poſſible to cauſe this
prohibition to be executed, and to hinder them of the Catholick Apoſtolick Religion
from outraging in Word and in Deed theſe of the P. R. R. if the Declarations them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
which bear the Kings name, treat the Religion and Belief of the latter as Hereſie?
For is it not to Authorize the other to call them Hereticks; a term which without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
is an injury of all other moſt outragious, and moſt capable to wound the
hearts and provoke the Spirits of men: and ſo far off is this odious name from conſiſting
with the deſign of their living together as Friends and Brethren, that it is certain that
it is capable to make Brethren and themſelves irreconcilable enemies.</p>
               <p>The Wiſdom and Juſtice of our Kings have cauſed them to condemn formally this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious
name of Hereticks, and ſometimes to imploy the Authority of their Ordinances
to baniſh it from the Writings and Language of their Subjects, in reſpect of them who
profeſs the P. R. R. This may be ſeen by the anſwer of <hi>Henry</hi> the Great to the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
Article of the Paper preſented unto him in 1602. by thoſe of the P. R. R. who
complained that contrary unto the tenure of the ſeventeenth Article of the Edict <hi>many
Preachers, and the Advocates of the Parliaments of</hi> Tholouſe, Bordeox, Province <hi>and</hi> Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
<hi>and other Benches of their Precincts did licence themſelves to hold ſcandalous diſcourſes, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
them of the ſaid Religion Hereticks,</hi> whereupon it was enjoyned the Attorneys General
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:100016:40"/>
and their Subſtitutes thereof to inform <hi>ex officio</hi> on pain to anſwer it in their own proper
private names. It may be ſeen alſo by the anſwer of the ſame King to the ſixth Article
of the Paper of 1604. For they of the ſaid Religion having conceived that in the great
Church of <hi>Bazas,</hi> there was left an inſcription made, during the troubles, in which
were theſe words, <hi>ab Hereticis Huguenotis;</hi> It was ſaid that a <hi>Commiſſion ſhould be given
out to the Steward of</hi> Bazas <hi>for to cauſe them to be put out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Above all, the anſwer of <hi>Lewis</hi> the Juſt to the third Article of the Paper of 1615.
reviewed and ratified by that of the third and ſixth of <hi>May</hi> 1616. is extreamly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable.
For they of the P. R. R. who ſaw that the Clergy would ſerve themſelves of
the Oath which the King made at his Coronation <hi>to extirpate Hereſies</hi> to animate him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their ruine, demanded that it would pleaſe his Majeſty to declare that this Oath did
not reſpect them at all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor imported any prejudice to the liberty of the Edicts of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cification
made in favour unto them; it was anſwered in theſe terms, <hi>The King hath not
intended in the Oath which he took at his Coronation to comprehend thoſe of the P. R. R. living
in this Realm, under the benefit of his Edicts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Is it not then a thing wonderful ſtrange that againſt the ſettlement of ſo many Edicts;
againſt the Declarations of four Kings, and particularly thoſe two great Princes, the
Grand-Father and Father of his Majeſty; againſt the uſage of ſo many Years, and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent
of a whole Age, the Eccleſiaſticks have enterprized to give the P. R. R. the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faming
Title of Hereſie, and to cauſe them who make profeſſion of this Doctrine to
paſs for Hereticks in a Royal Declaration?</p>
               <p>They have done it without doubt to make themſelves a Diſpenſation from the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the ſeventeenth Article of the Edict, which <hi>forbids all Readers, Preachers and others
who ſpeak in publick, to uſe any words, talk, or diſcourſes tending to ſtir up the People to Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
enjoyning them to contain and comport themſelves modeſtly, and to ſay nothing but what
might tend to maintain the Repoſe and Tranquility eſtabliſhed within the Kingdom.</hi> For having
by ſurprize cauſed the Kings Declarations to talke after their manner, what will they
not allow themſelves in their Chaires? What Licence will they not inſpire into their
Auditors? What averſation and hate will they not draw upon thoſe whoſe Peace the
Edict did intend to procure? Since after this their Countrymen conſidering them under
the Maſque of Hereſie, will look on them no longer but with horror; and the example
of the Parliament of <hi>Bretaigne,</hi> teſtifies very well how far this impreſſion may carry men.
For amongſt the Parliaments of <hi>France</hi> this is one of the moſt eager againſt them of
the P. R. R. and the Condemnation of <hi>Mounſeiur de la Touche</hi> whom they cauſed to be taken
and burnt with cruel Torments for a Crime whereof he never had a thought, and of
which the Providence of God was pleaſed to juſtifie him after his death in an admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
manner, is but too ſad a proof; and others no leſs convincing may be alſo alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.
Theſe tranſports are the Conſequents of the Licence which this Parliament hath
alwayes given it ſelf to treat them of this Religion as Heretick, of which it hath taken
ſo ſtrong a habit, that it condemned the laſt year by a Decree, the Bayliffs deputy of the
Town of <hi>Vitre</hi> in 21 Livers Fine, for having ordained joyntly with other two Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Judges that the term of <hi>Hereſie</hi> imployed in the Writs of a Conplainant ſhould
be raſed out. They of the ſaid Religion complain unto his Majeſty of this unjuſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree,
and humbly demand of him the revocation of it; and they alſo at the ſame time
do beſeech him to prohibit the Eccleſiaſticks and all others, and particularly the writer
of the Gazets, whoſe writings are the more dangerous, becauſe they paſs into all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Europe, to blaſt them by the name of Hereticks, being it cannot but tend to
cauſe Sedition in the Eſtate, and to make Union and Concord amongſt his Majeſties Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
to become impoſſible.</p>
               <p>But though the Stile of this Declaration in which it delivers it ſelf be ſtrange, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
the ſettlements which it contains are no leſs, and the Paſſion of the Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks
is here manifeſted without any converture. For herein they ſpeak of three ſorts
of Perſons, of the Relapſed, Apoſtates, and Blaſphemers of the Myſteries of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Religion. The two firſt are condemned to be Baniſhed out of the Kingdom;
and the Cognizance of the Proceſs to be made againſt all the three, is taken abſolutely
from the Chambers of the Edicts, and attributed intirely to the Parliaments. So it is,
that the Clergy thruſt forward and advance alwayes their enterprizes againſt them of
the P. R. R. to throw them at laſt, if they can, into deſpair. For in the Month of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril,</hi>
1663. they have gotten a Declaration by ſurprize, againſt thoſe whom they call
Relapſed and Apoſtates. But that ſaid nothing at all of thoſe others whom they
call Blaſphemers againſt the Myſteries of the Catholick Religion. Afterwards in the
Month of <hi>June</hi> 1665. The Clergy ſuggeſted another Declaration to expreſs and fix the
Penalty which they would impoſe upon theſe pretended Relapſed and Apoſtates, cauſing
them to be condemned unto perpetual Baniſhment. But the Chambers of the Edict

were not forbidden to take Cognizance thereof. In the end the Animoſity of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
being not yet ſatisfied, and fearing they had not yet got force enough to Baniſh
thoſe out of the Realm whoſe abode in <hi>France</hi> is to them inſupportable; they would
give them the laſt blow in 1666. Procuring this Declaration, which leaves
them no means who ſhall be accuſed for Relapſed or Apoſtates, or Blaſphemers againſt
the Catholick Religion, to bring themſelves before the Chambers of the Edict, to the end
they may find no ſhelter any where againſt the ardour of the purſuit of their Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
               <p>It is eaſie to ſhew that in all theſe Heads the King is impoſed on, and that they have
ſurprized him in his Religion and Equity.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Of the Relapſed.</head>
               <p>As for the Relapſed, the Eccleſiaſticks have given his Majeſty to underſtand, as it
appears by the firſt Declaration of the Month of <hi>April</hi> 1663. That he ſhould not ſuffer
the profanation and impiety of thoſe <hi>who for the conſiderations of Marriages and other like
Motives, after they had made Abjuration of the P. R. R. and profeſſion of the Catholick Religion
turned to their firſt error.</hi> And certainly it is true that thoſe who out of an impious and
profane ſpirit, Sport themſelves ſo with the Myſteries of R. or that ſeek only to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the World with a diſſembled profeſſion and for intereſts meerly humane, are infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
condemnible and deſerve to be puniſhed exemplarily. But under this pretence,
the Clergy, by a viſible artifice have cauſed a general Law to be made againſt thoſe who
would return unto the profeſſion of their firſt belief, whatſoever their motive be, and
although their return be altogether diſintereſſed, and though they have no other end
of their change than the repoſe of their Conſciences.</p>
               <p>In this the ſurprize appears manifeſtly. For, is it credible that the King would
force by the ſeverity of his Ordinances and by rigorous penalties, a perſon wounded in
his Soul, to ſtay againſt its reſentments in a Religion which it eſteems not good, and
wherein it hath no hope to be ſaved? If a man through infirmity, or ignorance, or by
ſome temptation which dazles his Spirit and ſurprizes his heart, ſuffers himſelf to be
tranſported to quit his Religion, and afterwards a ſerious reflection, or more ample in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
give him apprehenſions, and perſwade him that he cannot be ſaved but by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entring
into the Church from which he was departed; is it poſſible that any ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
either to conſtrain or puniſh him whilſt he acts by this Principle, and hath no other
motive but the diſcharge and duty of his Conſcience?</p>
               <p>His Majeſty knows that of all things in the World, Conſcience is moſt free, and that
the authority of thoſe Soveraigns whoſe Yoak is born by the whole earth, pretend not
to have a right to conſtrain it. If St. <hi>Bernard</hi> had not ſaid it in his time, <hi>That Faith is
to be perſwaded and not to be commanded, (fides ſuadenda eſt non imperanda.</hi>) Reaſon it ſelf
hath ſpoken it enough; and the example of the King of Kings affords us thereof a
good proof. For this adorable maſter to whom the whole World oweth obedience,
hath never imployed the Terror of his Thunder, nor the greatneſs of his Authority
to oblige men to believe his Goſpel. He hath not uſed in this his deſign any thing but
the truth of his Myſteries and the Preaching of his Apoſtles. <hi>Faith</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom.
10. 17.) <hi>is by hearing, and hearing by the word of God,</hi> he ſaith not that Faith is by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Declarations, nor of Decrees, nor of Menaces, but of that Divine Word whoſe
perſwaſion alone is capable to beget it in mens Spirits.</p>
               <p>How then would they put on the King to enforce man by the terror of his Baniſhments
to continue in that Religion which he approves not? For what can come of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint?
But only that he ſhould be inwardly of one Religion; and outwardly of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
that is to ſay, that he ſhould be an Hypocrite, Sacrilegious, and impious who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes
two Religions at once; who doth violate the one by the thoughts of his heart,
and the other by the words of his mouth, and actions of his body. Or to ſpeak more
truly, he will be a man without Religion. For he that ſerves himſelf of two Religions
at once hath none at all, and differs very little from an Atheiſt. The King himſelf can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
have confidence in him, nor be aſſured of his Fidelity. For how ſhall one believe
that his obedience was ſincere towards his Prince, whilſt it is diſſembled towards
God?</p>
               <p>Finally, the Edict of <hi>Nantes</hi> needs only to be conſidered, for to avouch that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
intituled againſt the Relapſed, can be nothing elſe than a ſurprize. For it is
manifeſt that that Edict gives an entire Liberty of Conſcience without exception to them
of the P. R. R. without diſtinguiſhing of thoſe that are born in it, and thoſe that come
over to it, betwixt them that have alwayes followed it, and thoſe that return after they
have quitted it for ſome time.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:100016:41"/>
                  <hi>The ſixth Article of the Generals expreſſeth it ſelf in theſe Terms,</hi> That we may
not leave any occaſion of troubles and differences amongſt our Subjects, We have permitted and
do permit them of the ſaid P. R. R. to abide in all the Towns and Places of this our Realm
and the Countries under our Obedience, without being inquired after, vexed, moleſted, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
to do any thing in the matters of Religion againſt their Conſcience, nor by reaſon thereof
to be ſought out in their houſes and places where they are pleaſed to dwell. <hi>According to this
Article then all thoſe that are of this Religion of what ſort ſoever they be, may dwell
ſafely and peaceably in their houſes; and the Declaration on the contrary Baniſheth
them from all places of the whole Realm, one part of them of that Religion,</hi> i. e. <hi>thoſe
who return thereto after ſome ſlight change.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt Article of the Particulars is alſo more conſiderable and more expreſs.
For it gives ſuch an extent to this liberty of Conſcience, that no perſon is
therefrom excluded, making uſe of theſe words, <hi>The ſixth Article of the ſaid Edict,
touching liberty of Conſcience, and permiſſion to all his Majeſties Subjects to live and abide in this
Realm, ſhall take place and be obſerved according to its form and tenure, as well for Miniſters
and Schoolmaſters, as for all others who are, or ſhall be of the ſaid R. whether they be Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of this Kingdom, or others.</hi> It cannot be doubted, that this Settlement doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
thoſe whom they call Relapſed, ſince it ſpeaks not only thoſe which <hi>are,</hi> but thoſe
alſo which <hi>ſhall be</hi> of the P. R. R. authorizing alſo thoſe perſons that may return there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
hereafter, as well as thoſe who have not departed from it at all.</p>
               <p>This hath been ſo conſtant from the time of the Edict, that the Edict it ſelf wills,
that this Liberty of Conſcience ſhould be extended unto thoſe who before were return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the P. R. R, and that it hath in it one Article to hinder all inquiry after them,
notwithſtanding any ſecurity that they might have given for aſſurance of the contrary.
This is in the ninth Article, which imports, <hi>That thoſe of the P. R. R. ſhould not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ways conſtrained, nor continue obliged, by reaſon of any abjurations, promiſes, or Oaths which
they have made heretofore, or ſecurities that they had given, concerning any matter of
Religion, and that they might not be moleſted or troubled therefore in any ſort whatſoever.</hi> It
is therefore without all reaſon that any one ſhould make uſe of this Article againſt them,
who after the Edict, re-aſſume the Religion which they had abjured, as if the intention
of the Law-giver had reſpected that only which was paſt. For before the Edict, the
Liberty of Conſcience not well eſtabliſhed throughout the Realm, and the Records be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
full of Decrees, of Arreſts againſt the Bodies, and other rigorous ſentences againſt
thoſe, who notwithſtanding their abjurations and ſecurities had changed once more, it
was therefore neceſſary to provide for that. But by the Edict this liberty being ſo
plainly and generally granted to all people, as is ſeen by the Articles already rehearſed;
the thing was not afterwards any more in queſtion, and there were no more Sureties to
be taken of thoſe who after their abjuration ſhould change in the future, for that they
were compriſed in the common liberty of all perſons within the Realm.</p>
               <p>It is not poſſible to have any doubt of this matter, when it is conſidered, that until
the Declaration 1663, there was never any inquiry nor purſuit made againſt thoſe who
returned in this manner. An indubitable proof that they were within the terms of the
benefit of the Edict. Otherwiſe we muſt accuſe all the Attourney-Generals, and all
their Subſtitutes to have been ignorant of their duty, or not to have executed their
Office for ſo long a ſpace of time. And how come the Eccleſiaſticks that are ſo active,
and ſo vigilant againſt thoſe who depart from their Communion to enter into another
which they hate, to have ſlept ſo many years without enterpriſing to diſquiet them
by Juſtice? That Decree it ſelf given by the Council of Eſtate, <hi>September</hi> 18, 1664,
to declare that the Ordinance of the King againſt the Relapſed, might have no effect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troactive
againſt them who before were returned from the P. R. R. is an evident te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony,
that this is a new Law contrary to the intention of the Edict, that ſince the
Edict until then there had been no purſuit made againſt theſe perſons, and that they
had not pretended only ſo much as to have right to do. For he that hath acted againſt the
Law, is a debtor to the Law. Being then they have let paſs ſixty five years, without
demanding any thing againſt the pretended Relapſed, it is concluded that they were
not Debtors, and that they had not tranſgreſſed the Edict; <hi>Satis eſt argumenti nihil eſſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitum
Naevio, quod tam diu nihil petivit. Orat. pro Quinctio. It is argument enough that there
is nothing due unto</hi> Naevius, <hi>becauſe of ſo long time he hath demanded nothing.</hi> As the Roman
Orator ſpeaks.</p>

               <p>The ſame reaſons which have been alledged for thoſe whom they named Relapſed,
ſerve equally for thoſe whom they qualifie as Apoſtates. For the liberty of Conſcience
is acquired by the Edict to all ſorts of perſons, whether Eccleſiaſticks, or Laicks.
Where the queſtion was of regulating the Intereſts of the Eccleſiaſticks, who before
the Edict changed their Religion, there was nothing at all touched concerning their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence,
or abode within the Realm, becauſe that was preſuppoſed as certain and aſſured,
by the Liberty of Conſcience given univerſally unto all; but proviſion was only made for
their Marriages to declare them good and valid; and the ſucceſſion to their Moveables,
Purchaſes and Acquiſitions were confirmed to their Children by the thirty ninth Article
of the Particulars. Is it poſſible that the condition of theſe Perſons is made worſe by
the Edict which is the foundation of the publick Liberty? This is a thing not concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable;
and notwithſtanding that would come to paſs, if the Marriages of the Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtick
and Religious Perſons which were before the Edict, being authorized; it were
not permitted to others who would imitate them at this day, to live only in <hi>France,</hi>
and to continue in the poſſeſſion of their Goods.</p>
               <p>This were to bring them back to be under the Yoak of the Edict of <hi>Charles</hi> the Ninth,
That Edict which was made in 1563. in the midſt of the height of the Wars, and in
the greateſt averſation of Spirits. For in the twelfth Article it is ordained, that <hi>the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
Religious Men and Women who had liberty given them to depart</hi> (out of their Monaſteries)
<hi>during, and ſince the Troubles, ſhould return to their Monaſteries, to live there according to the
Conſtitutions of the C. A. R. C. Otherwiſe they ſhould be obliged to depart the Kingdom.</hi> Its known
that this Edict and all thoſe that followed were abrogated by that of <hi>Nantes,</hi> in the ninety
firſt Article; ſo that this were to bring back the ſettlement of the Edict 1663. and to
evacuate that of <hi>Nantes</hi> which had annulled the other.</p>
               <p>The Eccleſiaſticks themſelves ought to hinder them of their Orders from being thus
handled, by the Maxim which they teach, That the intention of the Prieſt is neceſſary
to the Sacraments. For what intention can they have who are retained by conſtraint in
a Religion which they believe not to be Orthodox? For this cauſe it is to be hoped that
his Majeſty ſeeing things by Lights much clearer than thoſe of paſſionate Perſons, will
re-eſtabliſh that Liberty which they inforce themſelves to very ill purpoſe to deſtroy, and
that he will find that it will not be juſt to condemn unto Baniſhment the Eccleſiaſticks
who would embrace the P. R. R. Being they recompence the Miniſters who abandon it
and allow them Priviledges, and aſſign them yearly Penſions.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>Of Blaſphemers of the Myſteries of the Catholick Religion.</head>
               <p>We cannot promiſe our ſelves leſs Juſtice towards thoſe whom they would have to paſs
for Blaſphemers againſt the Myſteries of the Catholick Religion. This is a point of the
higheſt importance, and which throws them of the P. R. R. into mortal Allarms. For
by theſe Myſteries of the Catholick Religion, they mean without doubt the Doctrines
and Ceremonies with which they of another Communion do not accord. So that all the
Sermons of their Miniſters, all their Books of Controverſie, all private Diſcourſes of
theſe diſputed matters, ſhall hereafter be treated as Blaſphemies and Impieties. So that
they may never hereafter pretend neither to ſpeak of theſe things in their Chaires, nor
to write thereof in their Books, nor to conſerr about them upon the moſt juſt and ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitable
occaſions. There muſt therefore be no more Liberty for them in the Kingdom.
There can be no more for them any ſort of Security. They muſt of neceſſity
either be Cowardly or Prevaricators, in not daring to ſpeak of their Faith; or miſerable, in
expoſing their Lives at every word which they ſhall dare to pronounce in maintainance of
their Belief. To eſtabliſh this rigour were infallibly to baniſh them all out of the State,
which is a rigour impoſſible to be reconciled with his Majeſties intention. For being in
<hi>France,</hi> the Liberty is left them of the P. R. R. to believe and to profeſs their Doctrine,
it follows of neceſſity that that of ſpeaking alſo be allowed unto them. The Language of
the Mouth ought to be conformable to the apprehenſions of the heart, and the profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of any Doctrine cannot be otherwiſe made than by words, which are thereof the
natural image and portraiture.</p>
               <p>This is the Reaſon alſo why the Clergy knowing well that the pretended Crime of
a Blaſphemer againſt the Myſteries of the Catholick Religion, even as thoſe of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſed
and Apoſtates, were no other than ſuppoſed Crimes; they believed that to attain
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:100016:42"/>
to their deſign, of cauſing them to be puniſhed, it was neceſſary to take away the Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance
thereof from the Judges who are obliged to keep cloſe to the Edict, and who
knew how they of the P. R. R. ought to live and ought to ſpeak; upon this account
they have cauſed the Chambers of the Edict to be prohibited to Judge in theſe matters,
that they might attribute it only unto Parliaments, and to the great Chambers, as the
Declaration imports, of which complaint is now made.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>Of the Prohibition made to the Chambers of the Edict, to take Cognizance of

Catholick Religion.</head>
               <p>Of all complaints which can be made by them of the P. R. R. there is not any that
can give them more fear and more diſquiet than this, and therefore they caſt themſelves
in this matter, at his Majeſties feet, beſeeching him with extreme conſternation that he
would have pitty on them. For to ſend theſe back unto the Parliaments, of whom this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
ſpeaks, is an aſſured means, not only to deſtroy them, but to deſtroy all thoſe
of that Religion; for hereafter to deſtroy a perſon of that Profeſſion, it will need only
to impute unto him that he hath held ſome diſcourſe againſt the Myſteries of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Religion, to the end that he may be brought before the great Chambers, whereof
the greateſt part of the Judges are ſo animated, that it ſufficeth with them to be
of the P. R. R. to make him Criminal and puniſhable in their Spirits. They will min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
alſo this ingredient even in all the cauſes of them of the ſaid Religion, ſo that there
ſhall not be any more any Chambers of the Edict for them, and all their affairs ſhall be
brought before the Parliaments. This is to repeal the great deſign of the Edict, and to
give them of the P. R. R. cauſe to fear that they ſhall not be ſuffered any longer in <hi>France.</hi>
For that they might enjoy any repoſe, the Edict of <hi>Nantes</hi> judged it neceſſary to take
them out of the hands of the Parliaments, and to allow them particular Chambers, where
<hi>Juſtice might be done them without ſuſpition or hatred,</hi> as the thirtieth Article of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals
doth ſpeak.</p>
               <p>How great then hath the ſurprize of the Clergy been in this point? and of what
reaſon can they ſerve themſelves to cauſe the Chambers of the Edict to be prohibited to
judge of thoſe whom they name Relapſed, Apoſtates, and Blaſphemers? For being
they have given unto theſe people ſuch names as they pleaſed; and conceived an action
againſt them under the Idea of the greateſt Crimes, therefore the rather according to the
Edict, ought the Chambers ordained for them of the P. R. R. take Cognizance thereof,
with excluſion of the Parliaments. For the thirty fourth Article of the Generals im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports,
<hi>That the ſaid Chambers ſhould take Cognizance, and judge Soveraignly and with final de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
by Decree, privatively to all others, the Proceſs and Differences moved and which
ſhall be moved, in which they of the ſaid Religion were Parties, Principal, or Security, Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifs
or Defendants in all matters Civil or Criminal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fifty ſecond Article in confirming this Settlement, addes thereunto a clauſe deciſive
in theſe terms, <hi>The Article of the Juriſdiction of theſe Chambers ordained by this preſent Edict,
ſhall be followed and obſerved according to the form and tenure even in what concerns the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and not execution or violation of our Edicts, when they of the ſaid Religion ſhall be Parties.</hi>
From this an invincible Argument may be drawn; for the action of them whom they call
Relapſed, Apoſtates and Blaſphemers, is either a violation of the Edict or not: If it be
not, then is it not to be inquired after, nor condemned, nor puniſhed. If it be, it
ought then to be ſent back to the Chambers of the Edict, to whom alone, as competent
Judges belongs the Juriſdiction of the inexecution or violation of the Edicts.</p>
               <p>One may ſay, that the Law-giver foreſeeing theſe very aſſaults which the Clergy would
one day make againſt the Juriſdiction of theſe Chambers, he hath been deſirous to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
them by all means poſſible. For not content with the two Articles which have
been already repreſented, he hath made another alſo, which is as it were the laſt Seal
of his will: <hi>Inhibiting,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and forbidding all our Soveraign Courts and others of our
Realm, to take Cognizance of, or Judge Proceſs Civiles or Criminals of thoſe of the ſaid Religion,
whoſe Cognizance is by our Edict attributed to the ſaid Chambers, provided that the reference there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
be by them demanded.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Art. 64. <hi>Can there be now a contrariety more formal than that of this Article and
the Declaration? That prohibits all the Soveraign Courts of the Realm to take Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance
or to Judge of the Criminal Proceſs of them of the P. R. R. And this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
reverſing it, wills that</hi> all guilty and accuſed af the Crime of Relapſe, Apoſtaſie, or
Blaſphemies uttered againſt the Myſteries of the Catholick Religion, ſhall be judged by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:100016:42"/>
every one in his Precinct; with Prohibition to the Chambers of the Edict to take Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance
thereof directly or indirectly, under what pretext or occaſion ſoever, upon pain of nullity,
evacuation of proceedings, Expenſes, Charges, Damages and Intereſts of the Parties, <hi>and</hi> great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
if need require.</p>
               <p>The Eccleſiaſticks then can never attempt any thing more highly againſt the Edict,
then in ſuggeſting this Declaration; and it is clear that they had not purſued thus far,
but to the end their Prey might not eſcape them, becauſe the animoſity of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
is ſo great againſt them of the P. R. R. that they are infallibly loſt, if they be
left in their power. There have been infinite vexatious experiences had of this; and
that we may not paſs from the matter that is here in queſtion, a Decree was made by
the Parliament of <hi>Tolouſe, Feb.</hi> 23, 1665. againſt one named <hi>John Gayrard,</hi> who had
forſaken his Religion, and was returned on the ſecond of <hi>April,</hi> 1662. a year before
the firſt Declaration againſt the pretended Relapſed. Notwithſtanding by this Decree,
he was condemned <hi>to be delivered into the hands of the Executioner of the Haut Juſtice to be
led with a Halter ahout his Neck, in his Shirt, his Head and Feet bare, on a Lords day before
the Cathedral Church of</hi> Montauban, <hi>at the cloſe of the great Maſs; where being on his
knees, he ſhould ask Pardon of God, the King, and Juſtice for his miſdeeds, be baniſhed the
Town and Shrievalty of</hi> Montauban, <hi>for three years, and condemned in a hundred Livers for a
Fine, and in the Charges, and ſent back to the Conſuls of</hi> Montauban <hi>to cauſe this Decree to
be put in Execution.</hi> In purſuit whereof, having been re-cloſed three Months in the
Priſons of <hi>Tolouſe,</hi> he was led to that of <hi>Montauban,</hi> where he hath been ever ſince, and
there he is at preſent. So it comes to paſs that this Parliament gives it ſelf all licenſe,
not only to ſurpaſs the rigour of the Declarations, in turning one part of his Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
into a reparation much more infamous and inſupportable; but which is more,
they have condemned a man, who according to the Decree of the Council of Eſtate, of
the 18th of <hi>September,</hi> 1664. ought to have been abſolved and diſcharged of all penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
becauſe he was re-entred into his Religion a Year before the firſt of the Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
by which they would prevail againſt him.</p>
               <p>But we need not be ſurpriſed at this proceeding of the Parliament of <hi>Tholouſe.</hi> For
in all times it hath made appear in all ſorts of occaſions and exceſſive hate againſt them
of the P. R. R. So far, that King <hi>Charles</hi> the IX. having ordained by his Edict of 1570.
that untill ſuch times as the Chambers of the Edict ſhould be Eſtabliſhed, they of the
ſaid Religion might refuſe in the Parliaments four Judges of the Chamber, wherein
their Proceſs were depending without expreſſing any cauſe, and without prejudice to
the ordinary right of Chalenges, but as for the Parliament of <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> it was declared
to be wholly refuſable in proceſs, wherein they of that Religion were intereſted. And
in caſe they could not agree of another Parliament, it was ordered that the Parties
ſhould be ſent back to the Court of Requeſts, to be there Judged with final determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Afterward in the Year 1573. when the Towns of the P. R. R. gave Hoſtages
to the ſame King, it was Decreed that they might be ſent to any Town of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
which it pleaſed him ſaving that of <hi>Tholouſe;</hi> the Royal authority, the publick Faith,
and the Law of Nations, being not judged a ſufficient warrant from the violence of
that Parliament. Alſo in the Edict of 1577. which in the 32, and 33. Articles did im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
that the Catholick Officers ſerving the Chambers of the Edict were to be taken from
the Parliaments, that of <hi>Tholouſe</hi> was excepted, and it was ordained that the Catholick
Commiſſioners of the Chamber of the Edict in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> ſhould be taken from other
Parliaments, or from the Grand Council, which was executed in that ſort, till the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
being diſpleaſed to ſee themſelves ſo Chaſtized, promiſed to moderate it ſelf and
to do Juſtice. But they have not obſerved their Promiſe, and have alwayes continued
to give ſuch great proofs of their ill will, that there is now no more cauſe to truſt them
than heretofore. The grief is, that the other Parliaments have imitated their example,
and a certain ſpirit of fierceneſs and averſion hath ſo pre-poſſeſſed them for ſome time,
that they of the P. R. R. can well ſay, that they and their Liberties are at an end, if
they muſt abide under a Juriſdiction ſo contrary and averſe. Witneſs the Decree of the
Parliament of <hi>Remes</hi> againſt <hi>James Caillion Seiur de la Touche,</hi> and the Parliaments of
<hi>Pau, Bordeaux,</hi> and <hi>Rouen,</hi> have done of late things which render them no leſs formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>

which ſubjects them unto Parliaments, in many of which there are not ſo much
as any Counſellors of the P. R. R. for to defend their innocence. He will maintain
of his Juſtice and equitable Goodneſs, the Chambers of the Edict in their power, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
permitting any breach to be made upon their Juriſdiction. He will remove the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions

Apoſtates, and Blaſphemers, leaving to all his Subjects full liberty of Conſcience,
which the Edicts confirmed by his Majeſty have eſtabliſhed throughout the Realm; and
for that perſon named <hi>Gayrard</hi> in particular, your Majeſty is beſought to cauſe him to
be freed from Priſon, by evacuating the Decree made againſt him by the Parliament of
<hi>Tolouſe,</hi> and ordaining that the warrant of his impriſonment be cancelled and the Gaoler

               <head>A brief Table of the Eſtate of thoſe of the P. R. R.</head>
               <p>After all theſe ſeveral obſervations which a hard neceſſity hath in a manner haled from
the breaſt of thoſe of the P. R. R. It is now eaſie to judge unto what extremity they
are reduced, and how deplorable their condition is, if the King to whom they look as
their only ſupport on Earth do not ſuffer himſelf to be touched with their ſupplications
and their Tears. For at length, what can be thought of their Eſtate?</p>
               <p>They behold the moſt part of their Temples to be condemned and demoliſhed in all
the Provinces of the Realm, ſo that a poſſeſſion of threeſcore and ten years and titles
authentick could not ſave them. They dare no more correſpond one with another,
nor write of their affairs. Their Miniſters dare not Preach, without expoſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to the peril of being informed againſt to the Juſtices, for not having ſpoken with
all reſpect of the Catholick Religion. They cannot any more cauſe any Books to be
Printed to defend their Doctrine, without the permiſſion of the Magiſtrates and conſent
of his Majeſties Attorneys, which makes the Impreſſion impoſſible. They have no more
liberty to hold their Colloquies for the conduct of their flocks, and for the exerciſe of
their Diſcipline. In the interval of Provincial Synods, it is forbidden them to receive
any Candidates, to the end that their Churches may often remain whole years without
Miniſters; and conſequently without conſolation, without Sermons, without Sacraments.
The Synods National are refuſed them, or conſented to at ſuch diſtance from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that they ſerve for little elſe than to make them feel their Miſery; and in the mean
while they hinder them from calling one Provincial Synod after another, for the affairs
for which they provide. The Schools are taken from them in all places, and they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
any longer cauſe their Children to be inſtructed by Maſters unſuſpected. Their
Children themſelves are raviſht from them every day to be thrown into Cloyſters, and to
heap up the meaſure of this evil uſage which is ſufficient to cauſe pity in the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible,
their Fathers are condemned to pay a Penſion to thoſe places where they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
them with moſt bitter ſorrow. All wayes of getting their Liveli-hood are denyed
them. For they are excluded from all Charges, from all profeſſions, from all Arts,
from all the moſt mechanick Trades; And if one of them be received into any myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
it is a grace ſo rare as it doth not deſerve to be accounted of, and is bought ſo dear
that the profits of his Trade will not of a long time equal the expence he muſt be at
to enter it. They have not only taken from them the means to gain their bread, but
they have alſo brought in innovations to hale from them that little Eſtate which they
poſſeſs, by conſtraining them to contribute to the charges of Chappels and Guilds, to
the re-edifications and reparations of Churches and Parſonage-houſes. They are not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
of their Lives themſelves, becauſe that in Criminal Proceſs they do not permit
them to be brought before the Chambers of the Edict, and they ſubject them to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidial
Courts in caſes Provoſtal, or to Parliaments and great Chambers in pretended
Crimes of Religion. The liberty of Conſcience which is granted unto them is ſo ſtraitned,
that it is no longer a Liberty, but a Rack; becauſe they that perſiſt in their belief,
do not ſpeak of it without fear of being accuſed of Blaſphemy, thoſe who quit it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
return to it without being driven out of the Kingdom for ever: and the Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticks
who would embrace it, have not at all permiſſion to ſay it, ſo that they are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
obliged to chuſe Baniſhment or Diſſimulation; <hi>Credidi, propter quod locutus ſum,</hi>
Pſal. 116. <hi>I have believed, therefore have I ſpoken,</hi> is no more a good Maxim for them,
they muſt hold the quite contrary; <hi>Credidi propter quod tacui, I have believed, therefore have
I been ſilent.</hi> The ſick of this Religion themſelves cannot be comforted in repoſe. The
Pariſh Prieſts may trouble them without Penalty in their very beds; and there procure
unto them agonies more cruel than thoſe of Death it ſelf, finally, they are ſtill purſued
even after Death, and cannot promiſe themſelves to be quit of their travels in their
Coffins. Becauſe for the moſt part they take away their Burying-places, and they muſt
ſuſtain incredible pains who bring them to their Graves, ſo difficult do they make their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrments.</p>

See here a lively Picture of the unhappy State of thoſe of the <hi>R. R.</hi> they preſent
it to his Majeſty, with aſſurance that it need only to make him know theſe things for
to receive the effects of his Juſtice. Hitherto the Church-men have hindred him from
ſeeing the Miſeries of thoſe whoſe ruine they deſire. They themſelves who ſuffer have
been ſilent out of reſpect, hoping that their Patience would ſweeten or weary the
hatred of their Adverſaries: But the exceſs of their grief hath this day conſtrained
them to ſpeak, and to offer this ſad draught to the eyes of their Prince. They hope he
will have compaſſion of their Miſery, and his Royal goodneſs having a ſence of their
Evils, will conſent unto ſome Remedy.</p>
               <p>And that which principally promotes this hope is, that the remedy which is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
for them is the ſelf-ſame which the King hath proteſted to have in his intention,
to wit, <hi>To cauſe the Edict of</hi> Nantes <hi>to be exactly obſerved.</hi> This is all they demand of his
Majeſty; they require of him no other favour at all than the obſervation of that impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
Edict, which the beſt and moſt zealous Catholicks have named
the Eſtabliſhment of the Kingdom of God amongſt the <hi>French,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Beloi.</note> The
Law of Concord and Union,<note place="margin">Mathien</note> The true Cement of Peace, A holy
and Sacred Law,<note place="margin">Conference des Ordo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances &amp; Edicts roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aux, &amp;c.</note> A work worthy of the great King who made it,
And which deſerves not only to be imprinted in Books, but alſo to
be engraved in the memories of all them who deſire the Peace and
Welfare of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſeeing it is the Kings pleaſure to cauſe the Edict to be Religiouſly obſerved,
they of the <hi>R. R.</hi> will to that end addreſs here two Supplications to this great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch,
with all the reſpect which is due to his Sacred Majeſty.</p>
               <p>1. That the Eccleſiaſticks hereafter may not be permitted to make themſelves their
oppoſite parties neither in the Council, nor in Parliaments, nor before other Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions
when any thing is in hand that concerns the Execution or Violation of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts:
For it cannot be hoped that the Edict ever will be obſerved hereafter in the
Kingdom while theſe Church-men (whoſe Authority is ſo great, and whoſe name alone
is ſo Puiſſant and revered by the ſpirits of the Judges) ſhall become adverſe Parties
againſt them, whoſe Religion renders their perſons odious and prejudiced. This is
one of the Principal Springs of the Grievances and Griefs which are brought upon
them, and there can never be Peace nor Repoſe for them in the Nation, if this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of dealing take place; for the Eccleſiaſticks do hate them with an ardour which is
almoſt unſeparable from their Characters; if they continue in this Allowance and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
to make themſelves <hi>ex profeſſo,</hi> their Adverſe Parties, as if it were a Duty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent
upon them, they will bring thus, Suits and Vexations againſt them to an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
number. This alſo the Edict of <hi>Nantes</hi> did provide for. For in the 17, 20, 21, 29.
Articles, where it ſpeaks of inquiries touching the violations of the Edict, it is always
ſaid, That it ſhould be by the Kings Officers, to exclude therefrom the Eccleſiaſticks.
And by the Anſwer of <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>13th.</hi> unto the <hi>12th</hi> Article of the Paper of 1611.
it is expreſly imported; That the Pariſh Prieſts ſhould not make themſelves Parties in
the non-obſervation of Feaſts, agreeable to the <hi>20th</hi> Article of the Edict. If the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
Prieſts be excluded from this Inquiſition, becauſe they find it to make for their
Intereſt, to make proceſſes againſt the Proteſtants upon this point; by the ſame Reaſon
ought not the Clergy in general to be rejected as uncompetent Proſecutors, touching
the violations of the Edict, being it is their great Intereſt and one of their Principal
Satisfactions to trouble them of this Religion, and to ruine them with all their Powers?</p>
               <p>The order of Juſtice alſo requires, that Eccleſiaſticks meddle not with things but
what are purely Spiritual. It cannot be without paſſing their bounds and without at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting
an Enterprize dangerous to the Eſtate, for them to intrude themſelves into
Politick Affairs, ſuch as are the violations of Edicts. It is their part to defend their
Doctrine by their Sermons and Writings, but as for the Intereſts of State, it becomes
the Kings Miniſters and Officers only to manage them. The Eccleſiaſticks have no
Right, they have no qualification or call to this affair; All that they have to do is to
become denunciators againſt them that are culpable. But the Action and the Purſuit
belongs unto his Majeſties Officers, and the Clergy cannot pretend to it, unleſs they will
confound Spirituals with Temporals; the diſtinction whereof is ſo neceſſary for the weal
of Kings and Kingdoms. To the end therefore that theſe things may be left in their due
order and ſtation, and that the root of a thouſand Troubles otherwiſe inevitable may be
pulled up, they of the <hi>R. R.</hi> do inſtantly beſeech the King, That the Eccleſiaſticks may
contain themſelves in the Functions of their Charges, and that if any be guilty of
any violations of the Edicts, the enquiry after them only may be made by competent
Parties, who are the Kings Attornies, as it hath been always practiſed.</p>

2. The other Supplication they preſent unto his Majeſty is, That he would take
care to recall or reduce the two Declarations of <hi>April,</hi> 1666. (and others ſuch like made
ſince) to the terms of that inviolable Edict, by revoking thoſe things which are contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thereunto, and that he would be pleaſed at the ſame time to make known his Will
therein, by the means and way of a Declaration.</p>
               <p>For that ſhall quiet all and ſtop the mouth of both Catholicks and Religionaries, it will
reduce them to their former State of Tranquility and quietneſs, which they injoyed on both
ſides for many years; elſe ſuch new ſurreptitious Orders drawn from your Majeſty (without
due and impartial information) will be a Precedent and Inlet for a thouſand more, that will
totally ſubvert a Fundamental Law and Edict eſtabliſhed by your famous and wiſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors,
with the full advice and conſent of the States of the Realm, and which was by
your Majeſty often allowed and ratified; ſo that thence would follow a thouſand ſecret
and publick oppreſſions, without the redreſs or due Repreſentation to your Majeſty,
which would bring the Judgments of God upon your Majeſties Kingdoms and Throne,
(which God forbid) and might deſtroy and ſcatter a great part of your Subjects, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
their Adverſaries to thoſe Extremities againſt them which diſquieted this Nation
for many Years, and that could have no end but by eſtabliſhing that Impartial
Reconciling and Sacred Edict of <hi>Nantes.</hi>
