         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THis little Piece of Hi≈øtory has ≈øtuck in the Birth well nigh a whole year; and at la≈øt is forced to come forth an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Embryo, through the unhappy Midwifry of the Pre≈øs.</p>
            <p>Yet for thy encouragement, thou oughte≈øt to know, That there is none ≈øuch ever yet extant in the Engli≈øh Tongue. For, for the fir≈øt Part; there is, <hi>(1.)</hi> Not a more modern and later Hi≈øtory of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtendom</hi> in Engli≈øh; Nor <hi>(2.)</hi> a better in ≈øo ≈ømall a Volumn: <hi>viz.</hi> None that gives a better account of the la≈øt fore-going, and this pre≈øent Age, (which two chiefly concern us to know) that is, of the la≈øt con≈øiderable Affairs of the World, and pre≈øent ≈øtate of things. We ≈øay, there is none extant, of the like nature, ≈øo ≈øhort and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehen≈øive.</p>
            <p>And for the Second Part, It is the mo≈øt wonderful ≈øtrange≈øt Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtory ever yet known in the World, in the Engli≈øh, yea, or any other Language. And indeed, not to be parallel'd by all Hi≈øtory and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity. Whether tho≈øe Prophetical Revelations be from GOD, Man, or the Devil; yet they exceed all compari≈øon. If they be from GOD, they are the ≈øtrange≈øt and mo≈øt miraculous, ever ≈øince the Apo≈øtles days. If they be Delu≈øions and Imaginations of Man, they are the ≈øtrange≈øt ever ≈øuffer'd, or invented by Man. If la≈øtly, Devices, Fa≈øcinations, and Bewitchings of the Devil, (transform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him≈øelf into an Angel of Light, &amp;c.) they are the ≈øtrange≈øt ≈øtill; and the lea≈øt Foot≈øteps of his Cloven Foot to be di≈øcerned, that ever was in any of his Juggles. Onely we have been unhappily hindred by the Pre≈øs, from giving you a ≈øhort view and ta≈øte of the Prophecies them≈øelves, as was really intended.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:40863:3"/>
And the≈øe two things may perhaps help to make it go down with the Reader, as it is, notwith≈øtanding all its faults. For 'tis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈øs'd, there are many Defects, procur'd through manyfold Occa≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, not fit here to be mentioned. And if, Worthy Reader, thou knewe≈øt all Circum≈øtances, thou would≈øt certainly be ≈øo candid, as to pardon all Faults: Which I doubt not but thou wilt (at lea≈øt) for the good will and Endeavours of the Author.</p>

            <p>EUROPE is at this day the mo≈øt flouri≈øing part of the Univer≈øe, for Empire, Religion, and Learning, Arts and Arms, and all the high di≈øtinctions of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane kind.

It is not our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe at pre≈øent in this General Table to make Compari≈øons, and ≈øet her off by the others ≈øad countenance: but onely, in fir≈øt drawing ≈øome plain and rude Lineaments, to expo≈øe to general view her pre≈øent Portraiture and Appearance; with ≈øome pro≈øpect of her future.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Europe</hi> then might be compar'd either with other parts, or former Times of the World; and every way we ≈øhould find her to excel.

And if for va≈øtne≈øs of ≈øingle Empire, and Trea≈øure, and dependencies thereon, ≈øhe cannot come in competition with the times of the <hi>Roman</hi> Greatne≈øs, yet take her divided, and all her parts together, and ≈øhe far exceeds them.

               <p>THe Heavenly Science <hi>A≈øtronomy,</hi> which our Ance≈øtours always made highe≈øt account of, de≈øerves that We al≈øo ≈øhould follow their ≈øteps, and extol it above the Skies; e≈øpecially ≈øeeing the ≈øame was heretofore under divers Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours wholly declined and decayed, and again re≈øtored, and chiefly in the time of the Empire of Juen, Emperour <hi>Tartarean,</hi> who govern'd the <hi>Chinois</hi> above 400 years ≈øince, was rendred more exact by Co ru kim, and finally at length did too much err in the la≈øt times of the fore-going Emperour Mim. There has been found one <hi>Johan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes Adamus Schall,</hi> coming from the utmo≈øt We≈øt into <hi>China,</hi> who was expert not onely in the Art of Calculation, but al≈øo in the <hi>Theory</hi> of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, and what≈øoever pertains unto A≈øtronomy. He being brought before the Emperour our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dece≈ø≈øor, by his Command undertook the care of the Acadamy of <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> and Re≈øtoration of <hi>A≈øtronomy.</hi> But becau≈øe many under≈øtood not the fruit that flows from this Science, it could not
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40863:7"/>
then be concluded, that the Subjects ≈øhould u≈øe that Science of his. But now when I came to the Empire, and my fir≈øt care was, for the Order of Times, for the Good of the Realm, in the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn of the very fir≈øt year of my Reign, ≈øeeking an experiment of that Art, which <hi>John Adams</hi> had re≈øtor'd, I commanded to be ob≈øerv'd mo≈øt dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, the Eclip≈øe of the Sun calculated by him ≈øometime before; And it being found that, a≈øwel the Moments of Time, as the Ecliptick Points, with all other Circum≈øtances, did exactly an≈øwer his Calculation. And again, in the Spring of the following Year, when an Eclip≈øe of the Moon offered it ≈øelf, commanding the ≈øame to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerved, with the ≈øame diligence, I al≈øo found that not to erre an hairs breadth neither; wherefore I pre≈øently apprehended that this Man was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øented to us from Heaven at ≈øuch a time as this, wherein I undertook the Government of ≈øo great an Empire, and thereupon committed the whole pre≈øidence of the <hi>Mathematick Tribunal</hi> to him only. But becau≈øe <hi>John Adams</hi> from his Childhood is cha≈øt (and has led a ≈øingle life) nor will meddle with any affairs not agreeing with his Religious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of life, I thought nece≈ø≈øary, by ab≈øolute com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, to oblige him to undertake this charge, and to add the dignity of the ≈øecond Order, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Title of <hi>Ma≈øter of the Heavenly Area<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na's.</hi>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:40863:8"/>
In which office being now imployed ≈øome years, he adds daily more and more ≈øtudy and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence. And becau≈øe he has a Temple near the Gate of the City, call'd Xun che Muen, where, according to the Rites of his Law, he offers Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to God; I al≈øo contributed ≈øome ≈øupply toward the building and adorning it: And when I entred that Temple, I perceived the Images and Uten≈øils to have the appearance of extraneous and forreign things al≈øo. And concerning the Books of the Law, which I found placed on a Table, when I had ask'd what was contained in them? the ≈øaid <hi>John Adams</hi> an≈øwered, That they contain'd an explication of the Divine Law. And truly I, ≈øeeing I had formerly apply'd my mind to the Doctrine Yao Xun Cheu, and Cum Cu, I perceived ≈øomething out of their Books. In the Books Foe and I au, although I read ≈øome things, yet nothing ≈øticks in my memory. But ≈øeeing I could not hitherto, by rea≈øon of the grand Affairs of the Kingdom, look into the Books of this Divine Law, but only by the by; I cannot give an exact judgment out of them, concerning that Law. But yet when I con≈øider <hi>John Adams,</hi> who having liv'd for many years among the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nois,</hi> and with us, both ob≈øerves and practi≈øes this Law, I judge it to be exceeding Good. For <hi>John Adams</hi> does ≈øo reverence his God, that he has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40863:8"/>
this Temple to him, conforming him≈øelf to this Law, with ≈øo great mode≈øty and integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Per≈øon, for ≈øo many years, alwayes after the ≈øame manner and method; and not a jot va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying therefrom: This truly is an expre≈øs ≈øign, that 'tis a Law of the highe≈øt perfection, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>John Adams</hi> him≈øelf is ≈øeen to excel with ≈øuch mo≈øt approved vertue; ≈øeeing what that Law teaches, namely to ≈øerve God, obey Kings and Magi≈øtrates, to do evil to no man, to ≈øeek the Publick, and our Neighbour's good, he exactly fulfills with his fidelity. And would to God Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi≈øtrates, and all my Subjects, would imitate this his Indu≈øtry and Diligence in ≈øerving God, and keeping the Divine Law, and would but come any thing near it, in obeying their Emperour; without doubt it would go far better by many degrees, and more pro≈øperou≈øly with me, and the whole Kingdom. As for me, I mightily approve of, and commend this his mind, and this Law; And therefore in perpetual memory of this thing, I prefix before his Church, this Title, I um hiven hia Kim, That is, <hi>An excellent place to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate Heaven.</hi> Given at Pekin, in the ≈øeventh year of Our Empire.</p>

                  <p>It will not, perhaps, di≈øta≈øt the Reader to give a Li≈øt here of the pre≈øent Kings and Princes, according to their different Ages together.</p>

                  <p>The Je≈øuites, as has been ≈øeen by the fir≈øt part, have al≈øo promoted their Religion, even into <hi>China,</hi> but 'tis not yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come National or powerful.</p>
                  <p>It re≈øts only to draw hence their Proportions, thus;</p>
                  <p>The Proportions of <hi>Europe, A≈øia, Africa,</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> ought to be con≈øidered, as 1, 3, 4, and 7.

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:40863:24"/>
then the Heathen will ≈øurpa≈øs the Mahometans and the Chri≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in an exce≈ø≈øive proportion; for they will then have near as much more; for 'tis to be believed, that that part of the World has no other for its Inhabitants than Idolaters; ≈øeeing that they found no other at the point of good <hi>Hope,</hi> and towards the ≈øtreight of <hi>Magellan,</hi> which are the mo≈øt neighbouring Lands to this va≈øt Continent of the South, who≈øe ≈øhores onely are known unto us.</p>
                  <p>The≈øe are the three grand Branches of the Chri≈øtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in <hi>Europe,</hi> out of which ari≈øe onely three other that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come di≈øtinct and National, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Lutheran,</hi> the <hi>Calvini≈øt,</hi> and the <hi>Epi≈øcoparian,</hi> all of them Prote≈øtant and Reformed; All of them deny the Popes Supremacy and Tran≈øub≈øtantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp;c.

                     <p n="1">I. ABout the year 1250. the Empire being greatly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtracted through the Popes means and practices (who for above an hundred years had notoriou≈øly u≈øurped authority over the Emperors, and made a common practice of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating them in a manner ≈øucce≈ø≈øively, for ≈øo many years one after the other); the Empire, I ≈øay, being di≈øtracted into many Factions, each Faction cho≈øe a King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> or Emperor; in≈øomuch that there were now at one time three Elected together, and a<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>fourth a year or two after bought it, and pre≈øently left it again, and then for ≈øeveral years without any. The Empire fluctuating thus for about twenty years, and after ≈øo long an <hi>Interregnum,</hi> the Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> met at <hi>Quidlinburg,</hi> and made a League of Defence together about the year 1270.

                     <p>By this time the ≈øeven Electors had rooted them≈øelves in their u≈øurp'd Elector≈øhip, which began fir≈øt by bare permi≈ø≈øion, and under pretext of avoiding confu≈øion, and for better order in the Election, to take the Votes of all the other Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> what ≈øhould be be≈øt for the Common Intere≈øt, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards u≈øed and u≈øurped as their priviledge, and ≈øo continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, till they got to be e≈øtabli≈øhed therein by the <hi>Golden Bull.</hi>

                     <p>The Prince hereof in his Amba≈ø≈øies with the Turk, Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and Pope, King of <hi>Swede,</hi> and <hi>Danes,</hi> &amp;c. ≈øtiles him≈øelf <hi>Tzar</hi> or <hi>Emperor;</hi> though with the <hi>Poles</hi> only, <hi>Great Duke.</hi> Therefore we ≈øhall add this to the Empires al≈øo.</p>
                     <p>The la≈øt Emperor but one of the old Royal line, was <hi>John Ba≈øilid,</hi> that mo≈øt famous Tyrant, who extended his Empire, even unto <hi>Per≈øia</hi> and the <hi>Ca≈øpian</hi>-Sea, made War upon <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonia</hi> or <hi>Liefland,</hi> where receiving great defeats and lo≈ø≈øes, acted with rage and fury, commits horrible ≈ølaughters every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, both of his own, as well as of his enemies, and kill'd his hopeful Son <hi>John</hi> with his own hands. With this king the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> fir≈øt began to confederate.</p>
                     <p>To him ≈øucceeds, <hi>An.</hi> 1583, his Son <hi>Theodore,</hi> of a good di≈øpo≈øition, the la≈øt of the former race; who dying without i≈ø≈øue, <hi>Ru≈ø≈øia</hi> becomes di≈øtracted with unheard of Confu≈øions and Mi≈øeries: For through fault in Government, and the Line failing, there ≈øprang horrible Factions and Commotions in the kingdom for ten years, ≈øcarce to be parallel'd in Hi≈øtory.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>John Ba≈øilid</hi> having two Sons left, <hi>Demetrius</hi> and <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore,</hi>
                        <pb n="63" facs="tcp:40863:34"/>
the former was ≈øecretly made away and kill'd, before his Father's death, and <hi>Theodore</hi> leaving no i≈ø≈øue, leaves the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to his Brother-in-law, who proving an unmerciful Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, The Je≈øuites take occa≈øion to ≈øuborn a certain Scholar of theirs in their Colledge in <hi>Poland,</hi> a <hi>Ru≈ø≈øe</hi> by Nation, for the true <hi>Demetrius</hi> made away; ≈øo cunningly, that none of the <hi>Ru≈ø≈øians,</hi> e≈øpecially the fickle-minded multitude, doubted, but that it was the true and lawful Heir indeed, and therefore generally flock to him, which the other Tyrant ≈øeeing, either with Grief or Poy≈øon ended his dayes, <hi>An.</hi> 1605. and the fal≈øe <hi>Demetrius</hi> made ab≈øolute Monarch of <hi>Ru≈ø≈øia.</hi> The king of <hi>Poland</hi> and the Pope favouring the de≈øign. But the Ru≈ø≈øes ≈øoon ≈ømelling him out by his forreign manners and cu≈øtoms, The Nobles con≈øpire again≈øt him, and behead him the next year.</p>
                     <p>The Impo≈øtor ≈ølain, the ≈øtronger Faction thus prevailing, make <hi>Zusky</hi> the Chief their Con≈øpiracy, <hi>An.</hi> 1606, Emperor.</p>
                     <p>But then pre≈øently another <hi>Demetrius,</hi> as e≈øcaping by Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, and by and by in oppo≈øition to him a third, begin to peep up, one in the We≈øtern, the other in the Nothern parts by ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Factions, ≈øo that ≈øtil <hi>Demetrius</hi> as often as ≈ølain, ri≈øes again. But this la≈øt ≈øoon vani≈øhed.</p>
                     <p>Hereupon the <hi>Poles,</hi> the <hi>Swedes,</hi> and the <hi>Tartars</hi> take their advantage, break-in on every ≈øide, under pretext of help, and the <hi>Ru≈ø≈øians</hi> become a prey to them all.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Swedes</hi> help <hi>Zuskie,</hi> and the Poles <hi>Demetrius, Anno</hi> 1611, the <hi>Swedes</hi> take <hi>Novograd,</hi> and the <hi>Poles Smolensko.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Ru≈ø≈øes, weary of the≈øe Impo≈øtures and Confu≈øions, ≈øeek out for a forreign Prince, <hi>An.</hi> 1612<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> ≈øome for the <hi>Pole,</hi> others for the <hi>Swede.</hi> The Pole takes <hi>Mo≈øco</hi> (it ≈øelf) and with Fire and Sword lay it in the du≈øt, 200000 Ru≈ø≈øes peri≈øhing therein. The <hi>Swedes</hi> eject the <hi>Poles</hi> out of <hi>Mo≈øco</hi> again. But the Southern <hi>Ru≈ø≈øes</hi> take <hi>Zusky,</hi> ≈øend him into <hi>Poland,</hi> and by recommendation and the power of the Polanders, chu≈øe the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:40863:35"/>
King of <hi>Polands</hi> Son, create him Great Duke: and the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern chu≈øe <hi>Charles</hi> the Brother of <hi>Gu≈øtavus Adolphus</hi> King of Sweden.</p>
                     <p>But the <hi>Ru≈ø≈øes</hi> loth to fall under the power of the <hi>Poles,</hi> and de≈øirous of ≈øettlement after ≈øuch tire≈øome confu≈øions, and ≈øee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them≈øelves a ≈øcorn and prey to ≈øtrangers, do by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and coun≈øel fir≈øt of a Butcher only, ≈øeek out a fit per≈øon of their own Nation, and make choice at la≈øt of their Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch of <hi>Mo≈øco</hi>'s Son, <hi>An.</hi> 1615, who pre≈øently makes this But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher Trea≈øurer and General, and at length ≈øettles this va≈øt Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and manages it in a more con≈øtant way of Peace with the <hi>Turks, Tartars, Poles,</hi> and <hi>Swedes,</hi> than any of his predece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øors before, and founds the pre≈øent Family and Empire.</p>
                     <p>Yet the ≈øecond <hi>Demetrius</hi>'s Widow hires the <hi>Co≈ø≈øacks</hi> to ≈øet up her young Son, not of age, who takes many Ea≈øtern Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of <hi>Ru≈ø≈øia,</hi> with the Title of <hi>Kingdom</hi> for her Son, the fourth fal≈øe <hi>Demetrius;</hi> But this Kingdom la≈øted but two years: for both Mother and Son were taken and ≈ølain by the <hi>Ru≈ø≈øes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So the Emperor fir≈øt makes peace with <hi>Swede,</hi> who re≈øtor'd to him the Great Dukedom of <hi>Novograd,</hi> but keeps <hi>Livonia,</hi> (and other Northern Provinces) with the City <hi>Novograd,</hi> and add it to their Crown, ≈øince the occa≈øion of War between them. He then be≈øieges <hi>Smolensko</hi> 1634, and there receives a great and ≈øhameful Overthrow and De≈øtruction by the <hi>Poles;</hi> which Dukedom has ever ≈øince been the Apple of Contention, as well as formerly, betwixt them. He reigned till 1645.</p>
                     <p>To whom ≈øucceeded his young Son <hi>Alexius,</hi> the pre≈øent Emperor; In 1646 they made peace with <hi>Poland,</hi> and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Kings minority there was ≈øome troubles and di≈øtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers in the State, and an horrible Sedition 1648. but all ≈øoon quietly ≈øetled.</p>

                        <hi>Anno</hi> 1654. The Mo≈øcovites invade <hi>Lituania;</hi> overcome <hi>Smolensko;</hi> and 1655, take <hi>Vilna;</hi> invade <hi>Livonia.</hi> 1656,

                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Great, ≈øirnamed <hi>the Catholick King of Arragon,</hi> laid the Foundations of the la≈øt and greate≈øt Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy of <hi>Spain,</hi> by marriage with <hi>I≈øabel</hi> Queen of <hi>Ca≈øtile,</hi> &amp;c. towards the year 1480. in which Race continued ever ≈øince.</p>
                     <p>Whereupon mighty things en≈øued: (1.) Perpetual Union betwixt tho≈øe two potent Kingdoms. (2.)

                     <p>And thus the Spaniards fir≈øt became con≈øiderable in the World, and a Terror to Neighbours; and ≈øuddenly look'd like the beginners of a fifth, or Univer≈øal Monarchy of the World, at lea≈øt the New-World:</p>

Monarch, to promote the Catholick Cau≈øe on Religion; to root out Hereticks, &amp;c. which has been alwayes their pretext, and which they have been alwayes zealous and mighty ≈øtick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers for.

                     <p>So that now this Common-wealth became divided into two factions, and thence broke out into cruel Wars, between <hi>Zu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich</hi> and the Romi≈øh <hi>Cantons.</hi> The Prote≈øtants at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning are wor≈øted. <hi>Zuinglius</hi> him≈øelf Slain in the head of the Battel, 1531; his heart remaining whole (like <hi>Cranmers)</hi> in the mid≈øt of the Fire, untouched, as is ≈øaid, after all the re≈øt con≈øumed to A≈øhes.</p>
                     <p>At la≈øt after various ≈øucce≈ø≈øes and defeats on both ≈øides, they agree the bu≈øine≈øs upon this condition, That every one ≈øhould imbrace what Religion they liked, and force be offer'd to none for Religion: but that the ancient fir≈øt League ≈øhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violably and religiou≈øly kept and ob≈øerved.

                     <p>The foundation, and likewi≈øe Super≈øtructure of this Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Principallity (con≈øi≈øting of ≈øuch twofold power,) was fir≈øt laid, and then built and perfected by the working of the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtery of Iniquity, gradually. Which to ≈øcent and hunt out, would require the Hi≈øtory of all ages and places; and too long therefore for this ≈øhort Table: Yet to repre≈øent it obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous at one view, we can but briefly take notice, and touch up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on only the chief matters of fact, without excur≈øion or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                     <p n="1">(1.) There was fir≈øt di≈øtinction of Clergy and Laity. (2.) di≈øtinction, degrees, and dignities of Clergy, for order and unity, to avoid ≈øchi≈øme, and factions. (3.) The≈øe degrees, dignities, and di≈øtinctions of offices in the Church, ≈øuited and proportioned very much, to tho≈øe in State, and tho≈øe Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent on the ≈øtate, thereby ≈øetting up <hi>Imperium</hi> in <hi>Imperio,</hi> or a Government in Government. (4.) Contending for preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, priority, precedency, &amp; ≈øupremacy in the ≈øeveral Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and Governments. (5.) La≈øtly an univer≈øal ≈øupremacy, <hi>i. e.</hi> of one over all. Fir≈øt Spiritual, in Eccle≈øia≈øtick affairs. Secondly Temporal, in Politick affairs; at lea≈øt aimed at, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured, and pretended, and in ≈øome mea≈øure u≈øurped, and po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed.</p>
                     <p>The ≈øpiritual ≈øupremacy began by Pope <hi>Boniface,</hi> about <hi>An.</hi> 606. under the title of univer≈øal Bi≈øhop, to which ≈øeveral things conduced. (1.) Fir≈øt, Accommodating the Honours and Governments of the Church, to tho≈øe of the pre≈øent ≈øtate, that is, of the Empire become Chri≈øtians; and ≈øo mixing Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and Temporal power, and ≈øetting up Empire in Empire,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:40863:62"/>
under <hi>Con≈øtantine</hi> the Great, turn'd Chri≈øtian. For becau≈øe, they mu≈øt needs acknowledge, according to that famous max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im among≈øt them, that the Church was in the Commonwealth, not the Commonwealth in the Church; Therefore upon that foundation, the Fathers in the Council of <hi>Calcedon,</hi> rai≈øed this ≈øuper≈øtructure, that the Honours in the Church ≈øhould be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated unto tho≈øe in the State. From whence would ea≈øily follow, an Head of the Church, as well as of the Empire, at lea≈øt as far as the Empire reach.</p>
                     <p>Hereupon <hi>Con≈øtantine</hi> dividing the Empire into fourteen Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oce≈ø≈øes, each Dioce≈øs into Provinces, and each Province into Cities, and placing in every Dioce≈øs a Vicegerent, or Viceroy, in every Province, a Pre≈øident, and in every City, a Defendor, or Governor: the Church accordingly in≈øtitute, for every Vicegerent, a Primate, or Patriarch, in the principal City of the Dioce≈øs; for every Pre≈øident, a Metropolitan, in the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis of the Province; and for every Governor, a Bi≈øhop in every City, with permi≈ø≈øion of the ≈øuperior Emperor; and then a Pope over all would follow of cour≈øe naturally, for the Emperor him≈øelf, &amp;c. in the chief ≈øeat of the Empire.</p>
                     <p n="2">(2.) There was ≈øuiting Temporal means Tythes, Revenues, Riches, proportional to the Honours, Dignities, Degrees and Offices of Government in the Church, by the ≈øaid <hi>Con≈øtantine,</hi> which a Voice in the Air proclaimed to be a Pe≈øt ≈øown in the Church.</p>
                     <p n="3">(3.) The Bi≈øhop of Rome remained as yet, at lea≈øt account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the mo≈øt Orthodox, and their Religion, as in the heart and center of the Empire, ≈øeemed mo≈øt to flouri≈øh. Hence (1.) frequent appeals to this Church as the true≈øt and be≈øt. (2.) Thence a≈ø≈øuming to be ≈øupream Judg &amp; interpretor, or mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator of controver≈øie, of Truth and Error, and to be vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the Canon or rule of Faith. (3.) La≈øtly to be the only infallible Judge and determiner, and as it were, Rulers or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulers of the Cannons, and to ≈øit in the Temple of God as God;
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:40863:62"/>
and all to ≈øubmit to the deci≈øion of the Bi≈øhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> at lea≈øt pre≈øiding in Council.</p>
                     <p n="4">(4.) The Bi≈øhop of <hi>Romes</hi> Seat, was the Seat or metropolis of the Empire, thereby gaining great authority, power, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, and no le≈øs fame, e≈øteem, and repute over all the World, &amp;c. But we can but hint things here in brief.</p>
                     <p n="5">(5.) The Empire began ≈øoon to be divided into the Ea≈øtern and We≈øtern. Where upon the Ea≈øtern Bi≈øhops contend for precedency and ≈øupremacy upon the removal of the Seat of Empire to <hi>Con≈øtantinople,</hi> and the outward flouri≈øhing of that Church.</p>
                     <p n="6">(6.) At la≈øt upon the further breakings and weaknings of the Empire, he obtains of <hi>Phocas,</hi> killing the Emperor <hi>Mauri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> in a tumult of the Souldiers, the ab≈øolute ≈øupremacy, and Title of Univer≈øal Bi≈øhop, about 606. as afore≈øaid.</p>
                     <p>In the≈øe contentions for this ≈øpiritual ≈øupremacy, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for their Title, and claim the donation or delegation of Chri≈øt thereto, the Succe≈ø≈øion to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> the donation and Con≈øtitution of <hi>Con≈øtantine,</hi> the fir≈øt Chri≈øtian univer≈øal Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Having got the Supremacy of the Church in ≈øpirituals, the ≈øame my≈øtery of Iniquity works for Supremacy al≈øo in Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porals, over all Emperors, Kings, and Princes, and as it were univer≈øal Monarchy. For from univer≈øal Bi≈øhop, clearly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows univer≈øal Excommunication, even of Emperors, Rings and Monarchs, afterwards practi≈øed. From Excommunicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, depo≈øing. From depo≈øing, di≈øpo≈øing of Ringdoms. From di≈øpo≈øing (to whom ≈øhould he be more kind then him≈øelf) U≈øurping and po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øing. So naturally one Wedge drives in and makes way for another; And having got in his head, ca≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wriggles in his whole Body, &amp;c. Be≈øides the Church was to be preferred above the State, and the Head of the Church, above the Head of the State. And ≈øo the Spiritual Supremacy prepares and makes way for the Temporal<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> For there is no end
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:40863:63"/>
of Pride, and Ambition, ≈øo long as any equall or ≈øuperior; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øs he be above all that is called God, like <hi>Lucifer,</hi> who would be above God him≈øelf, and all Government or ≈øubjection. But we mu≈øt not in≈øi≈øt.</p>
                     <p>As to this Temporal Power, Particulars of fact in brief lye thus; as well as we can ob≈øerve things, as they fell out. Only fir≈øt take notice the foundation of his ≈øpirituall Supremacy a little more particular, in the order of time.</p>
                     <p n="1">(1) By the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> in <hi>Con≈øtantines</hi> time, the four Patriarchs, of <hi>Rome,</hi> of <hi>Jeru≈øalem,</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi> were all equal. (2) about the year 410. the Bi≈øhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> would pretend to be the fir≈øt Patriarch; and to that end fal≈øifies the Canon, and ≈øends it to the Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> where it was rejected as fal≈øe. (3) The Imperial Seat being tran≈ølated to <hi>Con≈øtantinople,</hi> the Bi≈øhop thereof was made a fifth Patriarch in order, and not long after the ≈øecond, the re≈øt oppo≈ø≈øing, &amp;c. in vain. (4) The Lombards overcoming <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and the Pope not well plea≈øed with the Emperor, &amp;c. The Bi≈øhop of <hi>Con≈øtantinople,</hi> endeavours the Title of Univer≈øal Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhope, and obtains it of <hi>Mauritius</hi> the Emperor, the Bi≈øhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> to the utmo≈øt oppo≈øing, and exclaiming again≈øt it, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable Pride, and the ≈øigne of antichri≈øt. And whether out of a good mind, or becau≈øe he could not be uppermo≈øt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf, laments the corruptions of the Church and Clergy. For of the Prie≈øts, he complains, the World is full of them, and yet but few Labours in the Lords Harve≈øt. We take upon us the office, but di≈øcharge it who li≈øt; And I think no di≈øhonour to God can be ≈øhewed ≈øo great, as that which it tolerated in Prie≈øts.

                     <p>The ≈øaid <hi>Gregory</hi> cryed out, <hi>O times, O manners! The world is all on fire with Wars; Chri≈øtians are de≈øtroyed by Idolaters; Cities and Temples, by Barbarians; and yet Prie≈øts, as it were, in≈øul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting over Calamities; u≈øurp the names of vanity, and make o≈øten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of profane Titles to them≈øelves;</hi> thereby taxing this arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance of the Con≈øtantinopolitan Patriarch. (5) <hi>Phocas</hi> killing <hi>Mauritius,</hi> and invading the Empire, to oblige the Bi≈øhop of <hi>Rome</hi> to keep <hi>Italy</hi> the better in quiet and obedience; grants the dignitiy of Univer≈øal Bi≈øhop to <hi>Boniface</hi> reque≈øting it, and decrees the Sea (or Seat) of <hi>Rome,</hi> to be the Head of all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. Which decrees <hi>Boniface</hi> publi≈øhes in a Synod of 62 Bi≈øhops, and obtains it, not without oppo≈øition and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>After the≈øe things, the Ea≈øtren or Greek Church broke off from the Latine or Roman. <hi>Italy</hi> by ≈øeveral Ma≈øters began to be quite pluck'd from the Empire, and <hi>Rome</hi> to come into the Popes power, and ≈øeveral Schi≈øms and Here≈øies in the Church, and contentions and quarrels between Popes and Emperors thereupon, &amp;c. The Pope alienates the Romans, or people of <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> from the Emperor, brings them to oppo≈øe him, amid≈øt the troubles of <hi>Italy.</hi> And condemns Emperors of the Ea≈øt of Here≈øie, and at la≈øt excommunicates them. And out of the ruines of <hi>Italy,</hi> works his own greatne≈øs, and by his means, and through his occa≈øion, a new Empire is ≈øet up in the We≈øt, by the <hi>Franks,</hi> under <hi>Charles</hi> the Great: and great Temporal Power, and Dominion, and E≈øtates, accrew'd to the Church; and the Pope at length claims ≈øuperiority above the Emperors them≈øelves, &amp;c.

After the Supremacy of the Pope thus e≈øtabli≈øhed, the Greeke Church in the Ea≈øt ≈øeperates from the Roman; not only for Primacy, but other high points of Religion; as was now ≈øaid.</p>
                     <p>About the year 710. aro≈øe the controver≈øie about Images.

                     </p>
                     <p>Upon the≈øe differences <hi>Italy</hi> is torn from the Empire by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers U≈øurpers, and <hi>Rome</hi> by the Pope, &amp;c.</p>

From which he would pretend to be above Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and Kings, and to be his right to Crown, confirm, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe them, if not di≈øpo≈øe of their Kingdoms.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Charls</hi> (at length) rea≈ø≈øumes the ancient and original Imperial Dignity and Power, to Govern the Church, call Councils, and order Papal Elections, and confirm and inve≈øt them, &amp;c. again≈øt all begun u≈øurpations and incroachments of the Pope; and aws <hi>Italy;</hi> And keeps the Pope ≈øtill Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; which Authority of the Empire was prety well upheld, during the Caroline Race.</p>
                     <p>The Pope in the mean while under pretext of the Chri≈øtian Religion, and converting Infidels and the Nations, increa≈øes in Wealth, Power, and Authority over the World, Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the≈øe Decrees of Holy Church; <hi>Out of the Church no Salvation.

His right, as afore≈øaid to create, confirm, excommunicate, and depo≈øe Kings, and di≈øpo≈øe Kingdoms for the cau≈øe of Religion, &amp;c.

And this Opinion was brought about to prevail in the World, that they might redeem their ≈øins by good deeds and charitable works and ≈øervices, for the Church again≈øt it's enemies, &amp;c. Hence Riches, and Revenues of the Clergy, and Ho≈øts and ≈øwarms of clergy men. Hence Churches, Temples, Abbies, Mona≈øtries without number, &amp;c. for the Redemtion of Souls. Hence Expeditions, Holy Wars, Leagues and undertakings for the Church. Hence Pardons, Indulgences, and devices for mony, &amp;c. 'Twould be endle≈øs to mention particulars, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The Pope having thus erected his Throne in the Con≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of men, &amp; ≈øtrongly ≈øeated there, through Ignorance and blind Zeal and Devotion, begins to play Rex in the World.</p>

                     <p>The Pope therefore now practi≈øes all wayes he can again≈øt the ≈øuperiority of the Emperor, and from being any wayes ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to his Authority, or control and to undermine all Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy in Temporals, pre≈øuming that all power is given to him, both in Heaven and Earth, in the Church and State, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>'Till in the end, they come not only to let the Emperors have nothing to do, in their Election, Confirmation, and Inve≈øtiture; but al≈øo to have all in a manner them≈øelves to do, in the Creation and Coronation of the Emperors.</p>

                     <p>And about the year 1000. as ≈øome write, <hi>Gregory the fifth,</hi> appoints Electors for choo≈øing the Emperors, whereby they afterwards became weakned, and the Empire broken into factions and parties; and the Pope thereby to have the better opportunity to work his own ends; and to rai≈øe his greatne≈øs out of others ruines; ≈øtriving now to be uppermo≈øt, not only in Church, but State too; and to be above even the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors them≈øelves.</p>
                     <p>For after this time open and down right Tyranny over the Emperors, begins to manife≈øt it ≈øelf.

                     <p>Then about 1050. <hi>Leo the</hi> 9<hi>th.</hi> inve≈øted by the Emperor is per≈øwaded by <hi>Hildebrand</hi> to put off his pontificalibus or papal Robes, in his journey from <hi>Germany</hi> to <hi>Rome;</hi> to wave the Emperor, and have a new election from the Roman Clergy; and then made <hi>Hildebrand</hi> Cardinal, who manag'd all at his plea≈øure.

                     <p>About 1240. the twentieths of Eccle≈øia≈øtick Revenues are obtained for the Pope. It came afterwards to the tenths, nay the fifths, and fourths too in ≈øome Kingdoms, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>This Pope demanded al≈øo the payment of the Twentieths, before granted, and afterwards of the Tenths of all Revenues and Profits of the Church, adding grievous threatnings, if they were not paid; and by his <hi>Legate</hi> in <hi>Poland,</hi> one fifth of all: Afterwards he per≈øwaded the French King to make War again≈øt <hi>Henry the</hi> 3<hi>d.</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and to make him either yeeld to all the Pope demanded, or to drive him out of his Kingdom.</p>

Which was complyed with by the Clergy of <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c. He threw a≈øhes into an Arch Bi≈øhops Eyes on A≈øhwen≈øday, becau≈øe he was a Gibelline, and took the Emperors part; excommunicated <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> and gave away his Kingdom to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror; and boa≈øted, <hi>That all powers were ≈øubject to him.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtituted the fir≈øt Jubilee of Triumph therefore; when in that great concour≈øe of people (and to make it great indeed, every one that did repair to it, was to have a plenary remi≈ø≈øion of all his ≈øins; What better invitation, could there be devi≈øed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øides the fine ≈øight to be ≈øeen) The Pope (carried in Proce≈ø≈øion in a Chair of ≈øtate; wirh a Sumptuous Canopy born over his Head by Kings, or Nobles, for ≈øo he is in the year of Jubilee,) ≈øhewed him≈øelf openly, before them all, <hi>one day in the habit of a Pope, and the next, in the habit of an Emperor, and every day cau≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed two Swords to be carried before him, in token, that all power Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle≈øia≈øtical and Civil, did belong unto him,</hi> Yet King <hi>Philip</hi> in contempt of his Bull of excommunication, gave the proud Fool his own, writing back thus, <hi>Let your mighty Fool≈øhip know, that we are ≈øubject to none in Temporals.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And from this time forward the year of Jubilee has been u≈ø'd, as a con≈øtant Fair, as it were, for the trade of <hi>Indulgence;, Agnus Dei's, and other fine Sanctified knacks,</hi> That ≈øo the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple invited thereby, to come or ≈øend from all parts to <hi>Rome</hi> to ≈øpend their Mony, might not have nothing for it. This was a
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:40863:72"/>
pretty ≈øtep towards making pardons and indulgences directly ≈øealable afterwards. And that it might not be ≈øo long a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they not long after reduced it, from every hundredth to every fiftyeth, and at la≈øt to every twentyfifth year.</p>
                     <p>In his time about the year 1300. the forementioned facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Guelphs,</hi> and <hi>Gibellines,</hi> the one for the Pope, and the other for the Emperor, grew to their height, and have la≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all ages ever ≈øince, almo≈øt to ours more or le≈øs.</p>
                     <p>Not long after <hi>Clement the fifth</hi> removed the Sea from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Avignon</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> where it continued ≈øeventy years. His inauguration was ennobled with the pre≈øence of ≈øeveral Kings and Princes; in which Pomp, he lo≈øt a Carbuncle out of his Hat, valued at a great rate. He rooted out the Knights Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plars, as too good for his turn; excommunicated the <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines, Luccans,</hi> and <hi>Venetians. Who≈øe Duke, he made come, and beg pardon, chain'd like a Dog, and fed under his Table.</hi> He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated the Emperor of the Ea≈øt becau≈øe he would not ≈øubject him≈øelf, and the Greeke Church to the Roman, nor ≈øuffer appeals to <hi>Rome,</hi> as his Father before him had done. And likewi≈øe dur≈øt, neither fearing God nor man, forgive pre≈øently the Monk that then poy≈øoned the Emperor of the We≈øt in the Ho≈øt, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>They were now arived to their utmo≈øt height, and became ≈øo in≈øolent and imperious, that they could be indured no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. So that about this time there were ≈øeveral Meetings and A≈ø≈øemblyes of the Empire again≈øt their intolerable domineer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>An.</hi> 1333. The Pope leaves at his death, a va≈øt trea≈øure of twenty milions of Crowns, which they had ama≈ø≈øed thus to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, by their extortions, and devi≈øes. For all things e're this time had been become ≈øaleable at <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now it was that the Emperors, wholly in a manner, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on the Popes will and plea≈øure; who a≈ø≈øume right and Soveraignty over the Cities Subject to the Empire in <hi>Italy.</hi>
                        <pb n="140" facs="tcp:40863:73"/>
And the Emperors give up, as it were, all their Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, ≈øo long conte≈øted for, to the Popes. For <hi>Clement the</hi> 6<hi>th.</hi> after 1340. to dimini≈øh ≈øtill more and more the Emperors Right and Authority, created Vicount Vicars to rule the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. Yet the Emperor again in requital, in≈øtituted other Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cars to governe the Church. This and other things ≈øo netled him, that he would never be reconciled with the Emperor, except he put him≈øelf, and all his, into his Holine≈øs di≈øpo≈øal. Which for quietne≈øs ≈øake, and to prevent the ≈øhedding of Chri≈øtian bloud, the Emperor doth: The Princes of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire exclaim again≈øt the Popes tyrannical u≈øurpations. The Arch-Bi≈øhop of <hi>Mentz</hi> is depo≈ø'd for but ≈øpeaking on the Fm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors behalf: and the other Electors, partly brib'd, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly awed, agree to ≈øet up his Son. <hi>Thus the Empire went down, and the Popedom up.</hi> And then cozens the world with his year of Jubilee, reduced to every fifth, and the fine trick of Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, to plea≈øe the people, and drive a gainful trade to the Popes. He gave away the <hi>Canaries</hi> al≈øo to King <hi>Lewis.</hi> And <hi>fifty thou≈øand per≈øons had acce≈ø≈øe to his pre≈øence, in one day, and di≈ømi≈ø≈øed again.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>About 1352. The Emperor, to gain Pope <hi>Innocent the</hi> 6<hi>th</hi>'s favour, grants him in a manner all his Authority in <hi>Germany;</hi> and three years after is crowned at <hi>Rome,</hi> by the hand of the Popes Legate; (him≈øelf re≈øiding ≈øtill at <hi>Avignon)</hi> promi≈øing not to ≈øtay one day longer at <hi>Rome,</hi> (now the Pope was ab≈øent) then after his Coronation.</p>
                     <p>About 1380. <hi>Clement the</hi> 7<hi>th.</hi> is ≈øet up anti-Pope, by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of French Cardinals again≈øt <hi>Urbane the</hi> 6<hi>th.</hi> for being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt returning to <hi>Avignon.</hi> The French and Spaniard ≈øide with <hi>Clement:</hi> the <hi>Italians, Engli≈øh, Dutch,</hi> &amp;c. with <hi>Urbane.

                     <p>And thus we have in general repre≈øented the foundations and Revolutions of the Papal Hierarchy, or Kingdom of the Pope; both Temporal and Spiritual; its ri≈øe, growth, increa≈øe height and decrea≈øe; not being able well to comprehend ≈øo long and my≈øterious an Hi≈øtory, and ≈øo confu≈øed with all others in le≈øs room, and willing only to touch upon chief particulars of their u≈øurpations, incroachings, and domineerings, down to our times, that ≈øo you might have a Map or Table, and plain veiw, as it were at once, of this Eccle≈øia≈øtical and Prie≈øtly King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.

                     <p>The Popedom Spiritual, or Univer≈øal Hierarchy, was founded by <hi>Boniface,</hi> as Univer≈øal Bi≈øhop, and high Prie≈øt.

                     <p>For towards the year 1500. Pope <hi>Alexander the 6th.</hi> as if he was Ma≈øter of the whole Earth, di≈øtributed, by his Bull, all the new World between <hi>Ferdinand the 5th.</hi> King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> King of <hi>Portugal.</hi> Here was a wonderful donation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, of the World from Ea≈øt to We≈øt, parted between two Princes.</p>
                     <p>And to make them agree, it was accorded, that the Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue≈øs ≈øhould equally ≈øhare from the fortunate I≈ølands, or <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> by one ≈øtreight line from <hi>North</hi> to <hi>South,</hi> for the fir≈øt Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian, an hundred and eighty degrees (that is, one half of the World) Ea≈øtward; and the Spaniard, as many We≈øtward; And that both one and the other, ≈øhould have right to take po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of all the Earth they could ≈øeize on; and all upon this title for≈øooth, That they ≈øhould convert the Infidels, and Barbarous Nations to the Chri≈øtian Faith; which they did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed more like Infidels and Barbarians then Chri≈øtians.

                  <p>So that new Di≈ø≈øentions, Divi≈øions, Schi≈ømes, Hatreds, and Scandals aro≈øe, and even tho≈øe who were mo≈øt per≈øwaded of the≈øe Revelations began to he≈øitate and doubt.

                        <p n="1">(1.) Fir≈øt I the Pa≈øtor of the People of <hi>Puchow,</hi> pre≈øently
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:40863:93"/>
the ≈øame day that I received yours, calling together the Elders of my Church, and my fellow Labourer, un≈øealed in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence your letters that concern'd us jointly; and perceiving the contents, I wrote the next day early to the Brethren of <hi>Ledna,</hi> and informed them that our fellow Brother ≈øent to us was come, and had brought ≈øingular commands to us all, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated them to come unto us, which they did the ≈øame 9<hi>th of July</hi> at evening. Where I delivered into <hi>Drabricious's</hi> hands tho≈øe that concerned him, and invited him to lodge with me all night, and the re≈øt ≈øhould under≈øtand what the bu≈øine≈øs was to morrow.</p>
                        <p n="2">(2.) The next day, after publick prayers in the Holy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, we entered into mine, the Pa≈øtor's, Hou≈øe. Where after a general ≈øalutation of <hi>Drabricius,</hi> (which could not be done conveniently in the Temple,) I ≈øaid, that we had an hard bu≈øine≈øs before us, and therefore need again begin with Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of mercy from God, to obtain the Grace of the Holy Spirit. When <hi>Drabricius</hi> ≈øaid, <hi>Do you pray here, I will go a≈øide into my Chamber, and perform my prayers al≈øo. And ≈øo went out.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">(3.) We therefore, fir≈øt, ≈øinging that P≈øalm, <hi>Come Holy Gho≈øt,</hi> &amp;c. we all pro≈øtrated our ≈øelves on our knees, and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red forth our Groans to the Lord, in a prayer appointed for this very purpo≈øe.</p>
                        <p n="4">(4.) After prayer, we ≈øate together in A≈ø≈øembly, and the Pa≈øtor of the place giving thanks that they had appeared at his de≈øire, informed them what was to be done. Then the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Epi≈øtle to all was read. Next the Oath pre≈øcribed for <hi>Drabricius (at the horrour of which almo≈øt all of us ≈øtood a≈øtoni≈øhed and terrified.)</hi> And <hi>Fr. Samuel</hi> gave his In≈øtructions to be read.</p>
                        <p n="5">(5.) After <hi>≈øome deliberation had</hi> upon the≈øe things, <hi>Drabricius</hi>
                           <pb n="181" facs="tcp:40863:93"/>
was called, and being asked by the Pa≈øtor of the place, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he would hear the Letters from <hi>the Reverend Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,</hi> dated to this A≈ø≈øembly, and under≈øtand the contents? He a≈ø≈øented, adding, <hi>I was not ignorant for ≈øome weeks what was about to be done concerning me; For the Lord ≈øhew'd it to me. If I had known before, I would have took you along with me, to ≈øee.</hi> I reply'd, let that alone in its own place. Let us come to the bu≈øine≈øs.</p>
                        <p n="6">(6.) Fir≈øt therefore was read unto him the common Epi≈øtle; Then the form of the Oath (but before this was read I did ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moni≈øh and be≈øeech him, that he would weigh all things ≈øeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øly. For therein were terrible things, and the matter here in agitation concerned the Salvation of his Soul.) And la≈øtly the in≈øtructions given to <hi>Sam. Jun. To all which when he thereupon an≈øwered nothing,</hi> He was again asked, Whether he was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be dealt with according to the≈øe pre≈øcripts here? <hi>He an≈øwered directly. Yes, I will.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="7">(7.) Whereupon the third Que≈øtion was propo≈øed. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther therefore he did account, and would have accounted all his Revelations for truly Divine? And whether he did yet a≈ø≈øert all tho≈øe things to be ≈øpoken to him and written of him, by the Command of the Omnipotent God <hi>Jehova,</hi> who is not only Merciful, but is Ju≈øt al≈øo, without any additions? He an≈øwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>I do a≈ø≈øert ≈øo. Yea and I take it upon my Soul, that nothing has been added by me, and that nothing has been ≈øpoken by me, for any lucre ≈øake, or in favour, or hatred of any per≈øon.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="8">(8.) <hi>Proceeding further, we asked, Whether he would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it by ≈øuch an Oath as was pre≈øcribed? And again we exhorted him, not to act precipitantly, but to deliberate, yea and to take time for deliberation; that we would indulge him therein. He an≈øwered,</hi> There's no need of deliberation. And
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:40863:94"/>
ri≈øing up, and lifting up both his hands to Heaven, He thus ≈øpeak; I take upon my ≈øoul, whatever there is contained in the≈øe Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons written by me, has not at all been devi≈øed by me, nor any thing of mine own added; but only tho≈øe very things which the Lord the Doinator, has commanded to be written. And I firmly believe the Holy Ble≈ø≈øed Trinity will own all the≈øe for his, as for tho≈øe which are commanded to be written by the Eternal Wi≈ødom it ≈øelf.</p>

                           <hi>(9.) Entring forth therefore unto the Table, and taking the form of the Oath into his hand,</hi> he pronounced in order, clearly, di≈øtinctly all things (omitting nothing, rather here and there ≈øuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adding ≈øome things for more vehement a≈ø≈øeveration ≈øakes) with ≈øo great zeal, that all we pre≈øent ≈øeeing and hearing the≈øe things, ≈øtood a≈øtoni≈øhed. Some of us al≈øo trembled and wept. But in the very mid≈øt of the Oath he looked forth out of the Window <hi>(which was open)</hi> towards Heaven, crying out, Do you not ≈øee, friends, do you not ≈øee? <hi>But we asked not what he ≈øaw<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> (which in conference with Fr.</hi> Sam.

                           <hi>(10.)

                     <hi>I received yours full of Zeal, full of Lamentations, full of Interrogations, to which you require me, a worm, contemn'd of men, condemned, half put to death, to an≈øwer. Which after I had read over and weighed, I had re≈øolved to an≈øwer with ≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, &amp; to commend the matter to God the ≈øearcher of hearts, yet crying aloud,</hi> Come expo≈øtulate with me! But the Lord ≈øuffer'd me not to hold my peace, &amp;c. But as for me, I mu≈øt ≈øay with <hi>Jeremy,</hi> Wo unto me, my Mother, that thou bore≈øt me, whom all do cur≈øe! I be≈øprinkle the≈øe with tears, with <hi>Jeremy,</hi> ≈øaying, In truth the Lord hath commanded me, to write the≈øe things. Yet behold the word of the Lord is made unto me for a reproach, &amp;c. <hi>Is it not the voice of God which ≈øaith, The Lord doth not any thing, unle≈øs he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealeth his ≈øecret to his Servants. And by</hi> Joel, <hi>he promi≈øes that it ≈øhould come to pa≈øs in the la≈øt times,</hi> That their young men ≈øhould ≈øee Vi≈øions, and their old men dream dreams. <hi>And why as yet, ye illuminated men, I be≈øeech you, do you expect the la≈øt times? But becau≈øe the Lord hath ≈øaid unto me al≈øo</hi> (Jan. <hi>14. 1651.) a man of polluted lips,</hi> That I ≈øhould be his la≈øt Trumphet, Behold I, behold with full confidence and a≈ø≈øurance, in the ≈øight of God, Angels and men, do boldly ≈øpeak, that they are the words of God, which I have wrote.

But behold, as I live, or dye, that I have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten what I have heard from the Mouth of God, let men take it as they plea≈øe. <hi>To God be prai≈øe, that now the world ≈øhall no longer be ignorant of tho≈øe things, which the Lord would have denounced and declared by me unto it.</hi> Let who ≈øo will di≈øpute

again≈øt tho≈øe things, but not again≈øt me. For the Lord hath ≈øaid unto me, his worm, Thou art not of thus much, to defend thy ≈øelf, much le≈øs me, &amp; my words; I will defend my ≈øelf when I ≈øhall fulfil my words. The Sons of men under≈øtand not the hight of my Councels, as neither al≈øo th Angels, until they are fulfilled. I will fini≈øh what I have begun. Let who ≈øo will, be ≈øcandalized as he will. Let this be for thy comfort, that what thou ha≈øt wrote, thou ha≈øt heard of me, not from any one of men that are like unto thy ≈øelf. Be confident therefore with me my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Friend, that it will come to pa≈øs, that accu≈øers will grow mute when the hour of God comes. <hi>For the Word of the Lord will be an heavy burden to deriders. But for us, let us more fear God, who has power to kill Body and Soul; then mortal men who can do nothing, but what God permits them. That of yours,</hi> God forgive us the ha≈øty Edition of the Book, <hi>I thus change.</hi> Prai≈øe be unto God, who has vouch≈øafed us to free our Con≈øciences, in not hiding from the Sons of Men tho≈øe things, which the Mouth of God hath ≈øpoken.</p>
                  <p>Hereunto <hi>Comenius</hi> again, (from the increa≈øed taunts of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers) and filled with greater bitterne≈øs, retorted, If you, Friend, are ≈øo certain of Gods ≈øpeaking to you, that you are willing to ≈øeal it with your death, your certainty will ≈øerve for your ≈øelf, but not tho≈øe, whom the contrariety of events renders uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. And we ≈øee continual examples of ≈øuch as have embraced errors for truth, have been willing to lay down their lives for them, as for the very mo≈øt truth, being per≈øwaded nothing el≈øe in the ≈øight of God, then that they had believed, taught and wrought things mo≈øt true. And yet therefore did not Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror cea≈øe to be Error. You give firm belief to tho≈øe words ≈øpoke to you, <hi>Thou art that my la≈øt Trumpet.</hi> I but this perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually remains a que≈øtion, who≈øe voice that may be, &amp;c. Do you bid us put our hope in God? There is no where, where I can fix the Anchor of my Hope, but in him who knows the ≈øimplicity of my heart, that I have feigned nothing here; nor have added any thing to, nor taken from, nor changed tho≈øe
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:40863:96"/>
things, which were brought in the name of God. In the thing it ≈øelf if there be found error, the goodne≈øs of God will over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look the fault of humane frailty, committed by no manner of fraud, or de≈øign. And this ≈øhould be taken as a ≈øudden confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion in the ≈øight and pre≈øence of God, in≈øtead of a cha≈øti≈øment, more cautiou≈øly to lead our life. But if yet at length it ≈øhall appear to have been the work of God, even this my fluctuation mu≈øt nece≈ø≈øarily ≈øerve for the greater glory of God, and the comfort or in≈øtruction of the Godly; Although I, as <hi>Mo≈øes,</hi> ≈øhould ≈øuffer for it in this life. God only forbid that others, or even all our Church, ≈øhould nece≈ø≈øarily ≈øuffer ignominy and per≈øecution for us. Whereas you exhort to prai≈øe God, that notice of the≈øe things are given to the Sons of men, I know it is written, that al≈øo the fury of men mu≈øt at length prai≈øe God, and to that end, the wi≈øedom of God is illu≈øtrated by the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øhne≈øs of men. Yet the que≈øtion remains, what we are to do in the mean while. Some Friends here per≈øwade Silence.

I will expect your an≈øwer with unce≈ø≈øant ≈øighs and breathings to God. And indeed mo≈øt open heartedly, <hi>as at the Tribunal of God, whither I cite you to appear.</hi> Deal I ≈øay candidly with me, but even now at length, <hi>I adjure you by that tremendous Name, &amp; the ≈øalvation of your Soul, by not concealing that ≈øome of tho≈øe things which are ≈øo manife≈øtly fal≈øe, have been additaments of your own conjecture.</hi> This, if you ≈øhall do, the ≈øcandals in great part will cea≈øe. Becau≈øe we are admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhed that humane devi≈øings are fallacious. I know no more efficacious remedy; and it ≈øhall be, that God will judge you according to the Integrity of your heart, and being propitious to us all, brui≈øe Satan under our feet, although in our own ≈øhame and confu≈øion. May only the glory of Gods Truth ≈øtand un≈øhaken, and none of the Godly be made ≈øad by us or for us, much le≈øs the whole Church. <hi>I again, and again conjure you by</hi>

                     <hi>God and your own Soul, deal ≈øincerely with me, in this matter, now at length.</hi> The Holy good Spirit rule you. Farewel.</p>
                  <p>To ≈øo many obte≈øtations of his, <hi>Drabricius</hi> returned his conte≈øtations, more ≈øharply upbraiding the pu≈øillanimity of his Faith. And wrote down advi≈øe and coun≈øel, what he ≈øhould do, <hi>not in his own words, but of the very Oracle it ≈øelf.</hi> (Revelat. 460. afterwards.) And at length al≈øo <hi>a Preface,</hi> wherein, referring all things written by him to God alone, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired them to be printed, and made known to all Nations of the Earth, (as the la≈øt will of God.)</hi> Thereby taking all our fears upon him≈øelf wholly. <hi>The Preface, or Appeal to Gods Tribunal,</hi> goes before the Revelations.</p>
                  <p>And therefore ≈øeeing ≈øo great, learned and Godly a man, as <hi>Comenius,</hi> after ≈øo long deliberation, and con≈øultation with others, has thought it his duty to publi≈øh and dedicate them to all the world, let none think ami≈øs that they are thus ≈øum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily hinted in Engli≈øh; which very great u≈øe may be made of, however they prove, true, or fal≈øe.</p>
                  <p>And the more to confirm <hi>Comenius</hi> herein, was, that <hi>Drabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi> was not alone, but <hi>two other Prophets of God</hi> had gone before, all te≈øtifying the ≈øame things for the main ≈øub≈øtance and ≈øcope thereof.

about the time of deliverance drawing on, and with it, from. 1638, to 1664. (and ≈øome continuations ≈øince to 1668.) For an Argument that God never for≈øakes his.</p>

and ≈øometimes with her corporeal Eyes and Ears. To <hi>Drabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi> by Dreams, and by and by, by a lively Voice ≈øounding in his Ears. The two fir≈øt could remember to a word (before they were committed to writing) what they had ≈øeen and heard, if asked a thou≈øand times, not changing a very tittle. But <hi>Drabricius</hi> di≈øtru≈øting perpetually his own memory, was not able to write the things revealed, without the Lord repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, (and as it were dictating) unto him. Which we conjecture to be from hence, that their impre≈ø≈øions came by exta≈øies, their minds being wholly ab≈øtracted from ≈øen≈øe. But his ≈øen≈øes were left in their former ≈øtate, like to ours, &amp;c.

And in divers Vi≈øions he (as the other two al≈øo) were incouraged not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard what men ≈øaid or thought thereon at all, which he urged to the Lord as his trouble and impediment, as may be ≈øeen no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably in divers Revelations, which we will pa≈øs over with many other remarkable pa≈ø≈øages.</p>
                  <p>The chiefe≈øt enemy of <hi>Cotterus</hi> was one of the Emperial Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øurers of the Exchequer,, who ≈øwore he would not re≈øt till he ≈øaw him and another Mini≈øter hanged; He was at la≈øt taken and brought before him, examined and at length committed to Pri≈øon; All his writtings they could find ≈øea≈øed on and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined. At length he was brought forth to Tryal and was que≈øtioned, <hi>From whom he had the≈øe Fictions that he vented un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of Vi≈øions.</hi> But he con≈øtantly a≈ø≈øerted, <hi>from no mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Wight, but from tho≈øe ≈øpirits which were wont to appear to him, and again, di≈øappeared. Which whether they were good or evil Angels he, a ≈øimple Idiot, could not judge; but left it to the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and Wi≈øe to do.</hi> The Earle that ≈øeized on him inclined to di≈ømi≈øs him on certain conditions. But the Trea≈øurer refu≈øed and was more violent; And the other Mini≈øter que≈øtion'd for his life. That with his mo≈øt lying Pen abu≈øing the ≈øimplicity of a phanatick man, he had written Trea≈øon again≈øt the Emperor, who excu≈øed that what they had done was by the command of the Senate. But the Senate bailed their Pa≈øtor, under the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of two thou≈øand Gold Crowns to appear; but <hi>Cotterus,</hi> the Trea≈øurer committed to clo≈øer pri≈øon, till he was almo≈øt fami≈øhed. An entire volumn of his Vi≈øions was by his enemyes brought to the Earl, who when he had read them, would no more meddle in the bu≈øine≈øs, and procured that <hi>Cotterus</hi> ≈øhould have coun≈øel to defend him≈øelf. The definitive Sentence was not known; for the Trea≈øurer being newly Marryed to a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Lady, upon ≈øome occa≈øions went a journey, and in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:40863:100"/>
was ≈øuddenly taken with vehement gripings of the belly, one evening in the very Suburbs of <hi>Sprottavia</hi> (where he threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened to ≈øee him hanged with the Mini≈øter) and po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed with I know not what fear, would take nothing pre≈øcribed by the Phy≈øitians that was called; But would defer it till next day, that his di≈øea≈øe might better di≈øcover it ≈øelf; <hi>but dyed ≈øuddenly in the night,</hi> There, where he had purpo≈øed to hang tho≈øe Saints of God; which rai≈øed a terror in all the City, &amp;c. So that his Enemyes being hereby terrified, dur≈øt not publi≈øh the Sentence again≈øt him, but u≈øed him better in pri≈øon, and with more freedom to him≈øelf, and acce≈øs of his Wife and Friends; who urged his di≈ømi≈ø≈øion or execution; ≈øo that his adver≈øaries be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing never at re≈øt, after ≈øome months deliberation, brought him forth out of pri≈øon, ≈øet him in the Pillory, in the Market place bound him in an Iron Collor, and a paper affixed on his head, <hi>This is the fal≈øe prophet who hath foretold tho≈øe things which are not come to pa≈øs:</hi> And ≈øo was ≈øent away out of the City, by the common Executinor<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and Bani≈øhed, and lived ≈øo twenty years, &amp;c.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Cotterus</hi> al≈øo had a Miraculous Cure and Recovery from an Epidemical Di≈øtemper, which had ≈øeized on him, (with his Wife, Daughter, and another of the hou≈øe, ≈øo that they all lay down of it; At which time his Wife al≈øo ≈øaw one of the Spirits enter the Room one evening.

                  <p>The Spirit wi≈øhing health to him, asked him how he did. As a poor mi≈øerable man can be, ≈øaid he, whom the Lord hath vi≈øited. The Spirit then ≈øaid, Be of good chear, God will rai≈øe thee up. Cut thee three mor≈øels of Bread, Eat, and take three ≈øpoonfuls of Ale, the di≈øea≈øe will leave thee. He did ≈øo, and

was rap't into an Exta≈øie and had Vi≈øions, &amp;c. And after retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to him≈øelf, was wholly well.</p>
                  <p>We mu≈øt al≈øo pa≈øs over the innumerable wonderful things, that in particular concern <hi>Chri≈øtina</hi> likewi≈øe, &amp; her Exta≈øies and Vi≈øions, &amp;c.

In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable pains, torments and di≈øquietments on a ≈øudden, and in a moment delivered in an Exta≈øie. (6.) Horrible and de≈øperate temptations of the Devil, overcome &amp; vanqui≈øh'd wonderfully, by the Divine Power and Pre≈øence with her in her Vi≈øions or Exta≈øies in more then an ordinary manner. (7.) Something inflicted by Gods immediate hand in a Vi≈øion, to remain all the dayes of her life to humble her; but ≈øhe di≈øcovered not what it was. (8.) Her <hi>wonderful Death</hi> and indeed <hi>Re≈øurrection,</hi> as we may ≈øay. All which <hi>her Tutour Comenius</hi> was an Eye witne≈øs of.

Of God, <hi>To believe in Hope again≈øt Hope;</hi> and not pa≈øs ra≈øh judgement through un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief on Divine predictions, though they never appear to our apprehen≈øion, &amp;c. <hi>for Gods thoughts are not as our thoughts,</hi> &amp;c. Again, all things were not evidently fulfilled to appearance, to the Ancient Prophets. Therefore deriders ≈øaid, <hi>Where is the Word of the Lord, let it come,</hi> &amp;c. Jer. 17. 15. But God does not want cau≈øes, to defer his promi≈øes, or threatnings, or to change them, and has been plea≈øed to render rea≈øons. <hi>Jona</hi> 4. <hi>Jer.</hi> 18. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 89. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 30.

And all is attributed either only to natural cau≈øes, or chance, or vain imagination, and nothing to God. Which God grievou≈øly complains of, <hi>Amos</hi> 4. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. This is the la≈øt ≈øecurity of the World, that Faith will not be found on Earth, &amp;c. And as in the dayes of <hi>Noah</hi> (when all were ≈øo ≈øecure) ≈øo it ≈øhall be in the la≈øt dayes, all things ≈øhall be full of Prodigies in Heaven, and Earth, of Bloud, Fire, and Smoke; of Dreams, Vi≈øions, and Prophe≈øies. <hi>Joel</hi> 2. 28. &amp;c. <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.

And for men, they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the wit of man; e≈øpecially of the≈øe men. <hi>Kotterus,</hi> an <hi>Artizan,</hi> and mo≈øt ≈øimple Ideot. <hi>Chri≈øtina,</hi> a young Virgin, by her Age uncapable of ≈øuch things. <hi>Drabricius,</hi> an old doting Man; (as his Enemies traduce him;) <hi>Do they not then ≈øpeak things more then humane?</hi> (Therefore being neither Humane nor Diabolical, they mu≈øt certainly be Divine.) But I cea≈øe to contend with Arguments, whether the≈øe things be Divine, and not Humane, committing it to every mans own Con≈øcience and circum≈øpection, and the divine Illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For as none can convince by Arguments, whether it be Day or Ninght, except the Sun be ri≈øen, to cau≈øe day, and men open their eyes: So none can better demon≈øtrate, that God ≈øpeaks, then God him≈øelf ≈øpeaking, and man attending to God; and that the Voice of God be ≈øealed al≈øo with Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent Effects. That the very things may ≈øpeak for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves, and their Author. (By the light only we ≈øee the Light, and things done by day, &amp;c.)</p>
                  <p>Wilt thou know therefore, O Man! <hi>whether God ≈øpeaks here? three things are to be done.</hi> (1.) To Pray, Lord! open mine eyes, that I may ≈øee whether it be thou that ≈øpeake≈øt, or a Spirit of Delu≈øion. (2.) To hearken to the Voice of him that
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:40863:125"/>
≈øpeaks. That is to know and examine all things in order, and not be ignorant of the particulars, and all circum≈øtances. (3.) To look about circum≈øpectly, whether any ≈øuch things be now a doing in the World or no, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>If for all this any one likes not <hi>to read this Book,</hi> let him do as he likes be≈øt. Let him turn away his eyes, ≈øtop his cars, harden his heart, &amp;c. And if he will, <hi>add furies al≈øo, let him rear the Book in pieces, cut it, burn it,</hi> as <hi>Joakim</hi> did, <hi>Jer.</hi> 36. Or fall on Gods Witne≈ø≈øes, as on <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> or <hi>Baruch,</hi> or <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> &amp;c. But who≈øoever thou art, that art wi≈øe, take heed of Precipices. <hi>'Tis dangerous to meddle with Prophetick Matters. 'Tis mo≈øt ≈øafe coun≈øel to ab≈øtain from the≈øe men.</hi>‚ÄîSpecially the Per≈øons that undergoe and tell ≈øuch Dreams, Raptures, Apparitions, being otherwi≈øe innocent and harmle≈øs. Rather ≈øay as the <hi>Phari≈øees</hi> of <hi>Paul, We have found no evil in this man: But if a Spirit have ≈øpoken unto him, or an Angel, let us not fight again≈øt God.</hi> He wages War with God, who by force ≈øeeks to oppre≈øs the Spirit of Prophe≈øie. But if by no obte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtations we can obtain moderation with men, I humbly throw my ≈øelf pro≈øtrate with this whole Cau≈øe at thy feet, Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øus! who art con≈øtituted Judge of quick and dead; di≈øtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui≈øh betwixt, and pronounce with thy true Mouth, for the Truth, again≈øt a lie!‚Äî</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But there are ≈øo many frauds and cheats in the World, will ≈øome ≈øay; But however the Apo≈øtle bids,</hi> De≈øpi≈øe not Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øie. Try the Spirits whether they be of God or no. Try all things, hold fa≈øt that which is Good.‚Äî</p>
                  <p>We will but add la≈øtly, (having gone ≈øo far already, beyond our intent at the fir≈øt, in the≈øe Apologetick Di≈øcour≈øes and Collections) the mo≈øt weighty pa≈ø≈øages, out of their ≈øolemn Prayer, and appeal to Chri≈øt, in that publick form, made for the tryal of <hi>Drabicius,</hi> by the <hi>forecited dreadful Oath;</hi> All for the further evidence and confirmation of the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, with the candid and ingenuous Reader; and to give the

                  <p>‚ÄîWe know the impudence of that Enemy, who is ≈øo bold as to mix him≈øelf with thy Sons, and to counterfeit an Angel of Light, when he is but the Prince of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs; and to offer him≈øelf to be a Leader and Coun≈øellor to men, when he is the wor≈øt and vile≈øt Betrayer, and ≈øo to colour over his Prophets and Apo≈øtles, as to appear thy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apo≈øtles.

fal≈øe Prophe≈øies, as we fear, or fal≈øe Lights, to di≈øcern whether truly Divine, and from thee.‚Äî<hi>But thou, O Lord! with whom is light, and who alone ≈øee≈øt all things, and alone knowe≈øt to di≈øtingui≈øh Error from Truth; Why hold hold'≈øt thou thy peace at the≈øe things?

                  </p>
                  <p>O Lord, the Dominator! If any Crafts-ma≈øter and Contriver of Cheats, have befooled any one among≈øt us, ≈øo as to reckon his ≈øad trifling Songs, or mournful Ditties, for true Revelations Divine, and to vent them to others, deceiving, and being decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; Succour him! ≈øuccour the re≈øt of us! <hi>that we may be as thy Mouth, ≈øeparating the precious from the vile. But now,</hi> if any one of us, willingly and knowingly, give up him≈øelf, as an In≈øtrument to Satan, and in thy Name, exerci≈øes impo≈øtures; Lord! make it manife≈øt; and ≈øet forth ≈øuch a Me≈ø≈øenger of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan for an Example to the World. <hi>Thou ≈øpared≈øt not the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels that proudly ≈øinned; neither ≈øpare the≈øe who imitating Satanical pride, draw away them≈øelves, and others, into Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipices of de≈øtruction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the other ≈øide, for≈øake not thy holy <hi>Jeremiahs,</hi> or <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chea's,</hi> that are brui≈øed with a petulant Tongue or Hand; or thru≈øt into Pri≈øon: But all <hi>Pa≈øchurs,</hi> their Smiters, fill with fear on every ≈øide, every where, that their eyes may ≈øee the truth of thy Words.‚Äî</p>
                  <p>And indeed accordingly, God begins to ≈øpeak for him≈øelf, (≈øo that there is no need for man to ≈øpeak for him more.) <hi>But where, and how?</hi> Fir≈øt, in the very <hi>Act of</hi> Drabricius<hi>'s Oath.</hi>
                     <pb n="147" facs="tcp:40863:126"/>
For there was this <hi>Dilemma. If I have not ≈øpoken thy Words, O God! ≈ømite me in pieoes in the ≈øight of all.</hi> If thine; ≈øhew, that they are thine, by fulfilling their truth. But behold! he doth not yet ≈øinite him; (but ≈øuffer him to live very old) and on the contrary hath ≈ømote ≈øeveral of his Adver≈øaries with death, according to the threatnings of God by him; and particularly one of the Pa≈øtors, a new one, among tho≈øe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iles, who became a new Adver≈øary to him. Therefore he gives te≈øtimony, that they are not others words. Secondly, In the Events them≈øelves, much fulfilled, or daily fulfilling, &amp;c. Therefore what need of more words? &amp;c. But to leave all to God, who alwayes accompli≈øhes his words, fir≈øt, or la≈øt, in his own time, and his own way.</p>
                  <p>And thus we have at length brought a long-boding pream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to an end; which hath exceeded indeed the bounds due to this place: But being in, we knew not how to give of, nor forbear ≈øuch material pa≈ø≈øages, for the gaining greater cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to the en≈øuing Relations; and which was almo≈øt ab≈øolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nece≈ø≈øary, to prevent prejudice and offence again≈øt things of ≈øo ≈øtrange a nature; That ≈øo the Courteous Reader might the better take in good part the Hi≈øtory, what ever heed he give to the Prophe≈øie.</p>
                  <p>For we divine full well, that mo≈øt will but look upon them, as the Dreams or Ravings of two old doting Seniors, now going down with their gray Hairs in ≈øorrow to the grave. But be they of God, Man, or the Devil, they are the ≈øtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt things that ever yet appeared on the Stage of the World. And for that end only we relate them here, as ob≈øervable Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtory, and matter of Fact; and thereby, if they prove true, the future State of <hi>Europe.</hi> And have further thought fit to repre≈øent the chief and mo≈øt material Things, that <hi>Comenius</hi> has recorded in behalf of their Truth and Verity, or wrote by way of Apology for them. Which having done, we leave it to Time and Providence, to di≈øcover and prove them,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:40863:127"/>
either Verities or Delu≈øions; But however, whether one or the other, mo≈øt Remarkable. And yet one would think mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of years ≈øhould teach wi≈ødom, and make the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced pa≈øt all ≈øuch dotages. <hi>Comenius</hi> is aged, learned, ≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and godly, known of all men; <hi>hath had above forty years knowledge and tryal of the≈øe matters,</hi> as has been ≈øaid before; And has ob≈øerved and delivered <hi>more convincing Arguments for their Divinity, than any has, or can, again≈øt them.</hi> Has had the Te≈øtimony of the mo≈øt illuminated Divines of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtendom. Has found none to convince or condemn them of Impo≈øture, upon <hi>fair tryal and examination; which mo≈øt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øonable reque≈øt, is all that is de≈øired in the face of all the Chri≈øtian World, and ought not in ju≈øtice be denyed them;</hi> Till which let all men be ≈øilent before God. For 'tis better to ≈øu≈øpend Judgment, than pa≈øs it ra≈øhly. None of the≈øe things have been done clande≈øtinely, or managed incon≈øiderately. <hi>They ≈øtand ready for the Bar of Mans Tribunal; and in the mean while appeal to God.</hi> If they mu≈øt needs be reproached for the≈øe things, ≈øayes <hi>Comenius,</hi> and that Chri≈øtian People will ≈øin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt God and their own Souls; for their parts, they will like <hi>Jeremy, appeal to God and Men.</hi> Fir≈øt, And above all things, <hi>to God, the Supream Witne≈øs, Judge and Avenger of this Cau≈øe; and then to tho≈øe who are in the place of God on Earth;</hi> both Governors of States, and Churches too, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to plead this Cau≈øe before them.‚Äî</p>
                  <p>Now if they be of Man, or the Devil, none ought to fear them, but contemn them. And therefore none ≈øhould be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended that they are thus brought to light, and into Engli≈øh. For we intend them here, only as a mo≈øt wonderful Hi≈øtory of the pre≈øent Age, not to be pa≈ø≈øed over without taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of. For, be they true, be they fal≈øe, they will be found exceeding u≈øeful to the Age, and to Po≈øterity.</p>

                     <head>The fir≈øt Relation of <hi>Kotter</hi> before the Senate, of Angelical Revelations, had by him for three years before, in the year, <hi>1616.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>ON the 29<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Augu≈øt,</hi> 1619. <hi>Chri≈øtopher Kotter</hi> appeared before the Senate of the City <hi>Sprottavia,</hi> who were the Magi≈øtrates there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and having crav'd and obtain'd liberty to ≈øpeak, thus began. That he acknowledged that he ≈øtood before them, to whom he was bound, <hi>by the Holy Law of an Oath,</hi> to ≈øpeak nothing but Truth. And that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the pre≈øent peculiar cau≈øe, for which he appeared, he would in good faith relate nothing el≈øe, but what in very deed and in truth hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to him, and is wont ≈øtill to happen. He therefore declared, that on <hi>June</hi> 11. 1616. it hapned, that going to <hi>Gorlitz,</hi> he lodged at <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hammer;</hi> whence the next morning being gone on his way, and pa≈øt <hi>Gorlitz Wood,</hi> and entred into an open plain, intending for <hi>Langenovia,</hi> his birth-place, There approached a certain man on one ≈øide of him, of a mo≈øt comely feature, in Mourning Apparel, and black Boots; whom he ≈øu≈øpected to be ≈øome <hi>Mine-man,</hi> becau≈øe the Neighbourhood abounded with Iron Mines; but he drew nearer, and lovingly ≈øaluted <hi>Chri≈øtopher;</hi> inquiring, Whither he was going? And that returning his ≈øalutations, he an≈øwered to his inquiries; And that while, by this means, they came at length to familiar Speeches, and had proceeded almo≈øt four Miles in company together on their way, di≈øcour≈øing with one another, it fell out that entring into ≈øome narrow pa≈ø≈øages of the Road, this Companion addre≈ø≈øing him≈øelf more roughly to <hi>Chri≈øtopher</hi> then he had u≈øed, cries out, <hi>Ho! Thou man! I have ≈øomething to tell thee which thou mu≈øt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to the Magi≈øtrates Eccle≈øia≈øticks and Saecular. Chri≈øtopher</hi> amazed at the≈øe things, and not knowing what ≈øhould be the matter, the other went on, <hi>That the Wrath of God is kindled again≈øt Man-kind, and it ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtens to inflict puni≈øhments in fury, except they repent. To puni≈øh e≈øpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally that pride, impurity, and contempt of God, and of the Divine Word.</hi> When he had ≈øaid the≈øe things, they were come to the Medow of <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chior Frank;</hi> where, becau≈øe a Ditch was to be pa≈ø≈øed, <hi>Chri≈øtopher</hi> going over the little Bridg fir≈øt, the other behind his back, vani≈øhed he knew not whither, and ≈øo went on alone to <hi>Langenovia;</hi> but from thence,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:40863:134"/>
after he had tarried a night with his Mother, to <hi>Gorlitz,</hi> to his <hi>quondam</hi> Ma≈øter in his Craft. And on the 14<hi>th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> entring the Temple, heard a Sermon: and that when his thoughts di≈øturbed ≈øo, from this late con≈øternation, could not be quiet; for his mind ≈øake, he went even to the Chappel, which they call <hi>Chri≈øts Sepulchre.</hi> That there, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon beheld lately, again appeared unto him, and repeating the ≈øame words, di≈øappeared. That the next day following, after Prayers in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and Sermon heard, returning into the Suburbs, the ≈øelf ≈øame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon returned, accompanying him, and reiterating what he had before ≈øaid, vani≈øhed. That after this, going to <hi>Langenovia,</hi> he remained a whole week with his Mother, lame of his feet, and mole≈øted with many di≈øquietments of mind. But that when after he was returning back again to his bu≈øine≈øs, to the City, that per≈øon met him in his Fathers Field, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calling tho≈øe former things to his memory. That thence betaking him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf homewards, and lodging at <hi>Sagan,</hi> as he went to Church in the morning, the ≈øame Man met him again in the ≈øtreet, in the ≈øame feature, yet not in mourning habit now, but of a Jacynth colour. That he therefore, after Sermon, <hi>went to the chief Pa≈øtor of the Church,</hi> M. Mei≈øner, <hi>and related the Matter,</hi> as it had hapned, and de≈øired advice. Who gave him this, That continuing fervent prayers to God, he would, for a little while longer, ≈øuppre≈øs this thing in ≈øilence, and as much as he could, ≈øhake tho≈øe things out of his mind; mindful of that, <hi>They have</hi> Mo≈øes <hi>and the Prophets, let them hear them.</hi> Yet adding, that he would not be wanting to his duty to exhort men to Repentance; and that, that Vi≈øion, if it came from God, as Author, would return again. That <hi>Chri≈øtopher</hi> therefore, obtaining this an≈øwer, went away, and going his way home, makes his Kin≈øman, (whom he had turn'd a little out of the way in his Journey to ≈øee) and (when at home) his Wife al≈øo, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcious to the whole matter. Being yet admoni≈øhed on all hands, to hold his peace, le≈øt the fame thereof being carried to the Magi≈øtrates or the Mini≈øters, he might run ≈øome danger. And from that time, that he never made any one acquainted with it; yet perpetually di≈øquieted in his own Con≈øcience; till on the 14<hi>th</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> 1619. The ≈øame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon cloathed in Jacynth habit, appeared unto him again. At which ≈øight, he was now, not only not afrighted, but filled through and through with a certain intimate and unwonted joy. But <hi>being asked</hi> (after fir≈øt ≈øaluting of him) <hi>whether he had taken care of the things he had commanded him;</hi> and when, not knowing what to an≈øwer, he ≈øtood mute, That that man, with eyes lifted up to Heaven, ≈øaid, <hi>Not unto us, not unto us, O Lord! but unto thy Name give Glory!</hi> And turning
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:40863:135"/>
to <hi>Chri≈øtopher,</hi> ≈øaid on, <hi>But why did you neglect to perform that?</hi> Or has not thy God de≈øerved a greater thing than this at thy hands? Who hath Created, Redeemed, Sanctified, and Regenerated thee to the hope of eternal Life? Behold! thy God hath delivered up his Son to death for thy ≈øake! and do≈øt thou refu≈øe to lend him thy Tongue? and to yeeld thy ≈øelf an In≈øtrument of his Work? <hi>I declare plainly unto thee, except thou ≈øhalt do this thing, that thou ≈øhalt not have quiet in thine heart. Nor this only, but thy Name al≈øo ≈øhall be blotted out of the Book of Life.</hi> Why do≈øt thou fear men that are lighter then the Leaves of the Trees, making a noi≈øe? Who indeed ≈øhall pa≈øs this three-fold Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Cen≈øure upon the≈øe things? <hi>Some ≈øhall threaten thee, others ≈øhall wonder, mo≈øt ≈øhall ≈ølight.</hi> But thou, take heed thou regard none of the≈øe things! Then the Spirit began to inform him, That the face of the pre≈øent times, was partly joyful, partly ≈øorrowful. Joyful, for that they were times of Grace, in which the Light of the Divine Word hath ≈øhined in ≈øuch clear brightne≈øs unto men; ≈øorrowful, for that men would not ≈øee this Light, but keept their hearts darkned with Errors and infidelity. That the≈øe things were more at large explained by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, but that all things were not retained in his memory. At length that the Spirit ≈øaid, Unle≈øs men ≈øhall go about ≈øeriou≈øly, and in good earne≈øt to amend them≈øelves, <hi>That God was about to puni≈øh them grievou≈øly with Sword, Famine, and Pe≈øtilence.</hi> And reaching forth his right hand to <hi>Chri≈øtopher,</hi> warned him further, to put off all fear. That no hurt ≈øhould be≈øal him; and la≈øtly added thereto, <hi>I will ha≈øten my Word to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compli≈øh it.</hi> And that the≈øe things ≈øaid, he di≈øappeared. But that he was left there alone, amazed at fir≈øt, then ca≈øting his eyes round about, on all parts, he ≈øaw, on one ≈øide, a white company of them that ≈øung and tryumphed; but on the other, a black company of them that wailed and howled; and that being a≈øtoni≈øhed with the Vi≈øion, he returned home.</p>

                                 <p>At length I opened anew, and found <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. of the Book of <hi>Wi≈ødom,</hi> where it is ≈øaid, That Wi≈ødom enters not into a malitious Soul: And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Spirit of Wi≈ødom be a kind and loving Spirit, yet it acquits not a Bla≈øphemer of his Lips, becau≈øe God is Witne≈øs of his Reins, and a true Searcher of his Heart, and Hearer of his Tongue.

We'll conclude onely with a wi≈øe and ≈øober Remarque, out of the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtery of Je≈øuiti≈øm, concerning the Prophecies of St. <hi>Hildegard;</hi> which very well agrees, and may very well be applied to the≈øe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>‚ÄîThus far <hi>(≈øays he)</hi> the Prophecy it ≈øelf: Of which, and the like, what to think, and what credit is to be given thereto, others have given their opinion, <hi>viz.</hi> That 'tis not impo≈ø≈øible, Prophecies and Predictions of this kind, may amount to no more, than the Dreams of melancholy, ≈øuper≈øtitious, and di≈øtempered Per≈øons: Such as of which, it may be ≈øaid;
<q>
                              <l>Augurium vanum, vani docuere Parentes;</l>
                              <l>Cui credens dignus decipiatur erit.</l>

                           </q>
But to deny all credit to Prophecies, is to be guilty of an incredulity, greater than that of the incredulous Thomas. Nor are we to think what God ≈øaith by the Prophet Joel, to be ≈øpoken in vain; That in the la≈øt days the old men ≈øhould dream Dreams, and ≈øee Vi≈øions; and the Sons and Daughters pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe≈øie. Many Examples might be alledged of Prophecies of this kind; which the Events have confirm'd to be true; and therefore they may challenge Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, when they are in their Effects fulfilled. </q>

            <p>But by the way, Had the ≈øame mea≈øure been meted to the Je≈øuites there, by Heathens, as they mete to fellow Chri≈øtians here; or as we ≈øay, had they ≈øerv'd them in the ≈øame ≈øauce, they might have had indeed a few Martyrs and Confe≈ø≈øors per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps; but never Evangeli≈øts and Preachers, or Apo≈øtles of the <hi>Chinois,</hi> unle≈øs at Stake only.</p>

               <head>A Compendium of the Divine Law.</head>
               <p n="1">1. Perhaps ≈øome one may ask what God is? 'Tis an≈øwered, God is no other thing, then the Creator of all things; as al≈øo the great Governor and Lord of all things, who made the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, who made the Earth, who made Spirits, who made Men.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Heavens, Earth, Men, and all things before were nothing, and afterwards were. Therefore before the Heavens, Earth, Men, and all things, there was ≈øome Lord nece≈ø≈øarily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to create them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becau≈øe all things cannot be made of them≈øelves; all have that from out of which they are made, or a Maker of them; as Towers, Palaces, and Hou≈øes cannot be made of them≈øelves, but mu≈øt nece≈ø≈øarily be the work of ≈øome Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Therefore the Heavens, Earth, Men and Creatures, how can they be created of them≈øelves? There is therefore an Author of the≈øe things, whom we name God. If men do name an Age <hi>Puencu,</hi> and make others like them≈øelves, and a fir≈øt Grand-father. (Parent.)</p>
               <p n="5">5. Then the≈øe al≈øo were, after the Heavens and the Earth were. All had a Father and a Mother, from whom they were procreated. And of the≈øe, to make a Creator of Heaven and Earth, of Men and of Things, is a great Error.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Some will ≈øay, The Heavens, Earth, Men, and Things, ≈øeeing they depend on God in their Creation; I am bold to ask, This God, of whom does he depend in his Creation?</p>
               <p n="7">7. 'Tis an≈øwer'd, God is the fir≈øt Root and Principle of Things; If he had dependence in his Creation, for that very thing he would not be God.</p>
               <p n="8">8. For things either have a beginning and end; as Herbs, Trees, Fowls, and creeping things; or they have a beginning and no end, as Heaven, Earth, Angels, Devils, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellective
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40863:149"/>
≈øouls of Men; God only is without beginning and end, and can give a beginning and end to all things.</p>
               <p n="9">9. If there was not God, there would not be other created things. As for Example, Of one Tree, the Flowers, Fruits, Boughs, Leaves, and Body, are all generated out of the Root. If there be not the Root, for that very thing the re≈øt will not be. But</p>
               <p n="10">10. Coming to the Root of the Tree, by no means is there another Root, out of which to be ≈øprung or proceed. God, ≈øeeing he is the Root and Foundation of all things, out of what other thing can him≈øelf proceed?</p>
               <p n="11">11. God, when he fir≈øt created all things, in the beginning, he divided the Heavens from the Earth, created all ≈øpecies (or kinds) of things: Afterwards he created Male and Female; the Male was call'd <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12. The Woman was call'd <hi>Eve.</hi> For the≈øe two had not Father and Mother, and are the fir≈øt Parents of all People; All el≈øe (as <hi>Fo Ki,</hi> not excepting tho≈øe whom they make Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal.) All have</p>
               <p n="13">13. A Father and a Mother of whom they are born; and they could not avoid it, but that ≈øooner or later they ≈øhould be corrupted and die. God, ≈øeeing he is the true Lord of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, Earth, Men, and Things, &amp;c. together withal created all things,</p>
               <p n="14">14. That they ≈øhould be for mens u≈øe. Con≈øequently it altogether behoves us Men to love and wor≈øhip God. By not loving and wor≈øhipping, great ≈øin is thereupon committed. For example, A couple of Parents produce a Son.</p>
               <p n="15">15. They nouri≈øh, cloath, educate him. If the Son know not to honour Father and Mother, certainly he is called di≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient, and mo≈øt grievou≈øly ≈øins. How much more,</p>
               <p n="16">16. Seeing God is the chief Parent of Men, does it not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hove us to love and reverence him, ≈øince it is now declar'd, what God, the Lord of all things is? It is ea≈øie to explain the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40863:149"/>
the things of this Age, (or World, that is of Mankind.)</p>

                     <hi>I Achilleus</hi> weigh with my ≈øelf, that being by Office, Keeper of the Privy Chambers of the Emperor, yet led by error, I al≈øo take care of the Militia. Whence I have dimini≈øhed (that is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded or deba≈øed) my ≈øelf; and without light, and Di≈øcipline (that is, In≈øtruction) have augmented the multitude of ≈øins. Long ≈øince in the Northern Court or Palace, through the good Will of God, I hapned upon men of the Society of Je≈øus, who led me, who was rude and ignorant, in the open Path, exhorting me, erring and going a≈øtray, to follow the Faith. Wherefore, being with reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence expiated in <hi>the Holy Laver,</hi> I then began to under≈øtand the documents (that is Fundamentals, or Principles) of the Holy Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and its hidden Excellency, and high profundity. And then being immers'd in this ≈øtudy night and day, with a faithful heart, I have pro≈øecuted it twenty years and more; nor dur≈øt I grow ≈ølack in the lea≈øt. So I have procured the help of the King of Heaven, whom I know not how I ≈øhall be able to an≈øwer. I had often a mind to come unto your <hi>mo≈øt Holy Throne,</hi> and with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration to ≈øatisfie my eyes with your <hi>mo≈øt Holy Countenance;</hi>
                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:40863:155"/>
But the matters of the Empire were ≈øo various, and the Royal Affairs ≈øo perplexed, as they were; permitted me not to perform the de≈øires of my intimate Bo≈øome. Wherefore I am mo≈øt highly ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grieved. The onely thought (and grief) now, of me a Sinner, from the bottom of my Soul, is in this, that the calamity of the Empire has not yet cea≈øed. Therefore on purpo≈øe I went and asked a man of the Society of Je≈øus, Father <hi>Michael Boym,</hi> that in the next Ship that went away, he would return back to the great We≈øt, and come ≈øuppliant to you, <hi>the chief Prie≈øt, the mo≈øt Holy Father,</hi> that before the Altar of the Saints, <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> with the univer≈øal Church of the whole World, with eyes lifted up to Heaven, you would pray to God, that he would look down upon this Imperial Hou≈øe; with mercy help, and con≈øerve the Empire and ≈øet limits of future ≈øpeedy peace; and together would grant, that our mo≈øt wi≈øe Emperor, who is the eighteenth Succe≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øor of this Royal Hou≈øe, and the twelfth Grand-child from the fir≈øt founder of the Empire and Family; That him≈øelf (as Lord) with his Subjects, may adore Je≈øus the Lord of the Heavens. This at length will be the intire happine≈øs of our <hi>China</hi> Empire. And indeed at pre≈øent, the mo≈øt intire, mo≈øt wi≈øe, mo≈øt clement, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable Empre≈øs, of Chri≈øtian Name, <hi>Helena;</hi> The Queen Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Emperor, of Chri≈øtian name, <hi>Mary;</hi> The Queen his legitimate Wife<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> of Chri≈øtian name <hi>Anna;</hi> and the Son of the Emperor, Prince and Heir, by Chri≈øtian Name, <hi>Con≈øtantine,</hi> do all with humble hearts believe and wor≈øhip the Holy Doctrine; together they have the words of Speech, which they ≈øend to the <hi>mo≈øt Holy Throne. (viz.</hi> of the Pope) As for me rude Sinner, I humbly be≈øeech you the <hi>mo≈øt Holy Father,</hi> That for the hour of my departure out of this life, you would vouch≈øafe <hi>intire remi≈ø≈øion of the puni≈øhment of ≈øins,</hi> and would ≈øend al≈øo many men of the Society, into this Empire of <hi>China,</hi> who by their Doctrine may convert univer≈øally the men of the Age, and may adverti≈øe them, with Repentance to give good heed to Wor≈øhip, and adore the Holy Law; nor may by a vain and tran≈øient ≈øtay, be ≈øent away with

the Du≈øt of their Feet ≈ønatch'd up, (that is, quickly.) So at length I hope to attain Felicity truly never to have an end. With Veneration, I have in ≈ømall mea≈øure, by the≈øe things, explained the Secrets of a ≈øimple ignorant Mind.

Hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I onely knew the ob≈øervance of the Privy-Chambers. I was ignorant of the Law of Forreign Lands. It happened that a Man of the Society of Je≈øus, Father <hi>Andrew Xavier,</hi> did ≈øtay in our Court, (or Pallace) promulging the holy Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. By relation of others, I began to know him. And behold!

Therefore I am fru≈øtrate of my De≈øire. In the mean while, with profound bowing, even to the Ground, We be≈øeech You the <hi>Mo≈øt Holy Father,</hi> That You would be led before the Pre≈øence of the Divine Maje≈øty, and out of Pious Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on toward Us, who are obnoxious to Sins; and at the hour of Our departure out of this World, You would vouch≈øafe to <hi>Indulge to Us intire remi≈ø≈øion of the puni≈øhment of Sins.</hi> With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, we be≈øeech You, the <hi>Mo≈øt Holy Father,</hi> that with the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Univer≈øal Church, You would deprecate the Supreme Lord for Us, That He would confirm Our Empire; help and e≈øtabli≈øh it (being once re≈øtored) with Peace; and withall
