         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THis little Piece of Hiſtory has ſtuck in the Birth well nigh a whole year; and at laſt is forced to come forth an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Embryo, through the unhappy Midwifry of the Preſs.</p>
            <p>Yet for thy encouragement, thou oughteſt to know, That there is none ſuch ever yet extant in the Engliſh Tongue. For, for the firſt Part; there is, <hi>(1.)</hi> Not a more modern and later Hiſtory of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom</hi> in Engliſh; Nor <hi>(2.)</hi> a better in ſo ſmall a Volumn: <hi>viz.</hi> None that gives a better account of the laſt fore-going, and this preſent Age, (which two chiefly concern us to know) that is, of the laſt conſiderable Affairs of the World, and preſent ſtate of things. We ſay, there is none extant, of the like nature, ſo ſhort and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive.</p>
            <p>And for the Second Part, It is the moſt wonderful ſtrangeſt Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory ever yet known in the World, in the Engliſh, yea, or any other Language. And indeed, not to be parallel'd by all Hiſtory and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity. Whether thoſe Prophetical Revelations be from GOD, Man, or the Devil; yet they exceed all compariſon. If they be from GOD, they are the ſtrangeſt and moſt miraculous, ever ſince the Apoſtles days. If they be Deluſions and Imaginations of Man, they are the ſtrangeſt ever ſuffer'd, or invented by Man. If laſtly, Devices, Faſcinations, and Bewitchings of the Devil, (transform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf into an Angel of Light, &amp;c.) they are the ſtrangeſt ſtill; and the leaſt Footſteps of his Cloven Foot to be diſcerned, that ever was in any of his Juggles. Onely we have been unhappily hindred by the Preſs, from giving you a ſhort view and taſte of the Prophecies themſelves, as was really intended.</p>

And theſe two things may perhaps help to make it go down with the Reader, as it is, notwithſtanding all its faults. For 'tis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd, there are many Defects, procur'd through manyfold Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, not fit here to be mentioned. And if, Worthy Reader, thou kneweſt all Circumſtances, thou wouldſt certainly be ſo candid, as to pardon all Faults: Which I doubt not but thou wilt (at leaſt) for the good will and Endeavours of the Author.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Europe</hi> compar'd with other Parts, and former Times, for Arms, Arts, Commerce, and Religion. The preheminence of Empire and Arms. The preheminence of Arts and Sciences.

The Jeſuites Inſcription thereon. The preheminence as to former times, in many rare Arts and Inventions. The prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence of Riches and Commerce, Shipping and Navigation. The preheminence of Religion, or Priviledge of Chriſtendom.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40863:4"/>
Chriſtendom the Glory of <hi>Europe.</hi> All its Advantages founded on Chriſtianity, and Diſadvantages on Pagan-and-Anti-chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianiſm. Shameful Diſſentions of Chriſtians and Chriſtian Princes and States. Lamentable Diſorders, Perſecutions, and Inquiſitions for Religion and Conſcience in <hi>Europe.</hi> Liberty of the ſame commended. Revolutions of the World. Preſent flouriſhing of <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>EUROPE is at this day the moſt flouriſing part of the Univerſe, for Empire, Religion, and Learning, Arts and Arms, and all the high diſtinctions of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane kind. And as ſhe now exceeds all other Parts; ſo the preſent all former Ages and Generations. It is not our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe at preſent in this General Table to make Compariſons, and ſet her off by the others ſad countenance: but onely, in firſt drawing ſome plain and rude Lineaments, to expoſe to general view her preſent Portraiture and Appearance; with ſome proſpect of her future.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Europe</hi> then might be compar'd either with other parts, or former Times of the World; and every way we ſhould find her to excel. For though for largeneſs of extent ſhe yeilds both to <hi>Africa</hi> and to <hi>Aſia;</hi> yet ſhe ſurpaſſes them in polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and they all ſeem rude and barbarous in compariſon; and has got thoſe advantages and felicities above them, that all their Riches cannot equal. And if for vaſtneſs of ſingle Empire, and Treaſure, and dependencies thereon, ſhe cannot come in competition with the times of the <hi>Roman</hi> Greatneſs, yet take her divided, and all her parts together, and ſhe far exceeds them. And by how much her Empire ſince has been diſpoſed into divers hands; by ſo much have her ſeveral parts been more puiſſant and flouriſhing. The whole Glory of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> then was contracted into a very narrow compaſs and one little corner onely, and (as I may ſay) Toe of <hi>Italy.</hi> For what was <hi>England, France, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> &amp;c. to w<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="3 letters">

are now? ſurely infinitly more inglorious and deſpicable. She could not then look down upon her Feet and inferior parts, and not be like the Peacock, aſhamed in the height of all her pride.</p>
            <p>For if we ſhould compare her, for Arts or for Arms, for the Virtues of War and of Peace, and therein all things elſe, (her Courts, her Camps, her Schools, her Cities, and her Fields) we ſhould find no degrees of compariſon, nor room in this Table. We will only touch upon things looſly here, as beſides our preſent intent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aſia</hi> perhaps has ſhewn <hi>Europe</hi> that prodigious Art of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Cannon: But <hi>Europe,</hi> in revenge, has requited her with another as great, and by the Chard and Compaſs taught her, and the World beſides, the uſe of that Invention. For with her Ordinance and Men of War, ſhe has ſecur'd all the Coaſts both of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and the <hi>Indies,</hi> and thoſe moreover of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> and of <hi>Peru.</hi> She has quell'd the <hi>Sophies</hi> and the <hi>Mogulls,</hi> and ſeiz'd on their Harbours, and utterly deſtroyed the vaſt Empires of <hi>Mexico</hi> and the <hi>Ynca's.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thoſe grand <hi>Heroes</hi> of the firſt and ſecond Monarchy, and of the two laſt alſo, ſo nois'd of in Hiſtory, never drove their Conqueſts ſo far as we. And all the Exploits of a <hi>Cyrus</hi> in <hi>Aſia,</hi> of a <hi>Cambyſus</hi> in <hi>Africa,</hi> of a <hi>Darius</hi> and his Sons in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> and not long ſince of a <hi>Tamberlane</hi> in all three, no not of an <hi>Alexander</hi> and of a <hi>Caeſar</hi> themſelves, come not near the bold courſes and Enterprizes of our Weſtern People, who are ſeiz'd on all the Coaſts of the Ocean, and make all the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſances of the two Continents to tremble. And they may be parallel'd with a <hi>Charlemaign,</hi> with a Great <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> with a <hi>Guſtavus</hi> of <hi>Swede,</hi> and a Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Graecian</hi> built his Glory, and erected Triumphs of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, and Trophies of Honour, upon the delicacy of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian,</hi> and nakedneſs of the <hi>Indian;</hi> and the <hi>Roman,</hi> for the moſt part, upon the diviſion or rudeneſs of the Nations, and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

'Tis not many years ſince, that under the Conduct of a <hi>Degesfield</hi> in <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> ten <hi>Chriſtians</hi> have beat an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>Turks.</hi> The Cavalry, the Infantry, the Fortifications, the Engines, the Inſtruments and Weapons of War, offenſive and defenſive; the Stratagems and Plots, the Military Diſcipline and Skill, the War-Ships, or Men of War, and Fire-Ships, is beyond all former times, or other parts of the World. <hi>Candia</hi> and <hi>Venice</hi> alone, at this day, is a notorious inſtance of the particulars. The Ships and Sea-Fights of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> are not to be match'd by all Antiquity, or other Parts of the World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>France</hi> is able to raiſe 200000 men, and ſcarce miſs them in her Cities, or her Fields; which the whole <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire cannot do, without laying it ſelf waſte. And it goes in like manner with <hi>England, Germany,</hi> and many other Countreys. And for Power &amp; Force by Sea, all the other three parts of the World together, cannot match three only <hi>Europaean</hi> Nations.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Sciences, Inventions</hi> and <hi>Improvements,</hi> ſhe ſtill carries it higher from all the reſt; and they now have their Reign and Empire only in her Dominions, and that more glorious than ever. <hi>Aſia,</hi> from whence they firſt came, muſt now call her Miſtriſs. And haughty <hi>China</hi> her ſelf, ſubmits now to be her Diſciple. <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Old Rome</hi> too (where they were once confin'd) muſt now abate their Pride, and yeild to her the preheminence. For though there was a time when the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> counted all beſides Barbarians, and rude, yet they could not do ſo now, ſhould they appear with all their Bays and Laurels. And though <hi>China</hi> has preſum'd her ſelf hitherto the Eye of the World, yet ſhe has of late been ſo dazled with the ſplendor of her Rays, that ſhe is not aſhamed to confeſs her ſelf blind in compariſon. The learned <hi>Jeſuites</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:40863:5"/>
made them firſt ſee the diſparity; for they were ſtruck with ſuch wonder and amazement at their appearance, as if they had never ſeen the Sun before, nor Learning ever aroſe in their Hemiſphere; and could not ſufficiently admire at their Science. We will produce here, to this end, their Story, out of <hi>Kir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher's China Illuſtrata,</hi> which is but of yeſterday, and make it appear what Veneration they had for the <hi>Europaean</hi> Arts and Myſteries.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Riccius</hi> the firſt Propagator of the Chriſtian Religion, and <hi>Adams</hi> the laſt Inſtaurator and Finiſher of the <hi>New China Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendar,</hi> not without the general applauſe and congratulation of the whole Empire, were had in ſuch high eſteem amongſt them, and received ſuch Honours and Favours, that hardly any Hiſtory can parallel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Riccius,</hi> a learned Mathematician, did ſo allure the mind of the Vice-Roy of <hi>Canton,</hi> where he firſt landed, with Curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Art and Science; that as neither He nor all <hi>China</hi> ever ſaw the like, ſo he received them like Angels deſcended from Heaven, rather than Inhabitants and Strangers of the Earth; and all the Learned amongſt them ſtrove for his acquaintance, and ſent to him from all parts, deſirous to behold the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful things which he had brought with him, and to be acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with his Arts: And though nothing but what is common, and obvious amongſt us here, yet they ſeem'd a kind of Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles to them. Amongſt other Things, was admired a <hi>Clock<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> curiouſly contriv'd, which ſhew'd various diſtinctions of hours with the courſe of Sun and Moon. A Glaſs-<hi>Trigon,</hi> which ſome ſuppoſed an ineſtimable Gem, others a piece of the Heavenly Sphears. Geographick Maps, they wondring to ſee Worlds, and vaſt Empires and Kingdoms beyond their Walls; Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining that <hi>China</hi> was ſet in the midſt of the Earth, like a large Gem in a Ring, and all the reſt but as Gold to the Diamond; and a little troubled to find their ſpacious Empire, beyond which they thought there was none, confin'd to ſuch a remote
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40863:6"/>
corner of the Eaſt, and <hi>Europe</hi> divided into ſo many glorious Monarchies and Kingdoms, ſo far diſtant in the remote Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of the Weſt; and the whole Earth ſo ſurrounded by the main Ocean, and ſevered into ſo many Continents, Lands and Iſlands, and as it were New Worlds. In ſo much that <hi>Riccius</hi> ſeeing them a little diſpleaſed, was fain to deſcribe the World in a larger form into two Hemiſphears, ſo as <hi>China</hi> ſhould ſtand in the midſt: And therein afterwards illuſtrated all Countries and Parts in the <hi>China</hi> Character and Language; with which they were infinitely taken, and flock'd in multitudes to ſee, ſo that the Houſe where it was could not contain them; And therefore at the Vice-Roys charge it was cut and printed, and Draughts thereof ſent through all the Empire, which made all the Learned and Curious admire him, as another <hi>Atlas</hi> dropt down from the Stars, and moſt famous <hi>Aſtrologer</hi> of the whole World. And with theſe and the like Rarities and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſities of Art, he became admirable throughout all the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Adams</hi> tranſcended him, and by reaſon of his incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble skill in the Mathematicks, and their own Language, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came yet more famous; And at laſt highly courted and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſed by the new <hi>Tartarian</hi> Emperor himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who made him one of his moſt intimate Familiars and Counſellors, and <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darine</hi> of the firſt Order, and aſſigned him the higheſt place in the <hi>Aſtronomical Tribunal,</hi> for emendation of the <hi>Calendar,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding all <hi>Aſtronomers</hi> throughout his Empire to obſerve his Orders. He wondred at his infallible Prediction of Eclipſes, at his expertneſs in caſting Ordinance, and Counſel in State-Affairs. He honoured him as his Father, with higheſt love and affection, thinking ſomething more than humane in him. And when few were admitted to his preſence beſides his Queens and Eunuchs; yet he had leave wher-ever he found the King, at home or abroad, to approach unto him; which was ſcarce granted to any elſe: called Him in their language, <hi>Venerable</hi>

Would viſit all the corners of their Colledge with him, and divert himſelf with him alone in his ſorry Chamber, laying aſide all State and Ceremony, fit for ſo great a Monarch; and obſerv'd towards him by all others; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſitting upon his Straw-Bed, made like a Monks; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times upon an old Stool, to contemplate the Rarities of <hi>Europe;</hi> yea, was pleaſed alſo ſometimes to taſte of the domeſtick fruits of their Garden, with great ſatisfaction and pleaſure; admired at their Altars and Pictures, their Splendour and Curiouſneſs; at the Fairneſs and Elegancy of their Printed Books, the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and the Cuts. But that which is more than all Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he commanded by his Royal Edict, to be engrav'd on an huge Marble-Stone, erected before the Doors of their Church, (which was alſo built through his favour, and finiſhed <hi>Anno</hi> 1650.) his Royal Approbation of the Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, partly in the <hi>Tartarian,</hi> and partly in the <hi>China</hi> Character and Language, which Charter to this very day is expoſed to be ſeen in the Jeſuites Gallery at <hi>Rome,</hi> as it was printed in <hi>China;</hi> (and is moreover drawn by an excellent hand in <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Tartarian</hi> Characters alſo, white, upon a black Fund or Bottom in the ſaid Gallery likewiſe;) The tenour whereof, (that you may ſee the high eſteem of this learned Jeſuite, for his Art, and Skill and great Science) is as follows.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THe Heavenly Science <hi>Aſtronomy,</hi> which our Anceſtours always made higheſt account of, deſerves that We alſo ſhould follow their ſteps, and extol it above the Skies; eſpecially ſeeing the ſame was heretofore under divers Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours wholly declined and decayed, and again reſtored, and chiefly in the time of the Empire of Juen, Emperour <hi>Tartarean,</hi> who govern'd the <hi>Chinois</hi> above 400 years ſince, was rendred more exact by Co ru kim, and finally at length did too much err in the laſt times of the fore-going Emperour Mim. There has been found one <hi>Johan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes Adamus Schall,</hi> coming from the utmoſt Weſt into <hi>China,</hi> who was expert not onely in the Art of Calculation, but alſo in the <hi>Theory</hi> of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, and whatſoever pertains unto Aſtronomy. He being brought before the Emperour our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſor, by his Command undertook the care of the Acadamy of <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> and Reſtoration of <hi>Aſtronomy.</hi> But becauſe many underſtood not the fruit that flows from this Science, it could not
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40863:7"/>
then be concluded, that the Subjects ſhould uſe that Science of his. But now when I came to the Empire, and my firſt care was, for the Order of Times, for the Good of the Realm, in the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn of the very firſt year of my Reign, ſeeking an experiment of that Art, which <hi>John Adams</hi> had reſtor'd, I commanded to be obſerv'd moſt dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, the Eclipſe of the Sun calculated by him ſometime before; And it being found that, aſwel the Moments of Time, as the Ecliptick Points, with all other Circumſtances, did exactly anſwer his Calculation. And again, in the Spring of the following Year, when an Eclipſe of the Moon offered it ſelf, commanding the ſame to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, with the ſame diligence, I alſo found that not to erre an hairs breadth neither; wherefore I preſently apprehended that this Man was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to us from Heaven at ſuch a time as this, wherein I undertook the Government of ſo great an Empire, and thereupon committed the whole preſidence of the <hi>Mathematick Tribunal</hi> to him only. But becauſe <hi>John Adams</hi> from his Childhood is chaſt (and has led a ſingle life) nor will meddle with any affairs not agreeing with his Religious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of life, I thought neceſſary, by abſolute com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, to oblige him to undertake this charge, and to add the dignity of the ſecond Order, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Title of <hi>Maſter of the Heavenly Area<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na's.</hi>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:40863:8"/>
In which office being now imployed ſome years, he adds daily more and more ſtudy and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence. And becauſe he has a Temple near the Gate of the City, call'd Xun che Muen, where, according to the Rites of his Law, he offers Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to God; I alſo contributed ſome ſupply toward the building and adorning it: And when I entred that Temple, I perceived the Images and Utenſils to have the appearance of extraneous and forreign things alſo. And concerning the Books of the Law, which I found placed on a Table, when I had ask'd what was contained in them? the ſaid <hi>John Adams</hi> anſwered, That they contain'd an explication of the Divine Law. And truly I, ſeeing I had formerly apply'd my mind to the Doctrine Yao Xun Cheu, and Cum Cu, I perceived ſomething out of their Books. In the Books Foe and I au, although I read ſome things, yet nothing ſticks in my memory. But ſeeing I could not hitherto, by reaſon of the grand Affairs of the Kingdom, look into the Books of this Divine Law, but only by the by; I cannot give an exact judgment out of them, concerning that Law. But yet when I conſider <hi>John Adams,</hi> who having liv'd for many years among the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nois,</hi> and with us, both obſerves and practiſes this Law, I judge it to be exceeding Good. For <hi>John Adams</hi> does ſo reverence his God, that he has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40863:8"/>
this Temple to him, conforming himſelf to this Law, with ſo great modeſty and integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Perſon, for ſo many years, alwayes after the ſame manner and method; and not a jot va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying therefrom: This truly is an expreſs ſign, that 'tis a Law of the higheſt perfection, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>John Adams</hi> himſelf is ſeen to excel with ſuch moſt approved vertue; ſeeing what that Law teaches, namely to ſerve God, obey Kings and Magiſtrates, to do evil to no man, to ſeek the Publick, and our Neighbour's good, he exactly fulfills with his fidelity. And would to God Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, and all my Subjects, would imitate this his Induſtry and Diligence in ſerving God, and keeping the Divine Law, and would but come any thing near it, in obeying their Emperour; without doubt it would go far better by many degrees, and more proſperouſly with me, and the whole Kingdom. As for me, I mightily approve of, and commend this his mind, and this Law; And therefore in perpetual memory of this thing, I prefix before his Church, this Title, I um hiven hia Kim, That is, <hi>An excellent place to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate Heaven.</hi> Given at Pekin, in the ſeventh year of Our Empire.</p>
               <p>Whereby may be ſeen the Emperour's high eſteem of this man, and conſequently of the preheminence of the <hi>Europae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> Science and Art. For the Church it ſelf it was built upon

               </p>
               <p>Which plainly ſhews that there lacks only common Candor and Ingenuity, and but tolerable civility of men, (much more of Chriſtians) not to talk of prudence, to introduce a reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Liberty of Conſcience; and but that aequanimity and largeneſs of heart for Religion (as is for other matters) amongſt different perſwaſions; and that only due liberty and freedom thereof, that is the common right of mankind; even if it were but that, they would give to one another, which they would have, and may and do receive, among Idolaters, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, and Mahometans, (for the Chriſtians have their Churches and Temples in <hi>Turky,</hi> and even <hi>China</hi> it ſelf, though they have none permitted here neither) I ſay, there lacks onely this <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable liberty and largeneſs of Chriſtian Religion,</hi> to make <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom</hi> and the <hi>World</hi> happy.</p>

               <p>For ſo it is, that all things have their Revolutions and Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ods, (both in regard of Times and of Places, from one place to another, in one Age, and then in another) and that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple which now live between the <hi>Euxine Streights,</hi> and the <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantick Ocean,</hi> eclipſe all the Sparkling and Pomp of Ancient <hi>Perſia</hi> her ſelf.

                  <head>GOVERNMENTS.</head>
                  <p>We begin therefore this ſecond Part <hi>General,</hi> with the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Governments of</hi> Europe, intending onely <hi>General</hi> Heads of Things in this <hi>General Table.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Government</hi> is conſidered either as Civil or Eccleſiaſtick. <hi>The Civil Government of</hi> Europe <hi>in general,</hi> is either purely Monarchick, of a ſingle Sovereign, or Ariſtocratick of the Nobles and Senators, or after a ſort Democratick, and Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, of the People, commonly call'd, <hi>Common Wealth,</hi> (for there's ſcarce any that is purely ſo, except you will reckon ſome few among the Petty <hi>Cantons</hi> of the <hi>Suiſſes,</hi> which make but a little member of that great Body) or mixt of theſe. But more particularly, whether one or the other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Principal Crowns, and States Sovereign of</hi> EUROPE, (for they are not all worthy of the high Title of Monarchies) may be reduc'd to Empires, Kingdoms, Principalities, Dutchies, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicks, or Common-Wealths; together with the Papality and State of the Pope, as a Temporal Prince in <hi>Italy,</hi> and the County of <hi>Venaiſſy,</hi> which makes a Sovereignty apart.</p>
                  <p>After which rate <hi>Europe</hi> has two Empires, ſeven Kingdoms, ſeven Electorſhips, and of late years, an eight; ſeven grand
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:40863:17"/>
Dutchies, ſeven Republicks or Common-Wealths, three grand Principalities, (which are now all tributary to the grand Segnior) and a Papality.</p>
                  <p>The two Empires, are the Empire of <hi>Germany,</hi> half Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, half Common-Wealth, the Emperor not being abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, but onely in the Lands whereof he is Lord and owner. And the Empire of the <hi>Turks,</hi> who are ſubject to one onely Monarch. Some add the Empire of <hi>Ruſſia</hi> for a third.</p>
                  <p>The ſeven Kingdoms, are the Kingdom of <hi>France, Spain, Portugal, England, Denmark, Sweedland,</hi> and <hi>Poland.</hi> The firſt, the moſt perfect, and deſcends only to the Heirs Male, ever ſince the <hi>Salique</hi> Law. The five next admit the Females; and all are haereditary ſave the laſt, which is Elective. But though all theſe Eſtates be purely Monarchick, yet the three latter (beſides <hi>Poland)</hi> are not abſolute Monarchies, nor leave their Kings ſo much elbow-room, nor their Commands ſo abſolute and Sovereign as the other.</p>
                  <p>There are moreover in <hi>Europe</hi> other leſſer Kingdoms com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended under theſe; as thoſe of <hi>Bohemia</hi> and <hi>Hungary,</hi> under the Emperor. That of <hi>Navarre,</hi> under the Crown of <hi>France.</hi> Thoſe of <hi>Naples, Sicily, Sardinia,</hi> and <hi>Maiorck,</hi> under the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> And thoſe of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> under the King of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Seven Electors, three Eccleaſiaſtick, four Saecular, and of late a fifth, are the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Mentz,</hi> Dean of the Colledge of Electors, Lord High-Chancellor of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire in <hi>Germany.</hi> The Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Colen,</hi> Lord High-Chancellor of the Empire in <hi>Italy.</hi> The Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi> Lord High-Chancellor of the Empire in <hi>France.</hi> The King of <hi>Bohemia</hi> at this time Emperor, (till the young King his Son come to be inſtalled therein) chief Cup-bearer of the Empire. Count <hi>Palatine</hi> of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> heretofore the fifth Elector, chief Almoner of the Houſhold; now the eighth, and Lord High-Treaſurer, ſince the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:40863:18"/>
was put in his place; The Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> Lord High-Marſhal, (or Sword-Bearer); and the Marqueſs of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> Lord High-Chamberlain, and who has the largeſt Territories next the Emperor himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Electors are Sovereign in their Eſtates, and though Members of the Empire, yet can make Peace and War when they pleaſe, whereof we have at this preſent a ſad example be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Elector Palatine, and the Elector of <hi>Mentz,</hi> with the <hi>Lorrainers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Eccleſiaſtick Electors ever had the precedency of the other, by reaſon of the height and Supremacy of the Pope in Temporals, and the Saecular Power of the Biſhops in former times.</p>
                  <p>The ſeven Grand Dutchies or Dukedoms which have each their particular Lords and Maſters, are the Dukedom of <hi>Moſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covy,</hi> (the Prince whereof aſſumes the Title of Emperor, and by ſome is reckoned among Empires; As indeed to ſay the truth, it is a Dukedom on which depends thirty other Dutchies, and three Kingdoms, which exceed <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Poland</hi> in extent, and notwithſtanding all their Cold, are fill'd with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants. And the Duke himſelf is abſolute over his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.) The Dutchy of <hi>Savoy,</hi> at this day, the firſt in <hi>Europe,</hi> the Dutchy of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> of <hi>Saxony</hi> and <hi>Bavaria,</hi> whoſe Dukes are Electors, and the Dutchy of <hi>Holſtein.</hi> As for the great Duke of <hi>Lithuania,</hi> he is ſubject to the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> and the Dutchy of <hi>Milan</hi> to the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> And the other petty Dutchies of <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> are not of any force or reckoning with theſe ſeven.</p>
                  <p>We muſt crown all theſe Dutchies or Dukedoms, with the one only Arch-Dukedom of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> whereof the Emperor is Maſter; and add that all theſe Eſtates have nothing mixt in the form of their Government, and that they acquieſs under the Authority of one alone.</p>
                  <p>The ſeven Common-Wealths, are thoſe of the <hi>Suiſſes,</hi> of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:40863:18"/>
                     <hi>Venice,</hi> of the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> of <hi>Genoa,</hi> of <hi>Lucca,</hi> of <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,</hi> and of <hi>Raguza.</hi> For the petty Common-Wealth of St. <hi>Marine,</hi> muſt not come into this Range.</p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>Hans</hi>-Towns, and free Cities of <hi>Germany,</hi> they acknowledge ſome ſubjection or other to the Empire, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The three grand Principalities are, <hi>Tranſilvania, Wallachia,</hi> and <hi>Moldavia,</hi> all three tributary to the <hi>Turk.</hi> As for the Prince of <hi>Precopia,</hi> or leſſer <hi>Tartary,</hi> called the <hi>Crim Tartar,</hi> he is now made ſlave to the <hi>Turk,</hi> and over him a Beglerbeg, or Baſſa, to command in chief.</p>
                  <p>It will not, perhaps, diſtaſt the Reader to give a Liſt here of the preſent Kings and Princes, according to their different Ages together.</p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>Spain, Swedeland,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> the Land-grave of <hi>Heſſe-Caſſel,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Modena,</hi> are yet in their Minority.</p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>France, England, Portugal,</hi> the Elector of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varia,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> the Duke Regent of <hi>Holſtein,</hi> the Dukes of <hi>Lunenburgh,</hi> the Landgrave of <hi>Heſſe-darmſtat,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Mickleburgh,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Mount-Belliard,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Eaſt-Friezland,</hi> the Marqueſs of <hi>Bada,</hi> the grand Duke of <hi>Moſcovy,</hi> and the grand Segnior; All theſe Princes are in the prime of their Age, and like to reign long.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe that have paſſed the middle of their dayes, and begin to draw towards their evening, are the Pope, (alwayes) the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> who has now lately reſign'd his Crown, and none other yet choſe; the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> the three Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors Eccleſiaſtick, three of the Secular, the Palatine, the Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of <hi>Saxony,</hi> and of <hi>Brandenburgh;</hi> the three Princes of <hi>Tranſilvania, Walachia,</hi> and <hi>Moldavia.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain, Wittenburgh, Newburgh, Brunſwick, Wolfen-Buttel,</hi> the great Duke of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Parma.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Eccleſiaſtick Government of <hi>Europe,</hi> in general, is either Papal, owning the Pope as Supream; or Epiſcopal,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:40863:19"/>
owning the King as Supream, in all cauſes; and Arch-Biſhops and Biſhops under him; call'd alſo <hi>Prelatical,</hi> (as in the Church of <hi>England)</hi> or <hi>Super-intendent,</hi> which is a kind of <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> among the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> but yet owning no Head of the Church, neither Pope, nor King, or Civil Magiſtrate, to order the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the Church, as ſuch. The <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> or <hi>Synodical,</hi> owning a Presbytery, or Synod, as Supream, and Lay-Elders, &amp;c. but no Biſhops, nor Super-intendents, as in <hi>France, Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> &amp;c. As for other forms of Government, there are none eſtabliſhed any where by publick Authority. And this is the preſent face almoſt of <hi>Europe</hi> in General.</p>

                  <p>The preſent Languages of <hi>Europe,</hi> for we paſs by thoſe that are out of date, as the Hebrew, Greek, and Latine, which are rather Scholaſtical, than National, and onely us'd among the Learned, may be reduced to three, the <hi>Teutonick,</hi> the <hi>Sclavonian,</hi> and the derivatives of Latin and Greek corrupted. By the way only take notice, that the <hi>Arabick</hi> Tongue is the ſame in <hi>Aſia,</hi> that the Latin is in <hi>Europe,</hi> and that by its help, one may march from the <hi>Boſphorus</hi> in <hi>Europe,</hi> to the furthermoſt Lands of the Indians. We find not therefore in <hi>Europe</hi> more then two Mother Tongues at preſent, which have each their ſeveral Dialects, with ſome ſprouts, as it were, of the two dead Languages, Latin and Greek.</p>
                  <p>The two Mother Languages then, are the <hi>Teutonick,</hi> and the <hi>Sclavonian:</hi> The <hi>Sclavonian</hi> is familiar at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and even at <hi>Grand Caire;</hi> And has for its principal Dialects, the <hi>Rheuthenick,</hi> or <hi>Ruſſian,</hi> for the <hi>Moſcovites;</hi> the <hi>Dalmattan</hi> for the <hi>Tranſilvanians,</hi> and <hi>Hungarians;</hi> the <hi>Bohemian,</hi> and the <hi>Polonian;</hi> the <hi>Illyrian, Jazigian,</hi> &amp;c. with ſome others which have their courſe amongſt the <hi>Walachians,</hi> and the <hi>Moldavians,</hi> and the leſſer <hi>Tartary.</hi>

                  <p>We might find out yet ſeven other Tongues in <hi>Europe,</hi> but of far leſs extent then the preceding, and not nois'd of in the World; As the <hi>Albanian,</hi> (or <hi>Epirotick)</hi> in <hi>Epirus,</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia;</hi> The <hi>Bulgarian</hi> for <hi>Servia, Boſnia</hi> and <hi>Bulgaria,</hi> under the <hi>Turks.</hi> The <hi>Coſſack</hi> or <hi>Tartarian</hi> of the leſſer <hi>Tartary,</hi> in the <hi>Taurica Cherſoneſus,</hi> and all along the River <hi>Tanais.</hi> The <hi>Finnick,</hi> in <hi>Finland,</hi> and <hi>Lapland,</hi> Provinces of <hi>Swedeland.</hi> That of the Wilde-<hi>Iriſh</hi> and <hi>Scotch,</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the Weſt of <hi>Scotland.</hi> The <hi>Britiſh,</hi> or <hi>Welch,</hi> in <hi>Wales,</hi> and ſome parts of <hi>Cornwal</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and half through <hi>Bretain Armorica,</hi> or <hi>Little Britain,</hi> in <hi>France.</hi> And laſtly, the <hi>Biſcayan,</hi> on this ſide,

and that ſide the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Hills, and near to the <hi>Cantabrian</hi> Ocean, as little underſtood to the reſt of the World, as the old <hi>Britiſh</hi> it ſelf.

                  <p>Of all theſe Languages there are ſome <hi>Maſculine,</hi> but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing rude and harſh, as the <hi>German,</hi> and in ſome ſort the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh,</hi> through the Reliques and mixture of the <hi>Mooriſh;</hi> And ſome <hi>Faeminine,</hi> but more delicate and fine, as the <hi>Italian,</hi> and in ſome ſort the <hi>Engliſh, Which are more graceful in the mouths of the Women, (and become them beſt) than the Mens, who cannot uſe too much gravity in their Speech.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Moreover the Language of the</hi> Spaniards <hi>is ſaid to be Manly, the</hi> Italian, <hi>Courtly; and the</hi> French, <hi>Amorous; The</hi> German <hi>is like their Nation, Warlike.</hi> The <hi>Engliſh</hi> is now become a compleat mixture of all, <hi>viz.</hi> old <hi>Dutch,</hi> or <hi>Saxon, Latine,</hi> and chiefly <hi>French,</hi> with ſome ſprinklings of <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> and <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian;</hi> flouriſhing now at length with a rare choice out of all; occaſioned by the conſtant travels and education of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentry and Nobility (and Scholars with them) abroad.</p>
                  <p>By reaſon of all which diverſities of Tongues, there has been not only Deſigns, but real Endeavours and Eſſayes, and of late more than ever, towards <hi>an Univerſal Character and Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,</hi> to avoid the confuſion of theſe.

                  <p>Three Religions do at this day divide all the Earth, <hi>Heathen, Mahometan,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian.</hi> The firſt is, without doubt, the largeſt; the ſecond, in like manner, carries it from the third, and beſt; but with this difference, that this laſt is more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centred together, and fills the moſt peopled Provinces of the Univerſe.</p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>Jews,</hi> they are no Nation, but diſperſed in all, have no fixt Seat, Principalities, nor Magiſtrates. Yet their number is great, both in <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Greece,</hi> and all the <hi>Turks</hi> Dominions; beſides ſome ſprinklings in <hi>Italy, Holland,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Paganiſm,</hi> or <hi>Heatheniſm,</hi> embraces more than three quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of both the <hi>America's,</hi> and more then two thirds, even of <hi>Africa</hi> and <hi>Aſia</hi> alſo. All that prodigious ſpace of Ground of the <hi>America's,</hi> greater than all the other three parts of the World beſides put together, is fill'd with Idolaters, who wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip Animals, Vegetables, Stars, and Devils. And com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends innumerable vaſt Regions, (populous) Nations, and mighty Kingdoms. And in <hi>Africa</hi> and <hi>Aſia</hi> in like manner, a fearful company of Nations, Kindreds and People live in thick darkneſs of <hi>Paganiſm</hi> and Ignorance of the true God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mahometiſm</hi> never yet had footing in <hi>America;</hi> But in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frick,</hi> the mighty Kingdoms of <hi>Fez</hi> and <hi>Morocco,</hi> the Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions of <hi>Tremiſen, Algiers, Tunis, Tripolis,</hi> of <hi>Barce,</hi> and <hi>Egypt.</hi> In <hi>Aſia,</hi> the Grand Seignor, the Kings and Princes of the three <hi>Arabia's,</hi> the Grand <hi>Cham</hi> of <hi>Tartary,</hi> the King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> the Grand <hi>Mogul,</hi> the Kings of <hi>Viſapor,</hi> and <hi>Colconda.</hi> The Kings on both the ſides of <hi>Coromandel,</hi> and of <hi>Malavar.</hi> The <hi>King</hi> of the <hi>Maldives.</hi> The <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Achem,</hi> and all the Princes of the Grand Iſle of <hi>Sumatra;</hi> The Emperor of <hi>Java;</hi> The <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Bantam;</hi> and other Princes of the Neighbouring
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:40863:21"/>
Iſles; For their people are generally Idolaters. Which we ought no more to wonder at, than at the medly that is found in like manner among Chriſtians themſelves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Chriſtianiſm</hi> makes two Grand Branches, the Trunk or Body whereof is in <hi>Europe,</hi> but the Branches extend themſelves far and near into all the parts of the Univerſe, both <hi>Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> and <hi>America.</hi> And they are the Eaſtern Chriſtians, (or the Eaſtern and Greek Church) the Roman Chriſtians, or Papiſts, (the corrupt Church) and the Proteſtant Chriſtians, (or Reformed Church) both members of the Latin, (or We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern Church) in oppoſition to the Greek, or Eaſtern. The Greek Church differs chiefly from the Latin, about the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the Holy Ghoſt, and ſome other Points and Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Faith. The Proteſtant from the Papiſtical, chiefly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Popes Supremacy and Infallability, Sacrament of the Altar, and Indulgences, which gave the firſt occaſion, and other corrupt Points and Doctrines, ſtabliſh'd ſince by the <hi>Council of Trent.</hi> The Romans call themſelves the <hi>Catholick Apoſtolical Church,</hi> but moſt unjuſtly, and all the reſt Hereticks: and the Proteſtants reckon themſelves the onely true <hi>Catholick Apoſtolick,</hi> and call the others the <hi>Antichriſtian, Babyloniſh,</hi> or falſe, and themſelves the <hi>Reformed Church;</hi> which indeed is true, ſo far as they are truly reformed. But yet 'tis much to be fear'd, and ſhrewdly to be ſuſpected, that Antichriſt reaches further than <hi>Rome,</hi> and that all <hi>Rome,</hi> 'tis to be hoped, is not <hi>Babylon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Chriſtians of the Eaſt make up a great number, and poſſeſs large Countries; the Chriſtians Roman, and the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians Proteſtant, may diſpute for Number and Power, and make compariſon. We make none here, but only of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces which they poſſeſs, without going beyond our mark, intending only a bare Relation, or plain Table, and no Zeal of Compariſons.</p>
                  <p>In the Eaſtern Church are alſo many differences crept in; but
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:40863:21"/>
the Greeks bear the chief ſway, although both the <hi>Armenia's,</hi> who make a company apart, are a conſiderable Body. We put all together here, the <hi>Greeks,</hi> the <hi>Abyſſins,</hi> the <hi>Armenians,</hi> and the <hi>Muſcovites;</hi> the <hi>Neſtorians,</hi> the <hi>Cophites,</hi> the <hi>Maronites,</hi> the <hi>Georgians,</hi> the <hi>Jacobites,</hi> and the <hi>Melchites,</hi> or <hi>Aſſyrians.</hi> In the Reformed Church of the Proteſtants, are the two great Sects of the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> and the <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> which we put both together, as <hi>Proteſtants</hi> united againſt the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> and now alſo labouring hard on both ſides to unite among themſelves, though the latter only took the Title of <hi>Reformed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As we blame the pride and haughtineſs of the <hi>Chineſes,</hi> who before that the <hi>Tartars</hi> had humbled them, believed that all the reſt of the Univerſe, beyond their Mountains and Walls that encompaſs them, was wholly deſolate or barbarous. In like manner ought we not to ſuffer an infinity of Ignorants, who becauſe, perhaps in <hi>Colen,</hi> they ſee but an hundred <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,</hi> or ſo, preſently imagine the ſame of all <hi>Germany,</hi> and of the whole World, and reckon their Church <hi>Catholick,</hi> when 'tis but a moity of the leaſt part of the Earth; and not eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things but by their outward ſplendor and glittering, paſs unjuſtly from the unequal eſteem, and falſe count of their number, to the unequal eſteem, or falſe count of their Virtue and Cauſe. Beſides the advantage of Number is no great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. The <hi>Mahometans</hi> on this account carry it from the Chriſtians; and the very Heathens from both. So that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the one or the other have any great reaſon to glory. The only glorying is to have God on their ſide. But let us come to the Countries which each poſſeſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Europe,</hi> as was ſaid, is almoſt all Chriſtendom. Yet Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters and Heathen are ſtill found in the cold Region of the <hi>Laplanders;</hi> and although they are diſtinguiſhed into <hi>Danes, Swedes,</hi> and <hi>Moſcovites,</hi> yet they hardly obey, either the Duke <hi>Moſcovy,</hi> or the King of <hi>Suede,</hi> or of <hi>Denmark<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mahometa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm</hi> is more ſpread, but not beyond the <hi>Turks</hi> Territories:
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:40863:22"/>
It is follow'd at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> in <hi>Romania,</hi> and in the places of <hi>Dalmatia</hi> and <hi>Hungary,</hi> where he is Maſter. It has its courſe, alſo in the <hi>Taurick Cherſoneſe,</hi> and the leſſer <hi>Tartary.</hi> But all theſe Countries together, make not above one tenth part of <hi>Europe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>Judaiſm</hi> onely lurks in little corners and holes of Chriſtendom, and dares hardly ſhew its face but with ſome kind of diſgrace and infamy; Witneſs their yellow Hats in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Avignon,</hi> for a mark of diſhonour. Yet the Jews have their Synagogues, and their principal ones are at <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, Avignon, Rome, Venice,</hi> and divers other places of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Italy.</hi> They are found moreover at <hi>Franck-fort, Hamburgh,</hi> and other Cities of <hi>Germany,</hi> and ſome at <hi>London</hi> alſo through connivance, though the Laws be againſt them. But they are leaſt troubled in <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Bohemia;</hi> and there, as well for their Number, as for their Priviledges, through the force of Silver Weapons, they make ſomething a greater noiſe than elſewhere. <hi>Greece</hi> is yet fuller, they have free Trade at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and <hi>Grand Caire;</hi> They manage principal Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs; they have places of Profit and Revenues, and generally they are powerful through all the <hi>Ottomans</hi> Empire. For Chriſtians, according to the three Branches of Chriſtianiſm mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi> the Chriſtians of the Eaſt, the Chriſtians Roman, and the Chriſtians Proteſtant, they take up all the reſt.</p>
                  <p>The Chriſtians of the Eaſt, or the Eaſtern Church, advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagiouſly divide with the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> and the <hi>Jews,</hi> all <hi>Greece,</hi> and all the Neighbouring Iſles of the <hi>Archipelago.</hi> And in Mount <hi>Athos</hi> alone, for which cauſe they have ſince given it the name of <hi>Monte Sancto,</hi> or the <hi>Holy Mountain;</hi> one may ſee twenty four Monaſteries of <hi>Caloyers,</hi> or certain Monks of the Order of St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> (of which Order generally the Greek Church are) to the number of ſix thouſand.</p>
                  <p>And under this Branch comprehending all the ſeveral Sects
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:40863:22"/>
that uſe different Liturgies, the Eaſtern Church is extended yet further into <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> who are all thereof; and out of <hi>Europe</hi> into <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> and <hi>Egypt</hi> in <hi>Africa;</hi> into <hi>Georgia, Armenia, Aſſyria,</hi> and <hi>Perſia</hi> in <hi>Aſia,</hi> and if one would, even to <hi>India</hi> it ſelf, and to the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Tenduc,</hi> on the North of <hi>Cathay,</hi> where <hi>Mark Polo</hi> found ſome Chriſtians of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle.</p>
                  <p>Each of theſe Sects has their Patriarchs, and theſe Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs, like as the Biſhops alſo, are all Monks of one of the two Orders of St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> or St. <hi>Anthony,</hi> his follower.</p>
                  <p>For the other Religions, the Roman Religion is abſolute Miſtreſs in <hi>Spain, Portugal</hi> and <hi>Italy.</hi> The Religion Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in the Iſlands of Great <hi>Britane,</hi> in <hi>Swedeland</hi> and <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Roman Religion bears the ſway intirely in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Provinces of the <hi>Low Countries;</hi> the Proteſtants in the <hi>United Provinces.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Roman Religion reigns ſolely in the petty <hi>Cantons</hi> of <hi>Switzerland;</hi> the Proteſtant in the great <hi>Cantons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Roman Religion has the upper hand intirely in the Countries of the three Electors Eccleſiaſtick, of <hi>Mayence, Trevers</hi> and <hi>Colen.</hi> The Proteſtant in the Countries of three of the Electors Saecular, the Palatinate of the <hi>Rhine, Saxony,</hi> and <hi>Brandenburgh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Roman Religion has not any mixture apparent in the Haeredetary Countries of the Emperor, <hi>Auſtria, Bohemia, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravia, Tirol, Carinthia, Stiria,</hi> and <hi>Carniola,</hi> nor in the Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors the Duke of <hi>Bavaria.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Proteſtant has little or none at all, in <hi>Suavia, Sileſia,</hi> both the <hi>Pruſſi's, Pomerania, Hiſſe,</hi> the Archbiſhoprick of <hi>Breme,</hi> and in the Dukedoms of <hi>Holſtein, Lunenburgh, Meckle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh.</hi> But in the other Provinces of <hi>Germany,</hi> as in the Dutchies of <hi>Cleveland, Juliers, Alſatia, Weſtphalia,</hi> and <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conia,</hi> the two Religions are almoſt equally divided, except
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:40863:23"/>
that the Proteſtant hath all the Authority in its hand in the grand <hi>Imperial Cities</hi> hereof, and the <hi>Hans Towns,</hi> which make up the number of an hundred and fifty, whereof there are but very few to be excepted. The moſt famous are <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renburgh, Franck-fort, Wormes, Stratsburg, Ausburg, Ulms, Ratisbone, Spire, Strelſond, Wiſmar, Roſtoch, Stetin, Oſna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg, Brunſwick, Breme, Hamburgh, Lubeck, Dantzick, El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing, Conigsberg,</hi> where the Magiſtrate is Proteſtant. There is but only <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Poland,</hi> where the number of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans ſurpaſs the number of the others, and where neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs theſe have the free and publick exerciſe of their Religion, and each live together in peace; though the Romaniſts daily incroach upon the Proteſtants, and increaſe, and the others decreaſe, and loſe their Priviledges and Power, for want of ſome Heroick Princes to maintain them.</p>
                  <p>To conclude; The Roman Religion has been carried to the ends of the World, into the Eaſt, and into the Weſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Portugueſe.</hi> The Proteſtant has been carried to the ſame places by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> alſo are ſetled in the Iſle of <hi>Madagaſcar</hi> in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada,</hi> in <hi>Africa,</hi> and in <hi>America,</hi> and take their courſe alſo through <hi>Aſia,</hi> inſomuch that all are there generally call'd <hi>Franks.</hi> But theſe are almoſt univerſally <hi>French</hi> Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks.</p>
                  <p>But to take things apart; The Roman Religion is ſpread in ſome Maritine places of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and has it's principal Seat at <hi>Goa,</hi> a Puiſſant City on the Weſtern Coaſt of the <hi>Peninſula</hi> on this ſide <hi>Ganges.</hi> The Proteſtant upon the ſhores of the ſame <hi>Aſia,</hi> and has its principal Seat at <hi>Batavia,</hi> a City upon the Southern Coaſt of <hi>Grand Java,</hi> which the Commerce of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> has rendred famous.</p>
                  <p>The Roman Religion fills ſome places of the Eaſtern Coaſt of <hi>Africa,</hi> as <hi>Melinda, Moſambica, Quiloa;</hi> The Proteſtant ſome places of the ſame <hi>Africa,</hi> upon the Weſtern and Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:40863:23"/>
Coaſt, as in the Kingdom of <hi>Congo, Guiny,</hi> and <hi>Cape Verd.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Roman Religion poſſeſſes in <hi>America, Mexico,</hi> and <hi>Peru,</hi> the Iſles of <hi>Porto Rico,</hi> St. <hi>Domingo,</hi> and <hi>Cuba;</hi> alſo <hi>Braſil</hi> and <hi>Canada,</hi> and ſome of the <hi>Antilles</hi> Iſlands. The Proteſtant, in like manner, in the ſame <hi>America, New England, New Swede, New Denmark, New Holland,</hi> and <hi>Virginia,</hi> and now of late the Iſland of <hi>Jamaca,</hi> and the two thirds of the <hi>Antilles</hi> Iſlands, and heretofore the Northern part of <hi>Braſil,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>By all which you may ſee how little reaſon of Geography the Religion <hi>Roman</hi> has, to appropriate the Name <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Jeſuites, as has been ſeen by the firſt part, have alſo promoted their Religion, even into <hi>China,</hi> but 'tis not yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come National or powerful.</p>
                  <p>It reſts only to draw hence their Proportions, thus;</p>
                  <p>The Proportions of <hi>Europe, Aſia, Africa,</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> ought to be conſidered, as 1, 3, 4, and 7. So that taking only the Inhabited part of the World, the Chriſtians poſſeſs about a ſixth, the Mahometans a fifth, or ſomething more; and the Heathens two thirds, or hardly quite ſo much. So that dividing all the known Regions of the Earth into thirty equal parts; The Chriſtians part ſhall be as five, the Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans as ſix, and the Heathens as ninteeen, which is very near two thirds of thirty. As for the Chriſtians that are found in <hi>Aſia, Africa,</hi> and <hi>America;</hi> their petty number is, as it were, ſwallowed up in this fearful multitude of Mahometans and Idolators, and is elſewhere counterballanced by that of the Mahometans in <hi>Europe.</hi> And if to the Lands diſcovered, one joyn that great Southern Continent, which comes near to the very Aequator, and coaſts, as it were, continually from Eaſt to Weſt, the two other Continents of <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> ſo that it ſeems to be as large as <hi>Europe, Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africa</hi> put together;
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:40863:24"/>
then the Heathen will ſurpaſs the Mahometans and the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in an exceſſive proportion; for they will then have near as much more; for 'tis to be believed, that that part of the World has no other for its Inhabitants than Idolaters; ſeeing that they found no other at the point of good <hi>Hope,</hi> and towards the ſtreight of <hi>Magellan,</hi> which are the moſt neighbouring Lands to this vaſt Continent of the South, whoſe ſhores onely are known unto us.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the three grand Branches of the Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in <hi>Europe,</hi> out of which ariſe onely three other that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come diſtinct and National, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Lutheran,</hi> the <hi>Calviniſt,</hi> and the <hi>Epiſcoparian,</hi> all of them Proteſtant and Reformed; All of them deny the Popes Supremacy and Tranſubſtantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp;c. The Calviniſts deny both Tranſubſtantiation of the Papiſts, Conſubſtantiation of the Lutherans, and Epiſcopacy, and the Diſcipline of the others.

                  <p>The late <hi>grand Revolutions</hi> of <hi>Europe</hi> have been either of States and Kingdoms, whether for Dominion or Religion; or of Religions themſelves, or of both mixtly.

                     <head>The Foundation of the preſent <hi>Germane Empire,</hi> in the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria;</hi> which grand Revolution has made it, as it were, Haereditary; and put a period to Liberty of Elections.</head>
                     <p n="1">I. ABout the year 1250. the Empire being greatly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted through the Popes means and practices (who for above an hundred years had notoriouſly uſurped authority over the Emperors, and made a common practice of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating them in a manner ſucceſſively, for ſo many years one after the other); the Empire, I ſay, being diſtracted into many Factions, each Faction choſe a King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> or Emperor; inſomuch that there were now at one time three Elected together, and a<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>fourth a year or two after bought it, and preſently left it again, and then for ſeveral years without any. The Empire fluctuating thus for about twenty years, and after ſo long an <hi>Interregnum,</hi> the Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> met at <hi>Quidlinburg,</hi> and made a League of Defence together about the year 1270. Thereupon Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the tenth ſends or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to them to chuſe an Emperor, unleſs they would have one choſe for them. Meeting therefore at <hi>Franck-fort<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> they choſe (out of one of the weakeſt Families, every Faction grown jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and fearing the other) <hi>Rodolphus</hi> Earl of <hi>Hapsburg,</hi> in
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:40863:25"/>
the year 1270. to be Emperor, the Raiſer of the preſent Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> upon this occaſion, and grand Revolution; for by War, and by his <hi>Imperatorian</hi> Power, gaining <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and other Territories adjoyning, he confers them upon his Son: And ſo the Earls of <hi>Hapsburgh</hi> become firſt Dukes, then Arch-Dukes of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> about the year 1280. and ſo propagated their power far and near unto our times.</p>
                     <p>By this time the ſeven Electors had rooted themſelves in their uſurp'd Electorſhip, which began firſt by bare permiſſion, and under pretext of avoiding confuſion, and for better order in the Election, to take the Votes of all the other Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> what ſhould be beſt for the Common Intereſt, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards uſed and uſurped as their priviledge, and ſo continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, till they got to be eſtabliſhed therein by the <hi>Golden Bull.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">II. The <hi>Golden Bull,</hi> or Seal, is conſtituted as the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and fundamental Law of the Empire, (not to be altered by the Emperor, no not with the Electors conſent themſelves) by <hi>Charles</hi> the Fourth, in the year 1356. Yet to which ſince has been added, <hi>Capitulations</hi> of the Emperor, with the Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and Princes of <hi>Germany.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the Golden Bull was contained the Priviledges, Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Order, and mutual reſpect between the Emperor and Princes.</p>
                     <p>In it the ſeven Electors were eſtabliſhed by publick Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Law of the Empire; before ſometimes more, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times leſs, uſurped the Power to themſelves, which bred diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentions and confuſions alwayes in choice.</p>
                     <p>Alſo to hinder Haereditary Succeſſion, that three Emperors of one and the ſame Family ſhould never be choſen together, as had been by Power, Intereſt, and Factions formerly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to keep it in one Houſe; which how well obſerved the Story will ſhew, it having continued in that Line ever ſince, and become in a manner quite haereditary, and ſcarcely to be altered.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="46" facs="tcp:40863:26"/>
In it alſo was decided between the Houſe of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and the Palatine, the Controverſie about Electorſhip, which was by perpetual right then annexed to the Palatinate, and ever ſince continued ſo till the late <hi>German</hi> Wars; before each claiming the Electorſhip, which therefore often diſturbed their number to be more or leſs than ſeven.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. About the year 1500. the State of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> which contained the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> was by Marriage with the Hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs thereof, added to the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> which further ſtrengthened it.</p>
                     <p>About the ſame time under <hi>Maximilian</hi> the firſt, the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Courts of Judicature, which followed the Emperors Court, alwayes before were fixed to a certain place; and this is called the <hi>Imperial Chamber,</hi> the <hi>Supream Tribunal,</hi> and <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal of Juſtice,</hi> in which in Civil Matters, the Emperor and all the Princes ſhould be ſubject, and the greateſt Controverſies be ſubmitted to its Judgment.</p>
                     <p>It was after two removes fixed at laſt to <hi>Spires;</hi> hence the <hi>Chamber of Spires</hi> fam'd over all; and the Empire alſo divided into ten Circles, by the ſame Emperor, at the ſame time.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV.

                        <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, Son of <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Spain,</hi> Son of <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Emperor, ſucceeds his Father in his Eſtates of Inheritance of <hi>Spain, Burgundy,</hi> and the <hi>Low Countries, Auſtria,</hi> &amp;c. and by Election, his Grand-father <hi>Maximilian</hi> in the Empire, in the year 1519. under whom the <hi>German</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire roſe to its greateſt height and inlargement ever ſince the diſmembring of it.

                        <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and the <hi>Low Countries, Naples,</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi> it might equal it under <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, when it had <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> Members thereof, or ſubject thereunto; beſides the Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Milan</hi> fell to this <hi>Charles;</hi> alſo the Kingdom of <hi>Tunis,</hi> and other parts in <hi>Africa</hi> became Tributary; and moreover, married the Daughter of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and ſo laid a Foundation for that Kingdom alſo. But if you add the Weſt Indy King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, the Kingdom of <hi>Mexico</hi> overcome, <hi>Anno,</hi> 1521. the Kingdom of <hi>Peru,</hi> 1535. It had more extent, though not greatneſs and power, than all the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire ever had. And had not the <hi>French</hi> oppoſed him, he had over-ran all <hi>Europe,</hi> and been Univerſal Monarch.</p>
                     <p>He had Priſoners at the ſame time, the <hi>French</hi> King, and the Pope of <hi>Rome.</hi> He ruin'd the League made by the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> at <hi>Smalcalde</hi> in <hi>Germany.</hi> Took Priſoners the Elector of <hi>Saxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> and Landgrave of <hi>Haſſia,</hi> drove the great Turk from <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna,</hi> as well as won <hi>Tunis.</hi> But the Turk ſoon broke his Power in <hi>Africa,</hi> and being hunted out of <hi>Germany,</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned all his Eſtates and Kingdoms; the Empire to his Brother, who had been before elected King of <hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Bohemia, Anno</hi> 1526. and by the procurement of this <hi>Charles,</hi> elected King of the <hi>Romaus,</hi> 1531. and now by his Reſignation, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, 1558. The reſt of his Eſtates to his Son <hi>Philip</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and ſo went off the Stage, and died pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate in a Monaſtery, after he had been glutted, as it were, with the pomp and vanity of the World;</p>
                     <p>As Emperor of the <hi>Germans,</hi> King of <hi>Caſtile, Aragon, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, Sicily,</hi> &amp;c. Arch-Duke of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> Prince of <hi>Belgium,</hi> (or <hi>Low Countries)</hi> &amp;c. King of <hi>India,</hi> and the <hi>Ocean,</hi> &amp;c. Lord of <hi>Africa,</hi> &amp;c. But in the end on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Monk.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">V. From this time the <hi>Auſtrian</hi> Houſe took ſuch rooting in <hi>Germany,</hi> that the Empire is in name rather Elective, but in reality Haereditary, and become the Inheritance, as it were,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:40863:27"/>
of a Family; Specially after he brought in the cuſtom of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> during the Emperors life, as he did to his Brother, <hi>Anno.</hi> 1531. (which is a Title proper to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror) notwithſtanding the Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> who by many Arguments ſhewed, how it tended to inervate the free election of the Emperor.</p>
                     <p n="6">VI. Under this <hi>Charles,</hi> all <hi>Germany,</hi> both Empire and Church, is rent into two grand Factions or Parts, <hi>Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> again into <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Calviniſts;</hi> and from this diviſion aroſe the two grand Wars, the <hi>Smalcaldick</hi> and <hi>Bohemian.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The chief cauſe was the general hate of the <hi>Roman</hi> Court and Tyranny, (and baſe abuſes and corruptions thereof) both by the Princes and People, ready to take any occaſion againſt them.</p>
                     <p>But the occaſion was the common ſelling of Indulgences by an impudent Monk; whom another Monk, but honeſter, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes. Thus the two Inſtruments were two Monks, one a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Knave, or at beſt, corrupt ignorant Friar; the other an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, ſincere, and well-meaning Soul, as well as zealous, <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Luther</hi> by name, (ſuch as were many in thoſe dayes, as <hi>Thauler,</hi> whom <hi>Luther</hi> much eſteemed and praiſes); or if you will give him a truer name from his Deeds, <hi>Martin Marr-Pope,</hi> who at firſt taxes only the abuſe, and obſerves the corruptions of the Church, become too notorious for any honeſt heart; but finding no amendment, nor reformation, but things worſe and worſe, makes a general defection, <hi>Anno.</hi> 1522.</p>
                     <p>This was no ſooner done, but the Reformers make a new Schiſm, and divide between <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Zwinglius,</hi> 1524. which roſe to two grand Factions, afterwards by the name of <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Calviniſts</hi> towards the year 1560. the cauſe of much woe to <hi>Germany,</hi> and never reconciled, neither by Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces nor Paſtors, till the treaty at <hi>Munſter,</hi> 1648.</p>
                     <p>Thus <hi>Germany,</hi> and almoſt all <hi>Europe,</hi> became divided into
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:40863:27"/>
two General Factions or Parts, <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> but <hi>Germany</hi> into three, <hi>Papiſts, Lutherans,</hi> and <hi>Calviniſts:</hi> which has been the principal cauſe indeed of all Mutations and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions in all the Kingdoms and States ever ſince almoſt. Hence the Revolutions of the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> &amp;c. muſt be deriv'd, as from their origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Head and Spring.</p>
                     <p>The head of the <hi>Catholicks</hi> was the Emperor, and Popiſh-Princes; of the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Saxony;</hi> of the <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſts</hi> or Reformed, the Elector <hi>Palatine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">VII. And theſe preceding, occaſion'd alſo other Religions, and Wars for theſe, at leaſt defenſive. For at this time of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending for Liberty and Reformation, aroſe other Sects alſo, aiming, or pretending higher Reformation in Religion; So that in the year 1525, one <hi>Thomas Munzer</hi> occaſions the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick War of the Countrymen. In the year 1534, ſucceeded the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> at <hi>Munſter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the year 1529 aroſe the name <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> in the General Aſſembly at <hi>Worms,</hi> when the Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave of <hi>Haſſe,</hi> the City of <hi>Noremberg</hi> and others proteſted againſt the Decrees of Caeſar, and appeal'd to an Univerſal-Council. In the year following 1530, the Confeſſion of the Proteſtants, call'd the <hi>Auguſtan Confeſſion,</hi> was publiſhed.</p>
                     <p n="8">VIII. Upon theſe Grounds chiefly, and a little after the Troubles and Interruptions by the other Sects mentioned, breaks forth the Civil War between <hi>Caeſar</hi> and the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> called the <hi>Smalcaldick War; Anno</hi> 1547, which they began at <hi>Smalcaldia</hi> in <hi>Haſſia:</hi> where Caeſar prevails, ruins their League made there, the ſame year begun and ended. Soon after the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> revive; prevail, and in the end force the Emperor out of <hi>Germany;</hi> procure the <hi>Paſſavian</hi> Tranſaction, (or Peace made there) <hi>An.</hi> 1552, where by a perpetual Edict is eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed Liberty of either Religion, <hi>Roman-Catholick</hi> and <hi>Auguſtan Confeſſion,</hi> (that is, <hi>Proteſtant.)</hi> So the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> by agreement
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:40863:28"/>
and compact obtain'd full liberty and exemption from the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal yoke, and Peace in <hi>Germany</hi> till 1618.</p>
                     <p n="9">IX. When chiefly from the ſame hidden cauſes, grounds and motives, the Bohemian War began: For about the year 1612, <hi>Germany</hi> was again divided into two parts, the <hi>League,</hi> and the <hi>Union.</hi> The League contained the <hi>Papiſt</hi> Princes, the Union the <hi>Proteſtant.</hi> Thence about the year 1618, the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemians, according to their priyiledge, rejecting the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, as never formally nor legally choſen, (as they had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done <hi>Uladiſlaus</hi> the 3d.) elect the Count Palatine King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and crown him at <hi>Prague.</hi> Whence the Bohemian-War aroſe, and ſpread over all <hi>Germany;</hi> chang'd firſt into the Saxon, and then into the Swediſh-War, for the ſupport of the German Liberty, and laſted for thirty years, till the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty at <hi>Munſter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="10">X. The Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> overcoming the Bohemians, and the <hi>Palatine</hi> expell'd, demands and obtains the Electorſhip, (which for a hundred and fifty years before had been claimed and controverted, but by the Golden-Bull decided to the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latine)</hi> notwithſtanding the Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> and Marqueſs of <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> gainſaying, but not daring to reſiſt; about the year 1620: And ſo the <hi>Palatine</hi> was ejected out of the upper Palatinate, and the firſt place among the Electoral Princes Secular, as well as the Kingdom of <hi>Bohemia.</hi>

the former was ſecretly made away and kill'd, before his Father's death, and <hi>Theodore</hi> leaving no iſſue, leaves the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to his Brother-in-law, who proving an unmerciful Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, The Jeſuites take occaſion to ſuborn a certain Scholar of theirs in their Colledge in <hi>Poland,</hi> a <hi>Ruſſe</hi> by Nation, for the true <hi>Demetrius</hi> made away; ſo cunningly, that none of the <hi>Ruſſians,</hi> eſpecially the fickle-minded multitude, doubted, but that it was the true and lawful Heir indeed, and therefore generally flock to him, which the other Tyrant ſeeing, either with Grief or Poyſon ended his dayes, <hi>An.</hi> 1605. and the falſe <hi>Demetrius</hi> made abſolute Monarch of <hi>Ruſſia.</hi> The king of <hi>Poland</hi> and the Pope favouring the deſign.

                     <p>Hereupon the <hi>Poles,</hi> the <hi>Swedes,</hi> and the <hi>Tartars</hi> take their advantage, break-in on every ſide, under pretext of help, and the <hi>Ruſſians</hi> become a prey to them all.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Swedes</hi> help <hi>Zuskie,</hi> and the Poles <hi>Demetrius, Anno</hi> 1611, the <hi>Swedes</hi> take <hi>Novograd,</hi> and the <hi>Poles Smolensko.</hi>

                     <p>Yet the ſecond <hi>Demetrius</hi>'s Widow hires the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> to ſet up her young Son, not of age, who takes many Eaſtern Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> with the Title of <hi>Kingdom</hi> for her Son, the fourth falſe <hi>Demetrius;</hi> But this Kingdom laſted but two years: for both Mother and Son were taken and ſlain by the <hi>Ruſſes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So the Emperor firſt makes peace with <hi>Swede,</hi> who reſtor'd to him the Great Dukedom of <hi>Novograd,</hi> but keeps <hi>Livonia,</hi> (and other Northern Provinces) with the City <hi>Novograd,</hi> and add it to their Crown, ſince the occaſion of War between them.

                     <p>The great Enemies you ſee of the <hi>Ruſſes</hi> then are the <hi>Pole,</hi> the <hi>Swede,</hi> and the <hi>Tartar,</hi> helpt by the <hi>Turk: Anno</hi> 1230, the <hi>Tartars</hi> over-ran all <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> and made it tributary, and for three hundred years kept their Power over it more or leſs, and gave and took away Dukes over them, as they pleaſed. <hi>Anno</hi> 1500 <hi>Baſil</hi> ſhook off this yoke.

                     <p>King <hi>Caſimir</hi> ſucceeded, <hi>an.</hi> 1648. ſo troubled all his dayes, that he has been a long time weary of his Crown, and now at laſt laid it down, not obtaining leave to nominate his Succeſſor.</p>
                     <p>The better to underſtand the late Revolutions of <hi>Poland,</hi> in brief, take them thus.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Poland</hi> has ſuffered great Revolutions and Troubles, from forreign Enemies, Rebellious <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> and Confederate No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. Grand Enemies are the <hi>Swede,</hi> the <hi>Ruſſe,</hi> the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi> and the <hi>Turk.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Wars with the <hi>Swede</hi> are for <hi>Livonia,</hi> for pretence to the Crown of <hi>Swede,</hi> for Titles and Arms. Hereupon the late king of <hi>Sweden</hi> overran in one year almoſt all <hi>Poland,</hi> but loſt all again the next. But theſe pretences now ceaſe in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent king, having no heirs.</p>
                     <p>With the <hi>Ruſſes</hi> for ſeveral cauſes before mentioned: With the <hi>Tartars,</hi> (commonly call'd the <hi>Crim Tartars,</hi> diſtinct from thoſe in <hi>Aſia;</hi> theſe bordering upon <hi>Ruſſia</hi> and <hi>Poland)</hi> who make yearly Incurſions almoſt for prey and plunder; either as friends or enemies, all's one. Therefore the <hi>Tartars</hi> do not ſeek to conquer ſo much as to plunder <hi>Poland.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the greateſt Enemies are the <hi>Turks,</hi> ever ſince they got <hi>Walachia, Moldavia,</hi> and <hi>Tranſylvania,</hi> the Walls &amp; Bulwarks as it were of <hi>Poland,</hi> and alſo the Tartars to be ſubject to them.

But they have yet <hi>threatned</hi> more than <hi>done</hi> any thing; and little has paſſed, beſides conſultings and fears hitherto betwixt them.</p>
                     <p>The ſeditious and mutinous <hi>Coſſacks</hi> have done moſt miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief. One of the chief cauſes of their Rebellion was the great oppreſſion of the Natives, by the <hi>Jews,</hi> in all the Cuſtoms and Tributes almoſt of the Kingdom, granted to them by King <hi>Caſimir,</hi> and ever ſince poſſeſſed by them, by the means of <hi>Eſther</hi> a Jewiſh, in behalf of her Nation, who obtain'd great Priviledges for them.</p>
                     <p>And in the late fatal Confuſions of <hi>Poland,</hi> the <hi>Ruſſians</hi> again beſieged <hi>Smolensko,</hi> and ſeiz'd not only on it, but all <hi>Ukrain,</hi> or <hi>black Ruſſia,</hi> and great part of <hi>Lituania.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The occaſion whereof was, firſt, the Jeſuites taking away the <hi>Ruſſes</hi> Temples, and hindring the free Liberty of Religion to them. Next, the Nobles Tyranny over the Peaſants, killing them at their pleaſure. Hence inraged, they riſe up againſt their Maſters, kill the Jeſuites and Prieſts, call the Coſſacks and Tartars to their help, and mutual prey.</p>
                     <p>Theſe miſchiefs increaſed during the <hi>Poles</hi> diſſention about Election of a King, and had like to have ruin'd all <hi>Poland.</hi>

                     <p>1660. The War between Swede, and Pole confederate with <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> ended, and peace made; and <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> made abſolute over <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> 1663, and they ſwear to him again.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. The Power of the Nobles is exceeding great, and each ſingle Noble is as it were a ſingle King, and hath Soveraign power over his Slaves, even of Life and Death.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Nobles chooſe the King, and preſcribe what Laws they like.</p>

3. If any will not accept theſe Laws, they proclaim PI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ASTUS, <hi>i. e.</hi> they will go to the chooſing of ſome Ruſtick, or plain Country-man of their own Nation.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. There are perpetual ſtrifes between the Nobles, and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators, or Council. The Senators favour the King, the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles the Kingdom.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. There is a like power of all the Nobles, ſo that one diſſenting, the other Suffrages are void; and one only Noble hath right to intercede in the Diet, or Parliament, againſt all, and to plead the Cauſe.</p>
                     <p>When all the reſt had given their conſent, a Noble ſtands up once and ſaid, <hi>I do not conſent.</hi> Being asked his Reaſon; ſayes, <hi>Becauſe I am a Noble:</hi> Nor did they reckon the Decree good, till they had his Conſent.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. In the Parliament or Diet of <hi>Poland,</hi> the Deputies of the Nobility, and the publick Liberty, (call'd <hi>Land-Nuncio's,</hi> or <hi>Meſſengers)</hi> to plead ſtrongly their Cauſe againſt the King and Senators of the Kingdom, are of greateſt Authority. For the Nobles are alwayes afraid leſt they ſhould loſe their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges to the King, which are ſo great.</p>
                     <p>Next for the Competitors Eligible, know,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, that though the Kingdom be Elective, yet they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver paſt by the Kings Family to chooſe others; but when the Line fails, then they ſeek ſtrangers, and grievous Factions ariſe before they can agree.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The Competitors have been (1.) the <hi>Moſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite,</hi> becauſe of the ſame Language, and Nation originally, and Neighbourhood. (2.) The <hi>Crim Tartar,</hi> urging that He is powerful, and able to bring an hundred thouſand Horſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Field; That he is hardy, and can live at a low rate; That as for Religion, ſo controverted and diſputed in <hi>Poland</hi> with ſuch Commotions, he will not ſtand for that, they ſhall have what they will: <hi>Thy Luther,</hi> ſays he, <hi>My Luther; Thy Pope, my Pope,</hi> as once in his Ambaſſadors Letters Credentials he

(3.) The Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> ſpecially ſince one Faction choſe the Archduke <hi>Maximilian:</hi> but the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing, the King of Swedes Son by the King of Polands Siſter; yet <hi>Maximilian</hi> reſerv'd both right and title. (4.) The King of <hi>France,</hi> ever ſince <hi>Charles the</hi> 9<hi>ths</hi> time, when they choſe his Brother the Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> afterwards King of <hi>France.</hi> Ever ſince which the French have alwayes cheriſhed ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty againſt the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> and Emperor; ſpecially after that the laſt King but this, <hi>viz. Uladiſlaus,</hi> fetch'd his Wife out of <hi>France,</hi> marrying the Dutcheſs of <hi>Nevers,</hi> whom this K. <hi>Caſimir</hi> his Brother, alſo married after his death. (5.) Of late there alſo was great endeavours (and underhand) for the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi>'s Son, Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> after this Kings death, or ſome other addicted to the French. But this diſtaſted the Nobles and would not do.</p>
                     <p>But ſince the Reſignation of the Crown, the preſent Stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers for it are the <hi>Moſcovit</hi>'s Son, who will turn <hi>Romaniſt,</hi> and makes fair promiſes for it. The Duke of <hi>Newburgh,</hi> or <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi> whom the King of <hi>France</hi> endeavours to promote; and the Emperor and other Princes put in for others. But all lies in the will and pleaſure of the Nobles, as they can agree.</p>
                     <p>The preſent king <hi>Caſimir</hi> is above threeſcore years old, and beſides his age and the ordinary cares of a Crown, has never had one peaceable moment; but perpetual troubles all his dayes, either with the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> or <hi>Tartars,</hi> or the <hi>Moſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites,</hi> or the <hi>Swedes,</hi> or the Confederates; So that he has had reaſon enough to be at laſt weary of a Crown in his old days, and to reſt; And indeed layes it down not without honour, having firſt reduced the Confederates, and ſetled affairs, elſe had done it ſooner, leſt it ſhould be thought he did it by force, and becauſe he could keep it no longer, rather than choiſe; and rather outed of it, than voluntarily left it.</p>

Note, that theſe <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> ſo often mentioned, inhabit the Eaſtern parts of <hi>Poland</hi> towards the <hi>Ruſſes</hi> and <hi>Tartars,</hi> and made but one Body under their General <hi>Chimilnisky,</hi> who ſome years ago made a great noiſe in the World; But were of late divided into three Bands, whereof one adheres to the <hi>Moſcovite,</hi> the other to the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> and a third contend for Liberty under the Orders of their General <hi>Tetera;</hi> Beſide the Army of the Confederates that was, but now diſſolved.</p>
                     <p>By all which it appears that <hi>Poland</hi> has declined much. 1. By the loſs of <hi>Walachia</hi> and <hi>Moldavia</hi> to the Turks. 2.

The utter root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out preſently thereupon the <hi>Moors</hi> and <hi>Saracens</hi> from the kingdom of <hi>Andaluſia;</hi> (who had held <hi>Spain</hi> more or leſs in ſubjection for ſeven hundred years) <hi>Anno</hi> 1492. Upon which they preſum'd to ſtile themſelves <hi>King and Queen of Spain,</hi> i. e. all <hi>Spain)</hi> to the prejudice of <hi>Navarre</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> who were yet diſtinct Kingdoms. (3.) The ſeizing on the kingdom of <hi>Navarre,</hi> whereto belonged <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi> &amp;c. (4.) The diſcovery of the New World, <hi>America,</hi> the year 1492. After which they had the title of <hi>Catholick</hi> by the Pope, to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of all other Kingdoms. (5.) The marrying of their only Daughter and Heir to <hi>Philip</hi> the Emperors Son, Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> Prince of the Netherlands, thereby uniting thoſe great Eſtates; and laying the Foundation alſo for the preſent <hi>Auſtrian</hi> Greatneſs and Family, continued ever ſince, by ſo many intermarriages, between the Spaniſh and Imperial branches of that potent Family.</p>
                     <p>And thus the Spaniards firſt became conſiderable in the World, and a Terror to Neighbours; and ſuddenly look'd like the beginners of a fifth, or Univerſal Monarchy of the World, at leaſt the New-World:</p>
                     <p>Which they affected, firſt, in Title, Getting (1.) that of Catholick Kings, after they had uſurped that of Kings of <hi>Spain;</hi> as deſigned by the Pope for Univerſal or Catholick

Monarch, to promote the Catholick Cauſe on Religion; to root out Hereticks, &amp;c. which has been alwayes their pretext, and which they have been alwayes zealous and mighty ſtick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers for. And (2) they have hereby claimed prerogative over all other Kings, and by pretext of their Title, have ever ſince look'd on themſelves as the Greateſt Monarchs of all the World; as indeed they had the greateſt Dominions. And this would have been a fair ſtep to be the Head of Kingdoms, as the Pope was of the Church. And juſt ſuch beginnings had the Pope himſelf over all other Biſhops.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, by Arms. For there remained two kingdoms in <hi>Spain: Portugal</hi> and <hi>Navarre<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> both which they ſeize on. Firſt that of <hi>Navarre,</hi> and <hi>Naples,</hi> &amp;c. Whence perpetuall Wars ever ſince with <hi>France</hi> in <hi>Catalonia,</hi> &amp;c. For this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which ſtill retains the Title, and by Arms continually requires the poſſeſſion. And then of <hi>Portugal</hi> by <hi>Philip the</hi> 2<hi>d,</hi> about ſixty years after, <hi>viz.</hi> about the 1560.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, by Shipping and Sea-Forces, or Power at Sea; ſpecially afterwards with their Invincible Armado in 88, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in were above thirty thouſand Souldiers, to joyn with as many out of the <hi>Netherlands.</hi> And again afterwards with as great Preparation againſt the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> (but to as little purpoſe too) in the year 1640; aiming at Superiority and Dominion of the Northern Seas, and conſequently of all the World. But the <hi>Hollanders</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> were grown, by that time of the World, too big to do any good on them.</p>

                     <p n="5">5. Which mighty Monarchy, labouring with its own weight, ſoon began to fall into peeces; (1) through exhauſting of its people, and want of men by naval expeditions into both <hi>Indies;</hi> by many and long Wars; by ejecting the <hi>Moors</hi> and <hi>Jews</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore &amp; afterwards, &amp;c. by the Spaniſh Inquiſition and grievous Taxes and oppreſſions of the Countrymen, and labourers.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:40863:46"/>
(2) By waſting of its Riches and Wealth; by Wars, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence. (3) By loſs of kingdoms and Provinces, as well as great defeats of its Armies, and <hi>Armado's.</hi> As namely the loſs of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> the Defeat in 88, the long Wars with the French, (who alwayes oppoſ'd this riſing Monarchy on all ſides) which brought laſtly the revolt of <hi>Portugal</hi> and <hi>Catalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia;</hi> and ſo the loſs of half their entire united Monarchy; beſides the new conqueſts in <hi>Flanders,</hi> the laſt year, by the <hi>French;</hi> all which have made pretty wide gaps in thoſe nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſwelling titles.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. But this great Kingdom was chiefly impair'd by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> and <hi>Portugal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For this <hi>Philip</hi> in indeavouring to bring Tyrannick Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment both Civil and Religious, ſpecially the laſt; by the blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Inquiſition; and to reduce them back a gain by force to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> from that Reformation of Religion, which was now every where begun (whereof he was a violent Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;) was by a great part of the Provinces confederate toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, rejected from being their Prince, <hi>An.</hi> 1581. for ſeeing the Spaniards would bring in abſolute domination, both over Soul and Body, they became deſperate, to the death, declare him for a Tyrant, and perpetual Enemy; and by eighty years Wars brought the Spaniard to an open confeſſion or convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his bad Politicks, for Force of Religion; and taught them, and the World too, if they will be taught, this Rule, <hi>That a free Nation muſt be governed freely.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the Pride and Tyranny, ſpecially in Religion, and the unmerciful Inquiſition, fill'd all Chriſtian People, with Hate and Terror of the Spaniards; ſpecially theſe moſt concern'd. For by no more powerful argument did the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> inflame the Netherlanders Spirits, than ſaying, That <hi>Theſe burn men alive for Religion;</hi> which ſet them all on fire.</p>
                     <p>So ill does Force upon either mens Civil or Religious Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, conduce to eſtabliſh Princes, where Subjects are once ſenſible of them.</p>

And that Religion had a chief hand in theſe Revolutions, you muſt know that the main deſign then driven on by the Catholick Princes and Party, was the defence and propagation of that Religion, the Protector whereof the King of <hi>Spain</hi> vaunted to be, and the extirpation of Hereticks, and ſo to make the King of <hi>Spain</hi> Univerſal and abſolute, and truly and indeed Catholick, (at leaſt by ſome, &amp;c.)</p>
                     <p>In ſuch ſort, that about 1560, <hi>Charles the</hi> 9<hi>th,</hi> king of <hi>France,</hi> with the Queen-Mother <hi>Katherine</hi> of <hi>Medices</hi> (a buſie and Imperious Queen) and <hi>Iſabel</hi> this king of <hi>Spains</hi> Wife, and the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> make a league, to joyne the Power and Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of both Nations, to root out the new increaſing Hereticks; The <hi>Hugonots</hi> out of <hi>France,</hi> and the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> out of the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> and <hi>Germany;</hi> and immediately enſued the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly League</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> (wherein this King was a mighty ſtickler alſo) and then thoſe wars here.</p>
                     <p>So that he not only confederated with the <hi>Leaguiſts</hi> againſt the <hi>Hugonots;</hi> but alſo about the year 1580, (when the other would not do) endeavours alſo, upon the ſame account, to hinder the Reformation growing in his own Dominions, by bringing in the Inquiſition and arbitrary Government amongſt them, whereby he was wholly driven out of thoſe Provinces, confederating together for their Liberty and Priviledges.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And indeed, except mens Civil Liberties be firſt invaded, their Religious can hardly be.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To recover which Countries, they exhauſted all their ſtrength in vain for eighty years, till they were at laſt forc'd to a ſhameful ſubmiſſion in the Treary of <hi>Munſter</hi> 1648. therein renouncing for ever all Right, &amp;c. and treat with them and their Embaſſadors, as free and abſolute Soveraign Eſtates.</p>
                     <p>For by this time they had other Bones, that touch'd them nearer, to pick, and a greater Enemy to deal with; and a worſe and nearer Neighbour, which occaſioned the defection of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi> and <hi>Catalonia.</hi>

                     <p>The Great Dukedom of <hi>Tuſcany</hi> was anciently a Free-State: but never any more turbulent with Factions, and ſeveral forms of Government in the State; and moſt commonly between the Nobles and Commons: till at laſt when there was no end of theſe Contentions, the People prevailed againſt the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</p>

                     <p>His Son by the ſame moderation and favour of the people, (which yet continued,) obtained in like manner the principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, notwithſtanding all the oppoſition of the Nobles; to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs which, took up all his Son and ſucceſſors time alſo.</p>

And afterwards ſo proſpered and ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that before they would hearken to any treaty or accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, they forc'd the Spaniard to this concluſion, to treat with them as a Free-State, in the year 1609. and then made a twelve years truce only. And 1621. renew the War again, but not ſo hot as at firſt, &amp;c. till the Treaty of <hi>Munſter</hi> 1648. whereby the Spaniard renounces all pretenſions for ever, and acknowledges them for a Free-State<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; only dependant on God. A War ſo ſhamefully begun, and (after fourſcore years) ſo ſhamefully ended; in a Glorious and Eternal Peace made with them for ever.</p>
                     <p>Liberty of Religion, according to the Laws of their firſt Union at <hi>Utrecht</hi> 1579, was the foundation, and has been, and is, the preſervation of this Commonwealth.</p>
                     <p>The Reformed Religion <hi>Proteſtant</hi> (or <hi>Calvins)</hi> was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly eſtabliſhed.

                     <p>Though the War was Civil, and for their Civil rights direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, (as knowing well they could not violate and invade their Religious, without violating and invading theſe firſt) yet the end, motive, and occaſion principally was Religion, (and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that account, and indirectly Religious) on both ſides. Zeal for Religion on both ſides, moved both to contend for their pretended civil rights and claims. And ſo 'twas not a War for Religion, but as they ſay, a Defenſive War only, for their Civil Rights and Liberties, though in order, &amp; ſubſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency to Religion.

                     <p>Firſt three Ruſticks or chief Country men made a League amongſt themſelves of expelling Tyrants, whereof each brought his Town or Village into Society. The reſt came by degrees afterward ſucceſſively; til in the end after two hundred years from the firſt beginning of their League, to the finiſhing

them, they amounted to the preſent number of thirteen <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons,</hi> or diſtinct Parts and Corporations. Beſides ſeveral other Towns &amp; States, without the bounds of their Commonwealth, alſo joyn'd and comparted together with them, for common defence and ſafety.</p>
                     <p>And becoming Invincible in innumerable Battels and Victories at the firſt, forreign Enemies durſt never attempt them more. But ſince, frequent Civil Wars amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; but never to break their firſt Confederacy, but ſtill friends again.</p>
                     <p>Their Confederacy and Liberty was confirmed and allowed afterwards by the Emperor, <hi>Lewis</hi> the fourth, of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> for adhering to him againſt the faction of <hi>Auſtria</hi> for the Empire at the ſame time.</p>
                     <p>After their forementioned Victories, and Valour ſhewn in thoſe Battels &amp; Wars eminently, becoming renowned for Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, the French King takes them into penſion in his Wars, (who became likewiſe a member of their Corporation) which being afterward denied, they ſerve the Pope, who ſtiled them <hi>Defenders of the Church, An.</hi> 1510. The King of <hi>France</hi> thinks it beſt to take them again into penſion, 1522. upon very ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious terms to themſelves, and as burdenſome to him. They became Mercenary alſo to other Princes. Any might have them for their Mony. Hence reproached for a Mercenary Nation, truſted by none. But the King of <hi>France</hi> bid higheſt for them. And at this day they are in all Armies and Wars.</p>
                     <p>Since that agreement, they obtained alſo ſixteen hundred to be of the French Gaurd; the King preferring them for their Fame and Renown.

French King; who magnificently received them; and things compoſed, &amp;c. An Army conſiſting of <hi>Swiſſe</hi> Foot, and French Horſe; is accounted of all the moſt excellent.</p>
                     <p>About 1516. <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> a Canon of the Church, begins the Reformation of Religion here at <hi>Zurich,</hi> as <hi>Luther</hi> had before with good ſucceſs in <hi>Germany.</hi> Whom followed thoſe of <hi>Bern</hi> and <hi>Baſil,</hi> &amp;c.

                     </p>
                     <p>So that now this Common-wealth became divided into two factions, and thence broke out into cruel Wars, between <hi>Zu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich</hi> and the Romiſh <hi>Cantons.</hi> The Proteſtants at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning are worſted. <hi>Zuinglius</hi> himſelf Slain in the head of the Battel, 1531; his heart remaining whole (like <hi>Cranmers)</hi> in the midſt of the Fire, untouched, as is ſaid, after all the reſt conſumed to Aſhes.</p>
                     <p>At laſt after various ſucceſſes and defeats on both ſides, they agree the buſineſs upon this condition, That every one ſhould imbrace what Religion they liked, and force be offer'd to none for Religion: but that the ancient firſt League ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violably and religiouſly kept and obſerved. And ſo indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing each other the free exerciſe of their Religion, they break not League for that matter, nor ever have to this day, till late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; notwithſtanding any Civil Wars of Religion or State, that have ſince happened. Being it ſeems pretty equally poiz'd and ballanced on both ſides.</p>
                     <p>But here it will not be amiſs to note that theſe two, <hi>Zuinglius</hi> and <hi>Luther,</hi> went two ſeveral waies, ſpecially in point of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation, or real preſence.</p>
                     <p>Hence the Proteſtants became divided in <hi>Germany</hi> into <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans</hi> and <hi>Zuinglians,</hi> afterwards called <hi>Reformed.</hi> And the Names of <hi>Ubiquitarians</hi> and <hi>Sacramentarians</hi> every where
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:40863:55"/>
break forth, as has been hinted before, under <hi>Germany,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Calvin</hi> afterwards riſing in the place and ſtead of <hi>Zuinglius</hi> at <hi>Geneva,</hi> added ſome Tenents about Predeſtination, Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, Univerſall Grace, and Perſeverance in Faith, which further heightened and aggravated the Differences betwixt them.</p>
                     <p>About theſe aroſe afterwards in <hi>Holland</hi> great contentions with the <hi>Arminians,</hi> which cauſed the General Synod at <hi>Dort</hi> againſt them, <hi>An.</hi> 1618. &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>But to return to <hi>Germany.</hi> Between theſe two Religions of the Proteſtants aroſe grievous diſcords, not only Theological but Political. For that many would exclude the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> or Reform'd, from the Peace of Religion agreed on at firſt by the Auguſtian Confeſſion at <hi>Ausburgh,</hi> and baniſh them out of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.</hi> Whence thoſe violent Tumults of <hi>Ausburg</hi> in the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, or Meetings of the States, againſt the Elector Palatine 1560. and again againſt the ſucceeding Palatine Elector, 1590. and of <hi>Lipſia</hi> and <hi>Brunſwick,</hi> 1595. And this might be one reaſon perhaps of the Elector, the Duke of <hi>Saxony's</hi> ſiding at firſt with the Emperour againſt the <hi>Palatine,</hi> in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemian-German Wars, about the year 1619. the Palatine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing head of the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> or Reform'd, and then alſo the chief of the Electoral Princes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> of the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans.</hi> But afterwards fearing the Emperors prevailing and greatneſs, (who had ejected the Palatine) and the coming in thereupon of <hi>Guſtavus Adolphus</hi> in defence of the German Princes Liberties, the Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> convocates all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Princes at <hi>Lipſia, an.</hi> 1630. where they concluded of a defenſive League againſt the Emperor and Imperialiſts, and that Liberty was to be propagated and maintained by Arms. But after the King of <hi>Swedes</hi> death, &amp;c. he deſerts them, and by himſelf alone injuriouſly agrees with the Emperor againſt the <hi>Swede</hi> and the reſt, &amp;c.

In the end at the concluſion of theſe Wars of <hi>Germany</hi> by <hi>Munſter</hi> Treaty. 1648. This Political differance was reconcil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and they agreed and united into one common name of the <hi>Auguſtan</hi> Confeſſion at firſt made, in the beginning of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, as aforeſaid. The Theological differance ever ſince, both Princes and Divines at this day labour hard to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; and 'tis hoped that a bridle will be put upon the Tongues and Pens of the Paſtors and Profeſſors, that they do not condemn, but tolerate one another mutually, and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily diſpute their controverſies amongſt themſelves. In <hi>France</hi> they have of late proceeded ſo far, as to allow and embrace communion with them, and in their Churches and Sacraments; (if they will) which made the Friers and Jeſuites write, that they might as well hold communion with them, and be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> for that the <hi>Conſubſtantiarians</hi> was as far from the <hi>Sacramentarians,</hi> as the <hi>Tranſubſtantiarions:</hi> but ſufficiently anſwered. Yet the <hi>Swedes</hi> have this preſent year lately decreed and enacted by Law, for all to loſe their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive freedom, that ſhall bring up their children in any other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, then the Lutheran.

                     </p>
                     <p>This concord of Religion then made between them, laſted till 1654, when a new War kindled amongſt them again, for Religion, and the Proteſtants cruelly Murthered and Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd. For when ſome Families of the Canton of <hi>Switzers,</hi> and other Cantons had embraced the Goſpel, they cruelly put them to Death. This thoſe of <hi>Zurick,</hi> and <hi>Berne</hi> would not ſuffer. After long conteſtation, at laſt they come to Arms; and fierce War begins betwen thoſe of <hi>Zurick</hi> and <hi>Lucern,</hi> till at laſt the French King interpoſing (and <hi>England)</hi> this War was compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the ſame year; and the civil commotions for Religion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, preſently ended; the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> likewiſe not only then, but ſince perſecuted the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> as there has bin hinted, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>

commands all Proteſtant, Lutheran, or Reformed, out of his Dominions. The Elector of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> by way of retortion, in like manner, commands all Papiſts out of his. This ſhould have been noted there.</p>

                     <p>The terrible noiſe of the <hi>Huns</hi> for the Conqueſt of <hi>Italy,</hi> and their expedition under <hi>Attila</hi> their King, occaſioned many Noble and Principal Families with their ſeveral retinues, to betake themſelves to theſe ſmall Iſlands and inacceſſible Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes of the <hi>Adriatick Sea;</hi> where they build for the time only, ſeveral habitations, <hi>An.</hi> 421. and finding themſelves ſafe and impregnable began to build Towns, and Cities, or Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. <hi>An.</hi> 452. Till in the end, <hi>Aquileja</hi> and the neighbouring Cities being deſtroyed by <hi>Aquila,</hi> and theſe Barbarians, <hi>An.</hi> 456, they then fled from all parts like Exiles hither, with a purpoſe and reſolution to ſettle; and ſo by the deſtruction of <hi>Aquileja</hi> takes ſuch increaſe, that it aſſumed the juſt form of a Commonwealth. For whom ſoever the <hi>Hunnes, Goths,</hi> and <hi>Lombards</hi> (the Nations that haraſs'd <hi>Italy)</hi> drove from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, they preſently betake themſelves to <hi>Venice,</hi> (now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to be ſo called, from the name of their Nation) as to an Haven of ſecurity.</p>
                     <p>They had firſt yearly Tribunes, according to the number of Iſlands into which their City was divided, for two hundred years. then ſucceeded Dukes, <hi>An.</hi> 697. but ſoon after chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into yearly Maſters of the Militia, which laſted but Six years, and returns to Dukes again; whoſe power at firſt was greater; but afterwards reſtrained to be meerly Titular.</p>
                     <p>Under this form it thriv'd exceedingly, and became ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from all Jurisdiction, either to the Eaſt, or Weſt Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:40863:58"/>
upon the diviſion of <hi>Italy</hi> made by <hi>Charles</hi> the great, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt himſelf, the Popes and the Eaſtern Emperor, and left wholly as a free State acknowledging no ſuperior. For <hi>Pepin</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> Father of <hi>Charles,</hi> had invaded them, with a puiſſant Army, but was beat.</p>
                     <p>They then extend their Empire far and near by Sea and Land, through <hi>Dalmatia, An.</hi> 990. and become freed from all Tribute to the Conſtantinopolitan Emperor of the Eaſt; from whom at length they obtained it, and <hi>Croatia</hi> in full right. Afterwards <hi>Corfu</hi> and <hi>Chius,</hi> Iſlands. And from that time cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led themſelves Lords of all the <hi>Adriatick</hi> Sea; and that right confirmed by the Pope; <hi>An.</hi> 1177. for defending the Church ſtoutly againſt the Emperor. And from that time marry the Sea yearly with a Ring.</p>
                     <p>It got its greateſt increaſe about <hi>An.</hi> 1204. by the chief Iſlands of the <hi>Mediterranean Sea, Candy</hi> and divers other Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, And then ſpread it's Empire through the Continent of <hi>Italy,</hi> under pretext of freeing the Cities from Tyrants, and upon the diſtreſſes of their Neighbours for their aſſiſtance, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>An.</hi> 1207. The Genoeſe, a State grown powerful by Sea, contend with them for Soveraignty of the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> by ſeven ſeveral Wars in order; vanquiſhed their fleet, and brought them on their knees, in ſo much that the Senate ſent them a blank Charter, and bid them write what conditions they pleaſed. And had utterly loſt all if the Enemy could have uſed his fortune with moderation. But the <hi>Genoeſe</hi> Admiral grown proud of his advantage, and inſolent with this great ſucceſs would have the City wholly at his diſpoſal: which made the City deſperate, and venturing laſt Stakes, beat them, purſue them Home, and utterly cruſhed them for ever after. For after many various ſucceſſes and events of War on both ſides, they got, <hi>An.</hi> 1381. the better of them abſolutely, &amp; made them quiet, never daring afterwards to contend in War, but apply themſelvs wholly to Gain and Merchandize. Which
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:40863:58"/>
misfortunes were occaſioned principally by their own diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and endleſs factions, at Home, as ſhall be touched on afterwards.</p>
                     <p>Being now Lords Paramount at Sea, they increaſe amain by Land, (as even now hinted) through the factions and diviſions of their Neighbouring States; whereby one piece or other is ſtill added, either Sold or Morgaged, or given, for their aſſiſtance. And ſo became poſſeſſed of innumerable places belonging to the Empire, the Pope, <hi>Milan,</hi> and Kingdom of <hi>Naples;</hi> working their greatneſs out of others ruines; which ſordid kind of Merchandiſe drew all the Princes of theſe parts afterwards to make War upon them, every one to recover by ſtrong hand, what they had extorted from them in their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity.</p>
                     <p>Being therefore arrived to their greateſt height and power, after mighty Tempeſt of War, they begin to decline from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the year, 1500. For now all Europe conſpired to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh this Commonwealth: the Pope being chief Author. A League then is made between the Pope; Emperour, King of <hi>France,</hi> King of <hi>Spain,</hi> (wherein leſſer Princes joyn'd) at <hi>Cambray</hi> in the Netherlands, <hi>An.</hi> 1508. So ſecret and private, that they were oppreſſed before they underſtood it; and ſo were whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly almoſt overcome, and ſcarce had any thing left but their City; fell down at <hi>Caeſar's</hi> feet, and cry Peccavi. By which ſubmiſſion they out-live this confederacy, to ſee it deſolved; and thereupon eaſily recover again from each ſingle, what they had loſt to all; ſave <hi>Naples</hi> only. And have ever ſince thought it their wiſeſt courſe not to conquer, but to keep; and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Mediators and Reconcilers, rather then Medlers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween differing Princes; And by privy Leagues, rather then open Wars do defend themſelves againſt the Emperor, and Houſe of <hi>Auſtria.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Their lateſt Enemies, and of this age have been the Pope, the Emperor, and above all the Turk. The Pope <hi>An.</hi> 1605.

excommunicates the Commonwealth of <hi>Venice</hi> (1) Becauſe they would exclude all Eccleſiaſticks from Government (2) becauſe they would pay no penſion to the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and though good Catholicks, yet little cared for the Pope.</p>
                     <p>The occaſion was the difference between the State and the Churchmen. The Pope defended the Churchmen: and the <hi>Venetians</hi> their Laws, and the right of Majeſty. They arm againſt the Pope<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the French and Spaniard ſtand lookers on; the French to quench, and the Spaniards to inflame the Fire. Only the Hollanders bring help to the State. And at laſt end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Popes ridiculous War, but with perpetuall Baniſhment of the Jeſuites, for adhereing to the Pope, and would by no means be intreated to tolerate them in their Territories; till ten years ſince through neceſſities of the <hi>Turks</hi> Wars, and for favour of the late Pope, they were reſtored again, but on ſtrict conditions, &amp;c. Theſe Jeſuites were once alſo expell'd out of <hi>France;</hi> for King-killing Documents, and practiſes: but ſoon cunningly worked themſelves in again there.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>An.</hi> 1616, There was War between the <hi>Venetians</hi> and the <hi>Auſtrians.</hi> But the <hi>Holanders</hi> helping them, Peace was ſoon made. The occaſion was about ſome Rights in <hi>Iſtria</hi> and <hi>Friuli,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>An.</hi> 1645.

                     <p>They were anciently a large and flouriſhing Common-wealth; getting their liberty out of the diviſions of <hi>Italy,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſeveral Lords and Maſters: and were too potent for the <hi>Venetians,</hi> as before hinted: But through their own diviſions and factions, at length looſe almoſt all their eſtates, to Potent Neighbours, and enemies. The City being (miſerably) torn in pieces by endleſs and perpetual factions.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Berengarij,</hi> as Kings of <hi>Italy</hi> oppoſit to the Emperor, made them free, <hi>An.</hi> 899. And firſt under Governors till 1100. Then Conſuls to 1194. then Mayors. And then added Governors of the People to them, &amp;c. with wonderful fluctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and inconſtancy, through the multitude of factions, &amp;c. At laſt to alay the factions between the Nobles and Commons, a Duke was created by the people (for every two years,) of the Nobility, or the Commons, <hi>An.</hi> 1327.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe factions were firſt between the <hi>Dorij</hi> and <hi>Spinoli,</hi> on one ſide, and the <hi>Fliſchi</hi> and <hi>Grimaldi</hi> on the other. About 1174. Next of the <hi>Negri</hi> and <hi>Mollani,</hi> againſt the <hi>Salvatici</hi> and <hi>Embriam,</hi> about 1289. and laſtly frequently between the Nobles and Commons; which brought them to this foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Government.</p>
                     <p>Which factions did ſo weaken them at home and abroad,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:40863:60"/>
that they became of far leſs reputation and authority then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently. For this great City Commanded the Ocean, and all the affairs of <hi>Italy,</hi> in a manner once. And brought the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> under, to their laſt gaſp as it were, but through theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions loſt almoſt all their large Eſtates, and reduced to that narrow compaſs, they have now at preſent. For neither did their factions change or ceaſe with their Governments.</p>
                     <p>This Government by Dukes continued (yet not without Parties ſtill, as between the Spinoli and Dorij themſelves, <hi>An.</hi> 1336. and the Nobility and Commons 1339. and the <hi>Guelfi</hi> and <hi>Gibellines,</hi> &amp;c.) till the <hi>French</hi> were called in by the <hi>Guel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fian</hi> faction, About <hi>An.</hi> 1390. for they were ſo broken, that they were feign to put themſelves under the protection of Neighbours, to defend that little they had left. And ſo they deliver themſelves up to the King of <hi>France.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Afterwards, <hi>An.</hi> 1403. they put themſelves under the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the Dukes of <hi>Milan,</hi> which were ſometimes under the obedience of the French, ſometimes of the Spaniard.</p>
                     <p>But after many changes and alterations of this kind, they are at length reſtored to liberty from the Empire of the <hi>French,</hi> by <hi>Charles the fifth, An.</hi> 1522. and the New form of Government inſtituted by <hi>Andrea Dori, An.</hi> 1528. called therefore, Father of their Country; and Dukes are created eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry two years by lot. This laſted till 1574.</p>
                     <p>When diſſentions aroſe between the Nobles and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, but compoſed by the Emperor, King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Pope.</p>
                     <p>But not being able to preſerve their freedom reſtored ſo to them; they finally put themſelves under <hi>Spain,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes their Protector; and thereupon, all occaſions of War borrows Mony of them upon uſe; by which, and by their Trade with <hi>Spain,</hi> they have exceedingly thriven, &amp; grown exceſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rich; contenting themſelves only with Riches and Trade, without aiming at Dominion: And though far inferior to the

                     <p>But not finding themſelves able to maintain it, they put themſelves under the protection of their potent Neighbours, changing their patrons, as moſt conduced to their preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

                     <p>The Papal Power, and Principallity, is either Spiritual, or Univerſal Biſhop, Infallible Judge of Truth, with univerſal power of Excommunication, that is, as ſupreame Head of the Catholick, or Univerſal Church: (at firſt founded upon Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral power and greatneſs, and upheald by it, as well as Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual prerogatives, previledges, and power.

This Dominion and Kingdom thus mixt, is either imperfect, and limited<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as what he hath in and over other Ringdoms, (the Clergy ſpecially) Being Head of their Church in their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms: or perfect, abſolute and Sovereign<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as any other Temporal Prince over their Subjects, as in the Eſtates and Lands of the Church in <hi>Italy,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The foundation, and likewiſe Superſtructure of this Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Principallity (conſiſting of ſuch twofold power,) was firſt laid, and then built and perfected by the working of the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of Iniquity, gradually.

                     <p n="1">(1.) There was firſt diſtinction of Clergy and Laity. (2.) diſtinction, degrees, and dignities of Clergy, for order and unity, to avoid ſchiſme, and factions. (3.) Theſe degrees, dignities, and diſtinctions of offices in the Church, ſuited and proportioned very much, to thoſe in State, and thoſe Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent on the ſtate, thereby ſetting up <hi>Imperium</hi> in <hi>Imperio,</hi> or a Government in Government. (4.) Contending for preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, priority, precedency, &amp; ſupremacy in the ſeveral Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and Governments. (5.)

                     <p>The ſpiritual ſupremacy began by Pope <hi>Boniface,</hi> about <hi>An.</hi> 606. under the title of univerſal Biſhop, to which ſeveral things conduced. (1.) Firſt, Accommodating the Honours and Governments of the Church, to thoſe of the preſent ſtate, that is, of the Empire become Chriſtians; and ſo mixing Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and Temporal power, and ſetting up Empire in Empire,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:40863:62"/>
under <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, turn'd Chriſtian. For becauſe, they muſt needs acknowledge, according to that famous max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im amongſt them, that the Church was in the Commonwealth, not the Commonwealth in the Church; Therefore upon that foundation, the Fathers in the Council of <hi>Calcedon,</hi> raiſed this ſuperſtructure, that the Honours in the Church ſhould be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated unto thoſe in the State. From whence would eaſily follow, an Head of the Church, as well as of the Empire, at leaſt as far as the Empire reach.</p>
                     <p>Hereupon <hi>Conſtantine</hi> dividing the Empire into fourteen Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oceſſes, each Dioceſs into Provinces, and each Province into Cities, and placing in every Dioceſs a Vicegerent, or Viceroy, in every Province, a Preſident, and in every City, a Defendor, or Governor: the Church accordingly inſtitute, for every Vicegerent, a Primate, or Patriarch, in the principal City of the Dioceſs; for every Preſident, a Metropolitan, in the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis of the Province; and for every Governor, a Biſhop in every City, with permiſſion of the ſuperior Emperor; and then a Pope over all would follow of courſe naturally, for the Emperor himſelf, &amp;c. in the chief ſeat of the Empire.</p>
                     <p n="2">(2.) There was ſuiting Temporal means Tythes, Revenues, Riches, proportional to the Honours, Dignities, Degrees and Offices of Government in the Church, by the ſaid <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> which a Voice in the Air proclaimed to be a Peſt ſown in the Church.</p>
                     <p n="3">(3.) The Biſhop of Rome remained as yet, at leaſt account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the moſt Orthodox, and their Religion, as in the heart and center of the Empire, ſeemed moſt to flouriſh. Hence (1.) frequent appeals to this Church as the trueſt and beſt. (2.)

and all to ſubmit to the deciſion of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> at leaſt preſiding in Council.</p>

The Biſhop of <hi>Romes</hi> Seat, was the Seat or metropolis of the Empire, thereby gaining great authority, power, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, and no leſs fame, eſteem, and repute over all the World, &amp;c. But we can but hint things here in brief.</p>
                     <p n="5">(5.) The Empire began ſoon to be divided into the Eaſtern and Weſtern. Where upon the Eaſtern Biſhops contend for precedency and ſupremacy upon the removal of the Seat of Empire to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and the outward flouriſhing of that Church.</p>
                     <p n="6">(6.) At laſt upon the further breakings and weaknings of the Empire, he obtains of <hi>Phocas,</hi> killing the Emperor <hi>Mauri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> in a tumult of the Souldiers, the abſolute ſupremacy, and Title of Univerſal Biſhop, about 606. as aforeſaid.</p>
                     <p>In theſe contentions for this ſpiritual ſupremacy, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for their Title, and claim the donation or delegation of Chriſt thereto, the Succeſſion to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> the donation and Conſtitution of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> the firſt Chriſtian univerſal Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Having got the Supremacy of the Church in ſpirituals, the ſame myſtery of Iniquity works for Supremacy alſo in Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porals, over all Emperors, Kings, and Princes, and as it were univerſal Monarchy. For from univerſal Biſhop, clearly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows univerſal Excommunication, even of Emperors, Rings and Monarchs, afterwards practiſed. From Excommunicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, depoſing. From depoſing, diſpoſing of Ringdoms. From diſpoſing (to whom ſhould he be more kind then himſelf) Uſurping and poſſeſſing. So naturally one Wedge drives in and makes way for another; And having got in his head, caſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wriggles in his whole Body, &amp;c. Beſides the Church was to be preferred above the State, and the Head of the Church, above the Head of the State. And ſo the Spiritual Supremacy prepares and makes way for the Temporal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For there is no end
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:40863:63"/>
of Pride, and Ambition, ſo long as any equall or ſuperior; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he be above all that is called God, like <hi>Lucifer,</hi> who would be above God himſelf, and all Government or ſubjection. But we muſt not inſiſt.</p>
                     <p>As to this Temporal Power, Particulars of fact in brief lye thus; as well as we can obſerve things, as they fell out. Only firſt take notice the foundation of his ſpirituall Supremacy a little more particular, in the order of time.</p>
                     <p n="1">(1) By the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> in <hi>Conſtantines</hi> time, the four Patriarchs, of <hi>Rome,</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi> were all equal. (2) about the year 410. the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> would pretend to be the firſt Patriarch; and to that end falſifies the Canon, and ſends it to the Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> where it was rejected as falſe. (3) The Imperial Seat being tranſlated to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> the Biſhop thereof was made a fifth Patriarch in order, and not long after the ſecond, the reſt oppoſſing, &amp;c. in vain. (4) The Lombards overcoming <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and the Pope not well pleaſed with the Emperor, &amp;c. The Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> endeavours the Title of Univerſal Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhope, and obtains it of <hi>Mauritius</hi> the Emperor, the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> to the utmoſt oppoſing, and exclaiming againſt it, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable Pride, and the ſigne of antichriſt. And whether out of a good mind, or becauſe he could not be uppermoſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, laments the corruptions of the Church and Clergy. For of the Prieſts, he complains, the World is full of them, and yet but few Labours in the Lords Harveſt. We take upon us the office, but diſcharge it who liſt; And I think no diſhonour to God can be ſhewed ſo great, as that which it tolerated in Prieſts. For they are come now to that paſs, that they jear at him that lives humble, and continently, and takes better cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, then themſelves, which <hi>Mantuan</hi> verſifies on, to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,</p>

                     <p>The ſaid <hi>Gregory</hi> cryed out, <hi>O times, O manners! The world is all on fire with Wars; Chriſtians are deſtroyed by Idolaters; Cities and Temples, by Barbarians; and yet Prieſts, as it were, inſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting over Calamities; uſurp the names of vanity, and make oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of profane Titles to themſelves;</hi> thereby taxing this arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance of the Conſtantinopolitan Patriarch. (5) <hi>Phocas</hi> killing <hi>Mauritius,</hi> and invading the Empire, to oblige the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> to keep <hi>Italy</hi> the better in quiet and obedience; grants the dignitiy of Univerſal Biſhop to <hi>Boniface</hi> requeſting it, and decrees the Sea (or Seat) of <hi>Rome,</hi> to be the Head of all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. Which decrees <hi>Boniface</hi> publiſhes in a Synod of 62 Biſhops, and obtains it, not without oppoſition and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>After theſe things, the Eaſtren or Greek Church broke off from the Latine or Roman. <hi>Italy</hi> by ſeveral Maſters began to be quite pluck'd from the Empire, and <hi>Rome</hi> to come into the Popes power, and ſeveral Schiſms and Hereſies in the Church, and contentions and quarrels between Popes and Emperors thereupon, &amp;c. The Pope alienates the Romans, or people of <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> from the Emperor, brings them to oppoſe him, amidſt the troubles of <hi>Italy.</hi> And condemns Emperors of the Eaſt of Hereſie, and at laſt excommunicates them. And out of the ruines of <hi>Italy,</hi> works his own greatneſs, and by his means, and through his occaſion, a new Empire is ſet up in the Weſt, by the <hi>Franks,</hi> under <hi>Charles</hi> the Great: and great Temporal Power, and Dominion, and Eſtates, accrew'd to the Church; and the Pope at length claims ſuperiority above the Emperors themſelves, &amp;c. As the following particulars will manifeſt.</p>

                        <pb n="122" facs="tcp:40863:64"/>
After the Supremacy of the Pope thus eſtabliſhed, the Greeke Church in the Eaſt ſeperates from the Roman; not only for Primacy, but other high points of Religion; as was now ſaid.</p>
                     <p>About the year 710. aroſe the controverſie about Images. And about 726. the Pope excommunicates the Emperor for his Edct againſt Images, who laughs at it, and excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates him again for an Idolater; and forbids Revenues and Taxes to be paid in <hi>Italy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Upon theſe differences <hi>Italy</hi> is torn from the Empire by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Uſurpers, and <hi>Rome</hi> by the Pope, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>An.</hi> 712. Lands and Teritories are firſt conferr'd on the Church by ſome new Conquerors, And ſoon after more. And at laſt, moſt he now poſſeſſes, by <hi>Pepin,</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> the Great.</p>
                     <p>For about this time, <hi>Charles Martel Maire</hi> of the Kings Palace, recovers <hi>France</hi> from the Infidel <hi>Moors</hi> and <hi>Saracens;</hi> which drew the heart of the French towards him, creating him Duke or Prince of <hi>France;</hi> and might have had the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom too, if he had been ſo aſpiring.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Pepin</hi> his Son under colour of Election is made King; The lawful King having his Pole ſhaven, and feign to retire into a Monaſtery, the Pope approving theſe proceedings; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſting and confirming <hi>Pepin</hi> in the Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But the Pope being diſtreſſed in</hi> Italy, <hi>calls in</hi> Pepin <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, whom he had ſo obliged, to defend him, and the Church, in this Stile,</hi> Peter the Apoſtle of Jeſus Chriſt, to you the moſt Illuſtrious King <hi>Pepin,</hi> and to all Biſhops, Abbots, &amp;c. I the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> whoſe Adopted Sons you are, admoniſh you, that you perfectly come, and defend this City, &amp;c. And doubt you not, but truſt aſſuredly, that I my ſelf, as if I ſtood before you, do thus exhort you, &amp;c. and that I, <hi>Peter,</hi> the Apoſtle of God, will at the laſt day yeeld you mutual kindneſs, and prepare you Tabernacles in the Heavens.</p>
                     <p>Upon this quarel of the Popes, <hi>Pepin</hi> and his Son <hi>Charls</hi>
                        <pb n="123" facs="tcp:40863:64"/>
deſtroy the Kingdom of the <hi>Lombards</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> and give large Territories to the Church. And theſe things made way, and gave occaſion and opportunity, for <hi>Charles,</hi> upon his great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, to ſet up the <hi>German</hi> Empire of the Weſt Franks. The Pope in requital confirms <hi>Pepin</hi> in the Ringdom of <hi>France,</hi> gives his Son <hi>Charls</hi> afterwards the Title of moſt chriſtian King, and crowns him Emperor of the Romans, at <hi>Rome</hi> An. 800. From which he would pretend to be above Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and Kings, and to be his right to Crown, confirm, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them, if not diſpoſe of their Kingdoms.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Charls</hi> (at length) reaſſumes the ancient and original Imperial Dignity and Power, to Govern the Church, call Councils, and order Papal Elections, and confirm and inveſt them, &amp;c. againſt all begun uſurpations and incroachments of the Pope; and aws <hi>Italy;</hi> And keeps the Pope ſtill Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; which Authority of the Empire was prety well upheld, during the Caroline Race.</p>
                     <p>The Pope in the mean while under pretext of the Chriſtian Religion, and converting Infidels and the Nations, increaſes in Wealth, Power, and Authority over the World, Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out theſe Decrees of Holy Church; <hi>Out of the Church no Salvation. The Pope's the Succeſſor of St.</hi> Peter, <hi>the viſible Head of the Church, the Vicar of Chriſt on Earth. His right, as aforeſaid to create, confirm, excommunicate, and depoſe Kings, and diſpoſe Kingdoms for the cauſe of Religion, &amp;c. That they are He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks that diſſent from the Roman Church, the only true Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church; or are Enemies to it,</hi> &amp;c. Hereby the Conſciences of the Nations, Princes, and People, converted to an outward chriſtianity, are aw'd, and fill'd with Reverence, and Zeal for the Church; to convert, or root out Infidel Nations, &amp;c. and to do any Benefices, or Services for the Church; As the moſt acceptable Service to Chriſt, whom they began to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and Worſhip, as their God and Saviour.</p>
                     <p>Hence, almoſt all the Nations ſubject themſelves to the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:40863:65"/>
Pope, as Head of the Church, yea and in Temporals alſo in a great meaſure, nay ſome to hold their Kingdoms of him, &amp;c. As if they could not any better way recompence Chriſts Vicar, for the benefit of their Eternal Salvation, then to ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs, &amp; all theirs to his diſpoſe. And this Opinion was brought about to prevail in the World, that they might redeem their ſins by good deeds and charitable works and ſervices, for the Church againſt it's enemies, &amp;c. Hence Riches, and Revenues of the Clergy, and Hoſts and ſwarms of clergy men. Hence Churches, Temples, Abbies, Monaſtries without number, &amp;c. for the Redemtion of Souls. Hence Expeditions, Holy Wars, Leagues and undertakings for the Church. Hence Pardons, Indulgences, and devices for mony, &amp;c. 'Twould be endleſs to mention particulars, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The Pope having thus erected his Throne in the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of men, &amp; ſtrongly ſeated there, through Ignorance and blind Zeal and Devotion, begins to play Rex in the World.</p>
                     <p>Beſides there being perpetual emulation of Princes, ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> for Empire and Dominion, &amp;c. The Pope intereſts himſelf in one part, and the other for fear of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, or force, becomes ſubject to him.</p>
                     <p>The Pope therefore now practiſes all wayes he can againſt the ſuperiority of the Emperor, and from being any wayes ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to his Authority, or control and to undermine all Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy in Temporals, preſuming that all power is given to him, both in Heaven and Earth, in the Church and State, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>'Till in the end, they come not only to let the Emperors have nothing to do, in their Election, Confirmation, and Inveſtiture; but alſo to have all in a manner themſelves to do, in the Creation and Coronation of the Emperors.</p>
                     <p>Not long after the <hi>Caroline power</hi> and <hi>race</hi> declining, and that partly through the Popes practiſes, <hi>Italy</hi> is uſurp'd by ſeveral Tyrants againſt the Emperor, and almoſt wholly broken from
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:40863:65"/>
it; wherein the Popes have a finger, and make their own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage upon theſe diſtractions of the Empire.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>An.</hi> 884. <hi>Adrian the</hi> 3<hi>d.</hi> denyes the Emperors Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, neceſſary to the creating Popes; and about the year 900. the Empire is wholly and perfectly tranſlated, from the <hi>French</hi> or Caroline race, to the <hi>Germans,</hi> by Pope <hi>Agapetus's</hi> plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
                     <p>And about the year 1000. as ſome write, <hi>Gregory the fifth,</hi> appoints Electors for chooſing the Emperors, whereby they afterwards became weakned, and the Empire broken into factions and parties; and the Pope thereby to have the better opportunity to work his own ends; and to raiſe his greatneſs out of others ruines; ſtriving now to be uppermoſt, not only in Church, but State too; and to be above even the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors themſelves.</p>
                     <p>For after this time open and down right Tyranny over the Emperors, begins to manifeſt it ſelf. Firſt <hi>Pope John,</hi> takes away all choiſe of Popes from the people, to the Clergy only, upon this plauſible ground, <hi>That the People are to be taught, not followed.</hi> Next <hi>Clement the</hi> 2<hi>d.</hi> about 1047. ſet up by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, againſt other Anti-Popes, by the Authority of a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, cauſed the Romans to renounce by oath, the right they claimed, in chooſing Popes.</p>
                     <p>Then about 1050. <hi>Leo the</hi> 9<hi>th.</hi> inveſted by the Emperor is perſwaded by <hi>Hildebrand</hi> to put off his pontificalibus or papal Robes, in his journey from <hi>Germany</hi> to <hi>Rome;</hi> to wave the Emperor, and have a new election from the Roman Clergy; and then made <hi>Hildebrand</hi> Cardinal, who manag'd all at his pleaſure. After this <hi>Nicholas the</hi> 2<hi>d.</hi> about 1060. takes away the election from the Roman Clergy; bringing it about to a Colledge of Cardinals alſo then inſtituted; that is, of <hi>Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Temporal,</hi> or <hi>Lincy-woollcy Princes</hi> like himſelf the Supreme Emperor, as it were; for the greater grandure and more magnificent authority of his <hi>Almighty Holineſs;</hi> who was now
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:40863:66"/>
almoſt got to the top of Empire, Supremacy, and Omnipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. For it was decreed in Council, the Pope only to be choſe by Cardinals, whoſe <hi>Wounderful Worſhips or Eminencies</hi> might lift him up one ſtep higher, even as it were, into <hi>Heaven, to be God on Earth.</hi> For ſo ſome thought fitting afterwards, to ſtile forſooth his divine Majeſty, &amp;c. And then they order <hi>that no lay Perſon ſhould confer Eccleſiaſlick Inveſtiture.</hi> For what ſhould the Church concern them? But yet they themſelves would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt and Crown <hi>Lay Princes.</hi> For though the State had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do with the Church: yet the Church had to do with the State, in order to the good of the Church, neceſſarily. And therefore the Church muſt now comprehend the State; And as it was above it; ſo now muſt rule it for it's own good; as the leſs worthy, for the more worthy. And therefore the <hi>chief Churchman,</hi> muſt be both Supreme <hi>Biſhop and Emperor, or high Prieſt and King.</hi> That is, the Vicar of Chriſt muſt be like his Maſter, and of the ſame Authority in the World, to whom all power was given, both in Heaven and in Earth; thus the Myſtery of Iniquity wrought with all deceitfulneſs, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Accordingly the next year, or two after, <hi>Alexander the</hi> 2<hi>d,</hi> is elected by the Cardinals only, without the Emperor; who complains of this as againſt his right. <hi>Hildebrand</hi> ſtoutly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains it, That the Emperor had no right in the Election of Popes. <hi>Alexander</hi> inclining to yeeld to the Emperor, is ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly box'd by <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> then impriſoned, and at length poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned, to make way for this mighty man of mettal, this <hi>Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Monarch.</hi>

either of Emperor, or Clergy; but the thing being diſputed, and the Emperor ſtriving to vindicate his right, He refers himſelf to the Emperor and Princes.

                     </p>
                     <p>At laſt (4<hi>ly)</hi> the Emperor through theſe means and practiſes deſerted by all, is fain to ſubmit, and (to get off his excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication and be abſolv'd,) forced to come ſuppliant (together with his Empereſs, and young ſon, the Prince) before <hi>Hilde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brand,</hi> barefooted and bare legged, in the cold of Winter, all ragged and torn, and with a pitious Countenance and in a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable poſture, to knock at his Palace Gate, and with tears beg admiſſion, &amp; there to wait three days faſting, till his <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> (now as well as his <hi>Holineſs)</hi> with his Minion, <hi>Madam Mathilda,</hi> or as they called her <hi>St. Peters Daughter,</hi> (that left her own Husband to live with this <hi>Holy Father,</hi> and other Grandees, and Roman Courtiers) deſpiſingly looking out of his window, i'th' mean while, could be at leaſure.

admitted by her mediation, he impoſes on him moſt intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable conditions, and unworthy of the vileſt Slave, and by Oaths, Curſes, and horrible imprecations, obliges him never to receed from obedience to the Pope.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Theſe things ſo tranſacted, not only the like are practiſed by his Succeſſors, to the Emperors following: (as the ſtory will ſhew:) But not long after alſo, they likewiſe decreed it by their Canons, and Eccleſiaſtick, Pontificial Laws,</hi> viz.

                     <p>So that now the Pope begins to take upon him as <hi>High Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,</hi> or <hi>King,</hi> that is above all Kings and Emperors, as well as <hi>High-Prieſt,</hi> and to <hi>play Rex</hi> indeed.

                     <p>The Pope then is now become both <hi>Univerſal High-Prieſt</hi> and <hi>King;</hi> (For ſo their Canons, &amp; Canoniſts, would now about this time have him to be, <hi>viz. Supreme,</hi> nay, <hi>Only Monarch of the World, and Univerſal over all.</hi> For ſo <hi>Baronius,</hi> a cheif Author, contends at this time, <hi>That none on Earth ought to be called Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch but the Pope.)</hi> We ſhall have him <hi>God</hi> too by and by. And the ſame <hi>Baronius</hi> ſticks not at that; but proclaims him, not only greater then Emperors and all Kings; but alſo calls him, <hi>Lord God.</hi> And the Canon ſaith no leſs, both for his <hi>Kingſhip and Godſhip too.</hi> But we muſt for brevity, paſs by theſe things, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>After theſe uſurpations of <hi>Hildebrands,</hi> the ſucceeding Popes follow his practiſes towards the ſucceeding Emperors; and never leave excommunicating and depoſing them, till ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

by force, or fraud they brought them in a manner under their Girdle, and that at laſt, they durſt no more come into <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> nor medle with the affairs thereof: but by their ſtirring up, or backing of parties, and factions were finally outed of all their Provinces and Eſtates there; and not only ſo, but in the end loſt almoſt all their power, and authority in <hi>Germany</hi> too; as after we ſhall ſee.</p>
                     <p>The Princes and Nations alſo, after grievous Wars, Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels and Troubles, (cauſed partly by his and his Clergy's, and Zealous Religioniſts means,) being by degrees brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and ſubdued, one after another, did by their conſent alſo, at length approve thoſe their Decrees, and Canons; and own him as Head; at leaſt of the Church, to excommunicate, &amp;c. (&amp; conſequently to depoſe from Government of the Chriſtian-Flock, as Infidels and Enemies of the Church.) And ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected their Kingdoms, both People and Clergy, very much in temporals alſo; which they did, either for fear of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, and ſuperſtitious people, who had a carnal and furious zeal for the Pope, as Chriſts Vicar; the Church, as out of which no Salvation; and that Religion, as moſt ſuited to the natural man, and the peoples humours and luſts and very ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of God, Religion, and the way of Salvation, &amp;c. or elſe through their own blind Devotion, and Religious Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition; or at beſt pious Veneration of the Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Church, and chief Paſtor and Prieſt thereof, at their firſt turning Chriſtians; (which was for the moſt part but to an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward chriſtianity neither, &amp;c.) and in thoſe times of groſs dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ignorance of the inward Myſtery thereof, &amp;c. All which things by the ſequel of the ſtory will more plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
                     <p>And now being thus raiſed to an earthly power, they quite and clean forget the ſalvation of Souls, ſanctity of Life, and the Commandements of God, Propagation of Religion, and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty towards men: And to raiſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Arms, to make War againſt

Power, Dominion and Riches, yea and with the Goods and Treaſures of the Church to enrich their kindred, and baſe chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and raiſe their families, &amp;c. I ſay theſe and ſuch like things and practiſes, become their only ſtudy and work, and the great buſineſs of (that is of him, that would be accounted) <hi>the chief Shepherd and Biſhop of Chriſtian Souls,</hi> &amp;c. We will inſtance only in ſome of the moſt notorious particulars, and matters of fact, as they occur in time, by the uſurping and incroaching Popes, following; from this <hi>Hildebrand, founder of the Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> as hath been ſhewn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> about<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the year 1073.</p>
                     <p>Next about the year 1090. his ſucceſſor <hi>Urban the</hi> 2<hi>d.</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicates the Emperor likewiſe and depoſes the Antipope by him choſen; and thereby ſets all chriſtiendom in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtion, for theſe two Popes. Therefore in ſtead of <hi>Urban</hi> called <hi>Turban</hi> (or diſturber) And then likewiſe by his Religioniſts and Clergy, ſtirs up, and inflames all chriſtendom with a zeal, for that bloody <hi>Holy War</hi> for recovery of the <hi>Holy Land</hi> from the <hi>Saracens.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Which War conſiſted of twelve expeditions, (and of many
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:40863:68"/>
hundred thouſands at a time for the ſpace of above 200 years together, to the ruine of ſo many millions of Lives) with the Arms firſt of the <hi>Croſs,</hi> and afterwards of <hi>a Globe</hi> too, upon their <hi>Habits,</hi> ſignifying <hi>that Chriſt crucified</hi> (And to be ſure the Pope as his Vicar) ought to be Lord of the whole World.</p>
                     <p>To allay the quarrels of Chriſtian Princes at home, <hi>this Croſs is</hi> often preached up, with wounderous Zeal. So that the main Religion of the World, (the Rulers and People,) generally in thoſe days, lay moſtly in outward Chriſtianity againſt Infidels<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Turks, and Pagans; and inlarging of <hi>this Viſible Church,</hi> as out of which no Salvation, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>But i'th mean while this exhauſive War of Chriſtendom, every way made for the Papal Intereſt: The Popes having thereby greater opportunities to work their own ends out of poor Chriſtians miſguided Zeal; and by weakning and divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Princes, to ſtrengthen and ſettle themſelves: for during all this time moſt cruel and perpetual wars continued at home, between the Popes, and Emperors, for Imperial, and Papal power, and priviledges; the Pope: ſtill uſurping and domineering every day more and more.</p>
                     <p>About 1100. <hi>Paſchal the</hi> 2<hi>d,</hi> excommunicates the ſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Henry the</hi> 4<hi>th<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                        </hi> againſt him, to perſecute him to death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who by the Biſhops is perſwaded to perjury alſo againſt his own Father<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whom the Pope cauſ'd, after he was dead, to lye likewiſe unburied, five years together. He denyed the right of inveſtiture of Biſhops to the Emperor and other Imperial priviledges. And then excommunicated the ſon, now as devoutly as he had done the Father. And entertained and upheld <hi>Anſelme</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> in rebellion againſt his Soveraign.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Paſchal</hi> alſo firſt of all, leaves off cloſing his letters with the year of the Emperor, and ſubſtitutes the year of his Popedom.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>An.</hi> 1120. <hi>Calixtus the</hi> 2<hi>d.</hi> made <hi>Gregory</hi> (ſet up Antipope
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:40863:69"/>
by the ſaid <hi>Henry the</hi> 5<hi>th.) to ride through</hi> Rome <hi>upon a Camels back, with his face towards the Tail, and the tail in his hand for a bridle.</hi> To ſhew, no doubt, that he held up the <hi>Tail (Caeſar)</hi> and not by the <hi>Head,</hi> (St. Peter) &amp;c. and then thruſt him ſhaven into a Monaſtery.</p>
                     <p>About 1150. the Papal Canons &amp; Decretals are firſt hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; which afterwards in proceſs of time were brought into uſe, and ſet up and prevailed in the World and the Church, in oppoſition to the Civil and Imperial Law; and chiefly to advance the Pontificiall Omnipotency, as themſelves phraſe it. And this Canon Law or Divinity (not the Law of God,) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came in time almoſt the only divinity, and ſtudy of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats, and great Church men, who ſtudied little elſe, then to gain and increaſe Church Power, and Treaſure; to get all into their clutches, and to keep all people in ſlavery, and ſubjection to their Authority and Religion.</p>
                     <p>And for others there began to creep in a Scholaſtick Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Philoſiphy, out of the Fathers, and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> together, not the Scripture: And this Philoſiphic-divinity brought all confuſion of Opinions, and learned Ignorance and Error into the world. And for the more piouſly inclined and devout, a practical Divinity of Monkiſh <hi>Legends,</hi> or pious Tales, and at beſt but devout ſtories of the Sanctimonious lives of Saints, &amp;c. all which ſtill made for the Pope.</p>
                     <p>About 1160. <hi>Alexander the</hi> 3<hi>d.</hi> oppoſſes the Emperor, <hi>Frederick</hi> the firſt and excommunicates him, thundering out curſes, and raiſing War againſt him every where, and by the French Kings favour ſettles himſelf in the Popedom. The Emperor notwithſtanding takes <hi>Rome,</hi> and drives the Pope to <hi>Venice</hi> for protection, and ſends his Son, with an Army after him, whom they beat and took Priſoner neer <hi>Venice.</hi> The good Father therefore to preſerve his Son, is forced to ſubmit, and to proſtrate himſelf before the Pope openly in the great Church at <hi>Venice,</hi> to kiſs his feet. Where ſetting his foot on
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:40863:69"/>
the Emperors neck, he impiouſly and imperiouſly was not aſham'd to ſay, <hi>Thou ſhalt tread upon the Lyon, and the Adder, and the Dragon ſhalt thou trample under foot.</hi> And when the Emperor took the boldneſs to reply and ſay, <hi>I do it not to you, but to</hi> Peter; The proud Beaſt goes on, <hi>To</hi> Peter <hi>and to me too.</hi> And from this time forth, and for evermore forſooth, it muſt be an high favour to kiſs his <hi>Toes,</hi> as much as other Princes hands.

                     <p>This Pope likewiſe upheld <hi>Thomas a Becket,</hi> againſt his King, here in <hi>England;</hi> and made the King ſubmit to the laſh, for <hi>St. Thomas's</hi> death, (for his Holineſs Sainted the Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor) and upon his ſubmiſſion granted to him and his heirs, <hi>The title of the Kings of England.</hi> (As if they never had it ſince the Conqueſt of right before.) Hence it is obſerved, ſayes the Popiſh writers, <hi>That all Kings of</hi> England <hi>muſt acknowledg the Pope for their Landlord.</hi> And in like manner his predeceſſor <hi>Hadrian the</hi> 4<hi>th.</hi> about 1555. gave <hi>Ireland</hi> to the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> for a penny to be paid yearly out of every houſe; (as much as a ſhilling now.)

And this was, and is a conſtant practiſe with them, and a principal matter, whereby they ſtand. For if one deſerts them, another ſtill upholds them, for their own intereſt which is mingled with the Papal, over all the World.</p>

About 1200. <hi>Innocent</hi> the third raiſed <hi>the Otho's</hi> againſt <hi>Philip</hi> the Emperor, reſolving, that he would uncrown him, or be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crown'd by him, becauſe choſe without his liking.

                     <p>And now alſo was brought up that Idol of <hi>Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and adoration of the Hoſt,</hi> to ſubject the people to a more divine Reverance, and external devotion, and deportment, towards their Holy things, and myſteries; (which is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to behold even to this very day) and to make their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Prieſts more Venerable; at leaſt this has been the efect thereof; What matter of Zeal, Fury, and Perſecution this became afterwards, all ſtoryes and ages ring of; as if it had been to deny God indeed, and Chriſt, and all Religion, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny this their <hi>Idol God;</hi> they had and have to this day ſo poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed people with ſuch a fond Imagination.

Alſo that deviſe of Auricular confeſſion was introduced about this time; which aws the people exceedingly likewiſe.</p>
                     <p>Moreover about the ſame time aroſe thoſe deadly ſeuds, between the <hi>Papaline Guelphs</hi> and Imperial <hi>Gibelines,</hi> (or if you will <hi>Elfs and Goblins,</hi> ſo called as is thought from their terrible doings, &amp;c.) which deſtracted all <hi>Italy;</hi> and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uned for many ages after; which factions were ſtirred up by the Pope and his Agents means and practiſes, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>It was about the year 200. likewiſe, that <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> was excommunicated; and then it was ſaid, <hi>In the year of the Reign of Chriſt, not of Philip.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Alſo 1204. the Sea of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> and the Greek Church and Emperor, became ſubject to the Roman, for above 30. years, through their projects, &amp;c. And about 1220. the Eaſt as well as Weſtren Emperor, was crowned at <hi>Rome</hi> by the Pope; no longer now as a Servant, you may now well think, but their Lord, and Superior; by what has been already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed. For in this Popes time, ſome thought fitting to make this Embleme; There are two great lights. <hi>The Sun,</hi> that is, the <hi>Pope;</hi> and the <hi>Moon,</hi> that is the <hi>Emperor.</hi> Nay the high Papaliſts would have none to be truly Monarch, and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, that is abſolute and Independent, on any other as Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme, but the Pope, as before has been intimated.</p>
                     <p>About 1240. the twentieths of Eccleſiaſtick Revenues are obtained for the Pope. It came afterwards to the tenths, nay the fifths, and fourths too in ſome Kingdoms, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>About 1245. <hi>Innocent the fourth</hi> excommunicates the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Frederick,</hi> the fourth time (having been three times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by former Popes) though he had been his greateſt friend; and depoſes him, the King of <hi>France</hi> in vain interceeding; and ſets up <hi>Anti-Ceſaers,</hi> becauſe <hi>his Highneſs</hi> forſooth, would not ſtope low enough <hi>to his Holineſs;</hi> and in the end becauſe he would not bring him enough under, got him poyſon'd.</p>
                     <p>The four orders of the begging <hi>Fryars, viz.</hi> the <hi>Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans,</hi>

                     <p>This Pope demanded alſo the payment of the Twentieths, before granted, and afterwards of the Tenths of all Revenues and Profits of the Church, adding grievous threatnings, if they were not paid; and by his <hi>Legate</hi> in <hi>Poland,</hi> one fifth of all: Afterwards he perſwaded the French King to make War againſt <hi>Henry the</hi> 3<hi>d.</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and to make him either yeeld to all the Pope demanded, or to drive him out of his Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>An.</hi> 1255. The King of <hi>Lithuania</hi> being converted to Chriſtianity is crowned by the Pope, and ſubjects his Kingdom to him. For if they would be Chriſtians, they muſt all acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge Chriſts Vicar, or elſe be Infidels ſtill; for all other Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity now was almoſt fled the Earth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>An.</hi> 1260. The Pope tranſlates the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi> which the King of <hi>Aragon</hi> had made feudatory to the Church, (as before &amp;c.) and which the former Pope alſo would have ſould to <hi>Henry the</hi> 3<hi>d.</hi> of <hi>France</hi> from the right owners; and beſtows it on the French moſt bountifully.</p>
                     <p>And now was the Pope come to the hight of power, riches, and authority, and to have mighty intereſt in the World; and now all the Nations, worſhiped the Beaſt. The Princes gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally began to make appeals to the Roman Court; and the people were devoted to the Romiſh Laws, Cuſtoms, and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.

                     <p>About 1270. <hi>Rodolph</hi> of <hi>Napsburg</hi> (or <hi>Ausburgh)</hi> the firſt of the Auſtrian Houſe, was affraid to go to <hi>Rome</hi> to take his Crown, or to meddle with <hi>Italy;</hi> Becauſe, as he ſaid, <hi>The Fox, ſaw no ſafe return of his Predeceſſors, out of the Lions paws.</hi> And

(Had they done it on the Popes behalf, 'tis like it had paſſ'd for a noble action, as many worſe have done.) The King he contemn'd the excommunication; But the <hi>Sicilians;</hi> they, it ſeems, could not be quiet in their conſciences, or rather in their Kingdom, for ſo bloudy a fact, without doing penance to the Pope, and comimg to ask par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of him; which their Embaſſadors did, by delivering their Supplication in this manner, ſaying three times, <hi>O<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Lamb of God, that takeſt away, the ſins of the World, have mercy upon us.</hi> And this was an expedient Salve, on both ſides, to be quiet.

                     <p>

Whereupon he would not hold it, though the French King much perſwaded him; and decreed, That the Pope might quit his place, and turn Hermet (and honeſt) again; which he did to that end; but was hindred, impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and made away by the impoſtor, that had deceiv'd him, <hi>viz.</hi>

                        <hi>Boniface the</hi> 8<hi>th. who,</hi> the next year 1294. <hi>entered like a Fox; but raigned after like a Lion, and at laſt dyed wretchedly like a Dog.</hi> He exempts the Clergy, by his general Bull, or zeal, from all taxes and payments to temporal Princes. Which was complyed with by the Clergy of <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c. He threw aſhes into an Arch Biſhops Eyes on Aſhwenſday, becauſe he was a Gibelline, and took the Emperors part; excommunicated <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> and gave away his Kingdom to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror; and boaſted, <hi>That all powers were ſubject to him.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted the firſt Jubilee of Triumph therefore; when in that great concourſe of people (and to make it great indeed, every one that did repair to it, was to have a plenary remiſſion of all his ſins; What better invitation, could there be deviſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the fine ſight to be ſeen) The Pope (carried in Proceſſion in a Chair of ſtate; wirh a Sumptuous Canopy born over his Head by Kings, or Nobles, for ſo he is in the year of Jubilee,) ſhewed himſelf openly, before them all, <hi>one day in the habit of a Pope, and the next, in the habit of an Emperor, and every day cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed two Swords to be carried before him, in token, that all power Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical and Civil, did belong unto him,</hi> Yet King <hi>Philip</hi> in contempt of his Bull of excommunication, gave the proud Fool his own, writing back thus, <hi>Let your mighty Foolſhip know, that we are ſubject to none in Temporals.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And from this time forward the year of Jubilee has been uſ'd, as a conſtant Fair, as it were, for the trade of <hi>Indulgence;, Agnus Dei's, and other fine Sanctified knacks,</hi> That ſo the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple invited thereby, to come or ſend from all parts to <hi>Rome</hi> to ſpend their Mony, might not have nothing for it. This was a
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:40863:72"/>
pretty ſtep towards making pardons and indulgences directly ſealable afterwards. And that it might not be ſo long a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they not long after reduced it, from every hundredth to every fiftyeth, and at laſt to every twentyfifth year.</p>
                     <p>In his time about the year 1300. the forementioned facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Guelphs,</hi> and <hi>Gibellines,</hi> the one for the Pope, and the other for the Emperor, grew to their height, and have laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all ages ever ſince, almoſt to ours more or leſs.</p>
                     <p>Not long after <hi>Clement the fifth</hi> removed the Sea from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Avignon</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> where it continued ſeventy years. His inauguration was ennobled with the preſence of ſeveral Kings and Princes; in which Pomp, he loſt a Carbuncle out of his Hat, valued at a great rate. He rooted out the Knights Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plars, as too good for his turn; excommunicated the <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines, Luccans,</hi> and <hi>Venetians. Whoſe Duke, he made come, and beg pardon, chain'd like a Dog, and fed under his Table.</hi> He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated the Emperor of the Eaſt becauſe he would not ſubject himſelf, and the Greeke Church to the Roman, nor ſuffer appeals to <hi>Rome,</hi> as his Father before him had done. And likewiſe durſt, neither fearing God nor man, forgive preſently the Monk that then poyſoned the Emperor of the Weſt in the Hoſt, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>They were now arived to their utmoſt height, and became ſo inſolent and imperious, that they could be indured no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. So that about this time there were ſeveral Meetings and Aſſemblyes of the Empire againſt their intolerable domineer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>An.</hi> 1333. The Pope leaves at his death, a vaſt treaſure of twenty milions of Crowns, which they had amaſſed thus to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, by their extortions, and deviſes. For all things e're this time had been become ſaleable at <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now it was that the Emperors, wholly in a manner, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on the Popes will and pleaſure; who aſſume right and Soveraignty over the Cities Subject to the Empire in <hi>Italy.</hi>
                        <pb n="140" facs="tcp:40863:73"/>
And the Emperors give up, as it were, all their Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, ſo long conteſted for, to the Popes. For <hi>Clement the</hi> 6<hi>th.</hi> after 1340. to diminiſh ſtill more and more the Emperors Right and Authority, created Vicount Vicars to rule the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. Yet the Emperor again in requital, inſtituted other Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cars to governe the Church. This and other things ſo netled him, that he would never be reconciled with the Emperor, except he put himſelf, and all his, into his Holineſs diſpoſal. Which for quietneſs ſake, and to prevent the ſhedding of Chriſtian bloud, the Emperor doth: The Princes of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire exclaim againſt the Popes tyrannical uſurpations. The Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Mentz</hi> is depoſ'd for but ſpeaking on the Fm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors behalf: and the other Electors, partly brib'd, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly awed, agree to ſet up his Son. <hi>Thus the Empire went down, and the Popedom up.</hi> And then cozens the world with his year of Jubilee, reduced to every fifth, and the fine trick of Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, to pleaſe the people, and drive a gainful trade to the Popes. He gave away the <hi>Canaries</hi> alſo to King <hi>Lewis.</hi> And <hi>fifty thouſand perſons had acceſſe to his preſence, in one day, and diſmiſſed again.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>About 1352. The Emperor, to gain Pope <hi>Innocent the</hi> 6<hi>th</hi>'s favour, grants him in a manner all his Authority in <hi>Germany;</hi> and three years after is crowned at <hi>Rome,</hi> by the hand of the Popes Legate; (himſelf reſiding ſtill at <hi>Avignon)</hi> promiſing not to ſtay one day longer at <hi>Rome,</hi> (now the Pope was abſent) then after his Coronation.</p>
                     <p>About 1380. <hi>Clement the</hi> 7<hi>th.</hi> is ſet up anti-Pope, by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of French Cardinals againſt <hi>Urbane the</hi> 6<hi>th.</hi> for being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt returning to <hi>Avignon.</hi> The French and Spaniard ſide with <hi>Clement:</hi> the <hi>Italians, Engliſh, Dutch,</hi> &amp;c. with <hi>Urbane. Rome</hi> is miſerably plundered by <hi>Clement,</hi> and his party. One Popes Bulls roared againſt the others. And all Chriſtendom divided. This ſchiſme laſted neer fifty years.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>An.</hi> 1404. <hi>Innocent the</hi> 7<hi>th.</hi> demands the Moyety of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtick

                     </p>
                     <p>About 1417. Upon the appearance of <hi>Wicklif, Hus Jerom of Prague, Savanarola,</hi> &amp;c. in the world and their followers, it is decreed in Council, <hi>That a Council was above the Pope.</hi> And 1431. The Council of <hi>Baſil,</hi> ſummon the Pope, and put forth a bold Sanction, called therefore <hi>the Pragmatical Sanction,</hi> againſt him, and depoſe him</p>
                     <p>About 1464. <hi>Paul the</hi> 2<hi>d.</hi> ſells all for mony. Reduces the Jubilee to every twentyfifth year to get the more, to maintain Sumtuous and Pompous Habits for himſelf and Cardinals; and Diamonds, Saphirs, Emeralds, Jaſpers, Pearls, and all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Stones, for his Mitre, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>An.</hi> 1492. The Pope gives the Eaſt and Weſt Indies to the Spaniard, and the Portugal, and divides the whole, (new world at leaſt,) betwixt them, as the firſt diſcovers; and not long before gave the title of Catholick King to <hi>Spain,</hi> for the conqueſt of the Infidel <hi>Moors</hi> in <hi>Spain.</hi>

He excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated the King of <hi>France,</hi> who regarded it not; but printed Money with this Inſcription, <hi>I will deſtroy Babylon.</hi> He was in the end depoſed likewiſe by a Council in <hi>France,</hi> like as the Council of <hi>Baſil</hi> had done before, to one of his predeceſſors, as was hinted.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>An.</hi> 1512. <hi>Leo the</hi> 10<hi>th.</hi> an Atheiſt, hug'd and bleſſ'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as it were, to think <hi>What great Riches, that fable of Chriſt had got them.</hi> And yet not enough for his turn, and to ſupply his vile and enormous extravagancies.

                     <p>After 1580. <hi>Sixtus the</hi> 5<hi>th.</hi> excommunicates <hi>Henry the</hi> 3<hi>d.</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> for killing the <hi>Guiſes;</hi> and making uſe of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants on his ſide.

Biſhops ſerved his turn well enough; therefore he muſt paſs for a Tyrant, and be ſtab'd: And yet to abſolve him after he was dead, (when be ſure he could do no more harm, nor ever turn again) for turning Catholick in his life, <hi>Two Embaſſadors muſt be ſent to</hi> Rome, <hi>to be whipt by the Pope in his ſtead, who at the end of every verſe of the eleventh Pſalm, gently ſtrikes with his Rod, the proſtrated Suppliants.</hi> He excommunicated-likewiſe the Duke of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> and added his Dukedom to <hi>St. Peters</hi> Patrimony, as a good parcel of Land.

whereupon War inſued; <hi>Baronias</hi> exhorting the Pope thus, <hi>Ariſe and Eate the Venetians;</hi> as if it had been as eaſie, as to eate his dinner.

                     <p>And while the King was thus good to the Church. The Pope takes that opportunity, to ſee if he could get to be own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as infallible in <hi>France,</hi> and ſupreme Judge and determiner of Controverſies, and differences of Opinions in Religion; finding by woful experience, they ſhould never have that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of a <hi>Vice-God, Omnipotency</hi> in the, World, before they had thisof <hi>Infallibility.</hi> This was towards, and in the year 1666. by <hi>Alexander</hi> the late Pope. But that year has not proved ſo
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:40863:76"/>
kind and lucky to their projects, as they looked for. Nor could they fool <hi>France</hi> into ſuch a premunire.</p>
                     <p>This Pope has had little to do yet, but patch up the <hi>Janſeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Breaches, to avoid further miſchief; (as but now hinted.) To mediate between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> as much as he could; and to invite Princes againſt a leſs worſe Enemy to Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, than himſelf, the Turk; who never did it half ſo much harm; nor ever will. Yet the Noble <hi>Venetians</hi> deſerve Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour, and the <hi>Pope deſtruction.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yet ſo it is that the Kings, Princes, Clergy, and People of the Earth, have ſo drunk of, and been intoxicated with the Cup of <hi>Romes</hi> Fornications, that notwithſtanding all the evill they have ſuffered by her Domineering and Tyrannizing over them, their Kingdoms, Subjects and People, both Soul and Body; as by the foregoing ſtory may in part appear; yet they love to commit folly and abomination with her ſtill; and her fine and goodly Religion, ſo carnal, ſo pleaſing and ſutable to fleſh and bloud. But in the end, ſure God will put it into their hearts (when he ſhall once have opened their Eyes, to ſee what miſeries and miſchiefs, ſhe has brought upon all Kingdoms and Nations, and the whole World too, at leaſt occaſionally, or even but to ſee their own intereſts and concerns) <hi>to hate the Whore and burn her with fire.</hi>

                        <hi>The pretended grouuds and foundations of their Popedom, Spiritual, have been already hinted before. Thoſe for their Temporal are much of the ſame nature,</hi> viz.

For that the Church is above the State; The Head of the Church above the Head of the State. The State for the Church, not the Church for the State; and therefore dominion to be founded in Grace, &amp;c. And ſo no Enemies of the Church, Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, or Hereticks to be capable thereof; but to be deſtroyed, and rooted out, &amp;c. <hi>(which are, all they ſhall judge ſo.)

                     <p>But in one word, an outward Carnal Religion in the Letter without the Spirit; The form of Godlineſs without the Power.

                     <p>

                     <p>About 1647. The Pope ſeized on the Dukedom of <hi>Caſtro,</hi> from the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> upon the account of feudatory Quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, due to the Popes, whence aroſe War. But the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie was compoſed by the authority of the King of <hi>France,</hi> in their late treaty, 1664. when agreed, that <hi>Caſtro</hi> ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to <hi>Parma,</hi> and the Duke to pay the mony due, &amp;c.

                     <p>And thus we have in general repreſented the foundations and Revolutions of the Papal Hierarchy, or Kingdom of the Pope; both Temporal and Spiritual; its riſe, growth, increaſe height and decreaſe; not being able well to comprehend ſo long and myſterious an Hiſtory, and ſo confuſed with all others in leſs room, and willing only to touch upon chief particulars of their uſurpations, incroachings, and domineerings, down to our times, that ſo you might have a Map or Table, and plain veiw, as it were at once, of this Eccleſiaſtical and Prieſtly King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. All which 'twas neceſſary to fetch ſo high, the better to underſtand the coherence of the ſtory and preſent State thereof, with the Affairs and Revolutions (both of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Religions) of all Chriſtendom; which it has ſo wretchedly involved it ſelf with.</p>
                     <p>The ſum of all, in ſhort is this.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Popedom was, a digging, working, and preparing,</hi> as it
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:40863:78"/>
were, <hi>underground, about</hi> 400. <hi>years moſt eminently from Victor, about the year</hi> 192. <hi>and others,</hi> (eſpecially afterwards from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great about the year 300.) <hi>to Boniface the</hi> 3<hi>d. About the year</hi> 600. <hi>As Covetous, Proud, Corrupt, Opinio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, and in one word Apoſtate, Luciferian Biſhops, Paſtors, and Prieſts;</hi> that had fell from their firſt ſtanding, and foundation of the Apoſtles, that is, the primitive purity and ſimplicity of the Goſpel, to deviſed Fables, Ceremonies, Inventions, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, and Prudentials, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The Popedom Spiritual, or Univerſal Hierarchy, was founded by <hi>Boniface,</hi> as Univerſal Biſhop, and high Prieſt. And from him to <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> for about <hi>400.</hi> years more. <hi>Hence the Titles of Divine Celeſtial Majeſty.</hi> The Popedom Temporal, was founded by <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> as Univerſal Monarch. <hi>Hence from both</hi> Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent the <hi>8</hi>th. <hi>is ſtilled,</hi> one above all Principalities and Powers, and every name that is named in this or the other World.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And the</hi> Height and flouriſhing of both, under <hi>Alexander the 3d.</hi> and <hi>Boniface the 8th.</hi> who boaſted that all powers were become ſubject to him, &amp;c. to the dawning of the Reformation, by <hi>Wicklif,</hi> &amp;c. another four hundred years, the Brightnes whereof has been ever ſince, by degrees, a conſuming it. <hi>And if we may</hi> gueſs, by the Stars, <hi>the laſt great</hi> Conjunction of the two Superior Planets in the fiery Trigon in <hi>1663. (which never happened before ſince</hi> Charls <hi>the Great's time 800. years agoe) they bode no good predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for the Popedom; but look as if they</hi> would burn up <hi>(Alſted ſayes)</hi> all the droſs and dregs of <hi>Rome,</hi> more then the fire of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> was ever like to do, as they accounted of the Proteſtants. <hi>But we muſt not think that</hi> Rome <hi>is only in</hi> Rome, <hi>though there ſhe ſits as a Queen, ſeing no ſorrow.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>During the firſt 400. years they contended for preeminence, priviledges, dominion, and riches to maintain it; and began to Lord it over, and incroach upon other Churches, as the beſt. the moſt orthodox, and moſt Apoſtolick; as the chiefeſt, and moſt flouriſhing and Imperial Church.</p>

For Pope <hi>Victor</hi> about the year 192. excommunicated the Eaſtern Biſhops, for not keeping Eaſter the ſame day with him; concerning which point the Weſt (or Roman) Church after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards prevailed, under <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, by the Council of <hi>Nice;</hi> the Eaſtern ſtanding for the tradition of <hi>St. John,</hi> and <hi>Philip;</hi> the Weſtern for that of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Afterwards they induced <hi>Conſtantine</hi> upon his Infant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, as the firſt Chriſtian Emperor, to be good to the Church which had ſo ſuffered under the Heathen Emperors; and to make it great, glorious, and flouriſhing in the world; and peace ſetled in the Church; together with Dignities, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, and Preferments, (in a politick and prudential way namely to avoid Hereſies, Schiſmes, and Factions of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp;c.) they began now to Lord it over one another, and over Gods Heritage, which they had not opportunity to do before, under perſecution; nor ſufficiently to ſhew the rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenneſs of their Religion at the heart.</p>
                     <p>They brought <hi>Conſtantine</hi> to decree, <hi>Tithes to be paid of all things to all Churches;</hi> At which time was heard this voice in the air, <hi>now is poyſon poured into the Church;</hi> which refers to the pride of the Biſhops and Clergy, which theſe riches occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned afterwards.

                     </p>
                     <p>During the next 400. years, they contended with the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern Biſhops and Patriarchs of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> for Univerſal Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, deviſing divers ſad ſtories and complaints; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croached more and more upon the Emperors, and civil matters of State; and became as well Troublers of the Empire, as of the Church.</p>
                     <p>For the other four hundred, they contended with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors themſelves, for Univerſal Monarchy; (or Supremacy in Church and State;) iuterwove Temporal Juriſdiction with

Spiritual, and at laſt withdrew themſelves from all ſubjection to the Emperors, and brought them indeed under their feet; uſurping and inlarging power and dominion to themſelves, out of others ruines, &amp;c. as by the forgoing ſtory may partly appear.</p>
                     <p>But this laſt (neer) 300. years, they have <hi>ſwelled only with Titles, and big words,</hi> and roared a little with their <hi>curſed Bulls with ſhort Horns.

Such a ſweet proud Tyranny it is.</p>
                     <p>And now this long lived Popedom, is come to its old age, and drawing towards its end, <hi>and from</hi> 666, <hi>plainly lyes a dying;</hi> againſt which year it ſtrove, as it were, for life again, once more, in <hi>England, Ireland, Holand, France, Poland, Suitzerland, Piemont,</hi> &amp;c. with ſtruglings in the world afreſh, are to be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned, but as <hi>lightenings before death;</hi> Unto which, if it fill up the 100. current, or more, 'twill but be anſwerable to ſuch tough, <hi>and laſting heart of Oak,</hi> too great to be rooted up in one generation.</p>

                  <p>We have ſeen a lamentable twenty years Civil Wars in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> &amp;c. The whole Subverſion both of Church and State.

                     <head>The Pretenſions and Intereſt of Europe.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The pretenſions of Europe</hi> are either of one part, to another, as of <hi>England</hi> to <hi>France; Spain</hi> to <hi>Portugal,</hi> &amp;c. of which 'twill be needleſs to ſpeak a word: or elſe to other parts of the World, as to <hi>Aſia, Africa,</hi> or <hi>America.</hi> Of which a word or two. Theſe pretences are founded on wrong and falſe titles; as Right of diſcovery, or of Chriſtianity and Religion; and the Popes donation and diſpoſal of the whole Infidel world accordingly thereupon.</p>
                     <p>For towards the year 1500. Pope <hi>Alexander the 6th.</hi> as if he was Maſter of the whole Earth, diſtributed, by his Bull, all the new World between <hi>Ferdinand the 5th.</hi> King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> King of <hi>Portugal.</hi> Here was a wonderful donation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, of the World from Eaſt to Weſt, parted between two Princes.</p>
                     <p>And to make them agree, it was accorded, that the Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſs ſhould equally ſhare from the fortunate Iſlands, or <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> by one ſtreight line from <hi>North</hi> to <hi>South,</hi> for the firſt Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian, an hundred and eighty degrees (that is, one half of the World) Eaſtward; and the Spaniard, as many Weſtward; And that both one and the other, ſhould have right to take poſſeſſion of all the Earth they could ſeize on; and all upon this title forſooth, That they ſhould convert the Infidels, and Barbarous Nations to the Chriſtian Faith; which they did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed more like Infidels and Barbarians then Chriſtians. So mankind preys one upon another, like ravenous Beaſts and Birds of prey; Neither can the Proteſtans perhaps much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the Papiſts upon this account; and both will alwayes agree in this point, <hi>that glory and gain, are not to be neglected, what ever becoms of Chriſtianity or humanity it ſelf.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But when the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> through ignorance and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:40863:85"/>
judged that they had wrong done them, (as yet igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant that the World was round, or might be ſail'd round,) by great importunity, they extorted, that the firſt Meridian, ſhould be removed from the <hi>Canary Iſlands,</hi> to the <hi>Azores,</hi> three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred miles more Weſtward. Hence the firſt Meridian ever ſince, has place not in the <hi>Canaries,</hi> but the <hi>Azores</hi> Iſlands. the cauſe of which mutation, is not the declination of the Margent, and variation of the Needle, or Compaſs: but this diviſion between the <hi>Portugueſs</hi> and <hi>Spaniard.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now by this change, it happened that the Portugals after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards obtained <hi>Braſil</hi> in the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> which fell within the Meridian of the <hi>Azores:</hi> but the Spaniards reaped a far greater advantage; becauſe they from that time chalenge right to the greateſt part of the <hi>Eaſt Indies, viz.</hi> the <hi>Philippy Iſlands,</hi> (which they have to this day, to the <hi>Molucco's,</hi> and others, &amp;c. then out of diſpute the <hi>Portugals.</hi> And this made the <hi>Spaniard</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes retire and adhere to the <hi>Azores</hi> for the firſt Meridian.</p>

                        <hi>As for the Intereſts of Europe,</hi> in theſe ſad diſ-unions, revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and confuſions of Chriſtendom; <hi>The Intereſts</hi> of the whole and of every part ſeems mainly to be, to agree in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and known Articles of Faith; and not devour one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as Infidels and Pagans, for Opinions or Ceremonies; and exclude not only one another their Church; but their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and the World too, for Hereticks; or if not agreement; at leaſt <hi>Freedom, and liberty of Religion;</hi> which is no <hi>unpracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable Romance</hi> we ſee alſo for Chriſtian Princes to unite, not ſo much againſt the Turk, as with one another; and not deſtroy and ruine one anothers Kingdoms, and ſo many Subjects lives, in unnatural unchriſtian Wars, and quarrels; and laſtly each Nation to accord and conſpire together into mutual correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence and free intercourſe, in all their moſt excellent and uſeful things, of Nature, Art and Religion.</p>

<pb n="166" facs="tcp:40863:86"/>
Hiſtory of Europe; not from the uncertain conjectures of Aſtrologians and Politicians, but Revelations truly accounted Divine.</p>
                  <p>If it more immediately concern all to know the preſent State of Chriſtendom, and of this laſt age above all before, that are paſt and gone, and almoſt forgotten; yet that is principally in order to what is to come: And ſo much more it concerns us to conſider what ſhall be hereafter, then the things that have been, and are.</p>
                  <p>And indeed this all mens minds generally are moſt inquiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive after, yet few will have faith to believe. And hence the knowledge of things to come, is one part of Hiſtory, as well as of thoſe that are paſt. Wherefore I ſhall think it no unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable ſervice to my Country men, and not unbefitting this place, to repreſent to view a ſummary draught alſo of thoſe wonderful Viſions and Revelations of <hi>Dabricius,</hi> by the Godly and Learned eſteemed Divine; at leaſt that few yet dare ſay are meer phanatick deluſions, or diabolical; that ſo this Hiſtorical Table or Repreſentation of things laſt paſt, and next to come; may be for more profit and advantage, and of greater uſe, to the Engliſh Reader.</p>
                  <p>'Tis certain all the world expects ſome great Cataſtrophe and Revolutions at hand, and great have lately paſt in all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, preparatory thereunto. All Aſtrologers gaze for it; All Politicians preſage it, all Theologers divine it; And generally All People, Jews, Turks, Chriſtians, Papiſts and Proteſtants, ſeem to beſpeak as much. As if ſome dark intelligence were hovering up and down, to abode and whiſper ſome ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter preſently to betide the world. The Jews ſtand gazing for the Kingdom of their Meſſias; the Turks, of their Mahomet; The Chriſtians of their Chriſt, and the Papiſts of their Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt.</p>
                  <p>The Planetary Conjunction, and new Stars, the dreadful Comets, and terrifying Prodigies. The remarkable predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:40863:86"/>
and prophetick Spirits, yea the very falſe prophets too, in ſeveral Countries; The wonderfull providences, and ſtrange revolutions and alterations of this laſt Age, ſpecially thoſe of late; as the great Eclipſes not many years agoe. The new Star in 1572. in 1604. and lately in 1660. The fiery Trigon begun 1603. and ended with that great Conjunction of the two ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Planets, <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter,</hi> in that fiery Trigon, in 1663. never before this eight hundred years <hi>(viz.</hi> at the beginning of the German Empire by <hi>Charls</hi> the Great) and hoped to be the laſt being the ſeventh only of the world; having never hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened but ſix times before, ſince the Creation. And this being alſo the third Conjunction of thoſe ſuperior Planets (which is every twenty years) in the ſeventh fiery Trigon, and falling in the year 1663. <hi>(Rome, Rome!</hi> remember ſixty three and three, was ſaid of that year by the Aſtrologers.) and the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of all the ſeven Planets (in the fiery ſigne of Sagittary alſo) preceeding it (which whether ever happened before ſince the beginning of the world, is not known) makes ſome, not only take a Sign, but a beginning of ſome great Mutation in Religion and Government. In Religion, namely the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Jews, Turks and all the Nations of the Gentiles. In State, the ſubverſion of all Tyrannicall Rule and Domination, and all manner of oppreſſion and violence in the Earth. The too late Prodigious Comets ſucceeding about a year after, (as well as thoſe in 1652. and 1618.) <hi>Saturn being in the Houſe of Infirmity; for ſix month before;</hi> concerning which there is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, a ſtrange Prophecy found by <hi>Capiſtranus</hi> above two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years agoe, and printed above an hundred agoe at <hi>Venice,</hi> and afterwards (upon the Comet in 1618. appearing,) at <hi>Pargue</hi> in <hi>Germany</hi> in 1620. and ſaid by the ſaid <hi>Capiſtran</hi> to be one of the <hi>Sybill's,</hi> twenty years before Chriſt; concerning the ruine of the Pope and Emperor, and return of the Apoſtolick times. There is alſo ſome thing particular mentioned in <hi>Capiſtrans</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication concerning <hi>France,</hi> (and others) <hi>Aix la Chapelle,</hi>
                     <pb n="168" facs="tcp:40863:87"/>
which is forgot. The Prophecy, ſaid to be of the <hi>Sybills;</hi> was only in figures of a Woman with a Triple Crown, embraced by a Crowned King or Emperor. With a Wheel with twelve ſpokes denoting the Cardinals, like the twelve Apoſtles. with the Arms of <hi>France, Low-Countries<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> &amp;c. with other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars forgotten. From one Angel appeared a blazing Star, dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Woman and Emperor, &amp;c. <hi>Capiſtran</hi> by a prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Spirit wrote an explication, of every particular, in ſhort Motto's writ underneath each; which he buried in a wall, (not daring to make it known in thoſe times. Being an enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened Monk) and was found an hundered years after, and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as was ſaid at <hi>Venice.</hi> The Motto under the Comet is only remembered, <hi>viz. Saturn in the houſe of Infirmity,</hi> which ſome Aſtronomers ſay, could be meant of no former Comet, but this laſt only, having examined it by their Rules. Since this we have ſeen the ſudden irruption of the <hi>French</hi> into <hi>Flanders,</hi> &amp;c. and the peace ſoon made again at <hi>Aix la Chapel,</hi> and yet indeed as good as no peace, but rather a truce. It were well this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy were better looked into to ſee whether any thing ſolid to be obſerved therein; or any thing that may anſwer and concern the preſent affairs, or the late Comet yea, or no.</p>
                  <p>In fine the moſt lamentable Wars, Plagues, Fires, and ſad calamities and heavy and grievous judgments of Gods wrath abroad in the Earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> eſpecially the aſtoniſhing <hi>Blazing Fire of London, ſoon after in</hi> 1666.

deliverance from ſuch heavy burdens; all theſe things, I ſay, ſeem to forſpeak or intimate ſome dreadful matter drawing neer.

And ſo there will be no end of ſuch imaginations, &amp;c. And therefore we paſs by all ſuch witty conceits as to unworthy of ſo great a Myſtery, more ſolid is that of a Prophet amongſt our ſelves reckoning 1666 from the death of Chriſt (whereby he got the Victory over all his Enemies,) rather then from his Birth, though the foundation was laid there.

But to the buſineſs, namely <hi>Debricius's Revelations.</hi> But we muſt indeavour briefly firſt, to prevent all occaſion of prejudice and raſh and indiſcreet judgment and ſenſures of the impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent unbeleiving and erring World. By telling how they have been approved of as truly from God, by moſt Godly and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Divines here in <hi>England,</hi> as well as elſewhere, and all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wayes and means to have been uſed to diſcover any cheat or impoſture; which none have been able to do for this thirty years together.</p>
                  <p>To clear the Readers way to the things themſelves, we ſhall only give a brief account of the laſt moſt ſevere and rigorous examination of <hi>Drabricius,</hi> in brief thus.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Drabricius</hi> ſeemed to promiſe from God victories, and the Kingdom to <hi>Ragotzi</hi> (and other things to others, &amp;c.) who yet was killed by the Turks in 1660. which moſt of all made his Propheſies ſuſpected. Thoſe of his fraternity therefore ſeing all things go worſe in <hi>Hungary;</hi> and leaſt they ſhould all ſuffer for the fault of one, they take councel together to remove from themſelves all ſuſpition of compliance or conſpiracy with him.</p>
                  <p>The principal therefore among them was <hi>Felinus</hi> a Paſtor of the Exciles at <hi>Puchow</hi> who wrote a book in latine called the <hi>Ignis Fatuus,</hi> or <hi>falſe fire</hi> of <hi>Nicholas Drabricius.</hi> Indeavouring to demonſtrate, all the Revelations of <hi>Drabricious</hi> either to be meer figments of his own brain, or meer ſatanical deluſions; and dedicated to the <hi>Belgick</hi> Churches in <hi>Holand,</hi> which yet thoſe from whom he required it to be printed, thought not adviſable yet to do it; but rather thought him too raſh and haſty. This Paſtor dying according to Gods threatening by Revelations to <hi>Drabricius. Veterinus,</hi> another of the Seniors of the ſame Church, not at all terrified at this event, a chief inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gator of <hi>Felinus,</hi> undertakes the cauſe, which the aforeſaid <hi>Paſtor</hi> loſt his life in, and by divers writings, letters, and epiſtles, to divers perſons, bitterly renews the accuſations, and
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:40863:90"/>
mightily urged the Edition of the <hi>falſe fire,</hi> and aſſumed a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, the more to help him therein.</p>
                  <p>So that new Diſſentions, Diviſions, Schiſmes, Hatreds, and Scandals aroſe, and even thoſe who were moſt perſwaded of theſe Revelations began to heſitate and doubt. Therefore tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing counſel together they decreed to bring this cauſe before God, in ſeting a part dayes of prayer, and faſting, (the means to caſt out Devils) and laſtly to give <hi>a Solemn Oath,</hi> the onely ordained means of God, to put an end to all ſtriffe. The So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Form of Prayer uſed among all, both in <hi>Holand</hi> and elſe where we ſhall not inſert here.</p>
                  <p>At this time one of the Juniors of the fraternity returned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Hungary</hi> ſent by <hi>Comenius</hi> and others with theſe inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. (1.) To inform the Brethren (where ever in any place congregated) of the modren ſtate of the controverſie, and what we thought needfull to be done; and to require a fraternal co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operation to take away ſcandals. (2.) That the ſtate of the controverſie lay in this, Whether Father <hi>Nicholas Drabricius</hi> did really and in truth, undergoe any divine Revelations, or whether obſtinately and impiouſly fained them. Some Godly hope the firſt; <hi>Paul Veterinus</hi> affirms the laſt. They were to ſee therefore on what foundation, the one and the other built. And that it was decreed to commit the Judgment to God the Avenger. And to bring him to an examination, ſuch as had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet been, by a moſt dreadful Oath, which is the Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, for the deſiding of controverſies; and an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary one alſo, in ſuch an extraordinary caſe. And the very form thereof out of the Divine Scriptures, to be offered to <hi>Drabricius;</hi> which if he ſubmit to, and take, that it is our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to leave the Judgment and Vengeance to God. And <hi>Vete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinus</hi> if he will not reſt in that, to take heed leaſt he provoke the juſt Vengeance of God, in ſeeking to take the Sword of Vengance out of his hands.</p>
                  <p>And laſtly, whether <hi>Drabricius</hi> would confeſs, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,

                        <p n="1">(1.) Firſt I the Paſtor of the People of <hi>Puchow,</hi> preſently
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:40863:93"/>
the ſame day that I received yours, calling together the Elders of my Church, and my fellow Labourer, unſealed in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence your letters that concern'd us jointly; and perceiving the contents, I wrote the next day early to the Brethren of <hi>Ledna,</hi> and informed them that our fellow Brother ſent to us was come, and had brought ſingular commands to us all, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated them to come unto us, which they did the ſame 9<hi>th of July</hi> at evening. Where I delivered into <hi>Drabricious's</hi> hands thoſe that concerned him, and invited him to lodge with me all night, and the reſt ſhould underſtand what the buſineſs was to morrow.</p>
                        <p n="2">(2.) The next day, after publick prayers in the Holy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, we entered into mine, the Paſtor's, Houſe. Where after a general ſalutation of <hi>Drabricius,</hi> (which could not be done conveniently in the Temple,) I ſaid, that we had an hard buſineſs before us, and therefore need again begin with Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of mercy from God, to obtain the Grace of the Holy Spirit. When <hi>Drabricius</hi> ſaid, <hi>Do you pray here, I will go aſide into my Chamber, and perform my prayers alſo. And ſo went out.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">(3.) We therefore, firſt, ſinging that Pſalm, <hi>Come Holy Ghoſt,</hi> &amp;c. we all proſtrated our ſelves on our knees, and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red forth our Groans to the Lord, in a prayer appointed for this very purpoſe.</p>
                        <p n="4">(4.) After prayer, we ſate together in Aſſembly, and the Paſtor of the place giving thanks that they had appeared at his deſire, informed them what was to be done. Then the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Epiſtle to all was read. Next the Oath preſcribed for <hi>Drabricius (at the horrour of which almoſt all of us ſtood aſtoniſhed and terrified.)</hi> And <hi>Fr. Samuel</hi> gave his Inſtructions to be read.</p>
                        <p n="5">(5.) After <hi>ſome deliberation had</hi> upon theſe things, <hi>Drabricius</hi>
                           <pb n="181" facs="tcp:40863:93"/>
was called, and being asked by the Paſtor of the place, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he would hear the Letters from <hi>the Reverend Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,</hi> dated to this Aſſembly, and underſtand the contents? He aſſented, adding, <hi>I was not ignorant for ſome weeks what was about to be done concerning me; For the Lord ſhew'd it to me. If I had known before, I would have took you along with me, to ſee.</hi> I reply'd, let that alone in its own place. Let us come to the buſineſs.</p>
                        <p n="6">(6.) Firſt therefore was read unto him the common Epiſtle; Then the form of the Oath (but before this was read I did ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh and beſeech him, that he would weigh all things ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly. For therein were terrible things, and the matter here in agitation concerned the Salvation of his Soul.) And laſtly the inſtructions given to <hi>Sam. Jun. To all which when he thereupon anſwered nothing,</hi> He was again asked, Whether he was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be dealt with according to theſe preſcripts here? <hi>He anſwered directly. Yes, I will.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="7">(7.) Whereupon the third Queſtion was propoſed. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther therefore he did account, and would have accounted all his Revelations for truly Divine? And whether he did yet aſſert all thoſe things to be ſpoken to him and written of him, by the Command of the Omnipotent God <hi>Jehova,</hi> who is not only Merciful, but is Juſt alſo, without any additions? He anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>I do aſſert ſo. Yea and I take it upon my Soul, that nothing has been added by me, and that nothing has been ſpoken by me, for any lucre ſake, or in favour, or hatred of any perſon.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="8">(8.) <hi>Proceeding further, we asked, Whether he would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it by ſuch an Oath as was preſcribed? And again we exhorted him, not to act precipitantly, but to deliberate, yea and to take time for deliberation; that we would indulge him therein. He anſwered,</hi> There's no need of deliberation. And
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:40863:94"/>
riſing up, and lifting up both his hands to Heaven, He thus ſpeak; I take upon my ſoul, whatever there is contained in theſe Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons written by me, has not at all been deviſed by me, nor any thing of mine own added; but only thoſe very things which the Lord the Doinator, has commanded to be written. And I firmly believe the Holy Bleſſed Trinity will own all theſe for his, as for thoſe which are commanded to be written by the Eternal Wiſdom it ſelf.</p>
                        <p n="9">
                           <hi>(9.) Entring forth therefore unto the Table, and taking the form of the Oath into his hand,</hi> he pronounced in order, clearly, diſtinctly all things (omitting nothing, rather here and there ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adding ſome things for more vehement aſſeveration ſakes) with ſo great zeal, that all we preſent ſeeing and hearing theſe things, ſtood aſtoniſhed. Some of us alſo trembled and wept. But in the very midſt of the Oath he looked forth out of the Window <hi>(which was open)</hi> towards Heaven, crying out, Do you not ſee, friends, do you not ſee? <hi>But we asked not what he ſaw<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (which in conference with Fr.</hi> Sam.

                           <hi>(10.) Having ended the Oath, he ſat down, and laying his face upon the Table, he put that Paper (out of which he had recited the Oath,)</hi> after thrice kiſſing it, <hi>under his face.

                  <p>There is added alſo the Judgement of two Godly Engliſh Divines, with divers forcible Arguments for the divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of theſe Revelations, too long for this preface.</p>

That which is not fulfilled acording to the Letter in our ſence, is fulfilled according to the Spirit, in Gods ſenſe and meaning, as of the eternal Kingdom fothwith of the Meſſiah, the Son of <hi>David.</hi> (3.) What is not done, the condition being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, was yet to be done, the condition not altered.

That where there is not ſuch a poſſibility, it may be then thought that <hi>the Prophet</hi> has ventured to add ſomething of his own, according to his own ſenſe and apprehenſions. For Prophets are ſubject to Error, Paſſions, Affections, &amp;c. which the ſpirit of Prophecy does not always take away.

                  <p>Beſides <hi>Comenius,</hi> ſome years before, namely in 1658. find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all things go contrary rather to his Prophecyes, wrote ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely to him, and with great rebukes, &amp;c. who thus replyed, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I received yours full of Zeal, full of Lamentations, full of Interrogations, to which you require me, a worm, contemn'd of men, condemned, half put to death, to anſwer. Which after I had read over and weighed, I had reſolved to anſwer with ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, &amp; to commend the matter to God the ſearcher of hearts, yet crying aloud,</hi> Come expoſtulate with me! But the Lord ſuffer'd me not to hold my peace, &amp;c. But as for me, I muſt ſay with <hi>Jeremy,</hi> Wo unto me, my Mother, that thou boreſt me, whom all do curſe! I beſprinkle theſe with tears, with <hi>Jeremy,</hi> ſaying, In truth the Lord hath commanded me, to write theſe things. Yet behold the word of the Lord is made unto me for a reproach, &amp;c. <hi>Is it not the voice of God which ſaith, The Lord doth not any thing, unleſs he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealeth his ſecret to his Servants. And by</hi> Joel, <hi>he promiſes that it ſhould come to paſs in the laſt times,</hi> That their young men ſhould ſee Viſions, and their old men dream dreams. <hi>And why as yet, ye illuminated men, I beſeech you, do you expect the laſt times? But becauſe the Lord hath ſaid unto me alſo</hi> (Jan. <hi>14. 1651.) a man of polluted lips,</hi> That I ſhould be his laſt Trumphet, Behold I, behold with full confidence and aſſurance, in the ſight of God, Angels and men, do boldly ſpeak, that they are the words of God, which I have wrote. And except it were ſo, I know, that though I deceived men, yet I could not deceive God, nor my own conſcience; but ſhould undoubtedly procure confuſion and deſtruction to my ſelf. But behold, as I live, or dye, that I have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten what I have heard from the Mouth of God, let men take it as they pleaſe. <hi>To God be praiſe, that now the world ſhall no longer be ignorant of thoſe things, which the Lord would have denounced and declared by me unto it.</hi> Let who ſo will diſpute
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:40863:96"/>
againſt thoſe things, but not againſt me. For the Lord hath ſaid unto me, his worm, Thou art not of thus much, to defend thy ſelf, much leſs me, &amp; my words; I will defend my ſelf when I ſhall fulfil my words. The Sons of men underſtand not the hight of my Councels, as neither alſo th Angels, until they are fulfilled. I will finiſh what I have begun. Let who ſo will, be ſcandalized as he will. Let this be for thy comfort, that what thou haſt wrote, thou haſt heard of me, not from any one of men that are like unto thy ſelf. Be confident therefore with me my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Friend, that it will come to paſs, that accuſers will grow mute when the hour of God comes. <hi>For the Word of the Lord will be an heavy burden to deriders. But for us, let us more fear God, who has power to kill Body and Soul; then mortal men who can do nothing, but what God permits them. That of yours,</hi> God forgive us the haſty Edition of the Book, <hi>I thus change.</hi> Praiſe be unto God, who has vouchſafed us to free our Conſciences, in not hiding from the Sons of Men thoſe things, which the Mouth of God hath ſpoken.</p>
                  <p>Hereunto <hi>Comenius</hi> again, (from the increaſed taunts of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers) and filled with greater bitterneſs, retorted, If you, Friend, are ſo certain of Gods ſpeaking to you, that you are willing to ſeal it with your death, your certainty will ſerve for your ſelf, but not thoſe, whom the contrariety of events renders uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. And we ſee continual examples of ſuch as have embraced errors for truth, have been willing to lay down their lives for them, as for the very moſt truth, being perſwaded nothing elſe in the ſight of God, then that they had believed, taught and wrought things moſt true. And yet therefore did not Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror ceaſe to be Error. You give firm belief to thoſe words ſpoke to you, <hi>Thou art that my laſt Trumpet.</hi> I but this perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually remains a queſtion, whoſe voice that may be, &amp;c. Do you bid us put our hope in God? There is no where, where I can fix the Anchor of my Hope, but in him who knows the ſimplicity of my heart, that I have feigned nothing here; nor have added any thing to, nor taken from, nor changed thoſe
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:40863:96"/>
things, which were brought in the name of God. In the thing it ſelf if there be found error, the goodneſs of God will over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look the fault of humane frailty, committed by no manner of fraud, or deſign. And this ſhould be taken as a ſudden confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the ſight and preſence of God, inſtead of a chaſtiſment, more cautiouſly to lead our life. But if yet at length it ſhall appear to have been the work of God, even this my fluctuation muſt neceſſarily ſerve for the greater glory of God, and the comfort or inſtruction of the Godly; Although I, as <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſhould ſuffer for it in this life. God only forbid that others, or even all our Church, ſhould neceſſarily ſuffer ignominy and perſecution for us. Whereas you exhort to praiſe God, that notice of theſe things are given to the Sons of men, I know it is written, that alſo the fury of men muſt at length praiſe God, and to that end, the wiſedom of God is illuſtrated by the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhneſs of men. Yet the queſtion remains, what we are to do in the mean while. Some Friends here perſwade Silence. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to give glory to God, and forſake <hi>Drabricius,</hi> from whom alone almoſt theſe ſcandals do come. Anſwer what you think, and that preſently. I will expect your anſwer with unceſſant ſighs and breathings to God. And indeed moſt open heartedly, <hi>as at the Tribunal of God, whither I cite you to appear.</hi> Deal I ſay candidly with me, but even now at length, <hi>I adjure you by that tremendous Name, &amp; the ſalvation of your Soul, by not concealing that ſome of thoſe things which are ſo manifeſtly falſe, have been additaments of your own conjecture.</hi> This, if you ſhall do, the ſcandals in great part will ceaſe. Becauſe we are admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed that humane deviſings are fallacious. I know no more efficacious remedy; and it ſhall be, that God will judge you according to the Integrity of your heart, and being propitious to us all, bruiſe Satan under our feet, although in our own ſhame and confuſion. May only the glory of Gods Truth ſtand unſhaken, and none of the Godly be made ſad by us or for us, much leſs the whole Church. <hi>I again, and again conjure you by</hi>
                     <pb n="188" facs="tcp:40863:97"/>
                     <hi>God and your own Soul, deal ſincerely with me, in this matter, now at length.</hi> The Holy good Spirit rule you. Farewel.</p>
                  <p>To ſo many obteſtations of his, <hi>Drabricius</hi> returned his conteſtations, more ſharply upbraiding the puſillanimity of his Faith. And wrote down adviſe and counſel, what he ſhould do, <hi>not in his own words, but of the very Oracle it ſelf.</hi> (Revelat. 460. afterwards.) And at length alſo <hi>a Preface,</hi> wherein, referring all things written by him to God alone, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired them to be printed, and made known to all Nations of the Earth, (as the laſt will of God.)</hi> Thereby taking all our fears upon himſelf wholly. <hi>The Preface, or Appeal to Gods Tribunal,</hi> goes before the Revelations.</p>
                  <p>And therefore ſeeing ſo great, learned and Godly a man, as <hi>Comenius,</hi> after ſo long deliberation, and conſultation with others, has thought it his duty to publiſh and dedicate them to all the world, let none think amiſs that they are thus ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily hinted in Engliſh; which very great uſe may be made of, however they prove, true, or falſe.</p>
                  <p>And the more to confirm <hi>Comenius</hi> herein, was, that <hi>Drabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi> was not alone, but <hi>two other Prophets of God</hi> had gone before, all teſtifying the ſame things for the main ſubſtance and ſcope thereof. The firſt was <hi>Cotterus</hi> a German, the ſecond <hi>Chriſtina</hi> a Polonian Gentlewoman. All whom, briefly thus, <hi>Comenius</hi> compares together.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <hi>(1.)</hi> In reſpect of their end, <hi>for which they were raiſed,</hi> viz. One and the ſame. To ſtir up the Godly to attend to the works of God, which he has now in hand, in purging his Church with the fire of Perſecutions, and ſoon after in reforming it gloriouſly, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging it through all the reſidue of the Nations of the World.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) <hi>In reſpect of time.</hi> Cotterus Viſions began before the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Pcrſecution (in <hi>Germany) An.</hi> 1616. and ended in their heat, 1624. <hi>Chriſtina's</hi> in the middle, about the time of Impriſonments, Apoſtaſies, and begun diſperſion of the Church. <hi>An.</hi> 1628 &amp; 1629. <hi>Drabricius's</hi> after their diſperſion,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:40863:97"/>
about the time of deliverance drawing on, and with it, from. 1638, to 1664. (and ſome continuations ſince to 1668.) For an Argument that God never forſakes his.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3.) <hi>If you compare them in reſpect of Age.</hi> The firſt was of full Age or mans eſtate, the ſecond young, the third old. For a Teſtimony, that tis indifferent with God, to uſe the Wit, Tongue, Hand, whether of Young, perfect Age, or Old.</p>
                  <p n="4">(4.) <hi>If in reſpect of Sex.</hi> The firſt and the third, Men; the middlemoſt a Virgin, to confirm that of <hi>Joel</hi> 2. 28.</p>
                  <p n="5">(5.) <hi>If in reſpect of Condition.</hi> The firſt was a Tradeſman, or Artizan, to be baniſhed afterwards for the Word of God. The ſecond a noble Virgin on both Parents ſide, born in Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to ſuffer new Baniſhment. The third a Miniſter of God's Word, ſetled in Baniſhment, and to be recalled out of Baniſhment.</p>
                  <p n="6">(6.) <hi>If in reſpect of their fitneſs hereunto.</hi> Cotterus altogether an Idiot, ignorant not only of writing, but of all things (except his Trade or-Craft, and a little knowledge of Religion) that are, or are done in the World. <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> could both read and write, and had learnt the Catechiſtical Principles of Religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but by her age uncapable of high things. <hi>Drabricius</hi> not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the Divine Scriptures, as became a Miniſter; but ſcarce acquainted with the Latin Tongue; and wholly ignorant of Philoſophy, Hiſtory, and all Sublimer things: For an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, That this is not a work of human wit, but of an higher Virtue, namely of the divine influx.</p>
                  <p n="7">(7.) <hi>If we conſider the manner of Revelation.</hi> They were made to <hi>Cotterus</hi> by Angels only. To <hi>Chriſtina</hi> by Angels, and the Lord himſelf. To <hi>Drabricius</hi> only by the Lord. And indeed to <hi>Cotterus</hi> ſometimes by <hi>Extaſies;</hi> yet for the moſt part by corporal Apparition of Angels to the outward ſenſes, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant health of Body. To <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> by perpetual Exſtaſies; yet her fleſh for the moſt part prepared thereunto and as it were mortified by antecedent pains. Then alſo by Dreams,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:40863:98"/>
and ſometimes with her corporeal Eyes and Ears. To <hi>Drabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi> by Dreams, and by and by, by a lively Voice ſounding in his Ears. The two firſt could remember to a word (before they were committed to writing) what they had ſeen and heard, if asked a thouſand times, not changing a very tittle. But <hi>Drabricius</hi> diſtruſting perpetually his own memory, was not able to write the things revealed, without the Lord repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, (and as it were dictating) unto him. Which we conjecture to be from hence, that their impreſſions came by extaſies, their minds being wholly abſtracted from ſenſe. But his ſenſes were left in their former ſtate, like to ours, &amp;c. For he had only firſt a Dream, and then a Voice when he was awak'd out of his dream, God ſpeaks after divers manners. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 1.</p>
                  <p n="8">(8) <hi>If we regard the form of ſpeech;</hi> the ſtile is every where pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick and Divine, yet in <hi>Cotterus</hi> more ſublime and high, in <hi>Chriſtina</hi> more low, in <hi>Drabricius</hi> more familiar.</p>
                  <p n="9">(9.) <hi>If we attend the Types and Figures uſed,</hi> in Prophecy, there are many in <hi>Cotterus,</hi> fewer in <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> ſcarce any in <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricius,</hi> or elſe preſently explained, &amp;c. <hi>Cotterus</hi> declaring the morning, as it were, break of day, riſing out of the deep of night; <hi>Chriſtina</hi> clear day light; <hi>Drabricius</hi>'s points out the Sun now riſing.</p>
                  <p n="10">(10.) <hi>As to their willingneſs to divulge theſe Revelations, and ſo to obey God in them,</hi> Cotterus reſiſted three whole years. <hi>Drabricius</hi> concealed his firſt Revelation five years; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reiterated again and again, he as often ſuppreſſed them a long time, till at length the Lyon roaring, they began to be afraid, and were compelled to prophecy, the Lord command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p n="11">(11.) <hi>If we reſpect the Opinion of men;</hi> All of them, were contemned and derided by ſome; wholly condemned by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.; as frantick, or Impoſtors; yet this could not ſtop the work.</p>
                  <p n="12">(12.) <hi>If we obſerve to whom they were ſent.</hi> They were all
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:40863:98"/>
ſent primarily to their own Nation. Secondarily alſo unto others. <hi>Cotterus</hi> unto the Germans; <hi>Chriſtina</hi> to the Polonians; <hi>Drabricius</hi> to the Hungarians; and from hence to all the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Earth, which they are all commanded to call unto, and declare the laſt Will of God unto all.</p>
                  <p n="13">(13.) <hi>If for what they were ſent:</hi> the two formoſt were ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply Prophets, foretelling things to come. But the laſt a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, preaching what ought to be done; exhorting to duty, and urging with promiſes and threatnings.</p>
                  <p n="14">(14.) <hi>They were all commanded to conceal their Propheſies for a time, or to communicate them only to the Godly,</hi> that were afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for their conſolation; yet at laſt not to hold their peace but to ſpeak to Kings, Princes, and all People, univerſally: For <hi>Cotterus</hi> was ſent to the Elector Palatine, King of <hi>Bohemia;</hi> and was heard in the preſence of the Grandees; as alſo to the Elector of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> more then once, but to the Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> did his errand by others, ſeveral times. <hi>Chriſtina</hi> could not but write Letters to the Duke of <hi>Fridland,</hi> and carry them her ſelf; as alſo <hi>Drabricius</hi> to the Princes of <hi>Tranſilvania.</hi> Therefore none of theſe things were done in a corner.</p>
                  <p n="15">(15.) <hi>All of them were commanded to ſpeak and do things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual, abſurd to reaſon, perilous to their lives;</hi> declaring a thing incredible to the States-men, the ſubverſion of the houſe of <hi>Auſtria;</hi> and to moſt of Divines offenſive, and ſcandalous, the deſtruction of the Pope before the laſt day, yet they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded conſtantly to ſpeak and write theſe things. <hi>Cotterus</hi> alſo to go to <hi>Glogovia</hi> where he knew he ſhould ſuffer bonds and priſon. <hi>Chriſtina</hi> to write terrible things againſt (the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial General) <hi>Walleſtein</hi> and carry them herſelf to his houſe; <hi>Drabricius</hi> to call the Nations together, againſt the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and Popedom, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="16">
                     <hi>(16.)</hi> They were all ſeverally examined by Divines, Phyſicians, Politicians and States-men, and intire Univerſities, Conſiſtories,

                  <p n="17">(17.) <hi>The laſt Revelation to Cotterus,</hi> which was of the tir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible execution of God's Judgement againſt the Babyloniſh Whore; to <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> which was againſt <hi>Walleſtein,</hi> (which had its effect) were made by Viſions in their ſleep; <hi>the laſt made to Drabricius</hi> (when he was firſt commanded to put to a cloſe) had its beginning in ſleep, but the reſt awake; and his Eyes open, being rouſed up by the clamors of the Jeſuits; undoubtedly to repreſent, that although all may ſeem to be but a dream, even to the Godly; yet it ſhall conclude in a real work and effect; that the world by ſeeing may ſee.</p>
                  <p n="18">
                     <hi>(18.)</hi> The two firſt Prophecies ended in ſilence, <hi>after they had been commanded once to ſeal them; ſuffering no more Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, nor did ſee the deliverance.</hi> But <hi>Drabricius</hi> after he was commanded to conclude, and dye; yet was again commanded to reſume both Life and a double Spirit to propheſie, &amp; received a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe not to ſee death, till <hi>he had ſeen the Glory of God ſpread up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Nations of the Earth.</hi>

                  <p>And for further confirmation, it might be ſhewn from Church hiſtory that the ſpirit of Prophecy hath alwayes been in the Church, and that in ſeveral ages God hath raiſed Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and ſent Viſions, and Revelations, unto men, But that it would be to large for the deſign of this preſent Table.

them for the main tending to the ſame thing with thoſe, Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, taxing the abominable Corruptions of the Roman Clergy, the whole Papacy, and Pope himſelf, and threatning deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction thereto; beſides many others more ordinarily inſpired and inlightened; And beſides the ſeveral particular Prophets every where, in each Country, concerning particular Nations, or Churches, &amp;c. And therefore if Papiſts, or thoſe inclined that way, ſhall ſlight theſe Propheſies, as out of another ſpirit; From what ſpirit then, have their own <hi>He and ſhe Saints,</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied, the ſame things; Therefore they may be their own Judges in this matter.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Machiavil</hi> himſelf was not ſuch an Atheiſt and Infidel, but that he acknowledged Gods uſual manner of foretelling all great Revolutions. I beſeech you, <hi>O Divines! ſaies <hi>Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> let not Politicians exceed you, in attention to the Words and Works of God; <hi>Machiavil,</hi> comparing former times with preſent, as he eaſily confeſſes, He knows not the cauſe; ſo he alſo ſayes it ought to be acknowledged out of all Ancient, and Modern Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; That all great Motions whatſoever, that have happened ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to a City, or a Country, have been wont to be foretold, by either Gueſſers and Conjecturers, or ſome Revelation, or Prodigies, or Signs in the Heavens.</hi> And confirms it by a domeſtick exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Charls the 8th. <hi>his coming into</hi> Italy, <hi>foretold by</hi> Savana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rola, <hi>that excellent man, and Martyr,</hi> &amp;c,</p>
                  <p>And more particularly to confirm alſo <hi>Cotterus</hi> and <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na's</hi> Revelations, there are further convincing Arguments, as well as for thoſe of <hi>Drabricius,</hi> which would be too Heterogene to inſert here fully.</p>
                  <p>Some of <hi>Cotterus's</hi> were ſeal'd in the Court three times, by particular relation from his own Mouth; The reſt by Godly and able men, worthy of credit, &amp;c. And this was wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that he had ſuch a Divine memory of all impreſſed into him, that he could recite each word, yea tittle, in the ſame or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, he heard them, although he ſhould recite them an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

times, which muſt needs be from ſome extraordinary underſtanding and illumination. And are all conſonant to truth, reſpect Gods Glory, and full of comfort. And in divers Viſions he (as the other two alſo) were incouraged not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard what men ſaid or thought thereon at all, which he urged to the Lord as his trouble and impediment, as may be ſeen no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably in divers Revelations, which we will paſs over with many other remarkable paſſages.</p>
                  <p>The chiefeſt enemy of <hi>Cotterus</hi> was one of the Emperial Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurers of the Exchequer,, who ſwore he would not reſt till he ſaw him and another Miniſter hanged; He was at laſt taken and brought before him, examined and at length committed to Priſon; All his writtings they could find ſeaſed on and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined. At length he was brought forth to Tryal and was queſtioned, <hi>From whom he had theſe Fictions that he vented un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of Viſions.</hi> But he conſtantly aſſerted, <hi>from no mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Wight, but from thoſe ſpirits which were wont to appear to him, and again, diſappeared. Which whether they were good or evil Angels he, a ſimple Idiot, could not judge; but left it to the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and Wiſe to do.</hi> The Earle that ſeized on him inclined to diſmiſs him on certain conditions. But the Treaſurer refuſed and was more violent; And the other Miniſter queſtion'd for his life. That with his moſt lying Pen abuſing the ſimplicity of a phanatick man, he had written Treaſon againſt the Emperor, who excuſed that what they had done was by the command of the Senate. But the Senate bailed their Paſtor, under the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of two thouſand Gold Crowns to appear; but <hi>Cotterus,</hi> the Treaſurer committed to cloſer priſon, till he was almoſt famiſhed. An entire volumn of his Viſions was by his enemyes brought to the Earl, who when he had read them, would no more meddle in the buſineſs, and procured that <hi>Cotterus</hi> ſhould have counſel to defend himſelf. The definitive Sentence was not known; for the Treaſurer being newly Marryed to a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Lady, upon ſome occaſions went a journey, and in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:40863:100"/>
was ſuddenly taken with vehement gripings of the belly, one evening in the very Suburbs of <hi>Sprottavia</hi> (where he threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened to ſee him hanged with the Miniſter) and poſſeſſed with I know not what fear, would take nothing preſcribed by the Phyſitians that was called; But would defer it till next day, that his diſeaſe might better diſcover it ſelf; <hi>but dyed ſuddenly in the night,</hi> There, where he had purpoſed to hang thoſe Saints of God; which raiſed a terror in all the City, &amp;c. So that his Enemyes being hereby terrified, durſt not publiſh the Sentence againſt him, but uſed him better in priſon, and with more freedom to himſelf, and acceſs of his Wife and Friends; who urged his diſmiſſion or execution; ſo that his adverſaries be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing never at reſt, after ſome months deliberation, brought him forth out of priſon, ſet him in the Pillory, in the Market place bound him in an Iron Collor, and a paper affixed on his head, <hi>This is the falſe prophet who hath foretold thoſe things which are not come to paſs:</hi> And ſo was ſent away out of the City, by the common Executinor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Baniſhed, and lived ſo twenty years, &amp;c. Not long after the former Miniſter, and another friend of <hi>Cotterus,</hi> had likewiſe a mervellous deliverance (by apparition of an Angel;) out of the City upon the Imperial Armies en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cotterus</hi> alſo had a Miraculous Cure and Recovery from an Epidemical Diſtemper, which had ſeized on him, (with his Wife, Daughter, and another of the houſe, ſo that they all lay down of it; At which time his Wife alſo ſaw one of the Spirits enter the Room one evening. She asked her Husband who it was; who ſaid, it was one of the Spirits, that were wont to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to him.</p>
                  <p>The Spirit wiſhing health to him, asked him how he did. As a poor miſerable man can be, ſaid he, whom the Lord hath viſited. The Spirit then ſaid, Be of good chear, God will raiſe thee up. Cut thee three morſels of Bread, Eat, and take three ſpoonfuls of Ale, the diſeaſe will leave thee. He did ſo, and
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:40863:101"/>
was rap't into an Extaſie and had Viſions, &amp;c. And after retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to himſelf, was wholly well.</p>
                  <p>We muſt alſo paſs over the innumerable wonderful things, that in particular concern <hi>Chriſtina</hi> likewiſe, &amp; her Extaſies and Viſions, &amp;c. As (1.) how ſhe was wonderfully reſtored from her grievous diſtempers on a ſudden, by a Voice, in her Exta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, ſaying, <hi>I am he which kill, and make alive;</hi> at which (as at all the reſt following) the Phyſitians were confounded. (2.) That being an healthful young Virgin, ſhe was ſuddenly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the uſe of her feet, for ſix weeks, and not able to ſtand a moment, and without any help<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſuddenly reſtored by a Viſion. (3.) That ſhe was ſuddenly ſtruck dumb, for eight dayes, and on a ſudden alſo reſtored to ſpeech. (4.) Suddenly ſtruck Deaf, and Dumb, with a Feaver, and Delirium, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain ſuddenly recovered in her Extaſie and Viſion. (5.) In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable pains, torments and diſquietments on a ſudden, and in a moment delivered in an Extaſie. (6.) Horrible and deſperate temptations of the Devil, overcome &amp; vanquiſh'd wonderfully, by the Divine Power and Preſence with her in her Viſions or Extaſies in more then an ordinary manner. (7.) Something inflicted by Gods immediate hand in a Viſion, to remain all the dayes of her life to humble her; but ſhe diſcovered not what it was. (8.) Her <hi>wonderful Death</hi> and indeed <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> as we may ſay. All which <hi>her Tutour Comenius</hi> was an Eye witneſs of. This laſt we will give you more fully and particularly, for the confirmation of all.</p>

                                 <p>She underwent ſeveral examinations, firſt of her Father, a ſolid Divine, and moſt violent oppoſer of Neoterick Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; who endeavoured both by Letters, dehortations, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations, and ſevere threatnings to ſtop her; till by all her an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, and his own Eyes, <hi>he apprehended the error to be in himſelf, and gave glory to God.</hi> The next, was of Divines, Politicians, Phyſitians, inquiring moſt curiouſly into all things; but could find nothing but <hi>the Finger of God,</hi> &amp;c. Then by the Paſtors and Elders of the Church at the hour of her death, as before. And the worſt of all was of the Devil, both at the beginning, and afterwards ſeveral times, undergoing horrible temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp;c. Beſides all the Divine Tryals, and Teſtimonies, &amp;c.</p>
                                 <p>Very remarkable alſo was the Devils Mock-Games, that he played about this time by raiſing other falſe extaſies in ſome. Whereof <hi>Comenius</hi> mentions two.

Hereby it was thought that God had raiſed up others in like manner to confirm the ſame things. But after ſtrict

                                 <p>But more cunningly the Devil plaid his part at <hi>Geneva</hi> the ſame year, whereby the Learned there were for a time preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced againſt theſe Revelations; when as before both <hi>Diodat, Vedelius and others</hi> by letters approved them.

her own perſon, alwayes came to paſs. But for thoſe things which concerned the World or the Church, although they may ſeem contrary, yet becauſe there ſeems to be a diſpoſing of Providence towards the accompliſhment of the main: we may ſay with St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> (ſays <hi>Comenius) when many things are fulfilled, He is preverſe who contemns a Prophet. Divine Propheſies,</hi> ſaid a great man, <hi>alwayes ſmell of their Author, to whom a thouſand years are but as one day, and one day a thouſand years.</hi> And about the events of Propheſies there are three cautions. (1.) of <hi>Chryſoſtom, That all Propheſies are not fulfilled to Senſe, and the Letter,</hi> &amp;c. and he inſtances out of Scripture. Thus <hi>Jacob</hi> who received ſo many Bleſſings from his Father, ſcarce injoyed one, &amp;c. (2.) Of <hi>Grotius, that for ſome things not fulfilled, are not to be called in queſtion thoſe things that are clearly fulfilled.</hi> As the Jews bring many things obſcure, or that receive a divers ſignification concerning the Meſſiah; for which thoſe that are manifeſt ought not to be denyed. (3.) Of God, <hi>To believe in Hope againſt Hope;</hi> and not paſs raſh judgement through un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief on Divine predictions, though they never appear to our apprehenſion, &amp;c. <hi>for Gods thoughts are not as our thoughts,</hi> &amp;c. Again, all things were not evidently fulfilled to appearance, to the Ancient Prophets. Therefore deriders ſaid, <hi>Where is the Word of the Lord, let it come,</hi> &amp;c. Jer. 17. 15. But God does not want cauſes, to defer his promiſes, or threatnings, or to change them, and has been pleaſed to render reaſons. <hi>Jona</hi> 4. <hi>Jer.</hi> 18. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 30. Beſides <hi>we underſtand not as his Works, ſo neither his Words,</hi> till performed, and that not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 2. 5. <hi>John</hi> 16. <hi>The Beginning of a thing is taken with God for the thing it ſelf.</hi> God meaſures dayes and hours, not as we. That which is not fulfilled to day, may be to morrow. As <hi>Ninive</hi> after fourty years: though not fourty dayes. Gods Mercy is ſo great, that he ſeems to appear falſe, rather then not merciful. If, laſtly, events do'nt anſwer, blame man as ſome way faulty. Thus <hi>Comenius.</hi> And <hi>Drabricius</hi> himſelf in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

Viſions, is advertiz'd to the ſame ſenſe and purpoſe, &amp;c. But theſe things have been hinted once and again before.</p>
                                 <p>But Behold the Atheiſtical age! who think God reveals nothing now unto men. All humble and ſober obſervance of extraordinary Signs, Dreams, Extaſies, prophetick Inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Angelical Apparitions, Prodigies in the Heavens, &amp;c. (As Comets, New Stars, Suns, unuſual Tempeſts, Sights of Armies fighting in the Air, Sounds of Drums and Trumpets, &amp;c.) paſſes for fooliſh ſuperſtition or fancy. And all is attributed either only to natural cauſes, or chance, or vain imagination, and nothing to God. Which God grievouſly complains of, <hi>Amos</hi> 4. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. This is the laſt ſecurity of the World, that Faith will not be found on Earth, &amp;c. And as in the dayes of <hi>Noah</hi> (when all were ſo ſecure) ſo it ſhall be in the laſt dayes, all things ſhall be full of Prodigies in Heaven, and Earth, of Bloud, Fire, and Smoke; of Dreams, Viſions, and Propheſies. <hi>Joel</hi> 2. 28. &amp;c. <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. And things ſpeak as much; ſo many various Prodigies in our age in Heaven Earth, Sea, and ſeveral Creatures, were never in any Age be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; even in <hi>Germany</hi> alone, within this half Century, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have been noted and recorded of this kind, as never the like. And of <hi>England</hi> the ſame, &amp;c. Surely God means hereby to have men warned of greater and more wondrous works of his providence ſhortly to follow. Nor were ever more Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and divinely inſpired, then in this Age; at leaſt ſince the Apoſtacy of the Church. For there were and are, Men and Women, Old and Young, Noble and Ignoble, Learned and Unlearned, Clergy and Secular, who have had true prophetick Dreams, Illuminations, Raptures, Angelical Apparitions, and ſpeakings with God; who have ſpoken and written unuſual things of the enkindled Wrath of God, of approaching Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the Univerſal change of Things. Eſpecially in <hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> where the terrible Perſecutions of the Church were foretold to begin. Of whom ſixteen, that had Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions

and Revelations, and alſo printed, <hi>Comenius</hi> reckons up. And it is not unknown that of late, and now, there are Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick ſpirits in <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c.

The one a plain Country man,</hi> to whom, at his work in the Field, an Augel of the Lord appeared, An. <hi>1625. The other a Taylor, who from 1625. to 1628.</hi> had a certain voice ſounding round about him, revealing things to come, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding him to write them. And at length an Angel in a viſible form appeared unto him, <hi>to take his farewel, with theſe words;</hi> Becauſe thou ſo much deſireſt to ſee me, although I am by nature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible, &amp;c.</p>

Let it ſuffice our Church once to have dared what no univerſity or Conſiſtory before us hath at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted, to paſs a Condemnatory Sentence againſt theſe things. Let it ſuffice I ſay, and ſerve for a caution. I, if it ſhall pleaſe the Lord to call me hence, will ſeal it with my Death; that I have forwarned that the Church no more offend in this kind; And that

                  <p>Drabricius <hi>in his Viſions, had promiſed him an Aſſociate, called</hi> his Adjunct, <hi>to help carry on this work of God in the World, which</hi>
                     <pb n="208" facs="tcp:40863:107"/>
                     <hi>was this</hi> Comenius. <hi>And indeed who ſo ſit? And firſt he was commanded by the Lord to inform</hi> Comenius <hi>of his firſt Viſions, and to ſend them to him; which accordingly he did, about</hi> An. 1644. <hi>And this was all that ever</hi> Comenius <hi>had to do concerning them, till</hi> 1650. <hi>when after that the General Peace of</hi> Munſter <hi>ſeemed to defeat all their hopes and expectations,</hi> Comenius <hi>was by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence unexpectedly brought into thoſe Parts again, about Affairs of the Church. There</hi> Drabricius <hi>was urgent with him to go to the Prince; He replyed.</hi> What do you hear, my Brother; Are not you awake yet out of your Dreams? <hi>(Condemning, as well as others all of Vanity, Becauſe they did not reach the prophetick gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of Stile like</hi> Cotterus's <hi>and</hi> Chriſtina's, <hi>and the events ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to anſwer much leſs)</hi> You firſt offer'd the Crown to the Father, and now deluded of that Hope, you would go to the Son. In the name of God, ſee what you do; and deſiſt to delude your ſelf and others. <hi>The man ſhed Tears, and lifting up his Eyes and Hands,</hi> I could twice waſh my ſelf, with my Tears, <hi>ſayes he,</hi> As much as has already been powred forth of them, that God would ſpare me miſerable man; But I cannot obtain. <hi>Have you then Viſions yet, ſaid</hi> Comenius? It is a bove a year, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> that I have had none; yet I know, that there is not an end of them. <hi>How do you know?</hi> The Lord told me, <hi>ſayes he;</hi> and commanded that they ſhould be ſealed, and kept for your coming, and delivered to you. For that you ſhould come into this Land; Behold! Here, I deliver them; and beſought him to read them. Do not you faigne this I pray, <hi>ſaid Comeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</hi> He calls God to witneſs! <hi>Comenius asked, when did you hear that concerning my coming hither?</hi> Three years ſince, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> preſently after the Princes death, when through impatience of theſe mockeries, I would have burnt thoſe. But the Lord for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad; you will find it there written.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Comenius</hi> upon Meditation, Prayer, and Conference with Friends, found his mind changed. So many cauſes, offering themſelves for taking a Journey to the Prince, which before
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:40863:107"/>
he had not obſerved. And calling his Brethren to pray toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he did accordingly, &amp;c. And ſo afterwards the Viſions returned to <hi>Drabricius</hi> again, more ſolemn then before; and ever ſince to this time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In which at diveres times</hi> Comenius <hi>was</hi> commanded from the Lord to write them; to tranſlate them into the Latin Tongue, to divulge them ſpeedily, through all publick places, and ſtreets of the World; to tranſlate the Bible into the Turkiſh Language; to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate them to Kings, and Princes, and all Orders of men; and being backward and wavering, was ſtill commanded, preſſed, and threatned to go on, to write and publiſh them, and to invocate and to cry aloud upon all Nations of the Earth, in order to the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment, and execution of theſe things, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>All which this Adjunct of the Lords Prophet (not daring to tergiverſate, or be diſobedient to Gods call) has done, as well as he could, or is about to do; and durſt not but do.</p>
                  <p>Accordingly therefore this excellent Man begins with the dedication and conſecration of the whole to Chriſt Jeſus him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and an appeal to him, <hi>The Eternal Word, Wiſdom, and Truth</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Hear us King of Glory! now crying unto thee, for thy Glory ſake; and thou who art our Sun, ſhew us clearly to all under the Sun, as the clear Sun doth all things viſible at noon day, what there is in theſe leaves; whether it be thy Light and Truth, or the frauds of thy black Enemy! Amen! Amen! Amen! O Light of the World! we appeal, in expoſing this thy Cauſe, to the publick view of men, againſt the Prince of Darkneſs; we appeal from the Darkneſs to the Light; from the prejudice of fools, to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the wiſe; from the raſhneſs of the prophane, to the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the Godly; from the ill informed to the better informed; finally, from every humane Tribunal, to thy Tribunal it ſelf! Thou King of Kings, in whoſe hands are the hearts of King, as Rivers of Water, to turn them which way thou wilt, give unto all that ſhall go about to judge of theſe things, a teachable heart, like <hi>Solomons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>If any thing yet remain to be done ſeriouſly about theſe things, this one thing is it, <hi>By an accurate and ſolemn Inquiſition to examine,</hi> whether theſe things be truly ſo, or no; <hi>or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther humane figments only,</hi> cover'd with the <hi>Cloak of divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations?</hi> and that then, if any fraud be detected, <hi>the falſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to be puniſhed</hi> according to the Laws of God and man.</p>
                  <p>We fly therefore to your Tribunal, O Kings, for ſuch a ſcruting! beſeeching you all by the adorable name of God, to ſuffer your ſelves to be perſwaded, that nothing under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven greater can at this time be undertaken and performed by you, <hi>then this very queſtion</hi> to be determined; <hi>Is it the Voice of God that ſounds here, or no,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                     <hi>Seeing O Kings, Princes, Common-wealths! your duties are here ſet before your eyes, with wholeſome Counſels, for the publick ſafty, be you</hi> intreated in the name of God, and by your own, and the Worlds ſalvation, <hi>this thing in the firſt place,</hi> to take theſe very Books into your protection, and command them to be expoſed openly through all the Book-ſellers Shops of your Kingdoms and Provinces, as freely as any other Books whatever of good note; Inſtilling into the Chriſtian People, the fear of God, reverence of Kings, and amendment of life; <hi>As freely I ſay (as other Books of this nature) as the Book of the three men, and three ſpritual Virgins,</hi> Hermis Paſtoris, Ugutine <hi>the Monk, Fryar</hi> Robert; <hi>and</hi> Hildegard, Elizabeth, <hi>and</hi> Mathilda, <hi>publiſhed by</hi> Jacob Faber <hi>at</hi> Paris, <hi>1513.

                  <p>Hear O Kings, Princes, Common-wealths and every Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer among Chriſtian People, this Book which is offered to you ſtirs you up againſt no man, but exhorts you all in the name of God to do your duty in ſtopping the confuſions brought in by

Satan, and reſtoring the order inſtituted from God. As yet promiſing Benediction if you yet admit counſel, or denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the laſt Wrath, Plagues and Deſtruction, if you yet harden your ſelves. Let the fear of the Lord therefore be with you, and deligently put in execution all things. It is your glory O Kings to be nurſing Fathers, &amp;c. and alſo it is your Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to reſtrain any. Church, that, degenerating into Babylon, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes fierceneſs &amp; cruelty: and if the Spouſe of Chriſt, putting on a whoriſh dreſs, waxes wanton, to hate the Whore, and make her deſolate and naked, and to eat her fleſh, and burn her with Fire; God putting it into your hearts to do his pleaſure. And no longer to give your Kingdoms to the Beaſt, till the Word of God be finiſhed <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.—But behold in our times the words of all the Propheſies old and new are conſummated, which the univerſal commotion of Nations, which you ſee, and the univerſal change of things, which you ſhall ſhorrly ſee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> do witneſs. Ho! therefore take again unto you your power, and leave not your Scepters any longer, in a ſtrange and wrong hand; I have commanded you, O Kings and Princes, that you your ſelves Govern; For you have even your name from me <hi>(Gods on the Earth)</hi> not from an Angel, or any creature, ſaies the Word of God to <hi>Drabricius,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>But what muſt you do when you take unto you your power, O Kings? That very thing which the King of Kings (whoſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters you are at this time) requires of you, TO REFORM THE WORLD AND ALL THINGS IN IT, THROUGH ALL NATIONS. For he who has long ſince, by the mouths of his moſt holy Prophets ſaid, that he would make all things new, on you O Kings, as his Vicegerents, he confers this Honor, that this glorious Renovation be begun by your happy undertaking, and be done by your Co-work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Authority, through the whole world.</p>

great Tribulation, ſuch as hath not been from the begining of the World, nor ever ſhall be.</p>
                  <p>O ye Sons in high places! now God ariſes to judge the Earth and to take his inheritance in all Nations!</p>
                  <p>5thly. If upon univerſal repentance God ſpare you, <hi>a moſt ſolemn reformation and amendment of things is to be thought of.</hi> Inquire into the Books of the Lord, old and new; hear your <hi>St. Bridgets</hi> moſt excellent counſel, when <hi>St. Bernard</hi> inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the counſel of God from her. <hi>He that ſat upon the Throne opening his mouth ſaid, Hear all my enemies, living in the World!</hi> (becauſe I ſpeak not to my Friends, who follow my will) <hi>hear all Clergy men, Arch Biſhops, Biſhops, and all inferior orders of the Church! hear all Religious and Regulars of what ſoever order! hear Kings and Princes and Judges of the Earth! and all Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtirs and Subjects. Hear Women, Queens, and Princeſſes, and all Ladies, Miſtreſſes and Servants,</hi> and all of what ſoever order and degree, great, and ſmall, that inhabit the world, theſe words which I, even I who have created you, now ſpeak unto you &amp;c.—After complaining of all their ſins, impieties and vices—Therefore I ſwear by my Deity, that if you dye in the ſtate wherein you are, you ſhall never ſee my face, nor eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape my puniſhments, &amp;c.—Therefore return ye unto me with humiliations, and I will receive you graciouſly as Sons, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And therefore for ſuch an univerſal and ſerious return, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſerious and ſolemn thoughts once at length are to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred upon, counſel is given you <hi>even in theſe Books,</hi> O Kings! <hi>of convocating an UNIVERSAL COUNCIL out of all Chriſtian People,</hi> Holily to conſpire together in a common univerſal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and univerſal ſerious deprecating, and amendment of ſo great exorbitances now among us, &amp;c. and to return all from curioſities and niceties about Articles and Queſtions of Faith which hath diſtracted us, and from the many<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by-paths of error which we are run into, and from earthly deſires and luſts
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:40863:111"/>
which have led us away into mutual ſtrifes and Wars; unto the ſimplicity and puriry of the Chriſtian Faith and Life. That all Chriſtian Diſſenſions, Strifes, Hatreds, Wars, Devourings and Deſtroyings, may be changed into Concord, Peace, Love<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Safety and Felicity; and to this, <hi>the only way is a COUNCIL truly univerſal, truly free, truly congregated in the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>—Ariſe, O Chriſtian Kings! help things every where grown deſperate! <hi>the Patronage of this Book belongs to Kings,</hi> becauſe it comes <hi>in the name of the King of Kings, (and is print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with priviledge of the King of Kings, and committed to the favor of all the Kings of the Earth every where to ſpread and divulge it) and contains nothing hurtful to any; but profitable, and moſt uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If you hear not theſe divine counſels, O Chriſtians! the Lord will ſend more Plagues, Inteſtine Wars, Famine, Plague, Savage Beaſts,</hi> i. e. <hi>Men worſe then Beaſts;</hi> ſo that Chriſtians ſhall be more ſavage, and rage one againſt another more inhumanly, then Turks and Barbarians, becauſe the condemnation of the great Whore is at hand.</p>
                  <p>—Not for our ſelves, O Kings and Princes! do we, the Publiſhers of this Book, require your protection thereof; <hi>but for your ſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Chriſtian People, leſt you periſh from the fury of all the divine premointions. It is comfort and protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on enough to us, from God, who can boldly ſay, with</hi> Hilde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardis, I have both ſpoke and writ theſe things not according to the invention of my own heart, or of any man; but as I have ſeen, heard, and perceived them in the Heavenly places (or viſions) through the ſecret myſteries of God.—Therefore, hear ye! who preſide in the place of God on Earth! undertake ſo to manage this cauſe of God againſt Satan or of Satan, againſt God <hi>(for ſo diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent perſons interpret differently)</hi> that it may be ended, and none may err concerning theſe things. <hi>This lyes upon you upon a double right. 1ſt. becauſe you are Kings. 2dly.

Therefore conſtitute, forthwith a Judgement, O ye who judge the Earth, wherein may be decided, whether our God, <hi>that hath pity towards us all in common,</hi> ſpeakes here things profitable to his Reaple, or ſome Devil inſtil things hurtful.</p>
                  <p>—If the latter, that the falſe prophets and fainers of dreams may be put to death, and iniquity be taken away from the midſt of the people; <hi>Deut. 13.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And,</hi> becauſe the Ecleſiaſticks are ordinarily inclined to ſlay the Prophets, behold! we ſolemnly appeal from all Univerſities and Conſiſtories to your tribunal, O Kings, and ſecular Powers. <hi>Like</hi> Jeremiah <hi>from the Prieſts to the Princes, and to the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and</hi> Paul <hi>the Apoſtle, from the Council of the Prieſts, to the Political Judges,</hi> Felix, Feſtus, Agrippa, <hi>and laſtly to</hi> Caeſar <hi>himſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We beſeech you undertake, 1ſt. the Patronage of this Book. <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting none to rage againſt it,</hi> till plenary examination and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion of the cauſe. For what, have theſe papers offended in recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving theſe Lamentations, Mournings, and Woes? <hi>eſpecially de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing no ſad things to the people of God: But to</hi> Sodom, Egypt, Babylon, <hi>the World, Hell and the Devils afflicting the people of God.</hi> Nor perſwade any Nation or any Man, any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt their Kings, but all Loyalty; that all things <hi>may return from all manner of confuſions, into all manner of order and peace. Laſtly, becauſe</hi> This Book is one of them by which God Convocates the Kings of the Earth, from the four Corners of the World to reverence him, it is your part therefore O Kings! not to hinder but promote this Trumpet of God, if you would be Miniſters of his Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Next,</hi> The publiſhers themſelves of this Book commend themſelves to your Patronage, O Gods, Protectors of the Earth! <hi>That you permit no unjuſt violence againſt them. As the Princes and the King himſelf did not againſt</hi> Jeremiah, <hi>and</hi> Baruch, <hi>nor the Tribune of the Band, and</hi> Felix <hi>Governor of</hi> Judea, <hi>againſt</hi> Paul. For it would be moſt unjuſt, by force to act any thing againſt

him, who appealing to Juſtice, ſets himſelf before the Judgement. <hi>As the Jewiſh Prieſts with their flatterers did againſt the Lord himſelf, and againſt</hi> Paul, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <hi>3.</hi> We commend to you, O Powers of the Earth! the very cauſe it ſelf pleaded in theſe Books, to be throughly examined; for in the name of one more powerful, theſe Oracles do come fulminating, your People, your Prieſts, and your Selves with your Princes, and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all the inhabitants of the Modern World to a certain ſupreme inviſible, yet terrible Tribunal.—For if the words which theſe Books denounce, be truly the words of God, it is more Glorious then any thing yet in the Church ſince the Apoſtles time. If Satanical Impoſtures, they are more terrible and fearful ones, then ever any have yet been. If figments of humane craft, nothing like hath ever yet come forth in any Nation by any humane wit. But whether this, or that, or the other, It is a matter moſt worthy of the care of Kings, that at length what it is may appear, <hi>whereunto ſerious Judgement is needful: not neglect, not contempt, not fury.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Haſten, O Kings! to know and examine what matter of things theſe are, before all the Plagues here denounced be powred forth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your Kingdoms.—Deliver theſe things to wiſe men, and fearing God, and of publick ſpirits, ſeriouſly to be weighed. If you hear humane counſels, why not alſo theſe, which many wayes may appear to come by men indeed, yet not from men.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If any one ſay;</hi> Dare you broach, and vend theſe things for Propheſies undoutedly Divine? <hi>I will anſwer with</hi> Philip <hi>to</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaniel, <hi>Come and ſee! For the offices and marks of true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets are here (to declare to the people of God, fallen into abominations, their ſins. To denounce wrath and puniſhment to the impenitent, and again Mercy and Grace to the penitent) this, and not another thing (for the main ſcope and end) you ſhall ſee, is done here. Only be ſure to ſee, that you make your ſelves certain (which you may from the adjoyned hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) (1ſt.)</hi> That there have been really and indeed perſons in this
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:40863:112"/>
our Age who have written theſe things greater then any human wit. <hi>(2</hi>ly.) And that they were ſimple Idiots, not able to fain ſuch things. <hi>(Act. 4. 13.) (3</hi>ly.) And Godly, fearing God, not willing to deceive. <hi>(4</hi>ly.) Incompaſſed with a cloud of Witneſſes, that there could be no place for Impoſtures. <hi>(5</hi>ly.) Laſtly, that many Godly and ſolid Divines, not in one Nation only, do give teſtimony that greater wiſedom ſhines forth in theſe things then that they can be attributed to men; and that the whole work, is more ſanctions and holy <hi>then that it can be attributed to Satan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Yet leſt we may ſeem to obtrude any private Authority on the Publick,</hi> we earneſtly intreat a publick and ſolemn examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe things, under your Auſpicions beginnings, O Kings. And that as ſoon as may be, while witneſſes are alive, who can give it on their Faith, that they have ſeen the fingers writing, <hi>viz.</hi> Things flowing forth or droping from the pen of the Seers, not what they themſelves would, but what, (by themſelves for the moſt part not underſtood) ſome certain inviſible dictatour inſtilled into them; which alſo their own hand writing, <hi>viz.</hi> The originals themſelves, kept in a certain place, further teſtifie.</p>
                  <p>The laſt thing we deſire of you, O moſt ſerene Princes, is, that if theſe be Counſels divine, you would ſeriouſly purpoſe and reſolve to obey and execute the divine Will, ſaying, All that the Lord hath ſaid, we will do.</p>
                  <p>—Why may not theſe things be thus recommended, &amp;c. ſeeing no man brings them forth of his own daring; but they are offered in the name of God, who is the God of all, and takes care of all. It is the Law of Arms and cuſtom of the Nations, that Trumpeters paſs freely amongſt the moſt deadly enemies, even ready to give Battel, bringing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of their Principals. Why may not he therefore be ſafe between the ſafeguards of your Majeſty, O Chriſtian Kings! <hi>who is your Interpreter from the King of Kings?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But they who would perſwade you that this Book is hurtful, ſtirring up to War, and Arms; betray their folly, malice, and
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:40863:113"/>
impiety. Becauſe it does not make; but (after the manner of all the Prophets) forewarn denounce, and threaten Wars and Deſolations, without Repentence, and Amendment. And becauſe none has ever drawn his Sword for the ſake of this Book, when yet all people draw their Swords one againſt another; who is ſo blind yet, and beſotted, as not to ſee his Arm ſtretched forth, out of whoſe mouth are denounced theſe things beforehand.

As <hi>Johannes de Rupeſciſsâ,</hi> and others whom you impriſoned. <hi>Mancinellus</hi> whoſe hands and tongue you cut off. <hi>Hus, Savanarola,</hi> and others, whom you burnt. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though even ſome alſo you had canoniz'd and their Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and externally honour'd for Saints, who will witneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you.—</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>O</hi> Alexander the ſeventh, <hi>to you I appeal by name, and moſt humbly pray you</hi> to admit theſe words or ſpeeches. As God lives, and your ſoul lives, I ſeek nothing in this Book, or this new Edition thereof, but that the Chriſtian People with all their Prelates, may prevent the laſt Wrath of God. <hi>They are ſerious things, and concern the Chriſtian Peoples ſafety, or deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. By the tremendous Name of God, I pray, do not ſet them at nought.—</hi>

                           <hi>Peter</hi> could erre; why not <hi>Peter</hi>'s ſucceſſor? <hi>Peter</hi> could be admoniſhed of his error by Collegues; Why not alſo <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſors? <hi>Peter</hi> did not bear diſdainfully his admonition, yea ſharp rebuke; nor let <hi>Peters</hi> Succeſſor.—</p>
                        <p>—Therefore <hi>Alexander,</hi> higheſt Prieſt! ſuffer ſomething to be ſaid—I will deal plainly with you in the name of co-Brothers, all the Biſhops of the world, and in the name of the whole Chriſtian People—<hi>whether theſe three Prophets of ours, were truly ſent of God and commanded to ſpeak, what they ſpake.</hi> It is not enough to deny; but come to examine.—Whilſt therefore ſad things are here denounced againſt you, O Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Pope! <hi>in theſe Books, do not I beſeech you ſuſpect any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of men have here conſpired againſt you. Whether in jeſt and ſport, as your Paſquin and Morphory at</hi> Rome; <hi>or in earneſt. Examine before you contemn.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>—<hi>Thou, O Roman Pope! yet be entreated. If you are reſolved to imitate</hi> Ahab, <hi>the ſlayer of the Prophets; yet at leaſt imitate his prudence and policy;</hi> i. e. Be not more cruel towards theſe three Prophets ſpeaking to you, and the word by the command of God; then <hi>Ahab, towards his three,</hi> Elias, Anony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, <hi>and</hi> Micheas. <hi>1</hi> Kings. ch. <hi>18. and 20, 22.</hi> Elias <hi>requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all</hi> I ſrael <hi>to be gathered together, to ſee whether God was God, or</hi> Baal. Ahab <hi>conſented, was himſelf a ſpectator.</hi> You have ſought us, O Roman Prelates! (whom you thought diſturbers of your affairs,) through all Nations and Kingdoms by your Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions and Inquiſitions. But they, behold! ready of their own accord, by command of God, ſet themſelves before you, to try, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God be God, or <hi>Baal.</hi> And that all the Chriſtian People be congregated into Council, to this ſpectacle. Stand to this therefore. Admit a juſt requeſt. Gather a Convention together. Behold the event!—<hi>All your Counſellors, with your falſe prophets, promiſe happy</hi> Omens <hi>to you, as they did to</hi> Ahab. But behold here ſome <hi>Michea's,</hi> who have heard another thing. Are they not to be heard alſo? <hi>Joſaphat perſwades.</hi> Nor let him who is not more
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:40863:119"/>
obdurate then <hi>Ahab,</hi> refuſe. The event will ſhew, whence theſe things come. And it is juſt, that all People be called as Witneſſes. It ought to appear plainly by the publick teſtimony of the world, if there be any true God, and true Prophet of the true God, or no. We ſend theſe words, as <hi>Micheas's,</hi> to all people, that they may be heard of all.—<hi>O</hi> Alexander <hi>Pope! humble thy ſelf in Sackcloath, and Aſhes; and command all in your great</hi> Nineveh, <hi>ſo to do; If yet perchance at laſt, God may return, and pardon, leſt ye periſh.</hi>—</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Pope</hi> Alexander! <hi>from the beginning of the World,</hi> the Light of the divine Word, <hi>hath never ſo clearly ſhone,</hi> nor ſo many Prodigies <hi>broak forth in Heaven and Earth,</hi> nor ſo many extraordinary Revelations and Propheſies; Nor ſo many and ſo univerſal Commotions of the Nations, <hi>and Deſtructions, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities following them, and to follow.</hi> Wo unto you, if you lead the World to deſpiſe all theſe things.—Be moved at the ſight of this Book!—<hi>O Pope, be but in deed what you are in name, The Head of the Church! Succeſſor of the Apoſtles! Vicar of Chriſt! and all will be well and ſafe.—Lay down the Arms of the World. Put on the Arms of the Church; of the Apoſtles; of Chriſt. You ſhall as certainly overcome as they overcame—Pope</hi> Alexander <hi>7</hi>th! <hi>wiſe Pope! command</hi> St. Hildegards <hi>Viſion to be ſhown you.—And you will ſee,</hi> nothing is ſaid againſt you here; but what hath been ſaid by your own Saints and Prophets before. <hi>And for that reaſon never harden your ſelf againſt</hi> ſo great obteſtations of God,—both old and new. Although you burn theſe Books; or reject them amongſt the prohibited Books, or take no notice of them; yet they will have their effect, for which they are ſent.</p>
                        <p>Whoſoever of you, O Cardinals, Biſhops, Prelats, Fathers of the ſociety! have acceſs to the Pope, perſwade him, <hi>not to be too haſty, to condemn this Book</hi> (that perſwades only ſuch things) <hi>as an Heretick or Phanatick Book.</hi> Let him rather read, or thoſe that are ſincere amongſt you give it him to read, &amp;c. We read
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:40863:119"/>
your Books of all kinds, <hi>even your Revelations from God.</hi> Why not you alſo, theſe things which ours, the ſame God, (for we have no other) hath vouchſafed to reveal to us? And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him that he may ſay to himſelf and you, Let us ſearch our wayes, and turn unto the Lord.—To whom for a final determination, <hi>Whether this be his Word or anothers, we muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily appeal on both ſides, as</hi> Elias <hi>and</hi> Micheas <hi>did.</hi> But <hi>Ahab</hi> and the People ſtood ſtill.—</p>
                        <p>If you perſiſt, and refuſe to follow the Examples of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Apoſtles, what will follow? Nothing elſe will remain, then either to oppoſe new Counſel, more crafty than former; or new and greater force: But either, or both, alike in vain. As <hi>Caiphas</hi> the High-Prieſt of the Jews, did uſe both in vain; In whoſe footſteps if it pleaſe you ſtill to inſiſt, Do what he did; Convocate Cardinals, Patriarchs, Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Abbats, Doctors, and propound to them, How no means hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto uſed, avail any thing. And that now moreover, a new danger is ariſen, <hi>from new Revelations publiſhed,</hi> if they be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted for Divine; <hi>which deliver the power of Judging and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the Church unto Kings. Reformation (that unſeen Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation) heretofore attempted by Paedants only, or certain Monks (Waldus, Wickliff, Hus, Luther, &amp;c.) or a few Princes and Kings, and not united among themſelves, yet made you grievous work for ſome Ages: But what ſhall we now do, if Kings themſelves unite with their Counſels and Forces, and ſet upon the work?</hi> We muſt therefore look about us quickly, and take new Counſels; yea we muſt whet the Arms of both Swords, and call Fire and Water, and Halters, and Gibbets, and Daggers, and Potions, &amp;c. to help, &amp;c. and ends (with that which is the ſum of all theſe Revelations; if he hath not leiſure to read them at large) either to repent, or to periſh. It is neceſſary, either a Total Reformation, or a Total Deſtruction, one of the two.</p>

Do as thou haſt promiſed; that the day is coming in which the Deaf ſhall hear the Word of the Book; and the eyes of the Blind ſhall ſee out of obſcurity, and out of darkneſs; In thy Light beholding light. And whoſoever thou art that readeſt theſe things, ſay with blind <hi>Bartimeus, Lord that I may ſee!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Take <hi>this Book into your hands, O Chriſtians of all parties!</hi> and <hi>know that theſe things here offered, are like to thoſe Ancient ones,</hi> the burden of <hi>Babylon,</hi> the burden of <hi>Moab,</hi> the burden of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> the burden of <hi>Egypt.</hi>—Whoever art wiſe, deſpiſe not to be forewarned, and <hi>lay aſide vain wrath againſt theſe things.</hi> If theſe threatnings came from man, they might be contemned, or the Plot counterplotted: But if from the terrible God who cannot be reſiſted, take heed!—But whether it be himſelf that ſpeaks here, he will undoubtedly know whoever reading all theſe things (together with the premiſed Informations, and the conjoyned Hiſtory thereof) attentively with the fear of God; and comparing all things with the events to which they diſpoſe themſelves, ſhall purpoſe not to ſtrive with the Fates, and the Preſident of the Fates. If any one be reſolved the contrary, namely to think <hi>Antient and new Prophecies an antiquated thing no longer to be heeded,</hi> and the World now to be governed either by Fortune, or Chance, or humane Counſels only, let him go on to ſtop his ears, ſhut his eyes, and harden his heart paſt all remedy.</p>

And laſtly, he gives a large, ſober and judicious Apology for the whole <hi>Book,</hi> and <hi>Publication:</hi>—Let them favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably hear me, All who fear God. As for me, if for fear of men I do not what God and Conſcience command, I expoſe my ſelf to his wrath, into whoſe hands it is intolerable to fall.—If new hatreds, calumnies, perſecutions attend me for this new Edition, let the will of God be done! I commit my ſelf into his hands, either to protect me, or to deliver me up into their hands who ſeek my ſoul. I am full of dayes (beyond <hi>Davids</hi> age of man) and full of the miſeries of life; ſo that it is pleaſure to ſay, It ſuffices; Lord take away my ſoul!—Away! let us not be wiſe above God! And <hi>While he commands to ſpeak, let us ſpeak, whether any one will hear us or not.</hi>—Wo unto the ſoul, if ſeeing the ſword, for fear of men he blow not the Trumpet.—I come unto thee, <hi>O Queen of Churches, the Roman, do not, I beſeech ye, ſuſpect this Trumpet of God through any private grudge towards you, to ſound as it were a charge,</hi> either to ſtir up peoples hatred towards you, or warrs againſt you—for it does not ſound to war, but a retreat.</p>
                  <p>Men Catholicks, and all that fear God, hear! <hi>Let any one of you reade this Prophetick Volumn a thouſand times, he ſhall find it hath no other ſcope than what hath in paſt Ages been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by the mouth of</hi> David <hi>and all the holy Prophets;</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that God will not alwayes endure our Babyloniſh confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and mutual <hi>Cain-like</hi> hatreds and ſlaughters; but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time totally make an end thereof, in the laſt dayes, &amp;c. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2. <hi>Mich.</hi> 4. <hi>Zech.</hi> 9. and a thouſand other places, aſwell in the antient Prophets, and Apocalyptical writings of the Apoſtles, as in theſe revealed in our ages.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I proteſt therefore before God and his Angels, and Heaven and Earth, that this Book is not publiſhed with an intent to injure any one; and that it is not to be taken for a ſcandalous Libel, but an Hiſtorical Book, and Monitory to all Chriſtians without difference:</hi> That all may deſiſt from mutual hatreds, perſecutions, ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:40863:123"/>
butcherings, &amp;c.—<hi>They are not dehortations Humane; but of God himſelf, immoveably founded in the antient Oracles, reiterated only upon new occaſions.</hi> The ſum of which is, that all things muſt be reformed among Chriſtians, or all muſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh. Mother of the Churches throughout the Weſt! Why doſt thou rage ſo againſt thy Sons, admoniſhing and exhorting thee to repentance, and amendment? When this Book was quite ready, and nothing of this Apology thought on, ſome Friends yet ſolliciting its ſuppreſſion, my Conſcience did then dictate, that it was <hi>better to obey God, rather then Men;</hi> and I cryed unto the Lord; But he taught me to take unto me this Buckler, and to lay open my heart before the eyes of Men, <hi>as it is known in the ſight of the Heart-knower.</hi>—</p>
                  <p>But I now ceaſing here to ſpeak unto you, O Chriſtian People! <hi>Invocate thee, who art God, for witneſs; that I have done, what thou haſt commanded, and nothing elſe.</hi> Nor for any other end, then that thy laſt Will might become known to them, to whom thou haſt commanded it ſhould. Nor have prefaced theſe things on any other hopes, then that men, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Creatures, might learn to diſcern and judge of things.—Perform, O God! what thou haſt promiſed; <hi>Shew, that thou haſt ſpoken theſe things, and we compelled to write.</hi> And if any one would hurt us, be thou a Wall of Fire unto us, as thou waſt to <hi>Eliah.</hi> (as <hi>Dabricius</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>(Rev.</hi> 416.) Give into the Hearts of Kings, to do what thou haſt commanded, by giving theſe things to Arbitrators, to weigh and conſider; But to ſuch as are of a ſingle heart, and have a light kindled by thy Law, and Prophets; a light burning and ſhining in truth. <hi>(Rev.</hi> 259.) Give alſo, that very Kings, and Princes, with Queens, and Prieſts, and all the People, may ſo read theſe things, as <hi>Joſias</hi> the King, with his Princes, the words of thy threatnings, to tremble at thy Judgements, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent. <hi>(Drabr.</hi> Rev. 325.) Thou thy ſelf, O Lord! work in thoſe, to whom the voice of thy Trumpet ſhall reach, that
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:40863:124"/>
thy Word may be as fire, conſuming the Abominations of Deſolation. <hi>(Rev.</hi> 559.) And whomſoever theſe voices of thine ſhall ſound about, that together thy Coeleſtial Light may ſhine about! That there may be none ſo blind with Zeal, nor a <hi>Saul</hi> ſo obſtinate in his Opinion, that may not fall down proſtrate, and cry, Lord! What wilt thou have me to do! Seeing the Abyſs of thine Anger, to have opened it's Jaws, to ſwallow up falſe Chriſtians, except they repent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>(Rev.</hi> 325.) But if even yet, they will not permit thy Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to ſpeak, but will command them to hold their peace, will ſtop their ears; it will be high time that thy ſelf, O Lord! ſpeak for thine own ſelf! Speak therefore! ſpeak, by the work it ſelf; by accompliſhment of the Predictions; that they may underſtand that it is Thou who ſpeakeſt, and doeſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Bring forth thy Witneſſes, as thou haſt promiſed, whom the World may be full of. <hi>(Rev.</hi> 569.) O Lord, hear! O Lord, forgive! O Lord, hearken, and do! Defer not, for thine own ſake, O my God!</p>
                  <p>In his Appeal, before his Epitome, ſuch paſſages as theſe occur.</p>
                  <p>O thou Adorable! dwelling in the Heavens! give teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, that <hi>Nothing is here offered unto men in thy Name, which is feigned of men, and onely covered over with thy Name:</hi> That ſo if this Light of Revelations (for ſo the Book is called) be lighted and kindled by thee in thy Church, it may be as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>extinguiſhable, as the light of the Sun and Stars in the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: But if otherwiſe, and a trap be laid for thy Chriſtian People, <hi>bring to naught the fraud, with the Zeal of thine own ſelf, O Lord God of</hi> Zebaoth! That as every Plant which the Heavenly Father has not planted, may be rooted up; ſo eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry light which the Father of Lights, has not kindled, may be put out. Yea as <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> offering ſtrange fire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, which was not commanded, but were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed with fire from the Lord: <hi>So let the like Example be now</hi>
                     <pb n="243" facs="tcp:40863:124"/>
                     <hi>ſhewn, O God! That if any have dared, and do dare to offer the figments of their own brain, in the Name of the Light of thy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations, they may fall down dead in thy Preſence, and the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of all thy People.—By thy commands, theſe things are brought to paſs.—Behold! we again ſpeak, ſeeing thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeſt and driveſt us with terrors! The words received, not from men: but from thee; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.</hi>—Never man ſpake as Chriſt; and <hi>never ſpake Satan as theſe, even as God ſpeak by his Prophets.</hi> (1.) Thundring againſt the ſins of men. (2.) Denouncing Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and whence, except they repent. (3.) Offering Grace to the Repentant. Which three ſo holy things, Satan neither will, nor can counterfeit. And for men, they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the wit of man; eſpecially of theſe men. <hi>Kotterus,</hi> an <hi>Artizan,</hi> and moſt ſimple Ideot. <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> a young Virgin, by her Age uncapable of ſuch things. <hi>Drabricius,</hi> an old doting Man; (as his Enemies traduce him;) <hi>Do they not then ſpeak things more then humane?</hi> (Therefore being neither Humane nor Diabolical, they muſt certainly be Divine.) But I ceaſe to contend with Arguments, whether theſe things be Divine, and not Humane, committing it to every mans own Conſcience and circumſpection, and the divine Illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For as none can convince by Arguments, whether it be Day or Ninght, except the Sun be riſen, to cauſe day, and men open their eyes: So none can better demonſtrate, that God ſpeaks, then God himſelf ſpeaking, and man attending to God; and that the Voice of God be ſealed alſo with Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent Effects. That the very things may ſpeak for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and their Author. (By the light only we ſee the Light, and things done by day, &amp;c.)</p>
                  <p>Wilt thou know therefore, O Man! <hi>whether God ſpeaks here? three things are to be done.</hi> (1.) To Pray, Lord! open mine eyes, that I may ſee whether it be thou that ſpeakeſt, or a Spirit of Deluſion. (2.) To hearken to the Voice of him that
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:40863:125"/>
ſpeaks. That is to know and examine all things in order, and not be ignorant of the particulars, and all circumſtances. (3.) To look about circumſpectly, whether any ſuch things be now a doing in the World or no, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>If for all this any one likes not <hi>to read this Book,</hi> let him do as he likes beſt. Let him turn away his eyes, ſtop his cars, harden his heart, &amp;c. And if he will, <hi>add furies alſo, let him rear the Book in pieces, cut it, burn it,</hi> as <hi>Joakim</hi> did, <hi>Jer.</hi> 36. Or fall on Gods Witneſſes, as on <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> or <hi>Baruch,</hi> or <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> &amp;c. But whoſoever thou art, that art wiſe, take heed of Precipices. <hi>'Tis dangerous to meddle with Prophetick Matters. 'Tis moſt ſafe counſel to abſtain from theſe men.</hi>—Specially the Perſons that undergoe and tell ſuch Dreams, Raptures, Apparitions, being otherwiſe innocent and harmleſs. Rather ſay as the <hi>Phariſees</hi> of <hi>Paul, We have found no evil in this man: But if a Spirit have ſpoken unto him, or an Angel, let us not fight againſt God.</hi> He wages War with God, who by force ſeeks to oppreſs the Spirit of Propheſie. But if by no obte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations we can obtain moderation with men, I humbly throw my ſelf proſtrate with this whole Cauſe at thy feet, Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus! who art conſtituted Judge of quick and dead; diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh betwixt, and pronounce with thy true Mouth, for the Truth, againſt a lie!—</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But there are ſo many frauds and cheats in the World, will ſome ſay; But however the Apoſtle bids,</hi> Deſpiſe not Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie. Try the Spirits whether they be of God or no. Try all things, hold faſt that which is Good.—</p>
                  <p>We will but add laſtly, (having gone ſo far already, beyond our intent at the firſt, in theſe Apologetick Diſcourſes and Collections) the moſt weighty paſſages, out of their ſolemn Prayer, and appeal to Chriſt, in that publick form, made for the tryal of <hi>Drabicius,</hi> by the <hi>forecited dreadful Oath;</hi> All for the further evidence and confirmation of the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, with the candid and ingenuous Reader; and to give the
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:40863:125"/>
greater authority, if it may be, to ſuch a prophetick Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, before we paſs to the Propheſies themſelves.</p>
                  <p>—We know the impudence of that Enemy, who is ſo bold as to mix himſelf with thy Sons, and to counterfeit an Angel of Light, when he is but the Prince of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and to offer himſelf to be a Leader and Counſellor to men, when he is the worſt and vileſt Betrayer, and ſo to colour over his Prophets and Apoſtles, as to appear thy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apoſtles. Yea, and to boaſt and ſet off himſelf for thee; Antichriſt for Chriſt. But we, alas! are too ſlow and heartleſs to apprehend his ſo many Impoſtures, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs thou comeſt in to relieve, O Helper! He will confound, ſubvert, overturn all things. But where ſhall remain thy <hi>Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gium,</hi> O Son of God! that thou appearedſt to deſtroy the works of the Devil. <hi>Appear therefore! O appear unto us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo! in the preſent deciſion and danger we now ſuffer from Satan!</hi> ſowing among us Tares of ſcandalous Doctrine and Life, <hi>and of falſe prophets, or elſe falſe zeal againſt them.</hi> Ah! ſuffer us not to be befooled, this, or that, or the other way, for thy Holy Names ſake! Let the Father of Lies execute and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the work of Seduction, and lying wonders in them that periſh; who have not believed the Truth. We thy humble Flock, who have choſen to adhere to thy Word, <hi>Let thy holy Spirit preſerve us from the ſeduction of Errors!</hi>—Or if it pleaſe thee to try us; yet let it not be as to our ſouls.—Whether as to Goods, Health, or Life it ſelf, (as to <hi>Job, Paul,</hi> and the Sons and Daughters of <hi>Job,)</hi>—thy Will be done. But deliver not our Souls to his power, we beſeech thee! to wit, an Underſtanding and Will, <hi>to befool, puzzle, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert us. That we may neither receive the works of Satan for Gods; as</hi> Ahab; <hi>or abominate the Work of God for Satans;</hi> as the Phariſees, who deluded by Satan, execrated Chriſt as Satan; by it thereby blaſpheming God himſelf.—</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Behold! behold! he goes on to ſow the Tares of ſo many ſcandals amongſt us alſo, who ſuffer for thy Name!</hi> Alſo
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:40863:126"/>
falſe Propheſies, as we fear, or falſe Lights, to diſcern whether truly Divine, and from thee.—<hi>But thou, O Lord! with whom is light, and who alone ſeeſt all things, and alone knoweſt to diſtinguiſh Error from Truth; Why hold hold'ſt thou thy peace at theſe things? Why hold'ſt thou thy peace ſo long, ſo many years?</hi> Is now thy Zeal or Fire wanting to thy Clouds, to conſume thoſe that bring ſtrange fire into thy Preſence; or to ſhew who is thy true Prophet, or not; in the ſight of all thy People. Is there wanting a Sword to reſtrain <hi>Paſchur,</hi> the Smiter of thy <hi>Jeremiah's;</hi> or a blow to ſtrike <hi>Hananias</hi> the falſe Prophet dead. <hi>(This year thou ſhalt die, and he did ſo,</hi> Jer. <hi>28. 16, 17.)</hi> Or captivity to lead away <hi>Amazias,</hi> the Informer againſt thy <hi>Amos.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O Lord, the Dominator! If any Crafts-maſter and Contriver of Cheats, have befooled any one amongſt us, ſo as to reckon his ſad trifling Songs, or mournful Ditties, for true Revelations Divine, and to vent them to others, deceiving, and being decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; Succour him! ſuccour the reſt of us! <hi>that we may be as thy Mouth, ſeparating the precious from the vile. But now,</hi> if any one of us, willingly and knowingly, give up himſelf, as an Inſtrument to Satan, and in thy Name, exerciſes impoſtures; Lord! make it manifeſt; and ſet forth ſuch a Meſſenger of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan for an Example to the World. <hi>Thou ſparedſt not the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels that proudly ſinned; neither ſpare theſe who imitating Satanical pride, draw away themſelves, and others, into Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipices of deſtruction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the other ſide, forſake not thy holy <hi>Jeremiahs,</hi> or <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chea's,</hi> that are bruiſed with a petulant Tongue or Hand; or thruſt into Priſon: But all <hi>Paſchurs,</hi> their Smiters, fill with fear on every ſide, every where, that their eyes may ſee the truth of thy Words.—</p>
                  <p>And indeed accordingly, God begins to ſpeak for himſelf, (ſo that there is no need for man to ſpeak for him more.) <hi>But where, and how?</hi> Firſt, in the very <hi>Act of</hi> Drabricius<hi>'s Oath.</hi>
                     <pb n="147" facs="tcp:40863:126"/>
For there was this <hi>Dilemma. If I have not ſpoken thy Words, O God! ſmite me in pieoes in the ſight of all.</hi> If thine; ſhew, that they are thine, by fulfilling their truth. But behold! he doth not yet ſinite him; (but ſuffer him to live very old) and on the contrary hath ſmote ſeveral of his Adverſaries with death, according to the threatnings of God by him; and particularly one of the Paſtors, a new one, among thoſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iles, who became a new Adverſary to him. Therefore he gives teſtimony, that they are not others words. Secondly, In the Events themſelves, much fulfilled, or daily fulfilling, &amp;c. Therefore what need of more words? &amp;c. But to leave all to God, who alwayes accompliſhes his words, firſt, or laſt, in his own time, and his own way.</p>
                  <p>And thus we have at length brought a long-boding pream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to an end; which hath exceeded indeed the bounds due to this place: But being in, we knew not how to give of, nor forbear ſuch material paſſages, for the gaining greater cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to the enſuing Relations; and which was almoſt abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary, to prevent prejudice and offence againſt things of ſo ſtrange a nature; That ſo the Courteous Reader might the better take in good part the Hiſtory, what ever heed he give to the Propheſie.</p>
                  <p>For we divine full well, that moſt will but look upon them, as the Dreams or Ravings of two old doting Seniors, now going down with their gray Hairs in ſorrow to the grave. But be they of God, Man, or the Devil, they are the ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt things that ever yet appeared on the Stage of the World. And for that end only we relate them here, as obſervable Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, and matter of Fact; and thereby, if they prove true, the future State of <hi>Europe.</hi> And have further thought fit to repreſent the chief and moſt material Things, that <hi>Comenius</hi> has recorded in behalf of their Truth and Verity, or wrote by way of Apology for them. Which having done, we leave it to Time and Providence, to diſcover and prove them,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:40863:127"/>
either Verities or Deluſions; But however, whether one or the other, moſt Remarkable. And yet one would think mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of years ſhould teach wiſdom, and make the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced paſt all ſuch dotages. <hi>Comenius</hi> is aged, learned, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and godly, known of all men; <hi>hath had above forty years knowledge and tryal of theſe matters,</hi> as has been ſaid before; And has obſerved and delivered <hi>more convincing Arguments for their Divinity, than any has, or can, againſt them.</hi> Has had the Teſtimony of the moſt illuminated Divines of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom. Has found none to convince or condemn them of Impoſture, upon <hi>fair tryal and examination; which moſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable requeſt, is all that is deſired in the face of all the Chriſtian World, and ought not in juſtice be denyed them;</hi> Till which let all men be ſilent before God. For 'tis better to ſuſpend Judgment, than paſs it raſhly. None of theſe things have been done clandeſtinely, or managed inconſiderately. <hi>They ſtand ready for the Bar of Mans Tribunal; and in the mean while appeal to God.</hi> If they muſt needs be reproached for theſe things, ſayes <hi>Comenius,</hi> and that Chriſtian People will ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God and their own Souls; for their parts, they will like <hi>Jeremy, appeal to God and Men.</hi> Firſt, And above all things, <hi>to God, the Supream Witneſs, Judge and Avenger of this Cauſe; and then to thoſe who are in the place of God on Earth;</hi> both Governors of States, and Churches too, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to plead this Cauſe before them.—</p>
                  <p>Now if they be of Man, or the Devil, none ought to fear them, but contemn them. And therefore none ſhould be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended that they are thus brought to light, and into Engliſh. For we intend them here, only as a moſt wonderful Hiſtory of the preſent Age, not to be paſſed over without taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of. For, be they true, be they falſe, they will be found exceeding uſeful to the Age, and to Poſterity.</p>

                  <p>Now for theſe Propheſies, we ſhall firſt give you the ſcope and ſum of them beforehand in general, and then come to the Revelations and Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons themſelves, in particular.</p>
                  <p>The utmoſt ſcope of all theſe Revelations is, according to the manner of the Ancient Prophets. (1.) To ſhew unto Chriſtians the manifold ſins and aberrations wherewith they have provoked, and do provoke God; and ſad Lamentations thereupon. (2.) To diſcover the Cauſes of the preſent Plagues and Judgments, wherewith God breaks in pieces the World; and the Cauſes why Gods Wrath waxes hot ſo againſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom; and to excite and forewarn men to attend ſeriouſly to the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble threatnings of Wrath, and comfortable promiſes of Grace. (3.) To ſhew the way of eſcaping the Wrath, and preventing the laſt deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and of obtaining the Grace. (1.) By general and univerſal Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, Repentance, Reformation and Amendment. (2.) By univerſal mutual Love, Charity, and peaceableneſs one with another, of all Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Sects, and Religions; That all Names of diſtinction be laid aſide, and factious contendings about Opinions ceaſe; and that one common Faith and Love prevail among Chriſtians of all ſorts, to preſerve the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace. And that all wicked unchriſtian-Chriſtian Wars and Fightings, and ſuch cruel devourings of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, not becoming that Name, whether for Religion, or worldly Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, be laid aſide. And (3.) by offering and communicating the ſame common Mercy and Benefit, that is, the Light and Bleſſing of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:40863:129"/>
and thereby Univerſal Peace, Truth, Righteouſneſs, and Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Nations of the Earth. <hi>For that now God would have all the World reformed,</hi> and bleſſed with all true Felicities, and Univerſal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, both Temporal and Eternal. In a word the Kingdom of God come, and the State of the Divine and Holy Life, tryumph, and be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted over the Animal, Senſual, Beaſtial, and Deviliſh. (4.) And laſtly, That otherwiſe Chriſtendom ſhall feel the Power of Gods An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and of his wonderful Judgments; and the Vials of his Wrath be poured out, &amp;c. For that Chriſtians ought firſt to reform, and begin this Univerſal Reſtitution. Elſe that God will find others, but deſtroy them, by one another; or by letting in the Barbarous Nations, the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars,</hi> &amp;c. in upon them. That the time of deſtroying and overturning is at hand. This and ſuch like is their general ſcope.</p>
                  <p>And more particularly to ſtir up Princes, Prieſts, and People, all to their particular Duties. Kings, to execute the call of their high Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. To do the Will and Work of God on Earth. <hi>i. e.</hi> To reform both Church and State; and <hi>to take unto them their Scepters, and Authority, committed to them of God, out of the hands of the Antichriſtian uſurper, &amp;c. To call a General Council,</hi> in order to a Univerſal Peace, and Una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity in Chriſtendom; and to agree for God and Religion; for the publick good both of Church and State; For that God will put it into their hearts to fulfil his Will, and agree, (or make one Mind and Will) and no longer give their Kingdoms to the Beaſt; But that the Words of God ſhall be fulfilled; To deſtroy <hi>Babylon,</hi> and all her Abominations and Idols, &amp;c. and to rule the World peacefully, under the Banner of Chriſt; and univerſally reform it out of all its horrible confuſions and diſorders, according to the Will, that is, the Word of God, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And all Eccleſiaſticks, Angels of the Churches, Paſtors, Biſhops, and Prieſts, to perform the Miniſtry of their high Calling, and the Service of God, and the Church; <hi>to reſtore the Primitive Reformation,</hi> and do their firſt Works, and repent, and no longer neglect the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> of God, through the whole World, for worldly Dominion, Honours, Riches, and Intereſts: Nor to hinder Univerſal Reformation, by wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and conteſting for Opinions, Ceremonies, Revenues, Prerogatives, and Priviledges, and ſuch like vanities; but rather to promote Catholick Charity and Indulgence, and practiſe Chriſtian Humility, Self-Deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and all the excellent virtues of the beſt Religion in the World, which they are Chieftains of; and to Sacrifice all their deareſt concerns for the Salvation of Men; And not mind their own things, but the things of Jeſus Chriſt, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="253" facs="tcp:40863:129"/>
And all Chriſtians to endeavour and begin Reformation generally in their ſeveral places. For that now is the time of Gods reforming the World more then ever; That towards the end thereof, it may be as from the beginning, <hi>viz.</hi> one God, and one Worſhip of God, in Spirit and in Truth, without Idols and falſe Godds, and falſe Worſhips; That all may inhabit peaceably the Earth, without Wars, Fightings, Hatreds, Contentions, Envyings, Strifes, and without Sects and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; leſt his Wrath break forth upon them to the utmoſt, and there be no Remedy for the Preſent Generation. All which things to be ſure, are no other then was the driſt of all the Prophets, and extraordinary Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers of God to Men, of old; when that all ordinary Perſons, Kings, Princes, Prieſts, or People, were become ſo corrupt and exorbitant, that there were none that did his duty rightly: but all deſperately tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Law of their God, and provoked his Wrath without meaſure. For what elſe was their Burthens, but ſad Lamentations for the Peoples ſins and wickedneſs; Exhortations to Repentance and amendment; And denunciations of Grace upon Repentance, and of Wrath upon Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitence? &amp;c. And what elſe are theſe likewiſe, as to their main Scope and Intent?</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>The Sum and Subſtance of them in General, now follows.</label> The Sum of all theſe Propheſies in the General, is the ſame with all the Antient Prophets, and indeed an Explication of them; concerning the State of the Church in the laſt dayes; And that our preſent Age, is the laſt time of the World, wherein ſhall be fully and finally accompliſhed all Scripture Propheſies.

All which things, with many others in particular, were communicated to him by God, under innumerable ſtrange and wonderful Viſions and Revelations, continued for ſo many years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, even to this very day.</p>
                  <p>Whoſe Books, <hi>ſayes one,</hi> will exerciſe the Wits both of Learned and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned, ſo long, 'till God ſhews what lies under by the Events themſelves.

                  <p>And yet before we conclude, we have ſtole a few Sheets more out from among the Propheſies, &amp;c.

And therefore, ſeeing we could not produce the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies; It was pertinent, and requiſice to ſubjoyn Theſe to the foregoing Matters, before we quite break off and conclude.</p>

                     <head>The firſt Relation of <hi>Kotter</hi> before the Senate, of Angelical Revelations, had by him for three years before, in the year, <hi>1616.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>ON the 29<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1619. <hi>Chriſtopher Kotter</hi> appeared before the Senate of the City <hi>Sprottavia,</hi> who were the Magiſtrates there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and having crav'd and obtain'd liberty to ſpeak, thus began. That he acknowledged that he ſtood before them, to whom he was bound, <hi>by the Holy Law of an Oath,</hi> to ſpeak nothing but Truth. And that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the preſent peculiar cauſe, for which he appeared, he would in good faith relate nothing elſe, but what in very deed and in truth hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to him, and is wont ſtill to happen. He therefore declared, that on <hi>June</hi> 11. 1616. it hapned, that going to <hi>Gorlitz,</hi> he lodged at <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hammer;</hi> whence the next morning being gone on his way, and paſt <hi>Gorlitz Wood,</hi> and entred into an open plain, intending for <hi>Langenovia,</hi> his birth-place, There approached a certain man on one ſide of him, of a moſt comely feature, in Mourning Apparel, and black Boots; whom he ſuſpected to be ſome <hi>Mine-man,</hi> becauſe the Neighbourhood abounded with Iron Mines; but he drew nearer, and lovingly ſaluted <hi>Chriſtopher;</hi> inquiring, Whither he was going? And that returning his ſalutations, he anſwered to his inquiries; And that while, by this means, they came at length to familiar Speeches, and had proceeded almoſt four Miles in company together on their way, diſcourſing with one another, it fell out that entring into ſome narrow paſſages of the Road, this Companion addreſſing himſelf more roughly to <hi>Chriſtopher</hi> then he had uſed, cries out, <hi>Ho! Thou man! I have ſomething to tell thee which thou muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to the Magiſtrates Eccleſiaſticks and Saecular. Chriſtopher</hi> amazed at theſe things, and not knowing what ſhould be the matter, the other went on, <hi>That the Wrath of God is kindled againſt Man-kind, and it ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtens to inflict puniſhments in fury, except they repent. To puniſh eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally that pride, impurity, and contempt of God, and of the Divine Word.</hi> When he had ſaid theſe things, they were come to the Medow of <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chior Frank;</hi> where, becauſe a Ditch was to be paſſed, <hi>Chriſtopher</hi> going over the little Bridg firſt, the other behind his back, vaniſhed he knew not whither, and ſo went on alone to <hi>Langenovia;</hi> but from thence,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:40863:134"/>
after he had tarried a night with his Mother, to <hi>Gorlitz,</hi> to his <hi>quondam</hi> Maſter in his Craft. And on the 14<hi>th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> entring the Temple, heard a Sermon: and that when his thoughts diſturbed ſo, from this late conſternation, could not be quiet; for his mind ſake, he went even to the Chappel, which they call <hi>Chriſts Sepulchre.</hi> That there, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon beheld lately, again appeared unto him, and repeating the ſame words, diſappeared. That the next day following, after Prayers in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and Sermon heard, returning into the Suburbs, the ſelf ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon returned, accompanying him, and reiterating what he had before ſaid, vaniſhed. That after this, going to <hi>Langenovia,</hi> he remained a whole week with his Mother, lame of his feet, and moleſted with many diſquietments of mind. But that when after he was returning back again to his buſineſs, to the City, that perſon met him in his Fathers Field, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calling thoſe former things to his memory. That thence betaking him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf homewards, and lodging at <hi>Sagan,</hi> as he went to Church in the morning, the ſame Man met him again in the ſtreet, in the ſame feature, yet not in mourning habit now, but of a Jacynth colour. That he therefore, after Sermon, <hi>went to the chief Paſtor of the Church,</hi> M. Meiſner, <hi>and related the Matter,</hi> as it had hapned, and deſired advice. Who gave him this, That continuing fervent prayers to God, he would, for a little while longer, ſuppreſs this thing in ſilence, and as much as he could, ſhake thoſe things out of his mind; mindful of that, <hi>They have</hi> Moſes <hi>and the Prophets, let them hear them.</hi> Yet adding, that he would not be wanting to his duty to exhort men to Repentance; and that, that Viſion, if it came from God, as Author, would return again. That <hi>Chriſtopher</hi> therefore, obtaining this anſwer, went away, and going his way home, makes his Kinſman, (whom he had turn'd a little out of the way in his Journey to ſee) and (when at home) his Wife alſo, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious to the whole matter. Being yet admoniſhed on all hands, to hold his peace, leſt the fame thereof being carried to the Magiſtrates or the Miniſters, he might run ſome danger. And from that time, that he never made any one acquainted with it; yet perpetually diſquieted in his own Conſcience; till on the 14<hi>th</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> 1619. The ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon cloathed in Jacynth habit, appeared unto him again. At which ſight, he was now, not only not afrighted, but filled through and through with a certain intimate and unwonted joy. But <hi>being asked</hi> (after firſt ſaluting of him) <hi>whether he had taken care of the things he had commanded him;</hi> and when, not knowing what to anſwer, he ſtood mute, That that man, with eyes lifted up to Heaven, ſaid, <hi>Not unto us, not unto us, O Lord! but unto thy Name give Glory!</hi> And turning
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:40863:135"/>
to <hi>Chriſtopher,</hi> ſaid on, <hi>But why did you neglect to perform that?</hi> Or has not thy God deſerved a greater thing than this at thy hands? Who hath Created, Redeemed, Sanctified, and Regenerated thee to the hope of eternal Life? Behold! thy God hath delivered up his Son to death for thy ſake! and doſt thou refuſe to lend him thy Tongue? and to yeeld thy ſelf an Inſtrument of his Work? <hi>I declare plainly unto thee, except thou ſhalt do this thing, that thou ſhalt not have quiet in thine heart. Nor this only, but thy Name alſo ſhall be blotted out of the Book of Life.</hi> Why doſt thou fear men that are lighter then the Leaves of the Trees, making a noiſe? Who indeed ſhall paſs this three-fold Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Cenſure upon theſe things? <hi>Some ſhall threaten thee, others ſhall wonder, moſt ſhall ſlight.</hi> But thou, take heed thou regard none of theſe things! Then the Spirit began to inform him, That the face of the preſent times, was partly joyful, partly ſorrowful. Joyful, for that they were times of Grace, in which the Light of the Divine Word hath ſhined in ſuch clear brightneſs unto men; ſorrowful, for that men would not ſee this Light, but keept their hearts darkned with Errors and infidelity. That theſe things were more at large explained by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, but that all things were not retained in his memory. At length that the Spirit ſaid, Unleſs men ſhall go about ſeriouſly, and in good earneſt to amend themſelves, <hi>That God was about to puniſh them grievouſly with Sword, Famine, and Peſtilence.</hi> And reaching forth his right hand to <hi>Chriſtopher,</hi> warned him further, to put off all fear. That no hurt ſhould beſal him; and laſtly added thereto, <hi>I will haſten my Word to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh it.</hi> And that theſe things ſaid, he diſappeared. But that he was left there alone, amazed at firſt, then caſting his eyes round about, on all parts, he ſaw, on one ſide, a white company of them that ſung and tryumphed; but on the other, a black company of them that wailed and howled; and that being aſtoniſhed with the Viſion, he returned home.</p>

                        <p>December <hi>the firſt, Being delivered by the Magiſtrates to the Paſtors of</hi> Sprottavia, <hi>he ſuffered a ſevere examination,</hi> That as he would be ſafe of his Salvation, he would plainly declare whence he had theſe things; or whether or no he did not feign them; or being feign'd by ſome one elſe, he did not ſpread them in the name of Viſions. <hi>They inculcated to him,</hi> That he would conſider well, how great things they were he undertook; what an horrible crime he would incur, if there were deceit under-hand; To how great danger he expoſed his Conſcience; how he would ſtir up the Wrath of God and men againſt him, and involve Wife, Children, and many others with himſelf, into great miſchief. <hi>He having heard all things with a chearful mind, and nothing afraid, Anſwered,</hi> That he took upon him all the Curſes; And wiſht all thoſe things might happen, if he ever ſpake any thing beſides thoſe which he ſaw, and heard, and received in command; That no ſuch things ever hapned to him, ſo much as in a dream; much leſs was feigned by himſelf, a man ignorant of all things; Nor that any of thoſe things were received, or heard from any man; But that all thoſe things were ſo repreſented to him by Viſions. But whether the Spirit was a good or evil one, he could not diſcern; and therefore asked counſel and information, whether any thing here was contrary to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Word of God, or no?

countenance, nor the ſame ſound of voice as the former Spirit had; and wearing a three coloured habit, White, Skie and Flame-colour. This Spirit he conjured by the living God who he was. And on bended knees, adored Jeſus the Son of God; That ſeeing he was that Saviour, who hath bruiſed the head of the Serpent, and came into the World to deſtroy the works of the Devil, that through his Mercy and Merit, he would vouchſafe him this Grace, That if this Viſion was any Spectre or Ghoſt, or any Inchantment of Satan, that he might be delivered from it. That he would grant him to know it, and would make his Conſcience quiet. Having poured out this Prayer unto Chriſt, on a ſudden he felt in his heart ſo great ſolace and joy, that he could not expreſs in words. But the Youth, calling him by name, ſpake to him in theſe words, <hi>I do not draw thee away from God, but draw thee unto God, as hath been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſignified unto thee.</hi> And in the firſt place, I ſhew unto thee Chriſt and his Merit, in which alone only conſiſts Salvation.

                           <hi>March</hi> 20. He went a Journey accompanied with a Friend<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but his Angel appearing unto him, led him out of his way into the Field, and asked him, <hi>If he had done his Errand to the King?</hi> Who ſaid, <hi>He had: but few gave heed; That he did expoſe himſelf to laughter.</hi> The Angel comforts him, That he would not regard, though none at all believed: And as the Prophet <hi>Eliſha</hi> anſwered the unbelieving Captain of <hi>Samaria,</hi> Thou ſhalt ſee, but ſhalt not injoy: So it ſhall be with them that will not believe. They ſhall ſee, but receive no benefit, &amp;c. And after ſeveral Viſions and Diſcourſes, the Angel alſo informed him what he ſhould anſwer Mockers; If any one ſay unto thee, How dareſt thou ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuch things too high for thee, nor ever likely to come to paſs? An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer thou, Our Converſation is in Heaven, from whence we expect our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt. They will ſay, How thou a mortal man art not afraid to ſpeak of Heavenly Things? Say thou, I am indeed mortal, but I believe Chriſt will reform this mortal body, and faſhion it like his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Body. They will urge, That thy Predictions are againſt reaſon. Thou ſhalt anſwer, That God hath made all things ſubject to himſelf; nor is his hand ſhortned, that he cannot ſave; nor is any thing at length impoſſible to him. Then the Angel inlarged this Diſcourſe with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Paſſion Sermon, &amp;c.—</p>
                        <p>Innumerable Inſtances of this kind might be collected out of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies,

                        <p>In one of his Propheſies, the <hi>Burning of a great City</hi> is given, as a Character of the time for fulfilling of theſe things. The words run thus.</p>
                        <p>—But what the great Lion ſaid, he was forbidden to reveal.

                        <p>The Speech or Sermon of the great Lion was uttered twice; firſt in a Lions; ſecondly in a Humane ſhape, in the year 1623. And which he was commanded to ſeal up; 'till when he was delivered out of Priſon, in the year 1628. and then he had liberty to declare it, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>IN the year 1627. <hi>December</hi> 30. when being afflicted with an heavy diſeaſe, I wiſhed for death; it was ſaid unto me from the Lord, That yet was not the time, but that I ſhould remain in this Mortality, till the Term come, which he himſelf had put. But when I beſought that that Term alſo might be ſhewn unto me, to prepare my ſelf ſo much the more vigilently for death. He anſwered, <hi>There ſhall be yet a year ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to thy life, in which I will uſe thee for my works.</hi> He added, <hi>But doſt thou not deſire to ſupervive, when Jehovah ſhall put on ſtrength, and his glorious Majeſty? And when he ſhall deſtroy his Enemies? And when the mighty ſhall be ſcattered by him; and ſo thoſe things come to paſs which have been foretold thee.</hi> I anſwered thereunto, <hi>Lord! thou knoweſt that thy Eternal Delights are ſweeter to me, then all thoſe things which thou revealeſt unto me.</hi> But he rebuked my impatience, dehorting me from wearineſs; ſo he went away from me. Now all the following year, 1628, He made no mention of my life or death, except in the laſt Viſion. Moreover, that I was to undergoe alſo one diſeaſe. Then in 1629. <hi>January</hi> the 9<hi>th,</hi> It was declared unto me by an Angel, that I ſhould be viſited from the Lord in a Dream with a Diſeaſe, by name, <hi>the Apoplexy; which alſo came the ſame day in the evening.</hi> I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, becauſe the year was now gone, the Viſions had now ceaſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that the very time was now approaching, which the Lord had ſpoke concerning. And that I ſhould not now eſcape this Diſeaſe, I therefore prepared my ſelf in mind and conſcience, and my deſire was to
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:40863:137"/>
be diſſolved, and to be with Chriſt. Which hope, certain antecedent ſigns alſo did ſtrengthen. As were certain knockings, or beatings un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my Bed (and under the next Table) four ſeveral evenings; (many that viſited me being preſent, and hearing) ſo iterated, that each day the number was leſs by one ſtroak. At length, on the 26<hi>th</hi> of <hi>January,</hi> it ſounded one; and afterwards five; which having heard, I believed, as alſo the reſt, That one only day of my life was now remaining; and an end to be to morrow evening, at five a clock. Therefore watching all that night, and praying and meditating on eternal life, and this bleſſed departure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I decreed to paſs hence. But hearing by night a certain voice, as it were of a man, three times, <hi>Come, come, come!</hi> Unuſual Joy being ſhed abroad through my Soul, I ſlept a little. But Saturday morning, at break of day, when more vehement pains oppreſſed me, I could not but interpret that Voice to have been a Divine Call. I bad farewel therefore to my beloved Friends, viſiting me all that day. And<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I was alwayes worſe and worſe; till evening approaching, my Sight, Hearing, Memory, Speech, and at length my Spirit failed me. <hi>And I felt my ſelf to go forth with my Spirit, and to be carried into Heaven; where ſurrounded with a great ſhining, I ſaw an huge company cloathed in White. And the Lord ſtepping forth, took me in his imbrace;</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, The Lord hath done whatſoever he would in Heaven and in Earth! For the Majeſty of his Power is exalted, and there is no counſel of his Will, nor does it admit any. For who hath known the mind of the Lord, and who hath been his Counſellor? <hi>Return therefore unto the place from whence thou art come forth; and the breath of the moſt High ſhall vivify thee. Ariſe, walk<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> farewel to thy Diſeaſe; and behold the goodneſs of Jehovah in the Land of the Living, exulting in his virtue. For the dead ſhall not praiſe Jehovah, nor admire his Works, when they go down into the place of Silence; but the living, the living ſhall bleſs thee from this time, and for ever.</hi> God Jehovah dwells on high, and hath exalted his Right Hand over all Nations! And does wonderful things, as it pleaſes him, at all times. He is the God of the living, who alſo draws forth out of death, and who gives life even for ever. Therefore ſadded with theſe things, I begged, that he would ſignifie unto me, <hi>How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the dayes of my life ſhould be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> But he ſaid, <hi>Thy times are in the hand of the Lord. He has meaſured thy years, and hid thy term from thee. Live therefore, and injoy the goodneſs of God upon the Earth amongst his Saints. But ſanctifie thy years to God thy Creator, and live righteouſly.</hi> But thy reward and thy portion ſhall not wither away, nor periſh; but thou ſhalt find it, and ſhalt rejoyce concerning it, and in it, unto eternity.
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:40863:138"/>
That alſo which the moſt High does with thee, accept gratefully, and go not contrary to thy Creator, by thy impatience. <hi>Go thy wayes now, and return, for it is Jehovah who doth good to thee, and hath a care of thee.</hi> Therefore offer unto him the ſacrifice of praiſe, and render thy Vows to the moſt High; giving thanks alſo unto him, that he works the Work of Salvation in thee, and will ſtill work, even until he ſhall bleſſedly fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh it, unto the praiſe of his Grace, but unto thy Honour. <hi>I wiſh uſe thee no more unto my works, neither will I come unto thee.</hi> Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore glorifie God in thy Body and Spirit, which he hath given thee.

After he had ſaid theſe things, <hi>I falling down, worſhipped him; And together alſo returned into life. Sad indeed, yet reſtored that very moment, to full vigor, and health, and ſtrength.

                                 <p>I <hi>Nicholas Drabricius</hi> a <hi>Straſnian,</hi> Exile of Chriſt, by this my Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting confeſs, That certain Obſervations of <hi>Paul Veterine,</hi> Inhabitant of <hi>Puchow,</hi> directly tending to the abuſe of the Divine Name, and the Voice through me made to the Nations of the Earth, Eaſtern, and We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern, and Northern, and Southern, have come to my hands: By which, I ſtirr'd up unto zeal, purpoſed to ſnatch up the <hi>Sacred Book,</hi> and <hi>on what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever place I ſhould light, to take that for a foundation of my Anſwer:</hi> I open'd therefore, and beyond hope preſently are offer'd to my Eyes thoſe laſt words of <hi>David,</hi> (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 2.) <hi>The Spirit of the Lord hath ſpoken by me, and his Word by my Tongue:</hi> Which admiring, I opened again, and fell upon thoſe words of <hi>Samuel,</hi> (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 2, &amp;c.) <hi>If ye do return un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord with all your hearts, then put away the ſtrange Gods, Baalim and Aſtaroth, from among you;</hi> (but in the Papacy, Idols and Images of He and She Saints) <hi>and prepare<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>your hearts unto the Lord, to ſerve him only,</hi> &amp;c. And I will pray for you unto the Lord; and he pray'd, and the Lord heard him; and the Lord thundred with agreat Thunder upon the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines,</hi> and diſcomfited them, and they were ſmitten before the Children of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> And <hi>Samuel</hi> builtan Altar unto the Lord, &amp;c.</p>
                                 <p>When furthermore I turned over three leaves, there came in ſight the 14 <hi>verſ.</hi> of <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. of the ſame Book, <hi>If ye will fear the Lord, and ſerve</hi>
                                    <pb n="276" facs="tcp:40863:141"/>

Fear not, but ſerve the Lord with all your heart; follow not after vain things, Idols which will not profit you, becauſe they are vain.</p>
                                 <p>At length I opened anew, and found <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. of the Book of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> where it is ſaid, That Wiſdom enters not into a malitious Soul: And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Spirit of Wiſdom be a kind and loving Spirit, yet it acquits not a Blaſphemer of his Lips, becauſe God is Witneſs of his Reins, and a true Searcher of his Heart, and Hearer of his Tongue. Therefore he that ſpeaketh unrighteous things cannot be hid, nor eſcape Judgement, for the correction of his Iniquities; and the Mouth that belieth, ſlayeth the Soul.</p>
                                 <p>It ſlayeth indeed: I, which in my time alſo mine Eyes have ſeen how many, by the blaſphemous ſpeech of their mouth, and by the Writings of their hands, have procured deſtruction to themſelves; being made a Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle to Angels and Pious Men, in whom is no guile; Such, (as by the goodneſs of God) there are many every where, Men great, and illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, Divines and Stateſmen, through <hi>Hungary, Holland,</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> found: Who, how ſincerely and reverently they receive the Words of God by me pronounced, have teſtified it by their Writings; after that God had given it into their hearts to ſee, and know, and underſtand the hand of God to have done this, <hi>and the Holy One of Iſrael to have ſpoken by me (Iſa.</hi> 41. 20.) now in the laſt days of the World: A'ſo concerning <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> (Ezek. 39. Rev. 20.) That they are about to be rooted out, with all Errors of depraved Doctrine.</p>
                                 <p>Wherefore I <hi>Nicholas Drabricius</hi> forewarn all who have read the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned VVritings of <hi>Paul Veterine,</hi> and beſeech them by the Bowe's of the Mercy of God, That they take heed to themſelves thereof; as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing guileful, falſe, drawing their Riſe from Satan the Father of Lyes; of which Father of Lyes, Chriſt ſaith, That he came and took the words of God out of the hearts of men, leſt they ſhould believe and be ſaved, <hi>(Luke</hi> 8. 12.)</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <hi>But let all know that the Lord is my God, who vouchſafeth to ſpeak to me unworthy; and that I, and my Adjunct, who in my ſtead declares the Words of God in the Latin Tongue, to the Nations of the Earth; and laſtly, the Promoters of the Work,</hi> added unto us from Heaven, ſeek no other things, (God lives, and our Soul lives in God) than the Honour and Glory of God firſt: The Honour, I ſay, of the Omniſcience and Veracity of God; who, as he hath promiſed, the Beaſt being caſt down, and the Babyloniſh VVhore burnt, and Satan bound, to renew to himſelf his Church on the

face of the whole Earth; <hi>So he is about to do it now in our days:</hi> That all the Kingdoms of the VVorld may become our Lords, and his Chriſts, <hi>(Rev.</hi> 11. 15. and Chap. 17, 18, 19, 20.)</p>
                                 <p>Next we ſought alſo (by the Command and Charge of the Lord our God) our Neighbours good, both of Chriſtians eſpecially before others, and alſo of the yet Infidels, Turks, and whatſoever Pagans, that they may be converted from Idols, and other Abominations, to the Living God, and his holy and pure Worſhip: Of which things, what the Wiſdom of God, in the year 1653. <hi>Nov.</hi> 8. ſpake to me, may be read in theſe Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations. For all theſe are deſtitute of the true and ſaving Faith of God, given to the Patriarchs, Prophets, Apoſtles, and other Saints; Inſtead of the Law of God, the Turks having their Alcoran, the Jews their Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mud; but many Chriſtians, the Pope, and other Leaders of Errors.</p>
                                 <p>Thirdly, We ſought alſo with a dutiful, faithful, and ſimple, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere mind, to execute the Commands of God, without all reſpect to men, by teſtifying to all, (whether it pleaſe all, or diſpleaſe ſome; and whether they will hear or forbear, believe or not believe) That God never will'd, nor yet wills the Death of a Sinner; but that all converted from Impiety, Errors and Iniquities, do Judgement and Juſtice; <hi>Giving to Caeſar the things that are Caeſars, and to God the things that are Gods.</hi>
                                 </p>

                                    <hi>Therefore the Wiſdom of God</hi> Commanded me to ſpeak unto the Houſe of Auſtria, (with her Supporters, the Spaniard and Pope; Him, as a broken Reed; This, as a Fire-brand burnt; and to others) That the Lord of Heaven and Earth was about to do unto the Houſe of Auſtria, as he did unto the Houſe of Ahab; and to his Counſellors and Prophets, as Elias did unto the Baalites; whom in the ſight of all the People he ſlew with the Sword.

                                 <p>Therefore I <hi>Nicholas Drabricius,</hi> a Witneſs of the Veracity of God, (a Witneſs, I ſay, unto my Self, and unto others, the Godly) that the Lord does not any thing, but he reveals his Secret to his Servants the Prophets, <hi>(Amos</hi> 3. 8.)

                                 <p>Our Predeceſſor <hi>John Hus,</hi> about to glorifie God and his Truth, by his Death, ſaid to his Perſecutors, An hundred years being rowled about, ye ſhall anſwer to God and to me.

                                 <p>And becauſe Gods will is according to the words made known unto me poor miſerable man, that they be converted to that Faith given to the Saints, he will therefore certainly take away thoſe ſcandals, and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of ſcandals, men gone into the way of <hi>Cain,</hi> feeding themſelves fat, Clouds without Water, carried about by the Wind; Trees wither'd, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful, twice dead; Waves of the Sea, foaming forth Confuſion; and wandring Stars, to whom is reſerved the Tempeſt of Darkneſs for ever, <hi>(Jud.</hi> 11, 12, 13.) complaining Murmurers, walking after their own luſts, whoſe mouth ſpeaketh Pride and Arrogancy, <hi>(verſ.</hi> 16.)

But She eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more the Dirt of the Earth, (Gold) than the Words of God; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though often admoniſhed, did none of thoſe things: and which is more, was the cauſe why her Sons alſo did nothing about thoſe things. And therefore</hi> God took away Mother, with Father, and Sons, and the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncle Ladiſlaus; one onely Granchild, Francis, being left; To what end, He himſelf onely knows.</p>
                                 <p>But that they object, That the Crown of <hi>Hungary</hi> was promis'd to them; It is true; But the Condition often iterated, That they would purge this Land from Idolatry; deliberating and conſulting upon this matter, with the Eaſtern and Northern: But what did it profit to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh'd?

I will ſhake the Heavens and the Earth, and I will overthrow the Thrones of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms;
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:40863:143"/>
and I will break in pieces the ſtrength of the Nations, &amp;c. And to Chriſt, declaring the diſtreſs and preſſure of Nations, <hi>(Luk.</hi> 21. 25.)</p>
                                 <p>And that I expect, yea, now ſee with mine Eyes, how the Lord over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws the Chariots and the Riders, that every one may fall by the Sword of his Brother, <hi>(Hag.</hi> 2. 23.) And that, by it, the glory of God may be revealed; <hi>That all Fleſh in like manner may ſee that the Mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken</hi> (Iſa. 40. 5.) <hi>by us Two alſo, to you, O Nations!</hi> That the will of God is, That the Beaſt counterfeiting a Lamb, but ſpeaking like a Dragon, together with the falſe Prophet, (that wrought Miracles before him, ſeducing thoſe who had received the Mark of the Beaſt) be both apprehended, and caſt alive into the Lake of Fire, burning with Brimſtone, <hi>(Rev.</hi> 19. 20.)</p>
                                 <p>But the Beaſt being deſtroyed, and the Whore (drunk with the bloud of the Saints, and the bloud of the Martyrs of Jeſus) burnt with fire, (Chap. 17. 16.) That the Kings of the Earth who have committed Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and lived deliciouſly with her, bewail her, and lament for her; ſtanding afar off, for fear of her Torments; and ſaying, Alas! alas!

                                 <p>But at the length <hi>Babylon</hi> being overturn'd, that all Nations of the Earth run together into the Unity of the Faith, and Acknowledgement of the Son of God, unto a perfect Man, unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſs of Chriſt, <hi>(Eph.</hi> 4. 13.)</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <hi>I Drabricius dare, I dare, with the Apoſtle Paul, ſay, That I in my Writings have not ſought my own things,</hi> (as appears others do, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 21.) <hi>but the things which are Jeſus Chriſts; doing nothing through ſtrife or vain glory, but in humility.</hi> (v. 3.)

                                 <p>And becauſe with the Apoſtle, I believe with my Heart, and confeſs with my Mouth, That Prophecy never comes by the will of Man; but holy men of God to be inſpir'd by the holy Spirit, and to ſpeak, (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 21.) Therefore I hope alſo that it will be given unto me, from the Lord and my God, to overcome the malicious Enemies of God and mine, (1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 3.)

Which is not mine Admonition, it is the Apoſtles; That we muſt not judge before the time, till the Lord come, who will inlighten the hidden things of Darkneſs, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 5.)

                                 <p>The impatience of the <hi>Bethulians</hi> did tempt, or try to preſcribe unto God, Bounds of their Deliverance: But they are greatly checkt of <hi>Judith,</hi> becauſe God receives not counſel from men, <hi>(Chap.</hi> 7. and 8.)</p>

We'll conclude onely with a wiſe and ſober Remarque, out of the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of Jeſuitiſm, concerning the Prophecies of St. <hi>Hildegard;</hi> which very well agrees, and may very well be applied to theſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>—Thus far <hi>(ſays he)</hi> the Prophecy it ſelf: Of which, and the like, what to think, and what credit is to be given thereto, others have given their opinion, <hi>viz.</hi> That 'tis not impoſſible, Prophecies and Predictions of this kind, may amount to no more, than the Dreams of melancholy, ſuperſtitious, and diſtempered Perſons: Such as of which, it may be ſaid;
<q>
                              <l>Augurium vanum, vani docuere Parentes;</l>
                              <l>Cui credens dignus decipiatur erit.</l>
                           </q>
                           <q>
                              <l>Our vain Fore-fathers taught's vain Auguries;</l>

                           </q>
But to deny all credit to Prophecies, is to be guilty of an incredulity, greater than that of the incredulous Thomas. Nor are we to think what God ſaith by the Prophet Joel, to be ſpoken in vain; That in the laſt days the old men ſhould dream Dreams, and ſee Viſions; and the Sons and Daughters pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie. Many Examples might be alledged of Prophecies of this kind; which the Events have confirm'd to be true; and therefore they may challenge Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, when they are in their Effects fulfilled. </q>

            <head>An <hi>APPENDIX</hi> of the planting of the Chriſtian Religion in <hi>China,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE marvellous and unheard of Alterations and Troubles; The terrible and bloody Wars, and moſt wonderful Revolutions even of all <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> in this preſent Age likewiſe; but eſpecially of the mighty, antient, and moſt flouriſhing Empire of <hi>China;</hi> have been no leſs aſtoniſhing and ſtupendous, then the <hi>Europaean;</hi> and thoſe ſhameful and curſed ones of Unchriſtian, if not Pagan Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom: But would require another and larger Table to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent alſo a general view thereof. And therefore we ſhall only add an Appendix, according to promiſe, of ſome things remarkable, touching the Introduction of the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into <hi>China,</hi> by the Fathers of the Society; and the Queens, the young Princes, her Son; the Mandarins and Colaos, and chief Miniſters of State, &amp;c. Converſion from Idolatry to Faith in Jeſus; and Worſhip and Confeſſion of the Son of God, ſo nois'd of in the World of late years. And probably, they would have prov'd better Chriſtians and Diſciples under better Maſters and Teachers, then ſuch Apoſtles as have now the glory thereof.</p>
            <p>About the Year 1580<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as ſoon as the Jeſuites had, by fair ſhews of Religion and Learning, found general ſucceſs and acceptance in Europe, and well rooted themſelves here; With great Zeal they compaſs Sea and Land, as far as even the <hi>Eaſt</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:40863:148"/>
               <hi>Indies,</hi> and <hi>China</hi> it ſelf, to gain Proſelytes; After the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the more devout Religious and Zealous Monks and Fryar before them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Riccius<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> at firſt mentioned and <hi>Rogerius,</hi> were the two firſt Fathers, who were order'd to learn the <hi>China</hi> Charecter and Language, and ſent thither. Who at laſt entred into the City <hi>Canto,</hi> but fain to return twice diſappointed of their deſign, till in the end they make a new attempt, furniſhed with all curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; together with a ſolemn Embaſſy, in form, to the Vice-Roy of <hi>Canto;</hi> and ſo were received with all poſſible demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of reſpect; as before hath been related of <hi>Riccius,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In proceſs of time, many were Converted and Baptized<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> among whom were ſome <hi>Mandarines</hi> and Calao<gap reason="illegible: bleedthrough" extent="1 span">

               </gap> (chief Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors and Officers of the Kingdom.) But the Prieſts and Prieſtlings ſtir up Perſecution againſt them, make them odious and abominable, and Teachers of new Godds; impriſon, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and baniſh them. But at length, through the favour of great perſons, they obtain'd freedom and peace, and the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion the more ſpread.</p>
            <p>But by the way, Had the ſame meaſure been meted to the Jeſuites there, by Heathens, as they mete to fellow Chriſtians here; or as we ſay, had they ſerv'd them in the ſame ſauce, they might have had indeed a few Martyrs and Confeſſors per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps; but never Evangeliſts and Preachers, or Apoſtles of the <hi>Chinois,</hi> unleſs at Stake only.</p>
            <p>We ſhall not go about here to give the Hiſtory of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of their proceeding, in converſion of thoſe Infidels and Idolaters; but only preſent you with their Compendium (or Catechiſm) of the Divine Law in the <hi>China</hi> Tongue, as we promiſed at the beginning; together with the Letters of their Queen, and chief Miniſter of State, to the Pope, and their Anſwers, &amp;c.</p>

               <head>A Compendium of the Divine Law.</head>
               <p n="1">1. Perhaps ſome one may ask what God is? 'Tis anſwered, God is no other thing, then the Creator of all things; as alſo the great Governor and Lord of all things, who made the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, who made the Earth, who made Spirits, who made Men.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Heavens, Earth, Men, and all things before were nothing, and afterwards were. Therefore before the Heavens, Earth, Men, and all things, there was ſome Lord neceſſarily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to create them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe all things cannot be made of themſelves; all have that from out of which they are made, or a Maker of them; as Towers, Palaces, and Houſes cannot be made of themſelves, but muſt neceſſarily be the work of ſome Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Therefore the Heavens, Earth, Men and Creatures, how can they be created of themſelves? There is therefore an Author of theſe things, whom we name God. If men do name an Age <hi>Puencu,</hi> and make others like themſelves, and a firſt Grand-father. (Parent.)</p>
               <p n="5">5. Then theſe alſo were, after the Heavens and the Earth were. All had a Father and a Mother, from whom they were procreated. And of theſe, to make a Creator of Heaven and Earth, of Men and of Things, is a great Error.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Some will ſay, The Heavens, Earth, Men, and Things, ſeeing they depend on God in their Creation; I am bold to ask, This God, of whom does he depend in his Creation?</p>
               <p n="7">7. 'Tis anſwer'd, God is the firſt Root and Principle of Things; If he had dependence in his Creation, for that very thing he would not be God.</p>
               <p n="8">8. For things either have a beginning and end; as Herbs, Trees, Fowls, and creeping things; or they have a beginning and no end, as Heaven, Earth, Angels, Devils, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellective
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40863:149"/>
ſouls of Men; God only is without beginning and end, and can give a beginning and end to all things.</p>
               <p n="9">9. If there was not God, there would not be other created things. As for Example, Of one Tree, the Flowers, Fruits, Boughs, Leaves, and Body, are all generated out of the Root. If there be not the Root, for that very thing the reſt will not be. But</p>
               <p n="10">10. Coming to the Root of the Tree, by no means is there another Root, out of which to be ſprung or proceed. God, ſeeing he is the Root and Foundation of all things, out of what other thing can himſelf proceed?</p>
               <p n="11">11. God, when he firſt created all things, in the beginning, he divided the Heavens from the Earth, created all ſpecies (or kinds) of things: Afterwards he created Male and Female; the Male was call'd <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12. The Woman was call'd <hi>Eve.</hi> For theſe two had not Father and Mother, and are the firſt Parents of all People; All elſe (as <hi>Fo Ki,</hi> not excepting thoſe whom they make Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal.) All have</p>
               <p n="13">13. A Father and a Mother of whom they are born; and they could not avoid it, but that ſooner or later they ſhould be corrupted and die. God, ſeeing he is the true Lord of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, Earth, Men, and Things, &amp;c. together withal created all things,</p>
               <p n="14">14. That they ſhould be for mens uſe. Conſequently it altogether behoves us Men to love and worſhip God. By not loving and worſhipping, great ſin is thereupon committed. For example, A couple of Parents produce a Son.</p>
               <p n="15">15. They nouriſh, cloath, educate him. If the Son know not to honour Father and Mother, certainly he is called diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient, and moſt grievouſly ſins. How much more,</p>
               <p n="16">16. Seeing God is the chief Parent of Men, does it not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hove us to love and reverence him, ſince it is now declar'd, what God, the Lord of all things is? It is eaſie to explain the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40863:149"/>
the things of this Age, (or World, that is of Mankind.)</p>
               <p n="17">17. This ſame Man hath naturally two parts, Soul and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. His Body, although it be corrupted and die, his Soul cannot he extinguiſhed, even to eternity. For in this Age (or time of the World) Souls have three differences.</p>
               <p n="18">18. The loweſt Order is call'd the <hi>Vegetative Soul;</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Soul of Herbs and Trees; This Soul helps Herbs and Trees to live and grow. Herbs and Boughs, or Wood cut down, wither and periſh.</p>
               <p n="19">19. Their Soul follows, and is extinguiſhed. The middle Order is called the <hi>Senſitive Soul;</hi> to wit, the Soul of Fowls, creeping things and Beaſts.</p>
               <p n="20">20. This Soul gives faculty (or Power) to Fowls, creeping things and Beaſts, of living and growing; and makes withal that they hear and ſee through their ears and eyes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and taſt and ſmell through their Pallates and Noſtrils: through the reſt of their Members, that they feel pain and pleaſure, but yet they cannot diſcourſe and reaſon; and when they die, even their Soul alſo is extinguiſhed.</p>
               <p n="21">21. The higheſt Order is call'd the <hi>Intellective Soul,</hi> to wit, the Soul of Man. This withal contains the faculty of the two Souls, the <hi>Vegetative</hi> and the <hi>Senſitive.</hi> Therefore it can give a faculty to men of living and growing, together alſo of feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſenſe.</p>
               <p n="22">22. Moreover it gives him a faculty of diſcerning all reaſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to diſcern all things by. His body, although it die, yet his Soul is perpetually conſerv'd, nor is extinguiſhed. Therefore the Men of this Age only fear dead men, and do not fear dead Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals. That ariſes from the natural diſcourſe (or reaſon) of man, that he can animadvert, and think after the death of men. Moreover the Soul of man not dead,</p>
               <p n="23">23. Remains; and therefore can fear. But the Soul of creeping things and Beaſts, is totally diſſipated, not can ſtrike terror into us, ſeeing we know, that the Soul of Man is not
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40863:150"/>
extinguiſhed, it is not withal convenient.</p>
               <p n="24">24. To believe the error of Tranſmigration. It is conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to know in the time of life, to do good and evil; each o<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Heaven: That is the place of remunerating the good. The ſecond place is beneath, and hath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p n="26">26. All bitterneſs; namely, which is called the Priſon of the Earth, the place of puniſhing bad men. For the Lord is moſt highly equal (or juſt.) There is nothing of good which he doth not reward; there is nothing of evil which he doth not puniſh. Nevertheleſs in the preſent Age</p>
               <p n="27">27. There are ſome which do ill, and are rich, honour'd, without trouble, and joyful; There are, who do well, and are poor, contemn'd, and oppres'd with calamity. It is certain God waits till the death of that man, and</p>
               <p n="28">28. After receives the Soul of the good Man, and takes it up into the Court of Heaven to inhabit perpetual felicity; and receives the Soul of the bad man, and ſends it into the Priſon of the Earth, to receive puniſhment without end. If we grant that there are not</p>
               <p n="29">29. Rewards and puniſhments of Paradiſe and Hell, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munerate the men of this Age (or preſent life) who do good or evil; How are the good not deceived then? And how much better a lot and portion do the evil injoy? And how can God be ſaid moſt highly juſt?</p>
               <p n="30">30. Some one will ſay, That reward of good and evil, is it not alſo in the preſent Age, (or life?) How goes the matter? It is anſwered; let us ſuppoſe thoſe that receive the remunera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of good and evil</p>
               <p n="31">31. Altogether to wait, even till after death; On that very account men will be ignorant of the remuneration which is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40863:150"/>
death: And how will it be proved to them that the Lord is above the Heavens. Therefore frequently thoſe who violate juſtice,</p>
               <p n="32">32. Fall into calamities, dangers and troubles, that they may amend their paſt wickedneſſes, &amp; beware of future. Thoſe who are obedient to Reaſon, receive a bleſſing deſcending upon them, to anſwer their good deeds paſt, and ſtir them up to fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p n="33">33. But if any well-doer be in want, in diſhonour, full of labours, and calamities, perhaps it therefore happens, becauſe that amidſt their good works, they have ſomething of evil. Therefore God with theſe things.</p>
               <p n="34">34. Chaſtiſes him at preſent, but after death introduces him into the place of perfect felicity, to injoy perpetual felicity. If any do ill, and yet are rich, honour'd, and happy, according to the Age (or preſent life.)</p>
               <p n="35">35. This therefore happens; Becauſe amids their doings ill, they have ſome good mixt. Therefore God remunerates them with theſe preſent felicities. But after death tumbles them down headlong into the obſcure Priſon; that perpetually they may receive all bitterneſſes.</p>
               <p n="36">36. The men of this Age, if they deſire to avoid deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into Hell, to undergoe all torments, and to aſcend into Heaven, to injoy all felicity. Three things are altogether ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. Firſt,</p>
               <p n="37">37. It is neceſſary to know the Lord of Paradiſe, namely God. For men of this Age to inhabit in one anothers houſe, it is firſt neceſſary to know the Lord of the houſe, then they may enter and ſtay.</p>
               <p n="38">38. How much leſs any one ignorant of the Lord of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, can he aſcend and enter into the place of univerſal felicity. Secondly, It is neceſſary to know the way to Heaven, namely the Law of God.</p>
               <p n="39">39. Men of this Age, ignorant of the way thither, whither
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40863:151"/>
they are a going; by that very means cannot come there. And any one ignorant of the way into Heaven, how can he poſſibly come there?</p>
               <p n="40">40. Thirdly, It is altogether neceſſary to go on through the way which they now know. Becauſe a man, although he knows the way which he deſires to go, yet if he ſit idling at home, and go not forth to make progreſs, by no means will he ever be able to come to his journeys end.</p>
               <p n="41">41. In like manner, he who deſires to aſcend into Paradiſe, the place of all felicity, it is altogether neceſſary, that he do the works of the Divine Holy Law. Some one will ſay,</p>
               <p n="42">42. God is the Lord of Heaven, Earth, Men, and Things; and his Doctrine is withall the way to Paradiſe. Now I have clearly heard and underſtood this. Now I deſire to follow this Doctrine of the Holy God. How</p>
               <p n="43">43. Therefore ſhall I be able to do it? It is anſwered; He who deſires to follow the Holy Law, ought to have two aims. The firſt aim conſiſts in this, That he worſhip God with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect heart, becauſe he is of Heaven,</p>
               <p n="44">44. Earth, Men, and Things, the Univerſal Lord, and crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all things that he might nouriſh us. The ſecond conſiſts in providing for a mans own Soul, to avoid deſcending</p>
               <p n="45">45. Into Hell to receive all bitterneſſes, and obtain aſcent into Heaven, to enjoy all felicities<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He who deſires to obtain this; three things are neceſſary, The firſt of them is, to keep the Commandments of God.</p>
               <p n="46">46. The ſecond is, He ought to blieve the things of God. The third is, He ought to receive Sacred Baptiſm, and to waſh his paſt ſins.</p>

            <p>The Ten Commandments, ſummarily taken, are reduced to two only; To love God above all things, and to love men as ones ſelf. This is that which of old God from Heaven taught and commanded, that they ſhould be honour'd and kept through all Ages. The obedient to them aſcend into Paradiſe, and receive felicity. Thoſe that walk contrary, deſcend into Hell, where they ſuffer torments. The above written Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles are only a Compendium: If any one deſire to have an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute knowledge of the Divine Law, it is neceſſary that he ſtudiouſly apply himſelf to the ſtudy of the Holy Books treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the true Law of God, and go to the Temple of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, to hear the Maſters of the Law come out of the Weſt, Diſcourſing, Diſputing, and Unfolding. Then they ſhall be able to underſtand without doubting: and this thing cannot be fully done in few words. This we have tranſlated, as was requiſite, <hi>verbatim,</hi> according to the property of the <hi>China</hi> Speech, rather then the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
            </p>

they proceed to expound the holy Trinity of the One God; then to the incarnation of the Son of God, the Eternal Word. After to the Sacraments by him appointed for the remedy of Sin; and ſo of all the other Articles of Faith, from firſt to laſt; and when they are well tinctured with theſe, they then innitiate them to a more perfect courſe of the Chriſtian Life.</p>
            <p>And this is the manner how they propound the Chriſtian Myſteries to the Gentiles and Idolaters, beginning firſt with the principal Articles of the One and True God, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the juſt and unjuſt, &amp;c. as in this Catechiſm.</p>
            <p>Beſides this, they publiſhed innumerable excellent Spiritual Books, and Books of Practical Divinity and Moral Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, to which the <hi>Chineſes</hi> are much devoted, and endeavour'd to add to all, rare ſpecimens of an innocent, ſpiritual, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Life, if we may believe their own Teſtimony, which I confeſs Proteſtants in this end of the World have little reaſon to do. For the <hi>Ignatians</hi> of <hi>Europe,</hi> for the generality of them, are more excellent at Fire Works then any thing elſe here; and the works of the Devil, then to work the Works of God. But it's like they were better there; being likewiſe at the beginning of their Order, more Spiritual and Religious, then ever ſince the World hath found them, eſpecially <hi>England.</hi> And yet we have a taſte of their true Spirit, in their obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> Embaſſy there.</p>
            <p>Their firſt great Diſciple was <hi>Paul,</hi> the great <hi>Colao,</hi> or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of the <hi>Chineſes,</hi> and propagator of Chriſtianity among them, <hi>Riccius</hi> put forth many admirable Books in the <hi>China</hi> Language, <hi>viz.</hi> ſeveral Mathematical Books of <hi>Euclid, Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius,</hi> &amp;c.

according to the dictates of right Reaſon, and the rule of a good and happy life. For the <hi>Chinois</hi> were much given to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Philoſophy, and the ſtudy of virtue and happineſs. And <hi>Ten Paradoxes,</hi> Moral and Spiritual, a Book famous through all <hi>China</hi> and in great eſteem and admiration among them, and illuſtrated with Comments and high Encomiums, by the moſt excellent of all their learn'd, <hi>Leo</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> young Convert-<hi>Colao's.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that which wrought unexpreſſible compunction of heart in them for their ill paſt life, (as they ſay) not only among the common people, but the greateſt and moſt learned of their Monarchy, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Mandarins,</hi> and <hi>Colao's,</hi> and Eunuchs of the Kings Pallace, was the Catechiſm of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> tranſlated by the ſaid <hi>Riccius.</hi> The fame of which Book ſpread ſo, that they were fain to print it a new ſeveral times, whereby the Chriſtian Light and Knowledge ſhone into every corner of the Land. With ſeveral other Books for the uſe of others that ſhould come thither out of <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next famous was <hi>Trigautius,</hi> Procurator of the <hi>China</hi> expedition, who return'd from <hi>China</hi> 1612. and return'd thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther again with all manner of Rarities and wrote ſeveral Books for the uſe chiefly of the <hi>Europeans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next Father <hi>Rho,</hi> Profeſſor of Mathematicks in the Jeſuites Colledge at <hi>Milan,</hi> who in a ſhort time ſpoke and wrote their Language like any Native, and wrote ſeveral Books for the uſe of young Converts, and with Father <hi>Schall,</hi> mentioned in the firſt part, laboured in Mathematicks for the benefit of the <hi>Chinois.</hi> Who both by common and joynt ſtudy, put forth above an hundred Books; and eſpecially in emendation of their Calender: he was founder of a Church in the Kingdom of <hi>Sciamſi.</hi>

               </hi> help; ſo that there were Books written by them in the <hi>China</hi> Language by the Year 1636. to the number of 340. The <hi>Mandarines</hi> and <hi>Colao's</hi> alſo, wrote Comments on their Books, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Alſo when their Converts began to be too numerous for the preſent Fathers, they began an Inſtitution of Chatechiſts from amongſt them, to initiate perſons into the Chriſtian My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries. Theſe Catechiſts were perſons much and long vers'd in the Myſteries of Religion, and the Chriſtian Law; and of a very divine Life (better then themſelves 'tis like by far) and ſuch as were inflamed with ſervour of the Apoſtolick Spirit and Zeal for the Converſion of others; and they were not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily admitted unto this Office, but after long experience firſt had of them, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Their work was to go up and down the ſtreets, and on all occaſions by word and example, to bring the rude and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to the knowledge of the True God. And as they have opportunity to ſprinkle Infants and Children with <hi>Holy Water,</hi> to communicate Spiritual Books to thoſe that lack'd; to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve Doubts and Queſtions, &amp;c. And at a certain time of the day, when the Gentiles flock to their <hi>Churches</hi> out of curioſity, to wait there, and to explain the firſt Principles and Elements of the Chriſtian Faith, which were wrote or engraven in fair and large Tables and Characters, (hung up and down upon the Walls, and by their ſplendid Altars) to any that were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous or curious; and to ſhew the vanity of the falſe Godds: And moreover to invite them home for farther inſtruction; And by theſe means they got many Proſelytes daily. They are obliged alſo every day to give an account to the Fathers, that are Superiors in thoſe places, what they have done that day.</p>

               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:40863:153"/>
The number of Chriſtians in <hi>Pekin,</hi> was about fourſcore thouſand, about 1655.</p>
            <p>And though this be ſhort of the Apoſtolick way of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goſpel to the Gentiles; yet they ſeem herein to out-do the Proteſtants, and in induſtry, labours, and zeal, and more abundant then they, to propagate the Faith.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Look here, you Zealous <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> look with ſhame;</l>
               <l>From hated <hi>Jeſuites</hi> learn to ſpread Chriſts Name,</l>
               <l>And Heathens form their Idols to reclaim.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>Things proving thus proſperous, they likewiſe had procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Royal Patent for Power and Liberty to divulge the Goſpel through all the Empire, by the favour of the Grandees of the Court and Kingdom. But the irruption of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> about 1647. interrupted all. Which hapned by reaſon of the Civil Wars of the <hi>Chinois</hi> among themſelves; which invited the <hi>Tartars</hi> to take the opportunity to break into <hi>China,</hi> through the Portal of their great Wall, once more, as they had done formerly before, in the Year 1256. which they held for above 200 years, during nine Kings reigns; but were at laſt beat and kept out again by the <hi>Chinois,</hi> till this laſt ſudden and violent return.</p>
            <p>But now they over-ran it like a flood, and ſubjected all <hi>China</hi> to their Empire; the King of <hi>China</hi> was reduced to ſuch ſtreights, that finding no way to eſcape from his own rebelling Subjects, and ſo great a Monarch forſaken of all, rather deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to die, then live to ſee worſe; ended his dayes in a lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table manner. Firſt, With his own hands killing his Mother and Daughter, and at length grown deſperate, hanged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>Amidſt ſuch great Confuſions of the <hi>China</hi> Empire, the Chriſtians grown to a great multitude, were betwixt hope and fear; and wait with ſollicitous hearts, the new own'd Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors

inclination, and found him in the end more favourable then they could either wiſh or hope for. Eſpecially upon the account of Father <hi>Schall,</hi> before mentioned; as a Stranger of admirable prudence and skill, in the Affairs of the <hi>China</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and to whom he might unboſom the ſecret counſels of his heart ſecurely; and as one highly recommended to him for his rare skill in the computation of Time and Aſtronomy, and other Arts of <hi>Europe.</hi> And ſo made him Mandarine of the firſt Order, and one of his ſupream Counſellors. And ſet him about perfecting the reformation of their Calender, for the Univerſal benefit and advantage of the Kingdom; as before hath been declared.</p>
            <p>After this was the Queen and her Son Converted and Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by the name of <hi>Helena</hi> and <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> of which, her Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Miniſter of her Court, <hi>Pan Achilleus,</hi> long before a Zealous Chriſtian, more then once affectionately wrote Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters thereof, both to the Pope, and to the General of the Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites Society, to ſend more Labourers into <hi>China,</hi> as followeth.</p>

                     <hi>I Achilleus</hi> weigh with my ſelf, that being by Office, Keeper of the Privy Chambers of the Emperor, yet led by error, I alſo take care of the Militia. Whence I have diminiſhed (that is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded or debaſed) my ſelf; and without light, and Diſcipline (that is, Inſtruction) have augmented the multitude of ſins. Long ſince in the Northern Court or Palace, through the good Will of God, I hapned upon men of the Society of Jeſus, who led me, who was rude and ignorant, in the open Path, exhorting me, erring and going aſtray, to follow the Faith. Wherefore, being with reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence expiated in <hi>the Holy Laver,</hi> I then began to underſtand the documents (that is Fundamentals, or Principles) of the Holy Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and its hidden Excellency, and high profundity. And then being immers'd in this ſtudy night and day, with a faithful heart, I have proſecuted it twenty years and more; nor durſt I grow ſlack in the leaſt. So I have procured the help of the King of Heaven, whom I know not how I ſhall be able to anſwer. I had often a mind to come unto your <hi>moſt Holy Throne,</hi> and with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration to ſatisfie my eyes with your <hi>moſt Holy Countenance;</hi>
                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:40863:155"/>
But the matters of the Empire were ſo various, and the Royal Affairs ſo perplexed, as they were; permitted me not to perform the deſires of my intimate Boſome. Wherefore I am moſt highly ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grieved. The onely thought (and grief) now, of me a Sinner, from the bottom of my Soul, is in this, that the calamity of the Empire has not yet ceaſed. Therefore on purpoſe I went and asked a man of the Society of Jeſus, Father <hi>Michael Boym,</hi> that in the next Ship that went away, he would return back to the great Weſt, and come ſuppliant to you, <hi>the chief Prieſt, the moſt Holy Father,</hi> that before the Altar of the Saints, <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> with the univerſal Church of the whole World, with eyes lifted up to Heaven, you would pray to God, that he would look down upon this Imperial Houſe; with mercy help, and conſerve the Empire and ſet limits of future ſpeedy peace; and together would grant, that our moſt wiſe Emperor, who is the eighteenth Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor of this Royal Houſe, and the twelfth Grand-child from the firſt founder of the Empire and Family; That himſelf (as Lord) with his Subjects, may adore Jeſus the Lord of the Heavens. This at length will be the intire happineſs of our <hi>China</hi> Empire. And indeed at preſent, the moſt intire, moſt wiſe, moſt clement, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable Empreſs, of Chriſtian Name, <hi>Helena;</hi> The Queen Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Emperor, of Chriſtian name, <hi>Mary;</hi> The Queen his legitimate Wife<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of Chriſtian name <hi>Anna;</hi> and the Son of the Emperor, Prince and Heir, by Chriſtian Name, <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> do all with humble hearts believe and worſhip the Holy Doctrine; together they have the words of Speech, which they ſend to the <hi>moſt Holy Throne. (viz.</hi> of the Pope) As for me rude Sinner, I humbly beſeech you the <hi>moſt Holy Father,</hi> That for the hour of my departure out of this life, you would vouchſafe <hi>intire remiſſion of the puniſhment of ſins,</hi> and would ſend alſo many men of the Society, into this Empire of <hi>China,</hi> who by their Doctrine may convert univerſally the men of the Age, and may advertiſe them, with Repentance to give good heed to Worſhip, and adore the Holy Law; nor may by a vain and tranſient ſtay, be ſent away with

the Duſt of their Feet ſnatch'd up, (that is, quickly.) So at length I hope to attain Felicity truly never to have an end.

Theſe Things indulg'd to Us, will be Monuments of Your Pious Affections toward Us. But other Things, which are in our Deſires, We are not ſufficient to explain in Words. Onely a man of the Society of Jeſus, Father <hi>Michael Boym,</hi> knows the Buſineſſes of our Empire. We command him to return Legate into the Great Weſt, to propound Our Speech before the <hi>Moſt Holy Father.</hi> He can particularly relate Our humble Will. We truſt in the time of Peace, to ſend <hi>Chine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes Themſelves Legates,</hi> who may preſent Our Duty at the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar of the Saints, <hi>PETER and PAUL,</hi> and offer Reverence.

                  <p>VVE have known from Your Majeſties Letter, how great was the Goodneſs and Clemency whereby the God of gods brought You, wrapt up in blind Errors, and lying Superſtition, out of the Power of Darkneſs, to the knowledge of Light and Truth. He does not forget to ſhew Pity, nor retains His Mercy in Wrath. For when You was a Daughter of This, yet the Omnipotent Lord looked down upon You; who would rather be called, The Father of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, than, The God of Vengeances and Revenges. Now who can ſearch out His Powerfulneſſes! Or find out the Way of His Counſels! Immenſe and vaſt Lands, whereof We have ſcarce heard any thing with Our Ears, the Old Enemy hath poſſeſſed with his Frauds and Fallacies. It was but like a Fable, this mighty Kingdom; no leſs for the Deſarts and almoſt infinite diſtances of Places betwixt; than becauſe the falſe Religion and Worſhip hath took up all things, poſſeſſed

all, over-ſpread all. What acceſs for Truth, through ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Seas, wandrings of Journeys, almoſt another Heaven and Stars; when they were prohibited from all the Shoars, who deſired a commutation of this precious Pearl before Gold and rich Merchandize: And laſtly when they were defended by the impiety of the Mountains continuedly adjoyning to the Ocean, and by Laws and moſt ſtrict Guards. The ſtudy of promoting the true Faith, broke through and overcame all theſe things: By which ſo many Dangers and Difficulties, Your Salvation hath been ſought. Whereby ſo much the more attentively, <hi>Daughter in Chriſt,</hi> You are to recall into Your Mind the Memory of ſo Great a Benefit, and make known theſe things to Your Children, that they may put their Hope and Confidence in GOD, and not forget the Works of GOD, and may enquire into his Commandments. Although alſo to the ſum of Joy which was brought Us, neither was this wanting, That Others alſo inſiſted on Your Example. And the Royal Child <hi>Conſtantine</hi> does no more grow into the hopes of the Kingdom, than of overturning Superſtition. Him truly, as together alſo All, We Fatherly embrace; and moſt lovingly beſtow upon Your Majeſty the Benediction which You ask; and ardently pray God to make Your moſt Diſ-joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Kingdom One with Us, both in Affection and Faith.</p>

Since theſe Tranſactions, the Emperour hath thought fit, within theſe few years, to ſend the Jeſuites out of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys and Dominions; whether for their Good Deeds or Bad Deeds, God knows!
