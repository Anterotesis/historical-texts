            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Which accordingly, God to him, you to me, and I to you performed. And whereof you had then a hastelie catched copy, I now send you the principall: and, so, I doe send it, as dedicated to your name that whither so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it shall happen to come, yea if possibly it may befal any so farre to fansie it, as, by print, to publish it to the world, yet it may alwayes cary with it this frontepiece, for a monument of our mutuall affection, &amp; that singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar regard I have you in: not onely for our conjunction in blood, and these many courtesies and kindly offices
<pb facs="tcp:14704:4"/>
wherof you wearie not to hold me still more and more your debtor: but, much more, for these rare christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, which, in you, are so much the more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendable, as, vailed vnder sweet and christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> modestie, and, in sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glenes eying God, and carefully attending on a good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science, they never were curious, either to be knowen of men, or to currie the applause of the world. Albeit I very well know, that your sincere heart towards God, &amp; constant care of walking christianly with all men, have bred you both the losse of great carnal, and yet but car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal friends, and also, many apparant worldly disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages. In all which losse, your inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parable commoditie is both huge, in the purchase of that one thing which only is to be sought for, and also, passing praise worthy: in that neither any break of duetie to the one, neither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie errour of iudgement, or defect of prudent and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent endeavour, in the other, but a free choise of mind, to forgoe willingly, what you could have easilie either holden or acquired, if you would, but therefore would not for that, in conscience, you ought not, hath made you to count light of such thinges, as the men of this world, madly running after, doe lose both them selves and all these things also: and yet heerein the Lord hath dealt so indulgently with you, as you cannot, but, to the praise of his goodnes and truth, acknowledge the verity of his promise, in a hundreth fold gain, euen in this lyfe. When the other yeare, I was dwelling by you, and, so, was delighted with that sweet conversation and happy fellowshippe, which I can never record but both with regret and ioy, you reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, that, one day, Maister <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Michel</hi> brought <hi>Iohn Fraser</hi> his chalenge to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of Scotland: which, albeit some yeares ere then, it had bene abroad in our countrie, yet I had never seen
<pb facs="tcp:14704:4"/>
nor heard of, before that time: And, after I had read it, he told me how grealty our countrie-Papists did glorie thereof: And, that so much the more as it had receaved no answer: they imputing that to the strength of their owne, and imbecillitie of our cause: he willed me to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider if it were not expedient to say something thereto, I answered him then, that they had not great matter of insulting, for any stuffe which was in that treatise: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to to make any answer it were but to maintain an end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les iangling with men who would never be ashamed to repone vnto vs one and the same, a hundreth times, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted crambe. that nothing was in him which our me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had not often answered: besides, that, whatsoever might have bene done at the first outco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming thereof, yet now when it was stale, and the author departed this life, any particular answer should appeare vorimous. But, as for the matter specially disputed by him, I was about to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish my commentarie vpon the Revelation: whereby I hoped all equitable and judicious Readers should find themselves satisfied of all such doubtes, as by his sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical discourse might arise even to the most simple rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders therof: loving much rather thus to maintain truth, then by contention of disputation. which manner the Church of God hath not, neither mind I for any Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonik braggs of our adversaries to alter this resolution: though even a litle before your last visitation of me, som copies of a new treatise of theirs (inscribed <hi>a litle treatise of the Protestants profane calling, wherein is proved how they have no true Pastours, and consequently no true Church at all</hi>) sparsed here in this part of the countrie (the chiefe stage of their peirt pride) with insolent &amp; high boasting, have thus farre in holy indignation caried me, as, in defence of our callings to pen these few pages. not, particularly
<pb facs="tcp:14704:5"/>
to meet that their treatise, but generally, to refell both it, &amp; whatsoever thing els of any apparant weight (in that argument) alledged by any other. I flee particular co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting loving to cleare points but not to plead with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons: and liking to edifie all, but loathing to scold with any. Albeit, so, I might more clearly discover the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish and ridiculous ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of whosoever is the author of that litle treatise, and expone him more delightful to the Readers derision. but neither desire I so to dally: &amp; I know that a Brother, before me hath vndertaken the taske to tread him &amp; overturne him in his owne traces. This, truly, I must say, that, though in neither of the two either the first challenge or this late little treatise, there be any such thing, as may trouble the resolution of any meanly stayed mind: yet the last, for any apparant shew of skill, commeth as far short of the other, as he is, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, equall with him in high boasting and presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous promising of wonders, but performing nothing at all. Receave then my dear brother, this little piece of my paines, wherein, and in ought that is mine, you may iustly claime a special interest, and receave it for a token of vpright love, as I maintain a iust cause: and howbeit that either for qualitie or quantitie it bee farre vnequall to the certain truth and great worthines of the matter: Yet, shal it, I hope, affoord you an answere heereafter to any who disdainfully insulting would aske, what say you Maisters for your callings: and to bee as good as your word once given, that, vpon covenant the deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders would read it, You should find an answer to that wherein they think vs put to non plus.

Yea, as we have alreadie cleared, that the argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tation from the church, or promises made thereto, to ordinarie Pastors in common, is vicious: and, from the ordinarie Pastours al in common, to vniversallie each one, is much more halting: so, here even from the whole Pastours vniversallie, to the generall counsell, it is still faultie. For no generall counsel can be brought, but that, albeit al, therein, had erred, yet numbers of ordinarie Pastours were besides, who might have holden the truth.

And, such a prophet for vs, let their Pope be, as, who, being continuallie set on lying and murthering, yet never prophecieth true, but when the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verruling power of GOD bringeth some such thing to passe, which, albeit his wordes might beare, yet, he neither mynded not willed. Yea, this example of <hi>Caiphas</hi> so little helpeth them, that, thereby, evidentlie, all whatsoever they bragge of generall Counsels, and of their Pope even in the chaire, is seene to be foolishe. For, I pray you, what instance can they bring of a more lawfull Counsell, or, of a Pope more solemnely sitting in the chaire (as touching

all outwards requisite for the lawfulnes either of persons or ordinarie power) then were, both that whereby <hi>Ieremy</hi> was convicted; and this againe, whereby our Lord was condemned as a blasphemer?</p>
            <p n="18">18. But, as, men, who disput more, for maintayning, any way, their point, then for resolution, being sore pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, doe seeke all corners: so, heere, they alledge, that, howsoever such a decay might have befallen the Church vnder the law: yet, of the Christian Church, vnder the Gospel, in so large a measure of light, and ample promises, no such thing ought to be presumed. Wherein, besydes an evident halting in Logike, is also a horrible &amp; open blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy in divinitie. The fallacie is, that, from the measure of dispensation, &amp; of the promises made, they reason to the truth of God in performing. It is true, that vnder the law, albeit they had one and the same covenant, in substance, and the same promises: yet not in a like measure, or cleare manner of dispensation. Now, heerevpon, to conclude, because God promised not so clarelie nor plentifullie ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, his grace, that, therefore, he performed not alse truelie what hee height: It is, first, a vicious argumentation, and, iuxt, a contumelious blaspemie against the truth of God. For as a true man promising a cottage to one, and a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to another, is alike true in both albeit not alike libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall: so, is God, alwayes, in whatsoever or in what measure soever hee promised. His Church was his Church al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, and, truth, alwayes, was the lyfe of his Church: and, hee prooved, alwayes, alike true, in maintayning it in a sparkle, as hee did in keeping it in a shyning toarch. If they answere, That they doe not meane, that, for the common errour of the Priestes, Prophets and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie Church-men vnder the Law, that therefore, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the promise of God failed, or his Church perished, then, wee have all we plead for. For what, I pray you, let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth him; Or is his arme now shortened; that he may not in the like manner and in the like cases preserve his Church? And, if, in a common apostasie of ordinarie Church-men
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:14704:20"/>
both Prophets &amp; Priestes, he yet hath, heretofore, still had a Church, why doe our adversaries make no end of bitter contention against vs? We have, indeed, great &amp; sure pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises that the gates of hell shall not prevaile against his Church: but that the ordinarie Ministers, shall alwayes, and all, in common, holde the trueth, not one syllable, yea, contrarie, we have not only manie and serious war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of false prophetes to arise in the bowells of the church, &amp; in sheepes clothing, but also most clearlie fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, that such an Apostasie should come, whereby Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ in al effectual deceyt should even sit, and beare rule in the Temple of God. If they will saye, that the Church of Israel had not such promises of continuall presence and preservation of truth, as the Christian Church hath: It is a treacherous sophisme. For they had also sure promises of continuall presence and preservation of truth, according to the measure dispensed, albeit not of so great measure of presence and light. And as for that point, whereof our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries glorie most, and, wherein, now, at last, they are faine to place all defence (namelie, the prerogative of places and persons:) the Church of Israell had much more for them (in so ample and many promises made of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> And to the house of <hi>Levie</hi> and familie of <hi>Aaron,</hi>) where as the Church vnder the Gospell (in which, <hi>neither at Ierusalem, nor in any mountaine,</hi> but every-where, and of all men, God is to bee worshipped in spirit and truth) albeit having great sure promises of presence and preservation: yet, of tying God or his truth to any places or persons, in all Scripture, shee hath not so much as any shew of a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant; which, if the holy Ghost had minded, hee might, with much lesse ado, have reduced those many grave and earnest warnings given both by Christ in the dayes of his fleshe, and by his Apostles, thereafter, of the perill of false prophetes: and those carefull instructions of notes how to discerne and avoid them, to a short and sure com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pende against all fraude: bidding the Church but holde whatsoever the Bishop of Rome did holde, for, that hee,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:14704:20"/>
forsooth, could not erre. If our adversaries yet oppone, that howsoever the Church vnder the Law did sometime fall away all in common, and, that, albeit the Christian Church should also in like manner, yet the truth of God his promises should not therefore faile: but, that no such thing hath befallen the Christian Church, or could befall her: in respect of the great measure of light and cleare di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensation by the Gospell. It is many wayes both foolish, and impertinentlie alleadged, for, first, it is a plaine ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of that which is in question. Next, as the state of our question is (whither possiblie, the Church may erre (<hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muniter tota</hi>) and God his promise yet abyde true) to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pone, that shee hath not erred, is alse ridiculous as, if in disputation <hi>de iure,</hi> one should answer <hi>de facto.</hi> If God his promise still may consist, albeit shee did so erre, wee have the point wee pleade for. And, whither shee hath erred or not, they must of necessitie come with vs to trye by such rules of examination, as wee only labour to reduce them to, and they, in an evill conscience, alwayes, flee: onely crying against vs, <hi>The Te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of the Lord, The Temple of the Lord</hi>: And the Church can not erre. Thirdlie, this their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption of the ones possible and easie falling away, and of the others assured standing in truth, grounded vpon the lesse and greater measure of light, it sheweth their foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishnes in divine matters. For, as, whatsoever measure of light dispensed, is God his free benefite, so is our either imbracing or abyding therein, his only gift. Who as hee iustlie will give over presumptuous and secure men to groape even at noone day,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 10.13.</note> so, is hee faithfull and wil not suffer his owne to bee tempted above that they are able, but will give the issue with the tentation.

But as Christ hath given his spirit to al his sheep, whereby they live spiritually: and, hath left his word to be the only food of his house, for fostering &amp; nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing that life: so, we affirme, that al true sheep, even who hath neither the skill nor the power to be their owne car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, have, yet, by his spirit in them (that vnction which teacheth all things) a spiritual discerning facultie to know what is propined them,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.20.</note> so, as even the weakest in that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie, yet having in any measure, the true gust, albeit, in infirmitie, he wil be brought to muse &amp; doubt, ye &amp; som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time to mistake that for food which is not, yet as a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king after some precious Iewell, though many things in apparance like it, present them selves to him, and even de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his mind, as doubting, but som of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may be his dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: yet this is ever stil without satisfaction of heart. so as he cannot rest nor acquiesce, but still his mind giveth him that he is deceaved. and so hee, still searceth and sendeth after something, which he hath not, as yet, gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and if he could yet but once see, he would sone know. Vpon which having fallen, then as two wel accorded lutes, the one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing stricken, the other also soundeth: so at the first sight,

his heart leapeth and is filled with ioye, his mynd with cleare light, and his soule with solide peace. And, then, he, disdainfully, casteth from him these counterfaits, which he never heartelie embraced. Is it not a strange impuden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, in these men; that, in so manifold warnings, given vs by our Lord, to trye well what wee embrace or hold; and in so faire a facultie affoorded vs by his spirit dwelling in vs, to proove things, that they notwithstanding, dare, so malapertlie, exact, of Christians, a blind obedience, and implicit faith? Who setteth any wares a seale, boasting of their fynesse, and, yet, in any case, will not have them lookt on, or tryed, but, will bee, blindlings, believed vpon his baire word: for me, I would never seeke any greater argument, that hee were a thiefe, and no true marchant. The Romanists plead, stoutlie, that the truth is with them: why? Because they are the Church, and why the Church? Because they have an ordinarie succession of Pastours since the Apostolik tymes. If, here, you vrge, that in so farre as, often, personall succession holdeth not the same doctrine, but, even all, in common, have and may fall therefrom, therefore, to approove themselves true suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours to the Apostles, they must also verifie themselves to hold the same doctrine:<note place="margin">

That no such thing hath befallen, or possiblie could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall the Church. If yet they bee requyred, to bring, then, their doctrine to due examination, by the written worde. No: but you must, <hi>fide implicita,</hi> believe them vpon their word. And, albeit Scripture did seeme never so farre to condemne them, yet you must not suspect any evill of them, why? Because that is onely the true sense of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which they approve, so as you must not so much as doubt, or once call in question their interpretation. And why? Because, foresooth, they are the Church. Is not this, proudlie to mocke God; and, impudentlie, to delude men? Is not this, to picke out the eies of the worlde,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:14704:28"/>
to cary them, blindfolded, as oxen, to the slaughter; and, as fooles to the stockes, for correction? Augustin, pleading for the truth, and, having, trulie, for him all, which our adversaries doe, falslie, glorie of: yet, sheweth, that he was of another spirit, which taught him, that verity was other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to bee defended, then by such subterfuges, as they, in an evill conscience flee to.<note place="margin">

To disproove this power of plaine and prevayling truth, and, to discredit the argument of our miraculous successe thereby: our adversaries yet ryse against vs with two obiections. The first is, that, if successe and wyde obtayning were a note of truth, then also, or more iustlie, might Arrianisme and Mahometisme acclaime the title thereof, as wee. But, these instances are sophisticallie, brought against the truth and vs. For, albeit wee confesse heresie to bee verie contagious, and the word thereof to be fretting as a gangrene: through the conveniencie it hath with the vaine humour of man, who is, naturallie a lyer: yet when soever it is put to iust tryall by the truth, then can it retaine no strength. It is indeed, true, that truth alwayes prevayleth not. (for then, the mysterie of iniquitie had never attayned to such height,) but, this falleth not through the weaknes of truth, but partlie, through the vanity of men, who falling away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the love and due regard of truth, are, in God his iustice, given vp to the efficacie of errour: Partlie, through their vniust furie,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:14704:32"/>
reiecting and persecuting the truth vntryed. wherein, yet the great odds betwixt veritie and lyes, is wonderfull: in that, even in the highest degree of prevailing error (while Satan hath a throne in the verie temple of God) yet,<note place="margin">

Whereas, on the other part, truth being but admitted to plead for it selfe, albeit the holders have little strength (as,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.</note> in <hi>Philadelphia</hi>) yet, the adversaries are forced to come and worship at their feet. But, this we maintaine and hold, that when ever it pleaseth the Lord to send out his light and truth for leading men to his holy mountaine:<note place="margin">

Their argument is a deceitfull falacie by confounding of divers cases and causes: of the truth admitted to plead, and of the same, againe, after in God his iustice hid, or, by mens cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and vniust violence, debarred from all defence. And, this is evident, in both the alleadged instances. For, Aria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme, albeit having, for it, great (but vnsanctified) both learning and eloquence, yet was ever ashamed before the truth: till by the crueltie and violence of Easterne Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, in <hi>Asia,</hi> and by the Barbarous feretie of <hi>Vandall</hi> and <hi>Gothik</hi> Kings in <hi>Africk</hi> and <hi>Europe,</hi> it was inforced. and yet, neither, so, could it ever either beare downe the truth, or continue long vngone in smoke before it. As for Mahometisme, nothing bred it, but preceeding degrees of Antichristian darknes &amp; decay of light in the Church: and, with Antichrist his arysing to a heigh, it, still, increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed as, which was both an effect thereof, and, in God his wrath,<note place="margin">

            <p>But, in the Church, alwayes, even in time of greatest corruption, the Sacrament of Baptisme, in substance, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, &amp; the doctrine of the Trinitie was keeped sound.
<q>
                  <p>Therfore, the Church alwayes, even in time of greatest cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, held the foundation. and, consequently, no place was at any time in her, since her first constitution, to extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie calling.

            <p>The proposition hath an equivocation: which to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and, so, to avoid the deceit intended thereby, I distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishe thus. If by the Sacrament of Baptisme, in substance, bee vnderstoode all the substantiall matter by Baptisme
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:14704:40"/>
represented to our knowledge, sealed vp through faith in our conscience, and, all the grace thereby, through the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operation of the holy Ghost, conferred to vs: and, if by the doctrine of the Trinitie, be vnderstood whatsoever we are taught and doe beleeve of that triple one, either in himself or his dispensation towards vs, and our duetie againe to him: in that sense, I yeeld the proposition to be true. But, if by the Sacrament of Baptisme, in substance, remaining, be vnderstood only the sacramental action in the substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall rites thereof, so making it still to bee counted lawfull baptisme in substance, albeit otherwayes, miserablie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with many superfluous and superstitious ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies: and, if by the doctrine of the Trinitie, no more be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood but that only one point of God one in substance and three in persons: without which, and the solemne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation thereof in baptisme, even the substance of that Sacrament were abolished: then the proposition is clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie false. And the proponer would but illude in the words <hi>Substance and Doctrine.</hi> except hee will affirme, that, for the foundation of our faith, no more were requisite but these only two points. And thus, (outtaking <hi>Samosatenus, Sabel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius, Arrius,</hi> and <hi>Manes,</hi> and such others as, either before or after them, vnder whatsoever divers names, symbolized with their particular errours) all heretikes of whatsoever sect or tyme shalbe reputed to have holden the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. So shall <hi>Nestorius, Eutiches,</hi> and <hi>Appollinaris</hi> bee absolved from fundamentall errours: so shall the denyers of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection: so shall the followers of spirits of errours, and teaching doctrines of devills: so shall the <hi>Nicolaitans</hi> teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and committing fornication and idolatrie, have kept the foundation. Shall not the incarnation of the aeternall Sonne; the personall vnion of the assumer and assumed; the naturall veritie of both natures in that one person; bee counted foundamentall? Shall not the onely mediation and merit of that Person; his Propheticall, Priestlie, and Royal offices, and actions thereof; the perfection, efficacy, and vertue of all, be counted foundamentall? Or shall the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:14704:40"/>
bare holding of GOD one in substance and three in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons bee any foundation at al to such as in the other points doe overthrow it? It is strange that one acknowledging that the baptized by heretiks are not to bee rebaptized, &amp;, consequently, acknowledging the baptisme ministred by them, to be baptisme in substance: which yet it could not be without the invocation of the Trinitie: should yet, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> baptisme remayning in substance, and that one point of the trinitie of persons thinke the foundation to be kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, when not onely open perverters and direct oppug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of foundamentall points, but also adders of anie other to that only one foundation (by the Apostle his sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence) doe even fall from the foundation which, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, they would appeare both to professe and keepe. The Sacrament of Baptisme and sounde doctrine of the Trinitie still kept in the visible Church, and even in <hi>tota communiter,</hi> was ever a sure and free entrie, and, as <hi>Augustin</hi> speaketh, <hi>opportunum inquirendi exordium</hi> (a common and convenient beginning to inquire by: but yet so, as who, thereby entring, held the straight course to the Temple, where were the Candlestickes and the Olives, and to mount Sion, where was the Lambe: These, indeed, held the foundation, and the gates of hell never prevayled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them. But, who entring by that common entrie, declyned from the right way leading to the Temple and mount Sion: and, did fall aside vpon, and rest in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon pollution of Citie and Court: following, wonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring after, and worshipping the Beast and the Dragon (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven that abhomination of desolation, standing also with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the visible Church, <hi>in Sanctis Ecclesiae locis,</hi> as sayeth Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome,) these fell so from the foundation, as, even that which to the others was the entrie and faire way to the Temple and Mountaine, was to them of no more value, then if they had never entered at all. For that, in missing of the rest, they loosed even that also, which otherwayes they appeared to have, as, in the foundation of a large Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, who raiseth so the building as hee keepeth but one
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:14704:41"/>
stone of all, must of necessity even fall from that also: and bee no otherwayes said to hold the foundation then <hi>Saul</hi> pleaded that hee had fulfilled the commandement of the Lord, which, notwithstanding, the Prophet affirmed hee had casten away, and, therefore was justly cast away of the Lord from being king of <hi>Israel.</hi> Thus, then the proposition of his argument being evidently false, his conclusion also faileth, and my two places doe well and clearly consist. And, considering how we doe charge the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> with intollerable prevarications, almost, in all fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall points (against that one GOD, in giving his glorie to creatures: against the verity of Christ his humane nature by their prodigious transubstantiation: against al his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation, offices, and actions thereof, by many fold and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegious derogation, vsurpation, mutilation, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of all the perfection, fruit, force, and effect thereof) so as the censurer cannot dissemble the cleare knowledge of my meaning in granting them the Sacrament of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme in substance, and sound doctrine of the Trinitie; in this consideration (I say) how can his challenge of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, in my wordes, bee excused of either childish triffling, or shameles cavillation; or both?</p>
            <p>Now, albeit what I have already said, aboundantlie serveth for reconciliation of the other place signed also by my censurer, yet let vs see what is the contradiction hee would inferre thereupon. My wordes, and continuallie, following the former, are these: <hi>But if corruption hath so farre prevailed that the faithfull City hath become an harlot, and all her silver be turned in drosse: if her husbandmen have become murtherers and her builders have become destroyers: if from the Prophet even to the Priest everie one followeth after lyes: if there be a conspiracie of her Prophets in the mids of her like a roaring Lyon ravening the pray: if her watchmen be all blind and know nothing: if they be all dumb doggs and can not barke: if they lye and sleepe, and love to sleepe: if her Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours know nothing nor vnderstand, and looke whollie to their owne wayes: if night bee to them for a vision, and darknes for a divination: in such a case, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:14704:41"/>Now, to commit my selfe, with my selfe, he would, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearantly, reason thus:
<q>
                  <p>Extraordinary vocation (by my owne position) hath only place in such a corrupt state and case of a Church, as that the faithfull City hath become a harlot, and all her sylver is turned in drosse: her husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dmen are become murtherers, etc.</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But, the case of the Christian Church even in tyme of greatest corruption was never such.
<q>
                  <p>Therefore, by myne owne position, no place, was in her, at any tyme for extraordinarie calling. And, so, I am contradictour to my selfe.</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The Proposition is mine owne. The Assumption (of the visible Church) is false. And hee seeketh to succour it from my Position thus:
<q>
                  <p>Of a Church keeping the Sacrament of Baptisme, in substance and sound doctrine of the Trinitie, no such case, as I have put, can be truely affirmed.</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But, by mine owne position, the Church, even in tyme of greatest corruption, hath keeped the Sacrament of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme in substance, and sound doctrine of the Trinitie.
<q>
                  <p>Therefore, of the Church, at no tyme, such a case could bee truely affirmed. And consequently, no tyme ever for extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie calling. VVhich, by mine owne Position, hath only place in such a case.</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The aequivocation of the Proposition, I cleared in my answere to his first conceaved contradiction. Now, in the sense, ther, shewed to be mine, a church, holding only these points, albeit shee erre in, yea and overthrow most part of all other foundamentall grounds, and, consequently, even these same which she seemeth to hold, also: that, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, the holding, barely, of these, may vindicat her from the blame of my proponed case, I even muse if my challenger will affirme it. And, that (taking hold, perhaps, on the peremptorie and precise strictnes of the wordes) he would, thus, reason: that where but even so much is holde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as I have yeelded, &amp; even in the sense I have called myne, there, all cannot bee turned in drosse, neither can Pastours,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:14704:42"/>
there, be said to know nor vnderstand nothing, &amp;c. and consequentlie, that no such case, as I have put, hath ever be fallen, I will hardlie be induced to beleeve, or that a man of any sense or shamefastnes will bewray himselfe to be so ridiculous a jangler. Wherein yet he should not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with me, but with the Lord, whose the wordes are, and not mine: and who chargeth therewith a Church holding more of the foundation, then ever we will grant to the Church of Rome: who, in the abhominations she doth commit, hath iustified the Church of Iuda, of whom the Lord affirmed my proponed case: and, which, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, more iustlie, a great deale, might have alledged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the precise strictnes of the Lord his accusatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. They held the Sacrament of circumcision, the name of the God of Israell, the outwarde profession of his Covenant and worshippe; and the publike practise thereof in dayly sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices &amp; oblations. And, had they place, herefore, to plead, that all their silver was not turned in drosse? The Lord, in challenging our defections, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the substantial grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds are most parte subverted, hee pleadeth a totall apostasie. His owne <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> telling howe, iudiciouslie, to reade and make right vse of the sayings of the Fathers, might have taught your man, that in Homilies to the people, where, in vehement contestations, speaches are, of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, framed, rhetorically, and hyperbolically to force of perswasion, for sturring motion, and for agreaging and amplification: they are, then, to be wyselie distinguished from a scholastike and more presse and proper maner in laying down foundamental points: and, that they are not to be alike or indifferentlie drawn for stablishing or proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving heads of faith, in the praecise strictnes and proprietie of wordes. for, one and the same man will have a much different maner of stile in homilizing and in dogmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing. Not that, therefore, the Fathers, and much lesse, the Lord (who though all men were lyers, yet abydeth true) did say <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

And, the receaver of outward ordinary vocation, as he hath all gift and grace from God only, whose the worke is, so is he not tyed or sworne to the will or appetit of the outward Minister, but only to the Lord: no more then any Minister, Baptizeth in his owne name, but in the Lord his, whose badge and cognissance only we take on, thereby, and not of the Minister thereof, &amp;c.</hi> I will not thinke my remarker so remarkeably grosse, as that he thinketh the efficacie of the Sacraments to depend on the worthines or vnworthines of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster thereof. for, in the contrary of this, I hope wee doe both agree. and, againe, that he, who holdeth ordination to be a Sacrament no lesse then any of the other, wil deny the same common case of it also, I have no reason to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine: Neither yet, for my similitude, taken from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon condition of Sacraments, that therefore, hee would think me to make ordination also a Sacrament (with him) in the most strict and proper signification. for, the simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of things, in some cases, maketh not things, alwayes, to be the same. and, thus farre, I hope wee shall accord in the truth and convenience of my similitude: that, as the Minister of Sacraments (having still outward place and power) neither conferreth inward grace, for any worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in him, neither letteth the collation thereof through his vnworthines, so, neither doth the vnworthines of the ordainer (having <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

For, there is but one Lord who hath led captivitie captive, &amp; giveth gifts to men: my adversarie wil confesse this also, that fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what Bishop soever the Sacraments may be receaved (except Baptisme, which, in honour of Christ, forsooth, he relegateth not only to Woemen but even to Iewes and Turkes) from the same Bishop ordination, may
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:14704:43"/>
be receaved also. but, as I can scanse at his meaning, hee thinketh my errour to be, in this remarkeable: that, to him, I appeare to make it all one thing or alike to receave the Sacraments or ordination from a Wolfe or Thiefe, as to rereave them from a hyreling or reprobate. which, if I did, absolutly, hold, and did accordingly, reason, from the one to the other: it were, indeed, a manifest halting in Logike, and therewith, no sounde point of Divinitie also. The course of my argumentation, in my treatise, is so at length and evidently led, and my cases so clearly put, as, I am sure, no vpright hearted Reader could ever have fallen vpon so sinistrous a conception. but, it is the maner of men, who read only to resist, to snatch at syllables, and wrest parcels of mens speaches so to maintaine iangling. And seeing that my remarker, albeit hee hath busied himselfe most, yea, and almost, only on the 6.7. and 8. sections of my Treatise (as his tokens left thereupon well shewe) yet even there hath vnderstood least, and, either hath not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaved, or deceitfully dissembled my meaning: I will, therefore, heere, summarily resume the substance of my matter, and drift of my discourse there.</p>
            <p>Vpon the prerogative of the Bishop of Rome, a long tyme reputed head of the Churche, and all ordinarie vocation flowing (in that respect,) either mediatlie or immediatly from him, our adversaries labour to inferre against vs, that either we have never had any lawful ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation at all, or then have fallen from it. Because, that the Bishop of Rome was, then when our ordination flowed from him, either the Antichrist (as wee affirme) and, consequentlie, beeing a Wolfe and Thiefe, could have no power of ordination: or then a lawfull Pastour hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding truth: in which case, wee falling from his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, have fallen from the truth, and all lawfull vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation also. against this (to shew howe, in that, which, in the pamphlet that came to my hands, was inscribed the invincible argument, there is no more vigour then in a roape of a rotten rushe) I laid down this contrary position.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:14704:44"/>
That our outward ordinarie callings did, in a sort, flow from the Bishop of Rome, without any discredit or dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to the dignity or lawfulnes of them: notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that he is that verie Antichrist and man of sinne: and, so, not onely a Wolfe and Thiefe, but even of al other the most execrable. The summe of that argument, whereby to inferre this my Position, and which, at large, I did set downe in my treatise, and the mentioned sections thereof, is this.
<q>
                  <p>From a VVolfe or Thiefe, who, descending in an ordinary succession from good and lawfull Pastours at first, and who degenereth not at once, but by long and slow degrees, and, that, not, as an open outward enemy directly oppugning the ensigne, but, still, pretending Christ his power and service, and, covertly, by pretence of the ensigne, deceaving: before he be detected and knowen to be a Traitour, VVolfe, &amp; Thiefe, and, so, retaining still, with all, in common, the account and place of a lawfull Pastour: lawfull ordination may flow: and the ordained by him, taking ordination vprightly as from a lawful Pastour &amp; reputed so still, in common, not knowing nor beeing partakers of his treason, may even, so, have lawfull outward vocation: and, falling from their ordainer, eftsoones detected to bee a VVolfe and Thiefe, yet stil retain the prerogative of their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings.</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But, such a Traitour, Wolfe, &amp; Thiefe was the Bishop of Rome, what tyme our ordination, in a sort, did flow from him; before it was said to the revived witnesses, <hi>come vp hither,</hi> Revel. 11. &amp; he proclaimed a Traitour 14.8. and al, thereupon, interdicted his worshippe, and character 14.9.
<q>
                  <p>Therefore from the Bishop of Rome, our outward callings, in a sort, might flow: and, wee shrinking from him (now declai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Traitour) yet still retaine the prerogative and priviledge of our callings.</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>In the tenour and drift of this argument (that divers points &amp; cases be not ignorantly or deceitfully confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, either to the obscuring or perverting of my meaning) two things are, heedfully, to be eied, and the distinct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:14704:44"/>
of them. First, my Positions: and, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>se distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, als well the speciall and definit position which I take to proove, as the generall and indefinit which I bring for a mids or argument to inferre the other. And, secondly, the restrict cases of both. The speciall definit position, which I take to proove, is the conclusion of my sillogisme. The generall and indefinit, whereby I conclude it, is the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position thereof: the restrict case of my speciall and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit position is, that, I affirmed not our callings to have flowed from the Bishop of Rome, absolutly, but, <hi>in a sort.</hi> The restrict case of my generall and indefinit position, is, that I affirmed not lawfull ordination might be taken of a Wolfe or Thiefe, absolutly, but from such a Wolfe &amp; Thiefe as in my Proposition is set downe at length, and in my treatise, more amply. Now, who either doth confound my positions, or draweth them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> my restrict cases to absolut assertions, he wrongeth me, therein, greatly. And to cleare this. In the restrict case of my speciall and definit position, that I affirmed our callings to have flowed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Bishop of Rome, <hi>in a sort,</hi> it hath two considerations to be wel ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted. First, that the Bishop of Rome was not the proper, particular, &amp; personal minister of their ordination (at least in common) howsoever <hi>in a sort or mediatly,</hi> it did flow from him. Secondly, that even this <hi>in a sort or mediatly,</hi> must not be so vnderstood as if the particular, proper, and personall ordainers had done it but as the Bishop of Rome his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties or procurators: but, as having also themselves pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly place &amp; power of ordination. Wherein, (by your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries doctrine) the Bishop of Rome might well have the first place and highest power: but, not the only place or onely power. For, giving him this that he were, not only, <hi>primae sedis Episcopus</hi> (in which degree the Fathers would faine have stayed his vsurpation, and yet by canons of counsels, could not) but, (which was, then, interdicted) that he were also <hi>primus Episcopus:</hi> yet was hee never sole Bishop. And, though hee got at length, (by prevailing iniquity) cheefe place &amp; power of ordination, yet never only place. For, if
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:14704:45"/>
hee onely were properly to bee held a Bishop, and, if or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination were only proper to him, then could not he him selfe be any Bishop at all. For none can be a Bishop with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out lawfull ordination: and none can or may ordaine him selfe. Neither can any other ordaine him by any power flowing from his predecessour, <hi>quia mort<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> mandatore expirat mandatum.</hi> And, as Grogorie Bishop of Rome doth inferre, if he were sole Bishop, then, <hi>vniversa Ecclesia corruit vbi ille vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versus cadit,</hi> (he falling, the vniversal church should faile al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so.) And, how hardly the said Grogory did esteeme of any such vsurpation, these words doe shew. <hi>Triste valde est patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter ferre vt omnibus despectis, frater &amp; coepiscopus noster solus nominetur Episcopus.</hi> (It is a heavy and hard matter to beare that our brother and fellow Bishop should be called onely Bishop) and he giveth the reason in another place. <hi>Quia si vnus Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archa vniversalis dicitur, Patriarcharum nomen caeteris derogatur,</hi> for if one be called vniversal Patriarch, the name of Patriarch is taken from the rest) so, then, is ordination of all Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men flowing <hi>in a sort fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Pope,</hi> to be vnderstood: not, that either hee was the personall minister of all, or that hee had sole power of ordination: but, because he was acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged first in that power: and, for that, in the outward order, policy, and forme of church governement, al did acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge their subiection to him. Now, for that ordination is graunted to flow from him in this sort, therefore, vpon the conviction of him to be a Wolfe &amp; Thiefe; shal al ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the church, particularly, properly, and personallie ministred by whatsoever other Bishops, be vnlawfull? Or, shal he (convinced to be a Thiefe and Traitour) necessarily involve al other pastours of the church in the same guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes with him, because their ordinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath, <hi>in a sort,</hi> flowed from him? This were indeed, to admit that, which even a Bishop of Rome counted an execrable absurdity, <hi>quod vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versa Ecclesia corruit vbi ille vniversus cadit.</hi> your man might have learned from his owne Bellarmin (by force of truth driven thereto at last) that, though the Pope should become an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retike, yet should not the church therefore fail, or fall from
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:14704:45"/>
truth. We wil never yeeld him this, that at any time in the church, vniversally all and singularly each pastour, or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainers of pastours were Wolves and Thieves, albeit wee affirme that he from whom al ordinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>in a sort,</hi> did flow, was, long agoe, a Wolfe and Thiefe. Now, then, I having, in the special and definit position of our callings flowing from the Bishop of Rome, put this restrict case, that they flowed from him <hi>in a sort</hi>: hee should greatly wrong me &amp; sophistically also reason, who would make this all one thing, as if I had granted them to have flowed from him particularly, as the proper &amp; personal minister thereof: or, from the Wolvish &amp; Thievish condition of him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whom they but flowed <hi>in a sort,</hi> would conclude of all and everie particular, proper, and personal ordainers: or if hee should reason from ordinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as it floweth <hi>in a sort,</hi> to ordination properly and personally proceeding. My remarker might indeed have made me remarkeably forgetfull of my selfe &amp; truth both, if in my answere to their first obiection (sect. 5.) not admitting them therfore, any iust claime in the title of the true church, for that we, forsooth, could have no orditnary vocation but with &amp; amongst the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (who, howsoever they were in the church &amp; even bore sway and obtained <hi>in tota communiter,</hi> yet were but a part in the church, and no true part of it: in that, alwayes, within the church also were true both pastours and professours) if now (I say) I should againe confesse that all our pastours ordination had flowed properly and personally from the detestable head of all that mischiefe. Which were not onely a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest lie but an absurde impossibilitie also. If any heere, would oppone, that this my distinction is vaine, and, that it freeth vs nothing more to have had our ordination but <hi>in a sort</hi> from the Bishop of Rome, and properlie and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonally from others, then if we graunted the having it of him even particularly, properly, &amp; personally: because all others particular and personal ordainers whatsoever, <hi>were not onely in outward order of Church governement subiect to the Pope of Rome:</hi> but also agreed all in one and the same faith
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:14704:46"/>
and doctrine with him, approving both his opinion and power: and, moreover, had all of them, or their ordainers or the ordainers of their ordainers, &amp;c. their ordination even properly and personally of the Bishop of Rome. In which respects, neither could the personall ordainers bee free of any imputation laid by vs against the Bishop of Rome, neither yee ordination from them be any better to the ordained by them, then if it had properly and perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally proceeded from him, as the particular Minister ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I answer that in this allegation, is a manifold sophisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. First, as I have already shewed, from common sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection in the obtaining state of Church policie, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude Vnitie in opinion and all points of faith: and, from the overruling Pope, or Metropolitan his corruption and guiltines, to conclude the same of al, who by the course of the time, and prevailing lawes of Church governement are, ordinarilie subiect to him, it is, even in common ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, ridiculous, and, albeit of all, in common, it might, perhaps, be said, yet never of vniversally each one: as, in my treatise, I have shewed at length, &amp;, in my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarie on the Revelation, more plainly. Secondly, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ld thus conclude from toleration to approbation, most falsly. For many did tolerate the evils and vsurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which they never approoved but even detested and lamented: as did the Church in <hi>Pergamus,</hi> dwelling even where Satan his throne was: and the Church of <hi>Thyatira,</hi> where <hi>Ie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>abel</hi> vnder proud pretence of propheticall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, impudently domined. Against which Churches, howsoever the Lord had some thing, for that their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: yet, were they, no the lesse his true Churches: and, as taxed for toleration of the obtaining &amp; proudly borne out evill amongst them: so on the other part even praised for keeping the name of God, and for increase of workes, even there, where Satan his throne was, and Fornication and Idolatrie craftilie and proudly set forwarde: which, yet, and the (first) subtill, and (nixt) proud and cruell v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpation of the committers, teachers, and imposers therof,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:14704:46"/>
they had not the either knowledge or courage to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge, directly, in the tyme. And, in these two Churches, the holy Ghost, in a depth of wisdome, and purposelie, set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth downe the type of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition of his true church first and last in the mids of Antichrist his vsurpation, &amp; all the tyme within his compas. Thirdly, in alledging that al ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving place &amp; power of ordinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or then their ordainers, or, at least, the ordainers of their ordainers, &amp;c. have recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ordination even personally and particularly from the Bishop of Rome: besydes that, for many ages after Christ no such vsurpatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was knowen or had place in the Church: &amp; that even after the first proud acclayming thereof many churches stood long out &amp; refused the yoak: in reasoning even from the stare of the prevailing tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ny since the time it tooke place, there is a double fallacy. First, in not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishing betwixt any one particular Bishop of Rome, and the Bishop of Rome in succession of seat. And, next confounding the different and much divers consideration of distinct times, and of an evill, in time, waxing, and by degrees, arrysing from not so intollerable beginnings at first, to the height, at last, of al detestable mischief and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable impiety. If any should affirme the personall and proper ordination of all ordainers, or, of their ordainers, or at least, of the ordainers of their ordainers, &amp;c. of any one particular Bishop of Rome, hee were senseles. If, of, the seat: then the answere is easie: that none shall ever be able to shew it so possibly personall, in that sort, throw all the visible Church: but, that, in a succession of many Bishops, and these (singularly) almost all, of short aboade; and litle painfull in the personal actions of their calling, &amp;, in the progres (as I have said) of a waxing evil: we may easely and clearely evince not onely a probable but even a plaine possibility of preserving and reducing vpward lawfull ordination in the Church (at least in freedome from all personall contagion of that pestilent seat) to some more tolerable times &amp; a lesse corrupted state of a church.</p>
            <p>Thus have I cleared the speciall and definit position
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:14704:47"/>
of our outward ordinarie callings flowing from the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Rome, and restrict case thereof. Which position, as it was the conclusion of my syllogisme, and al that I either affirmed or tooke to proove of them: so will I never grant the Bishop of Rome any furder interest in them. And, thus, the flowing of our vocation <hi>in a sort</hi> from him (even con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed to be and to have then bene the very Antichrist) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogateth so litle either to the dignity or lawfulnes of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: as, though it were granted that not only not from him, but even from no Wolfe or Thiefe any proper or personall or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination might be lawfully receaved, yet our ordination, and flowing, <hi>in a sort,</hi> from the Bishop of Rome (the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ) may bee well sustained to bee lawfull. Neither am I thus precise in the special case of our ordination, because I think my selfe so straited (in granting even personall and particularly ministred ordination by a Wolfe and Thiefe, in some case to bee lawfull) as that therefore I would nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly seeke out this evasion: but, because it were foolishe prevarication to staine the honour of our vocation more then is necessarie, by yeelding any furder place therein to Antichrist his contagion, then the nature of the case and truth of story enforceth: for, as in the Church, alwayes, even in most miserable tymes, have beene some (albeit few) lawfull and true pastours, so, consequently, alwayes, some remnant also of lawfull ordination. And, I pray you, with or amongst whom could it possibly remaine; but these, who were, first, the Candelstikes and Olives (ministers of light and grace) while no possibilitie ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared of any: and, for applying the right rodde of exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination whereby Citie and Court were found to bee cast out, were next cruellie murthered: and yet Thirdly, in vigour standing vp against Antichrist, were at last separated so from his contagion, as thencefoorth Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon falleth, and they beare away the name of heaven, the true church? Now then, howsoever, in the special case of our ordinarie vocations, and <hi>in facto,</hi> (as Iuristes speak) I will yeeld no more then my position thereof beareth:
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:14704:47"/>
yet, <hi>in jure,</hi> I have not forgotten what my generall and indefinit position speaketh: neither mynde I so to slyde from it. But, as I brought it for my argument, whereby as from the more to the lesse, to inferre my speciall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition: so will I, now, come close to your man his hande: and although no necessitie of maintayning our callings co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>straine me thereto, yet, for cutting from him of all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of cavillation, even graunt this also to be my position.</p>
            <p>That from a Wolfe and Thiefe (such as my proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion proporteth) lawfull Ordination may bee even pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlie and personallie taken as from the particular mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister thereof. And, (to bee yet more indulgent to my Remarker then hee, perhaps, exspecteth) that, in that case, it might even so have beene taken from the Bishop of Rome also. Whereupon, if my Remarker marketh mee as holding that Ordination may bee lawfullie ministred by, or taken from a Wolfe or a Thiefe, absolutelie, hee hath taken his markes by the Moone, or then by his owne ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations: whereto my wordes will never affoorde him any ground. For, besides all that, which the tenour of my Discourse, on that parte, did clearlie expose to anie not wilfullie wincking even over against his [REMARK] was put the restriction of a Wolfe, <hi>Retayning ordinarie place and power of Ordination.</hi> If there he had thought, that these two can not consist: to bee a Wolfe and a Thiefe, and yet to retayne place and power of ordination, from which, even thereby, hee doeth fall: yet, he might have remembred to distinguish betwixt a Thiefe without, and a Thiefe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. And againe, of inward Theeves, betwixt a Thiefe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected, notore, noted, and proclaimed to be a Thiefe, and a Thiefe still covered vnder false pretences, and, so, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning with all in common the reputation, if not of a true or faithfull, yet of a lawfull Pastour. Hee should not separate my position from the restrict case thereof. For, as calling is double, outwarde, and inwarde, and, a man may have the inwarde calling (by a convenient measure of gifte, and a Divine motion to consecrate
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:14704:48"/>
it to the giver) who hath not yet gotten outward ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and, againe, one may have outward lawfull calling, who, inwardly, hath none, but, by the contrarie, is even a Thiefe in his heart: so may an ordinary Pastour, being, or beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming a Traytour and Wolfe, fall, so from all inward vocation, and, yet retaine, still, outward place &amp; power of ordination, because, albeit a Traitour &amp; Thiefe, his treaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> notwithstanding, is not yet detected: whither through his owne craftie cariage &amp; deceitful pretences, still, of a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Pastour: or, through the simplicitie of these, who, recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ordination of him, ar not skilled to discerne his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, albeit even then deeply and pertly practised, Who, if they knewe it, and yet, would receave ordination of him: as they could not but, in that case, be Traitours also, and have no ordination at all: so, comming, in singlenes, to him, as to a lawfull Minister, and so accounted of all, in common, through the pretence of his Lord his ensigne and service: they may (that way) receave from him a lawfull ordination, the hidde or vnperceaved defect of the ordainer no more derogating to the lawfulnes of the ordination, then doeth the open and seene wickednes of a hyreling Minister impede the efficacie either of ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or the Sacraments ministred by him, in the faithfull receaver. And, if the equitie of this be so evident, alwayes, as, even in the state of a Church holding purity, al in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and, where, in that respect, the ordination of but one or fewe persons (who had beene thus ordained by an vnknowen, in the tyme, and, eftsoones detected Wolfe) might with lesse commotion or perill to the body of the Church, be annulled: albeit some men, in detestation of heresie, would vrge it, and, even the, so, ordained, also, (for the more clearing of themselves) should assent to the receaving of newe ordination: yet, if, even in such a case and condition of a Church, no necessitie could ever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force it vpon the conscience of any: howe much greater, yea and a divers consideration ought to be had, when the whole body of the Church, in common, being affected;
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:14704:48"/>
ordination is, in common, stained through all? most part, in common, being Wolves and Thieves, albeit not, as yet, in common, reputed so. For, as <hi>Augustin,</hi> wisely both wayeth and adviseth, a much different course and cure is to be taken and vsed, in a common evil, which hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone the whole body: then when, in a well constitute body (in common) but one or few particular members are affected. And, hereof, Christ, the true both Maister and mirrour of all Wisdome, in his owne practise, gave a cleare lesson. The Scribes &amp; Pharisees were, all, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, Wolves and Thieves: if perverters of the true sense of the law, and corrupters of all true both word and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe, by mixture of their leaven: if persecuters and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers of Prophets and of the Lord himselfe: if, who had losed the key of knowledge, and neither themselves en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred nor suffred others to enter in the Kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: if destroyers of soules, making their Disciples, doubly, the children of the Gehenna, may be counted Wolves and Thieves, and, yet, in consideration of their ordinary place in the Church (totally, in common, as then, affected) and, the reputation which they retained, notwithstanding with all, in common, of lawfull Pastours <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>e Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth to heare and obey them, in the tyme so farre, as, sitting in Moses his chaire, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap>ey should teach accordingly. from whom, notwithstanding, as from Murtherers and destroyers, he had resolved to transferre his vineyard and house. And, is, I praye you, the baire receaving of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ordination, from a man, of more importance, then is our totall submission to him, as to our Pastour, for the whole dispensation of grace to vs in the word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? and, if, in such a condition of a Church, wee not only may, but even are commanded to submit our selves so, as, in the tyme (till the Lord discover them and cast them out) we may take good of them, and eschew their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, in the whole outward ordinary dispensation of graces may not ordination also, in such a case, be lawfull? And may it not be taken also without contagion of the orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:14704:49"/>
his treasonable wickednes? and thus my generall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition also standeth true, that, even from a Wolfe or Thiefe vndetected, and, so retaining still the account of a lawfull Pastour, and outward place and power of ordination, &amp;c. lawfull outward ordination may properly and personally flowe. If your <hi>Elimas</hi> hath remarked me for more then this (I having ever, ioyned the restrict case so clearly) he hath wronged himselfe more then me for, if I had but put these wordes for all (<hi>seeing outward ordination serveth but for outwarde order</hi>) they might, with any honest hearted Reader, have freed me from all suspicion of so lourd an absurditie. For, what order can be imagined there, where knowne and advoued Haeretikes retaine any place or power in the Church? Nowe, Antichrist, in divers considerations is said to be hidde or covered: and, in divers considerations, to be revealed and detected. First, albeit hee was in the world (as in the seed and first beginnings of his hatching, while the mysterie of iniquitie was covertly begunne to worke) yet he was hidde and covered while light and the truth of the Gospell so prevailed, in common, as, errour was borne downe, and he did not aryse to any sensible height. And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>cordingly, he is said to be revealed, when, through prevailing darknes of the bottomles pitte, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a throne even in the Temple of God. And, even thus, againe (albeit, in a sort revealed) yet he is hidde and covered, so long, as, by his effectuall deceit and pretence of the Lambe his hornes (men not adverting the Dragon his mouth, or made yet wyse to count the number of his name) all, in common, doe still followe him, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der after him. and to bee revealed, againe, but that in two degrees (requiring a distinct and wyse consideration, and, which, most plainlie, in his story, are delivered by the spirit,) First, when, by the reviving light of the Gospell, men were brought to see great pollution both in manners and worshippe, and most part flowing from that execrable seat: wherevpon they were moved to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test, and even grievouslie to complaine of the obtaining
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:14704:49"/>
evils, and corruption of that seate in speciall. And, yet, this was so, as, his great place and proud pretence of Propheticall authoritie dazeled their weake eyes, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, from perceaving him clearly to bee, as a corrupt Bishop, so even the adversarie also and Antichrist and, therefore, scarce daring, yet to challenge him so, or to resolve separation from him: they vrged, only, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly, reformation of worshippe and manners, in sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie (poore honest soules) yet thinking, or not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither dispairing, but, that the pard could leave his spotts, and the Thiefe and Traitour would reforme: and not yet fully resolved that Babylon could not bee cured. And in this degree, (while not only the Churche in <hi>Perga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> but even in <hi>Thyatira,</hi> albeit waxing in good workes, yet tollerateth: yea even while that first of the three Angels fleeth and preacheth through the middes of heaven, Revelar. Chapter fourtheene, verse 8.) yet is hee not fully detected. But, when his impatiencie of any cure, and bloodie crueltie in murthering the Saintes (whereby the, earst, spotted Pard becommeth whollie of the Dragon his collour, and, where, firste, but the heade, nowe the whole bodie is full of the names of blasphemie) stirre men not onely to applie the rodde of examination, (whereby to trie, if, possiblie, so bloodie and blasphemous a bodie could bee the true Churche of God) but also, that, thereby, Cittie and Courte are clearelie, founde to bee cast out, when the revived Witnesses are called vp and visiblie separated from his contagious fellowshippe: when the seconde Angell Revelat. Chapter 14. plainlie denounceth Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylons fall, so, proclayming the Traitour: then was hee fullie revealed to bee a Thiefe and Wolfe, and, from that time foorth, no lawefull Ordination could either bee given by him or taken from him. As, thereupon, convenientlie, the thirde Angell Revelat. Chapter 14. verse 9. warneth, and, that, sadly, that none receave his marke.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:14704:50"/>
To reason, then, from Antichrist in the first degrees of the mysterie of iniquitie working towardes a height, to Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ inthroned in the Temple: or, from Antichrist sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and, by effectuall deceit obtaining in the Temple, to Antichrist revealed: or, from the first degree of detection, to him, now, publiklie, proclaimed a Traitour, and the true church separated fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his fellowship: or from ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, flowing from him in the one case, to ordinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from him on the other: it is deceaving, and yet but grosse sophistication. Now, if even thus, and, in the sense, which I have cleared to bee mine, your man yet hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked my position to bee erroneous. And, if hee holdeth that from no Wolfe or Thiefe of whatsoever qualitie or condition any lawfull ordination could ever properly &amp; personally be taken. Then you may tel my remarker, from me, that hee hath remarked that for an errour, which is so evident and stable a truth, as all, any where bearing the Beast his marke, shall never bee able to overthrow it. Though it should never so much grieve him, that thereby, his invincible argument is so vtterly overthrowen, as it, shall never any more find one foot to stand on.</p>
            <p>What your man his (<hi>REMARK</hi>) doth point at in this part of my words: [<hi>And he who receaveth outward ordination is not sworne or tyed to the will or appetit of his ordainer, more then any mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister baptizeth in his owne name, &amp;c.</hi>] For these wordes he draweth also, I could hardly, coniecture. To shew that the forsaking of the obedience, and deserting the fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe of ones ordainer (tryed a Traitour) taketh not away the deserters ordination: I vsed this argument. That, in our ordination, wee are consecrated, not to men, but to God. And to proove this, I brought the Apostel his reason of the common condition of all Christians. Whom, as Christ hath redeemed with his owne blood, and vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the liberty of the Sonnes of God, so, hath he thereby exemed them, in their spirituall state, from being servants to men. For we have but one Lord: and, we are, no more Paul his, nor Apollo his, nor Cepha his, but Christ his.

And accordingly, with the Apostle, I brought the vse and priviledge of our baptisme, the sacrament of our initation and entrie to that libertie in Christ: in whom only we are baptized, and, to whom only we are thereby consecrated, &amp; not to men. according to which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stant li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie of al Christians by baptisme, I did argue, that, so, in our ordination to any publike office in the church, we are consecrated to Christ and not to men: to be his servants, &amp; not the servants of men. Otherwayes, our ordin'atio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> should destroy the libertie of our baptisme: being baptized, first to Christ, &amp; being ordained, next to men. and so shuld Christ be robbed of his inheritance, so dearly purchased, &amp; we of our liberty also. Wherevpon, it doth clearly follow, that in deserting the minister of my ordination (beeing found a wolfe) and, so, cleaving stil to Christ, whose I am, I do not fal away from the prerogative of my calling. For, who did separat vs, Christ or the Pope? and to whose service were we separat, Christ his or the Popes? were we baptized the children of God; to be thereafter, ordained servants of the Pope? what doth your <hi>Elymas</hi> remarke here? or, because I but touched the argume't, in a word, thinking it enough in so plain a matter, to point at the place, hath therfore, a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour of divinitie, mistaken my meaning; whereof no sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible christian could misse the perceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? Or, doth this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps offend him; that, where in ordination, subiection was professed &amp; sworn to the Pope: yet I make the ordained to be no more sworn to the wil or appetit of the ordainer, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any minister baptizeth in his owne name? But, I was not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paring the rituall action or outward forme of baptisme with that of ordination. But (with the Apostle) fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty obtained &amp; sealed vp to vs in baptisme, pleading the same in ordination also: the outward ministerie whereof maketh me no more servant to him who is minister there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to me, then I was baptized in the name of the minister, but of the Lord. next, it is childish fallacie to reason fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the oath of subiection given to our ordainers in the matter of outward policy &amp; governeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; for keeping dece<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t order
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:14704:51"/>
in the house of God: to our spirituall servitude and subie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of our consciences to the will and appetite of men. I let goe, that it is a fallacie also to reason from the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and subiection to him, to the minister of our ordinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who is not alwayes the ordained his ordinarie. In our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches, we give our oath of subiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to our or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaries: for, wee know that the house of God is not the house of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fusion, but of order: and that the spirits of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, are subiect to Prophets. but, doth this mancipate ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vs or our ministrie to their will or appetit? Thirdlie, I would aske, if your ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thinketh it all one thing to swear subiection to the Pope; and to be sworne or tied to his wil and appetit? I aske fourthly, if that oath of subiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the Pope was essentiall to lawfull ordination; or, but accesso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie? if essentiall, then for many hundreths of yeres in al the Church, almost, there was no lawfull ordination. yea, and the Pope him selfe could have no lawful ordination who can not, neither doeth sweare subiection to him selfe. and, if it be not essentiall, but accessorie, then may both ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation consist without it, &amp; the loosing of it annulleth not the substance of ordinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and the man, who holdeth or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination to be a sacrament (whose common nature is to have relation to the graces of God only, sealed vp or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to vs therby: and to serve for notes of our professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of these dueties we owe againe immediatly to God) he should know this also, that by making any oath, in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, given to man, to be an essentiall part thereof, hee maketh that man to be God, and that to bee his sacrament &amp; not the Lord his. finallie, I demand whither the oath be given, first, properlie, and principally, to the Pope: or, first, properly, and principally, to Christ? And, whither it be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Pope, absolutly, or but in Christ, as to his vicar and minister? If first, properly, and principally, to Christ, &amp; to Christ only, absolutlie: and to the Pope but secundari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and in Christ (as I hope none dare deny: except they would, in plain termes, avouch this Pope to be that adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie exalting himself as God above al that is called God,

            <p>I have bene the larger in this matter remarked by your man perceaving his chiefe endeavour bended against me there. whither he hath esteemed me, in that part, weakest: or if he hath felt himself assailed, there in the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dation of his strength: the peril of his invincible argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t pricking him. for, except vpon the 6.7. &amp; 8. sections of my treatise, he neither vttereth any word, nor giveth any other signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of his meaning throw al, but that vpon the 28. se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, he setteth this signe ?. &amp; that so sensibly as any may well perceave he was careful it should be seene, for shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therewith my defect also signed thereby: &amp; according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie I stirred my owne minde to find out what so notable a slippe that could bee, which hee had so singularly no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. But in my dulnes could see nothing, except that there perhaps he thought some occasion might be catched to calumniat, or that there, was ministred to him some matter of mirding.

My wordes to which his signe looketh, are these: <hi>for myne owne part, as in all sobernes and cleannes of heart, by the gift of GOD I have bene carefull to know the truth. So, was I never much curious to inquire of the particular state of our first mens callings.

When their pamphlet against our callings, which stirred me to defence, was put abroad: it was backed by the applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders thereof, with insolent braggs that no answere either would or could possibly be given it: &amp;, that, though twenty answers were made thereto, yet they should all be refelled with als many sound replyes. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon, at the intreaty of some well affected brethren (least the hearts of our weake ones should be dismayed) I was mooved to writ my treatise of defence: whereof a copy falling in the adversarie his handes (and that without my knowledge and against my purpose, who, hating conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, framed my paines onely for resolution of modest minds) I heard divers and daylie surmises from them, that my treatise would be in short tyme solidly refuted. And, I, accordingly, more exspecting what a traveling moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine would bring foorth, then mynding any reply ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: at last my copy returned to me carying such notes of a censuring penne as occasioned my epistle to a recusant.

            <p>SEeing the Ministers of <hi>Scotland</hi> graunts the church of <hi>Rome</hi> to have been once the true Church of Christ, wee desire them to thew in what yeare of God shee made first defection from the true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and by whom shee was condemned for heresie. Likewayes, wee desire to know the names of these who since the Church of Rome fell from the trueth, hes continually from time to time, and age to age pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed this religion in all substantiall pointes of doctrine as they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently professe, whose doctrine and writings in all pointes of religion, they will advow and byde by.</p>
            <p>NOw consider (good Reader) what either pitifull ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, or rather poysonable perversnes of an inpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently evill conscience these demaundes bewray most e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videntlie. Our disputation was about the lawfulnes, or vnlawfulnes of our Pastorall callings. This they by their treatise laboured to evince: I by my defence pleaded the other. In this our litis-contestation, partly by dumbe, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie by speaking signes and draughtes set by them on the margent, or drawen betwixt the lines of my booke, they sought, at first, that it might seeme they had somewhat to say against me. Therevpon, in my epistle to a Recusant, I sustained my point. Now, in steed of replying ought, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for confirming their owne, or impugning my part of our debated matter, the question is, (whither impudently or ignorantly) altered: and, from the institut point of our vocation, like slipperie Iles, they slyde backe to new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundes of our doctrine. Is this, I pray you, to dispute, or to dallie? Are these the fresh fyrie edged schoolmen ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived lately, and with so great exspectation of working wonders, from <hi>Paris, Lovan, Rhems,</hi> &amp; <hi>Rome</hi>; shaping, shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,

and slopping men through with syllogismes; who neither, can propoune ought, or sustaine to heare any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere but in <hi>forma &amp; figura</hi>; that nowe they forget not only all forme and figure; but therewith, all both mense and sense also, in so shamelesly shifting the question, &amp; casting in, kowardly, a kard of another kynd? why remembred they not their owne offer so often and confidently made vs by worde, write and printe; that if we could but once cleare the lawfulnes of our callings, they would, without more adoe or furder disputation about heads of doctrine, give vs their handes? For our vocation I have said some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what against their obiections in my Treatise of defence. and, againe, in my epistle to a recusant, I have replyed to their censuring notes. If I have cleared the point, why re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member they not their covenant? If I have not, yet why, in place of refelling my argumentes and strengthening their owne point, am I deceitfully drawen away from the question in hand; by newe and impertinent demands of a different matter? and yet if in this their shameles shifting, there were, in them, any one spunke of sinceritie, I could even gladly bee drawen to follow them. for that, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, it is a much more sure way from truth of doctrine to establish lawefulnes of vocation, then, vpon the slipperie ground of outward ordinary calling, to build a warrant of doctrine.</p>
            <p>But consider, I pray you, first, the ingenuitie of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunder, in the substance of his demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds: and, next his aequitablenes, in his prescribed rules. wee are desired (in summe) to evince that the Church of Rome hath made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postasie from the truth: and, therewith, to cleare that our doctrine is the veritie of God. But, (shameles men) what have we bene doing, these more then a hundreth yeares agoe, but filling the world with volumes; whereby wee have so plainly discovered their abhominations, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified the truth of our Doctrine; as wearied with conte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting therabout, or rather vexed with their cleare convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing power of light, they were faine to cast vp all either

disputation, &amp; come in end as to their last refuge, to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell our vocation? the lawfulnes whereof, when, thervpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we have stablished against al their cavillations, they leape now back, &amp; of new again intend accusation against our doctrine. what is this else, but (as children, in their spor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, childishly practise and more childishly speak) to play titbore tatbore with vs?</p>
            <p>Now, as he hath forgotten all shame in so childish shif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the question, so, by his limitations laid down to vs (I know not by what law) how to answer him in both the points demanded, he exponeth plainly to the perception of any sensible Reader, what sound mind he hath &amp; what aequitablenes is in his dealing with vs. First, for evincing the apostasie of the church of <hi>Rome,</hi> we must take this law of the demander: that in so farre as the <hi>Church of Rome was once the true Church of Christ,</hi> we must, therefore, condescend <hi>what yeare of God shee made first defection, and by whom</hi> (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly) <hi>shee was condemned of Haeresie.</hi> Reasonable men, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. And yet their companions in spirit,<note place="margin">

            <p>But, heerein, first, I can not but greatly muze, whither foolishlie or fraudfullie the demander hath fallen vpon so either an improper or so presumptuous a maner of speach, as, indefinitlie and absolutlie, to call the Church of Rome <hi>the true Church of Christ.</hi> that, consequently, all other chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches may either bee secluded from this title, or bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to come in vnder the name of the church of Rome.

Our adversaries, in this their demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d are no lesse ridiculous, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were either a senseles foole, or a perverse iangler, who, the sunne arysing bright in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:14704:60"/>
yet because, soone after, it is by degrees so lapped vp in clouddes and mist as it is not seene of men in the earth, till that; some houres before even, breaking out again clearly, &amp; dispelling all that overshadowing darknes, it lighten of new the earth, would, therefore, with pertinacie plead that the sunne thus wrestling out from vnder that overvailing cloud, were not the true sunne which in the morning had shyned, but some counterfait and never before seene Comet: because, foresooth, their eies had not all the minuts of the day sensibly seene the shyning body and particular progres of it. But, poor Idiots, the sunne hath such a soveraine and singular both light and heat, as, though all the dolts in the worlde would disclaime it, yet wil evince it, to be alwayes one and the same:<note place="margin">

            <p>In my treatise of defence and 19. section thereof, answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this same obiection, I alledged, that as divers of our men had done, so I might bring faire Catalogues of men who in former ages had holden the truth &amp; heavely lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the prevayling corruptions of their tymes. But I gave, there, divers and good reasons why neither ought that iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bee required of vs, neither we bee so foolish as to divert with our adversaries to so vnnecessary an altercation. And, long before, in my commentarie vpon the 14. Chap. of the Revelation, I shewed, how, to answer the adversarie ought hereto, were but vainly to hale the coard of contention with men whose mouthes wee might stoppe by more sure and evident arguments. And yet the adversarie (in a good conscience I warrant you, of a iust cause) will admit, now, no rule whereby to examine vs, but which hee knew verie well that, before any demande from him, I had, for good reasons, reiected: and he is so extreemly impudent heerein, as not onely without refelling any of my reasons, he still vrgeth it: but fearing also what herein I might verie well performe if I pleased to answer a foole to his follie, and so
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:14704:61"/>
proove a foole with him: that, wherto I refused to answere, being proponed eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in a large case, he reponeth to me now with such strict limitations, as any sensible Reader may e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently perceave, he hath fore-caston his evasions how to escape taking. And for this it is that, forsooth, we must show who fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> age to age not onley held, but also <hi>professed</hi> the same Religion, and that in all substantiall points. And whose writinges, in all <hi>points</hi> wee will advow and byde at. Heere, hee hath prepared to him selfe exceptions against any whom hee thinketh that, in those most corrupted times, wee can produce against him. First, if hee hath not open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie avowed and professed: next, if hee hath not professed all the substantiall points which wee holde. Thirdly, if we advow not and byde at al whatsoever they have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in all and any point of Religion. Sweet, indeed, and sounde hearted disputers. By this law laide downe to vs by these aequitable men, not only shall they serve vs for no witnesses who through ignorance or infirmitie, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon errour in the tyme have impinged, perhaps, in some points, but even their silence or want of a remaining re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord behinde them, in anie one point professed by vs, shall get them casten. But (which before I have shewed) as all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills did not arise at once, neither, at firste to such degree as where fore men would be soone caried to open contestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: so (albeit in a common vse and prevayling practise, yet before any tyrannicall yoake was imposed on consciences, by inforcing lawes) while a libertie was left to men of hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them selves pure, and keeping the name of GOD, they were loath, with evident hazard, to contende against evill so subtillie insinuated, and by pretence of Propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call authoritie, so arrogantly advaunced. A weaknes, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, in them, but such as the holy Ghost hath clearely fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolde vs should befall even his true and faithfull Church, dwelling where Sathan his throne was. And, which, the more the mysterie of iniquitie wrought on, was the lesse wonderfull: in regarde of the tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nicall vsurpation, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by no libertie was left (without certaine peril) of anie open opposition; or, if, of open profession, yet not of publishing
