         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN Anſwer to your laſt, wherein you deſire me to give a Character of our Prince, I ſhall, as well as I can, ſatisfie you.</p>
            <p>As for his <hi>outward Accompliſhments,</hi> I ſuppoſe you expect not that I ſhould ſay any thing, you ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſeen him frequently when he was in <hi>England,</hi> and been a Witneſs of his excellent, noble, and Princely Deportment.</p>
            <p>Nor is it neceſſary to one of your Education and Learning, to have an Account of his <hi>Anceſtors,</hi> or that you be told, that he is the principal Branch of a Houſe famous in Hiſtory for theſe many hundreds of years, and that his Veins flow, with the nobleſt Blood in the World. However accidental theſe Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges are, yet Heaven was not pleaſed they ſhould be wanting to a Perſonage it had conſummated to be the Relief and Support of Chriſtendom, and the Delight of Mankind.</p>
            <p>But 'tis his <hi>Mind,</hi> I know, of which you require a Character; and of that though 'twill be impoſſible for me to do him Juſtice, yet I will endeavour to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form you. He is, firſt, a Prince of exemplary <hi>Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> and <hi>Sobriety,</hi> and this not becauſe his Body can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bear Exceſſes, his robuſt and healthy Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on manifeſting the contrary; but from the ſtrong Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion the Beauty of theſe Virtues had early made and ſtill continue upon his excellent Soul. Nor are they without their Companions, <hi>Modeſty</hi> and <hi>Chaſtity,</hi> which few of bulkier Title do at all regard, and theſe practiſed to that height, that his Court is eſteem'd an Academy of good Manners, and his Courtiers, by his Example, as ſo many Profeſſors of Ethics. Beſide theſe, his benign Temper, his readineſs to forgive Injuries, his tenacious Memory of Services done, and his incomparable Prudence, conſider'd in oppoſition to the haughty Carriage, the implacable and cruel Reſentments, the horrid Ingratitude, and the dull Unadviſedneſs of ſome of his Cotemporaries of the higher Style, render him ſtill a fit Subject for the Love and Well-wiſhes of every honeſt and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man.</p>
            <p>And yet, that which adds ſtill to the luſtre of this fair train of Virtues, and which ſeems to have the fulleſt poſſeſſion of him, is JUSTICE, not that he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects to be flatter'd with the Title of <hi>Juſt,</hi> as has been done by thoſe who leaſt deſerv'd it, and who never practiſed it, except it were to ſerve ſome turn, and to preamble a Trepan; or to avoid ſome impending danger by a ſpecious ſhew of Reſtitution and Repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but he has made it the peculiar embelliſhment of all the Actions of his Life. Hence it was, that upon all the Succeſſes with which his Arms and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct have been bleſt, he never was puff'd up into a deſire of having any addition ſo much as to his Title, not one City or Town in the Netherlands can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of any Infraction upon their Immunities, or any Raviſhing of their ancient Privileges, So that though it has frequently been in his power to have aggran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diz'd himſelf, after the example of his ill Neighbors, (ſome of whoſe curſed Paraſites have yet had the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence to tranſcribe their Maſters Follies of this fort into his Hiſtory, as if he had been guilty of the like) yet he always ſacrific'd to Juſtice whatſoever Advantages his good Fortune put into his hands, and ſcorn'd to be great at the coſt his Country; which from the low State wherein he found it when he was firſt ſet at the Head of the Commonwealth, deem'd then by one of our beſt Politicians to have been upon the point of irrecoverable Declenſion, he has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſerted into ſo conſiderable a condition, that they ſeem able to redeem themſelves from a Debt of a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years ſtanding to our own Nation. This He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roical Principle it is, that has ſet him ſo high above his neighbouring Contenders for GLORY, as vile Flatterers call it, which is to be acquir'd by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>populating of Countries, ſtripping Cities and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of their Rights and Privileges, and the enſlaving and unmanning a great part of Mankind. This Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of <hi>Glory</hi> (other than what is raiſed upon an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and juſt Foundation) has in him ennobled the preſent Age with an Example for all ſucceeding Potentates in the World, by obſerving of which, they may avoid thoſe Exorbitances which have made the fooliſh Affecters of Glory ſtink in Chronicle, and inſtead of atchieving, forſooth, immortal Honour, have cauſed their Names to be rang'd only in the higher Claſs of Robbers and Trouble-worlds: for he, unlike to them, ſeems to have made it the <hi>truly Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious</hi> Deſign of his Life to ſet Mankind at Liberty; and he began early, when having ſcarce reach'd Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, he reſcu'd his Country out of the Jaws of a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid Tyger, or which is all one, a Popiſh Victor, who would have introduc'd upon her that ſlavery of Body and Soul which ever follows the ſucceſsful Arms of a bigotted Idolatrous Conqueror: And, if mens Sins hinder not, and their ſelves be not wanting, why may they not hope to ſee this wondrous Bleſſing by Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence more diffuſive, and not concluded within the narrow Boundaries of <hi>Belgium.</hi> The <hi>Theban</hi> Hero, not content to have aſſerted his Cradle, vindicated alſo the Nations round about; for beholding on one ſide a Tyrant over-running and deſtroying all, to that degree, that he was fabled to feed his Horſes with Mans Fleſh; and on t'other ſide the Sea, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with like Title, Prieſt-ridden into the moſt abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable and inhuman Idolatry; he thought 'twas the Duty of a good man, though he were not a Party concern'd, (which is ſillily urg'd againſt our living Hero) to take up the Cauſe of Humanity, and to pull 'em down. It ſucceeded well; for he ſoon brought 'em both to Reaſon, and the grateful Pagans voted him a place among their Gods. And indeed they argu'd rightly, conſidering their want of, Divine Light; for what could they ſuppoſe to be liker God than he that for no advantage to himſelf, confer'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them the moſt valuable Good in the World, even LIBERTY.</p>
            <p>A Branch of this Virtue of <hi>Juſtice</hi> he deems to be <hi>Moderation</hi> towards men of <hi>another Religion;</hi> and by this alſo he has always contradiſtinguiſh'd himſelf from his more dignified Brethren of the Elbow-Seat; for this he not only profeſs'd but practiſed always. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was he known to be the undoing of a Family, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Father of it could not be of his Mind. No man with him is Factious, or a Sectary, but he that troubles the Public Tranquillity. In the Diſpoſal of his Rewards and Favours, regard is only had to the <hi>Honeſteſt Man.</hi> Not but that he is well aware, that there is a Sect of Men in the World, who, be they never ſo generouſly principled by Nature, yet-their Religion (as they call it) obliging them to an implicit belief of and obedience to Perſons of wicked Deſigns, he allows them with ſome diſcrimination a ſhare in his Protection, but truſts them with great difficulty.</p>
            <p>I ſhould now tell you ſomewhat of his <hi>Valour;</hi> but it is of a ſort, more ſublime than has yet appear'd in the World, and far above my Pen. The Vigour, the Conduct, the Greatneſs, and the Evenneſs of his Mind, the ſteady Menage, the Reſolution and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Danger, which are either Ingredients to it, or complicated with it, are as inimitable as not to be deſcribed. In fine, We have great reaſon to pray, That the Hand which has ſo exactly form'd and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd this Prince for the Support and Joy of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, would protect and aſſiſt him in bringing about thoſe noble Deſigns for the Common Good which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs than a Divine Spirit prompts him to. Our Friend at <hi>Soeſtdyhe</hi> is pretty well again.</p>
