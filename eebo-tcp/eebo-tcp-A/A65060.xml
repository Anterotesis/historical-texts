            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>WHAT cloying meat is Love, â€” when Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony's the Sauce to it. Two years Marriage has debaucht my five Senses. Every thing I see, every thing I hear, every thing I feel, every thing I smell, and every thing I tasteâ€”methinks has Wife in't.</p>
               <p>No Boy was ever so weary of his Tutor; no Girl of her Bib; no Nun of doing Penance nor Old Maid of being Chast, as I am of being Married.</p>
               <p>Sure there's a secret Curse entail'd upon the very Name of Wife. My Lady is a young Lady, a fine Lady, a Witty Lady, a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Lady â€” and yet I hate her. There is but one thing on Earth I loath beyond her: That's fighting. Wou'd my Courage come up but to a fourth part of my Ill Nature, I'd stand buff to her Relations, and thrust her out of Doors.</p>
               <p>But Marriage has sunk me down to such an Ebb of Resolution, I dare not draw my Sword, tho even to get rid of my Wife. But here she comes.</p>

But some comfort still; if one wou'd be reveng<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62484:6"/>
he's a Fool for't: For hitherto he has been no Monster: But who knows how far he may provoke me. I never lov'd him, yet I have been ever true to him; and that, in spight of all the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks of Art and Nature upon a poor weak Womans heart, in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of a Tempting Lover.</p>
               <p>Methinks so Noble a Defence as I have made, shou'd be reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a better usage â€” Or who can tell â€” Perhaps a good part of what I suffer from my Husband may be a Judgment upon me for my cruelty to my Lover.â€”Lord with what pleasure cou'd I indulge that thought, were there but a possibility of finding Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to make it good. And how do I know but there may â€” Let me see â€” What opposes? â€” My Matrimonial Vow? â€” Why, what did I Vow: I think I promis'd to be true to my Husband.</p>
               <p>Well; and he promis'd to be kind to me.</p>
               <p>But he han't kept his Word â€”</p>
               <p>Why then I'm absolv'd from mineâ€”ay, that seems clear to me. The Arguments good between the King and the People, why not between the Husband and the Wife? O, but that Condition was not exprest.â€”No matter, 'twas understood.</p>
               <p>Well, by all I see, If I argue the matter a little longer with my self, I shan't find so many Bug-bears in the way, as I thought I shou'd. Lord what fine notions of Virtue do we Women take up upon the Credit of old foolish Philosophers. Virtue's it's own reward, Virtue's this, Virtue's that; â€”Virtue's an Ass, and a Gallant's worth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty on't.</p>

'Tis true, Coquettry is one of the main ingredients in the natural Composition of a Woman, and I as well as others, cou'd be well enough pleas'd to see a Crowd of young Fellows, Ogling and Glancing and Watching all occasions to do forty foolish officious things: nay shou'd some of 'em push on, even to Hanging or Drowning: Why â€” Faithâ€” if I shou'd let pure Woman alone, I shou'd e'en be but too well pleas'd with't.</p>

I beg you will believe I did but rally, Madam, I know you judge too well of Right and Wrong, to be deceiv'd by Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments like those. I hope you'll have so favourable an opinion of my Understanding too, to believe the thing call'd Virtue has worth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough with me, to pass for an eternal Obligation where're 'tis sacrific'd.</p>

               <p>It do's. Constancy's a Brave, free, haughty, generous A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, that cannot buckle to the Chains of Wedlock.

               <p>And I too, I own it. Both how to speak my self, and how to look when others speak; But my Glass and I cou'd never yet agree what Face I shou'd make, when they come blurt out, with a nasty thing in a Play: For all the Men presently look upon the Women, that's certain; so laugh we must not, though our Stays burst for't, Because that's telling Truth, and owning we understand the Jest. And to look serious is so dull, when the whole House is a laughing.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Lady B.</speaker>
               <p>Besides, that looking serious, do's really betray our Knowledge in the Matter, as much as laughing with the Company wou'd do. For if we did not understand the thing, we shou'd natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally do like other People.</p>

               <p>O, no: Nor indeed hardly, let us do what we will. They most of 'em think, there is no such thing as Virtue consider'd in the strictest notions of it: And therefore when you hear 'em say, Such a one is a Woman of Reputation, They only mean she's a Woman of Discretion. For they consider, we have no more Religion than they have, nor so much Morality; and between you and I, <hi>Bellinda,</hi> I'm afraid the want of Inclination seldom protects any of us.</p>

               <p>I think that never kept any Woman virtuous long. We are not such Cowards neither. No: Let us once pass Fifteen, and we have too good an Opinion of our own Cunning, to believe the World can penetrate, into what we wou'd keep a Secret.

            <sp>
               <speaker>Heart.</speaker>
               <p>A Challenge. I know the Knight too well for that. His dear Body will always prevail upon his noble Soul to be quiet.</p>

               <p>Not if you whisper him in the Ear, you won't have him do't, and there's no other way left that I see.

                        <p>The Accident that has happen'd has touch'd our Invention to the quick. We wou'd fain come off, without your help; but find that's impossible. In a word, the whole Business must be thrown upon a Matrimonial Intrigue, between your Friend

and mine. But if the Parties are not fond enough, to go quite through with the Matter; 'tis sufficient for our turn, they own the Design. We'll find Pretences enough, to break the Match. <hi>Adieu.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Heart.</speaker>
               <p>And yet, I think, I may reasonably be allow'd to boggle at marrying the Neice, in the very Moment that you are a debauching the Aunt.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Const.</speaker>
               <p>Why truly, there may be something in that. But have not you a good Opinion enough of your own Parts, to believe you cou'd keep a Wife to your self?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Heart.</speaker>
               <p>I shou'd have, if I had a good Opinion enough of hers, to believe she cou'd do as much by me. For to do 'em Right, after all, the Wife seldom rambles, till the Husband shews her the way.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Const.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis true; a Man of real Worth, scarce ever is a Cuckold, but by his own Fault<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Women are not naturally lewd, there must be something to urge 'em to it. They'll cuckold a Churle, out of Revenge; A Fool, because they despise him; a Beast because they loath him.

                  </gap>d play my Lady. But our Weakness, thou know'st, my Friend, consists in that very Change, we so impudently throw upon (indeed) a steadier and more generous Sex.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Const.</speaker>
               <p>Why Faith we are a little Impudent in that Matter that's the Truth on't. But this is wonderful, to see you grown so warm an Advocate for those (but t'other Day) you took so much pains to abuse.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Heart.</speaker>
               <p>All Revolutions run into Extreams, the Bigot makes the boldest Atheist; and the coyest Saint, the most extravagant Strumpet. But Prithee advise me in this good and Evil; this Life and Death, this Blessing and Cursing, that is set before me. Shall I marry â€” or die a Maid?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Const.</speaker>
               <p>Why Faith, <hi>Heartfree,</hi> Matrimony is like an Army going to engage. Love's the forlorn Hope, which is soon cut off; the Marriage-Knot is the main Body, which may stand Buff a long long time; and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:62484:41"/>
Repentance is the Rear-Guard, which rarely gives ground, as long as the main Battle has a Being.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Heart.</speaker>
               <p>Conclusion then; you advise me to whore on, as you do.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Const.</speaker>
               <p>That's not concluded yet. For tho' Marriage be a Lottery in which there are a wondrous many Blanks; yet there is one inestimable Lot, in which the only Heaven on Earth is written. Wou'd your kind Fate but guide your Hand to that, though I were wrapt in all that Luxury it self cou'd cloath me with, I still shou'd envy you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Heart.</speaker>
               <p>And justly too: For to be capable of loving one, doubtless is better than to possess a Thousand. But how far that Capacity's in me, alas I know not.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Const.</speaker>
               <p>But you wou'd know?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Heart.</speaker>
               <p>I wou'd so.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Const.</speaker>
               <p>Matrimony will inform you.</p>
               <p>Come, one Flight of Resolution carries you to the Land of Experience; where, in a very moderate time, you'll know the Capacity of your Soul, and your Body both, or I'm mistaken.
