            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the yeer 1607. divers preceding diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries
having confirmed an Opinion,
That the Country of <hi>Virginia</hi> was fit
for Plantation; It pleaſed God to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
the mindes of very many worthily
diſpoſed Noblemen, Gentlemen, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to conceive it as a matter of great
Religion and Honour, to undertake the
work of perfecting a Chriſtian Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in thoſe parts. Whereupon King <hi>James</hi> was pleaſed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the firſt Founder of this noble work, and by his Letters
Patents from time to time renewed and enlarged, granted all am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
Priviledges and Immunities, both to thoſe that managed in
<hi>England,</hi> &amp; thoſe that went to inhabit there: which gave ſo great
an encouragement, that fifty Earls and Barons, three hundred
and fifty Knights, and ſix hundred Gentlemen, and Merchants
of primeſt rank<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> became incoporated, and were originally named
in the Letters Patents by the name of the Company of <hi>Virginia,</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:54611:3"/>
being a greater union of Nobles and Commons, then ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred
to ſuch an undertaking. But nevertheleſs, partly by the
natural difficulties incident to all new Plantations; but chiefly,
through the unnatural and faulty impediments ariſing by the
croſs agitations of two powerful factions in the Company, the
work went heavily on for the firſt twelve yeers, appearing deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
in the ſeveral ill ſucceſſes thereof. And though afterward
ſomewhat advanced and proſperous, yet in the yeer 1621. by
the fatal blow of a Maſſacre, it was almoſt ſhattered to pieces,
and brought to a very low and calamitous condition; which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
the contrary faction preſently took hold of, inſomuch that
they exceedingly ſlighted the action, and cared not to caſt aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
on the Country, and on the whole management of that
affair. And then further ſtrongly poſſeſſed and adviſed the then
King, againſt the form of the Companies Government, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
of an exceſſive number of Councellours, and a confuſed
Popularity, as being a Nurſe of Parliamentary ſpirits, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious
to Monarchical Government. Thereupon Order was
made upon the eighth day of <hi>October,</hi> 1623. at the Council-Table,
whereby the Company were moved to give in their aſſents
for ſurrendeing their Patent, and altering their form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and a new one propoſed, wherein the Intereſts and Rights
of all men ſhould be preſerved: which Order the Company not
ſubmitting unto, A <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> was directed for the calling
in of their Patent, and an advantage taken upon their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleading.
The Patent was condemned in <hi>Trinity</hi>-Term fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing:
but for many years after, not vacated upon the Record
in the Office of the <hi>Rolls,</hi> whereby ſome that ſought the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
of the Lord <hi>Baltamore</hi>'s Patent for <hi>Maryland,</hi> in the
beginning of the Parliament, 1640. took out the <hi>Virginia</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
again under the broad Seal of <hi>England:</hi> therefore thought
by primeſt Lawyers now to be unqueſtionably in force, at leaſt to
point of intereſt; and that Patent of <hi>Maryland</hi> unconſiſtent
and void.</p>
            <p>Thus in brief was the late Company diſſolved, and a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
given to divers Lords and others, for preſent directing and
ordering the affairs of <hi>Virginia;</hi> and that they ſhould adviſe
touching a better form of Government for advancing and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54611:3"/>
the Colony. Then iſſued alſo ſeveral Proclamations, and
ſeveral Orders from the Council-Table, with great aſſurances un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Broad Seal &amp; privy Seal, that all men, with the Adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
and Planters, ſhould be aſſured, that their Rights and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts
ſhould be conſerved and enlarged, onely alteration in
point of Government. But both that Commiſſion and renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Companies Charter expired, and all thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
were delayed, by reaſon of the death of King <hi>James,</hi>
which then ſuddenly enſued. The principal ſcope of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
was, that they ſhould finde a better form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for the Countryes advancement, and therein was eſpecially
promiſed the conſervation of every man's right; intentions wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
the wiſdom and juſtice of ſo great a Prince. But nothing was
done by thoſe Commiſſioners touching either of thoſe ends, nor
by thoſe by whoſe proſecutions theſe things hapned, who having
attained their private ends of ſpleen and profit upon the changes
and revolutions of enſuing times<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> deſerted the intereſt of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony,
and left her weltring in her blood, unſupplied with Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
and Arms in the heat of a difficult war with the Indians:
the burthen and charge whereof was onely undergone by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
Planters, who thus forſaken by their former friends,
were conſtrained both to work and fight for their lives and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance;
and thereby preſerved the Colony from deſertion,
and at laſt reſtored it by the bleſſing of God to peace and
plenty.</p>
            <p>And then, about the yeer 1633. Lord <hi>Baltamore</hi> pretending<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
though not truely, the greateſt part of the Country was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted,
procured that the aforeſaid judgement ſo long delayed,
was entred, and obtained a Patent, for that part now called
<hi>Maryland,</hi> which he hath ſince held with a few people and ſmall
Adventurers, bebarring of thoſe to whom it belonged from
planting of it; deſtroying and ruinating thoſe formerly ſeated
under <hi>Virginia,</hi> at the Iſle of <hi>Kent;</hi> and interdicting Trade
with the Indians for Furs, diſcovered and begun by the Virgini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
by direction and commiſſion from the King; which ſince by
this means is enjoyed by the Dutch and Swedes, with the profit
of many thouſand pounds yeerly; which Trade had been ſolely
in the Engliſh Nations hands, had not the Lord <hi>Baltamore</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdicted

And thoſe Swedes and Dutch do trade for great quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

Voce,</hi> and that former Act of Councel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their Lordſhips were
pleaſed by an Order of the twentieth of <hi>October,</hi> 1623. to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
again, that there was no other intention, but onely and
meerly in reforming and change of the preſent Government; and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54611:5"/>
that no man ſhould receive any prejudice, but have his Eſtate
fully and wholly confirmed; and if in any thing defective, better
to be ſecured; which Order was ſent over by their Lordſhips
command, and publiſhed in <hi>Virginia</hi> for encouragement of the
Planter.</p>
               <p>3. King <hi>James</hi> was alſo pleaſed to expreſs the ſame in his
Commiſſion to ſundry of his own privy Councel, and other
Commiſſioners for the time being, for the affairs of <hi>Virginia,
July</hi> 5. 1624. that his intention was to alter the Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>ents,
as to the form of Government; but with the preſervation of
the Intereſt of every Adventurer and Planter.</p>
               <p>4. The like Declaration of the King's intentions was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt
in the Commiſſion then ſent to Sir <hi>Francis Wiat,</hi> and the
Councel then appointed by his Majeſty, to direct the Affairs
and People in <hi>Virginia;</hi> and the like hath been inſerted in all
King <hi>Charles</hi> his Commiſſions, and of all the Governours
of <hi>Virginia,</hi> that have been ſince that time to this preſent.</p>
               <p>5. The ſaid King <hi>Charles</hi> by his Proclamation, <hi>May</hi> 13.
1625. declared, That <hi>his aim was onely to reduce the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
into ſuch a right courſe, as might beſt agree with
the form held in the reſt of his Monarchy, and not intended
to impeach the intereſt of any Adventurer or Planter in</hi> Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia.</p>
               <p>6. The Lords of the Councel by their Letter dated the 24 of
<hi>October,</hi> 1625. declare to the <hi>Colony,</hi> That <hi>the Kings pleaſure
was to preſerve every man's particular right, and the Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to enjoy their former priviledges;</hi> with addition of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
requiſite immunities; encouraging alſo the Planter to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries
both by Sea and Land; and to perfect the Trade of Furs:
which Letter, according to their Lordſhips command, was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
in <hi>Virginia.</hi> But Captain <hi>Cleyborn</hi> who was thereupon
imployed by Commiſſion from the Governour, under the
King's Broad Seal, and the Seal of the Colony, and then diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
thoſe parts of the Trade of <hi>Maryland,</hi> was thereby
utterly undone, ſupplanted and expelled by the Lord <hi>Balta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7. The King alſo, for the encouragement of the Planters, by
his Royal Letters the 12 of <hi>September,</hi> 1628. was pleaſed to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54611:5"/>
promiſe thereby to renew and confirm unto the Colony under
the great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> their Lands and Priviledges formerly
granted to them.</p>
               <p>8. And when the generall Aſſembly, conſiſting of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
Councel, and Burgeſſes of the whole Colony complained
to the Lords of the Councel, of the interruption of their Trade
by the Lord <hi>Baltamore</hi>'s Deputies their Lordſhips were pleaſed
by their Letter <hi>July</hi> 22. 1634. to ſignifie that the Plantation
of <hi>Virginia</hi> ſhould enjoy their Eſtates and Trade, with the
ſame freedom and priviledge as they did before the recalling of
their Patent.</p>
               <p>By all which it appears, that howſoever the Government could
not be reduced from that popular form of the Company in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
but by revocation of the Patent it ſelf; yet in reſpect
of both thoſe Kings Declarations, and the Lords Orders, the
Adventurers and Planters of <hi>Virginia,</hi> as to their Rights and
Priviledges, according to the Rule of Equity, remain in the
ſame condition, as if no ſuch Judgement had been given.</p>
               <p>Object. But they anſwer hereunto to this effect, though not
truely neither, That <hi>the Lord</hi> Baltamore <hi>his Patent takes in
no part, that the</hi> Virginians <hi>had then planted, and ſo the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts
of all men is preſerved; and, that</hi> Maryland <hi>is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
then a particular Plantation, as the Company uſed to
grant to divers Adventurers and Planters; and, that
the King might do as much as the Company while they
ſtood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. We reply, That the Adventurers and Planters
were encouraged to expend their Eſtates, in ſo vaſt a proportion,
and to hazard their lives in all extremities, alwayes accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
new deſigns and beginnings, in hope, that their ſhares upon
the diviſion of Lands, being four hundred Miles along the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore,
and into the Land from Sea to Sea, would recompence
them and their Heirs, as in <hi>Ireland,</hi> heretofore, and now is done.
But this Intereſt by the Patent of the Lord <hi>Baltamore</hi>'s com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending
neer two degrees, which is an hundred and twenty
Miles, is wholly taken from them, and ſcarce is there
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54611:6"/>
any room for any Adventurers to take up any Land due unto
them.</p>
               <p>It is truely anſwered, that all the Adventurers of the Company
were Tenants in common to all the Land, which was not actually
divided and ſet out, and their claim cannot juſtly be thus nullified,
and yet their intereſt ſaid to be reſerved.</p>
               <p>3. It is granted, That the Lord <hi>Baltamore</hi> may have as large
a proportion of Land, as ever was granted to any by the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
though his adventures have never been proportionable to ſom<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mens.
But we think it agreeing to reaſon, that he ſhould peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
it, &amp; either ſhew his right to it by the adventure of people ſent
over to plant it, which was by the Company appointed to be
fifty Acres to every perſon tranſported thither; otherwiſe, how
unreaſonable is it, that he ſhould poſſeſs two third parts of the
<hi>Bay</hi> of <hi>Virginia,</hi> which may perhaps be ſaid to be as big as the
Kingdom of <hi>England<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> and yet now in many yeers
have not more men there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> except ſuch as have gone from <hi>Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi>
then can or do plant as much as is contained in a ſmall corner
thereof, and thoſe chiefly employed in Tobacco; and the great
name of <hi>Maryland</hi> is but in effect made a factory for Trade;
Ammunition and Arms being as commonly ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the greateſt part of the Country left void, and for the moſt part
not known by him or his.</p>
               <p>5. We ſay, that after we had diſcovered, and brought the
Indians of thoſe parts of <hi>Maryland</hi> to a Trade of Corn
and Beaver, by vertue of the King's inſtructions under the Broad
Seal of <hi>England,</hi> with the expence of our Bloods and Eſtates,
and exerciſed annual intercourſe with them above eight and
twenty yeers: how can it be ſaid, our Intereſts and Rights
are preſerved, when we are forbidden this Trade, our Men ſlain,
Veſſels and Goods ſeized, Perſons impriſoned, and the whole
Trade aſſumed onely to the Lord <hi>Baltamore</hi>'s uſe, and he not
able to manage it neither, but left it to the Swedes and
Dutch?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:54611:6"/>
6. And chiefly we anſwer, We claim Right by Poſſeſſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
having planted the Iſle of <hi>Kent</hi> almoſt three yeers before ever the
name of <hi>Maryland</hi> was heard of, and Burgeſſes for that place
ſitting in the Aſſembly of <hi>Virginia;</hi> whereby it is evident, that
the Lord <hi>Baltamore</hi>'s ſuggeſtions to the King, mentioned in his
Patent, that thoſe parts were uncultivated and unplanted, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
by barbarous people not having the knowledge of God, was
a miſ-information; and by it, that Patent appears to be ſurrepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly
and illegally gotten: and if the Lord <hi>Baltamore</hi> takes a
way thoſe Lands from them, who have alſo purchaſed the Intereſt
of the Natives, (a Right not inconſiderable) &amp; ſeize their Goods,
and that in an hoſtile manner as he hath done; How can it be
ſaid, that thoſe mens Intereſts and Rights are preſerved, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the firſt Diſcoverers of that Iſland, by vertue of the King's
Commiſſion, and planted there under the Government of <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia,</hi>
on the confidence they apprehended from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
aſſurances, and there began in great part the Trade of
Furs.</p>
               <p>How unjuſt an intruſion then will the Lord <hi>Baltamore</hi>'s
Patent appear, which overthrows the Intereſts of ſo many and
ſuch Perſons: for the Company of <hi>Virginia</hi> were of a nature di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſified
from other Companies; which if it had not been founded
on ſo good Grounds, yet their zeal and pious endeavours to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate
the true Chriſtian Religion, enlarge the Engliſh Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and to encreaſe the Trade and ſtrength of ſhipping, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably
the Cuſtomes, do deſerve juſtice, with addition of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
for ſo honourable and good intentions.</p>
               <p>In the next place, to prove the Lord <hi>Baltamore</hi>'s uſurpation
of Royal Juriſdiction and Dominion in <hi>Maryland,</hi> as abſolute
Lord and Proprietary, there needs no more then his Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
and Proceſſes running in this ſtile, <hi>viz. We, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, and,
Given under our hand &amp; greater Seal of Arms, in ſuch a yeer
of our Dominion,</hi> &amp;c. The Oath alſo, that he tenders to all
his Subjects and the Inhabitants, ſuch being the very words
thereof, as by the Oath it ſelf, copied from his own hand, and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:54611:7"/>
herewith publiſhed, appears. This is ſurely incompatible to
the Engliſh Nation, that there ſhould be any ſuch principality
erected over them, whereas the books of Law teach us, that
all Writs, Executions, and Commands ought to be done in the
name of the Supream Authority onely, and is ſo appointed by
the late Platform of Government, for all the Dominions of the
Commmonwealth, of which this is a part; and by a late Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
declaring Treaſon upon ſuch penalty, that none ought to
exerciſe any power, but in the Lord Protector's name; and
theſe men acting ſo wilfully, cannot excuſe themſelves. By the
ancient Engliſh Laws, all thoſe Pleas that concern Life, and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and Pardons, cannot be done in the name of any inferior
Perſon; and all Writs, Indictments, and Proceſs as heretofore,
ſo muſt now only be in the name of the Lord Protector, and not
in the name of the Lord <hi>Baltamore</hi>'s, as he hath aſſumed in <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryland.</hi>
And whereas the Lord <hi>Baltamore</hi> pretends to the like
priviledges as in the County-Palatine of <hi>Dureſme,</hi> even thoſe
priviledges of <hi>Dureſme,</hi> and all the other County-Palatines of
England, were, and are taken away as diſhonorable, and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruent
to the Engliſh Nation, by the Statute of the 27 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8.
25. With what ſtrange confidence then doth the Lord <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamore</hi>
publiſh to the world, That theſe Royalties and Priviledges
are warranted by his Patent, when as they are contrary to Law,
and to the Government now eſtabliſhed under his Highneſs, and
to a Clauſe in his Patent, wherein it is provided, That no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
be made thereof, whereby the Government in the
Common-wealth of England ſhould ſuffer any prejudice or
diminution.</p>
               <p>Whereby it appears there was as good Cauſe to reduce <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryland</hi>
as <hi>Virginia;</hi> the People, and General Aſſembly thereof
alſo complaining of their Grievance, among many other exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant
Uſurpations of Lord <hi>Baltamore</hi> over them, as appears by
their Complaint in Governor <hi>Green</hi>'s time, made and Recorded
there by a Committee of that Aſſembly: But 'tis known that
Governor <hi>Green</hi> was depoſed by Lord <hi>Baltamore,</hi> for ſuffering
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54611:7"/>
that Committee, and not for proclaiming the King's Son, as he
aleadgeth, when no ſuch thing appears in <hi>rerum natura,</hi> nor
no word in all his many Inſtructions, of the Parliament, much
leſs of his pretended affection to them, or their friends, but
clean contrary: And 'tis notoriouſly known that all the Lord
<hi>Baltamore</hi>'s Governors uſually took the Kings part againſt the
Parliament; and his Brother, Mr. <hi>Leo. Calvert,</hi> his only Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor
while he lived there, ever declared himſelf againſt them:
And to evince this irrefrageably, and clearly to demonſtrate the
management and complexion of this buſineſs, both Lord <hi>Balta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more</hi>
himſelf, and his Brother, by long Solitations at <hi>Oxford.</hi>
procured and ſent over in <hi>Anno</hi> 1644. Commiſſions under the
Kings Broad Seal, to ſurprize the Parliaments and <hi>London</hi>-ſhips
in <hi>Virginia;</hi> and to impoſe Cuſtoms, raiſe Regiments, and
Fortifie the Country againſt the Parliament; which appears by
ſeveral Writings under the Lord <hi>Baltamore</hi>'s Hand and Seal,
(one of which is hereunto annexed.) They did with zeal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
the Kings Son, <hi>Charles the Second,</hi> at <hi>Maryland;</hi> and
ſome that read it, and aſſiſted therein, of the primeſt rank, are
ſtill continued Counſellors by him, and never a word of blame;
whereas 'tis evident his own Intereſt is more than circumſpectly
watcht over, and contended for. How can he pretend that his
Governor, Captain <hi>Stone,</hi> bare any affection to the Parliament,
when without check from himſelf, in their Aſſemblies Laws, he
uſed the name of King, and His Majeſty; and of <hi>Charles</hi> the
Firſt, when the Second was Proclaimed there? And why did
Lord <hi>Baltamore</hi> himſelf in England adviſedly conſent and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
thoſe Laws <hi>in terminis,</hi> under his hand, 1650. if ſuch
had not been his own thoughts toward the Parliament? The
Commiſſioners that were imployed by the Parliament to Reduce
<hi>Virginia, Anno.</hi> 1652. were commanded to Reduce all the
Plantations in the Bay of <hi>Cheſapiak;</hi> and then, that all Writs
ſhould iſſue in <hi>the Name of the Keepers of the Libertie of
England:</hi> They ſaw not how they could decline this ſervice,
well knowing how contrary to thoſe Commands, and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
and Intereſt of the Parliament, the Government of <hi>Mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:54611:8"/>
was exerciſed; and think ſtrange any ſhould pretend aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
and ſupply of Victuals from <hi>Maryland</hi> to that Fleet, when
no ſuch thing ever was; that the Parliament Ships were enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
there in his Harbors, whenas never any of them came at
<hi>Maryland,</hi> nor within near 100. miles thereof, ſave only the
<hi>Ginny</hi> Frigot, who went thither to Reduce that Province; they
knew his Governor had alwayes bore affection to the Kings
ſide, that <hi>Charles</hi> the Second (as hath been ſaid) was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
there, that the Councel were all Papiſts, or indifferently
affected, and that they refuſed to Govern the people by the Laws
of <hi>England</hi> (another Clauſe in the Parliaments Commiſſion)
to which ſeveral of their actings, and even Lord <hi>Baltamore</hi>'s In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions
were contrary, as in this particular, and many others,
appears by the Reports of the Committee of the Navy, and
the Councel of State, to whom the Parliament referred this
Cauſe; a Copy of which Report is hereunto annexed: And
they ruled in <hi>Maryland</hi> in ſuch an abſolute way and authority,
as no Chriſtian Prince or State in <hi>Europe</hi> exerciſes the like.</p>
               <p>His Governor hath an abſolute Negative Voice in all things,
and in the Aſſembly of the Burgeſſes; calls into the Upper Houſe
(as he terms it) whom he will, to over-vote the reſt; places and
diſ-places whom he will in that Councel: and the Lord <hi>Balta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more</hi>
himſelf, though in <hi>England,</hi> appoints all Officers, even to
the meaneſt degree; and who flatter him moſt, are ſure to have
it: His Mandates are ſent over to ſtop Juſtice, and the Judges
impriſoned for proceeding according to Juſtice: Writs are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
out under the Governors hand in his own Caſe, without any
judgement of Court, to ſeize mens Goods into the Governors
hands: His Governors are not ſuable for any juſt debts, and ſo
they uſually exerciſe their priviledges, even to the oppreſſion and
diſcontent of the people: No Appeals allowed from their
Courts, though conſiſting but of two men, and thoſe perhaps of
no great knowledg or skill in Government, no not to the general
Repreſentative Aſſemblies. It would be infinite to rake in this
Dunghil; but all indifferent men that have lived and been there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:54611:8"/>
know theſe things to be ſad Truths; and ſurely not without
cauſe, have the general Aſſemblies there, moſt of the Councel
and the Freemen, been often conteſting with the Lord <hi>Balta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more</hi>'s
Governors about theſe things, and yet could never obtain
any redreſs from him; but have reſolved to Petition the State of
<hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Why therefore ſhould <hi>Maryland,</hi> ſo ill Founded, and ſo ill
Managed, be wrung from the right of <hi>Virginia,</hi> againſt all
Law and Equity, as is before truely ſet forth? And be eſtabliſhed
to Lord <hi>Baltamore,</hi> a profeſſed Recuſant, as his publiſh'd Book
intimates; who hath in effect made it a ſubject of his own do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
and tyrranny (being his main aim:) But to colour it,
and the better to get friends, firſt made it a receptacle for Papiſts,
and Prieſts, and Jeſuites, in ſome extraordinary and zealous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
but hath ſince diſcontented them many times &amp; many ways;
though Intelligence with Bulls, Letters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from the Pope and
<hi>Rome</hi> be ordinary for his own Intereſts; and now admits all ſorts
of Religions, and intended even 2000 Iriſh, and by his own
Letters clears and indemnifies one, that ſaid, <hi>Thoſe Iriſh would
not leave a Bible in Maryland.</hi> His Country, till he employed
Captain <hi>Stone,</hi> never had but Papiſt Governours and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors,
dedicated to St. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> as they call him and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
and Holyday kept ſolemnly: The Proteſtants for the moſt
time miſerably diſturbed in the exerciſe of their Religion, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
wayes plainly enforced, or by ſubtil practiſes, or hope of
preferment, to turn Papiſts, of which a very ſad account may
from time to time be given, even from their firſt arrival, to this
very day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Virginia</hi> hath uſed all good Neighbourhood towards them,
without which aſſiſtance and ſupply, even of all things, they
could not have ſubſiſted; for their numbers were inconſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and their Adventures ſmall and very little after the firſt
ſhip, in compariſon of ſuch a work. And though Lord <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamore</hi>
pretends great Adventures with his Friends thither; yet
none have appeared there to any conſiderable value from him
for many yeers, onely what Merchants, and ſome few have done
upon Returns of Tobacco and Beaver: ſo that in Truth it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:54611:9"/>
and that by his own Letters too, <hi>Maryland</hi> hath been
chiefly planted by <hi>Virginia</hi> from firſt to laſt, and by people
from thence wanting ſeats in their narrow limits; <hi>Maryland</hi>
taking away above half the Country, which (as hath been ſaid
before) was onely diſcovered by <hi>Virginia,</hi> with continual
Trade and abode of people there for above 20 yeers, by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions
and Warrants in the King's Name, and was planted by
Colonel <hi>Claiborn</hi> under <hi>Virginia</hi> Government, ſome yeers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ever the name of <hi>Maryland,</hi> or Lord <hi>Baltamore</hi> was ever
heard of there; which himſelf knew, though he miſ-informed
the King, and obtained his Patent upon pretence of Unplanted
places onely.</p>
               <p>But the many illegal Executions and Murthers of ſeveral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
at the Iſle of <hi>Kent</hi> by the Lord <hi>Baltamore</hi>'s commands and
his Officers; the Impriſonments, Confiſcations of many mens E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates,
and of Widows and Orphans, to the deſtruction of many
Families there; eſpecially his ſeizure of Captain <hi>Claiborn</hi>'s E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,
though out of his Patent, becauſe planted, to the value of
6000 pounds, with the great tyranny and wrong done there,
although the then King Declared and Commanded the contrary,
but was diſobeyed by the Lord <hi>Baltamore</hi>'s Agents, are too long
to be inſerted here.</p>
               <p>Many Inconveniences and Loſſes hath <hi>Virginia</hi> ſuffered by
<hi>Maryland,</hi> of which the continual Invitation and Entertainment
of run-away ſervants, and protecting fugitive perſons and indeb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
is not the leaſt: But above all, it is eaſie to be made appear
that the Lord <hi>Baltamore</hi> hath continually ever ſince their ſeating
there, interpoſed in the matters of Government in <hi>Virginia</hi> by
the potency of his friends in the late Kings Court, both by placing
and diſplacing the Governours, Counſellors, and Supream Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
as they ſtood affected or were diſpleaſing to him.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi> and Captain <hi>Claiborn</hi> being two of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners,
that were imployed by the Parliament to reduce <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia</hi>
and <hi>Maryland,</hi> are ſtrangely taxed by Lord <hi>Baltamore</hi>
for being his declared enemies: indeed, it ſeems for their ſervice
to the Parliament, he is become implacable towards them, though
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:54611:9"/>
Captain <hi>Curtis,</hi> another Commiſſioner now in <hi>England,</hi> and all
<hi>Maryland</hi> can teſtifie how unwilling, and how tenderly they did
any thing, there, and how much they deſired and endeavoured
to have declined any alteration, if either Captain <hi>Stone</hi> the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
or the Councel, would here iſſued out Writs in the name
of the <hi>Keepers of the Liberty of England,</hi> and have promiſed
to govern according to the Laws of <hi>England;</hi> both which they
refuſed under their hands: and the Commiſſioners being ſent to
<hi>Maryland,</hi> is ſince owned by the Report of the Committee of
the Councel of State, and the Lord <hi>Baltamore</hi> taxed and blamed
for not iſſuing out Writs as they required them; and therefore
ſeems a bold aſperſion for the Lord <hi>Baltamore</hi> to publiſh, that
<hi>Maryland</hi> being ſtruck out of their commiſſion, was afterwards

which they have accordingly done, and not the leaſt mention of

they continued obſtinate. The Commiſſioners were deſirous ſtill
to expect and attend a ſettlement and determination out of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>

vilified by Lord <hi>Baltamore,</hi> and publickly taxed for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure
factious fellows<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in his later Letters termed the baſeſt of
men, and unworthy of the leaſt favour or forbearance; ſuch
advantages doth he make on all ſides, at ſuch a diſtance, and in
ſuch incompoſed times, that he confidently takes the liberty to
aver ſuch extream and contrary things which amaze other men
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:54611:11"/>
that ſee them. The place, as himſelf confeſſes, had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted,
if not peopled from <hi>Virginia.</hi> He might with more reaſon
ſcruple to ſupplant the Rights of the moſt conſiderable conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
of worthy men that ever undertook ſuch an Adventure, as
Plantation out of <hi>England;</hi> which hath been the beginner and
parent of all the reſt.</p>
               <p>The late King <hi>James</hi> revoked the <hi>Virginia</hi>-Companies Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
for denying him to alter the Government, for which he had
fundamentally provided to give Inſtructions from time to time,
and was the ſame, which the laſt King did by his Commiſſion to
Sir <hi>William Davenant,</hi> of which the Lord <hi>Baltamore</hi> ſpeaks
ſo much, and makes ſuch inferences as ſerve his own ends. But
the Truth is, all that can rightly and properly be collected from
thence is onely this, (his right to the Soil being in expreſs words
reſerved) if the King might diſpoſe of the Government of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryland,</hi>
why not the Parliament, as they have done; and why
not the Lord Protector as he alſo hath done? Another of thoſe
Fundamentals was, That no Papiſts ſhould be tolerated to remain
in <hi>Virginia,</hi> but ſent away if they would not take the Oath of
Allegiance, and was ſo practiſed: this the old Lord <hi>Baltamore</hi>
refuſing, ſtayed not in <hi>Virginia;</hi> and, <hi>Hinc illa lachryma,</hi> to
all thoſe that were of the Councel, who with their wives and
children have not ſuffered a little for it; of which onely Colonel
<hi>Matthews</hi> and Colonel <hi>Claiborn</hi> remain alive. His Son this
Lord <hi>Baltamore</hi> now publiſhes himſelf a Recuſant, and avers
contrarily, that the Laws againſt Papiſts and Recuſants extend
not thither; yet his Patent ſayes, No interpretation ſhall be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
thereof, by which God's holy and truely Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or the allegiance due to the Succeſſors of the State of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
ſhould ſuffer any prejudice or diminution.</p>
               <p>By all which ſurely it's moſt evident, This County Palatine
aimed and coveted by him, appears diſagreeable to Law and to
his own Patent: and as a Monſter unlike the reſt of the Dominions
of the Commonwealth of <hi>England,</hi> &amp; contrary to the late Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:54611:11"/>
of Government under his Highneſs the Lord Protector;
yet hath he omitted no means to inforce his Dominion on thoſe
men that are moſt unwilling to ſubmit to him as an abſolute
Prince and hereditary Monarch. Neither doth that inſtance of
the Roman Commonwealth in his printed Pamphlet hold for
him, who though they permitted and continued many Kingſhips
over people that formerly had them, as is now done in <hi>Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi>
among the <hi>Indians;</hi> yet he cannot ſhew, that ever they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted
Kings over the people of <hi>Rome</hi> to govern abſolutely over
them, as this caſe pleads for, to have a negative voice, yea, and as
power <hi>ad placitum,</hi> in all things that is before ſpecified, to
the great regret of the Inhabitants, the oppreſſion of many, and
the obſtruction of juſtice, of which <hi>Maryland</hi> hath afforded no
mean examples and complement.</p>
               <p>But although <hi>Virginia</hi> ſeeks the re-eſtabliſhment of her bounds
ſo often aſſured under the great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> and otherwiſe,
yet to renew any ſuch Authority as this of <hi>Maryland,</hi> or that
of the Company over her, ſhe deſires it not; but to be from
time to time under ſuch Government as the State of <hi>England</hi>
ſhall appoint.</p>

            <p>IT cannot be unknown to the Inhabitants of <hi>Maryland,</hi>
that about two yeers ſince, this Province was Reduced and
Settled under the Obedience of the Common-wealth of
<hi>England,</hi> by the Parliaments Commiſſioners ſent thither
with ſpecial Commiſſion and Inſtructions to that purpoſe: And
that Captain <hi>William Stone,</hi> Mr. <hi>Tho. Hatton,</hi> and others,
re-aſſuming the power and place of Governor and Councel here,
undertook, and promiſed to continue in their ſaid Obedience,
and to iſſue out all Writs, Proceſs, and proceedings in the
Name of the Keepers of the Liberty of <hi>Engla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

by the ſaid Inſtructions, by which <hi>Maryland</hi> was Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced;
which ſaid Commiſſion and Inſtructions have been ſince
renewed, and the proceedings of the ſaid Commiſſioners owned
by the Committee of the Councel of State, as by their Order
and Report drawn up for the Parliament may appear, wherein
the Lord <hi>Baltamore</hi>'s Agents are taxed for refuſing to iſſue out
Writs in the Name of the Keepers of the Liberty of <hi>England.</hi>
Notwithſtanding all which appearing ſo clear and evident, The
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:54611:22"/>
ſaid Captain <hi>Stone,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hatton,</hi> though they continued,
and exerciſed the Government for ſome time, and for divers
Courts, in the Name of the Keepers of the Liberty of <hi>England,</hi>
yet have they ſince, upon no good ground, falſified their ſaid
truſt and engagement, though acted publickly, and after long
Advice and Conſideration: And having rejected, and caſt off
their ſaid Obedience to the Common-wealth of <hi>England,</hi> have
further refuſed to Govern this Province according to the Laws
of <hi>England,</hi> but declare and aſſume a power and practiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
thereunto, and contrary to the late Platform of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Common-wealth of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and the Dominions thereof; As namely, by the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors
Negative Voice in Aſſemblies, and his chuſing and remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Counſellors at pleaſure, and the like, is manifeſt. And
whereas we have lately received Commands from his Highneſs
the <hi>Lord Protector,</hi> to publiſh the ſaid Platform of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and that all Writs and Proceedings ſhould be iſſued in
the Name of his Highneſs; to which, though we deſire this
Government ſhould be conformable, yet the ſaid Captain <hi>Stone,</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Hatton,</hi> having lately Aſſociated unto them divers
Counſellors, all of the Romiſh Religion, and excluding others
appointed by the Parliaments Commiſſioners, have, and do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
to be obedient to the Conſtitutions thereof, and to the <hi>Lord
Protector</hi> therein; And have in the name, and by ſpecial di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of the ſaid Lord <hi>Baltamore,</hi> made Proclamation, and
exacted an Oath of Fidelity from all the Inhabitants of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
contrary, and inconſiſtent to the ſaid Platform of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
which ſaid Oath nevertheleſs, and the Law here
commanding the ſame, and many other Laws, are likewiſe by
the Report of the ſaid Committee of the Councel of State, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
to be contrary to the Laws and Statutes of the Engliſh
Nation; which is an expreſs breach of his Patent. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the ſaid Oath, in many particulars, is diſtaſted by all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of <hi>Maryland;</hi> and eſpecially out of tenderneſs of
Conſcience by all Northern Plantations of <hi>Patuxent</hi> and <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne,</hi>
who having lately engaged to the Parliament of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
do ſay, and declare, they cannot take the ſaid Oath to the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:54611:23"/>
Lord <hi>Baltamore</hi> to be abſolute Lord and Proprietary of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryland,</hi>
and to the utmoſt of their power, to defend and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
all his Rights, and Royal Juriſdictions, Prerogatives, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion,
&amp;c. Upon which their refuſal of the ſaid Oath, the ſaid
Captain <hi>Stone,</hi> by the ſaid Lord <hi>Baltamore</hi>'s eſpecial direction,
hath ſet forth a Proclamation, declaring, That all ſuch perſons
ſo refuſing, ſhall be for ever debarred from any Right, or Claim
to the Lands they now enjoy, and live on: And that the ſaid
Captain <hi>Stone,</hi> as his Lordſhips Governor, is thereby required
to cauſe the ſaid Lands to be entred, and ſeized upon, to his
Lordſhips uſe.</p>
            <p>By which ſtrange, and exorbitant proceedings, many great
Cruelties and Miſchiefs are likely to be committed, and many
hundreds, with their Wives and Families, are utterly ruined,
as hath been formerly done here, and at <hi>Kent.</hi> though Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
before the Lord <hi>Baltamore</hi>'s Claim to <hi>Maryland;</hi> with
many Murders, and illegal Executions of men, Confiſcations
of Eſtates and Goods, and great miſeries ſuſtained by Women
and Orphans: In Conſideration and juſt fear whereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the
ſaid Planters of <hi>Patuxent</hi> and <hi>Severne,</hi> have made their often
Addreſſes to us, as ſome of the then Commiſſioners for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement
of <hi>Maryland,</hi> and moſt lamentably Complain of
the great Danger they ſtand in of being utterly undone, and
chiefly for engaging their Fidelitie to the Common-wealth and
Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> now devolved to his Highneſs the Lord
Protector; their Obedience, and Faith to both, being plainly
repugnant to each other, and inconſiſtent.</p>
            <p>We therefore the Commiſſioners of the Parliament, having
written and propoſed to the ſaid Captain <hi>Stone</hi> and that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel,
for a Meeting, to procure a right underſtanding in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
aforeſaid, and to prevent the great inconveniences likely to
enſue; In Anſwer thereunto, though they acknowledge our

very next Line they add, <hi>We in plain terms ſay, We ſuppoſe you
to be Wolves in Sheeps clothing;</hi> with many other following

            <p>In Contemplation therefore of all the Premiſes, we have
