            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of your spouse, are dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse
and variable. wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he goth

precious vertues, and with
innumerable kyndes of flowers:
but the rosis of martyrs, and ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyes

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:16727:5"/>
no meruayl, though he loue that
that he is hym selfe, ye wherof he
is the very fountayne to al other.
I am (sayth he) <hi>Flos campi,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cant. 2.</note> the flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of the felde, and the lylie of
the valeyes. He is the prynce of
martyrs, for throughe hym mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs
are myghty and stronge. He
is the chiefe capitain of virgins,
for by him virgins do subdue the
flesshe, and the desyres thereof.
After that he descended downe to
the erthe, and hadde spredde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brode
the fyre of charitie, wynter
passed away, and these freshe flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers
sprouted vp euery where in
our countreye. Howe scarse was
virginitie before? But after that
Christe had ones consecrate vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginitie,
howe many thousandes
of yong men and women sprang
vp sodaynly through out all the
<pb facs="tcp:16727:6"/>
worlde, whiche wyllyngly gaue
them selfes to pure chastitie for
the kyngdom of god? After that
he, suffringe dethe on the crosse,
hadde taughte, that they were
very happye, that wolde dye for
goddis sake, howe many swar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
of men &amp; women came forth,
that wyllyngely yea and gladly
suffered deathe for the glorye of
Christe? Doutlesse for this cause
it is, that your spouse glorieth in
the Cantycles, where he saythe
thus, <hi>Ryse vp, haaste you my svvete
loue and my fayre dooue, and come. For
novve vvynter is paste, the shoure is
goone, oure grounde is couered vvith
fresshe floures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>¶Howe barrayne shoulde our
erth haue ben, if he the same he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
sonne had not kendled our
hartis with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hete his Charytie?
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:16727:6"/>
if he had not watred our mindes
with the showre of his grace?</p>
            <p>But what flourisheth fayrer then
the Euangelicall veer? What is
more plentyfulle? what is more
louely? The rosis ruddy hewe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bydeth
not longe, the beautie of
the lilye fadeth soone, wheron a
certayne Pagane writeth thus:
<q>
                  <l>Neyther smallage is lyuely,</l>
                  <l>Nor yet the shorte Lylie.</l>
               </q>
But those fresshe flowers, with
which the Churche is plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
furnyshed, do neuer wyther a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.
For Christe is the immortal
lylie, &amp; gyueth immortall grace
to his lylyes. He is the Rose im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall,
whose fresshe and fayre
colour dothe neuer fade, and the
same perpetuitie he gyueth vnto
his. He is called <hi>Flos campi,</hi> that is
the flower of the felde, bycause of
<pb facs="tcp:16727:7"/>
the Iewes. Fieldes be apte and
mete for tillage. Amonge the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes

Moyses and other prophet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes

coude neuer cause them to bryng
forth suche fruites as they loked

amonge the thorny and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tylled
gentiles, to whom it is per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>swaded,
that he became man, and
was borne of the Uirgin Marie
without spotte of synne. Surely
he was the euangelicall lilie, that
god the father so clothed, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
Salomon was arrayed in al

            <p>Surely all they that haue taken

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:16727:9"/>
that they being pure and chaste,
do singe pure and cleane balades
in honour of their pure and clene

            <p>
               <hi>¶O IESV</hi> the Crowne of vyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins,
whom she thy mother con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued,
whiche alone a virgyne
dyd beare, accept o moste mekest
these our vowes.</p>
            <p>¶O what greatte purytie is in
this virgin, he the prince of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins,
and spowse and crowne of
virgins, was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceyued of the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
spirite, and borne of a vyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,
the glorious beautie of vyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynite
not broken. Of wyues the
husbonde is the glory, but of vir<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gins
Chryste is the glorye: The
whiche dothe fede among lilyes,
compassed aboute with crownes
<pb facs="tcp:16727:10"/>
of virgyns, hyghtynge and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ournynge
his spowses with glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
and yeldynge to them rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des.
Your spowse is a sheparde,
which gaue his life for his shepe,
and is yet stylle carefulle for his
flocke. For daily he saueth them,
dayly he calleth theym hoome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geyne
that straye abrode, dayely
he cureth, and dayely he feedeth
theym. He hathe also his delec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
in whiche he taketh ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
he hathe his neere felowes,
whome he calleth husbandes, he
hath his playfeeres yonge may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,
whome he calleth wyues.</p>
            <p>In spiritual thynges there is no
difference of sexes, but they are
named and called after theyr age
and merites. Christ hath but one
spouse, whiche is the churche, she
hath many to accompanye her, &amp;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:16727:10"/>
euery one of them maye be called
a spouse. The spouse selfe is but
one, and yet hath he somme, that
he derely loueth, to whom he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mytteth
his wyues, soo that they
also in maner may be called hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandes.
For if byshoppes mowe
rightously be called shepherdes,
sythe there is but one shepeherde
our lorde Iesus, what shall than
lette them to be called husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des.
The wyues of this worlde, are
stately and proude of the gyftes
and dignitie of their husbandes,
they shewe and booste their gaye
garmentes and fresshe araye, for
such as haue no husbandes seme
as persones forsaken and desty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute.
But the spowse Iesus, for
the despised ornamentes of this
worlde, doth gaily hight and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourne
his spowses with dowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb facs="tcp:16727:11"/>
of the sowle: for the glorie of
the fleshe, whiche so soone vany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth
away, he gyueth them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall
glorie. Trewely to those
spouses, whiche folowynge the
example of the high shepeherde,
and lyke valyant champyons in
defence of his flocke, doo not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
to dye, he gyueth rewardes.
what rewardes? not a garlande
of oken leaues, or of laurell, not
an image, or a title, or some other
lyke rewarde, that the worlde
for dedes worthily done is wont
to gyue in recompence: but a gar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lande
euermore freshe and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rysshynge
in heuen, and a name
wryten in the booke of lyfe, that
neuer shall be blotted out by noo
age. This delitious and plesant
spouse, delyteth most specially in
this company, which for all that,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:16727:11"/>
lotheth no wel disposed person, be
he neuer so poore.</p>
            <p>¶There foloweth in the forsaid
hymne. Whyther soo euer thou
goest, virgins do folowe the, and
with laudes syngynge runne styl

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernyng
the fashion of the world
it is an vncomely thinge, to see a
virgyn wyllyngely rounne after
her spowse. But it were a fowler
syght, to see many virgins folow
one spouse. In thingis touching
the soule, it is otherwise, for there
is nothyng more goodly, then to
se many many virgins, that nere
accompany one spouse Iesu. Nor
it is noo meruayle, if they runne
after hym, as they were woode,
for loue of their spouse. For he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurethe

passeth all humayne loue.<note place="margin">Psal. 44.</note> He is
the feyrest among the children of
men, flowynge full of grace are
his lyppes, the whose vysage to

breatheth say:<note place="margin">Cant. 1.</note> Drawe me after

They can not renne, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepte

so euer he woll goo: they fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
hym euen to the very beatin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
they folowe him euen to the

            <p>¶Our lorde Iesus, what tyme
he was in this world, ofte tymes
ledde after hym greate and huge
multitudes of al sortis of people:
but whan he shulde go to Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem
to be slayn, fewe dyd acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panye
hym, but yet fewer, whan
he bearynge his Crosse, went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde

But they which be the very felo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes
of the spouse, whiche be true
<pb facs="tcp:16727:13"/>
virgins, coude not at this poynt
be plucked frome theyr spowse.
When he hynge vpon the crosse,
Peter, whiche was thoughte to
haue a wyfe, coulde no where be
founde, but the vyrgyns, Mary
the mother of Iesu and Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode
faste by the crosse, the other
women stoode afarre of, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>helde
what was doone. They fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
then, ye and that gladly and
wyllyngly: nor they folowe hym
not as dumme persons, but syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynge
balades, and makynge
swete melody.</p>
            <p>¶They that be mennes wyues
haue no leysure to be in the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
they haue no leysure, no ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
tymes they haue noo luste to
synge: they muste please theyr

braule with theyr maides and ser<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uantes,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:16727:13"/>
&amp; chastise theyr children.
Our virgins, being free from all
care and thought of this worlde,
do nothynge els, but in spiritual
quiers, synge swete hymmes to
theyr spouse. For they ascribe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge
to them selfe, but gyue al
the glory of theyr felicitie to him,
to whom onely they owe al thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.
He this louer deliteth in su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
maner songes, he wol, he wol
his gyftes to be songe: he hateth
the phariseis songis, I fast twise
in the Saboth, I gyue the .x. of
my goodes to the pore, I am not
as other men be. The more chast
that a virgin is, the more shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faste
she is. Here the voyce of a
very virgin:<note place="margin">Luc. 1.</note> Beholde the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayde
of our lorde. And he hath
sene the humilitie of his hande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayde.
In the cantycles he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth

his spouse a douue. He desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rethe
to beholde her shappe, and
coueteth to here her voyce:<note place="margin">Cant. 2.</note> Come
sayth he, my douue out of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
of the rockes, out of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
of the walle: O lette me see
thy vysage, and here thy voyce,
for swete is thy voyce, and fayre
is thy face. The soule hath his
face. The face is moste specially
estemed and iudged by the eies:
with the eies we shewe &amp; declare
our inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: also with the eies with
out voyce we signifie the inward
affections of our myndes. The
eie of a vyrgin is symple, she en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyeth
not, she lyeth not in awayt
to disceyue, she suspectethe none

thus: Howe fayre arte thou my

            <p>¶Here some wyll saye, What
swetenes is in the complaynyng
and mourning voyce of a douue,
to delyte and please a man with?
The nyghtyngales voyce shulde

By the waters of Babylon we

remembred the Syon.</p>
            <p>¶These lamentable voices and
ful of sighynges, are most accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
in the eares of the spouse,
in such maner of songes he moch
delyteth.</p>
            <p>¶And bycause they sayd, O mer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cyfull
lorde accepte our vowes, it
is tyme, that they nowe expresse
and declare, what they wold op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyn
of theyr spouse: Is it riches<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
is it honours, is it pleasures,
is it a kyngdome, is it long lyfe?
For those thinges care haue they
none, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t loue of their

to despise those thinges. What is
it than? we praye the, encreace
our myndes yet more largely, &amp;
graunt, that we mowe vtterly be
ignorant of all corruption. They
aknowlege howe great a tresure
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:16727:15"/>
vyrgynitie is, that is, A cleane

They also aknowlege, that what

wol vouchsafe to encreace it, and
to heape benefyte vpon benefyte.
Noo vyrgyn is soo pure, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che

profite. For you shall scasely find
any virgin, whiche to thende the

not otherwhile in thought.
Nor trewe virginitie resteth not
only in the gyft of chastitie, but
all vyce of the mynde is the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of this virginitie. Who
soo euer swarueth from the true

why saye they vtterly?
That is nother in mynde nor in
body. what is to say of all? what
soo euer the humayne affection
doth moue and styre vs to. This
vowe or request might seme vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable,
ne were it that the

spowse is almyghty, and mooste
faythfull of his promyse. He wol
not that his shal be only lyke vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

that no manne in this lyfe
can atteine to that, that the quier
of vyrgins dothe desyre, yet the
request of this moste thankefull

For that that they here throughe

            <p>There are degrees in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che

Ambroses. For besyde all other

wherin I suppose that man had

The churche the spouse of

            <p>¶But nowe to retourne againe
to those two flowers, farre pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>synge
all other most fragant, the
Rose and the Lilie. Lyke as the

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:16727:17"/>

the virginitie of Christe allured

They that ar drawen of him,

            <p>Christe sayde to Peter: Folowe

Peter? Who denyeth, but that we
be moche bounde to the holy doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours,
the whiche (euery thynge

But how many mo hath the fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graunt
swetenes of the martyrs,
drawen to the professyon of the
gospell? Yea howe many mo the
example of virgins? It is a gret
thynge, boldely and connyngely
to dispute of the gospelle: But
the greattest poynte is, gladly to
dye for the gospell. It is a great
<pb facs="tcp:16727:18"/>
thynge, to despise and set nought
by the glorye and ryches of this
worlde, but it is farre greatter to
mortifie and slee the fleshe with
the concupiscencis thereof. And
the churche knoweth to whome
she is bounde. The churche (next
Christ) hath had none in more ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nour,
than they, which wyllyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and gladly offred theyr bodies
to be cruelly turmented, for the

of the flocke, for the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
he hym selfe vouchesafed to
dye. They secondarily were had
in honour, whiche wyllyngly for
the kyngdome of god gaue them
selfe holly to lyue chaste. what a
great ioye and gladnes was it to
all the Churche, whan a martyr
constantly suffred dethe for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stis
sake? And howe great sorow
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:16727:18"/>
and lamentation, if any shranke

dyd the churche reioyce, if a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,
that myght haue be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> maried
to a man, wold rather put on the
holy vaile of chastite, and couple
her selfe to her spowse Chryste?
And how great sorowe was there
made, if any suche dydde caste of
her vayle, and wolde be maryed
to a man? Undoubted the losse of
a thynge, that is most dere, is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
greuous. with what feruente
loue dydde christen men in tyme
paste runne to the ashes of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs?
Howe holy was the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie

men, whan dayly olde men, yong
men, honest matrones, and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins,

they wold kys the cheynes, with
whiche they were bounde: whan
the swerde, with which they were
martered, was reserued and kept
amonge the holy relykes? What
memorie is more ioyfull, &amp; more
hye and holy to the churche, than

Ambrosius, Hierony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,
and many mo then can be
nombred, excell Ciceros aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunt
and flowynge style. What
thynge maye we coniecte to be
the cause? Truly the magnitude
of the martyrs dyd minister abu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
of eloquence, the ferue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tnes
of theyr myndes added strengthe
to theyr wordes, and deuotion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacritie.
Of what matter so euer
<pb facs="tcp:16727:20"/>
they write, theyr style is plentiful
and flowyng, But as oft as they
take in hande to endyte of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs
and virgins, now as it were
by diuine inspiration, they sowne
out, I wote not what thing farre
passynge mans capacitie. Those
thynges are not doone by mans
studye, but they are broughte to
passe by inspiration of the holye
goste, the whiche woll his sayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctes
to be so glorified, in the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
he desyrously gothe about to
be seen most glorious. We wold
graunt those thynges to be done
by man, ne were it that god (whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
inspireth the mindes of good
men) doth ornate the monumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
of martyrs and virgins with
so manifold myracles. For where
are wycked spirytes more tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented?
where are moo cured of
<pb n="02" facs="tcp:16727:20"/>
greuous sycknesses and diseases
that no phisitions coude heale?</p>
            <p>What emperour, what kynge is
he, with settynge vp of any ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
titles, steples, churches, col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legis,
commandyng diuine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shyppes,
dyd opteyne so greatte
honour ye in this world? Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
thus god dothe honour his
martyrs, the whiche semed here
poore abiectes and wretched cay<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tyues.
Thus he honourethe his
vyrgyns, the whiche beynge as
deed to the worlde, sette surely al
theyr holle hope in theyr spowse
Iesu. And they also aknowlege,
that what so euer they haue, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
all of the lyberall gyfte of
theyr spouse. But the glorye of
martyrs doth not lyghtly glytter
and shyne but after the deathe:</p>
            <p>where as virginitie euen in this
<pb facs="tcp:16727:21"/>
lyfe is ful gay and glorious. For
who is so barbarous, that wyll
not fauour a virgin? In the very
myddes of the ruffelynge war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res
the fierce and cruell ennemy
forbeareth virginitie. And if we
beleue histories, the dumme bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stis,
ye the hugest, the wyldest, &amp;
most cruell of them all, beare re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence
vnto vyrgynitie. Howe
greatly dydde the Romaynes in
olde tyme honour the relygious
virgyns, called <hi>virgines vestales?</hi>
what a naturall worshyppe and
glorie of virginitie is that, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
ydolaters do aknowlege, whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che
the barbarous ennemy dothe
reuerence, which the dumme bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stis
doo perceyue, and to whiche
the wylde beastis obeye? If soo
great honour be done to the vyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
of this worlde, howe moche
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:16727:21"/>
more honorable is the virgin of
Christe? O good vyrgyne, take
on the this holy pride, and repute
what so euer pleasures or honors
this world braggeth of, to be far
vnder thy dignitie. It is a holye
thyng to pride in your spowse, &amp;
a deuout thyng to glorie in him,
to whome you owe all thynges.</p>
            <p>It is also a sure thynge, trusting
faythfully in hym, to rise and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belle
agaynst the worlde, whiche
braggyngly shewethe forthe his
delectable pleasures. My mynd
is not at this tyme to write, what
so euer may be sayde in the laude
and praise of martirs or virgins.
You haue the bokes of Cyprian,
you haue the bokes of Ambrose,
of Tertullian and Hierome, of
which the two last, were wel nere
ouermoch in admiration of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginitie.
<pb facs="tcp:16727:22"/>
For the excellency of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginitie
wolde not soo be extolled,
that the preyse therof shoulde be
an iniurie to chaste matrimonie.
I recyte those thinges moste no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
vyrgins for this intente, that
you maye perceyue howe happy
and fortunate your College is,
the whose chaunce is to possesse
bothe those thynges, whiche she
the rich spouse of Christ the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
holdeth moste speciall in this
worlde. For you haue in kepyng
those mooste fragrant and swete
coses, of the .vii. brethern of the
Machabees, and of theyr mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whose fecunditie brought
forth no children to her husband
but to god, she fortunately redou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bed
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> losse of her virginitie, with
the martyrdome of so many son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
vyrgyns. She being a virgin
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:16727:22"/>
brought forth no frute, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> of al
women was giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but to one, but
yet she brought forthe bothe vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
and martirs. Of her self she
coude gyue none example of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginitie,
but she perfourmed and
dyd as moch as laye in her to do.
She taughte her chyldren to be
virgins, she exhorted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome,
and wolde haue suffred
martyrdome before theym, saue
that she feared their constancye,
by reason of their tender youthe.
And soo the glorie of vyrginitie
chanced not to the mother alyke
with the chyldern, but touchyng
the martyrdome, the laude of the
mother is soo moche the more, in
that she beholdynge the cruelle
turmentes, suffred in eche of her
lyttel chyldren, what soo euer the
cruell tourmentours coude do to
<pb facs="tcp:16727:23"/>
the bodies of them. This is more
stronger, then by turmentyng at
ones to be rydde from all peyne.
For the pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes are more cruelly
tourmented in the persecutynge
of their chylderne than in theym
selfe. And that knowethe ryghte
well the wytty crueltie of tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
which wreste out by turmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng
of the chyldren in theyr pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes
sighte, that they coude by
no maner of turmentes gette of
the parentes. Howe oft sawe she
beynge a woman and a mother,
her owne fleshe and bowels torre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
and rente to pieces? where was
nowe the feble freiltie of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> kynd?
where was the tender loue and
pitie that is wont to be more ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement
in mothers then in men?
Surely her deuout affection to
godwarde, ouercame al humain
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:16727:23"/>
pitie, and her feruent feythe ouer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>came
the feblenes of womanhed.

of euangelycal vertue, before the

there was noo place more

            <p>¶Nowe to you good vyrgyns,
that be the kepers of this so gret
a treasure, my wordes do theym

He hath in one self basket Lylies
myngled with roses. The bryght
beautie of the tone stryueth with
the tother, nor yet the tone is not
dusked or defaced of the tother:
but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tone by reason the tother is
with him, doth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more gaily glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and shyne, lyke as whan yuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
(as one sayd) is myngled with
purpull, or whan a shynyng pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyous
stone is set in yolow gold.
The stryfe is so doubtefull, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is more glorious a martir or
a virgin, that if the matter shuld
be called in contention, I dare
not boldly say, whiche of theym
shoulde be preferred the tone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the tother. Bothe the tone
<pb facs="tcp:16727:25"/>
and the tother are consecrate in
Christ: but yet we ar more bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de
to his crosse and passion, than to
his virginite. He giueth to them
the honorable title of blessednes,
whiche for the kyngdome of god
gyue them selfe to lyue in chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:
but yet he requirethe the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowynge
of the crosse. It semeth
a greatter thyng, that wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
it not, yet it maketh him
blessed, that wyllyngly wyll per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourme
it. And in the tyme of per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>secution
it is a right gret thinge,
for the glorye of god to haue the
mynde alwey prompte and redy
to suffre all kyndes of deathes.</p>
            <p>But tymes haue like as the See
hath, his tranquillities and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ete
caumes. And other while one
maye lefully escape the persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
handes. But if one be dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:16727:25"/>
to the last extremitie, the dea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>the
of the body is the ende of gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous
tourmentes, and the begin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nynge
of felicitie. A virgin hath
a longe and a parpetuall stryfe
with her housholde ennemie, the
whiche she can neyther laufullye
slee, nor escape by flyghte. This
housholde fooe is the fleshe, the
whiche whether we woll or woll
not, we muste carie about, nowe
and then rebellynge agaynst the
spirite. And that it shal not seme
easye to any man to subdue this
ennemie, we haue redde of those
that were ouercome with wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
entycementes of the flesshe,
the whiche coude not be vanquy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
with the verye terrour and
drede of dethe.</p>
            <p>¶Hytherto our collation hathe
pondered, whether of those two
<pb facs="tcp:16727:26"/>
shulde be more stronger: but me
semeth that virginitie in this, is
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> happier, that (as I by occasyon
sayde afore) the floure of martir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
doth not freshely sprede &amp;
florishe, but after deathe: where
as virginitie hathe her bryghte
beautie, her fayre fragrancy, her
grace and dignitie in this world.
Uirgynytie is the flower of the
sowle and mynde, but in the vy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage,
in the eyes, and in all the
holle state of the body, there shy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
a certayne angelicall pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and a flourysshynge clere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
not acqueynted with olde
age, here as it were myndynge &amp;
thynkynge to be, that all we loke
fore after this lyfe, whyche lyue
deuoutely and godly in Chryste
Iesu. The mynde holle and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupte
sparpleth abrode in the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:16727:26"/>
bodye her vigour and strengthe,
lyke as the mynde infecte with
vices sheweth in maner a glime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynge
lighte, or rather maketh a
grisely shewe in the selfe shappe
of the body. For carnall pleasure
is a fowle blemyshe to a mannes
owne body. Why doo not the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes
of good blessed menne waxe
olde in the resurrection? bycause
nowe the soule shall rule theym,
which woteth not what olde age
meaneth. As deathe commeth of
synne, so doth syckenes and age.
Take synne away, and age shall
seme the lesse: and if age chaunce
to come, it shal chaunce more flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishinge.
And therfore a virgyn
receyuethe nowe in this worlde
some parte of her felicitie, exhy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytynge
in this mortall bodye a
certayne spece or fachion of the
<pb facs="tcp:16727:27"/>
immortalitie to come. The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis
of this worlde are noo moore
careful for theyr souldiours, than
they be for the thynge that they
come of, of the which whan nede
requireth, they gather yong soul
dyours, the whyche thynge if it
shulde fayle, howe shoulde they
furnysshe an armye? And nowe
for a certayne yeres there hathe
ben noo suche persecution vnder
christen princis, as was vsed in
tyme paste vnder Nero, Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,
Iulian, and Maxentius.</p>
            <p>But whether the Christen feythe
be in better caase vnder these or
noo, it lyeth not in me to define,
surely by them it was drawen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a narrowe poynt. But how so
euer it be, if there shulde ageyne
chaunce persecution, the whyche
wolde require a martyr, where is
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:16727:27"/>
it more lykely that such a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany
shulde be gathered, than of them
the whiche despisynge al the fals
flatering vanities of this world,
haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>secrate theym selfes holly
to Iesu the celestiall spouse, the
which wyllyngly haue crucified
their fleshe to gether with the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis
and concupiscencis thereof,
and for the loue of theyr spouse,
haue contempned and sette atte
noughte that same pleasure, for
the fauour of whiche only many
mortall menne desiren euermore
here to lyue. A true virgyn doth
differre very lyttell from a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr.
A martir suffreth the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner
to mangle his fleshe: a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
dayly dothe with good wyll
mortifie her fleshe, she beinge in
maner a turmentour of her selfe.
It is somewhat more maystry to
<pb facs="tcp:16727:28"/>
tame an ennemye taken, than to
kyl him. A martyr deliuereth his
body to be persecuted: A virgin
kepethe her body in lowe subiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and maketh it obedient vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the spirite. wherfore shall the
virgin of Christ tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble and feare
the handlyng of the executioner?
Shall she require rychesses, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lycacies,
worldly pompe, world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
welthe, or worldly pleasures,
whiche causen other to be verye
lothe to leaue this lyfe? All these
thinges she hath now cleane for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken.
Shall nat she, whiche lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
nothing in this world, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
is deed to the worlde, whose
lyfe is onely Christe, which day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
maketh her turtyls mournyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
couetynge to be nerer ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to her dere beloued spouse, &amp;
to be imbraced &amp; clypped of hym,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:16727:28"/>
wil she not (I say) gladly deꝑt out
of this wretched body, in the whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che
she woteth wel she trauayleth
as a pilgrim farre from her lord?
what men haue suffred the tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes
of martyrdom more mer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uailously
and strongly than vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
Martyrs, Agnes, Cecilia,
Agatha, and other theyr felowes
innumerable? And therfore wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
a virgin is delyuered to the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner,
she dothe not begynne
her martyrdome, but makethe
an ende of that that she beganne
longe before. If those thynges
seeme to any manne ouer harde
hyghe and difficile, lette hym re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membre,
that the professyon of
a virgin is aboue the powers of
man, and egall with the dignite
of angels. But al they that weare
blacke vayles, are not virgins.
<pb facs="tcp:16727:29"/>
For lyke as they (accordynge to
saynte Paules doctryne) whiche
are true wydowes in dede,<note place="margin">1. Timo. 5.</note> be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scerned
frome those, whiche by a

and as that widowe, whych
lyueth in delytes of this worlde,
is sayde to be deade: ryght soo a
virgin, whiche loueth any other
thynge in this worlde thanne her
spouse, is not a virgin. There ar
in the gospel wyse vyrgins,<note place="margin">Mat. 25.</note> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:16727:29"/>
man, yet her mynde hath ben de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed
and spotted with filthy and
vncleane thoughtes. She that
lyueth syngle agaynste her wyll,
is maried: and she that wolde be
corrupted, if she might lefully, is
alredy corrupted. It is a thinge
of greattest difficultie, to represse
and kepe downe all cogitations
and inwarde thynkynges of a
wauering mynd: and yet ageinst
them assaylynge, there muste be
defence made with prayers, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge
of holy bokes, fastynges,
deuoute and godly occupations:
for why to assent to them is very
poyson. Eua the fyrste virgin,
dyd commune and talke with the
serpente, and therof sprange all
yuels: her eies were not chast, the
which the wanton intycement of
the flatterynge apple dyd adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb facs="tcp:16727:30"/>
and defyle. The gaye costly
apparaylle, the peynted face, the
pleasant and mery enditynges of
yonge men, the propre knackes
and gyftes sente to and fro, are
playne tokens and sygnes that
virginitie dieth. For whose plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
doth a virgin ones dedicate
to Christ, ornate and trimme her
selfe? Why dothe she coueyte the
companye of yonge men, the whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che
toke on her the veyle of rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
bycause the worlde shoulde
not se and beholde that that was

            <p>A woman that is maried, dothe
decke &amp; trymme her selfe to plese

            <p>If she so did neglect to make her

how dare a virgin make her

the whose spouse is in heuen? To
what intent doth she that is ones
betrouthed to Christe, stande lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynge

a clene soule, and a well peynted

hath, it is theirs, that make them
selfe gorgeous and gaye for the

more richely arrayed with despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>synge

            <p>¶It dothe appere by olde mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numentes
and wrytynges, howe
high and howe laudable a preise
it was for virgins, to wasshe the
feete of myserable creatures, to
washe poore folkes clothes, to at<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tende
vpon sycke folke and serue
theym lowely, and for the loue of
Christ to handel and touch theyr
bodyes ful of sores and botches.
A virgin slubbred &amp; soylled with
<pb facs="tcp:16727:32"/>
those thynges, is most fayre and
beautyfull in the syght of Christ.
But for so moche as the institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of holy and deuout virgins,
is now otherwise, let them stryue
amonge theym selfes in the offy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and workes of charitie, and
prepare with theyr handes, wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>with
they may helpe and succour
the pore and nedy. And if it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
a virgin at some tyme to haue
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication with secular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
let this be her studye, that
they maye go awaye from her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
by her talkynge, and she
her selfe nothynge appayred. Let
the example of the fyrste virgine
make you more wary and sly, the
which beinge corrupted by spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynge
with the serpente, threwe
her selfe into lamentable mysery.
A yonge manne with his slypper
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:16727:32"/>
countenaunce, with his wanton
eies, and with his rebaud tonge,
is wors tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any serpent. Se that
you folowe the newe virgin, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and princesse of your institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
she talketh not with the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
but being close shutte with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
her secrete chaumbres, talketh
with the angelle, and therof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
all our helthe. A virgin that
talketh with an vnchaste yonge
man, speaketh with a serpente. A
virgin whiche with deuoute vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes
and prayers callethe vppon
god, which hath her meditation
in holy bokes, speaketh with the
angell, or rather with her spouse.
Whether of these two is mooste
sure? whether is moore honeste?
whether is more magnificent?</p>
            <p>Wherfore if at any tyme the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of those thynges, the whiche
<pb facs="tcp:16727:33"/>
as right swete &amp; noble the world
braggyngely bosteth, shall tikyl
your myndes: cal to remembra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
as the trouthe is, that you haue
not forgone those thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges, but to
your great lucre to haue made a
chaunge. And therfore there is
nothyng more vnfortunate than
those, which letted by carnall lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stis,
can neyther vse the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
of this worlde, which they
mooste desyre, nor yet theyr owne
pleasures. The worldly virgins
haue theyr playe felowes, they
haue theyr orname<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, theyr spor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes
and pastymes, theyr songes
and theyr daunces, but these thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges
such as they be, they haue no
longer than theyr freshe flourys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shynge
and tender youthe endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth.
But as al these thinges are
to the virgins of Chryste trewe
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:16727:33"/>
and inwarde pleasures, soo they
be euerlastynge. These worldely
virgyns settynge a syde the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande
of virginitie, do take and
put vppon theym the mantell of
mariage, without dout (as saynt
Paule saythe) a playne token of
bondage and thraldome. But vir<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gins
dedicate to god, be alwaye
kepte close for theyr spouse, leste
the worlde an aduoutrer shuld se
theym. For Iesus is a ielous lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
he can not suffre to haue his
dere derlynges sette and shewed
forthe to the syght of the worlde.
But whether is it more plesante
and more welthy to be the hande
mayde of a maried manne,<note place="margin">Luc. 1.</note> or the
hande mayde of Christe? <hi>Ecce in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit,
ancilla domini,</hi> Beholde (sayth
she) the hand mayde of our lord.
Who so euer is truely the hande
<pb facs="tcp:16727:34"/>
mayde of our lorde, is lady of the
world. O good virgin, interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
what thyng thy veyle betoke<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neth,
it is the sygne of a kynge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and not of bondage. They
that are veyled and couered for
theyr husbandes pleasures, doo
professe a worldly bondage. Nor
the commaundement of maryed
men, good virgins, is not alway
lyghte and easye. Often tymes
where you wende to haue hadde
husbandes, you chaunce vppon
maisters harde to please, vppon
suche as are froward and neuer
contented, vpon such as be curst
and knauishe, vpon dycers, dru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerdes,
riotttous spenders, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
suche as be greatly indetted, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
suche as be scabbed and scuruy,
vppon frantycke felowes, and
vppon fyghters, besydes many
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:16727:34"/>
other more greuous and wycked
condicions or diseases, whiche I
speake not of. More ouer there
foloweth care of the householde,
care of children, busynes of kyns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folke
and frendes, stryfe in the
worlde, lacke of children, bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enge
of husbandes. For why the
affliction of the flesshe is of noo
symple sorte, the whiche sayncte
Paule signifieth vnto them, that
woll rather chose wedlocke than
virginitie. My pourpose is not
nowe by reason of this declama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to discriue, what so euer grefe
or incommoditie foloweth mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.
And yet to lerne them by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
is but a wretched wyse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:
better it were to come by
the knowlege of them by redyng
the bokes of lerned men. But in
case you woll not gyue credence
<pb facs="tcp:16727:35"/>
to lerned mens writynges, than
call vnto you good virgyne one
of them, the whose chaunce was
to be verye welle and welthylye
maryed, and desyre her, that she
woll vouchesafe to telle and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
to you the true story of her
mariage: you shal here suche re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenynges,
that you shal nothing
repent you of your pourpose.</p>
            <p>Nowe lay before your eies, the ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>aumples
of vyrgins, the whose
chaunce was mooste vnluckely
and vnwelthily to be bestowed &amp;
maried, of which there is a huge
great company: and thynk thus,
that what, soo euer chaunced to
them, might chance to you. What
so euer yuelles, what so euer ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities
and myseries chance to
them, that be maried to a mortal
man, can in no wise hurt or greue
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:16727:35"/>
those, the whiche truely, the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
with harte and mynde mary
them selfe to the immortal spouse
Iesu. Beleue me, your spouse Ie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sus
is in nothynge sorowfulle or
heuy, but in al thynges pleasant
and louely. He semed some tyme
to haue neyther fayre shape nor
goodly beaute, but he was neuer
more louely, than whan for the
loue of his spouse he dyd vppon
hym that same shape and forme.
What mayde is she, that wolde
not make farre moch more of her
wower, if he being a noble mans
sonne, wolde forsake his fathers
ryches &amp; tresure, &amp; clothed with a
homely husbandes wiede, wolde
runne to her cotage, being a pore
mayde to the intent to opteyn her
to his wyfe? But what yf he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
not to be greuously wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded
<pb facs="tcp:16727:36"/>
in hastynge hym to come to his
entierly beloued spouse? Shuld
not he, so poorely clothed and all
bloudy with his woundes, seme
more louely? whithout doubt he
shulde so seme to her that loueth
hym. Nowe thanne thynke with
your selfes, whether your spouse
shulde with a stately countena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
be of you disdayned, whiche for
your sake lefte his fathers moste
royall palaice, descended downe
into this world, and cloking and
hydynge the maiestie of his dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyne
nature, toke vppon hym
the shappe and fourme of a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant,<note place="margin">Phil. 1.</note>
humblyng hym selfe to the
verye igmony and shame of the
crosse. A monasterie to a virgin
that louethe her spowse, is not a
prison (as some sklaunderously
do saye) but it is a paradyse. It
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:16727:36"/>
is not lefull for you to wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der and
walke aboute whither your luste
leadeth you: perdye this thynge
for virgyns is neyther surenor
honeste, and therfore you shulde
not desyre it. Excepte peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
the example of Dina plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sethe
you. Uirgynitie is neyther
sorowfulle nor heuy, but a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saunt
thynge. Uyrgynitie hathe
her fayre orchardes to walke in
holye Scrypture, in the whiche
she may sporte and play amonge
that mooste goodlye companye
of her spowse. O good lord with
what maner companye? With
Tecla, with Cecilia, with Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha,
with Theodora, with Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stochio,
and other innumerable.
Also virginitie hath her spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
garla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, made and wrought
with fresshe flowers of dyuers
<pb facs="tcp:16727:37"/>
vertues: she hath her swete pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunders
and sauours, soo that
virgins maye say with Sayncte
Paule, <hi>Bonus odor sumus deo in om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni
loco,</hi> That is to saye, We be a
good sauoure vnto god in euery
place. Also the spowse hathe his
delicate and swete spirituall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders,
of whiche the fragrant
swetenesse excellethe all aroma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike
sauours. Whatte is more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable
than the name of Iesus?
His name is a sweete smellynge
sauour, that is sparpled abrode.
The virgins being drawen with
that sauoure, to folowe hym as
faste as they can runne, what te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diousnesse
canne they haue or fele
in this lyfe?</p>
            <p>¶A virgin also hath her swete
pommaunder, wherwith in lyke
maner she pleaseth her spowse.</p>
            <p>

            <p>Uyrgyns haue theyr harpes of
