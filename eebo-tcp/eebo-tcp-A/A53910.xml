            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>CHAP. I. Of the Colick.</head>
            <p>THE Colick takes its Name from the part affected, which is the Colon, a long and winding Gut, appointed to receive the Excrements of almoſt the whole Body; and if thoſe Excrements are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained too long, they are wont to occaſion Pains of this kind, the Excrementitious Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter occaſioning a Diſſolution of the continuity either by diſtending, or pricking, or corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; and this Matter is either Wind or Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:57356:6"/>
Wind proceeding from Crudities, or from a cold intemperies of the Stomach or Guts, if it be ſtop'd by reaſon the Excrements are grown hard, or becauſe ſomething elſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs the Inteſtines (a great quantity of it remaining in the great Guts, eſpecially in the Colon) occaſions violent Pain.</p>
            <p>Groſs cold and phlegmatick Humours dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven into the Tunicles of the Inteſtines, may occaſion ſuch Pain, either by gnawing, if they are Acrimonious or Briney, or by chilling the part which is conſequently bound up thereby, and much diſordered, (as <hi>Galen</hi> ſays, when he was grievouſly afflicted with the Colick, he evacuated a Glaſſy ſort of Phlegm actually cold,) or by emitting Wind, which is eaſily elevated by a ſmall Heat from the groſs viſcid and clammy Humour.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Cholerick and Acrid Humours, and alſo Melancholy and Acid by pricking and twiching the Inteſtines, cauſe ſuch Pains. But it may be ask'd how it comes to paſs, that in the action of theſe cauſes, the Colick ſhould have its exacerbations and remiſſions, the ſame Matter remaining in the Inteſtines, which as 'tis preſent, ſhould continually gnaw and diſtend. To which I anſwer, that ſometimes that Matter remains quiet, and ſo at that time occaſions little or no pain; but that at other times 'tis moved and excited by various Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations, which happen in the Humours, as is uſual in an Epilepſie, Hyſterick Fits, and the acceſſion of Fevers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:57356:6"/>
But we muſt take notice that the Wind or Humours don't only reſide in the Cavity of the Inteſtines, for then they would be eaſily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, by evacuating deterging and carmina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Medicines; but for the moſt part inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate themſelves into the Coats of the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines, and for that reaſon they are difficultly removed; and ſo the Diſeaſe laſts longer, and can't be eaſily eradicated by the foreſaid Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies. The groſs and phlegmatick and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy Humours flow by little and little through the Veins of the Inteſtines, into their ſubſtance, and ſo don't preſently cauſe Pain, 'till there is a quantity ſufficient to irritate Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for their expulſion; and then being mov'd and exagitated, cauſe Pain. Or Wind, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd by them, and included in the Coats of the Inteſtines, diſtends and twitches them, and not eaſily getting out, occaſions a laſting Pain. Alſo Choler after the ſame manner pour'd through the Veins of the Inteſtines upon their Coats, and imbib'd by them, cauſes violent Pains, which are wont to be long and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, becauſe 'tis difficultly removed from their Subſtance.</p>
            <p>There is another Species of a Bilious Colick which degenerates into a Palſie, ſcarce known to the Ancients, which proceeds from a bilious Humour, not pour'd as the former upon the <hi>Colon,</hi> but of a ſudden upon the Membranes of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> which is transferr'd thither, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the Gaul-Bladder, or from the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentery in the Criſis of long Fevers, or by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of violent Anger, or ſome other external
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57356:7"/>
cauſe, when becauſe of Obſtructions, it can't be carried to the common paſſages, but by a prepoſterous motion is put off ſuddenly upon the foreſaid Membranes of the <hi>Abdomen.</hi> And hence great pain ariſes like the Colick, which yields neither to Clyſters nor to any other Remedy, but continues for many Months, by which the Body Waſts, and the Sick is vex'd with a ſort of intermittent Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and often with a ſlow continual Fever; at length the pain remitting, a Palſie ſucceeds, that Humour leaſurely creeping through the Membranes of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> to the Spine of the Back. But this Palſie chiefly poſſeſſes the upper parts; yet there is moſt commonly a Pain in the Thighs and Legs, and in ſome few the uſe of them is wholly taken away; the Choler by reaſon of its Levity moving chiefly upwards; and ſometimes it breaks in upon the Brain, and cauſes Epileptick Fits, from whence Death generally follows.</p>
            <p>There are other cauſes of the Colick, but leſs frequent, <hi>viz.</hi> Stones growing in the Guts, Worms wound up in a bottom, and Obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the Inteſtines, a compreſſion of the Guts, by a tumour of the Neighbouring Parts, and the narrowneſs of them by reaſon of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamation, and other tumours of the Guts, or a twiſting of them, occaſion'd by Wind, which is next to an Iliac Paſſion; and ſometimes the Matter which cauſes a Colick is venomous and malignant, and ſo 'tis a Peſtilential Colick. As <hi>Paulus Aegineta</hi> relates, that a Peſtilential Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ariſing in <hi>Italy,</hi> was very troubleſom to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57356:7"/>
many of the Roman Provinces. Laſtly, all hard Bodies by obſtructing the Guts, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtending them, may occaſion a Colick, as Stones generated in the Guts, a great quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Cherry Stones, hard Cheeſe, and the like. As <hi>Platerus</hi> relates of a certain Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour a long while troubl'd with the Colick and Convulſions, who after the uſe of Clyſters, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuated a great quantity of hard Cheeſe by Stool, which had remain'd a long time in his Guts; for before he was Sick, he eat of it immoderately.</p>
            <p>The external cauſes, are a cold conſtitution of the Air preſſing and hardening the Belly, or a hot Conſtitution which does likewiſe harden the Excrements, for all their Moiſture is dry'd up by heat: The uſe of Meat and Drink un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for the Mans Conſtitution, of crude and harſh Fruits, and of groſs Meats of hard Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, too much Reſt, immoderate Sleep, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable Exerciſe, immoderate Venery, and other external Cauſes which may injure the Concoction of the Stomach. The Diagnoſticks in this Diſeaſe are plain, for firſt the Pain is violent; for if it be ſmall, it ought not to be called the Colick; and then the pain is wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, ſometimes it grievouſly afficts this part, ſometimes that, ſo that ſometimes it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſeth the Region of the Spleen, ſometimes of the Stomach or Liver, or of the Reins, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times 'tis above, ſometimes below the Navel, and oftentimes 'tis moſt violent in the left ſide, becauſe in that part there is a narrowneſs firſt obſerv'd by <hi>Bauhinus.</hi> For when the Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57356:8"/>
in the upper and capacious part of the Colon being hardened into great Clods, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the capacity of it, are violently driven by the Wind towards that narrow part, they can't paſs through without great pain; by reaſon of which Symptom the Colick is often taken for Splenetick or Nephritick Pains; neither are they eaſily diſtinguiſh'd when the Signs of each are compared one with another. But ſometimes the pain is more fixed and ſetled in one place, and like the boring of an Auger. The Patient often Vomits, the Stomach being affected by conſent of Parts, and Phlegm is ſometimes caſt up, and ſometimes Choler, green as a Leek, and like Verdegreaſe: The pain is increas'd after Eating, becauſe the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach being full, preſſes the Guts. The Belly is moſt commonly ſo bound, that the Sick can evacuate nothing that way, not ſo much as Wind; but if any thing be evacuated natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally or by art, 'tis chiefly windy, and like Cow-Dung, and Swims upon the Water, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the moſt part Phlegmatick; for Phlegm voided by Stool, is wont to ſwim upon Water and ſerous Excrements: But ſometimes the Belly is ſo much bound when the pain is vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, that ſtrong Purging Medicines will not work at all.</p>
            <p>The Signs of the Cauſes are diſtinguiſh'd af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner.</p>
            <p>If the pain proceed from Phlegm, 'tis not ſo violent, unleſs it be accompained with Wind, which can't break out of the Places 'tis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in, for then the pain is violent, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57356:8"/>
ſometimes remains in one part, and ſeems to bore as with an Auger, and ſometimes 'tis in many Parts, when the Wind wanders about. The Sick is eaſed by hot things, but is injur'd by cold things. A courſe of Diet went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, apt to increaſe Phlegm. The Urine is crude and ſometimes whitiſh, but not always which is wont to impoſe upon young and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilful Phyſicians, for ſometimes in a Phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic and Windy Colick, the Urine is yellow and red diſh, by reaſon of the Pain which inſlames the Humours contain'd in the Veins and Arteries. Which <hi>Avicen</hi> has wiſely obſerv'd, <hi>He ſays, no one ſhould deceive himſelf, by judging the Diſeaſe is hot, from drouth, inflamation, and redneſs of the Water, for 'that's common to all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the Colick is occaſion'd by Wind, there is a ſtretching Pain, and certain inflation of the Belly: The Sick perceive a great deal of Wind, and a rumbling of the Belly, they are much eaſed by breaking Wind. A courſe of Diet fit to breed Wind went before, as unſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Drinking of cold Water, the frequent uſe of Pulſe, Turneps, Cheſnuts, Herbs and Fruits, and the like. And if the Wind be contain'd in the cavity of the Inteſtines, the Pain is wandering, and not fix'd to one Place, and is renew'd by Intervals; but if it be kept in within the coats of the Guts, the Pain is fix'd, becauſe the Wind can't change its place, and is continual and obſtinate, becauſe it can't find vent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:57356:9"/>
If the Colick proceeds from an Acrid and Cholerick Humour, 'tis moſt ſharp; there's a twiching and pricking Heat, Drouth, and for the moſt part a Fever, and the Urine is very Cholerick, and the Diſeaſe is increas'd by hot Medicines and Diet, and is mitigated by cold, and likewiſe by the excretion of Cholerick Matter, and a courſe of Diet fit to breed Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler went before. The pains of the other parts contain'd in the lower Belly, are eaſily diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd from the Colick by their proper ſigns, except the Nephritick pain, whoſe ſigns are ſo like thoſe of the Colick, that oftentimes the moſt skilful Phyſician can't diſtinguiſh them, as <hi>Galen</hi> confeſſes of himſelf, being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with the Colick Pain, he thought 'twas Nephritick, by reaſon of a Stone driven into one of the Ureters, 'till the Humour being evacuated by Stool, and ſo the pain ceaſing, he found 'twas the Colick. But by the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Signs, theſe two Diſeaſes may be plainly diſtinguiſh'd, if they are accurately ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin'd.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The Nephritick pain is fix'd in the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and ſtretches it ſelf from that to the <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtis,</hi> according to the length of the Ureter; but the Colick is wandering, and painfuly girds the lower Belly.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Colick increaſes after Eating, by reaſon of the preſſure upon the Gut by a full Stomach; but the Nephritick pain is not at all increas'd after Eating, but rather leſſen'd, becauſe ſome of the nutricious Juice is carried
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57356:9"/>
to the Reins, which ſomewhat aſſwages the Pain.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, In the Colick, Vomiting is more ſevere, and the Belly is more bound, becauſe the Colon lies near the bottom of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and the Inteſtines being full or violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provok'd, contract themſelves, that they may expel the Enemy; but either of the Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms is common to either of the Diſeaſes: So that the intenſion or remiſſion of them, has a difficult diagnoſtick; for the Nephritick pain being intenſe, may occaſion greater Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting, and bind the Belly more than a remiſs Colick.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, In the Colick, the Patient is more eas'd by Vomiting and going to Stool, than in Nephritick Pains.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, In the Nephritick pain, the Urine is firſt clear and thin, afterwards ſomething ſettles to the bottom, and at length Sand or Gravel is evacuated: But in the Colick the Urine is thicker, from the beginning.</p>
            <p>As to the Prognoſticks, the Colick moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly, if it be gentle and remiſs, and not very laſting, and not fix'd in one part, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, and does not wholly ſtop the Belly, is curable and without danger. But if the pain be violent and fix'd to one part, and does not intermit, and if nothing be evacuated by Stool, and if the Patient can't Sleep; and laſtly, if Vomiting, Hickocks, Delirium, Coldneſs of the Extream Parts, and cold Sweats follow, the Diſeaſe is Deadly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:57356:10"/>
An obſtinate Colick from Acrid Matter, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially occaſion'd by Choleric Matter, often degenerates into other moſt dreadful Diſeaſes, as to the Gout or Epilepſie, but oftner to the Palſie.</p>
            <p>A contagious Peſtilential and Epidemick Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick is moſt commonly deadly.</p>
            <p>The Cure of this Diſeaſe muſt be varied according to the variety of the Cauſes.</p>
            <p>And Firſt, There is the ſame way of Cure for a windy and Phlegmatick Colick: You muſt begin with an emollient Clyſter, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards you muſt give a carminative and diſcutient Clyſter, which muſt be repeated twice, thrice, or four times in a Day, till the Pain be gone. But if after the uſe of one or two Clyſters, the Sick does not go to Stool, as ſometimes it happens, the Belly muſt be irritated by a ſharp Suppoſitory; but 'tis convenient to add to one of the Clyſters ℥iiij of the <hi>Aq. Benedicta,</hi> or <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ij, or <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>iij of Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quintida may be boil'd in an emollient and carminative Clyſter.</p>
            <p>If Clyſters don't give eaſe, you muſt not obſtinately perſiſt in the uſe of them; but 'tis better to uſe ſome gentle Medicine. It has been obſerv'd, that when a Sick Perſon has taken without any ſucceſs Thirty Clyſters, another Phyſician having given only ℥iſs of Manna, with ℥ij of Oyl of Almonds in Fat Hen Broth, has cur'd the Patient: But in that pain which proceeds from thick Flegm, ſtronger Medicines muſt be given.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:57356:10"/>
Afterwards Fomentations, Ointments, Baths, Plaſters, and other Remedies, are uſeful; to which muſt be added ſome Specificks very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in this Diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>Waſh the Guts of a Wolf in White-wine, and afterwards dry them in a Furnace, in an Earthen Veſſel, till they may be powder'd, let the Sick take <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>i of this Powder in White-wine, it preſently eaſes pain. Boil Simple Water, and when 'tis Boiling Hot, add a Fourth part of common Oyl, and ſome Grains of Pepper groſly beaten; let the Sick take Three or Four Spoonfuls as hot as he can bear it, the pain will be gone as 'twere in a moment.</p>
            <p>Take of the beſt Aloes <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>i, of Laudanum Opia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, gr. iv, of Diagridium, gr. vi, Mingle them, make Six Pills, guild them. Let the Sick take them at a convenient time, they give eaſe in an Hours time, and afterwards purge off the noxious Humours. Inſtead of the Pills, a Potion may be taken, made of ℥ſs of Diaph<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Take of the Oyl of Almonds, or of ſome other Oyl for Poor People ℥iiij, of Generous Wine ℥i, of Syrup of Poppies ℥i, mingle them, make a Potion.</p>
            <p>Oyl of Sweet Almonds alſo taken with Manna in fat Broth, aſſwages the pain, and evacuates the Peccant Matter.</p>
            <p>The Seed of Ammi powder'd, and <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>i of it given in Wine, ſoon takes off the pain, and being given a Second time, it moſt commonly cures the Diſeaſe; a Cataplaſm of ℥iij of Turpentine being apply'd with Stupes at the ſame time, to which muſt be added of the Sinapiſatum Piperis, and of Dragons Blood, each <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>i.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paracelſus</hi>'s <hi>Galbanetum</hi> is proper to diſcuſs the Humour, if the whole Belly be anointed with it: This Deſcription of it is propos'd by <hi>Crato.</hi>

            <p>And tho the foreſaid Plaiſters are not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, yet the Cupping-Glaſs ought to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd to the Navel, which <hi>Galen</hi> ſays, does like a Charm, remove the pain occaſion'd by Wind.</p>
            <p>If the Diſeaſe is laſting, it may be ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully treated with the Decoction of <hi>Guaiacum</hi> continued for many days, purging now and then, and injecting Clyſters frequently; but if the Colick proceed from glaſſy Phlegm, boil the Guaiacum with Wine, as <hi>Amatus Lucitanus</hi> us'd it with good ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>The pain being quieted, an Apozem evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Phlegm is to be preſcrib'd, by which the Reliques of the Diſeaſe may be carried off, or inſtead of that, a decoction of an old Cock, compounded of ſuch things as purge and atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate.</p>
            <p>A bilious Colick is cur'd by emollient Clyſters, and with ſuch things as attemperate the Acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the humours.</p>
            <p>Let the Belly be fomented with an emollient and anodyne Decoction, or which is better, let a <hi>Semicupium</hi> be prepar'd of the ſame Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:57356:12"/>
A Cataplaſm will alſo be convenient, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd with Barly-meal, and Flax-ſeed boil'd in Oyl of Camomel, and apply'd to the bottom of the Belly.</p>
            <p>Alſo a cooling Epithem compounded after this manner, to be apply'd to the region of the Liver, will be proper:</p>
            <p>Take of the Juice of Endive, of Cichory, each thſs. of the Juice of Lettice and Roſe-Vinegar each ℥ij, mingle them, make an Epithem.</p>
            <p>Give Juleps of the water of erratic Poppy, of Lettice and Sorrel, with the Syrups of Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, of Apples, and of Lemons.</p>
            <p>If the pain is very violent we muſt uſe Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coticks. The pain being ſomewhat mitigated, an infuſion of Rubarb in Cichory-water is to be given, with Syrup of Roſes, and to be repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed often, till the ſtock of matter is evacuated. If gentle purging be not ſufficient to eradicate the Diſeaſe, we muſt uſe <hi>Mercurius dulcis,</hi> which being given ſometimes with Purging Medicines, that have <hi>Diagridium</hi> in them, perfects the Cure. They that diſlike <hi>Diagridium</hi> may give <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius dulcis</hi> alone, made into Pills with Conſerve of Roſes, drinking upon them an infuſion of Rubarb and Senna, with Manna and Syrup of Roſes added to it.</p>
            <p>Afterwards 'twill be convenient to uſe <hi>Tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> or ſuch like Water.</p>
            <p>When the pain is violent, we muſt fly to Baths and <hi>Laudanum,</hi> with which Catharticks may be ſometimes given, but in a large Doſe,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57356:12"/>
becauſe the quality is much blunted by Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danun.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paracelſus</hi>'s <hi>Galbanetum,</hi> tho 'tis hot, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to diſcuſs the humour, if the whole Belly is anointed with it; the deſcription of it is above.</p>
            <p>Bleeding is ſometimes proper in this ſort of Colick, when there is danger, leſt the violence of the heat ſhould occaſion a Fever; but if there be a Fever already, 'tis preſently to be us'd.</p>
            <p>When there's a great drouth, Cold water muſt be given, according to <hi>Galen</hi>'s inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and <hi>Amalus Luſitanus</hi> ſays, he wonderfully Cur'd of a ſudden, ſuch a pain by the uſe of it; and <hi>Septalius</hi> declares in two Obſervations, that he us'd it inwardly and outwardly with great ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>For the Cure of a Colick that degenerates into a Palſie, put the Patient into a warm Bath, made of a Decoction of emollient things, the Belly being looſen'd with various Clyſters, and the firſt paſſages open'd by Catharticks. The Patient muſt be bath'd twice, thrice, or four or five times in a day, that the Acrimony of the Humours may be attemperated, and that the Pores of the Membranes may be open'd. The next day let the Humour be purg'd with ſome proper Cathartick, and then the Bath muſt be repeated; and ſo you muſt do every other day, if the Patient be able to bear it, till the humours being purg'd off, and the pain quieted, he is recover'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:57356:13"/>
In the mean while, you muſt continue the uſe of Clyſters; but thoſe made of Milk are beſt to aſſwage the pain; to which you may add Caſſia, Oyl of Violets, and Oyl of Lillies.</p>
            <p>Let the Belly be frequently anointed with Oyl of Chamomel, of Dill, ſweet Almonds, Lillies, and with Butter.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Uſe Whey and <hi>Tunbridge</hi>-waters, or the like: And if the Diſeaſe continue a long while, thoſe things may be uſed which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to Cure Hypocondrical Melancholy.</p>
            <p>And Bleeding is to be us'd at the beginning of the Diſeaſe, and before Purging, and to be often repeated, if the Bloud ſeem to be bad, or if ſomething of a Rheumatiſm ſeem to be join'd with it.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, All thoſe Remedies which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd for the Cure of the Bilious Colick, may be uſed in this caſe; and if theſe things do no good, ſome Phyſicians preſcribe the following Potion, which though it be loathſom, and won't go down with the delicate, yet they ſay it preſently mitigates the pain.</p>
            <p>Take of Horſe-Dung ℥ i, crumble it into ſmall pieces, and infuſe it in <abbr>lb</abbr>i of Erratic Poppy water, to which add viij or x Drops of Spirit of Wine; ſtram it gently, and divide it into Three Doſes, to be taken at the times in which the Pain is moſt violent.</p>
            <p>But if the Diſeaſe degenerate into a Palſie, you muſt uſe to the Spine of the Back, and the Paralitick Parts, ſome reſolvent Balſom, and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57356:13"/>
ſuch a one as ſtrengthens the Nerves if there be a Fever. But if there be no Fever, you may apply Wool dipt in Oyl or Ointment to the Paralitick parts, taking great care that the Patient does not catch cold, for by that means the Humour will be more fix'd upon the part, and the perſpiration of it will be hinder'd. <hi>Paracelſus</hi>'s <hi>Galbanetum</hi> is very uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in this caſe, if it be apply'd to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid parts, and alſo to the Navel.</p>

            <head>CHAP. II. Of the Bilious Colick of the Years <hi>1670, 71, 72.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IN all theſe Years the Blood was much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd to put off upon the Bowels Hot and Cholerick Humours, upon which account this Colick was more frequent than is uſual: The ſame Febrile Symptoms preceeded this Diſeaſe as us'd to go before the Dyſentery that reign'd in thoſe times; and ſometimes this Diſeaſe follow'd the Dyſentery, when it had a long while afflicted the Patient, and was juſt about to leave him. But when it did not follow a long Dyſentery, it generally took its riſe from a Fever, which after ſome Hours was wont to end in this Diſeaſe. It chiefly ſiez'd young People of a Hot and Cholerick Conſtitution,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57356:14"/>
eſpecially in the Summer. The pain of the Bowels was extreamly violent, and more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable than any other that afflicts poor Mortals. It ſometimes binds as it were the Guts, and ſometimes being contracted to a point, it bores like an Auger. The pain now and then remits, and preſently the Fit ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches again, which as ſoon as the Patient perceives, he looks ſadly, and bemoans him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as if 'twere actually upon him. At the beginning of this Diſeaſe, the pain is not ſo certainly determin'd to one point, as in the progreſs of it; neither is the Vomiting ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, neither does the Belly ſo obſtinately reſiſt Catharticks; but the more the pain is increas'd, the more pertinaciouſly is it fix'd in a point, the Vomiting is more frequent, and the Belly more bound, till at length by the dreadful force of theſe Symptoms, a total in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the Periſtaltick motion of the Guts, (if the Patient be not ſoon relieved,) and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence an Iliac Paſſion is procur'd; in which Diſeaſe all Purging Medicines become preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Emetick, and Clyſters that are injected, are vomited up with the Excrements. The Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that is caſt up after this Manner, if it be ſincere and without mixture, is ſometimes green, and ſometimes yellow, and ſometimes of an unuſual colour.</p>
            <p>Now ſeeing every <hi>Phaenômenon</hi> of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe ſhews plainly that it proceeds from ſome Acrid Humour, or Vapour put off by the Blood upon the Inteſtines; this in my Opinion is the chief curative Indication, namely, that
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57356:14"/>
the ſaid Humour ſhould be evacuated, as well that which is antecedently in the Veins, as that which is contain'd in the Guts; and the next to this is, that the force of the Humours tending thither<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhould be reſtrained by the uſe of Anodines<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that the violent pain ſhould be mitigated by them.</p>
            <p>Therefore I order that Blood ſhould be freely taken from the Arm, if no Blood has been taken away before; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<note place="margin">The Cure.</note> Two or Three Hours, I give an Anodine. The next day I preſcribe ſome gentle Purge, and to be repeated the next day ſave one, and ſometimes thrice, according as the Relicks of the Humour are more or leſs.</p>
            <p>But we muſt take notice, that if this Diſeaſe proceed from Eating too much Fruit, or from any Meat of hard Digeſtion, upon which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count ill and corrupted Juices are firſt tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Blood, and afterwards to the Bowels, I ſay in this caſe the Stomach muſt be waſh'd with large Draughts of Poſſet-Drink, which muſt be Vomited up again; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done, an Anodine is to be given, and the next day a Vein muſt be open'd; and as to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, you muſt proceed according to the Directions above-mention'd. But when the violence of the Pain, and the Vomiting (by reaſon of which the Guts are as it were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted) do reſiſt the operation of the Cathar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, they muſt be made ſtronger; for 'tis in vain to give a gentle Cathartick, unleſs the Patient is eaſily Purg'd, which muſt be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully enquir'd into; for ſuch a Medicine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57356:15"/>
not ſtrong enough to make its way through the Inteſtines, the Patient is more injur'd thereby; for by its ineffectual agitation, the Vomiting and the Pain is increaſed. A Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitive Cathartick Potion, of the infuſion of <hi>Tamarinds, of the Leaves of Senna and Rubarb,</hi> in which may be diſſolved <hi>Manna,</hi> and <hi>Syrup of Roſes,</hi> is to be preferr'd before other Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharticks, for it leaſt exagitates and moves the Humours. But if the Sick can't retain a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid Medicine, by reaſon of an averſion, or becauſe of the Vomiting, you muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily uſe Pills, among which the Pill Cochia pleaſes me beſt, for they paſs beſt through the Body in this and in moſt other caſes. But when the weakneſs of the Stomach, or the Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting is ſo great, that the Pills can't be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd, then I firſt order an Anodine, and a few Hours after a Purge; but there muſt be ſo much ſpace betwixt them, that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thartick be not quell'd by the Narcotick, and ſo render'd ineffectual; but that it may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſo long in the Stomach, as is neceſſary for its imparting its Purgative<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> quality to it, that it may operate when the virtue of the Narcotick is ſpent; though the Purge if it could be conveniently done, is beſt given a long while after the Anodine; for Twelve Hours after taking it, the Patient is difficultly Purg'd.</p>
            <p>But becauſe in this as well as in moſt other Diſeaſes, in which Narcoticks are indicated, a Purge always increaſes the Pain (at leaſt when it has done working, for while 'tis in
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57356:15"/>
operation, the Patient is not ſo ill,) therefore I uſually give an Anodine as ſoon as the Purge has done working, which I order to be taken Morning and Evening Daily, <hi>viz.</hi> In the middle ſpaces betwixt the Purges, that I may the more certainly appeaſe the Pain till the Patient has been ſufficiently Purg'd.</p>
            <p>The Purging of the Humours being over, I endeavour to bridle the fury of the Diſeaſe, (which now only remains to be done,) by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an Anodine conſtantly Morning and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening, which muſt be ſometimes repeated oftner; nor cou'd I ever take off violent pains, without a larger Doſe than is uſual, and that repeated too; for that which is ſufficient to vanquiſh another Diſeaſe, will be altogether inſufficient in this caſe, the violence of the Diſeaſe ſubduing the force of the Medicine: And 'tis indeed ſafe to repeat Narcoticks, while ſuch a pain as this continues violent, but not when 'tis gone off. Wherefore I repeat the Anodine according to the degree of the pain, till it ceaſes, or till it be very much leſſen'd; yet there muſt be ſuch a ſpace of time between them, that I may find what may be hop'd for from the former Doſe, before I give another: But for the moſt part, unleſs the pain be very violent, a Paregorick given Morning and Evening may be ſufficient. Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid Laudanum is the Anodine I chiefly uſe, of which I give Sixteen Drops in ſome Cordial Water, or the Doſe may be increas'd accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the violence of the Pain.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:57356:16"/>
This plain Method by which firſt the Pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant Matter is evacuated by Bleeding and Purging, and then eaſe procur'd by the help of Narcoticks, ſucceeded better in my practice, than any other I ever knew; whereas Carmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native Clyſters, injected in order to Extermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the Acrid Humours, do only ſtir the Coals, and render the Diſeaſe more laſting, by the tumult they raiſe in the Humours. But here I muſt admoniſh you, that though I have ſaid Bleeding and Purging muſt neceſſarily precede this quieting Method, yet ſometimes upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion both being omitted, you muſt begin with Anodines. For inſtance, when by reaſon of ſome preceding Sickneſs, large Evacuations have been us'd not long before the coming of the Colick, (for many times they who have recover'd of another Diſeaſe, have fell ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly into this, by reaſon of a weakneſs of the Bowels, eſpecially if there be a great degree of Heat, occaſion'd by drinking of Wine, or ſome other Spirituous Liquor immoderately,) I ſay in this caſe, 'tis not only unneceſſary, but I think 'tis injurious to give Catharticks again, for by them new Tumults will be rais'd. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over the Guts are moſt commonly ſufficiently cleans'd by Clyſters, frequently us'd before the Phyſician is advis'd with; ſo that partly for this cauſe, and partly by reaſon of the long continuance of the Diſeaſe, Narcoticks ſeem in a manner to be only uſeful.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1671, the Noble Baron <hi>Anneſly</hi> being afflicted with the Bilious Colick, with intolerable Pain, and frequent Vomiting
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57356:16"/>
for ſome Days, ſent for me to the Caſtle of <hi>Belvoir;</hi> he had try'd all ſorts of Clyſters and other Remedies, by the preſcription of Learn'd and Experienc'd Phyſicians living thereabout. I advis'd without any more adoe, the repeated uſe of Narcoticks, according to the Method juſt deliver'd, by which he recover'd in a few Days, and came to Town well with me.</p>
            <p>But becauſe this pain of its own nature is wont to return more than any other, all occaſions of its Relapſe muſt be prevented, by giving an Anodine twice a Day for ſome Days: But if as often as the Narcotick is intermitted, the pain now and then returns, as it ſometimes happens, I don't know any thing that will ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly perfect the Cure, as Riding on Horſe-back, or in a Coach, with which the Patient muſt take long Journies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in the mean while an Anodine muſt be given conſtantly Morning and Evening; for by this kind of Exerciſes, the Matter cauſing the Diſeaſe, is remov'd to the habit of the Body, and the Blood being broke into ſmall parts by perpetual agitation, is as it were depurated again, and at length the Inteſtines are much ſtrengthen'd and refreſh'd by this way of ſtirring up the natural Heat. Nor am I aſham'd to confeſs, that by the help of this Exerciſe, I have more than once per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly cur'd this Diſeaſe, when I was not able to cure it any other way; but this muſt not be us'd before the Patient has been well Purg'd, and then he muſt continue the uſe of it for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Days.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:57356:17"/>
One of my poor Neighbours who is now Living, was afflicted in theſe Years with a moſt violent Bilious Colick, who a long time endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd, but in vain, to conquer the Diſeaſe by Catharticks, Clyſters, and Leaden Bullets ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd down; I order'd him to uſe Narco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks frequently, which he did with good ſucceſs, for as often as he us'd them, he found himſelf very eaſie; but ſeeing the Diſeaſe was only palliated with theſe things and not extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated (for it return'd aſſoon as the vertue of the Narcotick was ſpent,) I took pity upon the Man, being grievouſly afflicted with this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe, and alſo with Poverty, and lent him one of my Horſes, that he might go a Journy as above directed, and having travelled a few Days, the Bowels grew ſo ſtrong, as to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſhake off the Relicks of the Diſeaſe, and ſo he perfectly recover'd, without the help of Anodines.</p>
            <p>And to ſpeak the truth, I have known this kind of Exerciſe has been always us'd with admirable ſucceſs in moſt other Chronical Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes, if the Patient continued it reſolutely. For if we conſider with our ſelves, that the lower Belly in which are plac'd the Organs of Secretion, are much ſhaken by this Exerciſe, perhaps ſome Thouſands of times in a Day, we ſhall eaſily believe that they are able by the help of the foreſaid Exerciſe, to ſhake off any Excrementitious Juice that is impacted there; and (which is of greater Moment yet,) that they are ſo corroborated by that power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful excitation of the native Heat, that they
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57356:17"/>
may duly perform that office of purifying the Blood which Nature has appointed them.</p>
            <p>If the Patient be Young, and of a Hot Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, I order a cooling and thickening Diet, ſuppoſe Pulp of Barly, Panada, and the like, and every third day if the Stomach is craving, a Chick, or a Whiting boyl'd. I allow no other Drink than Small-beer, or Milk-water: And this is all I order, unleſs Riding neceſſary to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Health, requires more nouriſhing Food, and more generous Liquor, by which the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits exhauſted by Exerciſe may be repair'd.</p>
            <p>But when the Diſeaſe being unskilfully treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed has a long while afflicted the Patient, ſo that the Bowels become weak and infirm, and he is in a manner quite waſted, I ſay in this caſe we find by experience, that the free uſe of Epide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick Water, or of Aq. Mirabilis, or of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Patient likes beſt, relieves him at this time beyond expectation; for by this means the ſmall Relicks of the Native Heat and the Spirits will be excited, and the preternatural ferment ſticking to the Bowels, and now and then occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioning new Fits, will be extinguiſh'd by Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Liquors.</p>
            <p>Moreover as in the cure of the Diſeaſe, ſo when 'tis over, the thin Diet we have mention'd muſt be obſerv'd for ſome time; for this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe being more apt to return than any other, and ſeating it ſelf upon the principle parts for Concoction (I mean the Bowels already weaken'd by it) the leaſt error of this kind will preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly occaſion much pain. Wherefore in this and all other Diſeaſes of the Bowels, Meats of hard
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57356:18"/>
Digeſtion are carefully to be avoided, and things of eaſie Digeſtion muſt be taken only in ſuch a quantity as will ſuffice to ſuſtain Life.</p>
            <p>A certain kind of Hyſterical Diſeaſe afflicts ſome Women, very like the Bilious<note place="margin">The Hyſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick Colick.</note> Colick, both as to the ſharpneſs and ſituation of the Pain, and alſo upon the account of the Humours ejected by Vomit, of a Yellow and Green Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour: I will treat of it by the by, leſt any one ſhould take it for the bilious Colick juſt now mention'd.</p>
            <p>Thoſe Women that are of a laxe and crude habit of Body, are chiefly afflicted with this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe, and they that have lately labour'd under ſome other Hyſterick indiſpoſition, (or which is very often) thoſe that have ſcarce evaded a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult and hard Labour, in bringing forth a large Child, whereby the Mothers Nature and Strength has been almoſt ſpent. A pain as violent almoſt as that of the Colick or Iliack Paſſion, ſeizes the region of the Stomach; and ſometimes it comes a little lower, and then violent Vomitings fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and the Matter which is caſt up, is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Yellow, and ſometimes Green; and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over (which I have often obſerv'd,) there's a greater dejection of Spirit and deſperation than in any other Diſeaſe whatever. After a Day or Two the pain goes off, and returns again a few Weeks after as violent as 'twas before. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times 'tis accompanied with the Jaundice, which is very viſible, and which goes off of its own accord in a few Days. When all the Symptoms are gone off, and when the Patient ſeems very
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57356:18"/>
well, the ſmalleſt diſorder of the Mind, whether it be occaſion'd by Anger or Sorrow (to both which in this caſe Women are very prone,) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt recalls the pain, which may be ſaid of Walking or any other Exerciſe us'd too ſoon; for by theſe means Vapours are elevated in a laxe and weak habit of Body. When according to the vulgar Opinion, I ſay, Vapours, whether they be ſo or no, or whether they are convulſions of particular parts, the Phaenomena may be ſolved either way. Theſe Vapours or Convulſions when they invade this or that region of the Body, produce Symptoms agreeable to the part they invade; and though they are one and the ſame Diſeaſe every where, yet they cunningly reſemble moſt of the Diſeaſes Mankind is expos'd to, which is manifeſt from this Symptom, which when it ſeizes upon the parts near the Colon, imitates exactly the Bilious Colick, which is alſo as apparent in many other parts of the Body af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with this Diſeaſe. For inſtance, Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it ſeizes one of the Kidneys with a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent pain, from whence ariſes violent Vomiting, and being oftentimes convey'd by the paſſage of the Ureter, it reſembles the Stone; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exaſperated by Clyſters and other Lithon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triptick Medicines deſign'd to force away the Stone, it afflicts the Patient in the ſame manner a long while, and ſometimes (contrary to its nature, for left to it ſelf, 'tis no way dangerous) kills the Patient. I have ſeen moreover Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms occaſion'd by it, exactly reſembling the Stone in the Bladder. Not long agoe I was call'd up in the Night to viſit a Counteſs, my
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57356:19"/>
Neighbour, ſeiz'd ſuddenly with a violent pain in the region of the Bladder, and with a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of Urine; and having known that ſhe was ſubject to various Hyſterick Indiſpoſitions, I ſuppos'd the Diſeaſe was not that they imagin'd, and therefore I would not ſuffer a Clyſter that her Maid had prepared to be injected, leſt the Diſeaſe ſhould be increas'd thereby; and inſtead of this and Emollients, namely <hi>Syrup of Marſh Mallows</hi> and the like, which the Apothecary had brought, I order'd a Narcotick, which ſoon took off that Symptom. And indeed there is not one part of the Body wholly ſecur'd from the aſſaults of this Diſeaſe, whether they are internal or external, as the Jaws, Hips and Legs; in all which it excites violent pain, and when it goes off, leaves a tenderneſs behind, which will not bear touching, juſt as if the Fleſh was bruis'd with violent Strokes.</p>
            <p>But now ſeeing I have deliver'd ſome things by the by, appertaining to the Hiſtory of the Hyſterick Colick, leſt it ſhould be miſtaken for the Bilious Colick, I will tranſiently<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>touch upon ſome things relating to the cure of the Symptom of pain which accompanies it. For the perfect Cure which takes off the Diſeaſe, by removing the cauſe, comes under another Speculation, and belongs to another place.</p>
            <p>Bleeding and Purging repeated, which are plainly indicated at the beginning of a Bilious Colick, are not to be uſed here, unleſs in the caſe to be mention'd by and by; for experience teaches, that the pain is exaſperated, and that all the Symptoms increaſe by reaſon of the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57356:19"/>
which thoſe things occaſion; and I have more than once obſerv'd, that the repetition of the gentleſt Clyſters have brought on a long ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Symptoms. And reaſon as well as expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience dictates, that this Diſeaſe is rather pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by an inordinate motion of the Spirits, than by vicious Humours, if we conſider what things moſt commonly occaſion it; and they are ſuch as theſe, large and unneceſſary profuſions of Blood, violent motions of the Mind and Body, and ſuch like: All which forbid thoſe Remedies by which a greater diſturbance of the Spirits may be occaſion'd; and inſtead of them Anodines are to be us'd, though the green and ill colour of the Matter vomited up may ſeem to indicate the contrary; for the ſpeculation of colours is too nice to authorize thoſe Evacuations, which we find <hi>ipſo facto</hi> injurious. And I don't at all doubt that this Diſeaſe (which though it occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion violent pain, is no way Mortal,) has prov'd deadly by reaſon of Errors committed upon the belief of ſuch Speculations. Moreover if any one ſhould give the ſtrongeſt Vomit to Day, to eject that which he ſuppoſes to be the occaſion of the Diſeaſe, yet the next Day the Patient would vomit up Matter quite as green or of ſome other ill colour, as was the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
            <p>But we muſt take notice, that there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſo great a quantity of Blood and Humours which ſo reſiſts the operation of the Narcotick, that though it be often repeated, it can't quell the tumult, till the Patient is Blooded and Purg'd, which I have obſerv'd in Women of a
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57356:20"/>
very Sanguine Conſtitution, and in Virago's. If the caſe is ſo, Bleeding or Purging, or perchance both, muſt make way for the Anodine; for ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe being us'd, a moderate Doſe of the Narcotick will perform the buſineſs, which otherwiſe would ſignifie nothing, though the largeſt Doſe was given: But this ſeldom hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, and then theſe Remedies muſt not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated; and when they are us'd when there is need of them, you muſt proceed in giving Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines in that Method which I have propos'd in the Bilious Colick, and they muſt be taken often or ſeldom, according to the degrees of pain. Which Method indeed reſpects only the Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of violent pain; for I don't now undertake to treat of that Method which takes off the cauſe. But for as much as this Diſeaſe in Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocondriacal as well as Hyſterical People, (for the reaſon is the ſame in both, as is ſaid in another place,) often ends in the Jaundice, and as this comes on, ſo that goes off; we muſt take notice, that in curing this kind of Jaundice, all Catharticks are either wholly to be omitted, or if they are given, you muſt uſe only<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Rubarb or ſome other gentle Purge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for there's danger leſt by Purging, new Tumults ſhould ariſe, and ſo all the Symptoms return. And therefore in this caſe, nothing muſt be done preſently, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Jaundice taking its riſe on this account, generally leſſens of its own accord, and wholly vaniſhes in a ſhort time; but if it continues a long while, and ſeems to go off difficulty, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies muſt be taken for it: I uſe the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:57356:20"/>
Take of the Roots of Madder, of Curcuma, each ℥i, of all the greater Celandine, and of the tops of the leſſer Centauris, each <hi>M</hi> i; boil them in equal parts of Rheniſh Wine, and of Fountain Water, to <abbr>lb</abbr> ij, in the ſtraining Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve ℥ij of the Syrup de quinq. Radicibus, mingle them, make an Apozem; let the Patient take <abbr>lb</abbr>ſs Morning and Evening, till he's well.</p>
            <p>But if the Jaundice comes of it ſelf, the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick not going before, 'tis neceſſary beſides the alteratives juſt mentioned, to give Cholagoges, that is, ſuch things as purge Choler by Stool, namely once or twice before the Patient enters upon the Apozem preſcrib'd, and afterwards once a Week as long as he takes it.</p>
            <p>As take of the Electuary of the Juice of Roſes <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ij, of Rubarb finely Powder'd <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ſs, of Cream of Tartar ℈i, make a Bolus with a ſufficient quantity of Syrup of Rubarb, with Cichory; give it early in the Morning, and let the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient drink upon it a ſmall Draught of Rheniſh Wine.</p>
            <p>But if notwithſtanding the conſtant taking of theſe things a long while, the Diſeaſe continues obſtinate, the Patient muſt drink <hi>Tunbridge</hi> Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or ſuch like, from the Fountain every Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 'till he recovers.</p>

            <head>CHAP. III. Of the Hyſterick Diſeaſe.</head>
            <p>THIS Diſeaſe if I calculate right, is the moſt frequent of all Chronical Diſeaſes, and as Fevers with thoſe Diſeaſes that appertain to them, if they are compar'd with Chronical taken all together make two Thirds, ſo Hyſterical Diſeaſes (at leaſt thoſe that go under that Name,) are half the remaining Third; that is, Chronical Diſeaſes are half Hyſterick, for very few Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men (which Sex contains the half of grown Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) are wholly free from all kinds of Hyſterick Diſeaſes, if you except thoſe who being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to labour, live hardly. Yea, many of thoſe Men that live ſedentary Lives, and are wont to Study hard, are afflicted with the ſame Diſeaſe. And though heretofore Hyſterical Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms were always reckon'd to proceed from a vitious Womb, yet if we compare Hypocondriacal Symptoms which we are ſuppoſed to proceed from obſtructions of the Spleen or Bowels, or from ſome other I know not what Obſtructions, with Womens Hyſterick Symptoms, an Egg is ſcarce more like an Egg, than theſe Symptoms are one another in all reſpects. But it muſt be confeſs'd that Women, are much more ſubject to this kind of Diſeaſe than Men, not for that the Womb is more faulty than any other region of the Body, but for cauſes to be ſhewn by and by.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:57356:21"/>
Nor is this Diſeaſe only frequent, but ſo won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully various, that it reſembles almoſt all the Diſeaſes poor Mortals are ſubject to, for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever part it ſeats it ſelf in, it preſently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces ſuch Symptoms as appertain to it; and unleſs the Phyſician is very ſagacious and very skilful, he will be miſtaken, and ſuppoſe that thoſe Symptoms proceed from ſome eſſential Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe of this or that part, and not from an Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterical Diſtemper.</p>
            <p>Sometimes for inſtance, it poſſeſſes the Head, and occaſions an Apoplexy, which alſo ends in an Hemiplegy, and is exactly like that Apoplexy by which Corpulent and Antient People are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd, and which happens by reaſon the paſſages of the Animal Spirits are ſtopt, the Cortex of the Brain being ſtuffed by a great deal of Phlegm, from which cauſe the Apoplexy that happens to Hyſterical Women, does no way ſeem to ariſe, for it ſeizes ſuch very often preſently after de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery, a great quantity of Blood being at the ſame time evacuated, or it's occaſion'd by hard Labour, or ſome violent commotion of the Mind.</p>
            <p>Sometimes it produces violent Convulſions, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry like an Epilepſie, the Belly and Bowels ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling towards the Throat, the Patient ſtrugling ſo violently, that though at other times her ſtrength is but ordinary, ſhe now can ſcarce be held by all the ſtrength of the by Standers, ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering ſome odd and inarticulate ſounds, and ſtriking her Breaſt. Women who are accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom'd to this Diſeaſe, commonly call'd Mother Fits, are generally extraordinary Sanguine, and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57356:22"/>
have an habit of Body almoſt like that of a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rago.</p>
            <p>Sometimes it poſſeſſes the outward part of the Head betwixt the Pericranium and Skull, cauſing violent pain continually fix'd in one part, which may be cover'd with the top of your Thumb; and violent Vomiting accompanies this pain. I call this Species, <hi>Clavus Hyſtericus,</hi> chiefly afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe that have a Chloroſis.</p>
            <p>Sometimes falling upon the Vital parts, it oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions ſo great a palpitation of the Heart, that the Women who are afflicted with it may verily believe that the by Standers may hear the ſound of the heart thumping upon the Ribs; this kind chiefly afflicts thoſe that are of a thin habit of Body, and of a weak Conſtitution, and who look almoſt tabid; and alſo Young Maids that have the Green Sickneſs.</p>
            <p>Sometimes it ſeizes the Lungs, and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient coughs almoſt without intermiſſion, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectorates nothing; and though this ſort of Cough don't ſhake the Breaſt ſo violently as that which is Convulſive, yet the Exploſions are much more frequent: But this kind of Hyſterick Cough is very rare, and chiefly invades Women that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound with Phlegm.</p>
            <p>Sometimes ruſhing violently upon the Colon, and the region under the <hi>Scrobiculum Cordis,</hi> it occaſions violent Pain, much like the Iliac Paſſion, and the Woman Vomits exceedingly, ejecting a certain green Matter, ſomewhat like that they call <hi>Porraceous Bile,</hi> and ſometimes of an unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual colour. And often after the Sick has been almoſt deſtroy'd by the ſaid Pain, (which would
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:57356:22"/>
tire a Stoical Apathy,) and reachings to Vomit for many Days, at length the Fit is carried off by the Jaundice, tincturing the Superficies of the Body like Saffron. Moreover the Sick is oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by an anguiſh of Mind, and wholly deſpairs of Recovery, with dejection of Mind, and as it were a certain Deſparation which as certainly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies (as I have obſerv'd) this kind of Hyſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick Diſeaſes, as the Pain and Vomiting above mention'd. This kind chiefly invades thoſe that are of a Laxe and Crude habit of Body, and thoſe that have ſuffer'd much in bringing forth great Children. When this Diſeaſe falls upon one of the Kidneys, it plainly repreſents by the pain it cauſes there, a Nephritick Paroxiſm, and not only by that ſort of Pain, and by the place it rages in, but alſo by violent Vomitings, which accompany it, and alſo for that ſometimes the pain extends it ſelf through the paſſage of the Ureter; ſo that 'tis very difficult to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe Symptoms proceed from the Stone, or from ſome Hyſterick Diſeaſe, unleſs perchance ſome unlucky accident diſturbing the Womans Mind a little before ſhe was taken ill, or the Vomiting of green Matter, ſhews that the Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms rather proceed from an Hyſterick Diſeaſe, than from the Stone. Neither is the Bladder free from this falſe Symptom, for it does not only cauſe Pain there, but it alſo ſtops the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, juſt as if there were a Stone, whereas there is none. But this laſt kind ſeizing the Bladder, happens very ſeldom; but that which reſembles the Stone in the Kidnies is not ſo rare: Both us'd to invade thoſe Women who are much
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57356:23"/>
weaken'd by Hyſterick Fits coming frequently<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and whoſe health of Body is much impair'd.</p>
            <p>Sometimes falling upon the Stomach, it cauſes continual Vomiting, and ſometimes a Diarrhaea, when 'tis ſetled upon the Guts; but no pain ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies either of thoſe Symptoms, tho of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes in both, that green Humour appears: Both theſe kinds are familiar with thoſe that are much weaken'd by Hyſterick Fits coming fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently.</p>
            <p>And as this Diſeaſe afflicts almoſt all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards parts, ſo ſometimes it alſo ſeizes the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts, and the Muſculous Fleſh, occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pain, and ſometimes a tumour in the Jaws, Shoulders, Hands, Thighs and Legs, in which kind that tumour which ſwells the Legs is more conſpicuous than the reſt; but whereas in Hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical Tumours theſe Two things may be always taken notice of, namely, that the Swelling is moſt in the Evening, and that the Finger preſs'd upon it, leaves a Pit. In this tumour the Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is moſt in the Morning, neither does it yield to the Finger, or leave any Mark behind it; and for the moſt part it only ſwells one of the Legs. As to other things, if you mind the largeneſs of it, or its ſuperficies, 'tis ſo very like Hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical Swellings, that the Patient can ſcarce be brought to believe 'tis any other Diſeaſe. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can the Teeth free themſelves from the aſſaults of this Diſeaſe, though they are not hollow, and though there's no apparent defluxion that may occaſion the pain, yet is it no whit gentler, nor ſhorter, nor eaſier cured. But thoſe pains and tumours which afflict the outward parts,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57356:23"/>
chiefly ſeize thoſe Women that are in a manner quite deſtroy'd by a long ſeries of Hyſterick Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxiſms, and by the force of them.</p>
            <p>But among all the torments of this Diſeaſe, there's none ſo common as a pain in the Back, which moſt certainly all feel, how little ſoever they are afflicted with this Diſeaſe. Moreover this is common to the foreſaid Pains, that the place on which they were, will not bear touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after they are gone, but is tender, and akes, juſt as if 'twere ſoundly beaten; but this tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs goes off by degrees.</p>
            <p>And this is worth obſerving, that often a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table cold of the External parts, makes way for theſe Symptoms, which for the moſt part does not go off till the Fit ends; which Cold I have obſerv'd is almoſt like that by which a Carkas grows ſtiff, yet the Pulſe are good.</p>
            <p>And moreover, almoſt all Hyſterick Women which I have hitherto taken care of, complain of a dejection and ſinking of the Spirits; and when they wou'd ſhew the place where this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction or ſinking of the Spirits is, they point to the region of the Lungs.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Every one knows that Hyſterick Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſometimes Laugh exceſſively, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Cry as much, without any real cauſe for either.</p>
            <p>But among all the Symptoms that accompany this Diſeaſe, this is the moſt proper, and almoſt inſeparable, namely a Urine as clear as Rock Water; and this Hyſterick Women evacuate plentifully, which I find by diligent inquiry, is in almoſt all the Pathognomonic ſign of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57356:24"/>
which we call Hyſterick in Women, and Hypocondriack in Men; and I have ſometimes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd in Men, that preſently after making Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a Citron colour, (yea almoſt the next mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) being ſuddenly ſeized with ſome violent commotion of the Mind, they preſently make Water as clear as Cryſtal, and in a great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, with a continued violent Stream, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ill 'till the Urine comes to its wonted Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and then the Fit goes off.</p>
            <p>And it happens to all Hyſterical and Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condriacal People, that ſometimes they belch up ill Fumes as often as they eat, though they eat only moderately, and according as they have an Appetite; and ſometimes the Wind that comes from the Stomach is ſour, juſt like Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar when it comes into the Mouth, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction being much impair'd, and the Juices quite differing from their natural ſtate.</p>
            <p>Neither are they unhappy upon this account only, <hi>viz.</hi> that their Bodies are ſo ill affected, and as it were tottering like ruinated Houſes juſt about to fall; for their Minds are more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed than their Bodies, for an incurable Deſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is mix'd with the very nature of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe; they are in a great rage when any one ſpeaks never ſo little of the hopes he has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of their Recovery, eaſily believing that they ſuffer all the miſeries that can befal a Man, foreboding the moſt dreadful things to themſelves, entertaining in their reſtleſs and anxious Breaſts upon a ſlight occaſion, or perhaps for none at all, Fear, Anger, Jealouſie, Suſpicions, and worſe Paſſions of the Mind if any can be worſe, abhoring
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57356:24"/>
all Joy, Hope and Mirth, and if any one of theſe do chance to occur, 'tis <hi>rara Avis,</hi> and ſoon flies away, and does no leſs exagitate the Mind, than the ſorrowful Paſſions; ſo that they never obſerve a mean, conſtant only to inconſtancy: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they love beyond meaſure, and preſently hate the ſame without any cauſe; ſometimes they deſign to do this or that, then preſently alter their Intentions, and begin the quite contrary, and yet they don't perform that neither; ſo wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering are they, that their Minds can't be at all at reſt; and that which the Roman Orator ſaid of the Superſtitious, exactly agrees with theſe Melancholy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> People<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Sleep</hi> (ſays he) <hi>ſeems to be a refuge for the Laborious and careful, but from thence cares and fears ariſe.</hi> Whilſt only Funerals and Apparitions of their Deceas'd Friends are repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in Dreams, and they are ſo tormented in Body and Mind, that one would think their Lives were a Purgatory, in which they were to puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie themſelves, and to expiate Crimes committed in ſome other ſtate. Nor does this happen only to Mad People, but alſo to thoſe who if you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept theſe impetuoſities of Mind, are very Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and Judicious<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and who much excel for deep Thought and wiſdom in Speech, others whoſe Minds were never excited by theſe Provokements to thinking, ſo that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> was much in the right, when he ſaid Melancholy People are moſt ingenious.</p>
            <p>But this dreadful condition of the Mind which we have above deſcrib'd, ſeizes on thoſe only that have much and a long while conflicted with this Diſeaſe, and have been at length wholly
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57356:25"/>
vanquiſh'd by it, eſpecially if Adverſity, Care or Trouble of Mind, or hard Study or the like, joyn'd with an ill habit of Body, have added Oyl to the Flame.</p>
            <p>A day would ſcarce be ſufficient to reckon up all the Symptoms belonging to Hyſterick Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ſo various are they, and ſo contrary one to the other, that <hi>Proteus</hi> had not more ſhapes, nor the Chamelion greater variety of colours: And I think <hi>Democritus</hi> reckon'd pretty right (though he miſtook the cauſe of the Diſeaſe,) when he ſaid in an Epiſtle to <hi>Hippocrates, that the Womb was the cauſe of Six Hundred Miſeries, and of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Calamities.</hi> Nor are they only very various, but alſo ſo irregular, that they can't be contain'd under any uniform type, which is uſual in other Diſeaſes, for they are as it were a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly heap of Phaenomena, ſo that 'tis very difficult to write the Hiſtory of this Diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>The procatartick or external cauſes of this Diſeaſe, are either violent motions of the Body, or which is much oftner, vehement commotions of the Mind from ſome ſudden aſſault, either of Anger or Grief or the like Paſſions; therefore as often as Women adviſe with me about this or that diſorder of Body, the reaſon of which can't be deduc'd from the common Axioms, for find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out Diſeaſes, I always diligently inquire of them whether they are not chiefly afflicted with that indiſpoſition which they complain of when they have been diſturb'd in their Minds and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with Grief, which if they confeſs, I am ſufficiently ſatisfied that the Diſeaſe muſt come under this Tribe we are now ſpeaking of, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57356:25"/>
if Urine as clear as Chryſtal evacuated copiouſly at ſome certain times, makes the diag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſtick more manifeſt. But to theſe diſorders of the mind which are uſually the occaſions of this Diſeaſe, is to be added emptineſs of the Stomach by reaſon of long faſting, immoderate bleeding, and a Vomit or a Purge that work'd too much. Now having drawn the Picture of this Diſeaſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its moſt vulgar <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> in the next place its internal efficient cauſes are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd, as well as we can gather them from all the circumſtances join'd together, which we have deſcrib'd: And in my opinion thoſe Diſeaſes which we call hyſterical in Women, and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondriacal in Men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> proceed from a confuſion of the Spirits, upon which account, too many of them in a croud contrary to proportion, are hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd violently upon this or that part, occaſioning Convulſions and pain, when they ruſh upon parts endued with exquiſite Senſe, perverting the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the Organs, both of that, into which they thruſt themſelves, and alſo of that from whence they departed; both being much injur'd by this unequal diſtribution, which is quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the oeconomy of Nature.</p>
            <p>The origine and antecedent cauſe of this <hi>Ataxy,</hi> is a weak conſtitution of the ſaid Spirits, whether it's natural or adventitious; for which reaſon, they are eaſily diſſipated upon any occaſion, and their Syſtem ſoon broke. For as the outward man is fram'd with parts obvious to Senſe, ſo without doubt the inward man conſiſts of a due Series, and as it were a Fabric of the Spirits, to be view'd only by the eye of Reaſon; and as this is
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57356:26"/>
nearly join'd, and as it were, united with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Body, ſo much the more eaſily or more difficultly is its frame diſordered, by how much the conſtitutive Principles that are allotted us by nature, are more or leſs firm: Wherefore this Diſeaſe ſeizes many more Women than Men, becauſe kind Nature has given them a more deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and fine habit of Body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> having deſign'd them only for an eaſie life, and to perform the tender Offices of Love: But ſhe gave Men robuſt Bodies that they might be able to delve and manure the Earth, to kill Wild Beaſts for Food, and the like.</p>
            <p>But that the ſaid confuſion of the Spirits is the cauſe of this Diſeaſe, the Phaenomena now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd, will ſufficiently prove; the chief of which I will only mention. And I begin with Mother-Fits, here the Spirits are crouded in the lower Belly, and ruſhing together violently towards the Jaws, occaſion Convulſions in every Region through which they paſs, blowing up the Belly like a great Ball; which yet is nothing but the rowling together, or conglobation of the parts ſeiz'd with the Convulſion, which can't be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd without great violence. The external parts in the mean while, and the Fleſh being in a manner deſtitute of Spirits, by reaſon they are carried another way, are often ſo very cold, not only in this kind, but in all other kinds of hyſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric Diſeaſes (as was noted above) that dead Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are not colder. But the Pulſe are as good as thoſe of People that are well; nor is the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans life in danger by this Cold, unleſs 'tis occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd by ſome very large evacuation going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:57356:26"/>
The ſame may be ſaid of that violent hyſteric Diſeaſe, which to outward appearance is like the bilious Colick or the iliack Paſſion, in which the Woman is ſeized with a violent pain in the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, about the <hi>Scrobiculum cordis,</hi> together with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent Vomiting, by which a matter is caſt up, in colour like Herbs, which Symptom I ſuppoſe, proceeds only from a vehement impulſe of the Spirits crouded together in the ſaid parts, which occaſions the Convulſion and pain, and the total ſubverſion of all the Faculties. Nor is it to be preſently concluded that this Diſeaſe reſides in the Humours, becauſe thoſe things that are evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated upward or downward, are ſometimes of a green colour, or that the violent pain is occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd by the acrimony of ſome Humour tearing the part it adheres to, which for that cauſe, we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the occaſion of the Diſeaſe, and therefore ſuppoſe it ought to be eradicated by Vomits and Purges; for 'tis manifeſt that the Sickneſs which ſeizes People that go to Sea, (ariſing from the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation of the animal Spirits in the boiſterous Sea) occaſions the vomiting up of matter as green as an Herb, from the Stomacks of thoſe that are in perfect health<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when they firſt go to Sea, and are a good way from Land; in whom, half an hour before, there was none of that Choler which is call'd <hi>porraceous.</hi> And don't Infants in convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Fits in which the animal Spirits are chiefly concern'd, evacuate upward or downward, mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the ſame colour, to which muſt be added that which almoſt daily experience teaches, <hi>viz.</hi> that tho' ſuch Women and Children ſhou'd be quite exhauſted by repeated Purges, yet the ſaid
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57356:27"/>
colour wou'd ſtill appear in that which they evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate by Vomit or Stool; yea, the green matter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes by the frequent uſe of cathartick and eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Medicines, becauſe by both, the confuſion of the Spirits is heightned, which I know not how either deſtroys or Perverts the ferment of thoſe parts, or throws into the Stomach or Guts, by the force of the Convulſions, ſome juice of a ſtrange nature, which is diſpos'd to give the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours ſuch a Tincture. And tho' Chymiſts are not ſo happy as to prepare better Medicines in their fruitful Glaſs, than are made in a Mortar or a Pipkin, yet they know how to pleaſe the vain Humour of the Curious, by ſhewing two Liquors equally limpid and clear, which being mixt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, preſently change into ſome deep colour, as if there was conjuring in the caſe. And truly the ſpeculation of colours is ſo uncertain and vain, that we can learn nothing certainly from them, concerning the nature of the Bodies they appear in; nor does it more neceſſarily follow, that thoſe things which are of a green colour ſhou'd be acrid, than that all acrid things ſhou'd be green. The thing therefore being throughly conſider'd, it will plainly appear, that the violent pain which almoſt deſtroys thoſe that are afflicted with the hyſterick Colick, and the evacuation of green matter, are wholly occaſion'd by the Spirits ruſhing impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly upon the parts about the <hi>Scrobiculum cordis,</hi> and contracting the ſame by Convulſions.</p>
            <p>That Symptom which I term'd above <hi>clavus hyſtericus,</hi> is to be attributed to this enormity of the Spirits, in which the Spirits in all the compaſs of the Body, are as it were concentrated in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cain
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:57356:27"/>
point of the <hi>Pericranium,</hi> occaſioning a pain, boring as it were through; juſt as if a Nail was driven in to the Head, together with violent vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting and caſting up of green matter, which Contraction indeed, of all the Spirits of the Body as i were to a Point, is ſomewhat like that Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of the Raies of the Sun, which is made by a burning Glaſs: And as the force of theſe united, burns, ſo they for the ſame reaſon occaſion pain, by tearing the membranes with their forces joind.</p>
            <p>And then from that inordinate agitation of the Spirits diſturbing the Blood, ariſes that Symptom, which as we have mention'd above, is frequent in hyſterical and hypochondriacal People, <hi>viz.</hi> clear, limpid and copious Urine: For when the oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of the Blood is interrupted, the Sick can't long enough contain the Serum that is imported, but lets it go before it's impregnated with ſaline par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, by which the citron colour is to be impart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to it; whereof we have a daily experiment in thoſe that drink much, eſpecially of thin and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuating Liquors, for then their Urine is very clear, in which caſe the blood being overpower'd by that quantity of Serum, and being wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to retain it, puts it off quite clear, not yet dy'd by the juices of the Body, by reaſon of its too ſhort ſtay.</p>
            <p>Three years ago a Nobleman ſent for me, he ſeem'd to labour under an hypochondriack Colick, that was almoſt come to an iliack Paſſion, with pain and violent vomiting, with which he was much and a long while afflicted and almoſt worn out: I obſerv'd through the whole courſe of the Diſeaſe, that when he was worſt his Urine was
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:57356:28"/>
always clear, but when he was a little better it was ſomewhat of a citron colour. Viſiting him one day, I view'd his Urine made at three times, kept apart in three Chamber-pots, of a citron colour; he was then merry and chearful, and thinking of eating ſome meat of eaſie Digeſtion, and he ſaid he had a craving Appetite; but one coming in at that very moment, who vext him ſo much, that ſuddenly growing ill, he call'd for a Chamber-pot, which he almoſt fill'd with Urine as clear as Chryſtal.</p>
            <p>And perhaps that ſpitting which is common in hyſterical Women, proceeds from the Spirits ſo diſturbing the blood; they ſpit thin for many Weeks, juſt as if they were ſalivated by unction; for during this diſturb'd condition of the blood, in which 'tis unable to perform evacuations ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Natures method, the Serum by chance taking this contrary courſe, is not evacuated ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rules of Nature by the Reins, but is put off by the extremities of the Arteries upon the Glands, and ſo comes forth by the ſalivary paſſages in the form of Spittle. The ſame may be ſaid of thoſe violent nocturnal Sweats which afflict hyſterical Women, which proceed from no other cauſe than the ill diſpoſition of the Serum of the blood, by which 'tis inclin'd to be put off upon the habit of the Body.</p>
            <p>As to the cold by which the external parts are ſo often chill'd in hyſterical Diſeaſes, 'tis very manifeſt that that happens becauſe the Spirits for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking their Stations, too officiouſly intrude them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into this or that part; nor is it to be doubted that weeping and laughing Fits, which
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57356:28"/>
often ſeize hyſterical Women withou any occaſion, are procured by the animal Spirits forcing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves violently upon the Organs, that perform theſe animal Functions.</p>
            <p>And by the by, Men are alſo ſubject (tho' rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) to Fits of weeping. I was ſent for ſometime ago to an ingenious Gentleman, who but a few days before, recover'd of a Fever; he made uſe of another Phyſician, who blooded him and purg'd him thrice, and forbid him to eat Fleſh: When I came and ſaw him with his cloaths on, and heard him diſcourſe judiciouſly, I ask'd to what purpoſe I was ſent for? One of his friends anſwer'd, if I wou'd have a little patience I ſhould ſee; ſitting down therefore, and diſcourſing with him, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently obſerv'd that his lower Lip was thruſt out, and mov'd frequently (as froward Children us'd to do to prepare for crying) and then wept ſo vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently, that I ſcarce ever ſaw the like; with ſuch deep ſighs as were almoſt convulſive: Which ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain Torrent in a little time quite aſſwag'd. I ſuppoſed that this diſorder proceeded from a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of the Spirits, which was occaſion'd partly by the long continuance of the Diſeaſe, and partly by evacuations which the method of cure neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily requir'd; and partly alſo from emptineſs and abſtinence from Fleſh; which the Phyſician or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd for ſome days after he was well, to ſecure him from a Relaps. But I affirm'd he was clear from all danger of a Fever, and that the foreſaid Symptom was wholly occaſion'd by emptineſs, and therefore I advis'd, that a roaſted Chick ſhou'd be provided for his Dinner, and that he ſhou'd drink Wine moderately<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which being done, and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57356:29"/>
again to the eating of Fleſh moderately, was never afterwards troubl'd with this convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive weeping.</p>
            <p>And now at length to come to a concluſion, (for I omit other Phaenomena which belong to this Diſeaſe) that diſturbance and varying Intemperies both of Body and Mind, which prevails over hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterical and hypochondriacal People, is occaſion'd by this inordination of the Spirits; for in both, that firmneſs of Spirits being wanting, which is always found in the robuſt, and in thoſe who are continually invigorated by the aſſiſtance of brisk Spirits, they can't bear the impreſſions of croſs accidents, but are ſoon mov'd by anger or pain, and are as apt to be angry, as thoſe to whom ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nature has given a ſoft and weak Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Mind, or when it has been render'd ſo by a long ſeries or continuance of Diſeaſes. For the ſtrength and conſtancy of mind as long as 'tis confin'd in the Body, much depends on the firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Spirits that are ſubſervient to it; which indeed, are made of the fineſt matter, and are plac'd in the confines of immaterial entities; and as the frame of the mind, if it's lawful to call it ſo, is much more curious and delicate, than the ſtructure of the Body, for it conſiſts in the harmony of the moſt excellent and almoſt divine Faculties; ſo if its conſtitution is any way ſpoil'd, by ſo much the greater is the ruin, by how much 'twas more excellent and more exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitely compos'd when 'twas whole. And this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is the condition of theſe miſerable and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected People we have deſcrib'd, for which Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, ſome obſtinate Decree of the moſt inſolent
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57356:29"/>
Stoick wou'd give no greater eaſe, than he that wou'd prevent the Tooth-ach, by firmly reſolving that he wou'd not by any means ſuffer his Teeth to ake.</p>
            <p>And now I ſuppoſe that 'tis manifeſt that this whole Diſeaſe is occaſion'd by the animal Spirits being not rightly diſpos'd, and not by Seed and menſtruous Blood corrupted, (as ſome Authors aſſert) and ſending up malignant Vapours to the parts affected; nor from I know not what depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Juices or Congeſtion of acrid Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours as others think, but from thoſe cauſes we have aſſign'd. For that the Fomes of the Diſeaſe don't lurk in matter, will plainly appear by this one Inſtance, <hi>viz.</hi> a Woman that us'd to enjoy perfect Health being delicate, and of a thin habit of Body, if ſhe chance to be weaken'd and exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſome Error, or by a ſtrong Vomit or Purge, will certainly be afflicted with ſome one of thoſe Symptoms that accompany this Diſeaſe; which wou'd rather be remov'd than occaſion'd by ſuch vomiting or purging, if the Fomes of the Diſeaſes was contain'd in a Humour. The ſame may be ſaid of a great loſs of Blood, whether it's taken away by opening a Vein, or flows immoderately in Labour, or of Emptineſs, or too long Abſtinence from Fleſh; all which would rather prevent Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteric Diſeaſes than occaſion them, if the Fomes of them was involv'd in ſome matter: Whereas on the contrary, nothing does ſo conſtantly occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Diſeaſe as theſe Evacuations.</p>
            <p>But tho' 'tis apparent enough that the original Fomes of this Diſeaſe, is not lodg'd in the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, yet it muſt be confeſs'd that the confuſion
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:57356:30"/>
of the Spirits produces putrid Humours in the Body, by reaſon the Function as well of theſe parts which are diſtended by the violent impulſe of the Spirits, as of thoſe which are depriv'd of them, are wholly perverted. And moſt of theſe being as it were ſeparatory Organs deſigned for the reception of the impurities of the Blood, if their Functions are any way hurt, it can't be but a great many feculencies will be heap'd up, which had been eliminated, and ſo the Maſs of Blood purified, if the Organs had perform'd their Office; which they had certainly done, if a due oeconomy of the Spirits had invigorated them all. To this cauſe I attribute great Cachexies, loſs of Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, a Cloroſis, and the White Fever in young Women, (which I don't at all doubt, is a Species of hyſteric Diſeaſes) and the ſource of all the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries that overwhelm poor Women, that have Languiſh'd a long while under this Diſeaſe; all which proceed from putrifying Juices heapt up in the Blood, and flowing from thence upon the various Organs. Of this kind is a Dropſie of the Womb in Women, which have been long afflicted with this Diſeaſe, occaſion'd by deprav'd Juices caſt from the Blood upon the Organs, by which, their Faculties being perverted, they firſt become Barren, the oeconomy of the parts being wholly deſtroy'd, and then <hi>Serum</hi> and <hi>Sanies</hi> are generated, which don't only ſtuff the Eggs of the Teſtes, but alſo inſinuating themſelves into the Interſtices of the Coats, cauſe them to grow very big, which is perceiv'd by the diſſection of thoſe that dye of this Diſeaſe: And the hyſterical diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, is the prime cauſe of theſe and other
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:57356:30"/>
Humours, though they are not of the ſame kind with it.</p>
            <p>As in a quartan Ague, with which any one that's perfectly well may be ſeized, if he continues two or three days in Mooriſh and Fenny Places; firſt ſome Spirituous Venom of the Diſeaſe being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed upon the Blood, which continuing a long while, and at length the oeconomy of nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hurt, it infects all the Juices of the Body, and quite changes their Diſpoſitions; ſo that the Sick (eſpecially if he begins to grow old,) is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd obnoxious to Cachexies and other Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers which come upon long Agues; yet theſe Agues are not to be cured by thoſe Remedies that are proper to Purge off ſuch Humours, but by ſuch things as cure Agues by a Specifick quality.</p>
            <p>From all that has been treated of, it's very manifeſt to me, that that's the chief indication in this Diſeaſe, which directs the corroboration of the Blood that is the Fountain and Origine of the Spirits; which being done, the invigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated Spirits can preſerve that tenor that's a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the oeconomy of the whole Body, and the particular parts. And therefore when the <hi>Ataxy</hi> of the Spirits (which we have allow'd above may be) has vitiated the Humours by long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, 'twill be proper firſt to leſſen thoſe Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours ſo corrupted, by Bleeding and Purging, if the Patient has ſufficient ſtrength, before we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to corroborate the Blood, and which indeed we can ſcarce do, whilſt a feculent heap of Humours lies in the way. But foraſmuch as Pains, Vomiting and Looſeneſs are ſometimes ſo
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:57356:31"/>
very ſevere that they will not bear a truce ſo long until we have ſatisfied the firſt intention of fortifying the Blood, therefore ſometimes we muſt begin the cure, by quieting the effects, (the cauſe being let alone a little while,) with ſome Anodine Medicine, and then we muſt endeavour to rectifie the Spirits, whoſe infirm Conſtitution is the cauſe of this Diſeaſe, by which we may again endeavour to cure ſuch kind of Symptoms; and becauſe experience teaches, that there are many ſtinking things that will repel the inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Spirits, and contain them in their Places, (which are therefore call'd Hyſtericks,) we muſt make uſe of them when we would an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer ſuch intentions.</p>
            <p>According to what has been ſaid, I order the Patient to be Blooded in the Arm, and that after ſhe be Purg'd Three or Four Mornings follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Patient thinks her ſelf worſe of thoſe Days ſhe is Blooded and Purg'd, for theſe Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuations promote the Ataxy, which I take care to forewarn her of, that ſhe may not deſpond, the Diſeaſe of it ſelf being apt to incline her to do ſo; but however thoſe vicious Humours we ſuppoſe are heap'd up by the long continuance of the Diſeaſe, are in ſome ſort to be evacuated before we can conveniently anſwer the prime in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</p>
            <p>After theſe Evacuations, I preſcribe ſome Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lybeat Remedy to be taken Thirty Days to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort the Blood, and ſo by conſequence the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits that proceed from it; and nothing will more certainly anſwer your intention in this caſe, for it raiſes a volatile Ferment in the vapid and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guid
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:57356:31"/>
Blood, by which the weak Spirits are rous'd that before were preſs'd down by their own weight: And this is very manifeſt, for as often as Steel is given in a Chloroſis, the Pulſe are preſently greater and quicker, and the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts grow warm, and the pale and dead Countenance is chang'd, and becomes freſh and lively. But here we muſt take notice, that Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Purging muſt not always be us'd before Chalybeats; for when the Patient is weak, and almoſt worn out by the long continuance of the Diſeaſe, they may and ought to be omitted; and you muſt begin with Steel, which muſt be well minded.</p>
            <p>But in my opinion 'tis moſt conveniently gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in ſubſtance, and as I have never obſerv'd nor heard, that ſo taken, it ever injur'd any Body, ſo I have been fully ſatisfied by frequent experience, that the bare ſubſtance performs the Cure ſooner and better than any of the common Preparations of it, for buſie Chymiſts make this as well as other excellent Medicines, worſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than better by their perverſe and over of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficious Diligence. I have alſo heard, (and if it be true, it much ſtrengthens our Aſſertion,) that the crude Mine as 'tis digged out of the Earth, is more effectual in curing Diſeaſes, than Iron that has paſs'd the Fire, and been purified by Fuſion, ſo the Author affirms, but I have not yet try'd whether it is ſo or not. This I certainly known, that no excellent and powerful Remedy has been any where made, which has not received its chief Virtues from Nature; upon which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count grateful Antiquity call'd excellent Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:57356:32"/>
God's Handicraft, not Mans. And that ſome excellent thing does produce wonderful ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects by its native goodneſs and efficacy, may be prov'd by Opium, or the Peruvian Bark. Nor is a Phyſicians skill ſo much perceiv'd by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring Medicines, as by chooſing ſuch as are fit, which Nature has prepar'd with her own Fire, and freely beſtow'd upon us; ſo that all that we have to do, is to reduce Medicines into that form, whereby either their ſubſtance, or their vertue and efficacy may be better imparted to our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, for the performance whereof we are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently inſtructed. Next to the ſubſtance of the Steel, I chooſe the Syrup of it, prepar'd with the Filings of Steel or Iron infus'd in the cold, in Rheniſh Wine, 'till the Wine is ſufficiently im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated, and afterwards ſtrain'd, and boyl'd up to the conſiſtence of a Syrup, with a ſufficient quantity of Sugar.</p>
            <p>Nor do I uſe any Cathartick Medicine at ſet times during the whole Chalybeat courſe; for I am of the opinion, that the vertue of Steel is deſtroy'd by a Purge, both in Hyſterical and Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocondriacal Diſeaſes; and when my chief de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſign is to reduce the Spirits to order, and to renew and confirm their Syſtem, if I ſhould uſe the gentleſt Purge but once, I ſhould undo all that I had done in a Week before, and by pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down what I have built, and by building what I have pull'd down, I ſhould trifle with my ſelf and Patient too; and I believe Mineral Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which participate of an Iron Mine, are ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd leſs effectual by this means; though I know that ſome have been cur'd when Purges have not
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:57356:32"/>
been given only now and then; but daily with the Steel; which does not ſo much prove to me the Prudence of the Phyſician, as the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary virtue of the Steel; for if they had been omitted, the cure would have been performed in a leſs time.</p>
            <p>Nor indeed do I ſee what advantage, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not what diſadvantage Purges often repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed may produce in many other Diſeaſes beſides that juſt mention'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for though it can't be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied that they clear the Inteſtines of Impurities, and likewiſe that they ſomewhat diſcharge ill Humours that are lodg'd in the Maſs of Blood, yet on the contrary, 'tis no leſs certain, that when they are frequently repeated in weak Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, eſpecially in the tender age, they do much hurt, becauſe upon this account a great many Humours are drawn to the Inteſtines, and being put off upon theſe parts, occaſion praeternatural Ferments, whereby tumours ariſe in the Belly, increaſing daily ſo much the more, by how much the oftener the Sick is Purg'd; and at length it happens that thoſe parts by reaſon of weakneſs (being as it were overwhelm'd with a burden of Humours,) and by a defect of natural Heat ſoon become tabid and putrifie. And ſometimes alſo the oeconomy of the Bowels being quite deſtroy'd by reaſon of the Cauſes mentioned, preternatural Kernels, a-kin to the Kings-Evil, and the like, grow to the Meſentery, and make way for Death. For theſe Reaſons I judge 'tis ſafeſt in Children after general Evacuations, and thoſe but very few, to direct the Curative Indication, ſo as to comfort the Blood and Bowels, which may be
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:57356:33"/>
done with Spaniſh Wine alone, or with Corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating Herbs in it, if Morning and Evening ſome Spoonfuls of it, (according to the Age of the Sick) be given long enough. And becauſe things outwardly apply'd can eaſily penetrate the tender Bodies of Infants, and ſo can throughly affect the Blood with their Virtue whatever it is, 'twill be convenient in Swellings of their Bellies, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occaſion'd by the King's-Evil, or by the true Rickets, to uſe Liniments that are proper to corroborate the Blood and Bowels, and likewiſe to cure any Morbifick indiſpoſition of them.</p>
            <p>Take of the Leaves of Common-Wormwood, of the Leſſer Centaury, of white Whorehound, of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, of Ground-pine, of Meadow Saxifrage St. John's-wort, Golden Rod, Wild Thime, Mint, Sage, Rue, Carduus Benedict. Penny-royal, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thernwood, Chamomel, Tanſie, Lilly of the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, (of all freſh gather'd and cut) each Mi, of Lard <abbr>lb</abbr> iiij, of Sheep-Suet, and Claret-Wine, each <abbr>lb</abbr> ij; let them be ſteep'd in an Earthen Pot upon Hot Embers twelve Hours, and then let them boil till all the Moiſture is conſumed; afterwards ſtrain them, and ſo make an Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with which let the Belly be anointed Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Evening for Thirty or Forty Days fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, and alſo both the Arm-pits.</p>
            <p>But as to the Rickets, this muſt be noted, that in thoſe tumours that afflicted the Bellies of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants heretofore after long Agues, not much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the true Rickets, Purges repeated ſeem'd to be indicated; for before the uſe of the Peruvian Bark, Agues continued a long while, and put off a Sediment, which was the cauſe of tumours of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:57356:33"/>
this kind, which could be carried off only by Purges repeated. But in the true Rickets, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharticks are not to be us'd above once or twice at the moſt, before the Patient enters upon the uſe of Alteratives; and all the time the parts are anointed, let him take inwardly of the Wine above mention'd; or if it may be, let him uſe for his ordinary Drink Beer, with the foreſaid Herbs, or at leaſt many of them put up with it in the Veſſel. Laſtly, this I have hinted ought to be carefully minded, for I am fully ſatisfied, that many Infants and Children have been deſtroy'd by Purges often repeated, which perhaps were given to aſſwage the Belly: But this by the by.</p>
            <p>If any one object that the Filings of Steel may hurt thoſe that take them by ſticking in their Bowels, unleſs they are Purg'd now and then, I anſwer firſt, that I never found any ſuch thing in any one, and then 'tis much more probable that being involv'd in the Slime, and with the Excrementitious Humours of the parts, they ſhould all at length paſs away with them, than when they are exagitated by Purging Medicines, which occaſion unuſual compreſſions, twiſting and contraction of the Guts, whereby the Particles of Steel thruſt upon the Coats of the Bowels may penetrate deeper into them.</p>
            <p>When the Patient is in a Steel courſe, Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies commonly call'd Hyſtericks are to be us'd as 'twere by the by, (to comfort the Blood and Animal Spirits,) in that manner and form which is moſt agreeable to the Patient; but if ſhe can take them in a ſolid form, they will more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57356:34"/>
retain the Spirits in their office and place, than things that are Liquid, that is, either De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coctions or Infuſions, for the very ſubſtance af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects the Stomach longer with its ſavour, and works more forceably upon the Body.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, being about to anſwer all the Indications which I have touch'd upon above, I us'd to preſcribe theſe few and common things, which though they are not at all pompous, yet they moſt commonly do what I deſire.</p>
            <p>Let. ℥ viij of Blood be taken from the Right Arm.</p>
            <p>Take of Galbanum diſſolv'd in tincture of Caſtor, and ſtrain'd <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>iij, Tacamahac <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> ij, make an Emplaiſter to be apply'd to the Navel.</p>
            <p>The next Morning let her enter upon the uſe of the following Pills.</p>
            <p>Take of Pill Cocb. Maj. ℈ij, of Caſtor powder'd, gr. ij, of Peruvian Balſam gutt. iv, make Four Pills, let her take them at Five in the Morning, and Sleep after them; repeat them twice or thrice every Morning, or every other Morning, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their operation, and the ſtrength of the Patient.</p>
            <p>Take of Black-Cherry-Water, of Rue Water, and compound Briony Water, each ℥iij, of Caſtor tied up in a Rag, and hang'd in the Glaſs <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ſs, of fine Sugar, a ſufficient quantity, make a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lap, of which let her take Four or Five Spoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuls when ſhe is faint, dropping into the firſt Doſe if the Fit is violent gutt. xx of Spirit of Hartſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn.</p>
            <p>After the Purging Pills juſt deſcrib'd are taken, let her uſe the following.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:57356:34"/>
Take of the Filings of Steel, gr. viij, with a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient quantity of extract of Wormwood, make Two Pills, let her take them early in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and at Five in the Afternoon for Thirty Days, drinking upon them a draught of Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood Wine.</p>
            <p>Or for daily uſe,</p>
            <p>Take of the Filings of Steel, and of extract of Wormwood, each ℥iiij, mingle them, and keep them for uſe, let her take gr. xv, or ℈i, made into Three Pills.</p>
            <p>Or if ſhe likes a Bolus better,</p>
            <p>Take of Conſerve of Roman Wormwood, and of the Conſerve of the Yellow Rind of Oranges each ℥i, of Candied Angelica, and Nutmegs Candied, and Venice Treacle, each ℥ſs, of Candied Ginger <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ij, make an Electuary with a ſufficient quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Syrup of Oranges. Take of this Electua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>iſs, of the Filings of Steel well rubb'd, gr. viij, make a Bolus, with a ſufficient quantity of Syrup of Oranges, to be taken in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and at Five in the Evening, Drinking upon it a Draught of Wormwood Wine.</p>
            <p>Take of choice Mirrh, and Galbanum each <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>iſs, of Caſtor, gr<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> xv, with a ſufficient quantity of Balſam of Peru; make Twelve Pills of every Dram, let her take Three every Night, and Drink upon them Three or Four Spoonfuls of Compound Briony Water, through the whole courſe of this proceſs.</p>
            <p>But if the Pills laſt preſcrib'd move the Belly, which ſometimes happens in Bodies that are very eaſily Purg'd, by reaſon of the Gum that's in them, the following are to be ſubſtituted.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:57356:35"/>
Takt of Caſtor <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>i, of Volatile Salt of Amber <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ſs with a ſufficient quantity of extract of Rue, make xxiv ſmall Pills, let her take Three every Night.</p>
            <p>But here we muſt take notice, that Chaly beats in whatſoever form or Doſe they are taken, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion ſometimes in Women great Diſorders both of Body and Mind, and that not only on the firſt Days (which is uſual almoſt in every Body,) but alſo all the time they are taken. In this caſe the uſe of Steel muſt not be interrupted at thoſe times, but Laudanum muſt be given every Night for ſome time in ſome Hyſterick Water, that they may better bear it.</p>
            <p>But when the Symptoms are mild, and it ſeems that the buſineſs may be done without ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Steel, (namely when the Diſeaſe is ſmall,) I think it ſufficient to Bleed, and to Purge Three or Four times, and then to give the altering Hyſterick Pills above mention'd Morning and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening for Ten Days, which Method ſeldom fails when the Diſeaſe is not violent; yea, the Pills alone, Bleeding and Purging being omitted, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times do a great deal of good.</p>
            <p>Yet we muſt take great notice, that ſome Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men by a certain ideoſyncraſy do ſo abhor Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterical Medicines, (which give eaſe in moſt of the Symptoms of this Diſeaſe,) that they don't only not receive Benefit, but are much injured thereby; therefore they muſt not be given to ſuch, for <hi>Hipocrates</hi> ſays, 'tis in vain to do any thing contrary to Natures inclination.</p>
            <p>Which ideoſyncraſy indeed is ſo great and ſo frequent, that if we have not regard to it, the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57356:35"/>
Lives of the Sick may be hazarded, and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by Hyſterical Medicines, but by many other, whereof I will at preſent mention but one thing, <hi>viz.</hi> That ſome Women that have the Small-pox can't bear the uſe of Diacodium, for thereby Giddineſs, Vomiting, and ſuch Symptoms be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to Hyſterical Diſeaſes are occaſioned, and yet Liquid Laudanum agrees with them very well. Which I obſerv'd whilſt I was writing this, in a Young Woman a Perſon of Quality, to whom I had given the ſaid Syrup on the Sixth and Seventh Night; the Symptoms above mention'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded both Nights; nor did the Inflamation of the Puſtules duly proceed, but when afterwards ſhe us'd Laudanum, ſhe was quite freed from the ſaid Symptoms<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Swelling of the Face and Puſtules daily increaſing, the anxiety and reſtleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Body and Mind (which us'd to be as it were a Fit of the Small-pox,) was wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved as often as this Paregorick was given, the Patient being ſtrengthen'd and reviv'd by it: But this by the by.</p>
            <p>And ſo Hyſterical Diſeaſes are moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cur'd, and moſt Obſtructions of Women, but eſpecially a Cloroſis, or Virgins pale Colour, and alſo all Suppreſſions of the Courſes. But if the Blood is ſo very feeble, and the confuſion of the Spirits ſo great, that Steel order'd to be us'd ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Method preſcrib'd is not ſufficient to cure the Diſeaſe, the Patient muſt Drink ſome Mineral Waters, impregnated with the Iron Mine, ſuch as are <hi>Tunbridge,</hi> and ſome others lately found out, for the Chalybeat virtue of theſe is better mingled with the Blood, by reaſon of the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:57356:36"/>
great quantity that's taken of them, and alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are more agreeable to Nature, and they cure Diſeaſes more effectually than Iron, how much ſoever exalted by art, as imprudent Chymiſts talk.</p>
            <p>But this is more eſpecially to be obſerv'd in Drinking of them, that if any Sickneſs happens that is to be referr'd to Hyſterical Symptoms, in this caſe the Patient muſt forbear drinking them a day or two, 'till that Symptom that hinder'd their paſſage is quite gone. For though theſe Waters are leſs apt to ſtir the Humours, and ſo to cauſe a Confuſion of the Spirits, than the gentleſt Catharticks of the Shops, yet they do ſomewhat exagitate them as they are diuretick, though they often alſo purge by Stool too. But if the Waters themſelves hinder their own Paſſage by diſturbing the Humours and Spirits, let thoſe conſider how impertinently they act, who order Purging Medicines to be given once or twice a Week, whilſt the Patient is Drinking theſe Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; or which is yet more fooliſh, to be mix'd with the Waters, by which means theſe and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mineral Waters paſs more difficulty.</p>
            <p>And here I muſt acquaint you, that though ſome think the Iron is in theſe Waters <hi>in princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piis ſolutis,</hi> (which is plainly the ſame as if we ſhould ſuppoſe Liquid Iron,) yet I don't at all doubt but that they are Simple Waters, impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated with the Mine through which they paſs, which will be manifeſt to any one, if he pour ſome Gallons of Water upon a ſufficient quantity of Ruſty Nails, for then he will perceive that this Water, when the Powder of Gauls, or the Leaves
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:57356:36"/>
of Tea, or the like are put into it, will plainly appear of the ſame colour with the Waters of a Mineral Fountain, when ſuch things are put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. Nor truly have theſe artificial or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>artificial Waters (which you pleaſe to call them,) when they are taken, different effects, if they are us'd in Summer-time, and in a good Air.</p>
            <p>But however it is, if the Diſeaſe by reaſon of its obſtinacy does not yield to Steel Waters, the Patient muſt go to ſome hot Sulphureous Waters, ſuch as is our Bath, and when he has us'd them inwardly Three Mornings following, the next Day let him go into the Bath, and the Day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing let him Drink them again, and ſo let him do by turns for Two whole Months. For in theſe and in others of what kind ſoever they are, this muſt be carefully noted, that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient muſt perſiſt in the uſe of them, not only till he receives ſome benefit, but till he is quite well, that the Symptoms may not return again in a ſhort time.</p>
            <p>Venice Treacle alone, if it is uſed often, and a long while, is a great Remedy in this Diſeaſe, and not only in this, but in very many other Diſeaſes that proceed from want of Heat and Concoction or Digeſtion; 'tis perhaps the moſt powerful that has been hitherto known, how contemptible ſoever it may ſeem to moſt People, becauſe 'tis common, and has been known a long while.</p>
            <p>Spaniſh Wine Medicated with Gentian, Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lica, Wormwood, Centaury, the Yellow Rind of Oranges, and other Corroboratives infus'd in it,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:57356:37"/>
does a great deal of good, ſome Spoonfuls of it being taken Thrice a Day, if the Woman be not of a thin and Cholerick habit of Body. And truly a large Draught of Spaniſh Wine by it ſelf taken at Bed-time for ſome Nights, by my advice has been very beneficial to ſome Hyſterical Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, for by it the habit of the whole Body was render'd ſtronger, and they who before were Cachectical, became freſh colour'd and brisk.</p>
            <p>Moreover ſometimes we find that the Peruvian Bark wonderfully comforts and invigorates the Blood and Spirits, whereof a Scruple taken Morning and Evening for ſome Weeks, has as I have obſerv'd reſtored (both to Hypocondriacal Men, and Hyſterical Women that have been ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sick a long while, and when the oeconomy of their Bodies has been much weaken'd,) a firm and Healthy Conſtitution. But it ſucceeds beſt in that kind of Hyſterick Diſeaſes, in which Women are affected with Convulſions, wherein they ſtruggle violently and beyond the ſtrength of Women, and at the ſame time beat their Breaſts. Yet it muſt be confeſs'd that this Medicine does not ſo certainly, and ſo often cure this Diſeaſe as A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues. But though (to mention this by the by,) the Peruvian Bark does wonders in the cure of Agues, and though we uſe it freely our ſelves, and give it to our Wives and Children, as often as there's occaſion, yet there are ſome now as much diſpleas'd with it, becauſe it cures ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly and ſuddenly as they were heretofore, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was but lately known among us; to which fate the beſt Men, and moſt excellent Remedies have been almoſt always expos'd. But by this
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:57356:37"/>
we may try as by a Touch-ſtone our Diſpoſitions, and from thence judge whether we are good or ill Men, namely, according to the degree of our joy or grief, as often as the welfare of Mankind is promoted by ſome common benefit, or the Bleſſing of God.</p>
            <p>But if any of the Remedies above mention'd don't well agree, which often happens in Chole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick and thin Conſtitutions, then a Milk Diet may be us'd; for ſome Women (which one would wonder at at firſt) that have conflicted a long while with Hyſterick Diſeaſes, and even ſuch as have fruſtrated all the endeavours of Phyſicians, yet have recover'd by Dieting themſelves for ſome time only with Milk, and eſpecially thoſe that labour with that Diſeaſe I call an Hyſterick Colick, which can't be appeas'd by any thing but Narcoticks, to which repeated by intervals, theſe Women are much accuſtom'd, the Pain returning as ſoon as the Vertue of the Anodine fades; but this is chiefly to be admir'd in this Method of cure, that Milk which yields only a cold and crude nouriſhment, ſhould notwithſtanding by uſe ſtrengthen and invigorate the Spirits; and yet this will not ſeem diſagreeable to reaſon, if you conſider that Milk affording only a ſimple nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, does not buſie nature much in concoct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, otherwiſe than Meats and Liquors more compounded uſe to do, and that an equal tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Blood and Spirits neceſſarily follows that perfect Concoction. For this muſt be alſo conſider'd, that a bare debility of the Spirits conſider'd by it ſelf, is not the cauſe of thoſe Confuſions they are under, but the weakneſs of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:57356:38"/>
them compair'd with the ſtate of the Blood. For it may be an Infant has Spirits ſtrong and firm enough with reſpect to it's Blood, but yet not proportionable to the Blood of a grown Perſon. Now when by the continual uſe of a Milk Diet, (tho' 'tis crude and weak) the Blood is render'd more ſoft and tender, if the Spirits that are made by it, are only equal to it, all's well. Yet all can't undergo thoſe Inconveniencies which moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly accompany it the firſt days, namely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it curdles in the Stomach, and is inſufficient to maintain the uſual ſtrength of the Body; but if they cou'd, they might receive benefit by it.</p>
            <p>But nothing of all I have hitherto known, does ſo much comfort and ſtrengthen the Blood and Spirits, as riding much a Horſe Back every day for a long while; for ſeeing by this kind of Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe the lower Belly is moſt forceably mov'd, in which the Veſſels for excretion (as many as are appointed by Nature to drain the Impurities of the Blood) are plac'd: What diſorder of the Functions or other natural Impotence of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, can be imagin'd ſo great as not to be helpt by the frequent jolting of the Horſe, and that too in the open Air? Whoſe innate heat is ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh'd that it can't be ſtir'd up by this motion and ferment afreſh? Or what preter-natural Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance or deprav'd Juice can there be in any Creek of theſe parts, which can't by this Exerciſe of the Body, be either reduced to ſuch a condition as is agreeable to Nature, or ſcatter'd every way and ejected? Moreover, the Blood being perpetually exagitated by this motion, and throughly mix'd, is as it were renew'd, and grows vigorous again.
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:57356:38"/>
And indeed, this method, tho 'tis inconvenient for Women that are accuſtom'd to a ſlothful and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate way of living, for they may be injured by motion, eſpecially at the beginning; yet is it very proper for Men, and ſooneſt recovers their Health. One of our Reverend Biſhops, famous for Prudence and Learning, having ſtudyed too hard a long while, fell at length into an hypochondriacal Diſeaſe, which afflicting him a long time, vitiated all the ferments of the Body, and wholly ſubvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Concoctions. He had paſs'd through long courſes of Steel more than once, and had try'd almoſt all mineral Waters, with purging often repeated, and Antiſcorbuticks of all kinds, and very many teſtaceous Powders, which are rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon'd proper to ſweeten the Blood: And ſo being in a manner worn out, partly by the Diſeaſe, and partly by Phyſick us'd continually for ſo many years, he was at length ſeiz'd with a colliquative Looſneſs, which is wont to be the forerunner of Death, in Conſumptions and other <hi>Cronical Diſeaſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> when the Digeſtions are wholly deſtroy'd. At length he conſulted me. I preſently conſider'd that there was no more room for Medicine, he having taken ſo many already, without any relief; for which reaſon I perſwaded him to ride a Horſe-Back, and that firſt he ſhou'd take ſuch a ſmall Journy as was agreeable to his weak condition: Had he not been a very judicious man, and one that weighed things well, he wou'd not have been perſwaded ſo much as to try ſuch a kind of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe. I intreated him to perſiſt in it daily, till in his own opinion he was well, going daily fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and further, till at length he went ſo many
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:57356:39"/>
Miles, as prudent and moderate Travellers, that go a large Journy upon buſineſs, uſe to do, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any regard to Meat or Drink, or the Weather; but that he ſhou'd take every thing like a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller as it happens. To be ſhort, he continued this method, increaſing his Journies by degrees, till at length he rode Twenty or Thirty Miles daily; and when he found himſelf much better in a few days, being incourag'd by ſuch wonderful Succeſs, he continued this courſe a pretty many Months, in which time, as he told me, he rode many Thouſand Miles, till at length, he did not only recover, but alſo gain'd a ſtrong and brisk habit of Body.</p>
            <p>Nor is this kind of Exerciſe more beneficial to hypochondriacal People, than 'tis to thoſe that are in a Conſumption; whereof ſome of my Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have been cur'd by riding long Journies by my advice; for I knew I cou'd not cure them bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by Medicines of what value ſoever, or by any other method.</p>
            <p>Nor is this Remedy proper only in ſmall Indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, accompanied with a frequent Cough and Leanneſs, but in Conſumptions that are almoſt deplorable; when the Diarrhaea above mention'd, accompanies the Night Sweats, which is wont to be the forerunner of Death, in thoſe that dye of a Conſumption. In a word, how deadly ſoever a Conſumption is, and is ſaid to be, two Thirds dying of it, which are ſpoil'd by <hi>Chronical Diſeaſes:</hi> Yet I ſincerely affirm, That Mercury in the French Pox, and the Peruvian Bark in Agues, are not more effectual than the Exerciſe above menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd, in curing a Conſumption, if the Sick takes
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:57356:39"/>
care that his Sheets are well air'd, and that his Journies are long enough. But this muſt be noted, that thoſe that have paſs'd the Flower of their Age, muſt uſe this Exerciſe much longer than thoſe that have not yet arriv'd to it. And this I have learn'd by much Experience, which ſcarce ever fails me. And tho' riding on Horſe-Back is chiefly beneficial to conſumptive People, yet riding Journies in a Coach, does ſometimes a great deal of good.</p>
            <p>But to return to the buſineſs in hand, this is the general way of cure in this Diſeaſe, which is apply'd to the original cauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the weak cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis of the Blood, and ſo is to be us'd only when the Fit is off; therefore as often as the Fit invades, join'd with any one of the foreſaid Symptoms, if the Diſeaſe be ſuch, or ſo great a one, that 'twill not bear a truce, 'till it may be cured by Medicines that corroborate the Blood and Spirits, we muſt preſently make uſe of hyſterick Remedies, which by their ſtrong and offenſive Smell, recall the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant and deſerting Spirits to their proper Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whether they are taken inwardly, or ſmelt to, or outwardly apply'd; ſuch are <hi>Aſſafaetida, Galbanum, Caſtor, Spirit of Sal Armonicack:</hi> And laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whatever has a very ungrateful and offenſive Smell.</p>
            <p>And in truth, whatever ſtinks is proper for this intention, whether 'tis naturally ill ſented, or made ſo by Art; and unleſs I am deceiv'd, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Harts-horn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of human Blood, of Urine, and of Bones, and the like; take their chief Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues from the force of the Fire, in their prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion contracting an ill ſented <hi>empyreuma,</hi> which is

intimately join'd with their Eſſence, which is likewiſe in the Fumes ariſing from Feathers, and ſuch kind of parts of Animals, when they are burnt. For this is common to the Subſtances of all Animals, <hi>viz.</hi> to emit a ſtinking Fume while they are burning; and if 'tis forc'd by Fire, and receiv'd in Glaſſes, when 'tis condens'd, it becomes thoſe Liquors call'd Volatile Spirits, which aſſume Faculties that were not primitively in their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; and are indeed, only Creatures of Fire, and their Vertues are really all the ſame, from whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Subſtance (ſo it is animal) they are extracted.</p>
            <p>In the next place we muſt take notice, That if ſome intolerable pain accompanies the Paroxyſm, in whatever part it is, or violent Vomiting, or a Diarrhaea; then beſides the hyſtericks above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, Laudanum muſt be us'd, which only is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to reſtrain theſe Symptoms.</p>
            <p>But in quieting theſe pains which vomiting oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, we muſt take great care that they are not mitigated either by Laudanum or any other Pare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorick, before due Evacuations have been made, unleſs they almoſt exceed all human Patience. Firſt, becauſe ſometimes there is ſo great a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Blood and Humours heapt up, (eſpecially in ſanguine Women and Men of a proper habit) that 'tis able to withſtand the Operation of the moſt effectual Narcotic, tho' it be often repeated: And therefore in ſuch, Blood muſt neceſſarily be evacuated from the Veins of the Arm, and a Purge muſt be given before we come to uſe Laudanum. For when theſe things are duly perform'd, that which before given in a large Doſe wou'd do no good, will now perform the buſineſs in a moderate
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:57356:40"/>
Doſe. And then becauſe I have found by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Experience, that when the Sick has been accuſtom'd by little and little to Laudanum, and has not been duly evacuated before, ſhe was forc'd by reaſon of the return of the pain, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after the Vertue of the Medicine vaniſh'd, to take a Paregorick again; and ſo daily for ſome years, the Doſe being ſometimes by degrees in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd, ſo that at laſt they can by no means ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from Laudanum, tho' thereby all the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions are vitiated, and the natural Functions weakned. Tho' I don't think that the uſe of Laudanum does immediately hurt the Brain or Nerves, or the animal Faculties. Therefore I judge, and I ſpeak what I have found, that Evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation ought to go before Anodynes, <hi>viz.</hi> in Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rago's, and in Women that abound with Blood, a Vein muſt be open'd, and the Body purg'd; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if they have been lately ſeized with the Fit. But if the weak Women and thoſe of a quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Conſtitution, labour with ſuch a Fit and Pain, and have been not long ago afflicted with it, 'twill be ſufficient to cleanſe their Stomachs with a Gallon of Poſſet-drink, more or leſs, taken in and ejected by Vomit; and then to give a large Doſe of <hi>Venice Treacle,</hi> or of the <hi>Orvietan Electuary,</hi> and a few Spoonfuls of ſome Spirituous Liquor, that is pleaſing to the Taſte; with a few Drops of Liquid Laudanum<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to be taken preſently after it.</p>
            <p>But if the Sick has vomited a great while before the Phyſician was call'd, and there is danger, leſt by a further Provocation by Emeticks, the Spirits ſhou'd be put in a rage, and the Sick too much
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:57356:41"/>
weaken'd; In this caſe you muſt give Laudanum without delay, and ſuch a Doſe as is not only e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to the violence and duration of the Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, but ſuch a one as is ſufficient to vanquiſh it.</p>
            <p>But here two things are to be chiefly noted. Firſt, that when you have once begun to uſe Laudanum after due and neceſſary Evacuations, it muſt be taken in that Doſe, and often repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, till the Symptom is quite conquer'd; only ſuch a ſpace muſt be betwixt each Doſe, that we may know what the former has done, before we give another. And then when we treat the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe with Laudanum, we muſt do nothing elſe, and nothing muſt be evacuated; for the gentleſt Glyſter of Milk and Sugar, is ſufficient to ſpoyl whatever has been repair'd by the Paregoric, and to occaſion the return of the vomiting and pain.</p>
            <p>But tho' the pains above mention'd, as we have ſaid, are apt to overcome the Vertue of the Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyne, yet violent Vomiting indicates the largeſt Doſe of it, and that it ſhou'd be very often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated; for by the inverted periſtaltick motion of the Stomach, (by which that which is contain'd in it, ought to be carried downwards) the Pare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorick is ejected through the oeſophagus, before it can do any good, unleſs after every time the Sick vomits, the Narcotick be given afreſh, and chiefly in a ſolid form; or if it be given in a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, the Vehicle muſt be ſo ſmall, as that it may but juſt wet the Stomach, ſo that by reaſon of the ſmall quantity of the matter, it can't be caſt up; for inſtance, ſome drops in one Spoonful of ſtrong
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:57356:41"/>
Cinamon Water, or the like; and the Sick muſt be admoniſh'd to keep her ſelf quiet, preſently after taking the Laudanum; and that ſhe keep her Head as much as is poſſible immoveable, for the ſmalleſt motion of the Head, provokes vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more than any thing elſe, and then the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine juſt taken, is ejected. Yet when the vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ceaſes, and is as 'twere tam'd, 'tis expedient to give an Anodyne Morning and Evening for a few days, to prevent a Relaps; which alſo ought to be obſerv'd after a Diarrhaea, or an hyſterick pain taken off by a Narcotick. And ſo at length by this method, we may readily cure the ſymptoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick pain and vomiting, whereby, becauſe they are very often, like other Diſeaſes, Phyſicians are eaſier impos'd upon, than by any other Symptoms whatever, that require their help; concerning which, I will add a few things, for inſtance: In that kind of hyſterick Diſeaſe now deſcrib'd, which reſembles a nephritick pain, is not the great Parity and Similitude of both Diſeaſes, apparent to any one, both becauſe the pain in both is in the ſame part, and alſo for that the Woman vomits in both Diſeaſes? And yet they proceed from cauſes differing from one another; and the methods for the cure of them ſo unlike, that that which does good in this, is injurious in the other, and ſo on the contrary. For whether a Stone or Gravel, fretting upon the Subſtance of the Reins, occaſions Pain, and by conſent of Parts, vomiting, nothing is ſo beneficial, as very large and frequent revulſion of the antecedent cauſe by Phlebotomy, and Dilatation and Laxation of the Paſſages, by which the Stone is to be excluded,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:57356:42"/>
by emollient Clyſters very often repeated, and inward Remedies of the ſame kind, to which are to be added Linthontriptick and Diuretic Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines. Now if the ſaid Symptoms do no way a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe from the Stone, but from the animal Spirits ruſhing impetuouſly in a great quantity upon the Reins, (in which caſe, Paregoricks are only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated; nor is the gentleſt Clyſter injected after the firſt Evacuations, without danger) in what great danger the unhappy Woman is put into, whoſe Life is ſo triffl'd with, I need not ſay. The ſame may be affirm'd of that hyſteric Diſeaſe, which reſembles the Bilious Colick, or the Iliack Paſſion, when 'tis taken for granted, that that Diſeaſe, (tho' of a quite different, yea contrary nature) is the Bilious Colick, and proceeds from a ſharp Humour caſt upon the Bowels, through the Mouths of the meſenterick Arteries; (into which Error the intollerable Pain and the green colour of the Matter expell'd by Vomit and Stool, eaſily ſeduces the unwary and unthinking Phyſician) what method is ſo proper, as that whereby we endeavour to attemperate the Acrimony of the Humours, by the help of cooling and incraſſating Medicines? And what is fitter than Catharticks frequently given, beſides Clyſters daily injected to exterminate the Humous from the Guts, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <hi>Mercurius dulcis</hi> mixt with diagrydiate Medicines, to eradicate perfectly the morbific Matter? But 'tis plain to every one, how ill the Patient wou'd be treated, and in what great Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger he wou'd be, whilſt we ſhou'd inſiſt upon this method, if the Diſeaſe which is ſupps'd to be a bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious Colick, ſhou'd really prove an hyſterick or
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:57356:42"/>
hypocondriacal Symptom, when Experience open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proclaims, that after the firſt general Evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (which are appointed to remove the Rubbiſh of the putrifying Humours, which the Ataxy has occaſion'd, whereby the Vertue of the Anodyne may be obſtructed) nothing remains to be done, beſides the quieting the tumultuous Spirits, till the Symptom goes off, and afterwards 'twill be ſeaſonable to give Chalybeats, or any other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, if there be any that by kindling and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorating the Blood, may eradicate the Diſeaſe. 'Tis not my buſineſs to reckon up thoſe great Calamities which I have known befal Women, when this hyſterick Colick has been ſuppos'd to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from Choler, notwithſtanding I affirm, that Evacuations often repeated, which are indeed indicated in the Bilious Colick, have been ſo far from leſſening the Pain and Vomiting, that they have ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritated them more, by promoting the Diſturbance of the Spirits, which is the true cauſe of theſe Symptoms. And at length the Diſeaſe being prolong'd for ſome Months, ends in Convulſions, there being a ſuddain Tranſlation to the Brain, whereby the Sick is ſoon deſtroy'd; and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when after other Evacuations repeated a long time, by reaſon of the green colour of thoſe things that are vomited up, a Vomit is given. In a word, if I have learnt any thing by Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, I judge we muſt chiefly take care, that thoſe Symptoms familiar to hyſterick Women, be not ſuppos'd by a Miſtake in the Diagnoſtick, to proceed from other Diſeaſes, which they oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en reſemble.</p>
            <p>And here I muſt acquaint you, that beſides the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:57356:43"/>
Errors before mention'd, whereby Women obnox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious to hyſterick Diſeaſes, are put in danger of their Lives; very many moreover, ſuffer by theſe Diſeaſes, by an Error no leſs fatal, at a time wherein, tho' this Diſeaſe is not of its own nature deadly, yet by reaſon of the Diſaſters that come upon it <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>and follow'd it, 'tis Deſtructive to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: For inſtance, a Woman of a tender and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm habit of Body, brings forth a Child, and all ſucceeds well, and according to Nature. The Midwife, whether Rude and Unskilful, or Vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious, to ſhew how well ſhe has perform'd her buſineſs, adviſes that her Woman ſhou'd riſe a few days after ſhe has been brought to Bed, and that ſhe ſhou'd keep up a while; the Woman does ſo, and is preſently ſeiz'd upon the firſt motion of her Body, with an hyſterick Indiſpoſition, and according as the Diſeaſe increaſes, the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia are firſt leſſen'd, then they quite ſtop, whoſe Suppreſſion, a long Series of untimely Symptoms follow; which ſoon deſtroys the Sick, unleſs great Diligence and Skilfulneſs interceed. And ſometimes they are ſeiz'd with a Phrenſie on this account, which growing daily worſe and worſe, occaſions Convulſions firſt, and then Death. But if they eſcape Death, they are maddiſh, and ſometimes continue ſo as long as they live. Sometimes after the Suppreſſion of the Lochia, they fall into a Fever, which either turns to that which is then epidemical, or depends only on that beginning. Moreover, the ſame hyſterick Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms which were firſt occaſion'd by the Suppreſſion of the Lochia, rage more now, as if afterwards they proceeded from it. I thought long ago, that
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:57356:43"/>
of thoſe Women that dye in Child-bed, ſcarce one in ten, to ſpeak within bounds, dies, becauſe ſhe has not ſtrength neceſſary for Delivery, or from the pains that accompany difficult Labour, but chiefly by reaſon they riſe too ſoon, Hyſterical Fits being occaſioned by that motion, whereby when the Lochia are ſtopt, a numerous train of dreadful Symptoms follows<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Wherefore they that are adviſed by me, keep in Bed at leaſt till the Tenth Day, if they are of a<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> weakly Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, eſpecially if they have been long ſince troubled with Vapours. For beſides that, the Reſt which they have in Bed, frees them from thoſe Dangers we have ſo often mentioned; the warmth of the Bed not interrupted, likewiſe refreſhes the Spirits weakned and exhauſted by the pains in Labour, and by the Evacuations uſual in this caſe, and recruits Nature, and digeſts and removes all thoſe Crudities which are heapt up during the time of Child-bearing.</p>
            <p>But if by reaſon of this error committed, any one of the ſaid Symptoms ſupervenes, the cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Indications are to be directed ſo, that the Spirits diſquieted by this motion ſhould be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peas'd, and that the Lochia ſhould flow again, for as much as the ſuppreſſion of them is the next and immediate cauſe of theſe Symptoms. But we muſt not obſtinately inſiſt upon this method, but having given a while thoſe Remedies that are wont to be uſed with ſucceſs in this caſe, if they don't anſwer according to our deſires, we muſt leave them off; for as ſtrong things muſt not be us'd, ſo neither ought we to perſevere in the uſe of gentler, by reaſon Women in Child-bed
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:57356:44"/>
ſo affected, are much weaken'd, and their ſtrength almoſt worn out. For inſtance, when it firſt appears that the Lochia are ſtopt, 'tis conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to put the Woman preſently to Bed, and then to apply an Hyſterick Plaiſter to the Navel, and to order this Electuary following to be taken forthwith.</p>
            <p>Take of the Conſerve of Roman Wormwood, and of Rue each ℥i, of the Trochiſc. of Mirrh <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ij, of Caſtor, Engliſh Saffron, of Volatile Salt of Sal Armoniac, and of Aſſa Faetida, each <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ſs, make an Electuary with a ſufficient quantity of the Syrup of the five opening Roots; let her take the quantity of a large Nutmeg every third Hour, drinking upon it Four or Five Spoonfuls of the following Julap.</p>
            <p>Take of Rue Water, compound Briony Water, each ℥iij, of Sugar Candy, ſ. q. mingle them, make a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lap.</p>
            <p>And if theſe things are given as ſoon as the ſuppreſſion begins, the Diſeaſe is moſt commonly conquer'd, but if having continued the uſe of the ſaid Remedies, till the whole quantity is taken, in this caſe we muſt try Laudanum once. Here Laudanum though of its own nature 'tis aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, yet by quieting the diſturbance of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits whereby the uſual Evacuation of the Lochia is interrupted, does ſometimes much good, and when Emmenagogs do no good, it may recall the Flux of the Lochia; but Narcoticks are moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently given with Hyſtericks and Emmenagogs. For inſtance, <hi>Fourteen Drops of Liquid Laudanum in Compound Briony Water, or one Grain and a half of Solid Laudanum made into Two Pills, with half ae</hi>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:57356:44"/>
               <hi>Scruple of Aſſa Faetida<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> But we muſt be ſure to take notice, that if we don't hit the Mark at once, if the Lochia don't follow, we muſt by no means repeat the Opium, as is uſual in other caſes, and ought to be: For if here the Paregorick is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, 'twill ſo powerfully ſtop the Lochia, that afterwards they can by no means be provok'd; for truly if this dont ſucceed (ſome time being paſs'd that we may know what it has perform'd,) we muſt return to the uſe of Emmenagogs, mixt with Hyſtericks, and then inject a Clyſter of Milk and Sugar; and what was ſaid above of Opium<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> holds good likewiſe here of Clyſters, for unleſs the firſt injected bring the Lochia, nothing is to be expected from more, one being ſufficient, by turning the Humour gently, to cauſe the Lochia to flow, but more may divert them another way. Theſe things being perform'd (which are to be touch'd upon lightly,) 'tis moſt ſafe and the duty of a prudent Phyſician, to wait and ſee what time will do, for every Day the buſineſs of the Cure is more and more removed from Danger, and if the Sick live beyond the Twentieth Day, ſhe's in a manner out of danger. For when the Woman has been recruited a little, and gain'd ſome Strength, in a long Diſeaſe whatever 'tis, ſhe will be able to bear that Remedy which is fitteſt for the cure of that Diſeaſe, which was occaſion'd by a ſuppreſſion of the Lochia; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Medicines cram'd in obſtinately, the firſt do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no good, may increaſe the Diſeaſe, and alſo the diſturbance of the Spirits from whence the Diſeaſe ariſes, which muſt be carefully no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:57356:45"/>
Lately a Vertuous Matron of good Parentage ſent for me, ſhe upon the foremention'd occaſion, preſently after ſhe was brought to Bed, was ſeiz'd with Hyſterick Fits, and the Lochia ſtop'd. I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd by the Medicines aforeſaid to provoke them, but in vain, the violence of the Hyſterick Diſeaſe being too powerful for the Medicines; and at length when I perceiv'd ſhe would be well if I did nothing, I committed all to time, by much the beſt and moſt ſucceſsful Phyſician; and according to my Opinion things went well with her to the Fourteenth Day: Viſiting her daily, I found ſhe was no day worſe than ſhe was the Day before. After this the Women that had attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon her, whom I had hitherto kept from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miſchief by their over-officiouſneſs, enforc'd the Husband to have a Vein opened inſtantly in his Wives Foot, which being done, the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterick Fits ſo far prevailed, that within a few Hours ſhe was ſeiz'd with Convulſions, and ſoon after by Death, that ends all our Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
            <p>And if it be lawful to ſpeak what I think, I have been a long time of the Opinion, that I have well perform'd the Duty of an Honeſt Man and good Phyſician, (not only in the ſaid Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Women in Child-bed, but alſo in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Acute Diſeaſes, when I can't certainly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe that a Cure will follow this or that method I pleaſe to uſe), as often as I do nothing, when vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiting the Patient, I find he is not worſe this day, than he was the Day before, and when I can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture he will not be worſe to Morrow than he is to day; whereas if I proceed in curing the Sick
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:57356:45"/>
with a method, the efficacy whereof I don't yet know, he will be in danger both upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Experiment I am about to make upon him, and alſo by the Diſeaſe, nor will he as eaſily evade two Dangers as one. For though at preſent there is no manifeſt ſign of his beginning to be well, yet 'tis moſt certain that according to the nature of Acute Diſeaſes, no one can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways labour with them. And beſides every Day will more and more ſecure the Patient, or yield an occaſion to the Phyſician, whereby he may more opportunely and certainly vanquiſh the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe, than he could before. Which as it may be truly affirm'd of moſt Diſeaſe, ſo eſpecially of the Diſeaſes of Child-bed Women, wherein the leaſt error may prove fatal, and in which we are ſo little able to govern that natural Evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the ſuppreſſion whereof occaſions the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes we have been treating of.</p>
            <p>But foraſmuch as Hyſterical Diſeaſes dont al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways owe their Original to the prime cauſe, namely the native debility of the Spirits, but ſometimes to an adventitious weakneſs; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I deſign before I make an end, to diſcourſe of this ſort of cauſe, which moſt commonly is the occaſion of Vapours as they are call'd; and 'tis an immoderate Flux of the Courſes either in Child-Bed, or at other times as to the firſt kind, that comes and is very troubleſom the firſt Days after hard Labour, accompanied with a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous train of Hyſterical Symptoms; and as it only comes, and is troubleſom on theſe firſt Days, ſo it ſoon goes away, for a Diet that is ſomewhat thickening, eaſily drives it away,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:57356:46"/>
for which alſo the following Drink may be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
            <p>Take of Plantain Water and Red Wine, each thi, boil them together, till a third part is Conſumed; then ſweeten it with a ſ. q. of White Sugar, whereof when 'tis cold, give half a Pint twice or thrice a day; in the mean while ſome very gentle Hyſterick Julap may be taken now and then, and the following Nodulus may be held to the Noſe. Take of Galbanum, and Aſſa faetida, each <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ij, Caſtor <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>iſs, of Volatile Salt of Amber <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ſs, mingle them and make a Nodulus. Or, take <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ij of Spirit of Sal Armoniac, to which let her ſmell often.</p>
            <p>But as to the Flux, when Women are not in Child-bed, though that is wont to happen at any time, yet moſt commonly it comes a little before the time the Courſes are about to leave them, namely about the Age of Forty Five if they flow early, but about Fifty, if they come ſomewhat later; from theſe as is ſaid a little before they quite go away, (like a Candle burnt to the Socket, which gives the greateſt Light juſt as 'tis about to go out,) they flow impetuouſly, and caſt the poor Women into almoſt continual Hyſterick Fits, by reaſon of the great quantity of Blood which is continually evacuated. Now though in this caſe, Hyſtericks both inward and outward muſt be us'd by the by (avoiding thoſe that are ſtrong, leſt they ſhould promote the Flux) yet the chief intention muſt be to ſtop the Courſes, which may be ſoon done after this manner.</p>
            <p>Let ℥ viij of Blood be drawn from the Arm, the next Morning give the common Purgative Potion, which muſt be repeated every Third Day
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:57356:46"/>
for Twice, and every Night at Bed time through the whole Courſe, let her take a Paregorick made with one Ounce of Diacodium.</p>
            <p>Take of Conſerve of Dry'd Roſes ℥ij, of Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſc, of Terra Lemnia <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>iſs, of Pomegranate Peel, and Red Coral, each ℈ij, of Lapis Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matitis and Dragons Blood, and Bole Armenic, each ℈i, make an Electuary with a ſufficient quantity of Simple Syrup of Coral, whereof let her take the quantity of a large Nutmeg in the Morning, and at Five in the Afternoon, Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon it Six Spoonfuls of the following Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lap.</p>
            <p>Take of the Water of Oak Buds and Plantain, each ℥iij, of Cinamon Water hor deated, and of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup of dry'd Roſes, each ℥i, of Spirit of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol a ſufficient quantity to make a pleaſant A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid.</p>
            <p>Take of the Leaves of Plantain, and Nettles, each a ſufficient quantity, beat them together in a Marble Mortar, and preſs out the Juice; then clarifie it; let her take Six Spoonfuls cold three or Four times a day. After the firſt Purge, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the following Plaiſter to the region of the Loins.</p>
            <p>Take of Diapalma, and of the Plaiſter <hi>ad her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niam,</hi> each equal parts, mingle them, and ſpread upon Leather.</p>
            <p>A cooling and thickening Diet muſt be order'd, only 'twill be proper to indulge the Sick a ſmall draught of Claret Wine, once or twice a day, whch though 'tis ſomewhat inconvenient, becauſe its apt to raiſe the Ebullition, yet it may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd to repair the Strength. And as indeed
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:57356:47"/>
this Method is very beneficial to Women thus af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, ſo is it alſo as uſeful for thoſe that are in danger of Abortion, only the Purges and Juices muſt be omitted.</p>
            <p>There is another cauſe, though 'tis not ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent of Hyſterical Diſeaſes, <hi>viz.</hi> a falling of the Womb by reaſon of a hard labour, its accompanied with a large train of this kind of Diſeaſes, yet is it ſoon and eaſily cur'd this way.</p>
            <p>Take of Oak Bark ℥ii, boyl it in <abbr>lb</abbr>iiij of Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Water to <abbr>lb</abbr>ij, add at latter end ℥i of Pomegranate Peel bruis'd, Red Roſes, Granate Flowers, each Mij; and then add <abbr>lb</abbr>ſs of Red Wine, ſtrain it, bath the parts affected with Flannel Cloaths dipt in it, in the Morning Two Hours before the Woman riſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and at Night when ſhe's in Bed; continue the uſe of it till the Symptom is quite gone. <hi>But enough of theſe things.</hi>

            <p>And now worthy Sir, I have mention'd the chief of what has been hitherto obſerv'd in the Hiſtory and Cure of this Diſeaſe, and have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe to do but to beg your Pardon, if I have err'd in deſcribing theſe things not ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curately as I ought to have done, and alſo to deſire you to accept favourably of this ſmall Treatiſe, which was deſignedly written to return you thanks for your approbation of my other Works: And indeed I have ſo ſeldom receiv'd any thing of this nature, that either<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd no ſuch thing, or elſe thoſe candid and ingenious Men which Nature has fram'd with ſuch excellency of Mind, as to know how to be grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,

are very few, ſcarce ſo many as the Gates of <hi>Thebes,</hi> or Entries of Wealthy <hi>Nile.</hi> Yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding I endeavour all I can, and will do ſo, to learn and promote the method of curing Diſeaſes, and to inſtruct thoſe that are leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant in practice than my ſelf, let other People have what Opinion of me they pleaſe. For ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving nicely weigh'd whether 'tis better to be beneficial to Men, or to be praiſed by them, I find the firſt preponderates, and much conduces to the tranquillity of Mind. But as for fame and popular applauſe, they are lighter than a Feather or a Bubble, and more vain than the ſhadow of a Dream. But if any one thinks that Riches got by ſuch a Reputation have ſomething more of weight in them, let them injoy what they have ſcrap'd together with all my Heart, but let them remember that ſome Mechanicks of the moſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did Trades, get and leave more to their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, yet do they not exceed the Beaſts in this, who take as much care as they can of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and theirs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and if we except things honeſt, proceeding from the judgment of the Mind and Vertue (whereof the Nature of Beaſts is not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable,) the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Beaſts are plainly as good as theſe and all others who don't endeavour to do all the good they can in their Generation.</p>

            <head>CHAP. IV. Of the Gout.</head>
            <p>WIthout doubt Men will think, that either the nature of the Diſeaſe we now treat of is almoſt incomprehenſible, or that I who have been vex'd with it Thirty Four Years, am a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dull Fellow, ſeeing my Obſervations about the Diſeaſe, and the cure of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> do little anſwer their Expectation. But however it be, I will faithfully deliver thoſe things I have hitherto learnt, the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and intricacy, reſpecting either the account of the Diſeaſe, or the Method of Cure, leaving them to be clear'd and made plain by time the guide of truth.</p>
            <p>The Gout chiefly ſeizes thoſe Old Men, who after they have lived the beſt part of their Lives tenderly and delicately, indulging themſelves freely with ſplendid Banquets, Wine, and other Spirituous Liquors; and at length having by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Sloath that always accompanies Old Age, wholly omitted thoſe Exerciſes of Body which Young Men are accuſtom'd to. Moreover they who are obnoxious to this Diſeaſe, have large Skulls, and are moſt commonly of a Groſs habit of Body, Moiſt and Laxe, and of a Luſty and Luxuriant Conſtitution, the beſt and richeſt Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for Life.</p>
            <p>Not that the Gout only ſeizes thoſe that are Corpulent, for ſometimes alſo though ſeldomer,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:57356:48"/>
it invades thin People; nor does it wait always till they are old, for ſometimes it ſeizes thoſe that are in the flower of their Age, when they have receiv'd the unhappy Seeds of the Diſeaſe from their Parents, as it were <hi>ex traduce;</hi> or if this be not the cauſe, they have too early us'd Venery, or have quite forſook violent Exerciſes that they us'd formerly; moreover they have great Stomachs, and have drank Spirituous Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors immoderately, and afterwards they have ſuddenly betook themſelves to thin and cooling Liquors.</p>
            <p>When it firſt ſeizes any one when he is very old, it never afterwards has ſuch exact Periods, nor rages ſo violently, as when it falls upon a younger Man, both becauſe he dies moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly before the Diſeaſe accompanied with its natural Symptoms can come to its heighth, and alſo becauſe the native heat and vigour of the Body being leſſen'd, it can't be ſo conſtantly and violently ſhot off upon the Joints. But if it ſeizes any one earlier, though it does not yet fix upon one part, nor handle him ſo roughly, but comes with uncertain periods upon occaſion given, pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him lightly for a few Days, coming and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without any Method, yet by degrees it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally beſieges the Man, and proceeds regularly, both as to the time 'twill come at, and as to the continuance of the Fit, and moreover aſſaults him more violently than at firſt.</p>
            <p>I will firſt Diſcourſe of this Diſeaſe as it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds regularly, and afterwards of its anomalous and uncertain Phaenomena, when being put out of its courſe, either by a praepoſterous uſe of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper

Medicines, or by the weakneſs of the Subject, it can't attain to its proper and genuine Symptoms. Therefore when the Gout is regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, it ſeizes the Patient moſt commonly after this manner, about the latter end of <hi>January,</hi> or the beginning of <hi>February,</hi> it comes ſuddenly, and for the moſt part without giving any notice, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that the Patient has been troubled with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digeſtion and crudities of the Stomach ſome Weeks before; moreover the Body is oppreſs'd and puff'd up with Wind, which daily increaſes till the Fit thunders upon him; but a few Days before it comes, the Thighs are benumm'd, and there is as it were a diſcent of Wind through the Fleſh of them, with Convulſive Motions, and the day before the Fit the Appetite is ſharp, but not natural. He goes to Bed and to Sleep well, but about Two a Clock in the Morning is wak'd by the pain, ſeizing either his great Toe, the Heel, the Calf of the Leg, or the Ancle; this Pain is like that of diſlocated Bones, with the ſenſe as it were of Water almoſt cold, pour'd upon the Membranes of the Parts affected, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſhivering or ſhaking follow, with a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſh Diſpoſition; the Pain is firſt gentle, but increaſes by degrees, (and in like manner the ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering and ſhaking go off,) and that hourly till towards Night it comes to its heighth, accomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dating it ſelf neatly according to the variety of the Bones of the Tarſus and Metatarſus, whoſe Ligaments it ſeizes, ſometimes reſembling a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſtretching or tearing of thoſe Ligaments, ſometimes the gnawing of a Dog, and ſometimes a preſſure; moreover the part affected has ſuch a
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:57356:50"/>
quick and exquiſite pain, that 'tis not able to bear the weight of Cloaths upon it, nor hard Walking in the Chamber; and the Night is not paſs'd over in pain upon this account only, but alſo by reaſon of the reſtleſs turning of the part hither and thither<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the continual change of its place. Nor is the toſſing of the whole Body, which always accompanies the Fit, but eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at its coming, leſs than the continual agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and pain of the tormented Member. There are a Thouſand fruitleſs endeavours us'd to eaſe the pain by a continual change of the place where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Body and the affected Members lye, yet there is no eaſe to be had, 'till Two or Three a Clock in the Morning <hi>(viz.</hi> a Night and a Day being ſpent from the firſt approach of the Fit,) at which time the Sick has ſuddenly eaſe, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon there's a little Digeſtion of the peccant Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſome diſcuſſion of it, though he unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly attributes it to that poſition of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected part he us'd laſt. And now being in a breathing Sweat, he falls aſleep; when he wakes, he finds the pain much abated, and the part af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected ſwell'd afreſh; for before there was only (which is uſual in the Fits of thoſe that have the Gout,) viſible, a Swelling of the Veins intermix'd with the affected Member. The next day, and perhaps Two or Three days after, if the matter apt to genetrate, the Gout is copious, the part affected will be in pain, which will be violent too towards Evening, but 'twill be eaſed about the time of the Cock's Crowing; within a few Days the other Foot will be in pain, as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer was, and if the former has left off aking,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:57356:51"/>
the weakneſs which render'd it infirm will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently vaniſh, ſtrength and perfect Health being ſo preſently reſtor'd, as if it had never been out of order, if the pain is violent in the Foot late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeiz'd. And yet it acts the ſame Tragedy in the other Foot as it did in the former, both as to the violence of the Pain, and the duration of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſometimes on the firſt Days of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe, when the Peccant Matter is ſo exuberant, that one Foot is unable to contain it, it afflicts both at the ſame time with the like violence; but moſt commonly it ſeizes them ſucceſſively as we ſaid: After it has vex'd the Feet, the Fits that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low are irregular, both as to the time of Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Duration, yet the pain always returns in the Evening, and is leſs in the Morning, and of a Series of theſe ſmall Fits, conſiſts that which is call'd a Fit of the Gout, longer or ſhorter, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Age of the Sick; for 'tis not to be ſuppoſed, that when any one is afflicted with this Diſeaſe two or three Months, that that's one Fit, but rather a Series and Chain of ſmall Fits, whereof every latter is gentler and ſhorter than the former, till at length the peccant Matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wholly conſum'd, the Patient recovers his former Health, which in thoſe that are brisk, and in others whom the Gout has rarely viſited, comes to paſs often in Fourteen Days, and in thoſe it has often afflicted in Two Months; but in thoſe who are more debilitated, either by the long continuance of the Diſeaſe, or by age; it does not go off till Summer coming pretty well on, drives it away. The firſt Fourteen Days the Urine is high Colour'd, which after Separatión
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:57356:51"/>
puts off a red Sediment, and as it were full of ſmall Sand; nor does the Patient render by U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine more than the third part of what he Drinks, and the Belly is moſt commonly bound the ſaid firſt Days, want of Appetite, ſhaking of the whole Body about Evening, heavineſs and a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſom uneaſineſs of the parts that are not affected, accompanies the whole Fit, a violent itching of the Foot affected, follows the departing Fit, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially betwixt the Toes, and the Feet ſcale as if the Sick had been Poiſon'd. The Diſeaſe being diſcuſs'd, a good habit of Body and Appetite re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, according to the degree of Pain with which the Fit laſt paſt rag'd; and ſo proportionably the following Fit will be haſten'd or deferr'd, for if the laſt Fit was very ſevere, the following Fit will not come, till the ſame time of the Year re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn again.</p>
            <p>And in this manner, the regular Gout ſhews it ſelf with its genuine and proper Phaenomena, but when 'tis diſturb'd by improper methods of Cure, or by the obſtinate continuance of the Diſeaſe, the very ſubſtance of the Body being as it were, perverted to the Nouriſhment of the Diſeaſe; and Nature unable to eliminate the ſame by its wonted method, then the Phaenomena are much different from thoſe deſcrib'd. For whereas the Pain was hitherto only troubleſome to the Feet, (which are the genuine ſeat of the peccant matter, and if it poſſeſſes any other Parts, 'tis moſt certain, that either the method of the Diſeaſe has been alter'd, or that the vigor of the Body, is by little and little diminiſh'd) now it poſſeſſes the Hands, Wriſts, the Arms, the Knees, and other regions,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:57356:52"/>
tormenting theſe, as much as it us'd to do the Feet: For ſometimes diſtorting one or more of the Fingers, it makes them like a bunch of Parſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nips, taking away the motion by degrees, and at length it generates Stony Concretions about the ligaments of the Joints, which deſtroying the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, and the very Skin of the Joints, renders viſible, naked Stones, like Chalk or Crabs eyes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which may be pick'd out with a Needle. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the matter occaſioning the Diſeaſe thruſt upon the Arms, cauſes a whitiſh Swelling, almoſt as big as an Egg; which is by degrees inflam'd with Redneſs, ſometimes falling upon the Thigh, it feels as if there were a great Weight hanging upon it; yet without any conſiderable Pain, but paſſing to the Knee, it handles that more ſeverely, ſo hindering all motions, that 'tis as 'twere, nail'd to the Bed: So that it can't move a Hairs-bredth from the place wherein it is. And when by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the reſtleſſneſs of the Body, or to eaſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the Patient muſt be mov'd by the help of others, there's need of great care, leſt by chance, the leaſt contrariety of motion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhou'd occaſion Pain, which for this reaſon only, is tollerable, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe it preſently vaniſhes: And indeed, this carrying of the Body, that muſt be perform'd ſo carefully and tenderly, is not a ſmall part of the Troubles, wherewith the Gout is burden'd; for the pain is not violent through all the Fit, if the part affected, be kept quiet.</p>
            <p>Whereas the Gout before, did not uſe to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade before the latter end of Winter, and was wont to go off, after two or three Months, now it continues upon the Sick a whole year, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:57356:52"/>
only two or three of the hot Summer Months: And what is moreover to be obſerv'd, as the great and general Fit is longer than heretofore it was, ſo thoſe particular Fits, whereof the general is compounded, rage longer; for whereas before thoſe particular Fits did not torment the Patient above a day or two, now wherever it fixes, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if it poſſeſſes the Feet or Knees, it does not ceaſe, till the Tenth or Fourteenth day, moreover the Firſt or Second day after its coming, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient feels ſome Sickneſs, beſides the Pain, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a total proſtration of the Appetite.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, before the Diſeaſe was grown to ſuch a heigth, the Sick did not only enjoy longer Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals of the Fits, but alſo during that Intermiſſion, he was well in his Limbs, and in the other parts of Body, all the natural Faculties performing their Offices duly; but now his Limbs are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted and cumbred, ſo that tho' he can ſtand, and perhaps go a little, yet he creeps along ſo very lamely and troubleſomely, that when he walks, he ſeems to ſtand ſtill; and if he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to walk beyond his ſtrength, that he may the better recover his Feet, the more he confirms them by walking, and renders them leſs apt to receive the pain, ſo much the more the Fomes of the Diſeaſe not perfectly diſſipated by all this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval, hovers more dangerouſly about the Bowels, when it can't be ſo freely diſcharg'd upon the Feet, which at this time of the Diſeaſe, are ſcarce ever free from pain, but are always uneaſie more or leſs.</p>
            <p>The Sick is alſo afflicted with many other Symptoms, as with a Pain of the Haemorrhoidal
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:57356:53"/>
Veins, with unſavoury Belchings, reſembling the taſte of the Meat laſt eat, putrifying in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, when ſomething of hard Digeſtion is eaten, or only ſo much as is requiſite for People in Health, the Appetite Languiſhes, and alſo the whole Body, by reaſon of a penury of Spirits. Laſtly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He lives only to be wretched and miſerable, and not at all to taſte of the Happineſs of Life. The Urine that us'd to be formerly high colour'd, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the Fits, and render'd in a ſmall quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, now is like that, both for colour and quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity which is evacuated in a <hi>Diabetes:</hi> The Back and other Parts, itch troubleſomely about Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time.</p>
            <p>And this Incovenience alſo happens in this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, when 'tis confirm'd, <hi>viz.</hi> that upon yawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, eſpecially in the morning, the ligaments of the Bones of the Metatarſus, are violently pull'd, and ſeem to be hardly preſs'd with a ſtrong Hand; and ſometimes when yawning does not go before, the Sick juſt dropping aſleep, ſuddenly feels a Blow as it were of a Club, breaking in pieces the Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarſus; ſo that he wakes crying out: The Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons of the Muſcles that ſuſtain the Legs, are ſometimes taken with ſuch a ſharp and violent Convulſion, that the pain which it occaſions, if it ſhould laſt but a little while, would overcome all Humane Patience. After many and dreadful Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and long execution, the following Fits as to Pain are more gentle, as a pledge of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge which approaching Death is about to give, (Nature being partly oppreſs'd by the burden of the Peccant Matter, and partly by Old Age, is no more able to expel it conſtantly and forceably
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:57356:53"/>
to the extremities of the Body,) but inſtead of the accuſtom'd Pain, a certain Sickneſs with a pain of the Belly, Spontaneous wearineſs, and ſometime a propenſion to a Diarrhaea ſupervene. Theſe Symptoms eaſe the pain of the Limbs when they are violent, and likewiſe vaniſh when the Pain is in the Joints; and ſometimes the Pain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſometimes the Sickneſs afflicting alternative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, prolong the Fits much. For 'tis to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that when any one has had the Gout many Years, the Pain is by degrees leſſen'd every Fit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and at length he dies more of the Sickneſs than the Pain: For the Pain which is in theſe Fits<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though 'tis longer, yet is it not the Tenth of that which he us'd to ſuffer when his Strength was more intire. But this Severity of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe is compenſated moſt commonly by the longer ſpace betwixt the Fits, and by the good Health he in the mean while enjoys. For in this Diſeaſe, pain is Nature's moſt bitter Medicine; and the more violent it is, the ſooner will the Fit paſs over, and the longer will be the intermiſſion and more perfect, and ſo on the contrary.</p>
            <p>Nor does the Pain, the lameneſs, and the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed motion of the affected parts, the Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and other Symptoms deſcrib'd, compleat the Tragedy of this Diſeaſe: For it breeds the Stone of the Kidnies in very many, either becauſe the Sick lies long upon his Back, or becauſe the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans of Secretion have ceas'd to perform their due Functions, or for that the Stone is made of a part of the ſame kind of Matter, but which is the cauſe I ſhall not determine; whatever is the origine of this Diſeaſe, the Sick has ſometimes
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:57356:54"/>
many ſad Contemplations, to know whether the Stone or the Gout is moſt ſevere; and ſometimes the Stone hindering the paſſage of the Water in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Bladder through the Urinary Paſſages kills him, not waiting any longer upon the Slow Gouty Execution. Nor is it enough that the Sick is tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented in ſuch a Miſerable manner, as that he can't help himſelf, but wants the help of others, but this is alſo added to the heap of his Sorrows<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>viz.</hi> that during the Fit, his Mind is as it were affected with the Contagion, and ſo far ſuffers with the Body, that 'tis difficult to ſay which of them is moſt afflicted, for every Fit may as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be call'd a Fit of Anger, as of the Gout, for the Mind and Reaſon are ſo extreamly ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated by the infirm Body, that they are diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd by the leaſt motion of the Affections, ſo that he's as troubleſom to others, as to himſelf: Moreover he is as obnoxious to the reſt of the Paſſions, <hi>viz.</hi> to fear, care, and others of the ſame kind, by which he's alſo vex'd, till the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe going off, the Mind alſo has recover'd its former tranquillity.</p>
            <p>At length the Sick (that I may diſpatch the Cataſtrophe of this dreadful Diſeaſe,) his Bowels being ſo hurt by hatching and embracing the Peccant Matter, that the Organs of Secretion can no longer perform their Office, upon which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the Blood ſtuff'd with Faeculencies ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates, and the peccant Matter is not as heretofore caſt upon the extream parts of the Body; at length I ſay the thrice Miſerable Wretch is ſo happy as to Dye.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:57356:54"/>
But (which may be a comfort to me and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that are afflicted with this Diſeaſe, though we are but moderately furniſh'd with Mony and the Graces of the Mind,) ſo liv'd and ſo died great Kings and Potentates, Generals of Armies, and Admirals of Fleets, Philoſophers, and many ſuch as theſe. In a word, this Diſeaſe of the Joints (which can ſcarce be ſaid of any other,) kills more Rich than Poor, more Wiſe Men than Fools, Nature ſhewing as it were with the Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger how juſt the Parent and Diſpoſer of all things is, and how little he ſides with Parties; for thoſe that want ſomething, are wont to be abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repleniſh'd with an other kind of good, and he allayes profuſe munificence, by mixing an equal ſhare of Miſeries with it; ſo that 'tis every where inviolably decreed, that no Man ſhall be perfectly happy, or compleatly miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, but that all ſhall partake of both Lots, which mixture of good and ill, ſo proper to our frailty and mortality, is perhaps very fit for us.</p>
            <p>Women are very ſeldom troubl'd with the Gout, and if they are, not till they are Old or of a Maſculine habit of Body: Thin Women who in their Youth or Middle Age are troubled with Symptoms reſembling the Gout, receive them from Hyſterical Diſeaſes, or a Rheumatiſm which they were afflicted with here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, the Fomes whereof was not well carried off.</p>
            <p>Nor have I hitherto obſerv'd that Boys or Youths are vext with the true and genuine Gout, yet ſome that I have known, have perceived ſome
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:57356:55"/>
ſmall touches of it, before they have arriv'd to that Age, <hi>viz.</hi> when their Fathers had this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe when they begat them. And here ends the Hiſtory of the Diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>Having very much contemplated the various phaenomena of this Diſeaſe, I ſuppoſe it ariſes from the Concoction weaken'd, both in the parts, and in all the Juices of the Body; for in thoſe who are ſubject to this Diſeaſe, they being either worn out by Age, or having by Intemperance haſtened Old Age, the Animal Spirits are decay'd through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Body, being conſum'd by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate exerciſe of the brisk Functions in the heat of Youth, for inſtance, by too early, or too much uſe of Venery, by Mad and Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Labours, whereby they unweariedly ſerve their pleaſures; to which is to be added a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den intermiſſion or ceſſation from the Exerciſes of the Body, to which they have been heretofore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed, either by reaſon of Years or Lazineſs, (by the uſe whereof the Blood was wont to be render'd more vigorous, and the tone of the parts more firm,) upon which account the Body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes now wither'd, and the concoctions are no more rightly perform'd; but on the contrary the droſs of the Juices of the Body which were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd before by the help of ſuch Exerciſes, are from henceforth laid up in the Veſſels, as a Stock for the Diſeaſe. And ſometimes hard Study or Meditation concerning ſome ſerious and laſting Matter, has increas'd the Diſeaſe, whereby the Fine and Volatile Spirits are too much diverted from their buſineſs of Concoction, which they ought to perform. Moreover they that are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:57356:55"/>
to this Diſeaſe, are not only moſt commonly greedy of Meats in general, but chiefly of thoſe that are hardeſt to digeſt, whereof when they eat as much as they were wont to do when they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed themſelves, they are unable to digeſt them. Nor does the ſaid voracity or full feeding, ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently (though it does often) occaſion the Gout, as the immoderate and mad drinking of Wine, whereby the ferments appointed for various Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coctions are wholly deſtroy'd, and the Concocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons themſelves, and the natural Spirits are van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh'd and diſpers'd by the great quantity of adventitious Vapours. But when at one and the ſame time, the vigour of the Spirits that are the Inſtruments of Concoction are leſſen'd, and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over a great haep of Humours oppreſſes the Blood, 'tis impoſſible that all the Concoctions ſhould be duly perform'd, when all the <hi>Viſcera</hi> are ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm'd, upon which account the Spirits long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go weaken'd, are now ſuffocated. For if this were occaſion'd only by a weakneſs of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, Women and Children, and thoſe which long Sickneſs has waſted, would likewiſe be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded by it; whereas for the moſt part it ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes the Strongeſt, and thoſe that have the moſt robuſt Principles of Nature: Yet it does not ſeize them, 'till Humours are heapt up, by reaſon of the defect and declination of the Natural Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, by which join'd together the vitiated Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coctions are perverted.</p>
            <p>Moreover as every one of the cauſes we have mention'd, promote indigeſtion, ſo moſt of them occaſion a Looſeneſs of the habit and muſcules of the Body, by which means a paſſage is open'd for
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:57356:56"/>
the receiving crude and indigeſted Humours, as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as they are protruded to the outward parts, and when lying long in the Blood, they increaſe in bulk and contract an ill Diſpoſition, and at length acquire a putrifying heat, and can no longer be govern'd by Nature, they break forth into a Species, and fall upon the Joints, and by heat and ſharpneſs occaſion moſt exquiſite pains in the Ligaments and Membranes covering the Bones, which being either weaken'd and looſen'd by Age, or by Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or Intemperance, make room for them, when they make an attempt; but this falling of the Humours that generate the Gout, which conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes the Fit, happens ſooner or later, as occaſion is offer'd for putting theſe Humours into mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>As to the cure, (I will firſt mention thoſe things that are to be omitted,) though if we reſpect the Humours and the Indigeſtion whereby they are occaſion'd, it may ſeem at firſt, that the curative indications are chiefly to be directed for the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacution of the Humours already made, and for corroborating the Concoctions; ſo that the heap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of other Humours may be prevented<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> foraſmuch as theſe are the more general Indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whereby we ſhould do the buſineſs in moſt other humoral Diſeaſes; but in the Gout there's a kind of prerogative in Nature, for extermina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Peccant Matter after its own way, by putting it off upon the Joints, and by diſcuſſing it by inſenſible tranſpiration.</p>
            <p>About Three ways are propos'd, whereby we may eject the containing cauſe of the Gout, <hi>viz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Bleeding, Purging and Sweating, and yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:57356:56"/>
of theſe Methods will ever perform the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Though Bleeding may ſeem both to Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuate thoſe Humours that are juſt ready for a deſcent, and alſo thoſe that have already be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged the Joints, yet it plainly oppoſes that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication, which the antecedent cauſe, that is, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digeſtion, ariſing from a depravation and defect of the Spirits, (which Bleeding leſſens and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes more) requires, and therefore Bleeding is not to be us'd, either to prevent the Fit which is fear'd, or to mitigate that which is now preſent, namely, in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thoſe that are old; for though that Blood that is drawn out, is moſt commonly like that of Pleuriticks, and of thoſe that have a Rheumatiſm, yet Bleeding does as much hurt to the Sick in this Diſeaſe, as it does good in the Two juſt mention'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for if Blood is extracted in the intermiſſion, though a good while after the Fit, there's danger leſt by the agitation of the Blood and Humours, a new Fit ſhould be occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd more laſting than the former, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with more violent Symptoms, the ſtrength and vigour of the Blood being blunted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, by the help of which the nouriſhment of the Diſeaſe ſhould have been diligently and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly expell'd.</p>
            <p>And this inconvenience happens as often as Bleeding is us'd at the beginning of the Fit, and if it be us'd preſently after the Fit, there's great danger, leſt Nature, the Blood having not yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd its former ſtrength, weaken'd by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe, ſhould be ſo much dejected by this unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably us'd, that a Dropſie ſhould be occaſion'd
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:57356:57"/>
thereby. But if the Sick is yet Young, and has been over-heated by hard Drinking, Blood may be drawn at the beginning of the Fit; but if in the following Fits it is continually us'd, the Gout is ſoon confirm'd even in Youth, and will more propagate its Tyranny in a few Years, than other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in a great many.</p>
            <p>And then as to Purging, whether upward or down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, this muſt be noted, that whereas by the invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable Law of Nature annex'd to the very eſſence of this Diſeaſe, the Fomes of it ought to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd always to the Joints; Emetick or Cathar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Remedies will do nothing elſe, but recal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Blood the Peccant Matter, which was put off by Nature upon the Extremities of the Body; upon which account that which ought to be caſt upon the Joints, ruſhes perhaps upon ſome of the <hi>Viſcera,</hi> and ſo the Patient's Life is in danger, when before 'twas not in danger at all. Which is often obſerv'd to be fatal to thoſe who have been accuſtom'd to Purging Medicines, that they might prevent the Gout, (or which is worſe,) to leſſen the Fit: For when Nature is put by her uſual method, whereby as being beſt and more ſecure, ſhe drives the Morbifick Matter upon the Joints, the Humours are turn'd inward upon the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines, and inſtead of Pain in the Joints, where there is none at all, or certainly but very little, the poor Wretches are almoſt deſtroy'd by Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach Sickneſs, Gripes and Faintings, with a great troop of irregular Symptoms.</p>
            <p>Therefore I am fully perſwaded, having learnt by continual and repeated experience, that all Purging whether by gentle or ſtrong Medicines,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:57356:57"/>
ſuch as are uſually deſign'd to purge the Joints, do much hurt, whether it's us'd in the Fit to leſſen the Peccant Matter, or at the end to diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate the Relicks of the Diſeaſe, or in a perfect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion or good health, to hinder the approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fit. For I have found at my own peril, as well as of others, that Catharticks adminiſtred at any of theſe times, have been ſo far from doing good, that they have haſten'd the Miſchief they ſhould have prevented. Firſt therefore Purging when the Fit rages, diſturbing Nature when ſhe is buſied in ſeparating the Morbifick Matter, and in putting it off upon the Joints, ſometimes occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions a great confuſion of the Spirits, ſo that the Fit is not only increas'd thereby, but the Patient's Life alſo is not a little hazarded; and then Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharticks us'd at the end of the Fit, inſtead of removing the Relicks of the Diſeaſe, bring on another Fit afreſh, as bad as the former, and thus the Sick being vainly deceiv'd, contrives Miſery for himſelf, which he had not felt, if the Humours had not been inrag'd again: Which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience I have found often, having prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterouſly crav'd for Medical help, to expel as I thought the relicks of the Diſeaſe. Laſtly, As to Purging to be repeated at certain intervals, and in perfect Health, to prevent the Fit, though which muſt be confeſs'd, there is not ſo much danger of a new Fit, as in the caſe juſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, when the Patient was not wholly freed, yet at this time it produces a Fit; and if by chance the Patient is not preſently ſeiz'd, yet it does not at all free him from the Diſeaſe, though he take this or that Purge conſtantly at
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:57356:58"/>
due diſtances, for I have known ſome obnoxious to this Diſeaſe, who have not Purg'd only at Spring and Autumn, but alſo Monthly and Week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they might recover their Health, and yet none of theſe have eſcaped the Gout, for moſt commonly it handl'd them more cruelly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, and with worſe Symptoms than if they had taken no Phyſick at all. For though the ſaid Purging might take away ſome part of the containing cauſe, yet no way conducing to the corroboration of Concoction (ſo far from that is it, that it debilitates the ſame, and wounds Nature afreſh,) it oppoſes only one cauſe, and ſo is wholly unable to cure the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe.</p>
            <p>But this muſt be noted moreover, that from the ſame defect of the Spirits, whereby the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coctions are vitiated, in thoſe who are wont to have the Gout, the frame of the ſame Animal Spirits is render'd leſs firm and vigorous, ſo that 'tis preſently diſturb'd by any cauſe, whereby the Mind or Body is ſomewhat violently mov'd, and ſo very fleeting and ſhatter'd is it, as it happens to thoſe that are ſubject to Hyſterick and Hypochondriacal Diſeaſes. From which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of the Spirits to be diſturb'd, it comes to paſs that the Gout moſt commonly follows the leaſt evacuation. The tone of the Body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſſolv'd, which the firmneſs of the Spirits whilſt they continue vigorous, keeps compact and brisk, the Peccant Matter moves without reſiſtance; and by this injury to the Body a Fit is preſently occaſion'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:57356:58"/>
But how pernicious ſoever this Method is, yet ſome Empericks are much eſteem'd for it, by cunningly concealing the Purging Medicine they uſe; for it muſt be obſerv'd, that during the Purging, the Patient has little or no Pain at all; and if Purging could be continu'd many Days, and no new Fit ſupervene, the Sick would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently recover of that he has now upon him; but truly he will be dreadfully puniſh'd after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by the confuſion into which the ſaid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation of the Humours has precipitated Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, The Evacuation of the Peccant Matter by Sweat, though it does leſs hurt than the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Evacuations, yet it plainly appears to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious, for though it don't draw back the Fomes of the Diſeaſe into the Bowels, but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, drives it to the habit of the Body; yet for theſe Reaſons it does hurt. Firſt indeed becauſe when the Fit is off, it forces the Humours as yet crude and not prepar'd for Separation, upon the Limbs, by which means it brings the Fit before its time, and contrary to Nature's conſent; and then becauſe the forcing of Sweat in the Fit, does caſt the Morbifick Matter too violently up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the affected Member, and occaſions at the ſame time an intollerable pain; and if the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of the Peccant Matter is greater than can be contained in the affected part, it forces it preſently upon other Members, and upon which account there is a great Ebullition and Fury of the Blood and other Humours; and if the Body abounds very much with ſerous Matter, fit to generate the Gout, there's danger leſt an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexy
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:57356:59"/>
ſhould be occaſion'd. Wherefore in this Diſeaſe as well as in all other, wherein Sweat is provok'd by Art, to caſt forth the Morbifick Matter, and does not come naturally, 'tis very dangerous to force them out too violently, and beyond that degree of Concoction whereunto the Humours to be evacuated have come of their own accord. And that excellent Aphoriſm of <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates, that things concocted, not crude, are to be me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated,</hi> is of as much uſe in provoking Sweat, as in Purging the Belly, which is very apparent in that Sweat that uſes to come at the latter end of Agues, which if it is moderate and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the concocted quantity of Febrile Matter of the preceding Fit, much relieves the Sick; but if it's forc'd beyond Nature's bounds, by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Sick continually a-bed, a continual Fever is occaſion'd, and inſtead of extinguiſhing the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Fire, a new one is kindled. In like manner in the Gout, that gentle Breathing Sweat which moſt commonly comes in the Morning of its own accord after each of the ſmall Fits, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of as I have ſaid the great Fit conſiſts, mitigates both the pain and reſtleſſneſs, wherewith the Sick has conflicted all the Night. But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, when at any time this gentle breathing Sweat that naturally ſoon goes off, is provoked longer and more violently than the proportion of Peccant Matter requires, the Diſeaſe is encreas'd thereby. Therefore in this Diſeaſe and in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I have ever ſeen, except the Plague only, 'tis not ſo much the Phyſicians, as Nature's bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs to force Sweat, becauſe we can't know by any means what part of Matter is already pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:57356:59"/>
for ſuch a Separation, and by conſequence what Meaſures we are to take in provoking it.</p>
            <p>Now ſeeing it plainly appears from what has been ſaid, that 'tis not only in vain to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the cure of the Gout by Evacuating Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, but that they are alſo injurious to Gouty People, it remains, that we inquire to what other end the curative Indications are to be directed. I indeed having accurately weigh'd, and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently examin'd the foreſaid Phaenomena, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from thence that we muſt have reſpect to two cauſes chiefly in the cure of this Diſeaſe; the firſt is the Antecedent cauſe, or the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion of the Humours ariſing from a defect of heat and natural Spirits; the other is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining cauſe, or the heat and boiling of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, when they are putrified and grown ſharp by remaining too long in the Body, which their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay is occaſion'd by the indigeſtion above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd: Theſe Cauſes are ſo abſolutely contrary one to the other, that thoſe Remedies that do good for this, are injurious for the other; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which account this Diſeaſe is ſo very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultly Cur'd. For when we endeavour to remove Indigeſtion by hot Medicines, there's danger leſt on the other hand we increaſe the heat of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours; and when on the contrary we would mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigate the hot and acrid Humours, either by cooling Remedies or Diet, we occaſion Indige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, the natural Heat being weaken'd. But here by the containing cauſe, I don't only mean that which actually beſieging the Joints, forms the Fit, but that moreover which lurking in the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:57356:60"/>
Blood, is yet unfit for Separation; for all the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bifick Matter is very ſeldom ſo clearly ejected, how long and ſevere ſoever the Fit has been, as that there are no relicks of it in the Body, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Paroxiſm is gone off, and therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard muſt be had to this cauſe, as well when the Fit is off, as when it rages. But foraſmuch as the ejection of the containing Matter is wholly Nature's Buſineſs, it muſt be done by her Method alone, for nothing can be in the mean time at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to aſſwage the hot and acrid Humours, without injury to the Digeſtions, only the Sick muſt forbear hot Medicines and Diet whereby the Humours are inflam'd; ſo that certainly the greateſt and chiefeſt intention of Curing, conſiſts in helping Concoction, by removing Indigeſtions, of which I will now treat, yet ſo as that in the ſeries of my Diſcourſe, I may touch upon thoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies occaſionally, which conduce to the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaging of the Heat, and ſharpneſs of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours.</p>
            <p>Therefore whatever helps Nature in duly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming her offices, either by ſtrengthening the Stomach, that it may concoct the nouriſhment well, or the Blood, that it may duly aſſimilate the Chyle brought into it, or by ſtrengthening the Solid Parts that they may the better convert the Juices deſign'd for their nouriſhment and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, into their proper ſubſtance. Laſtly, Whatever preſerves the Organs of Excretion, and the emunctories of the Body, in that ſtate whereby the Faeculencies of each part may in due time and order be carried off, theſe and all things of this kind conduce to the fulfilling this
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:57356:60"/>
intention, and are properly call'd Digeſtives, whether they are Medicines, or a Rule for Diet or Exerciſe, or any other of thoſe things which are call'd the Six Non-naturals.</p>
            <p>Theſe kind of Medicines in general, are thoſe which moderately heat, and are either bitter, or gently bite the Tongue, for they are very agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Stomach, they purifie the Blood, and comfort the other Parts. For inſtance, they are ſuch as theſe Roots of Angelica, Elecampane, the Leaves of Wormwood, the leſſer Centaury, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, Groundpine, &amp;c. alſo thoſe that are vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly call'd Anti-ſcorbuticks may be added, as the Roots of Horſe-Radiſh, the Leaves of Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Scurvy-Graſs, Water-Creſſes, and the like. But yet theſe acrid and pungent Herbs, how pleaſing ſoever they are to the Stomach, and how much ſoever they help Concoction, are to be us'd more ſparingly than others that corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate the Stomach by their gentle heat and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs, and render the Maſs of Blood more brisk and lively, for they ſtir up the Fomes of the Diſeaſe that has been long form'd, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the Heat.</p>
            <p>Some Species of them neatly mix'd, are better in my Opinion to concoct the Humours, than any one Simple of their Tribe. For though when we have need of the Specifick Vertue of any Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, that Rule holds good, <hi>the ſimpler 'tis, the better 'tis;</hi> but when we deſign to cure the Sick by ſatisfying this or that Indication, every In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient contributes ſomewhat for the cure of the Diſeaſe; and in this caſe the greater the number of Simples is, the more powerfully does
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:57356:61"/>
the Medicine work; therefore various forms of Medicines tending to this end, may be neatly fram'd of the foreſaid, and of the reſt of the <hi>Materia Medica</hi> of this ſort. I prefer an Electu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary before the reſt made like Venice-Treacle, as the moſt excellent, for that a mutual Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Simples, increaſes the vertue of them all, as if it produc'd ſome third thing, which in the things ſo join'd, has greater vertue than any one of them in the ſame quantity. But I wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly leave the choice of ſuch Ingredients, and the forms wherein they are to be given, to the prudent Phyſician; for I never thought it my buſineſs to write Receipts as they call them, but rather to note the Indications, according to which the Methods of Cure are to be directed; and this being not well minded, is the cauſe why Empericks boaſt that they are the chief of the Medical art.</p>
            <p>But for the benefit of Beginners, I will ſet down the remedy I am wont to uſe, which is compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after this manner.</p>
            <p>Take of the Roots of Angelica, of the ſweet Smell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Flag, of Maſterwort, Elecampane, of the Leaves of Common Wormwood, of the leſſer Centaury, of white Whore-hound, of Germander, of Ground-pine, of Scordium, of common Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laminth, of Feverfew, of Field Saxifrage, St. John's-wort, Golden-Rod, Thime, Mint, Sage, Rue, Carduus B. Penny-Royal, Sothernwood, of the Flower of Chamomel, Tanſie, Lilly of the Vallies, Engliſh Saffron, of the Seeds of Treacle Muſtard, Garden Scurvy-Graſs, Carraway, Juniper-Berries, each a ſufficient quantity; let
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:57356:61"/>
the Herbs and Flowers and Roots be gather'd when they have moſt vertue in them; let them be dry'd, and kept in Paper Bags till they may be finely powder'd; to ſix Ounces of each well mixt, add a ſufficient quantity of purified Hony and Canary Wine, to make an Electuary; take <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ij Morning and Evening. Or for want of this, uſe the following.</p>
            <p>Take of the Conſerve of Garden Scurvy-graſs ℥iſs, of Roman Wormwood, and of the Yellow Rind of Oranges, each ℥i, of Candied Angelica, of Nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>megs Candied, each ℥ſs, of Venice Treacle, <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>iij, of Compound Powder of Wake Robin <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ij, make an Electuary, with a ſufficient quantity of Syrup of Oranges; let him take <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ij twice a day, drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon it Five or Six Spoonfuls of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Water.</p>
            <p>Take of the Roots of Horſe-Radiſh ſlic'd ℥iij, of Garden Scurvy-graſs, <hi>M.</hi> xij, of Water Creſſes and Brook-lime, of Sage and Mint, each <hi>M.</hi> iiij, the Peel of Six Oranges, two Nutmegs bruis'd, of Brunſwick Mum <abbr>lb</abbr> xij, diſtil them in a common Still, and draw only Six Pints of Water for uſe.</p>
            <p>Among the Medicines commonly known, Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice Treacle is the beſt to corroborate the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coctions; but becauſe it contains a great many Species that heat too much, and beſides, a great deal of Opium, the Electuary above-mention'd may be more commodiouſly prepar'd of the chief heating Vegetables; but we muſt take care to chooſe ſuch Simples as are pleaſant to the Taſte, for the Sick muſt take it a long while, <hi>viz.</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as long as he lives, and therefore 'tis very
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:57356:62"/>
requiſite that they ſhould be palatable; among the Simples; the Peruvian Bark is the beſt, for it ſtrengthens the Blood, and renders it vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous, if ſome Grains of it are taken Morning and Evening.</p>
            <p>And truly as in this Diſeaſe we now treat of, ſo in moſt other Chronical Diſeaſes, theſe and ſuch like Remedies that ſtrengthen the Blood, and render it Brisk (if their heat don't conſiſt of Vinous Spirits, for reaſons to be ſhewn here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,) do moſt good, foraſmuch as every Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe of this kind, if I conjecture right, ought to be referr'd to one and the ſame cauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the indigeſtion of the Humours.</p>
            <p>But it can no way be made more apparent and better prov'd, than by ſetting in view the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence that is betwixt Acute and Chronical Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes; wherefore I hope the Reader will not take it amiſs, if I do a little digreſs from the buſineſs in hand. As therefore thoſe for the moſt part are accounted Acute Diſeaſes, which either ſoon kill, or are brought to Concoction, ſo thoſe are Chronical Diſeaſes which either are not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted at all, or require a long time for their Concoction; and indeed the very nature of the thing, as well as the words by which 'tis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd, plainly ſignifie as much; but the cauſe of this difference which is perceiv'd betwixt theſe two kinds of Diſeaſes, is more obſcure, and not eaſily to be clear'd. I ſuppoſe 'twill be worth our labour, to ſpend a little time in the ſearch after it, for the clear and diſtinct knowledge of theſe things, contributes much towards the finding out
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:57356:62"/>
true and agreeable Indications for the cure of theſe Diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>Whether the innermoſt Bowels of the Earth, if it's proper to ſay ſo, undergo various changes, upon which account the Air is infected by Vapours exhaling from thence, which ſeems very probable to me, or whether the whole At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphaere is infected by an alteration occaſion'd by a certain Conjunction of Heavenly Bodies: 'Tis moſt certain, that for this ſpace of time, the Air is ſtuff'd with Particles which are injurious to the oeconomy of the Human Body; and that at another time 'tis impregnated with ſuch Particles, as are Enemies to the Bodies of ſome ſpecies of Beaſts. When at theſe times we breath into the naked Blood, the noxious Venom that's an Enemy to Nature, and fall into thoſe Epidemical Diſeaſes which that is apt to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, Nature produces a Fever, its uſual en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine to free the Blood from any diſagreeable Matter that lodges within; and ſuch Diſeaſes are commonly reckon'd Epidemical, and are therefore acute and ſhort, becauſe they have ſo quick and violent a motion. But beſides theſe Diſeaſes occaſion'd by an External cauſe, there are others as acute, proceeding from this or that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Inflammation of the Blood, which don't de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on any general cauſe from the Air, but on a particular irregularity or intemperies of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Bodies, which kind of Fevers I call Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current and Sporadick, which happen almoſt in all Years.</p>
            <p>But Chronical Diſeaſes have quite another genius, for though an unhealthy Air of this

or that kind may conduce much to the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting theſe Diſeaſes, yet they don't ſo immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately take their riſe from the Air, but moſt commonly to the indigeſtion of the Humours, the common Parent of them all. For when any one has the Principles of his Nature weaken'd and worn out, either by Old Age, or by great and continual errors in the Six non-naturals, eſpecially in Meat and Drink; or if the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Organs have been ſo debilitated, that they are wholly unable to purifie the Blood, and to carry off its Superfluities: In theſe caſes a greater ſtock of Humours being heap'd up than a Man's ſtrength is able to digeſt, the ſaid Humours by long continuance undergo various Fermentations and Putrefactions, and at length break out in ſpecie, and occaſion various kinds of Diſeaſes, according to the variety of Depravation; and as theſe deprav'd Juices have a various diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, ſo they variouſly fall upon this or that part which is fitteſt to receive them, and at length by degrees they ſhew their long train of Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, which are wont to ariſe partly from the nature of ſuch Juices, and partly from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion brought upon thoſe parts, which two join'd together, conſtitute the irregularity of Nature, which is mark'd with the name of ſome Diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>Now 'twill plainly appear, that ſuch an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency of Nature for the concocting the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, is the chief cauſe of Chronical Diſeaſes, if we conſider that Old Men whoſe Concoctions are weaken'd, and the Spirits the Inſtruments of them waſted by the repeated functions of a long
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:57356:63"/>
Life, are more ſubject to theſe Diſeaſes than Younger People, whoſe flame of Life being more kindled, ſcatters thoſe Feculencies heap'd up, and whoſe Secretory Organs are conſtantly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted by the natural heat, that they may not be deficient in purifying the Maſs of Blood, unleſs they are oppreſſed, and as it were ſuffoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by too great a quantity of Humours. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over that ſuch an indigeſtion of the Humours, is the cauſe of moſt Chronical Diſeaſes, is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt from hence, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe Winter is much more apt to breed ſuch Diſeaſes than Summer; though ſome of them don't actually break out till the latter end of Winter, yet the ſtock of Humours on which they depend, increaſing all the Winter, is inlarg'd by that cold and raw Seaſon, weakening Nature, ſo that ſhe is not ſo able to preſerve the oeconomy of the Body. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which account it happens, that they who are very well in Summer, ſeldom eſcape thoſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes in Winter whereunto they are moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd. For inſtance, the Gout or Aſthma, and a Cough, and the like. And from hence we may learn the reaſon why travelling into more Souther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Regions does ſo effectually vanquiſh thoſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes, the cure whereof is vainly attempted in colder Climates. The truth of what I have ſaid already concerning the general cauſe of Chronical Diſeaſes, will moreover manifeſt it ſelf by that great and incredible relief which thoſe that are afflicted with moſt Chronical Diſeaſes, eſpecially with a Phthiſis, receive by Riding on Horſe-back, which kind of Exerciſe invigorates and ſtrengthens all the Digeſtions, the natural
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:57356:64"/>
Heat being reviv'd by the continual ſhaking of the Body, and the Organs deſtin'd for Secretion, aſſiſted in duly performing their Office of purify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Blood, ſo that a Renovation of the ruin'd Digeſtions muſt neceſſarily follow, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, the beſt Conſtitution of Body.</p>
            <p>Wherefore 'tis manifeſt enough by the reaſons already alledg'd, that not only in the Gout, but alſo in other <hi>Chronical Diſeaſes,</hi> where no mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Symptom contraindicates; ſuch kind of hot Herbs are ſometimes very beneficial, for they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the heat of Summer, in the middle of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; tho' if we accuſtom our ſelves to the uſe of them in Summer-time, they will the better pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent thoſe Diſeaſes, which the contrary Seaſon is wont to occaſion: And truly if they are deferr'd till Winter approaches, at which time a great deal of Matter is heapt up, 'tis to be fear'd, we may fly too late to this Refuge. But tho' (as I have diſcours'd largely above) the Gout by a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Diſpoſition, is made worſe by Cathar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks; yet in moſt other <hi>Chronical Diſeaſes,</hi> Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing repeated as often as there is occaſion, and Purging is to be order'd, before theſe digeſtive and corroborating Medicines are to be us'd; but when the Patient has once enter'd upon the uſe of theſe, he muſt perſevere, without Purging be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt whiles; for this muſt be conſtantly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd, that as often as the Cure of any Diſeaſe is aſſay'd by corroborating Remedies, all Evacuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are wholly injurious. Laſtly, I don't affirm that theſe digeſtive Medicines now mention'd, are better than all others; but this I ſay, that he that can find out the beſt Remedy to anſwer this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:57356:64"/>
will do much more in curing <hi>Chronical Diſeaſes,</hi> than he wou'd imagine he was able to do.</p>
            <p>But this muſt be firſt taken notice of, and chiefly obſerv'd above all the things I am about to mention concerning the Cure of the Gout, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That all digeſtive Remedies whatſoever, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Courſes of Phyſick, or Diet, or Exerciſe, are not to be taken up by the by, but muſt be us'd conſtantly and daily with the greateſt Diligence; for whereas in this Diſeaſe, as alſo in moſt other Chronical Diſeaſes, the cauſe of it has paſs'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an Habit, and is become as it were a new Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: No Man in his right Senſes, can think that ſome ſmall and ſhort alteration, ſuperinduc'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Blood and Humours, by any ſort of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy or Diet, can perfect the Cure; for the whole Habit of the Body muſt be chang'd, and the whole Man muſt be as it were new fram'd; for 'tis not ſo here, as in ſome accute Diſeaſe, where he that even now was ſtrong, and perfectly well, is ſuddenly ſeiz'd with a Fever, and precipitated from the beſt ſtate of Health, into the moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Diſeaſe. No, the caſe of the Gout is quite different, where he that for many years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, by immoderately indulging himſelf in Surfeiting and Drunkenneſs, and neglecting his wonted Exerciſes, is worn out by Sloth and Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, or by hard Study, or continual and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe Thinking, or by ſome other Errors of Life; as if he had deſignedly perverted the various Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Body, and oppreſs'd the animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, (which are the chief Inſtruments of Digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) by which means the preternatural Humours
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:57356:65"/>
that were heapt up, break out at length, when they are arriv'd to the higheſt degree, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found all, the Fleſh being ſoften'd, and the Joynts weaken'd, ſo that they readily receive the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours falling upon them. And ſo at length ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nature is as it were, ſuperinduc'd by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, the priſtine and natural oeconomy of the Body being wholly ſubverted, and deſtroy'd: And thoſe Fits about which unwary and unthinking Men are ſo buſied, are indeed nothing elſe but the Series and order of Symptoms, depending on that method which Nature is wont to uſe in dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving out the Matter that occaſions the Diſeaſe; wherefore he labours in vain, that endeavours to drive away this Diſeaſe, by this or that Medicine or Regimen now and then us'd. For this Habit being chiefly founded, and conſiſting both in the weakneſs of all the Digeſtions, and in the want of the natural Strength of the particular Parts, we muſt provide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt both theſe Ills, and the ſtrength of Concocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as well as the Soundneſs of the Parts, muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d and reſtor'd by degrees to the former ſtate and accuſtom'd oeconomy of the Body, tho' to do this fully and perfectly, may not ſeem poſſible, not only becauſe any Habit is difficultly chang'd into the quite contrary, but alſo becauſe Old Age which moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly accompanies this Diſeaſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> violently oppoſes; yet the Cure is to be endeavour'd as much as the Strength and Years will permit: And the nearer or farther from this Mark the Patient is, he will more or leſs avoid the Tyranny of the Gout.</p>
            <p>And 'tis moreover to be noted, That digeſtive Remedies, either medicinal or dietetic, are chiefly to be us'd in the Intervals of the Fits, and as long as may be before the next Fit; for by reaſon of
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:57356:65"/>
Old Age, much time is requir'd, and a conſtant uſe of Remedies, before the corroboration of all the Concoctions and the Reſtauration of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feebl'd Ferments of the Body, and ſuch a Sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as is requiſite for the Blood and Viſcera can be obtain'd.</p>
            <p>But tho theſe Remedies and other things of the ſame kind, may do good, yet this intention of corroborating, can't be anſwer'd by theſe things alone, but reſpect muſt be alſo had to thoſe things which don't properly belong to Phyſick. And he will be moſt certainly deceiv'd that thinks he can perform the Cure of this, or ſome other Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Diſeaſe, by Medicines alone. Firſt therefore, a Mediocrity is to be obſerv'd in Meat and Drink, ſo that neither more Nouriſhment be taken in, than the Stomach can concoct, leſt the Diſeaſe ſhou'd be heigthen'd by it; nor on the contrary muſt the Parts, by too much Abſtinence, be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded of that Proportion, whereby their Strength and Vigor ought to be ſuſtain'd, for by ſo doing, they will be more weaken'd, for either is alike injurious, as I have often found in my ſelf and others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>: Moreover, as to the quality of the Meat, tho' things of eaſie Digeſtion conſider'd by themſelves, are to be prefer'd before things of hard Digeſtion; yet regard muſt be had to the Patients Palate: For we muſt take notice, That that which the Stomach earneſtly craves for, tho' of difficult Digeſtion, is ſooner conquer'd by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, than that which is accounted to be of eaſier Digeſtion, if it be offenſive to the Stomach; but thoſe things that are reckon'd of hard Digeſtion, are therefore to be eaten more ſparingly; and I
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:57356:66"/>
ſuppoſe the Patient ought to feed upon one ſort of Meat at a Meal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for various ſorts of Fleſh eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en at once, diſturb the Stomach, more than one ſort eaten in the ſame quantity. As to other things beſide Fleſh, let him eat at Pleaſure, if they are not Sharp, nor Salted, nor Spic'd; which tho' they don't hurt Concoction, yet are they injurious, for that they exagitate the Fomes of the Diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>As to the times of eating, a Dinner is only ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; for the Bed being moſt proper to digeſt the Humours, that time ought not to be waſted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout concocting the Meat; therefore they that are ſubject to the Gout, ſhou'd not eat Suppers, yet they may allow themſelves a large Draught of ſmall Beer, for ſuch are alſo moſt commonly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable to breed the Stone in the Kidnies, the Concretion whereof, is much hinder'd by ſuch a kind of Liquor, drank at this time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Reins be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cool'd and cleans'd thereby.</p>
            <p>The drinking of Milk, or a Milk Diet, either crude or boyl'd, without any thing elſe, except perhaps a piece of Bread with it once a day, has been much us'd theſe Twenty years, and it has done more good to many, than any other ſort of Remedy for this Diſeaſe, as long as they kept to it: But as ſoon as they return'd to common Diet, tho' of eaſie Digeſtion, the Gout return'd more violently than before, and held them longer; for the Principles of Nature being weaken'd by this method, the Sick was render'd leſs capable to repell the Diſeaſe, upon which account 'twas more dangerous and laſted longer. Therefore he that intends to betake himſelf to this method, ought
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:57356:66"/>
firſt to conſider ſeriouſly whether he can perſiſt in the uſe of it all his Life long, which perhaps is not in his Power, how reſolv'd ſo ever he may be. For I knew a Noble Man, who after he had been dieted with Milk only, a whole year with Pleaſure, (all which time, he went to Stool daily once or oftner) was forc'd to leave it off, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he was ſuddenly bound in Body, and the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of his Body alter'd, and becauſe his Stomach at length nauſeated Milk, tho' the inclination of his Mind ſtill continued. But ſome hypochondri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acal People of a groſs habit of Body, or who o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe have accuſtom'd themſelves much and a long while to ſpirituous Liquor, can by no means bear a Milk Diet. Moreover, that very ſhort and fading Benefit that they receive by this Diet, to whom Milk is agreeable, proceeds hence, <hi>viz.</hi> not only for that this Diet is moſt ſimple, (for I don't doubt but that Barly-Broath, if the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach will bear it, may do as well) but alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it renders the Blood more mild and ſweet by quelling the Acrid Particles in it; and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, which I ſuppoſe is moſt conſiderable, Milk being a ſort of aliment very unfit for grown Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſuppreſſes that Turgeſcency of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, which occaſions the Gout; and for that reaſon thoſe few with whom a Milk Diet agrees, are ſo long free from the Gout as they feed upon it, and no longer; for by being wholly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the original cauſe of the Gout, <hi>viz.</hi> the weakneſs of the Ferments and Concoctions, 'tis much more injurious than beneficial. And becauſe this has not been ſufficiently regarded, ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary People have fell into great and fatal Errors;
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:57356:67"/>
for by endeavouring to oppoſe the containing cauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the heat and ſharpneſs of the Humours, they have deſtroy'd the concoctions and all the natural Functions.</p>
            <p>As to Liquors, thoſe in my opinion are beſt, that are neither as ſtrong as Wine, nor as weak as water, of which ſort is our <hi>London</hi> Small-Beer, with or without Hops; for extreames on either hand are hurtful. Firſt as to Wine, tho' the Proverb ſays, Drink Wine and have the Gout, and drink no Wine and have the Gout: Yet 'tis without Controveſie, and confirm'd by various Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments of gouty People, that Wine <hi>de facto</hi> is injurious. For tho' it may be ſuppos'd to do good by helping the Concoctions, the Diſorders whereof, I have long accounted the antecedent cauſe of the Gout; yet with reſpect to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining cauſe, it mſt be reckon'd wholly injurious, for that it fires and exagitates the Humours, the Fomes of the Diſeaſe, already prepar'd to give Battel: Yet I don't grant that Wine us'd for or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary drink, does promote Concoction, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpoyls it, unleſs in thoſe that have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtom'd to Wine a long while; for tho' as it paſſes by it imparts ſome Heat, yet it certainly injures the Ferments of the Body, and deſtroys the natural Spirits; and for this reaſon I ſuppoſe, great Drinkers dye of the Gout, Dropſie, Palſie and other cold Diſeaſes. Moreover, a continual and immoderate ſwilling of Wine, renders the Body ſoft like Womens Bodies, whereas tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Liquors ſtrengthen and confirm the Tone of all the Parts; for which reaſon, they that have always us'd ſmall Liquors, ſeldom know what the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:57356:67"/>
Gout means. 'Tis moreover to be noted, That thoſe Men are moſt inclinable to this Diſeaſe, who tho' their natural Concoction is leſſen'd, are nouriſh'd more than enough by reaſon of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Luxury of the Blood, and they grow bulky by ſome indigeſted Matter, inſtead of good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and well compacted. And drinking of Wine does more increaſe this Luxury of the Blood; and moreover, heaps up a new Stock of Matter, and actually occaſions the Diſeaſe, by firing as it were the Fomes of it, which has been laid up a long while. And beſides, the Blood of gouty People, being very like that which is taken from thoſe that have a Pleuriſie, or ſome other inflamatory Diſeaſe; 'twould be a mad thing to inrage it more with ſpirituous Liquors. Nor on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, are Liquors too much cooling to be us'd; for theſe by quite ſpoyling the Concoctions, and by extinguiſhing the natural Heat, occaſion the greater Miſchief; not Pain as Wine does, but Death it ſelf: As Experience teaches in thoſe who freely indulging themſelves in drinking Wine, till they are Old, and betaking themſelves ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly to drink Water or ſmall Liquors, have ſoon deſtroy'd themſelves.</p>
            <p>Therefore thoſe that are ſubject to the Gout, muſt take care that they uſe thoſe Liquors, that can neither cauſe Drunkenneſs when they are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in a large quantity, nor yet injure the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach by chilling it; of this kind as I ſaid, is our Small-Beer, and a proper Liquor may be made in other Countries, by mixing a little Water with a great deal of Wine. I count Water by it ſelf, crude and injurious, and I have found it ſo to my
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:57356:68"/>
hurt. But Water may be ſafely drunk by young People, wherewith at this day, the greateſt part of Mankind quenches Thirſt, being more happy with their Poverty, than we with Plenty and Luxury. To confirm which, I produce that great Train of Diſeaſes, whereby our Bodies on this accout are tortur'd, <hi>viz.</hi> the Gout, Stone, Apoplexy, Palſie and the like; and that Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence upon the Mind, whereby 'tis driven con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to its native Rectitude, while the adventiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Spirits of ſuch Liquors, complicated with the animal Spirits, ſerving for the forming Thoughts, diſturb the Mind, by volatiliſing it too much, ſuggeſting vain and frivolous Fancies, inſtead of things that are ſolid and of ſome moment; and ſo makes us Jeſters and merry Fellows, inſtead of Wiſe Men, between which, the difference is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the ſame, as betwixt a Subſtance and a Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow: But enough of this.</p>
            <p>But now, tho' it may be ſufficient for him that has the Gout but a little, and at ſome times only, to uſe Small-beer and diluted Wine, the degree of his Diſeaſe not requiring a more ſever uſage; yet when the whole Subſtance of the Body is as it were, degenerated into the Gout, he will be leſs able to conquer the Diſeaſe, who does not wholly abſtain from any ſort of fermented Liquors, tho' Small and Mild; for all theſe contain a pungent Spirit, and ſome degree of Sharpneſs, and what is worſe, as they have a Ferment in them, (even as Yeaſt put into Liquors, imparts a fermentative Vertue to the whole Maſs) ſo they incline the Humours to a perpetual Fermentation. Therefore a Die<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tetick Drink muſt be preſcrib'd of the Ingredients
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:57356:68"/>
commonly known and appointed for this uſe, for ordinary Drink, if it be not too ſtrong, for if ſo, the Humours will be almoſt as much inrag'd as by Wine: And on the contrary, it muſt not be ſo ſmall, as to injure the natural Functions, by over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cooling them. This ſort of Drink if it be made of ſuch Ingredients as are leaſt diſpleaſing to the Sick, tho' the conſtant taking them, may cauſe ſome loathing for a Week or too, will afterwards be as pleaſing and as acceptable, as any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Liquors to which he has been moſt accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom'd. And by this kind of Liquor, the Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite will be increas'd, and become more natural than it us'd to be with fermented Liquors. And moreover, there will be this advantage, that he that uſes this dietetick Liquor for his ordinary Drink, may the freer indulge himſelf in other Diet, than when he drank Beer or Wine, for the Errors in Diet (all which 'tis almoſt impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for a Man to avoid) will by this means, be ſomewhat corrected and amended. But which is the chiefeſt of all, the Sick may prevent the Stone by this means, which is uſually the conſtant com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion of the Gout; for all ſharp and attenuating Liquors, occaſion a Fit of the Stone, as well as generate it. The following Liquor being of a pleaſant Taſte and Colour, pleaſes me beſt.</p>
            <p>Take of Sarsaparilla ℥vi, of Saſſaphras, China, and the Shavings of Harts-horn, each ℥ij, of Liquo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh ℥i; boyl them in Two Gallons of Fountain Water for half an hour, afterwards let them ſtand cover'd upon hot Aſhes <hi>12</hi> hours, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards boyl it to the conſumption of a Third part; as ſoon as 'tis taken from the Fire, infuſe
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:57356:69"/>
half an Ounce of Anniſeeds, after 2 hours strain it, and let it ſtand till it's clear; keep the clear Liquor in Glaſs Bottles well ſtopt for uſe.</p>
            <p>This Liquor is moſt conveniently us'd at firſt, when the Patient recovers of the Fit, and he muſt perſevere in the uſe of it all the reſt of his Life as well when he has the Fits, as at other times. At the ſame time the foreſaid Electuary muſt be us'd daily, as well in the Fits, as when they are off; the Heat of this will ſomewhat allay the Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhneſs of the dietetick Drink, affording a due de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of heat to the Blood and Bowels, without that agitation which us'd to be occaſion'd by the heat of fermented Liquors.</p>
            <p>If any one ſhou'd object that that Life is ſcarce vital, wherein a total Abſtinence from Wine and other fermented Liquors is obſerv'd: I anſwer, it muſt be conſider'd whether it be not much more miſerable and leſs tolerable, to be rack'd and dreadfully tortur'd by the Gout, grown ſtrong by continuance, (for when the Diſeaſe is gentle, this is not requiſite) than to be confin'd to this Liquor; the uſe of which being continued, he may indulge himſelf in almoſt all ſorts of Food: Not to repeat now that this Drink (as all other things) grows pleaſant by cuſtom. Certainly he that has felt this Diſeaſe, if he be a Man, will not long diſpute which is beſt.</p>
            <p>Yet notwithſtanding, if the Sick by reaſon of a long and too great uſe of intoxicating Liquors, or by reaſon of Old Age or Weakneſs, can't concoct his Meat without Wine or ſome other fermented Liquor, he can't leave it off ſuddenly without great danger, the doing whereof has been fatal
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:57356:69"/>
to many. Therefore in my opinion, he ſhou'd not uſe the dietetick Apozem above deſcrib'd; but if he be reſolv'd to uſe it, let him be accuſtom'd to it leiſurely, (drinking a Draught of Wine at Meals for ſome time) more like a Remedy than a Diet, till the Decoction becomes more familiar: But Spaniſh Wine is to be preferr'd in this caſe before French or Rhe<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ſh Wine, the two laſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing apt to inrage the Humours, and to increaſe the Fomes of the Diſeaſe, tho' they are very grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the Stomach. Moreover, they are almoſt as crude, and ſcarce more concocted than our Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and beſides they are not ſo cordial and hot, as the caſe requires. And ſo much may ſuffice for the Meat and Drink of gouty People.</p>
            <p>There's another thing which tho' it may ſeem ſmall, yet is it of great moment, as well for digeſting the Fomes of the Diſeaſe, when the Fit is violent, as for hindering the generation of the Matter, when the Fit is off; namely, that the Sick, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in Winter, go to Bed early; for beſides, Bleeding and Purging, nothing does ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the ſtrength of Nature, as watching a Nights, which every ſickly perſon can affirm by Experience, if he conſiders how much brisker and more chearful he riſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when he goes to Bed early, and how languid and faint he is when has ſat up late; and tho' it may ſeem as well, if he lyes a Bed ſo many hours, whether he goes to Bed ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or later: For inſtance, whether he goes to Bed at Nine, and riſes at Five, or goes to Bed at Eleven, and riſes at Seven; yet 'tis not ſo, and I ſuppoſe chiefly for this reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time the Spirits are diſſipated, either by the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:57356:70"/>
of the Body or Mind, which in People that are ſickly, are ſo infirm and weak, that they have need of Reſt earlier in the Evening; for the approach of Night occaſioning as it were, a kind of Relaxation of the Economy of the Body, which was kept up in the Day-time, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the Sun; 'tis neceſſary that the heat of the Bed ſhou'd ſupply the want of the Sun, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in Winter. But in the Morning, the Spirits being refreſh'd and invigorated by the reſt of the foregoing Night, and the warmth of the Bed, (beſides, for that the ſupervening day adds Firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Strength to the Tone of the Body) riſing early at this time, tho' an hour or two is taken from the Morning Sleep, Nature is not ſo much injur'd as by Evening Watchings protracted an hour or two. Wherefore I wou'd perſwade thoſe that are ſubject to the Gout, to go to Bed early; eſpecially in the Winter, and to riſe early, tho' Sleep ſomewhat ſhorter, may intice them to lye longer; for ſleeping in a Morning, prevents ſo much Sleep the next Night, and ſo at length, a force being brought upon Nature, and its wiſe Inſtitutions deſpis'd, Night is turn'd into Day, and Day into Night.</p>
            <p>Moreover, Tranquility of Mind, muſt by all means be obtain'd; for all Perturbations, when they break the Bounds, mightly diſſolve the frame of the Spirits, that are the Inſtruments of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions; and ſo by conſequence, much promote the Gout. Therefore the Sick ſhou'd prudently conſider his own mortal Condition, and not fooliſhly imagine that he is freed from thoſe Troubles, that neceſſarily follow it; for whether
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:57356:70"/>
he ſuffers this Affliction of Mind, either by his own Fault, or Fault of others, he can never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe Laws to the World, who has not been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways obedient to any one, how Potent and Wiſe ſoever he has been; nor does ever all things fall out ſo exactly, according to any ones Mind, as he fondly imagines, but ſuddenly as he is buſied in Mind about the ordering of things, he becomes the Specimen of humane Frailty, having unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably depriv'd himſelf of the Enjoyment, of the fading Fruits of Life. The ſame Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, follows too great an Application of Mind to Study and ſerious things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for Melancholy always accompanying this Diſeaſe more than any other, thoſe that are ſubject to it, are wont to tire and overwhelm the Animal Spirits, by think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much and long, without the artificial help of Books; and they do ſo mightly overthink, that the oeconomy of the Body, can't any longer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it ſelf whole: For which reaſon in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, this Diſeaſe ſeizes (except my ſelf if you pleaſe) very few Fools.</p>
            <p>But the Exerciſe of the Body is more profitable, than all other things that are us'd to hinder the Indigeſtion of the Humours, (which I reckon the chief cauſe of the Gout) and to corroborate the Blood, and to reſtore ſtrength to the Parts: But it muſt be noted, which I have mention'd above, that as in this Diſeaſe, more than in any other Chronical Diſeaſe, the Habit of the whole Body ought to be chang'd,; the Exerciſe of the Body, unleſs 'tis daily, will do no good; for this kind of Exerciſe intermitted by turns, as it does ſcarce conduce any thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the change of the Habit of
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:57356:71"/>
the Body grown Languid and Eſſeminate, by Sloth and Indulgence, ſo perhaps it may prove injurious, by occaſioning the Fit when the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient has diſus'd it a long while. But this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe ought not to be violent, but ſuch as is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to Old Men, which are moſt uſually the ſubjects of the Gout. For too violent a motion of the Body does too much diſſipate the Spirits, and by conſequence hurts the Concotions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as conſtant and moderate Exerciſe ſtrengthens them. Though this may ſeem hard to a Man, who beſides Old Age and Sloth, and the unfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Body for motion, which is as it were natural in this Diſeaſe, is moreover puniſh'd with Pain; and yet if this be omitted, nothing which has been already found out will do any good. And as the Intervals of the Fits without conſtant Exerciſe of the Body can't be long, ſo ſuch a one will be more prone to breed the Stone, which is more dangerous and more tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting than the Gout.</p>
            <p>Moreover (which is of great moment) the Stony Matter is much increas'd by long reſt in the Joints of the Body, eſpecially of the Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, ſo that at length they are wholly depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of all motion. For how confidently ſoever ſome People affirm, that the Matter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of theſe Stones is nothing elſe but the Tartar of the Blood put off upon the Joints, yet 'twill eaſily appear to any one that does a little weigh the thing more ſeriouſly, that when a great deal of unconcocted Matter cauſing the Gout, flows up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome of the Joints, and renders the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring parts tumid a long while, at laſt it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:57356:71"/>
that partly by reaſon the aſſimulative ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of theſe is choak'd, and partly by reaſon of a ſuffocating obſtruction which this dull Humour breeds in them, the ſaid Matter is generated, which is turn'd into this kind of Subſtance by the heat and pain of the Joints, and is daily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd, changing the Fleſh and Skin into its own nature, which now lies naked, and may be pick'd out with a Needle, and is like Chalk, or Crabs Eyes, or ſome ſuch thing. But now this ill may be prevented by daily exerciſe, by which the Humours cauſing the Gout, which are apt to ſeize on one part, are duly ſcatter'd through the whole Body. So that it come to paſs as I have obſerv'd in my ſelf, that long and daily exerciſe does not only hinder the generation of this Stony Matter, but alſo diſſolves the Stones when they are hard and old, if they have not prevail'd ſo far, as to change the outward Skin into their own Subſtance.</p>
            <p>As to the kind of Exerciſe, riding on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, when Old Age or the Stone does not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, is much to be preferr'd before the reſt: And truly I have many times thought with my ſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that if any one knew a Medicine which he cou'd alſo conceal, as effectual in this and moſt other Chronical Diſeaſes, as conſtant and daily riding on Horſe-back, he might eaſily get a vaſt Eſtate. If this can't be us'd, riding in a Coach does almoſt as well; and on this account at leaſt 'tis well with Gouty People, for their Riches which enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them to Luxury<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereby the Diſeaſe was bred, can provide them a Coach, which kind of
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:57356:72"/>
Exerciſe they may uſe, when they can't the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>But 'tis to be obſerv'd, that 'tis beſt to uſe Exerciſe in a good Air, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Country, and not in a City, where the Air is fill'd with Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours exhaling from the Shops of various Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, and thicken'd by the cloſeneſs of the Buildings, as 'tis here in <hi>London,</hi> which is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſuppos'd to be the moſt ſpacious City in the whole World. But how great the difference is betwixt Exerciſing in the Country, and Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe in Town, any one that has the Gout will ſoon find.</p>
            <p>As to Venery, he that is Old and Gouty (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now deſtitute of a ſtock of Spirits, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Concoctions ought to be promoted, and by conſequence his Joints and the neighbouring parts to them are but too much weaken'd and looſen'd without this adventitious deſtruction,) is equally as improvident in my opinion, if he indulge himſelf in theſe allurements, as he that having undertaken a long Journey, ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume all his Proviſions before he ſets out; for beſides the Miſchief he brings upon himſelf by not reſtraining the impotent deſires of fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Age, he deprives himſelf of the great privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of injoying that Jubile which is reſerv'd as the great and ſpecial favour of Nature for Old Men only, whereby in the laſt Scene of their Lives, they are at length emancipated from the impetuoſities of Luſt, which like a rave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Beaſt worried them all the time of their Youth Night and Day: For the full ſatisfaction of theſe Appetites, can no way compenſate for
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:57356:72"/>
that long train of Miſeries that either accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany or follow it. And ſo much for the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
            <p>But though Rules of this kind reſpecting Diet and the other Regimen, if they are carefully ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd by thoſe that are ſubject to the Gout, may preſerve them from violent Fits of it, and may reſtore that ſtrength to the Blood and Solid parts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereby they may be freed from the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Miſeries, on which account this Diſeaſe exceeds Humane Patience, and at length becomes Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal; yet after ſome intervals, eſpecially at the latter end of Winter, they will be ſometimes ſeiz'd with the Gout<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for though in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer-time, when the tone and vigour of the Blood is excited and preſerv'd in its ſtate by the heat of the Sun, and there is likewiſe a due Elimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Humours through the Pores, 'tis reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that the Concoctions ſhould proceed much better than in the Winter; yet when Winter approaches, the ſtrength of the Blood being leſſen'd, and the perſpiration through the Pores hinder'd, there muſt needs be a great heap of indigeſted Matter, which by its long continuance cauſes a Fit, as ſoon as occaſion is offer'd, either by the Humours put into Motion by the Patients ſo near approach to the Sun, or by drinking of Wine, or by violent Exerciſe, or any other evident cauſe.</p>
            <p>'Tis manifeſt from what has been ſaid, that he that endeavours to cure this Diſeaſe, ought to make it his buſineſs to change the habit of his whole Body, and to reſtore its old Conſtitution, as much as Age and other Circumſtances will
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:57356:73"/>
permit, which muſt be endeavour'd in the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces betwixt the Fits; not when the Fits are on, for when the Fomes is not only generated, but now is caſt upon the Joint, 'tis too late to ſtrive to change it, or to caſt it out any other way, for 'tis to be ejected by no other method than Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhews, wherein alone we muſt acquieſce; which is obſerv'd in the Fits of Agues, and for which-reaſon we do nothing till the heat is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: Nor is he more abſurd, that is anxiouſly buſied about taking off the heat, drouth and reſtlefneſs, and other Symptoms of theſe Fevers, than he that thinks he has cur'd the Gout, when he has only labour'd to reſtrain the Symptoms; for by this means he has only made the cure of it more difficult; for the more he eaſes the Pain, the more he obſtructs the Concoction of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and the more he takes off the Lameneſs, the more he hinders the expulſion of the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bifick Matter. Moreover the more the fury and the ſharpneſs of the Fit is ſuppreſs'd, 'twill not only laſt longer, but the ſpace betwixt the Fits will alſo be ſhorter, and leſs free from every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of the Symptoms which accompany this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe; which no one will deny that has well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd what I have treated of above concerning the Hiſtory of this Diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>But now though no great Matter muſt be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted during the Fit, only the removing thoſe Symptoms, which a falſe method of cure ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times occaſions, yet ſeeing all allow that this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe proceeds from an abundance and an exu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berancy of Humours, it may perhaps be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for the Patient to abſtain from Fleſh for
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:57356:73"/>
ſome Days when he's firſt ſeiz'd, and inſtead of it, to uſe Simple Barly Broth, or ſome ſuch kind of Food, which ſort of thin Diet conduces much towards the leſſening the Morbifick Matter, and will give Nature an opportunity to digeſt it ſooner. But foraſmuch as there's a vaſt difference betwixt the Body of one Perſon and another, ſome not bearing abſtinence from Fleſh, but by reaſon of it are ſeiz'd with a confuſion of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal Spirits, with Fainting, and other Symptoms which are wont to befal Women that are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Hyſterical Fits, theſe People are injur'd if they forbear Fleſh any longer than their Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs loath it, which ſeldom laſts beyond the firſt or ſecond day of the particular Fits, all which join'd together as I mention'd above, make a whole Fit; but whether any one eat Fleſh ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or later, great care muſt be taken, that they eat no more during the Fit than is neceſſary to ſuſtain Nature. Nor is leſs care to be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the quality of the Diet; for as in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals of the Fits, ſo more eſpecially when the Fit is preſent, the Sick ought to take the greateſt care, that he don't at all err in the quality or quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Meat or Drink. And moreover, more than ordinary care muſt be taken in obſerving every other Regimen, as well as this in the intervals; and though the pain as well as the unfitneſs for motion, may ſeem to contraindicate Exerciſe which I have commended above all others things, yet this labour muſt be undertaken. For though at the beginning of the Fit it may ſeem impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that the Sick ſhould bear to be carried into a Coach, and to be ſure he's much leſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:57356:74"/>
to bear the motion of it, and yet if he try it, he will ſoon perceive that he's leſs pain'd by ſuch a motion, than when he keeps at Home in his Chair. And moreover he has this advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, if he ride ſome Hours in his Coach, in the Morning, and after Dinner, that whereas when he ſat at Home all day, he lay awak'd the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of the Night, now he can ſleep away the pain a great part of the Night; for very moderate Exerciſe does ſo weary a Gouty Man, that he falls aſleep: And beſides the ſame Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe does ſomewhat prevent the Stone, which an eaſie Life moſt commonly occaſions. But what is moſt conſiderable, the total impotence of the Limbs for motion, is help'd by conſtant Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, which happens to many after the Firſt or Second Fit, the Tendons of the Hams and Heels being contracted; for when by reaſon of the tormenting Pain they have allow'd themſelves to lye ſtill a long time (being unwilling to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend their Legs when the Pain has ſeiz'd their Knees,) at length they are depriv'd of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Legs and Feet all the reſt of their Lives, as well when the Fits are off, as when they are on, for they are not freed from them. Furthermore in Old Men, whoſe Concoctions are much vitiated, and who by reaſon the Diſeaſe has afflicted them many Years, have as it were the very ſubſtance of their Bodies turn'd to the Gout, 'tis not to be hop'd that the Diſeaſe without Exerciſe, can ever be brought to Dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion; for when the Diſeaſe is too ſtrong for Nature, they often dye by Fainting and Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which the abundance of the furniture for
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:57356:74"/>
the Diſeaſe that can't be concocted produces, and they are deſtroy'd by this matter, that can't be concocted as by Poyſon.</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding what has been ſaid of the Utility of Exerciſe in the Fits of the Gout, yet if the Sick by reaſon of the violence of the Fit, is as it were overwhelm'd preſently by the firſt aſſault of it, (which happens to thoſe for the moſt part in whom the Gout has now come to its height, nor is yet grown gentle by a courſe of many Years,) in this caſe if the Sick is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd to his Chamber, 'twill alſo be convenient that he keep his Bed for ſome of the firſt Days, 'till the violence of the Pain is abated, for the Bed does ſomewhat ſupply the want of Exerciſe, for the continual uſe of it does more powerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly digeſt the Morbifick Matter in a few Days, than keeping up in many, eſpecially at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Diſeaſe, if the Sick can abſtain from Fleſh without Fainting or other ill Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, and can be contented only with Barly Broth, Small Beer, and the like. But we muſt take notice that if the Gout is inveterate, and inclines the Sick to Fainting, Gripes, a Looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſuch kind of Symptoms, he will ſcarce avoid being deſtroy'd by one of the Fits, if he don't uſe Exerciſe in a free and open Air: For a great many Gouty People have periſh'd by theſe Symptoms, to whom they have been obnoxious by being confin'd to their Chambers, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to their Beds; whereas had they bore the fategue of riding in a Coach the greateſt part of the Day, they had not died ſo ſoon. For though he that is troubled with Pain only in
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:57356:75"/>
one of his Limbs, may confine himſelf to his Chamber, yet another that inſtead of violent Pain is afflicted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with Sickneſs, and the other foreſaid Symptoms, ſhould he do the ſame, wou'd endanger his Life; and indeed 'tis well for the Sick when the pain is ſo violent, that he can't bear motion, for then there's no great need of it, the very pain which is the bittereſt Remedy in nature, ſecuring his Life.</p>
            <p>But as to the Symptoms of the Gout, we muſt apply our ſelves to thoſe whereby the Life of the Patient is indanger'd; the debility and faintneſs of the Stomach, with Gripes of the Belly as from Wine, is the moſt frequent of theſe which befalls thoſe who either have been ſubject to the Gout many Years, or thoſe who though they have not been long afflicted with it, have not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding invited this miſchief too early, by ſuddenly changing Spirituous Liquors for thoſe that are thin and much cooling, or by applying repelling Plaſters, and other cooling Medicines to the Parts affected, to aſſwage the Pain; upon which account the material cauſe of the Diſeaſe which ought to have been put off upon the Joints, is caſt upon the Bowels. I have tried many things for the Fits of the laſt Years to leſſen this Symptom; but nothing did ſo much good as a ſmall Draught of Canary Wine taken now and then, when the Sickneſs and Faintneſs afflicts the Sick: Nor is Red French Wine, nor Venice Treacle, nor any other Cordial thing which I have yet known, ſo effectual. But we muſt i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine that neither this Wine, nor any other
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:57356:75"/>
Cordial if Exerciſe be not us'd, can wholly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Patient.</p>
            <p>But if any great Symptom ſcarce bearing a Truce comes ſuddenly by reaſon of the ſtriking in of the Gouty Matter, and threatens Death, we muſt neither truſt to the Wine, nor to the Exerciſe above commended; but in this caſe, if it does not fall upon the Head, but upon the Natural or Vital Parts, we muſt preſently fly to Laudanum, namely, give Twenty Drops of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid Laudanum, mix'd with a ſmall Draught of Epidemick Water, and let the Patient compoſe himſelf to reſt in his Bed. But if the Matter occaſioning the Gout produces a Diarrhaea, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 'tis not yet caſt upon the Limbs, if it be not the Criſis of a particular Fit, and if notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding Laudanum above commended, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of all ſorts, (for this muſt be firſt uſed for the Cure of the Diarrhaea,) the Looſeneſs continues, accompanied with Sickneſs and Gripes, there's only one Remedy that I know of, <hi>viz.</hi> to provoke Sweat, by a Method and Medicines de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd for this uſe, which if it be done Two or Three Days, Morning and Evening, for Two or Three Hours at a time, it moſt commonly ſtops the Looſeneſs, and forces the Fomes of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe upon the Limbs. I cur'd my ſelf by this Method ſome Years ago, after I had imprudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly caſt my ſelf into this Diſeaſe by Drinking Water for my ordinary Drink, when I had us'd Cardiack and Aſtringent Medicines of various ſorts in vain.</p>
            <p>There is another Symptom not ſo frequent, though I have ſeen it divers times, <hi>viz.</hi> a tranſlation
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:57356:76"/>
of the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eccant Matter upon the Lobes of the Lungs, when a Winter Cough by reaſon of Cold taken in the time of the Fit, has by degrees drawn the Matter upon the Lungs, the Limbs in the mean while being wholly or almoſt freed from the Pain and Swelling, by reaſon of the tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Morbifick Matter upon another re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; in this one caſe the curative indication is not to be directed to the Gout, but this Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom is to be treated as a true Peripneumonia, <hi>viz.</hi> by Bleeding repeated, and Cooling and Thickening Remedies and Diet; for the Blood drawn in this Symptom eſpecially, is exactly like the Blood of Pleuriticks. Moreover the Sick muſt be Purged betwixt the Bleedings, whereby the Filth that's fallen upon the Lungs may be carried off. But Sweating how powerful ſoever 'tis in forcing the Fomes of the Diſeaſe upon the Limbs, does hurt in this caſe, by hardening the Matter that's thruſt upon the Lungs; upon which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count ſmall abſceſſes are generated, and at length the Sick certainly dies.</p>
            <p>Moreover 'tis to be noted, that almoſt all Gouty People, when they have conflicted a long while with this Diſeaſe, are ſubject to the Stone of the Kidnies; and that they are wont to be troubled with Nephretick Pains, either in the ſtate, but moſt commonly at the declination of a general Fit, which don't only torture him much, but alſo weakens him much, whereas he was but too much weaken'd and worn out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. In this caſe, ſetting aſide all other Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, let him preſently take a Gallon of Poſſet-Drink, wherein ℥ij of the Roots of Marſh Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:57356:76"/>
has been boyl'd, and let the following Clyſter be injected.</p>
            <p>Take of the Roots of Marſh-Mallows, and Lillies, each ℥i, of the Leaves of Mallows, Pellitory of the Wall, Bears Breach, and of the Flowers of Chamomel, each <hi>M</hi> i, of Flax and Fennu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greek Seeds, each ℥ſs, boil them in a S. Q. of Water to <abbr>lb</abbr>iſs, diſſolve in the ſtraining of Brown Sugar and Syrup of Marſh-Mallows, each ℥ij, mingle them, and make a Clyſter. As ſoon as he has render'd all the Poſſet-Drink by Vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and has rejected the Clyſter, let him take a large Doſe of Liquid Laudanum, <hi>viz.</hi> to xxv Drops, or xv Grains of Mathew's Pill.</p>
            <p>If any one inquires for External Remedies to eaſe the Pain of the Gout, I have hitherto known none, (though I have tried many in my ſelf and others,) excepting things meerly cooling and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling, the uſe whereof I have ſhew'd above is dangerous. And I conſidently affirm, that the greateſt part of thoſe who have periſhed in the Gout, have not ſo properly been kill'd by the Diſeaſe, as by an improper uſe of Medicines. But if any one will try the vertue of External Remedies, which are certainly accounted Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines, don't let him impoſe upon himſelf, by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying them at the declination of a particular Fit, at which time the Pain is about to ceaſe of it ſelf; but rather let him uſe them at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of a Fit, and then he will ſoon perceive how fruitleſs they are, and how vain his hopes. For indeed theſe Epithems may do hurt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, but they can never do any good. For which reaſon I have us'd no External Remedies many
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:57356:77"/>
Years. The Pultis made with White Bread and Saffron boil'd in Milk, adding Oyl of Roſes in ſmall quantity, did heretofore do me more good than other things, and yet this ſignified nothing at the beginning of the Fit. Therefore if the pain be very violent, 'twill be better for the Sick to keep himſelf a Bed, 'till the Pain is a little abated, than to uſe external Anodines. But 'twill not be amiſs to take a little Laudanum in the Evening, if the Pain is intollerable, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe 'twill be better to omit it.</p>
            <p>But ſeeing I am now ſpeaking of External Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, I muſt ſay ſomething of the Indian Moſs, call'd <hi>Moxa,</hi> greatly eſteem'd of late for the cure of the Gout, if it be burnt a little upon the part affected. Though this kind of Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is ſaid to be receiv'd from the Oriental <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> being wholly unknown by the <hi>Europeans<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> yet 'twill appear to be known among us many Ages, to him that ſhall conſult the Writings of <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates,</hi> publiſhed above Two Thouſand Years ago. He ſays in his Excellent Treatiſe of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes, <hi>That if the Pain continues obſtiuate in any one part, and can't be expell'd by Medicines, in what ever part it is, you muſt burn it with crude Flax.</hi> And afterwards ſpeaking of the Gout, he ſays, <hi>the ſame things are good, which are proper in the Diſeaſes of the Joints; and indeed this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe is long and grievous, but not deadly. But if the Pain remains in the Fingers, burn the Veins in the Fingers, above the Joints, with crude Flax.</hi> Now I ſuppoſe no one will think that there's any Specifick difference betwixt the Flame rais'd by Flax, or by this Indian Moſs, no more than
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:57356:77"/>
he can ſuppoſe that a Fire kindled with pieces of Oak, can do any thing more than the Wood of the Aſh-Tree. This Burning of the part af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected may be uſeful for mitigating the Pain, the moſt Spirituous part of the Morbifick Matter caſt off upon the Joints, being drawn out by it; but the benefit obtain'd by this means, foraſmuch as it does not any way cure Indigeſtion, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent cauſe of the Gout muſt needs be very ſhort and fading, and to be uſed only when the Gout is beginning. For when the Gout, as it ſometimes happens, is turn'd inward, either by its long Continuance, or by an unſeaſonable and undue uſe of Medicines, and ſo afflicts the Patient rather with Sickneſs, Gripes, and a great many other Symptoms of this kind than with Pain, I ſuppoſe no one will think that Fire is to be uſed.</p>

            <head>CHAP. V. Of the Bloody Urine from the Stone in the Kidnies.</head>
            <p>THough it may ſeem imprudent to publiſh an Obſervation, whereof I have had only experience in my ſelf, yet I ſuppoſe no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudic'd Perſon will be angry with me, who have been ſo much and ſo long troubled with a Bloody Urine, occaſion'd by the Stone in the Kidnies, for commiſerating thoſe that are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with the ſame Diſeaſe, and for diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe Remedies that have eas'd me; though they are vulgar perhaps, and lightly account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1660, the Gout ſeiz'd me more violently, and continued longer than ever; and when on this account I lay'd continually for Two Months in the Summer-time, either in or upon a ſoft Bed; towards the latter end of the Fit I began to feel a dull and heavy pain, eſpecially in my left Kidney, and ſometimes, though rarely, in my right. And when I recover'd from the Gout, yet notwithſtanding the Pain of the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies remain'd, which made me fear the Stone, though the Pain was not at all Acute, but tollerable enough; for I had not yet had a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phretick Fit, which is accompanied with violent Pain, ſtretching it ſelf through the Paſſage of the Ureters, and with violent Vomiting. But though
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:57356:78"/>
theſe ſigns of the Stone in the Kidnies did not appear, yet I had good reaſon to believe, that I had a large Stone in the Pelvis of the Kidnies, which becauſe 'twas too large to paſs into the Paſſage of the Ureters, did not occaſion the foreſaid Symptoms. And many Years after I found I was not miſtaken; for when in the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, 1676, preſently after the breaking of a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Froſt, I had walk'd much and a long time, I immediately render'd Urine mix'd with Blood, and ſo I did as often as I walk'd much, or rode in a Coach in Pav'd Streets, though the Horſes went gently; but this did not happen to me, how far ſo ever I travell'd in the great Roads that are not pav'd The Urine that I void<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed then, though it look'd terrible as I render'd it, almoſt like pure Blood, yet ſoon after 'twas limpid and like it ſelf at the top, the Blood clodding by it ſelf at the bottom. For the cure of this Diſeaſe, I bled largely in the Arm, and after general Purges, I us'd cooling and incraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſating Medicines of various kinds, and a Diet agreeable to theſe things, and carefully avoided Acid and Acrid and Attenuating Liquors. But theſe and many other things which it would be tedious to mention, doing no good, and fearing to provoke the Stone forward, which I ſuſpected was too big to be expell'd by Chalybeat Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, at length I left off all hopes of doing any good by them, and chiefly becauſe I had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, that ſome Old Men of my acquaintance had haſten'd their end, while they were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting in vain to cure this Diſeaſe by ſuch Remedies. Wherefore I reſolv'd to try no more,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:57356:79"/>
only by avoiding as much as I cou'd the motion of the Body, to prevent this Diſeaſe. But at length conſidering how wonderfully ſome praiſe the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thontriptick Vertue of the Seed of the Aſh-Tree, I imagin'd that if the Seed of it had ſo much Vertue, 'twas very probable that the Manna of the Aſh, ſhou'd have more; that as the Excellent Botaniſt Mr. <hi>Ray,</hi> and many other Writers ſay, not being airy Hony or coeleſtial Dew, but rather a Liquor ſweating out of the Leaves, the Trunk and Branches of Aſh-Trees in <hi>Calabria;</hi> the Truth whereof, was confirm'd to Mr. <hi>Ray,</hi> (when he travel'd <hi>Italy,)</hi> by a Learned Phyſician, who oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten gather'd Manna from the Branches and Leaves, when they were exactly cover'd with Linen Cloaths<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>See</hi> Ray's <hi>Catalogue of Engliſh Plants.</hi> Therefore being about to make the Experiment, I drank ℥ijſs of Manna diſſolv'd in <abbr>lb</abbr>ij of Whey, ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now and then a little of the Juice of Lemons, while I was purging, to quicken this Cathartick, which us'd to work ſlowly, and to render it more pleaſing to the Stomach. It can ſcarce be ſaid how much Eaſe I receiv'd about the Region of the Reins, by the uſe of this Remedy; for tho' before they did not alwas ake, yet they were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with a heavy and troubleſome Pain. And becauſe it ſucceeded ſo well with me, I took the ſame Cathartick on a ſet Day once a Week, for ſome Months; and after every Purge, I plainly found my ſelf better and could bear the ſhaking of a Coach when it went faſt, and was indeed wholly freed from this Symptom till the laſt Spring, at the approach whereof, having been miſerably af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with the Gout all the foregoing Winter,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:57356:79"/>
and by reaſon of my unfitneſs for motion, having liv'd without Exerciſe more than I us'd to do, the Bloody Urine return'd again; and now I doubted whether I ſhou'd betake my ſelf again to purging, becauſe of late years, the whole ſubſtance of my Body being as it were, turn'd into the Fomes of the Gout, the gentleſt Purge did moſt certainly occaſion a Fit of the Gout; at length I conſider'd, that if I gave a Paregorick every Night after purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to quiet the Tumult the Purge had rais'd, I might ſafely reſume my old method of taking Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na once a Week. Therefore in the Morning I took ℥ijſs of Manna in <abbr>lb</abbr>ij of Whey, and in the Evening xvi of liquid Laudanum in Small-Beer, repeating the Manna and Laudanum in the ſaid manner, twice a Week for Three Weeks; afterwards I us'd the Manna only once a Week, the Filth of the Humours being ſo copiouſly diſcharg'd by the Cathartick, that the Gout was not greatly to be fear'd, and my reaſon telling me, that if the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na was endow'd with any Faculty that is diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, or any other way Lithontriptic, to be ſure the Vertue and Efficacy of the Remedy I truſted in, wou'd be ſomewhat leſſen'd by ſuch an aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Medicine as Laudanum is; and therefore I thought it better to omit the Hypnotic, ſeeing I purg'd only once a Week. I continued this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod ſome Months, always purging of the ſame day of the Week; nor wou'd I break this Cuſtom, upon any account whatever. Tho' the pain of the Back remitted after the firſt Doſe of this Remedy as formerly, yet ſoon after purging repeated, made the Gout appear, threatning War ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the Limbs, and ſometimes in the Bowels;
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:57356:80"/>
but Laudanum ſtrongly repreſs'd theſe Motions of the Diſeaſe: And this method ſucceeding well hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, I thought I ought to continue it, both to prevent the return of the Bloody Urine, and to leſſen ſomewhat the Matter that generates the Stone, which anſwer'd according to my deſire, this Hemorrhage wholly vaniſhing from the time I firſt publiſh'd this Treatiſe, and therefore I quite left off the Manna. Therefore as to purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, (if there is a Bloody Urine, and if Manna be only us'd according to the method above deliver'd) I muſt retract my opinion which I publiſh'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Gout, <hi>viz.</hi> that 'tis no way fit that People ſubject to the Gout, ſhou'd be purg'd either at the beginning, or at the declination, or in the Intervals of the Fit. For then it did not come into my Mind, that the Fit occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd by the Purge, cou'd be reſtrain'd, by giving an Hypnotic at Night. Yet with reſpect only to the Gout, all Evacuations do much hurt, and therefore are not to be admitted, unleſs the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Symptom requires the uſe of them.</p>
            <p>I will add theſe things concerning the Regimen and manner of Diet, which ſeems to me, proper for thoſe that are troubl'd with either of theſe Diſeaſes; for I wou'd by no means paſs by any thing that may be of uſe to thoſe that are afflicted with the ſame Diſeaſes I am. In the Morning when I riſe, I drink a Diſh or Two of Tea, and then ride in my Coach till Noon; when I return home, I moderately refreſh my ſelf with any ſort of Meat of eaſie Digeſtion that I like; (for Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is neceſſary above all things) preſently after Dinner every day, I drink ſomewhat more
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:57356:80"/>
than a quarter of a Pint of Canary Wine, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the Concoction of the Meat in my Stomach, and to drive the Gout from my Bowels: When I have dined, I betake my ſelf to my Coach again, and when I have leiſure, I ride into the Country Two or Three Miles for good Air. A Draught of Small-Beer, is to me inſtead of a Supper, and I take another Draught when I am in Bed and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to compoſe my ſelf to Sleep, that by this Julap I may cool and dilute the hot and acrid Juices lodg'd in the Kidnies, whereof the Stone is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated. And I prefer at this time, and at Dinner-time, Small-Beer that has Hops in it, before that which has none. For tho' that which is not hopt, is ſmoother and ſofter, and ſo fitter to carry off the Stone from the Kidnies, yet that which is hopt, by reaſon of the ſtiptic quality which the Hops impart to it, is not ſo apt to generate ſandy and ſtony Matter, as that which is not hopt; the Subſtance whereof, is more viſcous and ſlimy. I take care to go to Bed early, eſpecially in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, than which nothing is better to render the Concoctions perfect, and likewiſe to preſerve that Form and Order which of right, belongs to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Whereas on the contrary, Night-works leſſen all the Concoctions of Old Men that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour with any Chronical Diſeaſe, and danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly wound their Vital Principle. And to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent a Bloody Urine by reaſon of the Stone, I take great care that as often as I am to ride a long way upon the Stones, (for if I travel never ſo far in a Coach in the common Roads, I receive no damage) to drink a large Draught of Small-Beer before I go into the Coach, and alſo before
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:57356:81"/>
my Return, if I have been abroad a pretty while, whereby I ſecure my ſelf very well from the Bloody Urine. But as to the Gout, I will add this one thing, of late Years by reaſon of ſome Errors about the Six Non-naturals, the Gouty Matter ſometimes ſtrikes in, the Signs whereof are violent Sickneſs with Vomiting, and ſome pain of the Belly, the Limbs in the mean while are ſuddenly free from Pain, and more fit for motion than is uſual. In this caſe I drink a Gallon of Poſſet-Drink, or Small Beer, and as ſoon as 'tis all rejected by Vomiting, I drink a ſmall Draught of Canary Wine, with Eighteen Drops of Liquid Laudanum in it to compoſe me to reſt; and by this means I have divers times reſcued my ſelf from imminent Death.</p>
            <p>Though perhaps it may ſeem ridiculous, (eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially for one who's being well or dead, is ſcarce of any conſequence,) to make ſuch fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent mention of one's ſelf, yet theſe things are ſaid, to the intent others may be benefited thereby, whoſe Lives or Health are of greater value or moment.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, 'tis to be noted into what great danger ſome that are afflicted with the Gout and Stone caſt themſelves, by taking unadviſedly Manna diſſolv'd in Purging Mineral Waters; for though when 'tis taken this way, it works quicker, and is not ſo nauſeous, yet theſe little Convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies can't equal an Injury occaſion'd by the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters on another account. For if the Stone in the Kidnies is ſo large, that it can't paſs through the paſſage of the Ureters into the Bladder, theſe Waters moſt commonly occaſion a Fit, which
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:57356:81"/>
indures to the great hazard of the Patient's Life, till the Stone returns into the <hi>Pelvis.</hi> Nor can the Sick ſafely venture upon Chalybeat Waters, unleſs he can can certainly know firſt that the Stone is not ſo large, but that it may either find or make a way through the Ureters, which ſo far as I underſtand, can be known only certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this way; <hi>viz.</hi> If before he has been ſeiz'd with a Nephritick Fit, (with violent pain in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Reins, ſtretching it ſelf through the paſſages of the Ureters with violent Vomiting,) he has found that there is not ſo properly a large Stone in the <hi>Pelvis,</hi> as a heap of ſmall Stones, whereof one will now and then fall into the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reter, and ſo cauſe a Fit, which does not go off 'till the Stone is thruſt down into the Bladder. When the caſe is ſo, there's no more effectual Remedy, either to prevent the increaſe of ſmall Stones, or to drive them from the Reins, than the Drinking freely of Chalybeat Waters a long while every Summer.</p>
            <p>But becauſe it often happens, that one is ſeiz'd with a Nephritick Fit, when theſe Mineral Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are not to be got, or when the Seaſon of the Year is not favourable for drinking of them. In this caſe you muſt proceed in that ſhort Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod for the Stone in the Kidnies, mention'd at the latter end of the foregoing Chapter. But if the Sick is of a Sanguine Conſtitution, and not Antient, ℥x of Blood muſt be firſt taken from the Arm of the ſame ſide with the affected Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</p>
            <p>But Old Men worn out by ſome Chronical Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe, and Old Women ſubject to Vapours, (eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:57356:82"/>
if at the beginning they void a black and Sandy Urine,) muſt not bleed; but as to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, they muſt proceed wholly according to the Method now deliver'd.</p>
            <p>But to return to the Stone when 'tis large, the buſineſs in Hand, if the Nephritick Perſon was never ſeiz'd with a Fit of the Stone, that being too large to fall out of the <hi>Pelvis,</hi> Iron Waters can't be us'd for Reaſons above-mention'd, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out preſent danger. Nor does the uſe of Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Waters prove better in Gouty People, if they are old, as they are moſt commonly, and of a Weak and Phlegmatick habit of Body, for in theſe the ſtrengh of Nature is ſo much leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen'd, that 'tis greatly to be fear'd that ſuch a quantity of Water may wholly overwhelm it. But whether this is the cauſe of the Injury that falls upon Men of ſuch a habit of Body or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution or not, I am ſure many whoſe Bodies have been much broken by this Diſeaſe, have been kill'd by theſe Waters.</p>
