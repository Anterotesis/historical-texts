            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Although the Prophet <hi>Ieremy,</hi> saith that <hi>the heart is deceitfull and wicked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all things, who can know it?</hi> None, indeed, can know the heart of another man, nor how it stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth affected, but by his outward behauiour and conuersation, which hee may dissemble to men; but God will examine, and finde out his most inward, euill and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly affections, how cunningly


<pb n="254" facs="tcp:20510:133"/>
soeuer they be dissembled, for, <hi>hee seeth not as man seeth, man looketh vpon the outward appearance, but the Lord beholdeth the most se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret affections of the heart.</hi> But a man that is not partiall, and loues not to deceive himselfe in his own vaine imaginations, by little search may finde how and whereunto his owne heart is most affected. And happy is hee that findeth his heart affected, as were the <hi>Iewes</hi> at the preaching of <hi>John Baptist</hi>; By whose eager loue and desire of the Word, euen <hi>the Kingdome of God suffered violence</hi>; And through their violent affections, they seemed <hi>to take it by force</hi>: there was such forwardnesse and zeale in them to heare the Word, as they vsed a godly striuing to get it, which godly and violent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection God himself approueth.</p>

                  <p>Some againe are partiall in their affections towards their children, seeming to affect one intirely, and to disrespect another meerely, wherein there may bee cause in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of <hi>Vertue</hi> or <hi>Vice,</hi> but if it proceed onely of carnall respects, it is reprouable: <hi>Jsaac</hi> loued <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sau,</hi> more than hee loued <hi>Iacob;

                  <p>Thus doth blind <hi>affection</hi> often incounter the light, euen of diuine <hi>reason.</hi> And yet wee see strongest carnall affections variable: what a man affecteth to day, he loatheth tomorrow; what he tenderly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth now, hee reiecteth within a while.

                  <p>It is the nature of the corrupt affections of the heart, to alter and turne as the wind. How many proud men and women haue wee

                  <p>There is no affection truely constant, that hath its beginning from any of the outward senses, because, their obiects bee in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues inconstant; What sees the eye?

                  <p>But he that affecteth Christ, he that aboue all things, truely desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth <hi>the sincere milke of the Word,</hi> Hee that thinkes nothing so deare, nothing so pretious, nothing so delightfull, nothing so commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as the assurance of his glory to come, Hee will affect nothing

On this he thinks and meditates day and night, here is his treasury, and vpon it hee sets his whole affection. Hee longeth to enioy it, as a <hi>bride</hi> her <hi>bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome</hi>: He neuer thinkes his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection perfect enough, hee striues by hearing, reading, meditating on the Word, to inflame his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction more and more; and stands in continuall feare, lest some inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our delight should worke the least extenuation of it. And therefore when he findeth any thing delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any of his outward senses, hee presently suspects it, checks it, and casts it off, as an infected garment; knowing, that as long as that hangs about him, it presseth down his deare affection of things aboue (name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

of Christ:</hi> These are thy nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest and dearest, yet ought not these so farre possesse thy heart, as if thou lose any of them, thou shouldest grudge at him that gaue them, as many weake men and women doe, as though their <hi>chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, husband,</hi> or <hi>wife,</hi> were given either to other in perpetuity: And when they dye, to shew their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection through immoderate griefe and sorrow, to bee more strongly knit vnto these mortall creatures (that are not theirs but lent them) then to God himselfe.</p>
                  <p>This is no vertue but a vice of the heart, neither can it be truely called <hi>naturall affection,</hi> though it proceed of <hi>nature,</hi> not of <hi>grace,</hi> for euen <hi>naturall affection,</hi> ought to haue this limitation, namely to extend no further than natural life, for when the life of him wee doe

                  <p>Such affections therefore, as are set vpon the transitory and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine things of this life, may bee truely termed foolish if they passe the bounds of diuine reason, for they onely savour of the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of nature, and cannot returne any sollid comfort to the heart of the affectionate.</p>
