         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>And forſmuch as We, at the Requeſt of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the Knight, Citizens, and Burgeſſes, heretofore Members of the Commons Houſe of Parliament, during the Reign of King <hi>CHARLES</hi> the Second, reſiding in and about the City of <hi>London;</hi> and the Aldermen and Members of the Common-Council of the ſaid City, aſſembled in this extraordinary Conjuncture, have taken upon Us the Adminiſtration of the publick Affairs, both Civil and Military, and the Diſpoſal of the publick Revenues of the Kingdom, for the Uſes the preſent Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs require: To which End it is neceſſary that all the publick Revenues ſhould run in their proper Channel. We do therefore hereby revoke and make void all Commiſſions and Authorities, given by Us, or by any others, as aforeſaid. And We do hereby prohibit and forbid all and every Perſon and Perſons, under pretence of the ſaid Commiſſions or any of them, to intermeddle in any of the publick Revenues, or receive any Money ariſing thereby. And we do hereby require and command all Collectors, Receivers and Officers (not being Papiſts) authorized and employed by the ſaid Commiſſioners of the Cuſtoms, Exciſe, Hearth-Money, or any other the Branches of the publick Revenue, that they proceed in the Managing, Receiving, and Levying the ſaid Revenues as formerly. And we likewiſe require all Juſtices of the Peace to proceed in the Hearing and Determining all Matters relating to the ſaid Revenues, and every of them: And that they and all other publick Officers and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, Sheriffs, Mayors, Bayliffs, Conſtables, Headboroughs, and other Officers of the Peace, be Aiding and Aſſiſting to all Officers employed and authorized by the ſaid Commiſſioners in the Collecting, Receiving, and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying the Duties ariſing by the ſaid Revenues, and every of them, as by Law they are required and directed.
