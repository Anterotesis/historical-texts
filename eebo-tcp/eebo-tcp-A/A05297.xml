         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

and his archers. Of the Messagetanes which neuer went
without their bowe and quiuer neyther in peace nor in

Of the Scithians (whose whole substance and riches of
a man being a yoake of Oxen and a plow, a Nagge and
his dogge, his bowe and his quiuer) were inuincible a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Darius and other Monarckes. To be short, the
Grecians, Persians, Athenians, and the Romanes, whose
shooting in peace and warres was worthie of praise and
fame. Neyther here ought I nor will I omit with silence
the deserued fame of our Ancestors in fauouringe this

Aurelius sirnamed Ambrose, &amp; Vther Pendragon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

by the way <hi>(Right honourable and worshipfull)</hi> as I applaude
in this their well doing, so it had beene a thing of Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
most worthelie to be wished, for that Prince him

flesh proued medicinable against all other poysons (as
saith Cardanus in his booke of Comfort.) I meane if
Vther Pendragon had wanted that serpentine poyson of
adulterie, Nigromancie &amp; murther (things odible to
God and good men:) when that most incomperable
King Arthure of great Brittaine for his princely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wesse,
valiant vertues, and triumphant victories yet
prooued more Royally renoumed throughoute all the
worlde in his time and to his posteritie. The He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brwes
with greate and not vndeserued titles extolled
their Iudas Maccabeus. Homer the glory of all Greeke
Poets left Hector and Achilles most commendable vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the worlde. Neyther by lesse diligence did the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
adorne with praise Alexander the most mightie
conquerour. And the Romanes aduanced the noble
actes of their Caesar to the Skyes not enough. The Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonians
profoundly praised Godfrey of Bulloyn (for
his noble valiancy) as the scourge of the Sarazens in his
dayes. And as euery one of those are commended with
due desert: so in like ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner there were neuer Brittaines

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>VIDENT</hi> It is, by the speciall
agreement of Greeke and Latine
writers, that <hi>Hercules</hi> was borne of
<hi>Alcmena,</hi> by the adultery of <hi>Iupiter.</hi>
But what manner of person, or how
mightie in times past hee was, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
is euen of the meanely learned
better knowne, then that at this prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
needeth any further Insinuatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And
very many others there were borne in adultery, (as by the
Auncient History largely appeareth) whose prowesse at
home, and in warres, notably excelled. Amongest whome
also our <hi>Arthure,</hi> the chiefest ornament of <hi>Brittayne,</hi> and
the onely myracle of his time, florished famously. May I
therefore bee so bolde by good leaue of <hi>Gulielmus Paruus,</hi>

euen with condigne praises to commend my country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

a man not altogether vnlearned, (what soeuer otherwise per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
ignorant of antiquitie, which thinke themselues to haue
knowledge, shall say) as vnto a firme defence, rather then
vnto the fond fables or base stuffe of forraine writers. Truly,
in fables which haue crept into the history of <hi>Arthure,</hi> I doe
not more delite, then <hi>Polidorus,</hi> the Iudge. But to bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraide
of any man by reason of his greate age, or eloquence, or
authoritie, finally as like a foolish forsaker of the truth, I
shoulde so leaue her partes vndefended: that certainely will I
neuer doe:<note place="margin">The Authours good purpose in this worke.</note> An other way, do equity, honesty, the rule of

such tryfling matters I do not much force to write. But by

He also contendeth that euen all the whole worlde by

               <p>ANd because I haue againe entred into the Misteries of

into the bowels thereof, it liketh me to bring forth to light
an other matter, namely <hi>Arthures</hi> Seale, a monume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t most
cunningly engrauen, auncient, and reuerent. Concerninge
which,<note place="margin">He meaneth Robert Caxto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who translated the history of K. Arthure.</note> 
                  <hi>Caxodunus</hi> maketh mention, yet breefly and sclen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
in his preface to the history of <hi>Arthure:</hi> which the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
people readeth printed in the English tongue. Being
moued with the testimony of <hi>Caxodunus</hi> whatsoeuer it
were, I went vnto <hi>Westminster,</hi> to the end that what so
as an eare witnesse I had heard,<note place="margin">K. Arthures Seale kept at Westminster in Iohn Ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landes dayes.</note> I might at length also as an

               </p>
               <p>The keeper of those secretes being requested of mee to shew
me this monument, by and by delyuered it both to bee seene
and handled.<note place="margin">His reporte in praise thereof, describing the properties</note> The sight of the Antiquitie pleased me at full,
and for a long time the Maiestie thereof not onely drewe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
but also detayned myne eyes from me to the beholding
thereof. Of such force it is for a man aptly to chaunce vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a thing with greate care desired. The substance which
tooke the most lyuelyest figure of <hi>Arthure</hi> imprinted vpon
the Seale, (and which as yet doth firmely keepe the same
still) is ware of redde coloure, which by some mishape, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iury
of long time perished, is crazed here &amp; there into peeces.
But so yet notwithstanding as no part of it is altogether lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.
For the fragmentes or litle peeces thereof being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
time by some mischaunce crazed, are so closed vp toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with siluer plates which is of rounde forme, such as is
the vtter side of the Seale, that no parte of them may fall
off. For vpon the vtterside of this seale it is thus engraued
with these breefe, but in very deede most excellent, most
hauty, and most magnificent tytles. That is to say.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:8884:21"/>

And of trueth this inscription circleth the outermost
compasse of the Seale. The former parte thereof is most
bright shining by a circle of christall, which being taken off,
streightway may any man touch the war, which by reason of
the Antiquitie is most harde. But the Portracture of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thure</hi>
printed thereupon,<note place="margin">K. Arthures maiestie repre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sented on the seale.</note> resembleth I wotte neare what
Heroyicall Maiestie. For the <hi>Prince</hi> as it were inuested

shineth like the sunne. In his right hand riseth vp a scepter
wrought with a <hi>Flowerdeluce</hi> at the toppe: And his left
hand holdeth a globe adorned with a crosse. His bearde al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
groweth comely, large, and at length, and euen that is a
maiestie. The other side of the Seale is altogether couered
ouer with a thinne plate of Siluer. By meanes wherof
also it is vncertaine of what fashion it is. There hangeth
downe at the same a string chainefashionlike twisted of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer.
Certes Reader, I pray God I be deade but thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
desire to see the same, such and so greate is both the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie
and also the maiesty of the thing. At length the keeper
of those secretes was there requested by me to signifie vnto
me, if he had learned any thing ouer and besides this, as
touching the seale hanging thereat. For, amongest very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ornaments which glittering with Gold &amp; precious stones
did adorne the tombe of <hi>Edwarde</hi> the <hi>Simple,</hi>

euen this also was worthie of memorie. But he coulde

memorie of the most high and mighty prince <hi>Arthure.</hi>
Surely if a man might lawefully by any coniectures gather
and set downe the trueth in writing, I would not thinke that
such a seale had benee translated from <hi>Glastenburie:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">It was transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from Glas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenbury to Westminster.</note> vppon
which monastery (by misfortune of fire most filthily debased)
the most bountifull prince bestowed such rewardes, as hee
for his excellent godlines might more easily giue, then those

<pb facs="tcp:8884:22"/>
mentioned, made testimony of <hi>Arthures</hi> free gift, and so
farre forth as he both sawe and read the same. By meanes
whereof also it might come to passe, that the parchment
beeing eaten out with little wormes, and meathes by
long tract of time, so famous a monument of antiquitie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
founde, he deliuered the same to the Monasterie of first
fame, there to be kept safe, and to be seene for euer of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylitie
in all posterities. Certes (except my coniecture faileth
me) the expences or charge is small in deede, yea, none at all.
This yet in the meane time pleaseth me, that while we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate
of <hi>Arthure</hi> and of things done by him, <hi>Glastenbury</hi>
is alwaies at hand and most friendly promiseth his endeuour
towardes assured knowledge of things. From whence in

persons (leaning rather to their opinion, selfe will, and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

But after this we will chuse a place, wherein by full &amp; whole
aboundance of argumentes, wee may ouerthrowe the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
rabble of slaunderers. In the meane season wee must
more subtilely discusse the inscription of the Seale. For, this

both with greater pleasure, and also apter grace fill y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eares of

<hi>Mordred</hi> blaming <hi>Fortunes</hi> vntowardnesse, with a Nauy

scituate from the Salte water of <hi>Seuerne:</hi> by meanes wherof,
(but yet mixed with salte waters) it runneth downe lower

there is a famous place, somewhat more fruitfull of grasse

               <p>And King <hi>Arthure</hi> was buryed verie deeply for feare of
the <hi>Saxons,</hi> whom he had often times vanquished, &amp; whome
he had altogether reiected or cast out of the Isle of <hi>Brittaine.</hi>
And whome <hi>Mordred</hi> his mischeeuous Nephew had first

they (should also with mallice of minde raige in crueltie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
the deade body) which had laboured by tooth &amp; naile
euen now to possesse againe the whole Island after his death.
Againe for and in respect of the same feare, he was laide in a
certaine broade stone, (as it were at a graue) found of them
which digged there, of seauen foote as it were vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth:
when yet notwithstanding <hi>Arthures</hi> Tombe was founde
more lower, of nyne foote depth. There was moreouer

               <p>And the Crosse taken out of the stone, (the saide Abbot

haue reade these letters. But like as the Crosse was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fired
to the neathermost parte of the stone: So that parte
of the crosse engrauen (to the ende it might bee more secrete)
was turned towardes the stone. Doubtlesse a wonderfull

who by all endeuoures desired to hide in secret manner
the body of so greate a personage, and their Soueraigne

that at one or other time afterwardes (when the trouble
surceased, by the perfect order of those letters engrauen in
the Crosse and found out other whiles) they might make
apparant testimonies of his buriall.</p>
               <p>And as the foresaide King <hi>Henry</hi> had before declared all

namely that they should finde him buried deepely in

euen admirable or wonderfull: but the enterprises &amp;

that almost they made them none at all.</p>
               <p>For the matter was so handled by them, that they woulde
elegantly and not truly pleade their cause. They painted
out such thinges in writinges, which they might rather law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully

so farre forth, that honour vnto learning was rare, &amp;
rewardes for the same, were most rarely vnder stoode off.
And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter was not handled by writers but by warriers.
Wherefore if any certaine thing were written as touchinge


<pb n="36" facs="tcp:8884:42"/>
Arthure the same might rather bee done of the <hi>Brittaine</hi>
writers what manner persons so euer they were, then of the

from the function or office of writing, but also carefully thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
vpon their owne wretched estate and calamitie, dayly
faling vpon them by many meanes, lettinge passe all other
thinges.</p>
               <p>An other brabler after this alledgeth, more vaine matters
are in <hi>Arthures</hi> History conteyned then that they may tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
be allowed of him that is of ripe iudgement, and discréet
knowledge. If he meane touching that History which is
reade amongest the common sorte in the <hi>Italian, Spanish,
Frenche</hi> and <hi>English</hi> tongues, I do not much striue with
him. Although the vpright reader shall call to minde, the same
thing hath beene often times done, euen in the History each
where forraine of <hi>Charles, Rowlande, Godfrey, Guy,</hi> and
<hi>Bellouse,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Most puysant Personages haue beene parcyally pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in truth.</note> that I may let passe many others. Neyther yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
are their names, or credit of the true History
taken away the more. It is no noueltie, that men mixe tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flinge
toyes with true thinges, and surely this is euen done
with a certaine employment that writers might captiuate y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>

so was <hi>Alexander,</hi> so <hi>Arthure,</hi> and so was also <hi>Charles</hi>

to the History of <hi>Arthure,</hi> then I do conceaue of. For
those thinges which are not apparant in course of ages, which
are not probable, which as aliable helpes agree not with the

vainelie hath also added many thinges after the deuice and

he vpon a stomake and contempte. But I will sing him a

               <p>Well I knowe, and that too well, manie fables and vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

then vnderstood by <hi>William Paruus</hi> beare not any shewe at

honourable testimony, namely not onely touching the
Interpreter of the historie, but also concerning <hi>Arthure</hi> him
selfe. Plainly it appeareth, that whatsoeuer thinges this fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
published in writing (concerning <hi>Arthure,</hi> and <hi>Merline</hi>

in knowledge of thinges naturall, and especially in the

acceptable and that deseruingly vnto the <hi>Princes</hi> of his time,

himselfe as one subiect vnto y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> iudgement of any cowled

<hi>Arthure</hi> and <hi>Merline,</hi> the one more valiant, the other

him selfe a perpetuall wounde and bloodshedde. Neither is
there cause why hee should hope for the present helpe of that

vnwise, if I should so doe. Onely I purposed of good wil
to make tryall of my wit in a matter honest, to helpe the
history languishing, to aduance the glory of my country,
hindred by enuy, and beeing enthralled vnto the crafty
deceiptes of euill willers, restore the same honestly vnto

enemies will assaulte my doinges: Let them ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

I will imitate the Noble <hi>Palme Tree,</hi> which beeing
pressed downe with heauie burdens yet falleth not to

seeke for any reward: so you vouchsafe me your courtesy,
