            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Sir,</hi> It is to all the world apparent, that there is no Party that by their Principles ſtand more inclined and affected to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Government, that is, to Monarchy, then they: For they fought for their then Monarch, even for Monarchy ſake; not for him as he was <hi>Charls Stuart,</hi> but as that their <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Nay, <hi>Sir,</hi> in that, we did not only ſhew good affection to this preſent Government, but to You our preſent Governor; yes, and fought for You too, and that when You fought againſt Your ſelf. For, <hi>Sir,</hi> it cannot be denied, but that as You are more eminently Your ſelf now then before, as being <hi>by the grace of God</hi> advanced to that power You had not then; ſo alſo, in fighting for him, who was by relation our then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Protector, we did fight for You your ſelf, our preſent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector now.</p>
            <p>But it may be objected, that there are ſome that have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived perſonal prejudice againſt You.

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IT was to me an unhappy diverſion, when the Civil diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of my Country about matter of Government and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, had bereſt me of that Imployment wherein before my livelihood did conſiſt, and only furniſhed me with a melancholy leiſure to reflect upon the true grounds and juſtice of quarrels of like nature. Which being at firſt done for my own ſatisfaction only, during the time of that contention, came afterwards to ſuch bulk, as that by the advice of ſome that were well-willers to Peace, I was perſwaded to ſend it abroad into the World for the ſatisfaction of others, in way of prevention of what might happen in like caſe for the future.</p>
            <p>But then again, propoſing to my ſelf to become as effectual herein as I could, and conſidering how prone ſuch as had been of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary party and oppoſite to Monarchy, might be to object partiality to me in reference to that relation I bore to the late King and the Court, I was the more wary not to let any thing ſlip that might ſeem to have perſonal reſpect: But as I had from Scripture and Reaſon found Monarchy to be the beſt and only right form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, ſo to let them ſee that it was not for any one Monarchs ſake I did it; but out of a deſire to maintain perpetual peace and unity amongſt us, I aſſerted this obedience to be continually due to that Perſon which God in his providence ſhould ſet over us. And truly I have looked upon ſubmiſſion and conformity to the preſent Power, not only as neceſſary in reſpect of duty and care of publick peace and benefit, but for advance of private wiſhes too, be they on which ſide they will: Not only fitteſt to be given to him that by Divine appointment is to be ſetled in this power, but alſo to be given in caſe he ſhould be removed; for that the ſooner that work is done, and he brought to that height which God hath decreed, the ſooner ſhall he be taken away, and ſome other put in his place.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:55989:3"/>That which I then did to avoid imputation of partiality, hath been by ſome on the other ſide conceived as an Apoſtacie from the true Principles of the <hi>Royaliſt,</hi> and as ſavouring both of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude to the laſt, and of flattery to him that is now in power. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon which accompt they have alſo condemned whatſoever is by me done in conformity to any preſent Eſtabliſhment in the outward profeſſion of Religion; as not deeming what was before ſetled in that kind by the former Higher Power, can be legally abrogated by this. In anſwer to all which I ſhall deſire it may be conſidered, that I undertake not to write as a Servant, but as a Subject, and of the duty of ſubjection and obedience as indefinitely put, and abſtracted from all perſonal regard. It was not the ſcope of my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to compare perſon with perſon, or to ſhew which of them I was moſt obliged unto, or would for my own part have choſen either for my Prince or Maſter; but to ſet forth that duty which became me and all men elſe, as conſidered in the common relation of Subjects: which being impartially done, I doubt not but it will to others, as it hath done to my ſelf, appear, that (in order to the manifeſtation of Gods glory) all the means for mans preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation ought to be endeavoured; that mans preſervation, peace and charity having a neceſſary dependance on ſubmiſſion to the authority of ſome one, that ſhall be in all cauſes and over all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as well Eccleſiaſtical as Civil, next under Chriſt ſupreme Head and Governor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it could not but follow, that he only was to be obeyed in things of this nature. And that the means to Peace, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity and Charity may at no time be wanting, I have determined obedience to be given to him that ſhall be from time to time poſſeſſed of this high place of Supremacie and power. And theſe things I have made the Arguments of the three Chapters of this Treatiſe. The firſt to ſhew the true riſe and ſcope of Religion; the next to ſhew what the n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

All which being cleered, I preſume that thoſe cenſures which paſſed on me and others for hearing or receiving where Common-Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>yer or other Ceremonies were not uſed, or for hearing of ſuch as (I might ſuſpect at leaſt) were not ordained as heretofore, and the like, would be found to be grounded more on prejudice then reaſon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:55989:3"/>In the firſt larger Book of <hi>Government and Obedience,</hi> having (as I ſaid) an especial aim to the ſatisfaction of ſuch as were neither convinced in the right of Kingly government, nor of that fulneſs of power that belonged thereunto; I made uſe of no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in proof of what I ſaid, ſave that of Scripture and Reaſon; both becauſe theſe were not only the beſt and true authorities, as alſo for that (generally) with them all humane authority was not regarded But now being put to queſtion what are the true Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the <hi>Cavalier</hi> or <hi>Royaliſt,</hi> to the end it may be known whether I, in my conformity, or others, in their recuſancie, have beſt followed them; it muſt be expected I ſhould quote ſome of the moſt Reverenced and Orthodox Authorities in our Church that have treated of things of this nature. And if in any thing in this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe I ſhall be conceived ſhort of the proof intended, recourſe may be had to the former Volume, where moſt of the ſame queſtions are more largely handled; unto which this was intended as a ſupple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in ſome part only.</p>
            <p>And for fear any ſhould miſtake or conclude me diſreſpectful to the <hi>Service-book</hi> or former Ceremonies, becauſe I am now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading to conformity in alteration; I ſhall in this caſe alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire them to conſider, that I am not now taking upon me the part of a Judg or Law-maker, and comparing thoſe Forms and Rights with any other of like kind, ſo as to eſtimate which were best and moſt convenient to be received as to ſeparate worth in themſelves; but writing now as a Son or Member of a Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by her authority already, the caſe will be found much different.</p>
            <p>As I am not ſo partial to my ſelf, as not to conceive my own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiencie may be a cauſe why in many particulars my Proofs and Reaſons are no more ſatisfactory and convincing: So, on the other ſide again, being to write in defence of Authority, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade to Obedience, I muſt expect that both my ſelf and work ſhall be vulgarly entertained with a Cenſure ſuitable to what Mr<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Hooke</hi> armed himſelf againſt, when he wrote againſt the Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſts of his time, viz. <hi>He that goeth about to perſwade a multitude, that they are not ſo well governed as they ought to be, ſhall never want attentive and favorable hearers, becauſe they know the manifold defects whereunto every kind of Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

And becauſe ſuch as openly reprove ſuppoſed diſorders of State, are taken for prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal friends to the common benefit of all, and for men that carry ſingular freedom of mind; under this fair and plauſible colour, whatſoever they utter paſſeth for good and current: That which wanteth in the weight of their ſpeech, is ſupplied by the aptneſs of mens minds to accept and believe it. Whereas on the other ſide, if we maintain things that are eſtabliſhed, we have not only to ſtrive with a number of heavy prejudices deeply rooted in the hearts of men, who think that herein we ſerve the time, and ſpeak in favor of the preſent State, becauſe thereby we either hold or ſeek preferment; but alſo to bear with ſuch except<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The grounds of prejudice and averſion, are (I muſt confeſs) na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ſtrong and preſſing, especially when they come to that height (as mine did) to be thereby deprived of all. But when we ſhall have laid that paſſion aſide which might ariſe from the thoughts of our former condition, and conſulted with Reaſon, of what in conſcience and prudence is fitteſt to be reſolved on in the condition we now ſtand, I doubt not but thoſe Motives that have prevailed with me, will prevail with others alſo, that the remainder of our life may be led with more comfort. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon which hope I have thus expoſed my ſelf to publick view; as mindful of that admonition of our Saviour to <hi>S.</hi> Peter; <hi>And thou being converted, ſtrengthen thy brethren.</hi> Which God Almighty grant.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hings that have life, are eſſentially diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from thoſe that want, by particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſenſation of their own perfections and enjoyments. And as they are again ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fically diſtinguiſhed and differenced from one another by degree of perfection and beatitude, ſo alſo by degree of vigor and reliſh in fruition. For as it is an abatement to happineſs to have ſenſe of loſs or pain intermixed; ſo is it alſo an increaſe thereunto, to be perceptible thereof in the higheſt degree of ſatisfaction and aſſurance. In which regard, ſince evidence of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatneſs and fruition muſt be increaſed through increaſe of extention and emanation iſſuing from it ſelf, and that again increaſed through increaſe of thoſe objects whereon it worketh (whereby as the Print from the Seal, the party poſſeſſed may find it ſelf in degree more fully and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully therewith endued:) It muſt therefore come to paſs, that as it is moſt natural in God to be in the higheſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure perfect and happy, ſo alſo to be communicative or good, and in goodneſs again to be enlarged and apparent.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55989:5"/>
For to be bleſſed or happy, as to ſelf-reſpect alone, argues not ſo plainly an immenſity in any thing as to be extenſive herein to others, without other confinement ſave that of its own good pleaſure. That incomprehenſible degree of wiſdom and power which in the beginning of time did ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt it ſelf in the whole Creation, took effect from that innate propenſion to beneficence, which before all time was in the Creator himſelf: Omnipotencie ſerving as the means to accompliſh that which Goodneſs had firſt deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as its end.</p>
               <p>1. Conſequent to the work of Creation is that of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence: For as it was a work proper to the prime Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to make things perfect and happy, ſo likewiſe to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In which reſpect (again) it muſt farther fall out, that as evidence of poſſeſſion and perfection was increaſed from the ſignature thereof upon other things, even ſo alſo, for farther manifeſtation of the worth and force of the energie and impreſſion (as to goodneſs and bounty) it was onwards neceſſary, that according to thoſe degrees of bleſſings and benefits received, there ſhould be in the Receiver a higher meaſure of reſentment implanted, the which we uſually comprehend under the name of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. For, theſe things which of meer grace and mercy do from divine bounty fall on any Senſitive, when they come to be received by that Senſitive as beneficial and good, cannot naturally be otherwiſe atteſted then by and under that conception; Pleaſure it ſelf being no otherwiſe evil or for bidden, then as depriving us of ſome more large and laſting delight.</p>
               <p>2. Which pleaſure again, as it is by each ſenſitive pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued as its end, by the wiſe diſpenſation of the Creator it is ſo ordered, that it ſhould be not only in the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree communicated to things which are of greateſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, but alſo to ſuch actions of their moſt eminently annexed, as do withal tend to the preſervation and benefit of their own particulars, or that of their race and <hi>ſpecies.</hi> And therefore ſince ſome things ſtood more participant
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55989:5"/>
and ſenſible of the beatitude, perfection, and image of their Maker (by means of life, underſtanding, and will;) it will farther follow, that in reference to the more full expreſſion of his own glory and goodneſs, a more exact and greater meaſure of providence and expreſs rules ſhould be ſet down and added for their preſervation, then of things of inferior regard. That Law of Nature, and thoſe inſtincts and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties wherewith Inanimates or other ſenſitives do ſtand guided, ſeemed not ſufficient for the conduct of man; who being in a higher degree participant and ſenſible of divine reſemblance and goodneſs, ſtood not only in himſelf, like them, poſitively expreſſing Gods bounty in his own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts, but, beyond them, by means of his reaſon and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect, able to acknowledg even thoſe benefits which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf or others had received, and ſo become a more expreſs witneſs of his Makers favor and glory.</p>
               <p>3. From hence it comes to paſs that men, like other ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitives, are not only naturally led by ſenſe of pleaſure to the proſecution of thoſe things that tend to ſpecifical or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſervation, (in order to the accompliſhment of his will, that ordains his bounty to be extended as well to the individuals that for the preſent are, as to the ſucceſſive generations of them to be by this means brought forth and made participants thereof) but alſo by another Law pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to themſelves, even the Law of Reaſon, can apprehend and acquire that which is in a fuller degree fit for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves alſo to execute, either for their own avail, or that of others. And therefore when again we find, that there is in all things naturally implanted a certain degree of love and delight unto thoſe things unto which they are moſt uſually aſſociated and converſant; even ſo we find Mankind not only, like them, won to love and liking of one another by means of ſociety, but by diſcourſe and reaſon, being in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree made ſenſible of the benefit and pleaſure which other things receive by means of the expreſſion of this his love towards them, and alſo of his duty in doing, he is by ſenſe of honor as well naturally and politically enforced, as by
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55989:6"/>
encouragement from above ſtrengthened and directed in this reſolution.</p>
               <p>4. The paſſed diſcourſe being ſummed up, and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned towards the diſcovery of mans duty, will eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover that juncture and coincidence that is between the Precepts of the Firſt and Second Table. We may find why God that cannot, as in any proper regard, be any ways ſteaded or ſerved by us, doth yet reckon of our ſervices to one another as a ſervice to himſelf; according to that ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>David, My goodneſs extendeth not to thee, but to the Saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent,</hi> Pſ. 16. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3. Or that of <hi>Job, Can a man be profitable unto God, as he that is wiſe may be profitable unto himſelf?</hi> Job 22. 2. And again, <hi>If thou ſinneſt, what doſt thou againſt him?</hi> ch. 35<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6. <hi>Or if thou be righteous, what giveſt thou him? Thy wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs may hurt a man as thou art, and thy righteouſneſs may profit the ſon of man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All which would be well conſidered of by ſuch as, in a miſtaken or miſgrounded zeal to Gods honor, Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, Gods glory, Gods worſhip (as they uſe to phraſe it, and to be performed in ſuch a meaſure and manner as they are perſwaded is beſt and trueſt) are ready to make him apparently to act againſt himſelf, and will themſelves be his Agents even <hi>to kill men under colour of doing him good ſervice.</hi> Theſe men are to conſider, that if Gods honor or glory had, under the Goſpel, been tied to any ſuch preciſe outward form of Worſhip, it had been eaſie with him at firſt, and eaſie every day it ſtill is, to make ſuch exact de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of his will therein, that none can make doubt or ſcruple thereof; as amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> he did. But he now requiring chiefly the devotion of our hearts, and leaving all things diſputable, in the meaſure and manner of any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Form, <hi>to thoſe that have the rule over us,</hi> we do then diſ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>ſerve him, when we break Charity and Order, and make a Schiſm in our ſervice to him.</p>
               <p>And ſince God doth not only take care for mans Being, (which is politically included under the notion of <hi>Peace</hi>) but
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55989:6"/>
of his Well-being alſo (which we may compriſe under the term of <hi>Plenty</hi>) to the end that through the ſenſe and pleaſure of his enjoyments he may be ſtirred up to praiſe and acknowledg him; it is therefore farther to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, that even in thoſe duties that are apparently to be performed towards God, as being expreſly commanded for perpetuity in Scripture, as duties of the firſt Table, there be not yet ſo violent a preſſure made, or yoke laid on the back of fleſh and blood, as to defeat the end of the ſecond Table, Mans good, and make his ſervice ſeem alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether a burthen. And therefore they that are ſo ready to fancie to themſelves an eminent proficience in piety, out of the more ſtrict obſervation of ſome one or two Precepts, as the Phariſees of old were wont to do in the ſtrict ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Sabbath, even to the neglect of the reſt, are to remember our Saviors anſwer to the ſame Phariſees, <hi>That the Sabbath was made for man, not man for it.</hi> For as the ſenſe of pleaſure and enjoyment was implanted as well to witneſs Gods bounty, as to provoke us to gratitude; therefore unneceſſarily to abate mans pleaſure, is to abate Gods glory: Which ſhould have been conſidered of them that, for fear of breaking the Sabbath-day, would now turn it into a day of faſting and mourning. They are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member how that Evangelical Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> Chap. 1. is declaiming againſt thoſe things that were done in more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect ſervice to God, as <hi>Sacrifice, Prayers,</hi> and the like, and directs them to the obſervance of thoſe things that tended to Charity, as a more ready way to ſerve and pleaſe him; To <hi>abſtain from blood, to ſeek judgment, to relieve the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, the fatherleſs, the widow,</hi> and the like. They are to conſider, that although God doth ſet down his own ſervice firſt, and ſtrictly call for our faith and fear towards him, (as well knowing that according to our fear and confidence in him, our obſervance of his laws will follow) yet doth he always aim at our good, to be gained or ſtrengthened by any religious obſervance. In which regard we may well know how to interpret that ſpeech of S. <hi>Paul, He that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55989:7"/>
provideth not for his family hath denied the faith, and is worſe then an Infidel.</hi> Where in an Oec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="4 letters">
                     <desc>••••</desc>
                  </gap>ical inſtance he ſpeaketh of that force which Chriſtian Religion, upon its true ground and intent, ſhould have in the promoting of all moral vertues beſides: Inſomuch as not to do the one, is to deny the other, and to become worſe then he that hath no faith in Chriſt at all, becauſe he wanted that divine direction and ecouragement thereunto.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, for want of due conſideration of theſe things, and how <hi>Charity is the end of the Law,</hi> it is, that men are generally ſo ſuperſtitious, and ſo diſconſolate and unſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in their religious performances; even ſo as to become <hi>Quakers, Seekers,</hi> and what not? For while they guide themſelves in their actions, without due ſenſe or regard how theſe things are both of them by Rules of Religion made mutually ſerviceable to the ſame end, they do loſe their Religion by this irregular and partial ſeeking of it in one ſort only; even by diſſolving and diſjoining thoſe things <hi>which God hath</hi> thereby <hi>joined together.</hi> For as all Vertue and Morality (in regard of our inability to be ſo fully compleat as the firſt ſtrict Rule of Providence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires) is no better then Heatheniſh Philoſophy, when done without faith in Chriſt, or ſenſe of duty towards God; ſo alſo all acts of devotion proceeding from any unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table heart, or not having charitable intention, but done only out of fear or care to pleaſe or ſerve God thereby, as in things by him aimed at for himſelf, are at beſt but ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition. And therefore when our Saviour makes up our Religion by joining theſe fundamental precepts, <hi>Thou ſhalt l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ve the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and thy neighbour as thy ſelf:</hi> And when again it is ſaid, <hi>Follow peace with all, men, and holineſs, without which no man ſhall ſee the Lord:</hi> It is not for us to think of disjoining that religious tie of the Word, and to believe that by any extraordinary way of ſerving God <hi>whom we ſee n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t,</hi> or of following of ſome holy duties, we can find acceptance, if we have not (the while) a due regard to the love of our Brother <hi>whom we do ſee,</hi>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:55989:7"/>
and to follow Peace alſo. But ſince <hi>Righteouſneſs and Peace have</hi> thus <hi>kiſſed each other,</hi> Men ſhould therefore in their religious deportments ſeek to <hi>preſerve the unity of the Spirit in the bond of Peace,</hi> and even <hi>ſtudy to be quiet,</hi> by making conſcience of avoidance of ſuch things whereby ſcandal may be given or taken, to the diſturbance of their joint Communion in the ſame Profeſſion. Let men be to their utmoſt wary in communicating in acts of known ſin, becauſe nothing of that kind but tendeth to the diſhonor of God, and the general harm of men: But let them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all take heed that private prejudice, intereſt or paſſion makes them not forſake their ſociety as they are men, much leſs in what they do as Chriſtians; for that were more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly both to diſhonor God as Creator and Redeemer, and to prejudice man himſelf: For although we may and muſt hate and abandon <hi>vice</hi> and <hi>ſin,</hi> yet we may not the <hi>vitious</hi> and <hi>ſinner</hi> farther then they are ſo; but <hi>ſo far as i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> poſſible, and as much as in us lieth, to have peace with all men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7. If we look to Mankind in their firſt way of Religion, and to that condition and ability they then ſtood in, for maintenance of their duty both towards God and their neighbor; we ſhall find that in all theſe deviations or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects wherein, through private appetite and abundance of enjoyment, they might be led both to forget the Author of their benefits, and to neglect the good and preſervation of other things, their fellow-creatures, that God almighty did accept of them and what they did, while they ſhould forbear to eat of that forbidden Tree of the <hi>Knowledg of good and evil;</hi> Sacramentally put to repute them as inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent in all ſuch actions, as in a ſtrict ſenſe they might be found to deviate from the fulfilling of the whole Law or Rule of Providence, ſince they implicitely obeyed him that was the Author thereof, and took not upon them to be guided by their own knowledg of that good and evil whereto they might morally tend.</p>
               <p>8. In the ſecond eſtate, and under the Law, we may
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:55989:8"/>
apprehend God conditioning with the poſterity of him that had been moſt righteous in the keeping of the firſt Natural Law, for the obſervation of a certain number of Precepts; upon the performance whereof there was a promiſe of Juſtification, as if they had performed the whole Moral Law, or Law of Providence.</p>
               <p>9. But this being yet found too difficult, God almighty, in the third way of diſpenſation of his will, to wit, in the Evangelical Covenant, conditions with Mankind for Belief; not accepting us for any acts of our own, as our own, but as done and accepted in the name and by the merit of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; whom, by faith, we are now to apprehend and rely upon, as having in himſelf fulfilled all we ſtood outwardly bound unto, as well in reference to the firſt large Law of Providence, as to the Jewiſh abridgment thereof.</p>
               <p>10. In the firſt Covenant it was, <hi>Forbear this and live;</hi> in the ſecond, the Condition was, <hi>Do this and live;</hi> in the third, <hi>Believe this and live.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>11. If we ſhall compare theſe Covenants one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, we ſhall find the greateſt ſimilitude and agreement between the firſt and the laſt; between our ſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition under the firſt, and under the ſecond <hi>Adam.</hi> For as under the firſt, we had but one Precept to obſerve as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately divine, ſo under the ſecond alſo. Then, whereas we ſtood innocent in our deportments while guided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly by the propenſions of uncorrupted Nature; and in what we might thwart one another, ſtood obedient to our natural fathers: So here, are we innocent too, while in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly guided by Nature rectified by Grace, being <hi>all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:55989:8"/>
as lights in the world,</hi> Phil. 2: 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To which end we may obſerve our Saviour, the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> deſcribing the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie of the Evangelical eſtate to conſiſt alſo in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negation of our prying humors, when he anſwers the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees that would be ſo much guided by pride and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality in their interpretations of the written Law, without regard to the main drift of the Law: <hi>If ye were blind, you ſhould have no ſin; but now ye ſay we ſee, therefore your ſin remaineth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>12. But now, under the Law, all theſe Preceps being ſo immediately and ſtrictly given and enjoined by God himſelf to be for perpetuity, literally obſerved by all of that Nation and Covenant, no one perſon could plead exemption from that ſentence, <hi>Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things written in the Law to do them,</hi> farther then he could be to himſelf conſcious, that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his beſt enquiry he had exactly fulfilled them. Whereas under the Goſpel or New-Covenant, we ſhall find the caſe clean otherwiſe; and <hi>not as it was formerly made with our fathers, when God took them</hi> (as it were) <hi>by the hand,</hi> to guide them in their actions by Rules delivered by himſelf, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 9. But now doth it by an <hi>inward Law written in our hearts.</hi> And therefore S. <hi>Paul</hi> putting the difference between them, bringeth in the <hi>Righteouſneſs which is by the Law speaking in this wiſe, The man that doth theſe things ſhall live by them;</hi> when <hi>that righteouſneſs which is of faith,</hi> enquireth neither for new literal precepts to be received from <hi>Chriſt now in heaven,</hi> or for literal ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of the old Law, the which he fulfilled in his death: <hi>But what ſaith it? The word is nigh us,</hi> and every day preached; <hi>if thou ſhalt confeſs with thy mouth the Lord Jeſus, and ſhalt believe in thine heart that God raiſed him from the dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> And then for our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable outward obedience to Chriſt as King, as well as confeſſion he is our <hi>Lord,</hi> we have his own direction to hear ſuch as he ſhall from time to time delegate, when he ſaith, <hi>He that heareth you heareth me,</hi> and the like.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:55989:9"/>13. If we ſearch after the quality of theſe which were from time to time to be in this ſort <hi>heard<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and that according to thoſe ſeveral ſtates and conditions which man then ſtood in, in reſpect of thoſe different Covenants &amp; Diſpenſations he was under; it is to be conſidered, that as the will and affections of Mankind ſtood at firſt more ſimple and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupt, and their inward plantation of love more natural and entire, ſo had they again more immediate directions from God himſelf to guide them in ſuch things as they might occaſionally erre in. The innocencie of that firſt eſtate cauſing him more familiarly to converſe with the Patriar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>14. But after the Flood, and towards the promulgation of the Law, whenas Mankind grew worſe and worſe, he then by degrees withdrew ſuch manifeſtations only appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Angels, or the like; and reſolved that <hi>his Spirit ſhould not</hi> (ſo immediately) <hi>ſtrive with man</hi> in that kind; but to conſtitute others, who as his Vicegerents ſhould be obeyed in his ſtead. He would not take to himſelf ſuch perſonal Judgment in the acts of violence, as in the caſe of <hi>Abel,</hi> but remit the ſentencing of it here to be done in an appointed way, by man himſelf; <hi>Whoſoever ſheddeth mans blood, by man ſhall his blood be ſhed.</hi> In which receſs of his we muſt next ſuppoſe, that all things tending to the ends before rehearſed, that is, to the honor and worſhip of God, or preſervation and good of men, are now to be directed and guided by others; excepting only ſuch things as by expreſs Law from himſelf are to be obeyed and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged as unalterable by any other.</p>
               <p>15. If we look unto the way and kinde how this regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould be ſteered, in regard of perſons, it will be plain he never diſpenſed with this power to more then one at once in chief; not willing there ſhould be any more Gods in any Kingdom on Earth, then was in Heaven it ſelf. To this end it may be obſerved, that when-ever
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:55989:9"/>
God makes a promiſe to any perſon of a great increaſe of race and poſterity, he doth withal (as a compleating of that bleſſing) make them a promiſe of a Monarchical or Kingly government; and that moſt eſpecially to thoſe people of whom he will make his Church, and by whom he would have himſelf more eminently ſerved.

But the Scripture treating of Religious matters, applies that notion to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Meetings made to that end<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And therefore that Aſſembly which <hi>Demetrius</hi> and his <hi>Crafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> made, is called by that name. But then farther, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe to be called forth, muſt preſuppoſe ſome perſon or perſons having power ſo to do, and alſo to propound and regulate what ſhall be diſputed of or determined in theſe Aſſemblies; in that reſpect again we after find, that thoſe things which in the former unruly meeting could not be compoſed, are by the <hi>Town-Clark</hi> promiſed to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in a more lawful Church or aſſembly, to be called according to Authority. All Religions agreeing in this truth, that without obſervation of Government and Order, both Church and State will quickly run into confuſion.</p>
               <p>After Chriſtianity had a while been profeſſed, this name by way of excellence was appropriate to them, and thoſe of their communion: Inſomuch as in the beginning thereof,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:55989:10"/>
and while the Land of <hi>Jewry</hi> did contain the whole number of Believers, or that the Chriſtians there or elſwhere had not caſt themſelves into any proper or diſtinct forms of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment; all ſuch as ſtood as well ſeparated from the world, as aſſociated amongſt themſelves by their joint profeſſion of the ſame faith, ſtood only diſtinct from the reſt of the world by the word <hi>Church,</hi> or <hi>Church of Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Catholick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly applied, without diſtinction thereof into parts in reſpect of any local application<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But when afterwards they came to be diſperſed into ſeveral Cities, ſo diſtant from one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other in place, and ſo different in juriſdictions, as to require ſome form of Eccleſiaſtical diſcipline to be ſetled amongſt themſelves for their more orderly ſervice in their Religion; it came then to paſs, that as thoſe that had <hi>begotten them in the faith,</hi> and been their ſpiritual fathers and inſtructors, had chief authority herein, ſo were thoſe their Churches and followers diſtinguiſhed by topical additions, as the <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Saints</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> at <hi>Corinth,</hi> at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> or the like. By the uſe of the word <hi>at</hi> ſuch a place, and not ſaying, the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> of <hi>Corinth,</hi> of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> or the like, (as now we do the Church of <hi>Rome, England, Geneva,</hi> &amp;c) we are to conceive, that as the firſt Believers were, in reſpect of this ſeparation from the reſt of the world, in faith and ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious exerciſes, called by the name of a Church; ſo theſe, in thoſe ſeveral Cities wherein they lived, were called <hi>Saints</hi> or <hi>Church at</hi> ſuch a City, and not <hi>of;</hi> as betokening that they were aſwel but a part of that City as to civil regiment, as alſo a part of the whole Catholick Church now ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to ſome ſeparate Authority in the exerciſe of their Religion. But then we are to conceive, that although this ſeparation of theirs from others of the ſame City, both in their meetings and holy exerciſes; were done in order to their Religion; yet was it not the quality of any Religion, as ſuch a Religion, but difference in rites and form of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and in meeting thereabouts from that other Religion which was publikely authoriſed in that place, which made it preſerve this name of <hi>Church</hi> as taken in its proper ſenſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:55989:11"/>And therefore (as before ſaid) we ſhall uſually find that the Addition of the <hi>Church of God,</hi> or <hi>of Chriſt,</hi> is put to diſtinguiſh, as well as to dignifie it above other religious Congregations that were not ſuch. And upon this reaſon it is, that we never read in the Scripture, that the the word <hi>Church</hi> is applied to the <hi>Jews,</hi> although they were a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſeparate from all the reſt of the world, both in their Religion it ſelf, and in the Ceremonies thereof; even for that it was all one and the ſame with that which the publick Authority of that place did appoint and allow. Whereas when Chriſtianity firſt began amongſt them, the firſt Profeſſors thereof, being but ſubordinately divided, were ſet down as a Church or Congregation of men in that reſpect ſeparate, ſaying, <hi>The Church,</hi> or <hi>Church of Chriſt which is at Jeruſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which being conſidered, we need not wonder why S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould proceed to no higher puniſhment then that of Excommunication, againſt a <hi>Blasphemer,</hi> or an <hi>inceſtuous perſon,</hi> or the like, who (by the very heinouſneſs and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of their ſins) might be preſumed not greatly deſirous of their Communion; even for that it was, at that time, all the puniſhment he, or other Heads of Churches could inflict, wanting (as before noted) all coercive juriſdiction. Upon which ground again, we find not that the <hi>Jews</hi> did ever exerciſe this kind of puniſhment while they continued maſters of their own ſoveraignty; but, compriſing all offences under the ſame Law, they puniſhed tranſgreſſions of all ſorts as breaches thereof: when yet afterward in the time of our Saviour, that the ſupreme power was in the hand of the <hi>Romans,</hi> we find them both threatening, and actually thruſting men out of their Synagogues.</p>
               <p>But however ſuch notorious ſinners as thoſe might, in the infancie of Chriſtianity, ſet lightly of any Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſure in that kind; yet with the more conſcientious ſort, who, in regard of thoſe many promiſes by Chriſt made no his Church, had been at firſt won to be of their fellowſhip and communion as the only means to their ſalvation, it
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:55989:11"/>
was taken as a puniſhment of the higheſt import. And however that the then Church, for want of Judiciary power as aforeſaid, could not puniſh otherwiſe, yet ſince it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came all that were <hi>named by the name of Chriſt to depart from iniquity, and to have their converſation ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comed Saints, and to walk worthy that vocation wherewith they were called,</hi> (in which reſpect we ſhall find the name of <hi>Diſciples, Believers, Saints, Church,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently uſed to ſignifie thoſe that made profeſſion of Chriſts name) It therefore became them who were to be as <hi>lights on a hill,</hi> and to ſee that <hi>others light did ſo ſhine before men, that they ſeeing their good works might glorifie that God</hi> in whoſe obedience they did it, to be very ſenſible and tender of permitting any thing ſcandalous in the eye of the world, to be acted or countenanced by any of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</p>
               <p>In reference to which gracious promiſes of Salvation, Illumination, Aſſiſtance, and the like, made by Chriſt to his Church, and of that degree of ſanctity wherewith thoſe of this profeſſion ſtood eminent above the reſt of the world, or of that City or place where they lived; it is no wonder if we find that this notion of <hi>Church</hi> was ſtill uſed, even after the time that the publick Authority of the Country came alſo to be of the ſame belief; eſpecially conſidering that it was more then three hundred years after Chriſts birth before any Emperor at all was of that profeſſion, from which they quickly again fell; and that during the ſaid time, and a good while after, the more conſiderable, and perhaps the major part of the Empire it ſelf, (beſides what was done in other Countries more heatheniſh) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſtill Infidels. Towards whoſe converſion, and for the greater honor of their Maſter and his doctrine, as they deſired to become worthy Diſciples by the example of their holy lives, ſo d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d they withall ſtill keep up as far as might be a communion with one another therein, as well as a ſeparation from others that were not of the ſame belief. But yet we ſhall never find in Scripture, or Author of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:55989:12"/>
that was not prejudiced by particular adherence to ſome party, that theſe notions of <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Saints</hi> were uſed to ſeparate Chriſtians from Chriſtians, ſo as to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt others (eſpecially their fellow-ſubjects) that pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly profeſſed faith and obedience to Chriſt, to be yet none of his Church; until ſuch time as the whole Church, through the goodneſs of God, being rid of the fear of much harm from ſuch as for Chriſts ſake were their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon enemy, ſome ſeparate parts thereof began in a ſtrange requital to ſeek out enemies amongſt themſelves: Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, pride, intereſt, and paſſion cauſing men to forget thoſe prime precepts of <hi>humility, meekneſs, patience, brotherly love,</hi> and the like, wherewith Chriſtianity ſtood at firſt adorned, and whereby they (as out of a common principle of love to Chriſt and his honor, as well as to one another, according to the true intent of Religion) were piouſly and unanimouſly guided; and now to proſecute that courſe which ſhould at once hazard the honor and good of both Chriſt and his whole Church, through their ſtrife to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance ſome particular Sect above the reſt, and themſelves in it. As if Chriſts Diſciples and followers muſt not now be called ſuch in regard of their faith in him, as formerly was uſed; but out of belief in, and for following them rather in things circumſtantial, or by themſelves called fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental, the more to countenance that breach of Charity which muſt thence enſue: hereby ſhewing that we have not, <hi>as the true elect of God and beloved, put on bowels of mercies, kindneſſes, humbleneſs of mind, meekneſs, long-ſuffering;</hi> ſo as <hi>to forbear one another, and forgive one another, if any man have a quarrel againſt any,</hi> even as Chriſt forgave us: But have neglected to <hi>put on Charity, which is the bond of perfectneſs; and to let the peace of God rule in our hearts, to the which we are alſo called into one body,</hi> even this body and communion of a Church, <hi>Col. 3. 12, &amp;c.</hi> It being indeed impoſſible for any but ſuch <hi>elect</hi> as theſe to eſcape thoſe <hi>deceits</hi> and ſnares which each particular Sect, <hi>as in Chriſts name,</hi> will be ready to lay before us, ſaying, <hi>Lo here is
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:55989:12"/>
Chriſt, and lo there is Chriſt!</hi> on purpoſe to affright us from confidence in <hi>that Name whereby alone under heaven we can be ſaved;</hi> as if ſalvation were not to be found in being a Member of the Catholick Church, or any part of it, as Chriſtian; but in that <hi>ſecret Chamber,</hi> or that <hi>deſert Aſſembly,</hi> which is now ſeparately named and owned by themſelves.</p>
               <p>6. This is that great miſery under which Chriſtendom hath of late been ſo much troubled, as well through that ambitious humor of univerſal rule and dominion, whereby thoſe of the Roman party (out of opinion of Eminencie, Succeſſion, or the like) would advance their Head to be Head of the whole Church, (even where his juriſdiction reacheth not:) As of others alſo, who, in any particular Church, are ready to make a ſeparation of themſelves; as though, in regard of any extraordinary degree of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, of worſhip, or ſanctity of life by them profeſſed above others, the antient notion of <hi>Church</hi> could now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain be appropriate to them, without notice of their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of the ſame Religion, and thoſe in Authority, and perhaps more in number alſo; in like manner as formerly the notion of <hi>Church</hi> was underſtood in oppoſition to thoſe that were meer Heathens.</p>
               <p>7. The truth is, that Chriſtian ſocieties may well be diſtinguiſhed from Profeſſors of other Religions by this peculiar appellation; their Religion being indeed <hi>the</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, even as their God is apparently <hi>the</hi> God. For where they, in diſcovery of their meer humane extraction or worſ, are, in their precepts, wholly regardful of their own outward glory, pomp and eſtimation, and that according to humane fancie and opinion; when we are by voice from heaven taught that ſtrict conjunction which is between <hi>Glory to God in the higheſt!</hi> and <hi>Peace on earth, and good will towards men.</hi> Their Deities ſtand manifeſtly on their Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, profeſſing greateſt love to ſuch as are moſt zealous in them, or ſuch like kind of adoration: Ours pronounce <hi>Charity the end of the Law,</hi> and prefer <hi>Mercy before Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice;</hi>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:55989:13"/>
and, to encourage men thereto, our Saviour perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nateth the <hi>hungry, blind, naked, impriſoned,</hi> and promiſeth even the reward of Heaven to ſuch as ſhould moſt expreſs their love and duty to him that way.</p>
               <p>8. And thereupon again, as true it is, that particular Churches cannot ſeclude one another from being members of that Catholick body, while they acknowledged the ſame Common head; much leſs can ſuch as live within the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, or are members of any Chriſtian Church or ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, claim any juriſdiction apart, or make ſeparation therefrom, upon allegation of any extraordinary ſanctity or neerer degree of imploiment in Religious affairs; for this were to overthrow the main ſcope of the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſet down. And therefore ſince humane preſervation and Peace is the end of Religious as well as Civil aſſociati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it will therefore follow, that as each State hath its rule entire and abſolute, for the better preſervation of concord and order, ſo muſt each Chriſtian State or Church much more have the like, in as much as thoſe precepts and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections leading thereunto are much more apparently within their Commiſſion; their duty and charge being to perfect and conſummate that by a religious tie, unto which natural perfection could not reach.</p>
               <p>9. And hereby it comes to paſs, that what was vertue or vice in a bare Philoſophical accompt, is now called righteouſneſs or ſin. And ſo theſe Politick ſocieties, which; upon the former light of natural reaſon, took upon them the guidance of humane actions, and were called Kingdoms and Commonwealths, when they come to acknowledg ſubjection to this higher direction and rule, are uſually called Churches alſo. And thereupon thoſe that were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly called Schiſmaticks in reſpect of ſeparation, or ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornneſs to Eccleſiaſtick authority, are now to be eſteemed ſeditious and Rebels alſo, if they do in any ſuch thing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey or oppoſe him that hath both theſe authorities con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined. For very hard it would ſeem, if the ſame terms of ſeparation ſhould ſtill be kept up againſt Chriſtian Princes
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:55989:13"/>
and Rulers, as was formerly; and they allowed no more honor and power being Chriſtians, then while they were Pagans. But we will now proceed to ſhew what hath been the ſenſe of the Church of <hi>England</hi> herein, according to the doctrine of thoſe that were eminent in it.</p>
               <p>10. As thoſe of the Roman party had (no doubt) a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of ſtretching the Papal juriſdiction, even in tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, by their engroſſment of all ſpiritual power as Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick head, ſo hath it been always cenſured by ours as an unjuſt uſurpation: Therefore we ſhall find that the late <hi>Archbiſhop,</hi> in his Anſwer to the <hi>Jeſuite,</hi> all along to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove that claim of Univerſal head of the whole Church, and <hi>ſect. 25. num.</hi> 12. ſheweth, <q>That after the converſion of the Emperors, the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> themſelves were ſtill elected or confirmed by them, without any title of Univerſal head; until that <hi>John</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> having been countenanced in that title by <hi>Mauri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> the Emperor, (who came afterward to be depoſed and murthered by <hi>Phocas) Phocas</hi> conferred on <hi>Boniface</hi> the third that very honor, which two of his Predeceſſors had declaimed againſt as monſtrous and blaſphemous, if not Antichriſtian.</q> And as he thus defends the power and juriſdiction of particular Churches, and the chief Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate in them againſt the Pope, ſo doth he defend the power and ſupremacie of this Magiſtrate over all that live within the ſame juriſdiction: <q>And therefore <hi>ſect. 26. num.</hi> 9. doth ſet it down for a great and undoubted Rule given by <hi>Optatus; That whereſoever there is a Church, there the Church is in the Commonwealth, not the Commonwealth in the Church,</hi> and ſo alſo the Church was in the Roman Empire.</q> The truth is, that at firſt, and while ſome ſmaller parcels of the Roman Empire only were Chriſtians, then theſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being only of the Church, might it be ſaid to be in the Commonwealth; firſt as being but a part, and next but a ſubordinate part of the whole Empire, or thoſe that had juriſdictions therein: But after that the Government it ſelf became Chriſtian, then was there no queſtion to be
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:55989:14"/>
rightly made, which was in which? that is, whether the Church in the Commonwealth, or that in the Church: For that both were one, and both to be conceived inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded under that name of higheſt honor, the name of <hi>Church,</hi> importing as well our relation to God, as to one another. Whereupon alſo, ſince, for ſome Ages, the authority of the Roman Empire did extend it ſelf in a manner over all Nations that were Chriſtian, it might well come to paſs that, amongſt the Writers of thoſe times, the Roman and Catholick Church might be taken as equivalent and alike: which to uſe now, is an abſurd contradiction, as implying a <hi>particular-univerſal;</hi> for none other it is to call any man a Roman Catholick. At the time the Emperor of <hi>Rome</hi> had the ſoveraignty or government of any Chriſtian State, then and there had the Pope or chief Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> the like ſoveraignty in ordering of the affairs of that Church, if the ſaid Emperor ſo thought fit; and to depart from that obedience or communion, was then (as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) not Schiſm alone, but Sedition alſo. But in caſe any that are neither within the Popes own territory nor juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, but in the proper juriſdiction of ſome other Prince, who yields only a voluntary conformity in doctrine and diſcipline to that Sea, as <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and other free Princes now do; then are they that make alteration a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the liking of that Prince or Power under whom they live, not Schiſmaticks againſt the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> but againſt him; and if he approve of their doctrine, they are neither Schiſmaticks, nor Seditious: As was the caſe of our <hi>Henry</hi> the Eight, and thoſe his Subjects of the Church of <hi>England</hi> which followed him; and for ought I know, was the case of <hi>Luther</hi> alſo, in reſpect of his ſubjection to the Duke of <hi>Saxony.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>11: For it is to be conſidered, that where the Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction doth divide and become independent, there doth the notion of Church divide alſo; as was to be ſeen in the Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> after they fell into two diſtinct
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:55989:14"/>
Governments, to wit, that of <hi>Judah,</hi> and that of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> In which caſe although they had ſtill but one divine Law and preſcript form of Worſhip to live by, yet the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of each Kingdom being unſubordinate, they were each of them reckoned as a Church apart, and the good or ill Government of each of them attributed to none but the peculiar King thereof, even as proceeding from his proper obſervance or breach of the Law. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Primitive Churches in Saint <hi>Johns</hi> time had not yet any abſolute Juriſdiction, yet ſince what they had was independent, we ſhall find that thoſe Reproofs and Admonitions which were in the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> given to the <hi>ſeven Churches,</hi> are directed to their ſeveral <hi>Angels</hi> or Heads, apart, without any hint or notice of ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to any other Catholick Head or Curate, ſave of CHRIST himſelf.</p>
               <p>12. I muſt confeſs, that as the earneſt deſire and aim I have always had towards the ſilencing of diſputes and civil commotions in Kingdoms, hath made me the more earneſt and ſtudious in preſſing the power and authority of each Prince; ſo for common-peace ſake again amongſt Kings themſelves, and for taking off thoſe irregularities and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions which each of them, by this power, might inflict on their Subjects, I have many times entertained the thoughts of admittance of ſome ſuch power like that claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Biſhop of <hi>Rome:</hi> But upon ſerious excogitation of the whole, I was brought to reſolve, that in the plea and condition of power the Pope now ſtandeth, the interpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his authority would many times rather increaſe, then be effectual to prevent injuſtice, or ſilence differences; whether acted between a Prince and his own Subjects, or by one Prince upon another. As for example; ſome perſon or order of Princes ſubjects, miſliking their uſage, appeal to <hi>Rome,</hi> as againſt injuſtice and oppreſſion: He muſt then (to make his authority known to be uſeful) determine for one party or another, as his judgment ſhall be engaged.

If for the King, then is he but heightned and farther warranted to do the like: If for <hi>Thomas a Becket,</hi> or the Barons againſt him, as ſometimes in <hi>England,</hi> then are Subjects encouraged towards ſedition and civil war another time. Again, before he can be ſuppoſed rightly to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe between Prince and Prince in the juſtice of their quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, they muſt all of them be brought to be of the ſame religion and perſwaſion with himſelf, or elſe equally averſe, that he may be impartial. Suppoſe that might be done, yet ſince he may have kindred and relations, may he not in that caſe favor a Nephew, a <hi>Caſar Borgia,</hi> or the like, againſt him that hath no relation? or may he not reſpect intereſt and application, ſo as again to favor ſuch an one as King <hi>John,</hi> not only above his Barons, but other Princes too, upon reſignation of his Crown to be held of him and his ſucceſſors. But that was not all; for partiality, and the like, is but that which the Subjects of any Monarch might object againſt his abſolute rule: But the great difference and difficulty is, that ſince the abſolute Monarch was in all cauſes and over all perſons in his dominions ſupreme Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, there was hereby a ſure way for prevention of civil war and diſturbance; which, being the chief political evil, would recompence thoſe ſufferings of inferior nature, which could but occaſionally happen, and never be ſo general. Whereas he claiming but Eccleſiaſtical power only, and it being not at all determined or agreed upon what is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo, or not ſo, (for prevention of queſtion thereabouts) I ſaw no poſſible hope to attain peace by his umpirage, (if any ſhould ſay he did exceed his Commiſſion) unleſs he could make himſelf Judg of that too, and ſo by degrees, and <hi>in ordine ad ſpiritualia,</hi> draw in cogniſance of all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters whatſoever. When that is done, as <hi>Conſtantines</hi> Throne will better become him then S. <hi>Peters</hi> Chair; ſo truly if ſuch an Univerſal Chriſtian Monarch there were, (which is not likely to fall to be he) there might much good ariſe by it, as to the general increaſe of Chriſtian peace and profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

In the mean time, the uſurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed exerciſe of this his Eccleſiaſtick power, where he had no juriſdiction, as a power ſtanding inſubordinate to the Prince, hath begotten that great miſtake, That there might be a Church in a Church, that is, one Chriſtian Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth in another.</p>
               <p>13. But let us hear judicious Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> more at large in this buſineſs of the Church, and in anſwer to ſuch as would appropriate the notion of Church to thoſe of their own perſwaſion only, <hi>(lib. 5. fol. 367.)</hi>

Seeing then that the <hi>Church</hi> is a name which Art hath given to Profeſſors of true Religion; as they which will define a man, are to paſs
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:55989:16"/>
by thoſe qualities wherein one man doth excel another, and to take only thoſe eſſential properties whereby a man doth differ from creatures of other kinds: So he that will teach what the Church is, ſhall never rightly perform the work whereabout he goeth, till, in matter of Religion, he touch that difference which ſevereth the Churches religion from theirs who are not of the Church. Religion being therefore a matter partly of contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, partly of action, we muſt define the Church, which is a religious ſociety, by ſuch differences as do properly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the eſſence of ſuch things; that is to ſay, by the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject or matter whereabout the contemplations and actions of the Church are properly converſant: For ſo all Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges and all Vertues are defined. Whereupon, becauſe the only object which ſeparateth ours from other Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, is <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> in whom none but the Church doth believe, and whom none but the Church doth worſhip; we find that accordingly the Apoſtles do every where diſtinguiſh hereby the Church from Infidels and from Jews; accounting them which call upon the name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to be his Church. If we go lower, we ſhall but add unto this certain caſual and variable acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents which are not properly of the being, but make only for the happier and better being of the Church of God, either indeed, or in mens opinions and conceits. This is the error of all Popiſh definitions that hitherto have been brought: They define not the Church by that which the Church eſſentially is, but by that wherein they imagine their own more perfect then the reſt are. Touching parts of eminencie and perfection, parts likewiſe of imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and defect in the Church of God, they are infinite, their degrees and differences no way poſſible to be drawn unto any certain account. There is not the leaſt conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and variance, but it blemiſheth ſomwhat the unity that ought to be in the Church of Chriſt; which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding may have not only, without loſs of eſſence or breach of concord, her manifold varieties in Rites and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:55989:16"/>
Ceremonies of Religion, but alſo her ſtrifes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions many times, and that about matters of no ſmall importance; yea, her ſchiſms, factions, and ſuch other evils whereunto the body of the Church is ſubject, ſound and ſick remaining both of the ſame body, as long as both parts retain, by outward profeſſion, that vital ſubſtance of Truth, which maketh Chriſtian Religion to differ from theirs which acknowledg not our Lord Jeſus Chriſt the bleſſed Saviour of mankind, give no credit to his glorious Goſpel, and have his Sacraments, the ſeal of eternal life, in deriſion. Now the priviledg of the viſible Church of God (for of that we ſpeak) is to be herein like the Ark of <hi>Noah;</hi> for any thing we know to the contrary, all without are loſt ſheep. Yet in this was the Ark of <hi>Noah</hi> priviledged above the Church; that whereas none of them which were in the one could periſh, numbers in the other are caſt away, becauſe to eternal life our profeſſion is not enough. Many things exclude from the Kingdom of God, although from the Church they ſeparate not. In the Church there ariſe ſundry grievous ſtorms, by means whereof whole Kingdoms and Nations profeſſing Chriſt, both have been heretofore, and are at this preſent day divided about Chriſt. During which diviſion and contentions amongſt men, albeit each part do juſtifie it ſelf, yet the one of neceſſity muſt needs erre, if there be any contradiction between them, be it great or little: And what ſide ſoever it be that hath the truth, the ſame we muſt alſo acknowledg alone to hold <hi>with the true Church in that point,</hi> and conſequently reject the other as an enemy, <hi>in that caſe, fallen away from the true Church.</hi> Wherefore of hypocrites and diſſemblers, whoſe profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion at the firſt was but only from the teeth outward, when they afterwards took occaſion to oppugn certain principal Articles of Faith, the Apoſtles which defended the truth againſt them, pronounce them gone out from the fellowſhip of ſound and ſincere Believers, when as yet the Chriſtian religion they had not utterly caſt off.

Both Hereſie and many other crimes which wholly ſever from God, do ſever from the Church of God in part only. The myſterie of Piety, ſaith the Apoſtle, is without peradventure great: <hi>GOD hath been manifeſted in the fleſh, hath been juſtified in the Spirit, hath been ſeen of Angels, hath been preached to Nations, hath been believed on in the world, hath been taken up into glory.</hi> The Church a pillar and foundatiou of this truth, which no where is known or profeſs'd but only within the Church, and they all of the Church that profeſs it. In the mean while it cannot be denied, that many profeſs this, who are not therfore cleered ſimply from all either faults or errors, which maketh ſeparation between us and the Wel-ſpring of our happineſs. Idolatry ſevered of old the <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> Iniquity, thoſe Scribes and Phariſees from God, who notwithſtanding were a part of the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> a part of that very ſeed which God did himſelf acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg to be his Church. The Church of God may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore contain both them which indeed are not his, yet muſt be reputed his by us, that know not their inward thoughts; and them, whoſe apparent wickedneſs teſtifieth even in the ſight of the whole world, that God abhorreth them. For to this, and no other purpoſe, are meant thoſe Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles which our Saviour in the Goſpel hath concerning mixture of Vice with Vertue, Light with Darkneſs, Truth with Error; as well an openly known and ſeen, as a cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly cloaked mixture. That which therefore ſeparateth utterly, that which cutteth off clean from the viſible Church of Chriſt, is plain Apoſtacie, direct denial, utter rejection of the whole Chriſtian faith, as far as the ſame is profeſſedly different from Infidelity. Hereticks, as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe points of Doctrine wherein they fail: Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, as touching the quarrels for which, or the duties wherein they divide themſelves from their brethren:

Looſe, licentious, and wicked perſons, as touching their ſeveral offences and crimes, have all forſaken the true Church of God, the Church which is ſound and ſincere in the doctrine that they corrupt, the Church that keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the bond of unity which they violate, the Church which walketh in the ways of righteouſneſs which they tranſgreſs; the very true Church of Chriſt they have left, howbeit not altogether left nor forſaken ſimply the Church, upon the main foundations whereof they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue built, notwithſtanding thoſe breaches whereby they are rent from bottom to top aſunder.</q>

               <p>And having largely diſcourſed on the ſame argument in the beginning of his third Book, he proceeds to reprove ſuch, as being then members of this Church, would anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilate her being truly a Church, and claim an indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie becauſe of ſome corruptions they conceived in her. <q>As there are (ſaith he, <hi>fol.</hi> 86.) which make the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> utterly no Church at all, by reaſon of ſo many grievous errors in their Doctrine; ſo we have them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, who under pretence of imagined corruptions in our Diſcipline, do give even as hard a judgment of the Church of <hi>England</hi> it ſelf.</q> And afterwards, <hi>f.</hi> 88. coming to diſtinguiſh the viſible Church into parts according to their ſeveral juriſdictions, to the end that authority there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of might be made uſeful, he farther ſaith: <q>For preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Chriſtianity, there is not any thing more need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, then that ſuch as are of the viſible Church have mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual felowſhip and ſociety one with another. In which conſideration, as in the main body of the Sea being one, yet within divers precincts hath divers names; ſo the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church is in like ſort divided into a number of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct ſocieties, every of which is termed a Church within it ſelf. In this ſenſe the Church is always a viſible ſociety of men; not an Aſſembly, but a ſociety. For although the name of the Church be given unto Chriſtian aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, although any multitude of Chriſtian men congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated may be termed by the name of a Church; yet Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:55989:18"/>
properly are rather things that belong to a Church. Men are aſſembled for performance of publike actions, which actions being ended, the Aſſembly diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth it ſelf, and is no longer in being; whereas the Church which was aſſembled, doth no leſs continue afterwards then before. Where but three are, and they of the Laity alſo, ſaith <hi>Tertullian,</hi> yet there is a Church, that is to ſay, a Chriſtian Aſſembly. But a Church, as now we are to underſtand it, is a Society, that is, a number of men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing unto ſome Chriſtian fellowſhip, the place and limits whereof are certain. That wherein they have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, is the publike exerciſe of ſuch duties as thoſe men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Apoſtles <hi>Acts,</hi> Inſtruction, Breaking of bread, Prayers. As therefore they that are of the myſtical body of Chriſt, have thoſe inward graces and vertues, whereby they differ from all others which are not of the ſame body; even ſo again, whoſoever appertain to the viſible body of the Church, they have alſo the notes of external profeſſion, whereby the world knoweth what they are. After the ſame manner, even the ſeveral Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties of Chriſtian men, unto every of which the name of a Church is given with addition betokening ſeveralty, as the Church of <hi>Rome, Corinth, Epheſus, England,</hi> and ſo the reſt, muſt be endued with coreſpondent general properties belonging unto them, as they are publike Chriſtian ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties. And of ſuch properties common unto all ſocieties Chriſtian, it may not be denied, that one of the very chiefeſt is Eccleſiaſtical Politie. Which word I therefore the rather uſe, becauſe the name of Government, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly men underſtand it in ordinary ſpeech, doth not compriſe the largeneſs of that whereunto in this queſtion it is applied: For when we ſpeak of Government, what doth the greateſt part conceive thereby, but only the exerciſe of ſuperiority peculiar unto Rulers and Guides of others? To our purpoſe therefore the name of <hi>Church-Politie</hi> will better ſerve, becauſe it containeth both Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and alſo whatſoever beſides belongeth to the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:55989:18"/>
ordering of the Church in publike. Neither is any thing in this degree more neceſſary then Church-Politie, which is a form of ordering the publike ſpiritual affairs of the Church of God. But we muſt note, that he which affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Speech to be neceſſary amongſt all men throughout the world, doth not thereby import that all men muſt neceſſarily ſpeak one kind of language: Even ſo the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Politie and Regiment in all Churches may be held, without holding any one certain Form to be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary in them all, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>15. From all which diſcourſe theſe Concluſions are plainly deducible, as touching the preſervation of Peace and Charity. Firſt, that the imputation of Hereſie, Schiſm, or the like, cannot by particular Churches be ſo charged upon one another, as to take from them the reality of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing true Chriſtian Churches, whilſt they hold the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And much leſs, that any ſuch imputation from any the ſons or members of any Church ſhould be held of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail to take that reſpect which is due unto her as a Church of Chriſt, and debar her from exerciſing his authority on earth; and that not only for keeping of love and union, but <hi>for preſervation of Chriſtianity</hi> it ſelf, which is alſo needful to be upheld by obſervation of the Rules of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety and Government in the Church, as well as in the Commonwealth.</p>
               <p>16. That to a Church, as now the word is applied<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Polity and Regiment being proper, that therefore no ſort of perſons wanting this power, but living under it or any other Chriſtian juriſdiction, can aſſume to themſelves the notion of a Church, although they ſhould conſiſt of ſuch as were of the order of the Clergy. In which condition, ſince the notion of Church could be no otherwiſe appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate then to import a Congregation or Aſſembly, it might be given to the Laity alſo, as he avoucheth out of <hi>Tertullian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>17. And next we may obſerve what thoſe things be that are to be publikely exerciſed, and wherein the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:55989:19"/>
of each Church are to have communion, and which do fall within the Churches authority and cogniſance, as <hi>Inſtruction, Breaking of bread,</hi> and <hi>Prayers;</hi> that is to ſay, to order and regulate the publike uſe of Preaching, Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of Sacraments, of Prayers, or other form of Service or Worſhip. So that when any Church ſhall think fit to make any new appointment in any thing of theſe kinds, <hi>It is not fit</hi> (as he elſwhere ſaith) <hi>for thoſe that are members thereof, to ask why we hang our judgments on the Churches ſleeve?</hi> and out of ſtubbornneſs and diſreſpect to her authority, to go about to perſwade men to inconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity; by making them believe, that obedience to alteration in theſe things is hazardous or deſtructive to their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: Not regarding the difference which ought to be put between things of the one and the other ſort, in reſpect of power to change. <q>Touching points of Doctrine (ſaith he, <hi>lib. 3. fol.</hi> 110, 111.) as for example, The <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of God,</hi> the <hi>Trinity of Perſons, Salvation by Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the body, Life everlaſting,</hi> the <hi>Judgment to come,</hi> and ſuch like; they have been, ſince the firſt hour that there was a Church in the world, and till the laſt they muſt be believed. But as for matters of Regiment, they are, for the moſt part, of another nature. To make new Articles of Faith and Doctrine, no man thiuketh it lawful: New Laws of Government, what Commonwealth or Church is there which maketh not, either at one time or another? <hi>The rule of Faith,</hi> ſaith <hi>Tertullian, is but one, and that alone immoveable, and impoſſible to be framed or caſt anew.</hi> The Law of outward Order and Politie, not ſo. There is no reaſon in the world wherefore we ſhould eſteem it as neceſſary always to do, as always to believe the ſame things; ſeeing every man knoweth that the matter of Faith is conſtant, the matter contrariwiſe of Actions daily changeable, eſpecially the matter of action belonging unto Church-Politie. Neither can I find that men of ſoundeſt judgments have any otherwiſe taught. then that Articles of belief, and things which all men muſt
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:55989:19"/>
of neceſſity do to the end they may be ſaved, are either expreſly ſet down in the Scripture, or elſe plainly thereby to be gathered. But touching things which belong to Diſcipline and outward Politie, the Church hath autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to make Canons, Laws and Decrees, even as we read in the Apoſtles times it did. Which kind of Laws (for as much as they are not in themſelves neceſſary to ſalvation) may, after they are made, be alſo changed, as the difference of times or places ſhall require.</q>
               </p>
               <p>18. So that then we may reſolve, that as the true eſſence of a Church (as a Church) doth depend on the doctrine and profeſſion of the faith of Jeſus Chriſt, and the authority from him received; ſo doth the eſſence and force of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline and outward Polity depend on her authority only. It is from her power, as a Church, that they are made of this or that form: It is not from any form in them, as thus or thus made, that her being or power can be thought to depend.</p>
               <p>19. And therefore ſurely if the Church have power to alter and change when they are made, as well as to make <hi>Canons, Laws,</hi> and <hi>Decrees;</hi> it muſt follow, that thoſe that are members of that Church, are alſo tied to obedience, Clergy as well as others; as he (<hi>lib<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5. fol.</hi> 391.) urgeth againſt the Non-conforming Miniſters of thoſe times, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>Why oppoſe they the name of a Miniſter in this caſe unto the ſtate of a private man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> do their Orders exempt them from obedience to Laws? That which their office and place requireth, is to ſhew themſelves Patterns of reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend ſubjection, not Authors and Maſters of contempt towards Ordinances; the ſtrength whereof when they ſeek to weaken, they do but in truth diſcover to the world their own imbecilities, which a great deal wiſelier they might conceal.</q> So that we may find that he is no ways countenancing thoſe that think their Orders do exempt them from the common relation of ſubjection, as if they had Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> power apart: But he is very preciſe and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory in reproof of ſuch as, in thoſe times, thought
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:55989:20"/>
they might oppoſe the Ordinances of their then Church-Governors, upon the ſcore of their Function. As if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had (as they ſaid) received their Commiſſion and authority to preach, to adminiſter, and the like, from God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that therefore in the manner, order, and other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances how they ſhould be performed, they ſhould not be tied to the conſtitutions of men, farther then they were agreeable to the Word of God; even in ſuch ſtrict ſenſe agreeable, as to find expreſs Texts for them; if not, their being agreeable to the general ſenſe and ſcope there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, would not (as they taught) ſuffice to conform their obedience, when as yet they could bring no Text in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof of them. No, if they wanted this, then they would (as he ſaid elſwhere) <hi>make their childiſh appeals</hi> to the uſage of other Churches which had no authority over them at all. And therefore I ſee not how any of that Order now can turn Non-conformiſts to our publick Communion, when (on the one hand) they cannot ſo much as pretend there is any thing retained not agreeable to the Word of God, and (on the other) they cannot alleadg the example of any one Church now in being, whoſe practiſe is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to them in thoſe things wherein they do diſſent. Theſe, I am ſure, may be juſtly accompted guilty of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacie from thoſe Principles formerly maintained by the famous and Orthodox men of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> rather then ſuch as will not, through private diſcontent and diſlike of perſons commanding and in power, ſhew ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornneſs to the command and power it ſelf. The which when it is by any done, is ſo far from giving any reputation to them, as men of Orders, Learning, or Gravity, that it <hi>doth but diſcover to the world their own imbecility,</hi> (in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of ſome peeviſh prejudice whereby they are ſwayed) <hi>which a great deal wiſelier they might conceal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>20. And becauſe, in theſe caſes again, it is not to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed otherwiſe now then amongſt Nonconformiſts for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, that is, that ſome having their neceſſities and wants greater, or being more fearful and conſcientious in open

oppoſition, are ready outwardly to yield to compliance, and yet do underhand deprave and diſcountenance the deed it ſelf, and that Authority which they do obey therein. Of theſe he ſaith, <hi>lib. 5. fol.</hi> 248. <q>

               <p>23. For if in thoſe things wherein controverſie is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be warranted by Scripture, or by the Catholick Church, as Fathers, Councels, or the like, ſuch as live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any Chriſtian authority ſhould take upon them to be judges, they ſhould then uſurpe that proper cogniſance and power which is peculiar to the Church onely; and leave her nothing to doe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For ſince in points fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, or fully agreed upon, her power reacheth not, it muſt follow, that to her alone it belongeth, out of that variety of interpretation made of the meaning of the Texts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and out of that variety and contradiction which is found amongſt Councels, Fathers, and other Writers, to make choice of, and give determination for what ſort of doctrine or regiment ſhe ſhall finde, either to have been moſt Catholiquely received, or to be grounded upon moſt Orthodox Principles, and ſoundeſt reaſon: Which done, for men to ſay the Church hath no power to inſtitute, or or take away, contrary to the Word of God, and then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce no other Texts for condemning her in any particular, then what are by others interpreted otherwiſe, and alſo after the ſame manner ſhe hath done already, doth certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly argue great arrogance, and ſtubbornneſs of mind, in them that would thus apply it, although the ſpeech in it ſelf be moſt true.</p>
               <p>24. And no leſſe then ſo it is, when out of the Sentences of ſome Councels, Fathers, or other Writers, the doctrine and authority of the Catholike Church is alledged, to take off our obedience to that Church under which we live:
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:55989:22"/>
It being none other in points of controverſie in Religion; then if in Civill ſuits and debates, the parties in contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould appeal from the Laws of that Common wealth, to the Verdict of the <hi>Civil Law,</hi> and avouch the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lpian, Papinian,</hi> or the like, for the meaning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: Or to the <hi>Law of</hi> Nations, and then prove there is ſuch a Law, and to be juſt ſo conſtrued, becauſe ſome men whom they eſteem well of, have ſo thought. If there be no controverſie about the truth or equity of what they propound, but all men are found to agree; why then it is a ſign God did make the diſcovery to them, ſince he hath thus enabled them to prove it: If not, how can they think but reaſonable, even for peace and order ſake, if not for her own ſake, that that ſide and determination which in this controverſie agrees with the Church, ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to that which is choſen by them. And therefore if the Church may deviſe new Rites, and muſt for Peace ſake be obeyed, then certainly when ſhe doth not deviſe any thing new, (by way of addition) nor ſo much as retain what was before taken as ſcandalous in things that were ancient, I do not ſee any <hi>invincible reaſon,</hi> no nor reaſon at all for Schiſme or ſeparation.</p>
               <p>25. And as for that <hi>power of mitigation what the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and literal rigour of Eccleſiaſticall Laws hath ſet down,</hi> as he ſpake it in juſtification of what was by the then Civill Magiſtrate, (or a power from her) diſpenſed with in the caſes of <hi>Plurality, Non-reſidence,</hi> and the like; ſo it may alſo truly inform us, that if for the further enabling men in the ſtudy of Divinity, and conſequently in the gift of preaching, (nay even for their temporal maintenance ſake) theſe general Laws and Rules of the Church were diſpenſed with while the ſame was ſtill remaining and in power. Much more may men now, (out of the rule of juſtice, and charity, both to themſelves and others) think themſelves diſpenſed with the omiſſion of ſome Rites and Ceremonies, and of reading the Service Book, when as, not a diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on alone, but a ſtrict injunction againſt the uſe of them is
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:55989:22"/>
by the like ſoveraign power apparantly made; and that Church alſo whoſe Laws they were, hath neither force or being. Charity I ſay, both publike and private, when as both preaching it ſelf, and the maintenance to riſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, have ſo neceſſary a dependance on the forbearance of them. If Preachers that had other places to live on, and preach in, might out of particular favour to them, or ſome other perſon whoſe Chaplains they were, be thus diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with, as we know they were, and that they then rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily enough made uſe of it; may we not conclude that both the rule of Charity to ones ſelf, and of generall chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to others (that may reap good by their Doctrine) will excuſe them, in a time when their own maintenance, and the exerciſe of preaching, doth wholly rely upon their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in this kinde? So that ſeem the thing never ſo ſtrange and new, either in reſpect of addition, or ſubſtraction, to what was formerly done and eſtabliſhed, it is not by thoſe that are Members, and do live within the jurisdiction there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to be diſobeyed, as out of ſcandal at alteration: the Church having power, as well to ſubſtract as to inſtitute; And therefore he ſaith, <hi>lib. 5. fol. 196.</hi> 
                  <q>
                     <hi>All things cannot be of ancient continuance, which are expedient and needfull for the ordering of ſpiritual affairs: But the Church being a body which dieth not, hath alwayes power as occaſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, no leſſe to ordain that which never was, then to ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie what hath been before. To preſcribe the order of doing all things, is a peculiar prerogative which wiſdome hath as Queen or Soveraign Commandreſs over other vertues.</hi> This in every ſeveral mans actions of common life, apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth unto Morall, in publike and politick ſecular affairs unto civill Wiſedom. In like manner to deviſe any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain form for the outward adminiſtration of publique duties in the ſervice of God, or things belonging there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, and to find out the moſt convenient rule for that uſe, is a point of wiſedome Eccleſiaſticall. It is not for a man which doth know, or ſhould know, what order is, and what peaceable government requireth; to ask why
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:55989:23"/>
we ſhould hang our judgement upon the Churches ſleeve? and why in matters of Order, more then in matters of Doctrine; The Church hath Authority to eſtabliſh that for an Order at one time, which at another time it may aboliſh, and in both do well.</q> Then which nothing could in my opinion, have been ſpoken more pointing to Peace, and ſilencing of diſputes in our preſent alterations, and to the ſatisfaction of ſuch as think that thoſe forms of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and adminiſtration of Sacraments, Ordination, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther publike Rites and Ceremonies may not by a ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Church and Power therein be lawfully taken away, like as they were by a former eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p>26. And that ſpecially, if to thoſe that have the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of theſe things, there ſhall ſeem to be ſuperſtition in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to the uſe of them, through ſome over-value and miſtake, which through frequent uſe, might be caſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them; as though they were indeed Fundamentals of themſelves. <q>
                     <hi>Superſtition</hi> (ſaith he, <hi>lib. 5. fol. 191.) ſuch as that of the Phariſees,</hi> by whom divine things indeed were leſſe, becauſe other things were more divinely eſteemed of then reaſon would. The Superſtition that riſeth vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary and by degrees, which are hardly diſcerned, ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it ſelf with the Rites even of every divine ſervice done to the onely true God, muſt be conſidered of, as a creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and incroaching evill; an evill, the beginnings where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are commonly harmleſſe: So that it proveth onely then to be an evill, when ſome farther accident doth grow unto it, or it ſelf come unto further growth; for in the Church of God ſometimes it cometh to paſſe, as in over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>battle grounds, the fertile diſpoſition whereof is good; yet becauſe it exceedeth due proportion, it bringeth forth abundantly, through too much rankneſſe, things leſſe profitable; whereby that which principally it ſhould yeeld, being either prevented in place, or defrauded of nouriſhment faileth. This (if ſo large a diſcourſe were neceſſary) might be exemplified by heaps of Rites and Cuſtomes, now ſuperſtitious in the greateſt part of the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:55989:23"/>
Chriſtian world, which in their firſt originall beginnings, when the ſtrength of vertuous, devout, or charitable af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection bloomed them, no man could juſtly have <hi>condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them as evill:</hi>
                  </q> whereby it is ſtill plain that things good and profitable in their firſt inſtitution, and ſetled upon good advice and great authority, may by a ſucceeding age and Church be found prejudiciall, and that then that Church hath power to take away and aboliſh that which the other did inſtitute<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>27. And again, much to the ſame purpoſe, and in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to ſuch as think things once well and ſolemnly eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, cannot be altered, he ſaith, <hi>l. 4. fol. 165.</hi> 
                  <q>
                     <hi>True it is,</hi> that neither Councels, nor Cuſtomes, be they never ſo ancient and ſo general, can let the Church from taking away that thing which is hurtful to be retained. Where things have been inſtituted, which being convenient and good at the firſt, do afterward in proceſſe of time wax otherwiſe; we make no doubt but they may be altered, yea, though Councels or Cuſtomes General have received them. And therefore it is but a needleſs kind of oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which they make who thus diſpute. If in thoſe things which are not expreſſed in the Scripture, that is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved of the Church, which is the cuſtome of the people of God, and decree of our Forefathers, then how can theſe things at any time be varied, which heretofore have been once ordained in ſuch ſort? Whereto we ſay, that things ſo ordained are to be kept, howbeit not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily any longer then till there grow any urgent cauſe to ordain the contrary. For there is not any poſitive Law of men, whether it be general or particular, received by former expreſſe conſent, as in Councels; or by ſecret ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, as in Cuſtoms it cometh to paſſe, but the ſame may be taken away, if occaſion ſerve. Even as we all know, that many things kept generally heretofore, are now in like <hi>ſort generally unkept, and aboliſhed every where.</hi>
                  </q> By which we may further finde, that as it is the duty of the Members of any Church to conform to ſuch Rights and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:55989:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Orders as the Authority thereof ſhall inſtitute and ſet up; ſo alſo can no plea of former eſtabliſhment, whether by Councels or Cuſtomes, warrant their oppoſition or incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, if the Church under which they live ſhall think fit to abrogate them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when they find urgent cauſe to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. No he accounts <hi>it but a needleſs kinde of oppoſition to urge in theſe diſputes,</hi> the cuſtome of the people of God, or the decree of our Fore-fathers; as if for the neceſſary continuance of Peace and Order, there were not the ſame degree of reſpect due to a ſucceeding Church, by her preſent children, as was given to the former Church, and ſuch as were our Forefathers therein. Can we fancie that the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment we doe now approve might be made in place of what the Church preceding it had made before, and yet think the Church under which we live cannot do the like, in diſanulling ſome things made by the Church preceding us.</p>
               <p>28. But now if all this while, it ſhould be allowed that this power ſhould be in the Church; yet what and if ſome mens greater affection and intereſt caſt towards other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons then thoſe that had the preſent managing of Religious affairs, might make them conjecture that rather they then theſe ought in theſe things to be obeyed; and what and if they might withall doubt, that him they called the Civill Magiſtrate ſhould have power to order affairs of the Church as head thereof; we will therefore ſet down what he farther inferreth, <hi>fol.</hi> 567. <q>
                     <hi>The Lord God of Iſrael</hi> hath given the kingdom over <hi>Iſrael</hi> to <hi>David</hi> for ever, even to him and his ſons, by a Covenant of Salt.</q> And <hi>Job</hi> 56. 8. bringing in that place of <hi>Cant. 8. 11.

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:55989:24"/>
are in governing of the flock of Chriſt, whomſoever the Holy Ghoſt hath ſet over them to go before them, and lead them in their ſeveral paſtures, one in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, another in that; As it is written, <hi>Take heed to your ſelves, and to all the flock, whereof the Holy Ghoſt hath made you overſeers, to feed the Church of God which he hath purchaſed with his own blood.</hi>
                  </q> And preſently after to ſhew who he means by thoſe <hi>Overſeers,</hi> he ſaith, <q>The Pope hath fawned upon the Kings and Princes of the earth, and by ſpiritual couzenage hath made them ſell their lawful Authorities and Jurisdictions for titles of <hi>Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Chriſtianiſſimus, Defenſor fidei,</hi> and ſuch like.</q> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain <hi>fol.</hi> 569. complaining of the unnatural uſage of ſome towards their Mother, that were natural children of this Church, under a miſguided conceit that Obedience was not due to the then Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> but to another; he ſaith, <q>That by this means the bowels of the child, may be made the mothers grave, and that it hath cauſed no ſmall number of our brethen to forſake their native Country, and with all diſloyalty to caſt off the yoke of their allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to our dread Soveraign whom God in mercy hath ſet over them; for whoſe ſafeguard, if they carried not the hearts of Tygers in the boſomes of men, they would think the deareſt blood in their bodies well ſpent;</q> and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after he reckons up the faults charged by the Popiſh party upon them, and for which they ſtood excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as if they had been no Church, nor part thereof: <hi>Viz.</hi>

Now, to my thinking we are again fallen into that unhappy condition, as to have the ſame, or much like faults and ſcandals laid to the charge as well of thoſe that are in Soveraign power, as of thoſe that follow them by ſuch as out of like zeal to former publike uſage and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are ready upon the ſame arguments to turn Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants to the preſent Orders of this Church; and yet to continue Recuſants to the Popiſh Communion too.

               <p>And leaſt any ſhould object (like them) nullity and invalidity to our Church or her authority, through ſome ſcruple of the lawfulneſſe and calling of our preſent Paſtors and Miniſters in the exerciſe of their Functions, becauſe of the want of ſome Forms and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies heretofore appointed to be uſed in their Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before they were permitted to preach, or adminiſter, and conſequently think it unlawfull to hear or receive at their hands, we ſhall finde him of another minde; nay though they were not at all in Orders, or claimed any miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from Authority: For he ſaith, <hi>lib. 5. fol</hi> 227. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as much as poſſible inclineth to validities and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, diſſolutions, and nullities of things done, are not onely not ſavoured, but hated; when either urged with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe, or extended beyond their reach: If therefore at any time it come to paſſe, <q>that in teaching publiquely or privately in delivering this bleſſed Sacrament of rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, ſome unſanctified hand, contrary to Chriſts ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Ordinances, do intrude it ſelf to others, which of theſe two Opinions ſeem more agreeable with equity,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:55989:25"/>
ours that diſallow what is done amiſſe, yet make not the force of the Word and Sacraments, much leſſe their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and very ſubſtance to depend on the Miniſters Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Calling, or elſe theirs which defeat, diſanull, and annihilate both, in reſpect of that one onely perſonal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; there being not any Law of God which faith, That if the Miniſter be incompetent, his word ſhall be no word, his Baptiſme, no Baptiſme. He which teacheth and is not ſent, loſeth the reward, but yet retaineth the name of a teacher, his uſurped actions have in him the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which they have in others, although they yeeld him not the ſame comfort. And if theſe two caſes be peers, the caſe of Doctrine, and the caſe of Baptiſm both alike, ſith no defect in their Vocation, that teach the truth, is able to take away this benefit thereof from him which heareth; wherefore ſhould the want of a lawfull calling in them that bapitze, make Baptiſm vain? And again, <hi>fol.</hi> 332: The Grace of Baptiſme cometh by donation from God alone; that God hath committed the Miniſtery of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme unto ſpeciall men, it is for Orders ſake in his Church, and not to the end that their Authority might give being, or adde force to the Sacrament it ſelf. That Infants have right to the Sacrament of Baptiſm, we all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge. Charge them we cannot as guileſull, and wrongful poſſeſſors of that whereunto they have right by the manifeſt will of the Donor, and are not parties un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any defect or diſorder in the manner of receiving the ſame. And if any ſuch diſorder be, we have ſufficiently before declared, that <hi>Delictum cum capite ſemper ambu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat,</hi> Mens own faul's are their own harms. Wherefore to countervail this and the like miſ choſen reſemblances with that which more truly and plainly agreeth: The Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of God concerning their vocation that miniſter Baptiſme, wherein the Myſtery of our regeneration is wrought, hath thereunto the ſame Analogy which Laws of wedlock have to our firſt nativity and birth. So that if nature do effect Procreation notwithſtanding the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

violation and breach of Natures law, made that the entrance of all mankind into this preſent world might be without blemiſh; may we not juſtly preſume that Grace doth accompliſh the other, although there be faultineſs in them which tranſgreſs the order which our Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath eſtabliſhed in his Church? <hi>And afterwards again, lib. 5. fol.</hi> 448. That therefore wherein a Miniſter differeth from other Chriſtian men, is not, as ſome have childiſhly imagined, the ſound preaching of the Word of God, but as they are lawfully and truly Governors to whom authority of regiment is given in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, according to the order which Polity hath ſet; ſo Canonical ordination in the Church of Chriſt is that which maketh a lawful Miniſter, as touching the validity of any act which appertaineth to the vocation.

But of this more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p>30. In the mean time it is to me a wonder, how thoſe that do now ſo much inſiſt upon the neceſſity of their agreement with that Doctrine and Diſcipline which was formerly ſet down by the Church of <hi>England,</hi> amongſt which the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent uſe of Sermons and Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>raments were ſet down as duties neceſſary to our Chriſtian profeſſion, (if not ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) can now be ſo much changed from their firſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, as to decline thoſe means and inſtruments which by the providence of God are for the preſent ſent us to that very end, and that only for want of ſuch like formality of induction or inſtitution which the Rule of the Church or State did in that caſe formerly appoint; and can now, even while they do profeſs their conſtancie in the ſame belief, go about to perſwade againſt effectualneſs of adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, either in one kind or other, through any ſuch like ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection. More likely to my thinking it ſhould follow, that ſince there is ſuch a great neceſſity ſtill remaining in the frequent uſe of theſe things, and ſince ſuch manner of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, induction, and other qualifications as they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have received, can only warrant men to be right hearers or receivers, that therefore it is incumbent on them as a neceſſary duty to be doing hereof, for fear of that ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, <hi>Wo if I preach not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:55989:27"/>31. In which caſe if we ſhall compare the cauſe and proſecution of Nonconformiſts now in their ſcandal in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of abridgment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with thoſe exceptions and that demean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or therein, which the former Nonconformiſts made againſt the Churches too great impoſition in that kind, we may (as I conceive) attribute more reaſon and Chriſtian charity and moderation to them, than theſe. For amongſt them it was held for a Maxim, That they would rather preach in a Fools coat, then be deprived of that benefit which might come by their<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Miniſtry and preaching. And this the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcreeter and more moderate ſort did; although the doing of a thing conceived to be unlawful by the Law of God, be more to be ſcrupled at then the forbearance of a thing held lawful by the authority of the Church, which, in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition they then ſtood in, would not ſuffer them to be Preachers, without actual uſe of the Surplice, or the like: whereas amongſt us, neither ſubſcription, nor uſe of any thing in the like kind, is by preſent Authority en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined.</p>
               <p>32. And as for thoſe that ſo much ſtand upon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer inſtitutions of the Service-book, and other Rites and Ceremonies, if we ſhould have reſpect only to aboliſhed Laws, yet do I not find that it is any where ſaid, that no Sermon or Sacrament ſhall at any time be held lawfully or effectually made or done, when theſe ſhall not be alſo uſed: But the intention of the Act of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity</hi> (as an Act of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity</hi>) muſt be conſtrued, that in the times appointed for the uſe of ſuch like things, that then, for preſervation of peace and uniformity in the Church, none other but thoſe ſhall be uſed. Doth the Act any where ſay, or can any preſume it did mean, that no man ſhould preach at any time a Sermon, or come to hear others do ſo, unleſs, at the ſame time, the Service-book, or part of it were read? No certainly, if we conſider the injunction, as to perſons, it will be plain it lies not upon Preachers as Preachers, but upon ſuch as had fixed miniſterial charge in delivering of the Sacraments, or the like, to the which the Book had
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:55989:27"/>
chief reference; and not enjoined on them neither, if they had <hi>Vicars</hi> or <hi>Curates</hi> to do it. It is not ſaid, if any <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Paſtor,</hi> or <hi>Lecturer</hi> ſhall refuſe; nor was ever ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued. For experience tells us, that never any did do it when they preached, if they could have it conveniently omitted or done by others; being, while the Law was in force, ſeldom read by Biſhop, Dean, or Doctor, but left to thoſe of inferior ſort, however now it be preſſed as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.</p>
               <p>33. And if we conſider the intent of the words directing to the uſe of this Book or Form, they muſt be conſtrued by way of ſecluſion of all other. Which will be manifeſt to ſuch unprejudiced perſons as ſhall conſider how the whole ſcope of the Act doth condemn ſuch as did by <hi>ſpeech or action derogate</hi> or <hi>deprave</hi> againſt the uſe of the Service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>book or Ceremonies, as unfit or unlawful, and not thoſe that did approve them: And therefore it preſcribes no pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment to ſuch as in obedience to Authority, do, againſt their own liking forbear to uſe or hear it; but ſuch as, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the authority of the Church, do <hi>refuſe</hi> it, out of contempt of their power, or better liking to ſome other form; ſaying, <hi>If any manner of Parſon, Vicar, or other Miniſter whatſoever, that ought or ſhould ſing or ſay Common Prayer mentioned in the ſaid Book, or miniſter the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, from and after the Feaſt of the Nativity of St.</hi> John Baptiſt <hi>next coming,</hi> refuſe <hi>to uſe the ſaid Common-Prayer, or to miniſter the Sacraments in ſuch Cathedral or Pariſh-Church or other places, as he ſhould uſe to miniſter the ſame, in ſuch order and form as they be mentioned and ſet forth in the ſaid Book, or ſhall, wilfully and obſtinately ſtanding in the ſame, uſe any other Rite, Ceremony, order, form, or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of celebrating the Lords Supper, openly or privily, or Mattens, Evenſong, Adminiſtration of the Sacraments, or other open prayers, then is mentioned and ſet forth in the ſaid Book, &amp;c.</hi> But then again in caſe they do not refuſe, but have been willing and made offer of doing it, and have been by others diſturbed in the uſe of that, or made to uſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other;
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:55989:28"/>
why then, by the judgment of that very Act, they are not compriſed in any blame. But the puniſhment laid on ſuch as ſhould by <hi>open fact, deed, or by open threatenings compel or cauſe, or otherwiſe procure or maintain any Parſon, Vicar, or other Miniſter in any Cathedral or Pariſh-Church, or in Chappel, or in any other place, to ſing or ſay any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon or open Prayer, or to miniſter any Sacrament, otherwiſe or in any other manner and form then is mentioned in the ſaid Book; or by any of the ſaid means ſhall</hi> unlawfully <hi>interrupt or let any Parſon, Vicar, or other Miniſter in any Cathedral or Pariſh-Church, Chappel, or any other place, to ſing or ſay any Common and open Prayer, or to miniſter the Sacraments or any of them, in ſuch manner and form as is mentioned in the ſaid Book<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that then every ſuch perſon, being lawfully convicted in form aboveſaid, ſhall forfeit to the Queen our Soveraign Lady, her heirs and ſucceſſors, for the firſt offence an hundred marks.</hi> And ſo the Act goes on, preſcribing ſtill greater puniſhments for the ſecond and third offences, by way of mulct to the Queen and her Succeſſors.</p>
               <p>34. But now, what if her Succeſſors come to enact againſt the uſe of it, and be themſelves <hi>Compellers and Threateners,</hi> may we not then conclude that they may <hi>law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully</hi> interrupt, or at leaſt the other be excuſed for being interrupted; where before, in a Subject, it was <hi>unlawful to interrupt or let any Parſon,</hi> in the doing what was by the then Law eſtabliſhed? So that by this very Act (as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) ſuch as have a reverend eſteem and willingneſs to uſe it, are not only freed <hi>foro interno<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> but, by the Clauſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, enacting, <hi>That no perſon ſhall be at any time here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after impeached or moleſted of or for any of the offences above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hereafter to be committed or done contrary to this Act, unleſs he or they ſo offending be thereof indicted at the next General Seſſions to be holden before any ſuch Juſtices of Oyer and Determiner, or Juſtices of Aſſiſe next after any offence committed or done contrary to the tenor of this Act;</hi> we may conlude he is freed <hi>foro externo</hi> alſo, and may (for ought I can find) reſt free from all danger, while obedient

to the Queens Succeſſory, ſhe dying without an Heir.</p>
               <p>35. And if by reaſon of any Oath or Obligation received at Ordination, or taking degrees, ſome ſhould think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves farther bound; They are alſo to conſider, that as neither any derived power can go beyond that which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powers it, ſo are they alſo to preſume that their intentions are alike; even to maintain Peace and Order, by Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to what is enjoyned, and not to raiſe diſturbance by oppoſition. And ſurely, if Oaths, Vows or the like, were to be held of force in ſuch a caſe; I ſee not how any Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite or Prieſt could in reaſon, no nor in Conſcience, be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to recede in any thing from their obedience and conformity to the Papall Sea and Ceremony; when as their Promiſes are not only more ſtrict, but confirmed by Laws more ancient and general, and which are ſtill in the ſame force.</p>
               <p>36. It is alſo farther to be conſidered that when after in the Preface to our Bibles it is ſet down, <hi>That where hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there hath been great diverſity in ſaying and ſinging in Churches within this Realm,</hi> ſome following <hi>Salisbury</hi> uſe, ſome <hi>Hereford</hi> uſe, ſome the uſe of <hi>Bangor,</hi> ſome of <hi>York,</hi> and ſome of <hi>Lincoln;</hi> now, <hi>from henceforth, all the whole Realm ſhall have but one uſe:</hi> And when in the directions following that Preface it is ſet down; <hi>That all Prieſts and Deacons ſhould be bound daily to ſay the Morning and Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Prayer, either privately, or openly, except they be let by preaching, ſtudying of Divinity, or ſome other urgent cauſe:</hi> We are ſtill to conceive that both Uniformity was aimed at, and that the duty of Preaching was in the firſt place held neceſſary.</p>
               <p>37. And if we go to experience, in their practiſe of this precept of reading of the Service Book, then we ſhall find it apprehended as an injunction that did onely bind them <hi>ad ſemper velle,</hi> but not <hi>ad ſemper agere,</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> (elſewhere) ſpeaks of Gods affirmative Precepts, as <hi>Pray continually,</hi> and the like,) and that thereupon few could give account of their daily uſe of it, even when the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:55989:29"/>
of preaching, ſtudying, or the like, could not well be alledged, as before noted. And therefore if in a time when it was commanded, the uſe of it might be forborn, rather then preaching be omitted, what may we think of them that in a time it is taken away, will yet rather omit preaching then it; to the great diſcouragement and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall of many a man in his Chriſtian obedience and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and to the great detriment of the nation in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall: who, in a time of ſcarcity, are much wanting of that inſtruction which might be had from men of their abilities. In which reſpect, as I am my ſelf a true lover of many of them for their learning and gifts in that kinde, ſo hath the ſence of mine own loſſe, as well as that of others now made me thus large in this particular.</p>
               <p>38. But, beſides this, and the want of ſatisfaction how they can in this condition uphold the Church of <hi>England</hi> in her former ſentence againſt non<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> conformity, if upon the ſame ſcore they ſhall ſlight her authority themſelves; They are next to conſider, what anſwer for their preſent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſancy they can bring, which on the other ſide, ſhall not withall juſtifie the Recuſants themſelves in their ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from our Communion alſo. For plain it is (as I ſaid before) that as the drift of all the arguments brought for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly by the Papiſts againſt our Churches authority, was in reſpect of uſurpation in our Princes, and want of ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, lawfull ordination, and the like in our Prieſts; ſo was the ſum of all their Doctrine that wrote in defence of what was done by us, brought to this iſſue: That theſe things were not eſſentiall to Salvation, or to the being of a Church: That each Chriſtian Church, having (as hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſet down) a power within it ſelf for ordering its own affairs, had as well power to abbreviate or abrogate what was in former times, or by other Churches inſtituted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as to inſtitute that which was new; ſo that the caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out from our Service Book, and leaving out of our pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Forms of Worſhip, all ſuch Prayers, Ceremonies, and Obſervations, as in the opinion of thoſe that then had
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:55989:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
power in the Church, had on the one ſide little or no foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Scripture, and which had on the other ſide greateſt Superſtition caſt towards them, was then held lawfull: as by that Declaration annexed to our Bibles, <hi>concerning Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, why ſome be aboliſhed, and ſome retained,</hi> may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. And if it was then held agreeable, and the Church thought a fit Judge, wherein Superſtition was moſt to be feared, and what was the beſt way of Reformation; how can we now change our Principle, unleſſe we joyn with the adverſary to d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

Muſt the Greek Patriarchs receive ſpiritual juriſdiction from the Greek <hi>Turk?</hi> Did the Pope by the baptiſm of Princes, loſe the ſpiritual power he formerly had of conferring ſpiritual juriſdiction upon Biſhops? Hath the Temporal Magiſtrate authority to preach, to aſſoil from ſins, to inflict Excommunications and other cenſures? Why hath he not power to excommunicate, as well as to diſpenſe in irregularity, as our late Soveraign Lord King <hi>James</hi> either diſpenſed with the late Archbiſhop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi> or elſe gave Commiſſion to ſome Biſhops to do it? And ſince they were ſubject to the Primate, and not he to them, it is cleer that they had no power to diſpenſe with him, but that power muſt proceed from the Prince as ſuperior to them all, and Head in the Proteſtants Church in <hi>England.</hi> If we have no ſuch authority, how can he give to others what himſelf hath not?

The Pope, from whom originally you muſt beg your ſucceſſion of Biſhops, never received, nor will, nor can acknowledg to receive any ſpiritual juriſdiction from any temporal Prince: And therefore if juriſdiction muſt be derived from Princes, he hath none at all; and yet either you muſt acknowledg that he hath ſpiritual juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, or that your ſelves can receive none from him. And afterwards again, <hi>ſect.</hi> 22. he ſaith; But beſides this
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:55989:30"/>
defect in the perſonal ſucceſſion of Proteſtant Biſhops, there is another of great moment, which is, that they want the right form of ordaining Biſhops and Prieſts; becauſe the manner which they uſe is ſo much different from the Roman Church (at leaſt according to the common opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Divines) that it cannot be ſufficient for the eſſence of Ordination, as I could demonſtrate if this were the proper place of ſuch a Treatiſe, and will not fail to do if D. <hi>Potter</hi> give me occaſion. In the mean time, the Reader may be pleaſed to read the Author cited here in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, and then compare our form of Ordination with that of Proteſtants; and to remember, that if the form which they uſe either in conſecrating Biſhops, or in ordaining Prieſts, be at leaſt doubtful, they can never have undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Prieſts nor Biſhops: For Prieſts cannot be ordained but by true Biſhops; nor can any be true Biſhop, unleſs he be at firſt Prieſt. I ſay, their Ordination is at leaſt doubtful, becauſe that ſufficeth for my preſent purpoſe. For, Biſhops and Prieſts, whoſe Ordination is notoriouſly known to be but doubtful, are not to be eſteemed Biſhops or Prieſts, and no man without ſacrilege can receive Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments from them, all which they adminiſter unlawfully. And (if we except Baptiſm with manifeſt danger of inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity, and with obligation to be at leaſt conditionally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated) ſo Proteſtants muſt remain doubtful of Remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſins, of their Eccleſiaſtical Hierarchy, and may not pretend to be a true Church, which cannot ſubſiſt without undoubted true Biſhops and Prieſts, nor without due ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of Sacraments, which (according to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants) is an eſſential note of the true Church. And it is a world to obſerve the proceeding of Engliſh Proteſtants in this point of their Ordination: For firſt, <hi>An. 3 Ed. 6. cap.</hi> 2. when he was a Child about twelve years of age, it was enacted, That ſuch a form of making and conſecrating of Biſhops and Prieſts, as by ſix Prelates and ſix other to be appointed by the King ſhould be deviſed (Mark well this word <hi>deviſed</hi>) and ſet forth under the Great Seal,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:55989:31"/>
ſhould be uſed, and none other. But after this Act was repealed, 1 <hi>Mar. Seſſ.</hi> 2. Inſomuch as that when after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, <hi>An. 6 &amp; 7 Regin. Eliz.</hi> Biſhop <hi>Bonner</hi> being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted upon a Certificate made by Doctor <hi>Horn</hi> a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> for his refuſal of the Oath of Supremacie, and excepting againſt the Indictment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Dr. <hi>Horn</hi> was no Biſhop; they were all at a ſtand till <hi>An. 8 Eliz. cap.</hi> 1. the Act of <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. was renewed and confirmed, with a particular Proviſo, That no man ſhould be impreached or moleſted by means of any Certificate by any Biſhop or Archbiſhop made before this laſt Act: whereby it is cleer that they made ſome doubt of their own Ordination, and that there is nothing but uncertainty in the whole buſineſs of their Ordination, which (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth) muſt depend on ſix Prelates, the Great Seal, Acts of Parliament being contrary one to another, and the like.</q> So that you ſee all along the authority and interpoſition of the Magiſtrate is ſcoffed at, and by them made ineffectual in the ordering of the affairs of the Church; nay the Church muſt be no Church, if not wholly and independently go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by the Clergy, and a Clergy too that do particularly derive their Ordination and power from a forein Head, and according to Rights and Ceremonies then aboliſhed. If none but true Prieſts can adminiſter the Sacraments, nor none but true Biſhops make true Prieſts, nor none but the Pope make true Biſhops, (but that the authority of the Magiſtrate doth interpoſe) why then no true Sacraments, nor no true Church, by their doctrine. And to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he doth put a <hi>mark</hi> upon the word <hi>deviſed,</hi> as deriding the Civil power therein:</p>
               <p>38. If we ſhall add to this what was (before him) ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by Father <hi>Parſons</hi> concerning the inſtitution of the Service-book, and objected againſt the validity and uſe of it, as well as the power to aboliſh their Maſs and other Ceremonies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it will make us wary in condemning leſs Alterations now made by a greater Power, while yet we ſhall commend conformity to a leſs Power, in a matter of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:55989:31"/>
greater alteration. For he alleadgeth in his Book of the <hi>Three Converſions of England, par. 2. chap. 12. ſect.</hi> 25. That the Reformation and Service-book were made by the then <hi>Protector</hi> to <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, (who it is well known had no ſuch power and ſoveraignty in himſelf as our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>Protector</hi> hath.) And to this end he ſaith: <q>And now Candles, Aſhes, and Images being gone (as you ſee) there followed in the next moneth after (to wit, <hi>March</hi>) that the <hi>Protector</hi> ſtill deſiring to go forward with his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignment of alteration, ſent abroad a Proclamation in the Kings name, with a certain Communion-book in Engliſh, to be uſed for adminiſtration of Sacraments in ſtead of the Maſs-book. But whether it was the very ſame that was rejected a little before in the Parliament, or another patched up afterward, or the ſame mended or altered, is not ſo cleer. But great care there was had by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector and his adherents, that this Book ſhould be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and put in practice preſently, even before it was allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Parliament. To which effect <hi>Fox</hi> ſetteth down a large Letter of the Council to all Biſhops, exhorting and commanding them, in the Kings name, to admit and put in practice this Book. <hi>We have thought good</hi> (ſay they) <hi>to pray and require your Lordſhips, and nevertheleſs in the Kings Majeſties our moſt dread Lords name to command you, to have a diligent, earneſt and careful reſpect to cauſe theſe Books to be delivered to every Parſon, Vicar and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate within your Dioceſe, with ſuch diligence, as they may have ſufficient time well to inſtruct and adviſe themſelves for the diſtribution of the moſt holy Communion, according to the Order of this Book, before this Eaſter time, &amp;c. praying you to conſider, that this Order is ſet forth to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent there ſhould be in all parts of the Realm one uniform manner quietly uſed. To the execution whereof we do eft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoons require you to have a diligent respect, as you tender the Kings Majeſties pleaſure, and will anſwer to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, &amp;c.</hi> From <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> the 13. of <hi>March,</hi> 1548. By all which, and by much more that might be alleadged,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:55989:32"/>
it is evident, that all that was hitherto done againſt Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Religion for theſe firſt two years, until the ſecond Parliament, was done by private authority of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector and his adherents, before Law, and againſt Law, &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p>40. And if we look farther into the Preamble of the firſt Statute that confirmed this Book, by him alſo ſet down a little after, <hi>ſect.</hi> 35. we may find that the ſaid Book was appointed firſt for Uniformity; and next, that it or ſome other had been ſet on foot before by the Lord Protector in the Kings name. The words are; <hi>Where of long time</hi> (ſaith the Act) <hi>there hath been in this Realm of</hi> England <hi>divers Forms of Common-Prayer, commonly called the Service of the Church, as well concerning Mattens and Evenſong, as alſo the whole Communion called the Maſs, &amp;c. And where the Kings Majeſty, with the advice of his moſt entirely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncle the Lord Protector, and others of his Highneſs Council, hath heretofore divers times aſſayed to ſtay Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations or new Rites concerning the premiſſes; yet the ſame hath not had ſuch good ſucceſs as his Highneſs required in that behalf. Whereupon his Highneſs by the most prudent advice aforeſaid, being pleaſed to bear with the frailty and weakneſs of his Subjects in that behalf, of his great clemencie hath not been only content to abſtain from puniſhment in that behalf; but alſo to the intent that an uniform, quiet, and godly order ſhould be had concerning the premiſſes, hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the Archbiſhop of</hi> Canterbury <hi>and certain of the moſt learned and diſcreet Biſhops, to conſider and ponder the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes; and thereupon having as well an eye and reſpect to the moſt ſincere and pure Chriſtian Religion taught by the Scriptures, as the uſages of the Primitive Church, ſhould draw and make one convenient and meet order, rite and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion of Common-Prayer and adminiſtration of Sacraments to be uſed in</hi> England, Wales, <hi>&amp;c. The which at this time by the aid of the Holy Ghoſt, with uniform agreement, is of them concluded, ſet forth and delivered, to his Highneſs great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and quietneſs of mind, in a Book entituled,</hi> The Book of Common-Prayer and Adminiſtration of Sacraments, &amp;c.</p>

                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:55989:32"/>Now truly I cannot, for my part, ſee how we can make either the firſt Impoſition or receipt of this Book lawfull if we ſtick not to our main principle in acknowledging the preſent ſupream Chriſtian Magiſtrate to be head of the Church, which doubtleſs the Protector was in the non-age of the King. And if thoſe elder Reformed Proteſtants amongſt us, did well to conform to this authority in abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition of the Maſſe, and other very ancient ſervices, and that notwithſtanding the Book had been by Parliament already rejected, there ſeems to me great reaſon to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to what an Act of Parliament and a Protector of more power, hath determined concerning another alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of this kinde. To think that the Book, or the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies thereby appointed, had of themſelves, (ſeparate from that Authority, by which they were deviſed and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>impoſed) any ſuch inherent and divine worth, as for their own ſake to claim admittance and continuance, were plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to contradict the act it ſelf, and the Stories of thoſe times which tell us by whom it was made, and by whom commanded, and it doth plainly croſs the judgement of Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> himſelf, who in his anſwer to Mr. <hi>Travers, fol.</hi> 471. may be found giving ſentence for indifferency in the uſe of theſe things as in themſelves, by the inſtance of kneeling, ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or walking, at receiving of Sacraments; his words are, <q>An order as I learn, there was tendred, that Communicants ſhould neither kneel, as in the moſt places of the Realm: nor ſit as in this place the cuſtome is, but walk to the one ſide of the Table, and there ſtanding till they had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, paſſe afterwards away round about by the other; which being on a ſudden begun to be practiſed in the Church, ſome ſat wondring what it ſhould mean, others deliberating what to do, till ſuch time, as at length by name one of them being called openly thereunto, requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that they might do as they had been accuſtomed, which was granted, and as Maſter <hi>Travers</hi> had admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred his way to the reſt; ſo a Curate was ſent to miniſter to them after their way, which unproſperous beginning

although this power were formerly given to the chief Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate while they had the ſtile of King or Queen, yet if we ſhall impartially conſider the intention of that Act whereby this power was exerciſed by the King, we ſhall finde that it, like all Laws, having a regard to the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall conſervation of Peace, Order, and Unity, did not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it to perſons ſo ſtiled onely, but that it might be kept for ever, did for <hi>ever unite it to the Imperial Crown of this Realm;</hi> that is, to the Monarch thereof, although no King, nor more crowned, nor anointed then ſome of the Roman Emperors were; and accordingly we ſhall find Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> to underſtand and apply it; for reckoning up the Subject whereof his eight Books are to treat, He ſaith, <hi>The eight is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the power of Eccleſiaſtical dominion or Supream Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which with us, the higheſt Governour or Prince, hath as well in reſpect of domeſtical juriſdictions, as of that other for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rainly claimed by the Biſhop of Rome.</hi> In which expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions <hi>of Higheſt Governour or Prince<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Which done, he proceeds to cenſure that uſurpation of power foreignly claimed by Pope and Cardinals, who under pretence of this title would enter common with Chriſtian Kings; proving that thirty three times in Scripture the terms of <hi>Gods anointed</hi> are uſed, and no where to be applied to any but Patriarchs, Chriſt himſelf, or of Kings all: ſhewing farther, that others, Prieſts, Prophets, or the like, although they were anointed, and might be ſo called yet were never ſtiled, <hi>the Lords a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

So that even after it was taken up, yet the Ceremony and the claim by it, would not hold. The truth is, the Ceremony doth not any thing; onely declareth what is done. The party was before, as much as he is after it: Onely by it is declared to be, that he was before, and the which he ſhould have been ſtill; though he had never ſo been declared. The truth may and doth ſubſiſt, as with the Ceremony, ſo without it. It may be retained, as with ſome it is, and with us it is, and it may be ſpared as it is with others; ſpared or retained, all is one; no claim groweth that way. But laſt of all, where it was uſed, as by <hi>Samuel</hi> to <hi>Saul,</hi> by <hi>Zadoc</hi> to <hi>Solomon:</hi> yet they clai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med nothing in the parties they anointed, but called them ſtill Gods, and never their own anointed: They knew no claim lay by it.

forth alſo by divers inſtances of perſonal failings, both in Government and Religion, as well among the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors as others, that no ſuch pretence of fault could debar the perſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> him that was in power, of this priviledg and title, ſo as to give liberty of touching him either with hand, tongue, or pen, or the like: For (ſaith he) <hi>It is the adminiſtration to govern, not the gift to govern well; the right of ruling not the ruling right: It includes nothing but a due Title; it excludes nothing but <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation.</hi> And he asks the queſtion, <hi>who is anointed?</hi> and anſwers it, <hi>on whom the right reſts:</hi> And ſo again he asketh, Who is <hi>inunctus?</hi> and anſwers, <hi>He that hath it not,</hi> that is (as I conceive) hath not this right <hi>by adminiſtration to govern,</hi> or immediate poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Government.

For firſt having ſpoken of that ſacred power which belongs to each Chriſtian King as anointed, he was to oppoſe to it all foreign claim, whether craftily entred upon, as the Pope mentioned before, or forcibly, as now inſtanced in <hi>Nimrod;</hi> eſpecially if a Heathen, or of another Religion; in which reſpect he could not be reckoned among the <hi>Chriſti,</hi> not <hi>caring for anointing,</hi> or to have care of Church or Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

which is the drift of this Diſcourſe.

And if he did do ſo as <hi>David</hi> did to the family of <hi>Saul,</hi> and have not the like Divine anointing and warrant as he had; how ſhall Subjects be ſo guided in their diſtinction as not miſtake and think every one a Uſurper? For if ſuch an one be a Uſurper, then are Chriſtian Kingdoms governed by a race of Uſurpers. Nay by Uſurpers too, if (as he ſaith) right be to be derived from the firſt beginner of a Race.</p>
               <p>44. And it is alſo to be noted, that this derivation of right from firſt ſeiſure, as though his right were beſt, even as <hi>Davids</hi> was better then any that followed, doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict that fancy of preſcription, as meer fancy indeed; wherein it is made worſt: or rather to have no worth at all, but that the Succeſſors do arrive at Lawfulneſs, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as by degrees they ſhall be removed from it.</p>
               <p>45. And to prove his meaning to be that Subjects may

not upon any ſuch Allegation riſe or reſiſt, we ſhall finde him inſtancing in the caſe of <hi>Saul,</hi> of whom he ſaith, <hi>fol.</hi> 791. <q>I verily think God, in this firſt example, of his firſt King over his own people, hath purpoſely ſuffered them all to fall out, and to be found in him; even all that ſhould fall out in any King after him, to enforce their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition: that ſo we might find them anſwered to our hands. To touch them in Order; they would eaſily have quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled at <hi>Sauls</hi> miſ government. Not at the firſt; he then was a mild and a gracious Prince.

But within a while, he grew ſo ſtern and fierce, as no man might ſpeak to him. Upon every light occaſion, nay, upon no occaſion at all, his Javelin went ſtraight to nail men to the wall; not <hi>David</hi> onely, but <hi>Jonathan</hi> his Son and Heir apparant, and no cauſe why.

But <hi>Saul</hi> went further a great deal; yea further then <hi>Oza:</hi> For he

took upon him to ſacrifice in perſon himſelf; to offer burnt offerings upon the very Altar, the Higheſt part of all the Prieſts Office: that is, uſurped further then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did any.

For firſt, if none could be thought duly elected, but where every man in all parties did perſonally agree, or might be concluded to do ſo; this were impoſſible.

                  <q>It is from our purpoſe to enter the queſtion, Whether the power were in the whole body originally? Seeing, though it were, it is now by the poſitive ordinance of God otherwiſe diſpoſed. The reaſon may ſeem to be, partly neceſſity of expedition; the Trumpets may need to be blown ſometimes ſuddenly, ſooner then divers can well meet, and agree upon it too. Partly avoiding of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction: The two Trumpets may be blown two divers ways, if they be in two hands, and ſo ſhall the Trumpet give an uncertain ſound, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) and how ſhall the Congregation know whither to aſſemble? Nay (a worſe matter yet then all that) ſo may we have Aſſembly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Aſſembly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and rather then ſo, better no Aſſembly at all. Therefore, as God would have them both made of one piece, ſo will be have them both made over to one perſon; for. [<hi>Tibi</hi>] implieth one. Who is that one? It is to <hi>Moſes</hi> God ſpeaketh; to him is this <hi>Tibi</hi> directed: Him doth God nominate, and of his perſon make choice firſt to make theſe Trumpets, no man to make, no man to have the hammering of any Trumpet but he. And there is no queſtion, but for <hi>Aaron</hi> and his ſons the Prieſts, they are to call the Levites, to call the people together to their Aſſemblies: How ſhall they warn them together, unleſs they make a Trumpet too? But if there be any queſtion about this, Gods proceeding here will put all out of queſtion: For to whom giveth he this charge? Not to <hi>Aaron</hi> is this ſpoken, but to <hi>Moſes: Aaron</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth no charge to make any Trumpet; never a <hi>fac tibi</hi> to him, neither in this, nor in any other place.

And how then ſhall <hi>Aarons</hi> Aſſemblies be called? with what Trumpet they? God himſelf hath provided for that in the tenth
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:55989:41"/>
verſe following, that with no other then theſe. (There is in all the Law no order for calling an Aſſembly, to what end, or for what cauſe ſoever, but this, and only this: no order for making any third Trumpet; under theſe two therefore all are compriſed.) This order there God taketh, that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhall permit <hi>Aarons</hi> ſons to have the uſe of theſe Trumpets; but the <hi>uſe,</hi> not the <hi>property.</hi> They muſt take them from <hi>Moſes,</hi> as (in the 31. Chapter of this Book <hi>Phineas</hi> doth) But <hi>Erunt tibi,</hi> Gods own words, <hi>Erunt tibi</hi> muſt ſtill be remembred: His they be, for all that; <hi>Moſes</hi> the owner ſtill, the right remains in him; their ſounding of them deprives not him of his intereſt, alters not the property: <hi>Erunt tibi</hi> muſt ſtill be true, that right muſt ſtill be preſerved. It may be, if we communicate with fleſh and blood, we may think it more convenient (as ſome do) that God had deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> either of them one: But when we ſee Gods will by Gods word what it is, that <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> is to have them both; we will let that paſs as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of fleſh and blood, and think that which God thinketh to be moſt convenient.</q>

               <p>
                  <q>Now then, if the Trumpets belong to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and that to this end, that with them he may call the Congregation, theſe two things do follow. Firſt, that if he call, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation muſt not refuſe to come. Secondly, that unleſs he call, they muſt not aſſemble of their own heads, but keep their places. Briefly thus: The Congregation muſt come when it is called, and it muſt be called ere it come. Theſe are the two duties we owe to the two Trumpets; and both theſe have Gods people ever performed. And yet not ſo, but that this right hath been called in queſtion, yea even in <hi>Moſes</hi> own time, (that we marvel not if it be ſo now) and both theſe duties denied him, even by thoſe who were alive and preſent then when God gave him the Trumpets. But mark by whom, and what became of them. The firſt duty is, to come when they be called; and this was denied (in the 16 Chapter following, <hi>ver.</hi> 12.)
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:55989:41"/>
by <hi>Core, Dathan,</hi> and their Crew: <hi>Moſes</hi> ſounded his Trumpet, ſent to call them; they anſwer flatly, (and that not once, but once and again) <hi>Non veniemus,</hi> they would not come, not once ſtir for him or his Trumpet, they. A plain contradiction indeed; neither is there in all that Chapter any contradiction <hi>veri nominis,</hi> truly and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo to be called, but only that. You know what became of them; they went quick to hell for it: And wo be to them even under the Goſpel (ſaith Saint <hi>Jude</hi>) that periſh in the ſame contradiction, the contradiction of <hi>Core.</hi> The ſecond duty is, To be called ere they come. This like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe denied even <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf, (that they in his place might not think ſtrange of it) in the 20 Chapter of this very Book. Water waxing ſcant, a company of them grew mutinous, and in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But theſe are branded too; the water they got, is called the water of <hi>Meriba:</hi> And what followed, you know; none of them that drunk of it; came into the Land of Promiſe; <hi>God ſwore they ſhould not enter into his reſt.</hi> Now, as both theſe are bad; ſo of the twain this latter is the worſe. The former (<hi>that came not, being called</hi>) do but ſit ſtill, as if they were ſomewhat thick of hearing: But theſe latter (<hi>that come, being not called</hi>) either they make themſelves a Trumpet, without ever a <hi>fac tibi;</hi> or elſe they offer to wring <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Trumpet out of his hands, and take it into their own. Take heed of this latter: It is ſaid there to be <hi>adverſus Moſen,</hi> even againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf. It is the very next forerunner to it, it pricks faſt upon it: For they that meet againſt <hi>Moſes</hi>'s will, when they have once throughly learned that leſſon, will quickly perhaps grow capable of another, even to meet againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf, as theſe did. <hi>Periclitamur arguiſeditio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And now to our Saviour Chriſts Queſtion: <hi>In the Law how is it written? How read you?</hi> Our Anſwer is; There it is thus written, and thus we read, That <hi>Moſes</hi> hath the right of the Trumpets, that they to go ever with him and his Succeſſors, and that to them belongs the power of calling the Publick Aſſemblies. This is the Law of God; and that no Judicial Law, peculiar to that people alone, but agreable to the Law of Nature and Nations (two Laws of force through the whole world) For even in the little Empire of the Body natural, <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipium motus,</hi> the beginning of all motion is in and from the Head: There all the knots, or (as they call them) all the conjugations of ſinews have their head, by which all the Body is moved. And as the Law of Nature, by ſecret inſtinct, by the light of the Creation, annexeth the Organ of the chiefeſt part; even ſo doth the Law of Nations, by the light of Reaſon, to the chiefeſt perſon; and both fall juſt with the Law here written, where (by <hi>erunt tibi</hi>) the ſame Organ and Power is committed to <hi>Moſes,</hi> the principal perſon; in that Commonwealth; The Law of Nations in this point (both before the <hi>Law written,</hi> and ſince, where the <hi>Law written</hi> was not known) might eaſily appear, if time would ſuffer, both in their general order for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions ſo to be called, and in their general oppoſing to all Conventicles called otherwiſe.</q>

How then? how ſhall we do for an Aſſembly? then <hi>Erunt tibi,</hi> was a good Text; it muſt needs be meant of the Prince; He had this power, and to him of right it belonged. This was then good Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity (and what Writer is there extant of thoſe times, but it may may be turned to in him?)

Now if not for the love of the truth, yet for very ſhame of theſe ſhifting abſurdities, let theſe phantaſies be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned; and (that which Gods own mouth hath here ſpoken) let it be for once and for ever true; That which once we truly held and maintained for truth, let us do ſo ſtill; that we be not like evil Servants, judged (<hi>Ex ore propris</hi>) out of their own mouthes.</q>

               <p>I have the more largely made recital of this Sermon, becauſe all along it is ſo expreſs in cleering of moſt of thoſe objections which are now made. Now as it was then in anſwer to the Recuſants and Nonconformiſts of thoſe

For he ſheweth, that ſince the Church hath <hi>her Wars to fight, and her Laws to make, as well as the Civil State;</hi> that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is as neceſſary there ſhould be a continual power to call and preſide in all Aſſemblies made to that purpoſe in the Church, as well as in the State: That theſe Trumpers are to be of <hi>one peece, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nus juris:</hi> That <hi>this power is from God, immediately derived unto one, without firſt ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it into any body collective at all.</hi> And therefore truly if a whole National Church can claim no Church power, no one party, or ſeparate Order therein can, although they ſhould be as eminent as <hi>Aaron</hi> himſelf; No, both powers are delivered to <hi>Moſes,</hi> not for his time onely, but as he had it, as the chief Magiſtrate, ſo to ſucceed to ſuch as ſhould be chief Magiſtrates amongſt the people of God, as a <hi>Jus Regale</hi> to him that ſhould be <hi>Rex in Jeſhru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne;</hi> although in ſtrict propriety, he be no more King then <hi>Moſes</hi> was. And then he cenſures ſuch as would, in regard of their ſeparate order ſain have had a ſeparate power. <hi>It may be</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if we communicate with fleſh and blood, we may think it more convenient (as ſome do) that God had delivered</hi> Moſes <hi>and</hi> Aaron <hi>either of them one: But when we ſee Gods Will by Gods Word what it is, that</hi> Moſes <hi>is to have them both; we will let that paſs as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of fleſh and blood, and think that which God think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be moſt convenient.</hi> And hence he infers, that in reſpect of this ſole and ſupreme power the Church or Congregation muſt not come uncalled, or refuſe to come when called; that is, muſt not act againſt, or without him,

the notion of Reformation cried up and alledged, but alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in the State, and thoſe that are in rule therein, is really brought in. If we do but reflect on ſome more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable paſſages among our ſelves, we may, from that ſmal difference which was in the <hi>ſix Articles</hi> themſelves from the <hi>Roman</hi> Doctrine, well conclude, that the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Popes power as Head of the Church here, was more aimed at then truth of Religion; inſomuch as a diſpenſation was ready to be granted for every thing, ſave for taking the Oath of Supremacy.

Theſe things being ſo, we need not wonder why firſt that notion of uſurpation, or to uſurp, properly ſignifying often uſing onely, and taken as well in a good as bad ſence, when applied to other things, ſhould always import evil, when applied to the eaſe before re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>2 And onward, upon the ſame deſign again we may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the reaſon why few or none ſhould ſet down in plain terms, that it was lawful for men to obey him that was an Uſurper; for however the thing might have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived true, yet it might be apprehended an incouragement or abatement to the odium of ſuch as ſhould attempt the like.

Nay, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed if it ſhould be granted, that he that hath poſſeſſion, and thereby prejudiced anothers right, cannot therefore claim obedience from thoſe that ſtand by juſt relation ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to that place of power which he holdeth, then truly for want of actual power ſo to do, all acts of Juſtice done and enforced in his name as Prince, would be but Tyranny in him, however they might have been lawfully executed by another. From the evil conſequents and effects of theſe two opinions, the Monarchs of Chriſtendom are ſeldom free; the notions of <hi>Pope</hi> or <hi>People,</hi> and the power be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to them, being by diſcontented parties ſtill urged as a juſt cauſe of their diſturbance.</p>
               <p>3. A third ſort that make uſe of this ſcandalous name of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper,</hi> are of ſuch, who in favor to ſome particular perſon only, now out of poſſeſſion, would, upon the alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of his right to govern, inſtigate thoſe that are actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Subjects to him, to withdraw their allegiance, and give it to him that is not poſſeſſed at all: without regard to that publike diſturbance which muſt thereupon enſue. And this doctrine hath leſs of reaſon to plead for it ſelf then the other two. For firſt, they do it on the behalf of a whole Society of men, or ſome eminent Officers amongſt them whom they would have preferred before this one perſon now poſſeſſed: And then they alleadge for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves both Laws of Reaſon and Natural equity, and alſo poſitive Divine Conſtitutions, to ſhew that this power was by ſuch original right veſted in them, and therefore that no particular Sanction can deprive them of it. Whereas the other, as they would have whole Societies of men ruined and diſturbed by Civil war, only to prefer and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance one ſingle Perſon or Family before another, (who in reference to the State is as like to rule well, as he or his) ſo have they no allegation for it but ſome particular and private Laws, made at the inſtance of, and during the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of this perſon or his family: When as in truth, ſince in poſitive Edicts made by unequal authority, the laſt
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:55989:53"/>
is to ſtand and to be obſerved, they ſhould of right be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by theſe preſent Conſtitutions that do authoriſe the party in poſſeſſion, and not thoſe that are now abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated and bereft of their force; even as that perſon or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily they were made by and for, are bereft of their power.</p>
               <p>4. If we ſhall apply theſe things to our ſelves in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and examine how they have been generally reſented by that part which was in that reſpect juſtly called the Royaliſt or Cavalier; we ſhall find all three ſorts by them condemned as contrary to them in their original principles, which were, maintenance of Peace and Monarchy. The firſt two they oppoſed and went againſt as matters of fact, and which did already make diſturbance: when as there being then no fear how diſturbance would be made by claim the other way, and finding many Laws in force to continue their obedience to him in poſſeſſion, they did uſually inveigh not only againſt all Uſurpation in attempt, but alſo againſt all right to poſſeſs and continue; the more to affright from, and diſcountenance ſuch undertakings. In which laſt reſpect of lawfulneſs to poſſeſs or continue, they muſt ſtill be underſtood to intend that Right which is to be conſidered in relation to the party diſpoſſeſſed; againſt whom, and to whoſe prejudice (if he had right) he is only in reaſon to be taken as an unlawful Diſſeiſor. And therefore they might, by theſe or the like imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, be ſuppoſed to hope, that ſince in him was the fault of entrance whereby publike peace was diſturbed, and it being in his power only by his quiet reſignation to do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal right again, without civil war and blood, that for his farther incitement thereunto, they would alſo inſinuate ſome unlawfulneſs to thoſe acts of obedience which ſhal be done unto him by ſuch as are now actually his Subjects.</p>
               <p>5. To which end, and none other, we may well apply that additional Expreſſion of the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſet down, viz <hi>On what head that Crown ought to ſtand, none can be ignorant.</hi> For having before, <hi>pag.</hi> 7. alleadged the Act made 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 1. for <hi>reſtoring to the Crown the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent

juriſdiction in things Eccleſiaſtical,</hi> they may by <hi>that</hi> Crown be well conceived to mean that Eccleſiaſtical au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority which thereto belonged: And ſo not only to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare againſt that uſurpation of power which the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then took in their enacting in ſuch matters, whilſt the Crown (and conſequently the power) did and ought to continue in him that was ſtill reigning and actually poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed; but they might, in duty alſo to the ſettlement and ſecurity of their preſent Prince, as well as the ſetling of the peace of the Nation, have an aim hereby to prevent all attempt towards perſonal uſurpation, by implying that that Crown ought not to be on any head but his who now wore it. But what if no ſuch Head be? Muſt not the Crown be worne? Yes ſure: For as they had before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited that Act whereby this Authority ſhould <hi>be for ever united and annexed to the Imperial Crown of this Realm;</hi> ſo can we not reaſonably preſume it their meaning, that thoſe Juriſdictions which ſhould be of continual uſe and <hi>for ever</hi> annexed to the Imperial Crown of this Realm, ſhould be underſtood ſo limited to any one perſon or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, as, in defailance of their wearing of it, (which muſt be ſuppoſed ſubject to humane chance and caſualty) the Church ſhould be deprived of that uſeful power.</p>
               <p>6. In like manner are we to underſtand Biſhop <hi>Andrews</hi> and all other, in their writings againſt Uſurpation; that is, intending thereby ſo much more to confirm Subjects obedience to their preſent Prince. For, they then ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that againſt him no ſuch thing would be objected, and on the other ſide, fearing that Tyranny or any other crime which he might fall into might be alleadged as a juſt excuſe for inſubjection, they did what they would to make the firſt odious, and theſe tolerable. In which doing, ſince their aim was <hi>good,</hi> they may be apprehended (out of duty) to be rather officiouſly, then truly guided in many of their expreſſions that way made; and that, as they did but hereby intend the more to conform obedience to him under whoſe power they then lived, ſo to be exemplar
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:55989:54"/>
herein to others; without permitting ſuch as were now Subjects to do evil, that good may come of it; to wrong their<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> own conſciences by diſobedience, that another may be righted in his private Title. And if we look in that Sermon of Biſhop <hi>Andrews</hi> made of <hi>giving Caeſar his due,</hi> we ſhall find him acknowledging as much; for (ſaith he) <hi>fol 91. What Caeſar was this, for whoſe intereſt Chriſt thus pleadeth? It was</hi> Tiberius, <hi>even he under whom our Saviour was (and knew he was to be) put to death; a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger from</hi> Iſrael, <hi>a Heathen man, uncircumciſed, an Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, an enemy to the truth,</hi> &amp;c. Where you ſee that obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and tribute is directed to be paid to one that was as great a ſtranger to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as great an Uſurper in any legal power there, as <hi>Nimrod</hi> could be. And however <hi>Nimrod</hi> might be thought in other things to equal him, yet ſince he had no hand in putting our Saviour to death, we may well think that though it were unlawful for ſuch as <hi>Nimrod</hi> thus to riſe or reign, yet did he not intend it lawfull for Subjects to diſobey, when thus up and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
               <p>7. So that to take them, and all other in like ſort, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their right meaning (that is, to be conſtant in their direct reſpect to the common peace and benefit of the whole Society of men, without ſuch partial eye to the favor of any particular perſon or family, as to abe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> what ſhall be contrary thereunto) we are to conceive, that as they had pitched upon Monarchy, as that which by Divine and humane light was fitteſt to accompliſh this end, even ſo it was not to be ſuppoſed they would be ſo forgetful of their firſt original ground, as to invalidate that uſe and benefit which by Monarchy was to be expected; ſo as to give leave to Subjects to thruſt him out again, as often as the Monarch ſhould not have been to their likeing; for this had been to overthrow that whole foundation they had before built upon, to wit, continual peace, by conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual ſubmiſſion to the preſent Monarch. Whereas if any party of the Subjects might take upon them to withdraw
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:55989:54"/>
obedience when they thought their Governour defective in Title<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then, ſince it ſhould ſeldom happen but that there might be ſome objections in that reſpect made by ſome diſcontented party or another, it would alſo follow, that for want of conſtant means how peace and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould for every time preſent be preſerved, that courſe which they had deſigned, whereby it ſhould be continually and at all times preſerved, would contradict it ſelf, and come to nothing. And therefore having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured that this peace, as they thought, ſhould never be interrupted, even by the courſe formerly mentioned, that is, laying ſo great imputation, and leaving ſuch ſmall hopes of enjoyment on thoſe that ſhould attempt it, they were leſs regardful to ſpeak of any way to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken after it was interrupted, and the publick peace now ſetled in another hand, leſt by any expreſs allowance of a lawful obedience to him afterwards, they ſhould (as we ſaid) ſeem to caſt more hopes and encouragements upon ſuch like enterpriſes. And that their intentions hereby were onely to deter from ſuch ambitious riſing, and not from giving obedience to any in poſſeſſion, we ſhall not find that any name of odium is found out, and given to ſuch as live in ſubjection to Uſurpers; which doubtleſs they would have done, had they conceived them as guilty in their obedience, as he in his entrance or command.</p>
               <p>8. And if we ſhall appeal to matter of fact, we ſhall find the Cavalier party all along conſtant to the ſure way of preſervation of publick peace, by their adherence to the party poſſeſſed, and by oppoſing of ſuch, as would upon the allegation of Uſurpation, or want of title in him or his Anceſtors, or for want of Election or Authority de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from the people, make all his commands and rule unlawful. And in order to this, was that maxime ſo often found in the mouths of that party, at ſuch time as many perſonal defects and imputations were laid to the charge of the late King, <hi>That the Crown was to be obeyed and fought
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:55989:55"/>
for, although it ſtood upon a May-Pole;</hi> Which ſpeech, as it had been taken from the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> ſo was it by him uſed in defence of his Loyalty to his preſent Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, whom the other party called both Tyrant &amp; Uſurper<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>9. And if we do impartially look upon the reaſon and ground of all Politick Conſtitutions of this kind. We ſhall find all contrary conſtruction to ariſe from miſtake or prejudice. For firſt, is there any thing more available to the continuance of publick peace, then that ſubmiſſion ſhould be continued to the Monarch in poſſeſſion? And then that there might be one always in poſſeſſion, ſo as to make uſe of this ſubmiſſion, and that without danger of publick diſturbance, through ſtrife about the perſon to enjoy it, was it not again neceſſary, that by publick Edict it ſhould be beforehand appointed to whom it ſhould ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, that all might be more deter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>David,</hi> will it not ſtill rationally and equitably follow, that the poſſeſſor ſhould have moſt right of any to have this entail ſetled on his Family? and do we not accordingly find that all Nations that have due regard to future peace and quiet, have joyned with the poſſeſſor in ſetling it accordingly? and will it not onward ſtill follow, that in order to maintain the firſt Principles, we ſhould be loyal to the Family ſo ſetled, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But then again, will it not from the ſame Principles ſtill follow, that in caſe my loyal en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors ſhall not have their wiſhed ſucceſs, but that the other party ſhall ſet up another Monarch, and that in ſuch full poſſeſſion as now to be quietly and generally ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to, as in the Seat of Juſtice, (the Laws being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted in his name, as they were in the others before) that

               <p>10. If we ſhall examine the grounds and intentions of our own fundamental conſtitutions concerning this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Governors, therein we ſhall find them to be the ſame: Namely, the deſign of peace by ſubmiſſion to the preſent Monarch, without regard to the ſtile of King, or Family of which he was of. And to this end it may be obſerved, that in the Act made in <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighths time, wherein his Supremacy is aſſerted, it is ſet down 24. <hi>Hen. 8. c.</hi> 12.

As for the firſt, I conceive that if King and Parliament ſhould enact that this Government ſhould be a Monarchy no longer, it would be void, not onely as contrary to the Law of God and Reaſon, but as a thing without their juriſdiction, even as overthrowing that power whereby themſelves had power, or that fundamental Rule or Law whereby them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were made Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> makers.

                  </gap>n caſe he be either naturally or politickly dead, and thoſe that were his Subjects become the Subjects of another, then the fundamental Law that aims at continuance of peace by continuance of Monarchy, muſt in like manner be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to determine the ſubjection and obedience to this preſent poſſeſſor and his Family. Want of due conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration whereof, we ſhall find one of the chief grounds why ſome of more conſciencious ſort, as well of thoſe that have, as have not been of that party, are ſo hardly drawn to conceive right of things of this nature; and alſo for want of due diſtinction and differencing of that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which through alteration of time, may come to make the ſame perſon to contract a different guilt in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into this place of power, over it is in the execution of it. How a man may be an unlawful intruder in to an Office whereunto a lawful power doth belong, when yet, being poſſeſſed, he is lawfully to be obeyed by all that ſtand ſubjected to thoſe that are in this place of power. For want of which due conſideration, and how thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions and objections uſually made againſt the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

of Government gotten by Uſurpation, are to be, as before noted, differently underſtood in reference to the commander and obeyer, much trouble doth many times ariſe; for he though, he may not lawfully hold the place by authority whereof he doth command, yet ought he lawfully to be obeyed by the authority of that Office which he doth hold.</p>
               <p>11. Two great faults and miſtakes therefore there may be obſerved which do daily adminiſter occaſion of much trouble in things of this nature, by fruſtrating di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and poſitive Edicts of their true intent, through their making ſo great a ſeparation between thoſe that are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily to this end conjoyned, that is, the power and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thereby impowered; for while ſome would have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the power onely, as Gods Ordinance, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out due regard to the perſon, they make the power vain, by leaving no poſſibility whereby it ſhould be reduced into act. Theſe being affected with ſo much ambition or impatience againſt Church or State Rulers, are crying out with <hi>Core</hi> and his company, <hi>You take too much upon you,</hi> and power is in the whole Congregation, in the whole people; by which means they are about to uſurp<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and keep the real execution of power to themſelves, while they leave to others onely the Titles and formalities thereof. And ſome again, having too perſonal regard herein, and ſtriving to make the worth and value of the power depend on their affectionate choyce, do thereupon ſhrewdly hazard, if not wholly defect that true eſteem and benefit which is to be given unto, and expected from this conjunction. Theſe may be reckoned of <hi>Epheſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

in that doubtful claim between the Houſes of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> each party threw it upon the other on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to withdraw the Subjects allegeance from his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary all that he could.

               <p>12. And if we ſeriouſly look into the true ground of theſe aſperſions, we ſhall find both the imputation of <hi>

But elſe to write or ſpeak in the defence of him who by the Law of God and Reaſon, and preſent Law of the Nation is to be ſo acknowledged, and in a caſe too, apparently tending to publike peace and good, is not flattery, but duty: whereas he that out of private or perſonal regard, would, to the plain diſturbance and unſettlement of the State, perſwade to a preſent obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience where there is not a preſent power, may be truly called a Flatterer or Sel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And therefore in ſuch like diſputes as theſe, paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or intereſt will be always ſubject to biaſs and miſlead us in perſonal adherence, if we do not lay aſide our private reſpects, and candidly and conſcionably look back into thoſe true grounds and reaſons why obedience did origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally come to be given to any one man at all; being (as heretofore we ſhewed) Gods glory by mans peace. And this will be found the moſt warrantable and ſureſt way to diſcover unto us that perſon who at any time is to have it. And to this end I have judged it a well-grounded Maxim, <hi>Love the King for Peace ſake, and Peace for Gods ſake.</hi> For ſince none but God can be perfectly good, ſo as to be loved for his own ſake only; ſo all other things being good but <hi>ſuo modo,</hi> or according to their relation, and that ſerviceableneſs and benefit they afford to other things (that ſtand his creatures and witneſſes of his goodneſs and glory amongſt us) they muſt ſtill be perſonally loved and reſpected according to ſuch their preſent relations: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as thoſe that want that relation, cannot, out of any ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate reſpect and value that is in themſelves be eſteemed right objects of that love and reſpect which is only due in regard of the relation it ſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in reference to that neceſſary conjunction which is to
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:55989:58"/>
be upheld in the union of the perſon with the power, 'tis wel to be obſerved how God <hi>hath joyned theſe two together</hi> to the intent that no man, through intereſt or prejudice, ſhould put them aſunder. For where he enjoins ſubjection to the <hi>Higher Power as his ordinance,</hi> and ſets forth the penalty of doing otherwiſe; he preſently denotes it to be perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally due, by ſubjecting us to thoſe that are <hi>Rulers: For Rulers are not a terror to good works, but to evil;</hi> that is, they being poſſeſſed of this power, are to be expected juſt avengers of Reſiſtance, therefore called evil, becauſe the cauſe of ſo much evil. And then when it after follows, <hi>Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou ſhalt have praiſe of the ſame;</hi> it is preſently appropriate to that perſon which God in his providence hath ſet over us: <hi>For he</hi> (that is, this perſon) <hi>is the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of God to thee for thy good;</hi> that is, Gods Deacon or Vicegerent in preſervation of Peace by means of this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.

And that Text eſpecially, where we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded

to <hi>fear God and the King, and not to meddle with thoſe that are given to change;</hi> will be expreſſed in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the King or perſon in preſent power and poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: For why elſe ſhould we be forbidden to ſeek to change him, or meddle, or joyn with them that would do ſo, in ſuch unlimited words? If to ſeek to change by way of ſedition, had been thought lawful for Subjects, upon any ground, by him that ſaid, <hi>That againſt the King there is no riſing up,</hi> then ſurely this precept was very wrong put; eſpecially not having any ſuch exception; for rather the word <hi>not</hi> ſhould have been left out, and the precept have been, <hi>Meddle with them that would change,</hi> or are ſeditious towards it; for ſedition muſt precede change in that kind.</p>
               <p>15. And if we do not carry an equal and impartial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to perſons dignified by Gods Ordinance, we ſhew plainly we have no reſpect to his Ordinance at all, but would have it an Ordinance of our own: When as the power thereby claimed, is to be at no time of value with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our approbation; and by this means fall within the compaſs of Saint <hi>James</hi> his reproof, <hi>To have the faith of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt with reſpect of perſons.</hi> For, as in his inſtance, if thoſe that are unequal in worldly honor or title, are yet equally to be reſpected as they ſtand equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our Chriſtian Brethren; ſo alſo, ſuch as are now in power, are, for their power ſake, and for the honor of him that ordained it, to be equally reſpected and obeyed, however there might be a greater ſhare of outward world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly title in one man then another. So then we may ſee the way to be a conſtant Royaliſt, is to be a conſtant Loyaliſt; not to reſpect the power or place for the perſons ſake, but the perſon for the place and power ſake: And thereby, according to our duty having reſpect to God and his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, before our own. If we do not this, he that to day was Loyal, may to morrow be brought turn Rebel and Traytor, through that change of Families which ſtories do tell us have in this thruſt out one another.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:55989:59"/>17. But ſome would make Preſcription the onely way to lawfulneſs in poſſeſſions of things of this nature, as well as it is for ſilencing of Claims between Subjects in their private poſſeſſions; but ſince they have not yet, nor can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, upon any true ground, agree in limiting of this time, it argues the thing it ſelf to be but a fruitleſs invention: For although towards the ending of Suits and Quarrels, each State and Kingdom do, by Laws of its own, prefix a certain time in which poſſeſſion ſhall in certain caſes be a good plea in it ſelf againſt all other, yet this Law being poſitive, bears always an exception to the Law-maker him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as having continual power to right himſelf and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in caſe of equity; according to that maxim, <hi>Nullum tempus occurrit Regi.</hi> And therefore although it may be available to ſilence private titles in regard of a ſuperior power to appoint it, and ſee it executed accordingly, yet it will not thereupon follow, that Subjects may fancy any ſuch Laws to bind their Prince by. And therefore when queſtions of this kind ſhall ariſe for confirmation of Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers themſelves, I know not any Superior under God himſelf, who ſhall aſcertain this preſcription, and ſee it executed accordingly. And if we but mark the thing it ſelf, in its original riſe and ground, we ſhall find them gain-ſaying themſelves, and laying that very firſt poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which they diſallow, for a foundation of that which they would have to be right afterwards. For in ſuch vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of times preſcribed, ſuppoſe it ſhould be a Hundred years; when, and where muſt we begin to accompt? Muſt it be from the firſt day of the parties ſecret plotting or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to get into this place of power? How ſhall that be truly known? And if you leave that out of the compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of unlawful action, which was moſt of all ſo, and begin to compute it from the time of poſſeſſion, then ſhall we want a Judge to ſtate when that did preciſely begin; and thereupon when it ſhall take end, ſo as to ſay to the Subjects, <hi>The Hundred years are now out, you have all this while been ſubject for wraths ſake onely, now you muſt

                  </hi> Thus they that deny right of obedience to the poſſeſſor, do yet derive right from poſſeſſion, and by conſequent, grant it to be due thereunto. And ſurely if men had had that due regard to publick peace which they ſhould, and in reſpect whereto it might be thought that they had prefixed a time to ſilence diſputes of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they would not then have ſo far lengthened it, as to paſs that limit, wherein it was not ſuppoſable, that the diſpoſſeſſed ſhould continue at all, or in ſuch repute o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>17. Again, Will they make one prefixed time ſerve for legitimating the Government of all new Families, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that great difference in right to claim, and way of entry that may be obſerved in them? they then become unjuſt: If they make difference, then who ſhall be Judge concerning him who ſhall really be eſteemed an Uſurper, amidſt that great partiality which intereſt or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy uſeth to caſt that way, as well for making Uſurpers that are not, as acquiting thoſe that are ſo; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, for aggravating or leſſening the faults of ſuch as are?</p>
               <p>18. If we think of ſome foraign power, as that of the Pope, or the like, to undertake in this kind, as he hath ſometime done, how ſhall we do for another to place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove him again, to ſee that particular ſpleen or intereſt have not made him partial alſo: So far as to make <hi>Charls Martel</hi> and his Son lawful poſſeſſors, notwithſtanding known precedent uſurpation, even while he was Maſter of the Palace; and on the other ſide, to call King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, who was an Hereditary poſſeſſor, an Uſurper, while he acknowledged not him for Supream?</p>

                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:55989:60" rendition="simple:additions"/>19. Will they put it to Subjects themſelves to judge whether their Prince be at all, and how far, and in what degree an Uſurper, to the end that they may know whether, or how far obedience is to be given unto him? What hope of agreement in their Verdict? Nay, is it not the ſure way to ſet them at diſagreement, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to introduce Civil War? for ſince he ſhould not at all have been poſſeſſed, if the wills and power of thoſe that oppoſed him, as wanting title, could have prevailed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the greater number or power of ſuch as elected and helped him in, how then can we imagine that theſe ſhould now not onely let go their ſuperior power herein, which they have all this while contended for, but alſo ſubmit that equal vote they have as Subjects, to be overborn and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced by the deſires of their enemies, in the dethroning their friend, and admiſion of a known adverſary into ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme power over them; who by their paſt oppoſition, they muſt now expect alſo to be heightned with thoughts of revenge?</p>
               <p>20. Is it not therefore much better, and more becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch, as have any real love to the peace and welfare of the Church and State where they live, to labour to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh and free themſelves from private and perſonal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects and prejudices, and ingeniouſly to examine all things accordiong to their prime intention and aim, which is preſervation of God glory, by preſervation of men; and preſervation of men, by preſervation of publick peace and agreement? What and if (for reaſons before ſet down) ſome have not ſo plainly aſſerted obedience and loyalty to an Uſurper as they have to a Tyrant? can we yet other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe think then, that as their intention was to preſerve peace in this caſe to the publick, notwithſtanding the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick it ſelf muſt therein ſuffer; even ſo, and much more muſt we imagine, that in this other caſe, where onely one perſon or Family doth ſuffer, that yet they ſhould leave men at liberty to make diſturbance in the publick, as often as paſſion or intereſt ſhould furniſh Subjects with
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:55989:60"/>
occaſion of ſuch imputation? No certainly; had they meant that the Subjects of any Prince now peaceably ſetled might under colour of Uſurpation withdraw their allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, they would not then have ſo firmly aſſerted that this allegiance was due to Tyrants; ſince that, as formerly ſaid, can never be practiſed without Uſurpation, and that in a more continued and high meaſure, and alſo accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with more pernicious and dangerous conſequents then in the other. For whereas a new Prince is called U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurper, for breaking the Law made in behalf of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed in particular, doth not the Tyrant much more break and tranſcend thoſe Laws, and the Laws of God and Nature alſo, in what he doth in detriment to the publike? And doth he not daily repeat the ſame breach, and newly violate them, as often as he doth tyranniſe? Whereas Uſurpation conſiſteth only in one act, againſt one ſingle perſon or family of the whole, and is not daily proſecuted like the other, to the detriment of all in general. Let us not therefore invert the prime intention of Laws, and make that deſtructive to Peace, which was purpoſely framed to preſerve it; by the wilful miſtake of their meaning, that ſeem to aſcribe unlawfulneſs to the rule of Uſurpers, or poſſeſſion of Uſurpers. And this we ſhall beſt do, if we do but reflect on that different condition the ſame perſon is to be look'd upon in relation to that Prince or family he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth or diſpoſſeſſeth, and in relation to the reſt of the Subjects and Nation; and this alſo in reference to what ſhall be by him done before he is poſſeſſed, over what it is afterward.</p>
               <p>21. While any one is attempting thus to enter, he is doubtleſs to be oppoſed by both Prince and people, as an Enemy not only to the Prince himſelf, but to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weal alſo in diſturbing their peace and quiet: And being not yet ſeiſed of any ſuch place of power as to make his acts or commands warrantable, there is nothing which is by him done in a politick capacity can be called lawful. But if the Tables be now turned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and he quietly ſeated in the Legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:55989:61"/>
power, as the other was before, then are the Subjects to turn themſelves in their obedience too, and having ſtill reſpect to Gods ordinance and the publick quiet, continue on the ſame peace, by a dutiful ſubmiſſion to him that is now <hi>Dei gratia</hi> or by Divine providence brought into that authority, which the other did claim <hi>Dei gratia</hi> before: When yet the perſon thus entred, if he be not throughly ſatisfied in the right of his poſſeſſion, ſtands before God accomptable for the injury done to the diſpoſſeſſed, and what elſe ſhall happen in his regiment. In which reſpect, as his poſſeſſion it ſelf, ſo the commands thereby impoſed, may well be unlawful as to the Impoſer, but cannot be ſo eſteemed in the Obeyer: He may be called Uſurper by the diſpoſſeſſed, in reference to the place by which he is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered; but is not by the Subjects to be ſo thought in the execution of what is proper thereunto: They are to look to Poſſeſſion as an evidence of Right in it ſelf; for are not all mens Eſtates elſe called by that name? do we not ſay, Such and ſuch men are men of great Poſſeſſions? And if Subjects ſhall be put to guide their obedience and loyalty by other dark evidences, who ſhall ſhew them and expound them but parties intereſſed? and how ſhall they agree in them? Do we not, for peace ſake, ſay in other things, that <hi>Poſſeſſion is eleven points of the Law?</hi> And will it not in this much more follow, that it ſhould be all twelve? There one part is left open and free, becauſe Appeal to the Law-maker may make alteration: But there being in this caſe no Superior on earth, it is to paſs as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by God alſo, till he in his providence ſhall make alteration.</p>
               <p>22. If this courſe ſhould not hold, but their obedience and loyalty ſhould not be lawful, if the Prince were not lawfully ſeiſed or made ſo by preſcription, there would ſeldom any time happen, in any Nation amidſt thoſe many changes of Families, wherein Subjects could warrantably obey, for want thereof. It was not, I am ſure, the practice and opinion of Chriſtians formerly: They, as they lived

                  </gap>s and examples, in ſubjection to the parties poſſeſſed of thoſe higher powers they lived under. If they ſhould have underſtood S. <hi>Pauls</hi> injunction of ſubjection to the <hi>Powers that are,</hi> to have no enforcement upon the conſcience of any that could not be perſwaded his preſent Prince or Emperor came in as a lawful Succeſſor, or by lawful election; how could they have been at all times noted for ſuch conſtant Loyaliſts, notwithſtanding there were very few, but either in their entry balked the electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and approbation of the Senate or people, which at firſt were held only lawful authorities, and as much afterwards tranſgreſſed the rule of hereditary ſucceſſion, by bringing in new families. In which caſes, although to the eyes of all men it was apparent, that force or craft ſet upon their preſent Soveraigns; yet would not they forget their duty of loyalty to him, however their Prince might have forgot to do juſtice to another. And if to this end we ſhall but look to our Stories, we ſhall find cauſe enough to retract this opinion of Diſobedience, being contrary to the ſenſe and practice of our loyal Anceſtors. We will begin but from the Conqueſt, becauſe beſt known, although more ſhifting have been before.</p>

               <p>28. In the next, <hi>Henry</hi> the Second begins a new family, and in him indeed may we may find the firſt true uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for his own ſons are taking upon them ſoveraign power, their father yet living and poſſeſſed.</p>

               <p>83. <hi>Henry the Seventh</hi> ſucceeds; but he, not taking to himſelf Kingly power till he were in full poſſeſſion, is not called Uſurper: Although his title was not ſo good as the others, (whom we are however to expect to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Uſurper and Tyrant alſo, the more to dignifie the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther now in poſſeſſion) when as yet, although the ſaid <hi>Richard</hi> were an Uſurper as to his Nephews, he was none to him. Again, although <hi>Richard</hi> were dead, yet were there others living, and in <hi>England</hi> too, of a far more lineal and legal claim to the Crown, as was the Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> Daughter to <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, and the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> Son to the elder Brother of King <hi>Richard, George</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> to whom and his Heirs the Crown was alſo by Parliament given by <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, in caſe he ſhould die without iſſue, as he did.

               <p>41.

How comes it to paſs that the Laws made by theſe ſeveral Princes, nay by <hi>Richard the Third</hi> himſelf, are acknowledged for Laws of force?

               </p>
               <p>42 Find we any in all this Liſt of Kings, and ſtory of changings amongſt them that left his ſtile and claim of <hi>Dei gratiâ</hi> or divine providence, and ſtood upon that of lawful ſucceſſion; when they do ſtill all along write themſelves <hi>Henry, Edward,</hi> or the like, <hi>By the Grace of God King of England, &amp;c.</hi> not mentioning at all their Fathers or Progenitors name, or the deſcent by which they did at firſt claim: What is this (I ſay) but plainly to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence to us, that the beſt evidence of their right and tenure, as Gods Vicegerents, is that atteſtation of his Providence, whereby they have been enabled to attain this poſſeſſion? Towards the Attainment of which, the ſame providence doth ordinarily make uſe of ſucceſſion, until he hath ſome notable work to do; and then, ſometimes of election, by <hi>bowing the hearts of the people,</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of conqueſt, as <hi>Lord of Hoſts.</hi> Yet can I never find that however thoſe that were to enter, for ſtrengthning of their party and adherents, were ready to make uſe of popular exclamations againſt Uſurpers, and to do their beſt to have it beleeved, that the poſſeſſor was ſo, yet (as I ſaid) they, being in poſſeſſion, ſtuck to that claim above all other.

               <p>43. So that we find, that however Princes are, in pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, willing to omit no claim that may make for their admiſſion or ſecurity, and that eſpecially at their firſt entrance; yet is ſeiſure and poſſeſſion held ever to be the ſteadieſt ſupport; nay, ſuch it is in the expreſs verdict of Law it ſelf. To which end I ſhall here inſert the opinion of him that (by Lawyers themſelves) hath been accounted the <hi>Oracle of the Law</hi> ſince, in fuller confirmation of that Maxim before ſet down: And that is the reſolution of my Lord <hi>Coke,</hi> who, in the third Book of his <hi>Inſtitutes, f.</hi> 7, 8. in the Title of <hi>Treaſon,</hi> expounding the words of <hi>N<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>re Seignior le Roy,</hi> ſays, <hi>that by</hi> le Roy <hi>is to be underſtood a King regnant, and not of one that hath but the name of a King.</hi> And then alſo he alleadges the inſtance of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> on whom, as having indeed the ſoveraign power, the word <hi>le Roy</hi> was appropriate, although ſhe were a woman, and her husband at the ſame time ſtiled <hi>King of England.</hi> And that the ſtile or title alters not the reſpect and obedience due from Subjects to Soveraigns, more then it doth from Children to the Maſter or Father, (in which reſpect a Yeoman is as abſolute in his relation as a Lord) may appear (beſides) in that inſtance of our Kings hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſoveraignty of <hi>Ireland</hi> under the title of <hi>Lords,</hi> and not as <hi>Kings,</hi> till of late times; during which ſpace they had certainly as great authority as afterwards, and the Subjects there were in the ſame caſes made Rebels or
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:55989:66"/>
Traitors to him as Lord, as afterwards to him as King. Afterward he quotes in the margent, the Statute of 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. enacting, <hi>That none ſhall be condemned for any thing done in obedience to the preſent King or Soveraign,</hi> (for ſo the words of the Statute are, <hi>King or Soveraign)</hi> He further ſaith, <hi>This Act is to be underſtood of a King in poſſeſſion of the Crown and Kingdom; for if there be a King regnant in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, although he be</hi> Rex de facto, &amp; non de jure, <hi>yet is he</hi> Seignior le Roy <hi>within the</hi> purview <hi>of this Statute; and the other that hath right, and is out of poſſeſsion, is not within this Act<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nay, if Treaſon be committed againſt a King</hi> de facto, &amp; non de jure, <hi>and after the King</hi> de jure <hi>cometh to the Crown, he ſhall puniſh the Treaſon done to the King</hi> de facto; <hi>and a Pardon granted by a King</hi> de jure, <hi>that is not alſo</hi> de facto, <hi>is void.</hi> By all which it will appear, that the Law directs our fidelity to <hi>N<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>re Seignior,</hi> our <hi>Soveraign Lord,</hi> not confining it to the ſtile of <hi>le Roy</hi> or <hi>King,</hi> to whom it is only due as being actually <hi>N<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>re Roy, our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Lord the King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>44. By which we may ſee, that the intention of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and Fundamental Law of the Land was not, by proper Acts made at the inſtance of, and in favor to particular perſons and their families, to overthrow that firſt main de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of Publike peace, which was ſought by appointment of a Succeſſor in the Government. The which becauſe it was to be ſuppoſed to come to the Heir of the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor, therefore were Subjects ſworne <hi>to Him, his Heirs and Succeſſors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> ſtill intending that it is not due to the Heir only as Heir, if he be not alſo <hi>Succeſſor.</hi> For if ſo, why did not the Oath of Allegiance and Supremacie run as Grants of Land, and of other inferior Offices of Power, <hi>To him and his Heirs,</hi> if none but his true Heir muſt be obeyed after his death or removal? And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Law, by putting down that word of <hi>Succeſſor,</hi> did (doubtleſs) determine, that obedience ſhould go along with poſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſſion, as before noted.</p>
               <p>45. The Laws, you ſee, having publick regard, will not
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:55989:67"/>
be abuſed with theſe miſapplied terms of Uſurper, or the like, which paſſion or intereſt (as heretofore noted) had politickly ſometimes wreſted to ſerve as a ſnare to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw obedience from the perſon already in power, when it was only due to him that did attempt to diſpoſſeſs him. And therefore they uſe not the term of Uſurper more in this then other caſes, where he that takes poſſeſſion of any thing by fraud or force, is not called Uſurper, but Diſſeiſor, or the like; even as here he is called a King by fact. They knew well enough how to put a difference between the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality of their commands that are Uſurpers, while they were uſurping; and theirs that are now Poſſeſſors, although they were once Uſurpers. While they are in their act of uſurpation, they are to be reſiſted not only as oppoſers of publick quiet, but of the Crown and dignity of the preſent Prince, which, in conſcience as well as by oath, we are bound to maintain. But then, if it happen that the Crown and dignity do by providence fall to him that was Uſurper be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the ſame conſideration of duty and publick peace muſt enjoin us to loyalty where the Crown and dignity is; all actors to his diſturbance muſt be now reſiſted as Uſurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. For as the Oath of Allegiance did perſonally before paſs in relation to that Regal power he or his had, or were like to have; ſo when the perſon or family comes to be changed, it muſt be preſumed to paſs in reaſon to thoſe that ſhall be now poſſeſſed of thoſe Regal powers to which it is due.</p>

Nay, if poſſeſſion give not to Princes right to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand their Subjects alſo, I ſee not how <hi>David,</hi> in that <hi>ſeven years war between the houſe of</hi> Saul <hi>and his,</hi> 2 Sam. 3. 1. could be excuſed of that oath he made to him <hi>of not cutting off his ſeed after him,</hi> 1 Sam. 24 21, 22.
