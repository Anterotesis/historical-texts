            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <head>CHAP. I. <hi>The Introduction.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have conſidered the noble Problem tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Gravitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Non-gravita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Fluids upon the Bodies ſubjected to them: And of thoſe ſeveral So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions and Suppoſitions touching the ſame, given by the great Wits of latter Ages, which I ſhall in their due place, more particularly examine.</p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:96771:5"/>
               <p>And I muſt needs commend the Induſtrie of this latter Age, in the inventing and exhibiting of very choice Experiments, as in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to ſome other Philoſophical Eſſays, ſo in particular, touching this Phenomenon of the <hi>Gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation or Non-gravitation of Flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ids.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But yet I muſt further add, that though their Experiments herein have been ſearched out, and formed with great Ingenuity, Induſtry, Curioſity and Expence; yet their Solutions of them, and the Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions and Reaſons whereunto they have reduced them, have been (in my underſtanding) very unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory and inevident, if not wholly untrue and inexplicable,</p>
               <p>And the reaſons hereof ſeem to be principally theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. That men have pre-ingaged themſelves and their judgments in the aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:96771:5"/>and maintainance of certain preconceived Hypotheſes and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples which they have invented, and are therefore extreamly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to, and unwilling to hear or receive any thing that may ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Labour herein vain and fruitleſs. And upon that account, have, not without much partiality, miſapplyed and miſappropriated their Experiments and the Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of them, in favour of ſuch Hypotheſes as they have once in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented or entertained, and with too much prejudice, reject any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Solutions, that may either o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow, or at leaſt not gratify ſuch preconceived ſuppoſitions. 2. That men have not ſtrictly enough conſidered of the Nature of Gravitations, and the Reaſon thereof. 3. That they have not enough taken into conſideration thoſe ſeveral accidental (as I may
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:96771:6"/>call them) Interventions that abate, impede, advance, or direct the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation of Bodies, though in themſelves heavy, and tending to the Centre.</p>
               <p>I do not intend to make a full Tract concerning Gravity or Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation; thoſe that mind to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble themſelves therein, may at their leiſure conſult thoſe Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Men that have written at large of this ſubject, as <hi>Archimedes de inſidentibus humido. Merſenius,</hi> and <hi>Stevinus</hi> their Hydroſtaticks; and although I cannot ſubſcribe to all that the two latter have written in this ſubject, yet I muſt needs ſay, that I think little of moment hath been added to their Principles and Demonſtrations by later Writers, only ſome new Experiments have been added by later Writers, bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom'd upon the Doctrin and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments of theſe Ancients.</p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:96771:6"/>
               <p>I ſhall therefore direct all I have to ſay principally to this one mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or point, namely, the Gravita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or non-Gravitation of Fluids upon ſubjected Bodies, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and reaſons of this <hi>Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And though it may poſſibly happen, that what I ſay herein may as little ſatisſie others, as their ſuppoſitions have ſatisfied me. And though my Explications of my thoughts herein, and the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my Experiments thereunto may not be ſo clear and well wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as others of this Subject have been, yet I have this Apology for theſe defects; 1. That what I now write, though it hath been long upon my thoughts, was written <hi>raptim</hi> and haſtily. 2. That I do not know that the Path I walk herein was ever before troden by any elſe. 3. It is but an Eſſay, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:96771:7"/>took not up many hours in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and will take up much leſs in reading thereof.</p>
               <p>And this I premiſe, not to arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate ſingularity to my ſelf, or to pleaſe my ſelf in being the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventor of this Explication; for poſſibly it may fall out, that it may beſcarce worth the owning, when well examined by better Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and poſſibly I my ſelf may retract ſome things in it, upon bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reaſon diſcovered: Yea, and poſſibly it may fall out, that ſome others have had a more early conception of it than my ſelf, and may have dreſſed it in better order; and indeed it would be ſome confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation to me, if it were ſo, though I have not yet known or heard of any ſuch Anticipation.</p>
               <p>I have ſeen many men very confident in the ſuppoſitions which they have found out; and yet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:96771:7"/>on full examination, their miſtakes have been diſcovered: And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I think that I have laid down true ſuppoſitions, yet I will not be over-confident of them; for I may be over partial to my ſelf, as I find others are to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their ſuppoſitions; and it is not the confidence of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, but the Evidence of Reaſon, that prevails with ſober men; and therefore I do propound them but as Eſſays, and ſubmit them to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther examination.</p>
               <p>And the reaſon why I offer it to the publick view is, that better Judgments than my own may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it; and though poſſibly they may not in all things approve it, or the manner of its Explication, yet they may by this opportunity, either improve it if they allow it, or make ſome uſeful ſuperſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon it, for the farther diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:96771:8"/>very of this noble Problem; as Arithmeticians do by the Rule of Falſe Poſition, make true Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions, or at leaſt may deſert the vanity of this or any other opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons formerly offered touching the Solution of this <hi>quaeſitum,</hi> and offer better.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>GRavity if ſelf ſeems to be an Intrinſecal quality of Bodies, whereby they tend down wards to, or to wards the Centre of the Earth.</p>
               <p>I am not here to trouble my ſelf with theſe Philoſophical Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whether there be any other Centre of Gravity than the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre of the Earth for weighty Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies? Nor what is the prime cauſe of deſcent of heavy Bodies, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any Magnetical quality in the Earth, or any forcible ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecal Impreſſion by the Motion of the Heavens, or heavenly Bodies, or that Circumpulſion of other Bodies, that ſome have ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:96771:9"/>or any Intrinſick form of the heavy Bodies themſelves, which is analogical to a vital prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, exerts this power. But it ſerves my turn at this time to call it an Intrinſick Quality of heavy Bodies. Gravitation is either Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it ſelf, or the <hi>conatus</hi> or <hi>niſus admotum;</hi> and therefore it is (that according to that <hi>linea directionis,</hi> whereby, or according to which the Motion of Bodies are directed) not improper to ſay, that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that Line of Direction, theſe Bodies do <hi>gravitare;</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ordinarily the Line of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections of heavy Bodies, naturally is towards the Centre of the Earth in a perpendicular deſcent, which is the ordinary motion of Gravitation, and is greater or leſſer according to the ſtrength, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or allay of this <hi>niſus</hi> or <hi>conatus:</hi> Yet it is not altogether incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:96771:9"/>to ſay, that every thing that hath a <hi>niſus</hi> or <hi>conatus ad motum,</hi> doth in ſome ſort Gravitate accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Degree and Line of ſuch Direction; and thus Fluids, though the primitive Line of the Direction of their Gravitation, may be perpendicular, yet Flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ids have for the moſt part a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Direction or Gravitation o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therways, and ſome Fluids may have an Accidental Gravitation o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therways. For inſtance, Water, though it have its primitive Line of Direction of its motion down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the Centre, yet it hath Lines of Direction of its Motion otherways, as Laterally, or <hi>per de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clive,</hi> and in ſome inſtances <hi>per aſcenſum,</hi> (whereof hereafter,) and conſequently Gravitates every of thoſe ways. For, as I ſaid before, Gravitation is nothing elſe but Motion, or at leaſt <hi>conatus</hi> or <hi>niſus ad motum.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:96771:10"/>
               <p>And therefore it is no real in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruity to ſay, that Fire or Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder doth Gravitate in its Lines of Aſcenſion or Expanſion; that the Bullet, when ſhot upright, doth Gravitate <hi>aſcendendo,</hi> when it is ſhot level it Gravitates <hi>horizon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally,</hi> as long as that force prevails againſt its natural motion of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent.

               </p>
               <p>And therefore it is, that when a weight of 10 or 20l. is in the Scale <hi>A,</hi> and nothing in the Scale <hi>B,</hi> a Percuſſion with a Hand or Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer in the Scale <hi>B,</hi> that moves the Scale <hi>A</hi> with its weight from the Horizontal Plane, wherein it ſtands, is truly ſaid <hi>praegravitare</hi> to the Weight and Scale at <hi>A.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Concerning the Gravitation of Solid Bodies, and their parts.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>IT is moſt certain, that every So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Body, ſeparate from the Earth, hath an actual Preſſure or Gravitation, or <hi>conatus ad motum</hi> towards the Centre of the Earth, as its proper Line of Direction; (I ſpeak not here of the Centre of Gravity of the Bodies themſelves, <hi>de quo vide ſis Galdinum Gondicburl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum, &amp; Stephinum.</hi>) Yea, if a Body be a Fluid Body, yet if it be ſevered from a Body of its own nature by a Veſſel containing it, this Fluid Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in this conſiſtency, obtains the natural rule and reaſon of a Solid Body, conſiſting of the Water and the Veſſel containing it. As, for
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:96771:11"/>inſtance, Water in a Pail or Bucket, as ſo ſtated, hath in it the nature of a Solid Body, and the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation thereof is perpendicular to the Centre, which is its proper Line of Direction. And ſo Air in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in a Bladder, though it ſwims in Water, yet doth Gravitate in ſome meaſure as other Solid Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies do, and deſcends naturally to this Centre: yea a portion of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by it ſelf, being poured out of a Veſſel from the top of a Tower or Steeple, hath its Line of Direction through the Air to the Centre, and will follow and Gravitate in that Line of perpendicular Deſcent. For though it be a Fluid Body in it ſelf, yet relatively to the Air, being a lighter Body, through which it moves, it is in the nature of a Solid Body; and yet in a great Deſcent the Acceleration of its motion, and the renitence of the Air will break
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:96771:11"/>it into Drops or Dew, before it comes to the bottom in a great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent.</p>
               <p>But though Solid Bodies do actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Gravitate, yet if they be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, the parts thereof do not Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitate one upon another, becauſe mutually and mechanically ſuſtei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned one by another, and in a ſtate of Continuity: as a Bowl of Ebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that may weigh 10l, yet the upper Parts or Quarters thereof, whiles in Continuity, do not gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitate upon the lower; for if a hole were bored through the Bowl, yet the upper parts thereof would not gravitate upon the Cavity, for the reaſon before given.</p>
               <p>And therefore the vaſt body of the Earth doth not gravitate upon its own Centre, becauſe though all the parts thereof are perchance not ſimply continued as a Stone or piece of Wood; yet partly by their
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:96771:12"/>mutual Compreſſion one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and partly by the Intervention of the cement of Water, they are <hi>quaſi unum continuum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, if we ſhould ſuppoſe that the vaſt body of the Earth were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into ſeveral ſolid inverted Cones or Pyramids, and that the Centre of the Earth were a leſſer Globe of ſoft Wax or Quick-ſilver, or other ſoft Matter, ſuppoſe a Mile in Diameter; and that each Cone or Pyramid, having a part of the acute end cut off, to be contiguous to this Globe of Wax; yet it were impoſſible that they ſhould preſs or gravitate upon that Globe of Wax, becauſe they would be each ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported one by another, as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by the following Figure.</p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:96771:12"/>
               <figure/>
               <p>
                  <hi>A</hi> the Globe of Wax in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the Earth, <hi>B</hi> the Earth, <hi>c c c</hi> the ſeveral divided inverted Cones. For the upper Baſe of every Cone being larger than the acute part thereof, every Cone will be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by his fellow without any gravitation upon the Clobe, as <hi>A.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea, and it would fall out to be in the ſame manner, though we ſhould ſuppoſe that the Globe of the Earth, which ſome have ſuppoſed to be 7000 Miles Diameter, ſhould be but 1000 Miles in Earth, and the other 6000 Miles to be a Globe of Water, or ſome fluid Body,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:96771:13"/>for the reaſon before given.</p>
               <p>And this by the way may ſhew the miſtake of their ſuppoſition that think the impendent Column of the Atmoſphere, which they think to be ſeven Miles high, is a bare Column commenſurate in its top and bottom, for it cannot be ſo, but at the moſt is an inverted Cone or <hi>Pyramis,</hi> conſiderably wider at ſeven Miles diſtance then it is at the Earth: which if conſidered, would trouble their Explication of the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Experiment, upon an account of the actual Gravitation of a Column of Air.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Concerning the Gravitation of Solid Bodies in Contiguity, and not in Continuity.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE laws of Statiques do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly demonſtrate, that the weight <hi>A</hi> incumbent upon the ſtaff <hi>B,</hi> which at both extremities is ſupported by <hi>C</hi> and <hi>D,</hi> that <hi>C</hi> bears but one half of the weight <hi>A,</hi> and <hi>D</hi> the other half.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>And conſequently if there were another Staff ſet on croſs from <hi>E</hi> to <hi>F</hi> of the ſame length, each Suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:96771:14"/>would bear but a fourth part of the Weight.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>This being premiſed, I ſhall now conſider the Gravitation of Solids not united and cemented together, either by Contunity of parts, or that which may be equivalent, Lime, Cement, or Morter, as in Brick-wals or Houſes, but of ſuch Solids as are united onely by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguity.</p>
               <p>I will therefore ſuppoſe a <hi>Pyramis</hi> (or if you will a Pillar or Wall, for it will come all to one paſs) having a foundation of twelve Stones, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way a Foot ſquare, and piled up one upon another, breaking off joint according to Art of Maſoncy,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:96771:14"/>but without Cement or Morter; ſo that it will be twelve Foot ſquare at the Baſe, according to this Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, 03 and conſequently the <hi>Area</hi> at the Baſe be 144 ſquare Feet.</p>
               <figure/>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:96771:15"/>
               <p>In this Figure theſe things are obſervable.</p>
               <p>The upper Stone marked (1) is ſupported by the four next Stones upon which it is bottomed, and each of theſe four Stones bear but a fourth part of its weight; the next Row of Stones (being nine) bear each of them but a ninth part of the uppermoſt; and the four next, which is proportionably abated to the lowermoſt Rows. Now ſuppoſe, that the ground or <hi>baſis</hi> whereupon it reſts ſubjected under the middle of the <hi>Pyramis</hi> namely the ſquare of ſixteen ſquare Stones, which make ſixteen ſquare Feet, were gently taken away; yet there would not thereupon ſink a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn of ſixteen ſquare Feet exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the top of the <hi>Pyramis,</hi> for two plain Mechanical Reaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe that Column is not merely ſupported by the baſe of ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:96771:15"/>ſquare Feet, but by the reſidue of the whole Pile; and it would ſtand like an Arch over that Cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which would happen upon the removal of theſe fourteen Stones, and thoſe that are entirely ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe the weight &amp; the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitence of the reſt of the Pile would keep up the <hi>Pyramis,</hi> if it had a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient weight by the reſidue of the Pile to bear one againſt another.</p>
               <p>And ſo the reſidue of the <hi>Pyramis</hi> would ſtand without any Gravita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon that Cavity, which would be left by the ſubſiding of thoſe ſixteen Stones, and thoſe that are meerly ſupported on them, without any actual Gravitation upon that Cavity that is left, but onely upon the reſt of the Baſe of the <hi>Pyramide;</hi> onely thoſe Stones that were entirely ſupported by the ſixteen ſubſiding Stones would
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:96771:16"/>ſink with it, and leave a Cavity like an Arch, maintained by the reſt of the <hi>Pyramis,</hi> according to this enſuing
<figure/>
Figure, ſuppoſed to be the empty place of thoſe ſixteen ſubſiding ſtones, with thoſe entirely ſupported by them, <hi>viz.</hi> nine, four, and one. And this Inſtance I have given of ſquare Stones, to explain the reaſon of the thing: for it will hold in ſmaller and more irregular bodies.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe there were a laying of a Floor of grains of Wheat, in a Floor of about 42 Foot circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and place an Egg, nay an Egg-ſhell, or Glaſs-bubble perfora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that there may be the leſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of reſiſtance by its plenitude
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:96771:16"/>of Air; let this Egg-ſhell or Bubble be placed in the middle of this Floor, that it may not be injured meerly by the hardneſs of the floor, then gently cover it with more Wheat of about a Foot deep, then pour upon it 20 or 40 Buſhels of Wheat; that the Egg-ſhell or Bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble may lie above ten Foot under the top of the Heap; yet this Egg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhell or Bubble ſhall not be broken: and yet take a Glaſs or wooden hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Cylinder, commenſurate in baſe to the Egg-ſhell or Bubble, and four Foot long, ſtopped at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, and lay it gently upon the Egg-ſhell or Bubble, it ſhall with its weight cruſh it to pieces.</p>
               <p>And the reaſon is, 1. Becauſe that every ſubjected grain of Wheat bears two, three, or four above it, and ſo the Egg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhell is not preſſed with the weight of a whole Cylinder of Wheat of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:96771:17"/>ten Foot in height, and proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable in the baſe to the extenſion of the Egg-ſhell, but at the moſt with a ſmall little Cone of Wheat, perchance not two Inches high; ſo that the Egg-ſhell and its little Cap or Cone of Wheat ſtands as under an Arch, ſupported by the reſt of the Grains in the whole Heap.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Although the Grains of Wheat are of viſible and conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble bulk, yet the poſition of the Heap of Wheat directs every Grain of Wheat poured upon the Heap accidentally to a lateral preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure <hi>per declive,</hi> which refracts their perpendicular Gravitation. But of this more particularly and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, when we come to the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation of Fluids.</p>
               <p>And in conformity to theſe, or one of theſe Reaſons, I took a Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder of Deal boards nailed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and open at both ends, of about
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:96771:17"/>two Foot long, and ſix Inches ſquare in the concave Diam, and took two halves of an Egg-ſhell, emptied, and clapped them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which would not ſuſtein half a Pound weight put upon them, without a total cruſhing of them.</p>
               <p>This Egg-ſhell I laid in a little bed of <hi>Calice</hi> Sand, and then putting my hollow Cylinder upon it, and poured into it gently <hi>Callice</hi> Sand, till I had filled my Cylinder to the top, which contained about four Pound weight of Sand, and that very dry, and then upon the Sand I placed about ſix or ſeven pound weight of Lead, and carefully lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down my Cylinder of Sand, I found yet my Egg-ſhell in the ſame ſtate as at firſt, without the leaſt bruiſing, yea and lifting up the Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder of Sand, I found it ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted, that it would not wholly go out, but remained ſuſpended in
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:96771:18"/>the body of the Cylinder, which I attributed, and (as I think) truly to the lateral preſſure of the Sand upon the ſides of the Veſſel, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by theſe minute Particles were dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to lean one againſt another ſo hard, that they retain'd a kind of Solidity by this renitence.</p>
               <p>And I think in this Experiment I have no need to have recourſe to an Intelligent Hylarchical princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that ſuſpended the Sand from Gravitation, nor to that other diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult Solution from the Texture of the ſubjected bodies; but merely to thoſe two formerly mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That each Particle of Sand ſuſtained mechanically the incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent Particles, and left my Egg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhell as it were under an Arch, being preſſed not with a Cylinder o<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Sand proportionable to its baſe, bu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of Sand, that did not conſiderably gravitate upon it.</p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:96771:18"/>
               <p n="2">2. That though the Sand is no fluid body, yet the ſmalneſs of its Corpuſcles had an accidental late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Direction <hi>per deelive</hi> againſt the ſides of the Veſſel, which lateral Direction refracted the perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Gravitation of the Sand, as will be ſhewn more, when we come to conſider of the Gravitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Fluids, which may be illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by this Inſtance.</p>
               <p>And becauſe I propoſed to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute this Tryal farther, I made an Experiment by a heavier body, namely Leaden Hail-ſhot.</p>
               <p>I took a Cylinder of Latten ware, about two Inches in Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and 10 Inches deep, open at both ends, which held about ſix Pound of Shot. I placed it cloſe to a Table, and filled it, and then gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taking it from the Table, the Shot ſubſiding expanded into a compaſs of a Foot Diameter.</p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:96771:19"/>
               <p>I then took the end of an Egg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhell, compreſſible with leſs than a Pound weight, placed it in a little Box that was receptible within the cavity of the Cylinder, and filled it up round with Shot, that it might not receive injury by the fall of the Shot through the. Cylinder, and then clapping the Cylinder upon it, filled it up with about ſix Pound of Shot; but upon the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it the Egg-ſhell was not damnified.</p>
               <p>Then I tried it by an Inſect, namely putting in a Beetle into the box, and covering him with Shot, ſo that the fall of Shot from a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er place might not damniſie him; then putting my Cylinder over the box, filled it up with ſix Pound of Leaden Shot, and then opening it, I found my Beetle as lively as before, yet a weight of Lead in one ſolid body, commenſurate to the baſe of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:96771:19"/>the Beetle would have cruſhed him to pieces.</p>
               <p>So that the Non-gravitation of theſe ſinall bodies of Sand, Granner, and Shot, may ſufficiently prepare our minds to apprehend one of the reaſons of Non-gravitation of Fluids, which though fluid, yet are not disjoined as in thoſe former In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, but a continued body, and therefore the upper Particles there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of more capable of ſupport from thoſe ſubjected Particles.</p>

                     <hi>Concerning the Gravitation of Fluids upon ſubjected Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and firſt of the Gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Water.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>SOme things muſt be premiſed, before I come to the main matter lintend herein.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it is certain Water hath an intrinſecal Gravity of its own, as it is a heavy body.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And conſequently, if Water be conſidered ſeparate from Water, as for the purpoſe when it is put into a Veſſel, as a Pail, Bucket, and hollow Cube, or Globe, the Water and the Veſſel wherein it is making now one body, doth actually gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, and hath only one Direction
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:96771:20"/>of its <hi>motus</hi> or <hi>conatus ad motum,</hi> as other ſolid bodies have, namely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular to the Centre of the Earth, which is the Line and Term of its Motion. So that ſome have by computation eſtimated that a Cubique Foot of Water weighs about 65 Pound; for here the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is not conſidered as a fluid Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but is reduced into the nature of a ſolid heavy body, by the Veſſel wherein it is contained and inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, which together with it makes up one body, and conſequently go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by the rules of Gravitation incident to ſolid bodies, <hi>viz.</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend perpendicularly. Therefore what I am now to treat of is touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the gravitation of Water, as it is in its own conſiſtency a fluid bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and herein farther theſe things are to be admitted:
1. That the gravitation of the fluid water is all one, whether it be
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:96771:21"/>in the great veſſel of the Sea or Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, or in any other artificial and ſmaller veſſel, as a Tub, Trough, or Ciſtern, I mean as to the main queſtion; though there may be ſome various accidental differences in reſpect of the ſtrength, weight, or conſiſtence of the waters them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; therefore the ſame reaſon will be of the Gravitation or Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravitation of Water upon a ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted body, whether it be in the Sea or in a Tub.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That without all queſtion, when Water hath its paſſage out of a Veſſel upon or through a ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>medium</hi> than it ſelf, it doth actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally gravitate; as if a hole be made in the bottome of a Tub, it doth gravitate upon that hole.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not in this place diſpute, whether Water in its fluid conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtency hath not ſome degree of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation, for it hath been experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:96771:21"/>by many, that a Tube of Quickſilver inverted into a veſſel of reſtagnant Quickſilver immer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed into Water, hath ſome Indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the gravitation of Water, by the aſcending of the Quickſilver into the Tube, the deeper it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſed in the water: and there may be reaſon for it, 1. In reſpect of the interſperſions in the water of divers terreſtrial Particles, or <hi>granula arenae,</hi> that are in their own nature heavier than the water; which is viſible to the Eye in great Rivers, and much more in the Sea. 2. There may poſſibly be ſuppoſed a ſmall Cap or Cone of water, that may be impendent upon the ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted body, that may indure ſome inconſiderable and ſcarce percepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble gravitation. [<hi>Vide quae dicta ſunt in fine Capitis 9.</hi>]</p>
               <p>But that this gravitation is in any degree proportionable to the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:96771:22"/>column of Water, impending upon the ſubjected body, with a baſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to it; or indeed that it is any conſiderable preſſure in the hundredth degree of ſuch a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is moſt certainly untrue.</p>

                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>Though ſome contend for ſome gravitation of water, yet it is certain, that fluid water doth not gravitate upon ſubjected bodies in that prodigious proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of weight, that a column of water commenſurate in baſe to the ſubjected bodies, and extending from them to the <hi>ſuperficies</hi> of the water,; for if it ſhould, it muſt cruſh the ſubjected bodies to pieces,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:96771:23"/>or at leaſt wholly ſuſpend their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for ſuch a column of water, ten or twelve Fathom deep, impending upon a Diver, would amount to ſome Tuns of Water, which if ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated in a veſſel, would cruſh all his bones. But the Reaſons that Learned men have aſſigned for this matter, as they differ among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſo they are in themſelves very inevident and unſatisfactory, which, as near as I apprehend them, are much of what follows.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Stevinus</hi> gives this reaſon, that the preſſure of water is equal every way, upward, downward, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally, and therefore the body of a man being thus equally compreſſed every way by the circumjacent wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, hath his continuity preſerved, and is not cruſhed by the impen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding weight of water, neither feels it, but is kept in an equal ſtate and <hi>AEquilibrium.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:96771:23"/>
               <p>But the truth is, this leaves the difficulty equal, if nor worſe than before; for an equal preſſure of every ſide would cruſh his bowels, and breſt, and ribs into an intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble condition, and yet leave him to the ſeverity of the perpendicular weight nevertheleſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Des Cartes</hi> gives this obſcure and ſcarce intelligible Reaſon of it, which, as near as I apprehend him, is thus; Becauſe when the man ſinks into the water, as he deſcends, the ſubjacent water takes the room that his body left. But this ſalves not the difficulty of the Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravitation of the column of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when once got above him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Merſenius</hi> ſalves it, as he thinks, by the Doctrine of <hi>Archimedes, de inſidentibus humido,</hi> namely that any given portion of water ſuffers no weight by the ſuperior portion of water, becauſe they are all of one
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:96771:24"/>equal Gravity, and therefore every part of water ſits quiet in any <hi>ſitus</hi> given, without Gravitation or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gravitated by any portion of it ſelf.</p>
               <p>And that Bodies heavier than water, (as the body of man is) loſeth ſo much of their natural weight, when in the water, by the weight of ſuch a quantity of water, as is commenſurate to the bulk of that heavier body; ſo that it hath no more than what it exceeds the weight of the like quantity of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. As if the body of a man weighs 200 Pound, and the like quantity of water would weigh 150 Pound, the body of a man would weigh in water but 50 Pound, and upon this account a Diver might eaſily e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merge out of the water, for he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries with him but 50 Pound weight; and the intermediate wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter not being gravitated by the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:96771:24"/>portion of water above it, doth not conſequently gravitate upon the man, unleſs ſome accident inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene, as where the body of the man ſtops a Leak or a Hole in that veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel wherein he is.</p>
               <p>But this, though it aſſert the thing, namely that Water gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates not upon Water, or upon any body of an intrinſick Gravity equal to Water, yet it leaves us in the dark, touching the reaſon of the Non-gravitation of Water upon the ſubjacent Water, or any body of an equal intrinſick Gravity with it; ſince he ſeems to agree, that the whole Water gravitates upon the Fund or <hi>baſis</hi> of the Veſſel, for ſome have thought it impoſſible that the whole body of the water ſhould gravitate upon the <hi>baſis,</hi> unleſs eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part gravitate upon what is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termediate between it and the <hi>baſis.</hi> Though by the way this is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequential,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:96771:25"/>ſequential, for a piece of Lead of a Pound weight doth actually gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate upon the Scale, and yet the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per part of that piece of Lead doth not gravitate upon the ſubjacent parts thereof, ſo long as they are one continued body; and ſo it may be, and probably is in fluid bodies, while they have their continuity; for a Bucket of water is as much one continued body, as a Bucket of Pitch or Wax, till it be actually di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided; but of this hereafter.</p>
               <p>A later Author, not content with theſe Explications, hath ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed a middle intelligent nature between Almighty God, and Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or Bodies, which he calls <hi>principium hylarchicum,</hi> under whoſe regiment thoſe various appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Nature are managed, of which we cannot find any ready ſufficient natural Solution. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the end of this learned Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:96771:25"/>be good, namely to convince Atheiſts, and ſuch as deny the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence of ſeparate or Spiritual In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligences, yet me thinks the <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium,</hi> at leaſt as to the particular in hand, is not ſo ſuitable. The moſt important and ſureſt Truths in the world never receive ſo much detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the Arguments and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtry of Opponents, as they do by thoſe Arguments in their favour which have improper <hi>mediums</hi> to ſupport their Concluſions, or ſuch as are capable of other Solutions.</p>
               <p>Moſt certainly the Ever-glorious and moſt Wiſe God is the Author of Nature, and of all the Laws thereof; they are his Inſtitutions by which he orders and regulates the Motions and Appearances in Nature. And he ſupports them as an Univerſal Cauſe, by the conſtant influence of his Power and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and all their Appearances are
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:96771:26"/>nevertheleſs ordinarily regular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to hisinſtituted Laws of Nature. And as it far more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanceth the honour and skill of an excellent Artiſt, that hath ſo fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and ordered an <hi>Automaton,</hi> that it may be regularly guided to its end, according to the deſign of the Artiſt, without the immediate hand or identifical act of the Artiſt to guide every motion: ſo it far more advanceth the glory of the Divine Wiſdom, in that he hath ſetled ſuch a regular order in things of Nature, that may regularly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct them to their deſigned end; then if the Glorious God, or any intelligent Power by him ſubſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſhould by immediate and identical interpoſition produce e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> in Nature, ſaving nevertheleſs to him his Power and Pleaſure <hi>pro arbitrio,</hi> and upon ſuch occaſions as he thinks fit to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:96771:26"/>his own immediate power, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the determination of his own will immediately, or by the miniſtration of Angels or Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, to advance, correct, or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his ſtanding Laws in particular caſes and emergencies.</p>
               <p>But yet farther, it ſeems to me that the particular inſtance of the Non-gravitation of water deſerves no more a recourſe to an Hylarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Agent, than the Inſtance above given of the Non-gravitation of a heap of Sand, or Corn, or Shot; for I think the Solution of one and the other are rational, and much of the ſame kind, as to the Mechanical part hereof.</p>
               <p>But yet farther, a very Late and Excellent man hath endeavoured to give a Solution of this <hi>phaenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> which ſeems leſs ſatisfactory than any of the reſt; for when he hath abundantly demonſtrated by
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:96771:27"/>his exact Experiments that Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals do not ſuffer ſo great a preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure by the incumbent column of water, that doth conſiderably if at all impede their Animal motion, he attributes it to the Frame and Texture of their Bodies, the orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of their Bones, Muſcles, and other parts; and this I confeſs gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifieth the preconceived <hi>hypotheſis</hi> of the Gravitation of the ſuppoſed column of water, (as likewiſe of that of Air, in the Solution of the <hi>Torricellian</hi> Experiment.) But it ſeems to me, that this Solution ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours more of a Miracle than the former ſuppoſition of the Hylar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical Principle: that a Flownder ſhould at Land be preſſed to death by the weight of a gallon of water in a Bucket laid upon him; and yet ſhould not be damniſied by the weight of two, or three, or ten Tun of water in the bottom of the Sea
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:96771:27"/>yet he ſuſtains it without detriment or impediment of his life or agil motion: which I ſay were miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, if thoſe Tuns of water did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually gravitate in that meaſure. Therefore I think there had need be ſome other Solutions than thoſe thought upon, if we can hit upon them.</p>

                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>IN matters controverted, though it be more eaſie to find faults with the ſuppoſitions of others, than to ſubſtitute ſuch in their room as may be leſs capable of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception; yet it is but juſt that (if it be poſſible) for every one that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts againſt anothers ſuppoſition, ſhould exhibit one of his own, that ſo he may run the ſame tryal with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as others have done with him. And therefore in the former Chapter having (as near as I can underſtand them) propounded the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:96771:28"/>Solutions of other men, and laid them by, as ſeeming to me either inevident, or not giving a reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble account of the Probleme, I ſhall now exhibit my own Conjecture of the Reaſon of this Appearance in Nature, wiſhing it no better ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs with others, than it deſerves.</p>
               <p>I have before premiſed, that 1. this queſtion muſt not be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of a veſſel of water, as the <hi>continens</hi> and <hi>res contenta</hi> make but one common Body, for ſo it is but in nature of a ſolid and not of a fluid body, and there is in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect no more conſideration to be had of its fluidity, than if the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the veſſel had been congeled into a whole Kegg of Ice; for the Kegg of Ice and the Water in the Bucket, together with the Bucket containing it; or the Water in the Bladder, together with the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der containing it, deſcend by one
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:96771:29"/>ſimple line of Gravitation, perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicularly from its centre of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity towards the centre of the Earth: but the queſtion is touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the gravitation of the water in its fluid conſiſtence, though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Ocean, or in a Tub or Bucket. 2. That I do not in this place contend againſt all Gravita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of water, for poſſibly there may be ſome little allowed it, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Air, and eſpecially by reaſon of the interſperſions in the water (as likewiſe in the Air) of ſome ſmall Atomes or Particles of terreſtrial Matter, which may be heterogene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the nature of water as ſuch, and as thoſe Particles are in their gravity heavier than water, ſo they may accidentally cauſe a greater gravitation in the Particles of ſome water more than of other, as hath been before ſaid.</p>
               <p>But that which I contend for in
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:96771:29"/>this place, is firſt, that the gravita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of water in its fluid conſiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, whether in the Sea or in a Bucket, if any at all, yet is ſo incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, that it doth not conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably preſs upon ſubjected bodies, nor incommodate Animals that live therein at any profundity, and not in the thouſandth part in actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al gravitation proportionable to the weight of a Column of water commenſurate in baſe to the ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted body, and extending from the ſame to the <hi>ſuperficies</hi> of the water. Secondly, to aſſign ſome reaſon of ſuch Non-gravitation, and why it is not, no nor indeed can be.</p>
               <p>The former of theſe is in effect confeſſed by all impartial Writers, and evident to every days experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. The latter therefore, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the reaſon thereof, are the ſubject of this Chapters inquiry.</p>
               <p>And I think the reaſons of this
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:96771:30"/>Non-gravitation of the Particles of water upon ſuch ſubjected bodies, are eſpecially two. The firſt is Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical, from the ſtructure of the fluid water; and the ſecond is meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly natural, from the nature of Flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ids. Touching the former of theſe, the Mechanical Solution of this Problem, this hath been in effect given before, in the Non-gravita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the parts of ſolid bodies while in Continuity, which it is plain though they all together gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitate upon the Scale, yet one part doth not gravitate upon another: And water, though a fluid body, yet hath its continuity, which is undivided, and ſo gravitates not upon its own parts, nor upon any body within it of equal or greater weight than it ſelf. But 2. admit, that water, in reſpect of its fluidity, ſhould moſt participate of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:96771:30"/>or reaſon of ſolute and ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble bodies, that are only contigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; yet even in thoſe ſolute bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as Sand, Granes, Shot, every Monad of ſuch ſolute bodies gives ſupport to the ſuperjacent Particles, though not united into one <hi>continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> as in the inſtances of a Pyramid of ſquare Stones, a heap of Wheat, or of <hi>Callice</hi> Sand; wherein a kind of Arch is made over the ſubjected bodies, that they by no means ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain the whole weight of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent column, proportionate to the baſe of the body included.</p>
               <p>But in caſe of the body of water, the ſame advantage is infinitely more improveable for the eaſe and ſecurity of the ſubjacent bodies, whether animate or not. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I ſhall not take advantage of the imaginary configuration of the Particles of water invented by <hi>des Cartes,</hi> who ſuppoſeth them to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:96771:31"/>be like ſmall oblong filaments or fibres, not much unlike little Grigs or Eels, which would eaſily make a conſiſtency, that like an Arch would protect and cover the ſubja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent body. Nevertheleſs I ſhall ſay this, that the union of its parts are much cloſer than that of the Monads of <hi>Callice</hi> ſand, for the water is <hi>quid continuum,</hi> though <hi>fluidum;</hi> &amp; therefore as the parts of one conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſolid body do not gravitate upon the other parts, but only upon the common baſe of the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; ſo the parts of water do not gravitate upon themſelves, nor up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any particular baſe leſs than their own baſe, but one part ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtains the other without any gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: as the Arch of a well fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Vault, doth not preſs upon the ſubjected Vault, but each part is ſuſtained by the other, and the whole by thoſe walls from whence
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:96771:31"/>the Ribs of the Arch are drawn. A very little induſtrious trial of the ſuſpenſion of Sand in a Tube fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for that purpoſe, will make the Inſtance more intelligible, than words or writing can do it.</p>
               <p>It may poſſibly be true, that a more broad body, heavier than ſo much quantity of water, may have a greater gravitation of water up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it than a narrower, becauſe the arch that is made over it by the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is greater than that Arch that is made over the narrower body. For inſtance, let us ſuppoſe that in the bottom of a Bucket of water, three foot deep, and one foot in the circumference, there be placed an Ebony rundle, of one Inch thick, and eight Inches Diameter; and in the bottom of the like Bucket there be placed a rundle of Ebony of four Inches Diameter, and of ſuch a thickneſs as may make the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:96771:32"/>weight of it equal to the weight of the greater rundle, as in the ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Figures.
<figure/>
               </p>
               <p>I ſay it may fall out, that the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may more gravitate upon the greater Rundle, than upon the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, becauſe that ſmall Cone of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that is incumbent upon the greater, which hath the larger baſe, makes a larger Conical body of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon that which hath the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger <hi>baſis,</hi> than that which hath the narrower. This may be eaſily tried by a pair of Scales, induſtriouſly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered for ſuch an Experiment. But however that fall out, it is moſt evident, that the whole weight of the column of water, commenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate to the baſe of either Rundle,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:96771:32"/>and extending it ſelf to the <hi>ſuperfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> of the water, doth not in its full weight gravitate upon either, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we ſuppoſe a hole in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Veſſel under either Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and then indeed the water will gravitate upon the Rundle, becauſe it gravitates upon the hole.</p>
               <p>But if the ſubjected body be lighter than the like quantity of water, commenſurable to its bulk, then it is true the water will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine that lighter body, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it to the <hi>ſuperficies,</hi> notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the ſuperimpendent Cone or Column of water: but this is not to my preſent purpoſe to explicate, and therefore I leave it.</p>

                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>I Come now to the ſecond princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Reaſon of this Non-gravita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Water, either upon its infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour parts, or upon any ſubjected Animal or Body, either heavier or equal in weight to the like bulk of Water; for if it be lighter, it will ſwim, as hath been ſaid. And this I take to be the true natural ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Reaſon of the Non-gravitation of Fluids; though the former, namely the Mechanical Reaſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore given is not wholly uſeleſs, but contributes its part to it.</p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:96771:33"/>
               <p>And here I muſt premiſe what I before ſaid of that actual gravita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is either Motion, or <hi>conatus</hi> or <hi>niſus ad motum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore let the body be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo intrinſecally heavy, yet if even by accident (much more if by the natural conſiſtency thereof) that <hi>niſus</hi> or <hi>conatus</hi> be ſuſpended or corrected, the Gravitation abateth. For inſtance, it is moſt certain that the body of the Earth is intrinſecal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heavy, and the heavieſt of all Elements that we know of; yet whether we ſuppoſe it to be the Centre of the World, or that the Sun is that Centre, and the Earth in its <hi>magnus Orbis</hi> moves about it, yet it hath no Gravitation to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline it to change its place, or its circular motion; and the reaſon is, becauſe it hath no <hi>niſus</hi> or <hi>conatus</hi> to any other poſition or place then what it hath.</p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:96771:34"/>
               <p>Again, in matters artificial it is plain, that a Pound of Lead hath its natural motion by a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular direction and line to the centre of the Earth; and this is the true cauſe of its Gravitation upon my Hand, namely its <hi>niſus ad mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum;</hi> and as any body hath the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>niſus</hi> or <hi>conatus</hi> than another, ſo it hath the greater actual Gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, as Gold more than Quickſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, that than Lead, that than Tin, quantity for quantity.</p>
               <p>But if I take a pair of Scales, and in one Scale put a pound of Lead, and in another half a Pound, I check and abate its <hi>conatus,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently its gravitation, and it hath but half the vigor of gravitation as it had before; and if I counterpoiſe it in the other Scale with a full e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual weight, I ſuſpend totally its gravitation, and it ſhall aſcend or deſcend with a ſmall advantage of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:96771:34"/>a grane added to the oppoſite Scale, or to this, and ſtill the reaſon is the ſame, the <hi>niſus,</hi> or <hi>conatus ad motum,</hi> and conſequently the actual gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation depending upon it, is check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Counter-motion of the oppoſite Scale. That therefore which I muſt perform in the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of this Reaſon, conſiſts of theſe Parts or Propoſitions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt Propoſition, which is this; That which hath ſeveral Directions or Lines of its <hi>conatus ad motum,</hi> muſt needs have ſeveral Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections of its Gravitation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That body which hath ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral lines or directions of its Gravita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion variouſly directed, cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely gravitate in one line, or by one direction.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That which doth not gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate by one line or direction, but va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly, it muſt neceſſarily follow, that every tendency, line, or dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:96771:35"/>of its gravitation doth correct and refract the force of its other gravitations according to its other tendencies and directions.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That Fluids, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that of Water and Air, have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral lines of its direction of gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and therefore neceſſarily one muſt be refracted, impeded, and abated by the other.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And conſequently, the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of its perpendicular or lateral gravitation are corrected, and very neer wholly ſuſpended by the other tendencies or directions of its moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And although in order of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning I ſhould begin with the more general Propoſitions; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they will be the beſt eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by beginning with the enquiry into the various directions of the motion, <hi>conatus</hi> and <hi>niſus</hi> of Fluids, I ſhall invert the order of that Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocination, and begin at the latter
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:96771:35"/>end, namely the various Directions of the <hi>conatus</hi> or <hi>niſus ad motum</hi> of Fluids.</p>
               <p>That there is a motion, and <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus ad motum</hi> in water, as a heavy body, in a perpendicular line of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection toward the centre, all do agree, and it need not be queſtioned, for it ſeems it is the primitive <hi>cona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> of this as of all heavy bodies, and is an effect of its intrinſick gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity. But beſides this primitive motion as a heavy Body, it hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other motions and directions as a fluid body, and thoſe naturally belonging to it in that conſiſtency. For inſtance,
1. It hath within the compaſs of its own <hi>ſuperficies</hi> a lateral moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on parallel to the Horizon: which appears by the immerſing of a Tube ſhut at both ends, and placed horizontally below the <hi>ſuperficies</hi> of the water, and then ſuddenly
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:96771:36"/>unſtopping one end, the water will as nimbly move into that Tube, as if it ſtood perpendicular to the Horizon.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Again, within the compaſs of its own <hi>ſuperficies</hi> it hath a moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and conſequently a <hi>conatus ad motum,</hi> and conſequently a gravita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion directly vertical; as it a Tube ſtopt at the lower end, and immer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed into the water, and then the lower end artificially unſtopped, the water will ariſe in that Tube to the level of the <hi>ſuperficies</hi> of the ſtagnant water, and drive out the Air that was in it before.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Again, it is certain, that the water in any veſſel hath <hi>conatus ad motum per declive,</hi> in all points be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a line parallel to the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon, and the line of its perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar gravitation, according to this rude Diagram in the veſſel of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>A.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:96771:36"/>
               <figure/>
               <p>And although for deſcriptions ſake I make theſe lines of direction <hi>per declive,</hi> to be from the centre of the <hi>ſuperficies</hi> of the water, yet I think it improper, and indeed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to ſhew or define, from what point of the water this <hi>cona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus ad motum per declive</hi> begins. Nay farther, it ſeems evident, that wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being a <hi>homogeneal</hi> body, every aſſignable Particle of water hath this direction of <hi>deſcenſus per decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve,</hi> as all other directions incident to its fluid nature, as well as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:96771:37"/>ther motions or <hi>conatus</hi> above ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
               <p>And that the water hath theſe lateral preſſures, and <hi>conatus ad mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumper declive,</hi> is evident to ſenſe; for, take a Barrel ſet upon his baſe, and fill'd with water or any other liquor, it will with almoſt an equal force gravitate upon the ſides of the veſſel, as well as upon the fund or baſe, and break out the ſides if it be not well guarded with Hoops or other ſtrictures.</p>
               <p>Now to apply this poſition to the former Propoſitions, I ſay this various motion and <hi>conatus ad mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> of Fluids, cauſeth ſeveral kinds and <hi>ſpecies</hi> of lines and directions of their Gravitation, ſome directly deſcending, ſome directly aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſome Horizontally lateral, ſome <hi>per declive,</hi> or medial between a line parallel to the Horizon, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular thereunto.</p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:96771:37"/>
               <p>And conſequently in the very ſame fluid body every different di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection (whether lateral <hi>per declive,</hi> or perpendicular) of its Gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is corrected, abated, and refracted by the other; and it is impoſſible it ſhould have its full ſwinge of motion any one way, or by any one line, ſince it hath its conſiderable motion or <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus ad motum,</hi> the ſame moment by another line, either contrary or extremely different from the other, <hi>omnibus intentus minor eſt ad ſingula.</hi> And conſequently the gravitation of Fluids, whether lateral, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular, or <hi>per declive, ſive per modum lineae ſubtenſae,</hi> is abated, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, and refracted, by the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous lines of its tendency: for it is impoſſible that the ſame body can at the ſame time with its full ſwinge be carried to any one point, which at the ſame time hath very
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:96771:38"/>neer an equal <hi>conatus ad motum</hi> to a various point, and by a various line of Direction; or that that Fluid ſhould <hi>totis viribus</hi> be directed in its motion or <hi>conatus</hi> thereunto to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the centre, which at the ſame time is directed laterally, or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the North in its lateral mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or <hi>motus per declive,</hi> which at the ſame time hath a direction or tendency towards the South-Eaſt or Weſt, or any other point of the Compaſs, either laterally or <hi>per declive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is true, that poſſibly that kind of line of Direction in a perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular deſcent may be conſiderably ſtronger and more efficacious, and conſequently the gravitation that way ſtronger than in any one o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther line of direction of its gravita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe there contributes to that motion, not only the nature of Water as a fluid body, but alſo as a
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:96771:38"/>heavy body, which always taketh the ſhorteſt line of direction to the centre, which is the perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</p>
               <p>And hence it is, that if there be an Engine conſiſting of a Baſe pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel to the Horizon, and a perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular upon that Baſe, and a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe or decline <hi>ſuperficies</hi> from that perpendicular to the Horizon, as in the ſubjected Figure.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>The weight <hi>A</hi> upon the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe doth counterpoiſe to the weight <hi>B</hi> in a reverſed proportion, anſwerable to the length of the lines <hi>C E</hi> and <hi>C D.</hi> So that if the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular <hi>C D</hi> be half the length of the Subtenſe <hi>c E,</hi> the ſame weight
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:96771:39"/>upon the line <hi>C D</hi> gravitates double to the ſame weight <hi>A,</hi> upon the line <hi>C E:</hi> becauſe it hath the moſt expedite and ſhort way to the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre by the perpendicular <hi>C D;</hi> and the other by <hi>C E</hi> is longer, and refra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and broken by the inclination and diſtance <hi>C E.</hi> But on the other ſide, if the line of perpendicular deſcent of the Fluid be compared with all thoſe various and many lines of its other direction, when the centre at leaſt hath any conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable depth, the perpendicular mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of its gravitation as a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy body, is either altogether or ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry neer altogether corrected, aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and refracted by its other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or <hi>conatus ad motum,</hi> or gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation as a fluid body, ſince there are as many or more other <hi>ſpecies</hi> of lines directing its <hi>conatus ad motum</hi> in other lines, as there are of its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular deſcent.</p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:96771:39"/>
               <p>And <hi>è converſo,</hi> all the ſeveral la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral lines, or lines of Declivity of its tendency <hi>ad motum</hi> are ſo far cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected and refracted by its perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular, and other <hi>conatus ad motum,</hi> that they are as in the former in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the two equiponderating Ballances, rendred in a manner <hi>in aequilibrio,</hi> and all of its ſeveral lines of Gravitation and tendencies thereunto, are in a very great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree ſuſpended and refracted one by another.</p>
               <p>And ſurely this conſequence is abundantly evidenced by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances before given, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. in the Column of <hi>Callice</hi> Sand: which is much more confirmed in water. For the Monads of <hi>Callice</hi> Sand are actually divided one from another, but the Particles of water are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined in one <hi>Continuum:</hi> the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Callice</hi> Sand <hi>per declive</hi> is not ſimply natural, but aceidental in
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:96771:40"/>reſpect of the poſition of thoſe parts upon which it falls, which becauſe they one hinder another from the next and ſhorteſt way to the centre of their motion, by a ſtraight line, therefore move <hi>per declive</hi> as well as they may. But Fluids have all thoſe varieties of tendencies inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to their nature; yet it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent beyond all contradiction, that this accidental te<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>dency of the motion of Sands <hi>per declive,</hi> doth break the perpendicular gravita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and makes it not to gravitate upon the moſt fragile ſubjected bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in its full weight.</p>
               <p>But I ſhall yet farther adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to add one farther Explication and Enforcement of this Suppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: it is aſſerted by ſome, that a Foot ſquare or Cubique Foot of water, weighs about 65 pounds, which I have not Experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and therefore cannot aſſert;
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:96771:40"/>But I will ſuppoſe (as making beſt for the Explication of what I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend) it weighs but twelve pound, and this is the entire perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar weight of this portion of water; for <hi>ex ſuppoſito</hi> it weighs no more, being put into a Bucket, &amp; weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a pair of Scales, with due al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance for the weight of the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel; and it is impoſſible it ſhould be more in the whole than the weight ſuppoſed.</p>
               <p>But it is apparent, that the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of this weight of twelve Pound, allowed to the water while it is in the Bucket, is not only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular upon the Baſe, but late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally upon the Sides of the veſſel that contains it: and every ſide of this Cube of water hath as many kinds for its Direction of deſcent lateral or <hi>per declive,</hi> as the Baſe hath for its perpendicular deſcent.</p>
               <p>And yet here is but entirely crie
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:96771:41"/>twelve Pound weight of water, that muſt ſerve as the common ſtock of all its Preſſures, <hi>viz.</hi> late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>per declive,</hi> or perpendicular, and muſt be diſtributed to all theſe lines as water from one common Ciſtern, through ſo many Pipes to ſerve all theſe Gravitations, or <hi>conatus ad motum;</hi> for it hath not in all above twelve Pound weight to ſerve all theſe <hi>conatus</hi> or Gravitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>The conſequence whereof is of neceſſity, that this common ſtock of intrinſick weight of twelve pound, belonging to all this portion of water, is neither intirely allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the ſupply or portion of the perpendicular weight or gravita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor entirely allowed to the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral gravitation, or the <hi>niſus ad mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum per declive,</hi> nor to any one kind of Line of either of theſe <hi>conatus;</hi> but is indifferently, or very neer
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:96771:41"/>indifferently communicated to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry line of its <hi>conatus ad motum,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lineally deſcending, or colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally, or <hi>per declive,</hi> and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon portion of twelve Pound weight is very neer equally divided to every line of Direction in the water, which are as many as there be diviſible parts in the lateral or ſubjected baſe of the veſſel of water.</p>
               <p>And by this diſtribution it muſt needs fall out, that the weight of twelve Pound of water is infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtributed according to various direction, and no one line can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the entire gravitation of that twelve pound of water, no nor to the thouſandth part thereof, conſidering its various diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>And now if any one ſhall ask, if the water in the Bucket hath not one entire gravitation towards the Centre in the perpendicular Line,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:96771:42"/>but hath its weight thus diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſeveral lines of direction; how it comes to paſs that the whole Bucket of water weighs perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly twelve Pound, and that weight is not broken by the lateral preſſure of the water.</p>
               <p>The Anſwer is plain, and hath been ſufficiently inſinuated before.</p>
               <p>The water in the Bucket is as fluid a body as ſo much water in the Ocean, and hath the ſame kind of motion, and <hi>conatus ad motum,</hi> as well collaterally as by direct de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent, as is incident to its nature, though it receive an obſtruction in that motion, by the ſtrong ſides and contignation of the Bucket. But the Bucket of water is now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as one ſolid body, and gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates according to a ſolid body, <hi>viz. per lineam deſcenſionis,</hi> and not as a Fluid <hi>quoquoverſum:</hi> and though the fluid water within the Bucket
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:96771:42"/>preſs upon all parts of the Bucket, according to its natural and vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous tendency, yet it goes no farther, nor do the ſides of the Bucket preſs upon the ambient Air, or <hi>medium,</hi> being ſufficiently ſecured by its ſtrength and firmneſs, and not yeil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <hi>conatus</hi> or <hi>niſus</hi> of the included water.</p>
               <p>Many other Inſtances and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments might be added for the evincing of the truth of this Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, but if I make my ſelf intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible to the Reader, theſe are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to explicate what I mean, and his own obſervation will fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh him with Experiments either to confute, or to confirm what I have ſaid.</p>

               <p n="3">3. That a fluid body contained within a ſolid veſſel, doth not with its full weight gravitate upon the baſe of that veſſel that contains it, as the whole body of the Sea, or of the water in a Bucket, doth not gravitate with its full weight upon the entire baſe that ſuſtains it; and this is in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the natural conſiſtency and frame of Fluids, not purely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of Mechanical Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtentation, which muſt be agreed ſomewhere to gravitate, though not upon all parts, as hath been ſhewn.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Though it were granted that the entire bulk and weight of the water in the Sea or a Veſſel might gravitate upon the entire baſe, (which yet is not admitted) yet the parallel parts of water do not entirely gravitate upon a part
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:96771:44"/>proportionable to them.

               <p n="5">5. That conſequently, no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy heavier than water in the baſe of Fund, doth ſuſtain a weight of water proportionable to ſuch a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn of water as is in the baſe and top, commenſurate to the ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the body in the fund or bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom.</p>
               <p>I ſhall add this unpoliſhed Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the concluſion of this <hi>Chap.</hi> namely, I made an Experiment touching the weight of a piece of Lead, in ſeveral depths of water;
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:96771:44"/>I cannot build much upon it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe my opportunities for it were not exact, nor ſuch as others may have, yet I ſhall offer it: others may make, or poſſibly have made it with more exactneſs.</p>
               <p>I took a flat round Cake of Lead, of four Inches Diameter, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king four holes in the four quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of it, I ſuſpended it parallel to the Horizon upon a Packthrid of five Foot long, and hanged it to the end of a ballance like the Diſh or Scale, and counterpoiſed the Lead and Packthrid by a weight impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the other Scale, the Lead and Packthrid <hi>in arido</hi> weighed ten Ounces, and as much as the Diſh wherein the ten ounces were pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, which poſſibly might be about two ounces more, in all about 12 Ounces.</p>
               <p>In a veſſel above four foot deep in water, I immerſed the Lead four
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:96771:45"/>Foot deep in water, and then (as it needs muſt by the groſsneſs of the <hi>medium</hi>) it loſt part of its gravita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and weighed only eight Oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ½ ¼, beſides the weight of the oppoſite Scale. Then taking up the ſtring ſhorter, I immerſed it only in a Foot depth of water, but yet it gain'd no more weight that I could perceive, but weighed as before one Ounce ½ ¼.</p>
               <p>But indeed immerſing it onely in one Inch of water below the <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies,</hi> it increaſed its weight near ⅛ of of an Ounce, for the Lead weighed one Ounce ½ ¼ ⅛ of an Ounce, or very near thereabouts, beſides the weight of the oppoſite Scale or Diſh.</p>
               <p>By this rude Experiment it ſeems the Column of four Foot of water, gravitated no more than one Foot of water; for if it had any acceſſion of weight, it was not perceptible,

As, for inſtance, that upon a reſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant veſſel of three Inches diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the weight of the incumbent column of Air, actually gravitating upon that reſtagnant veſſel of Quick-ſilver, and commenſurate to the baſe thereof, and extending from the ſame to the upper ſurface of the Atmoſphere, which they ſuppoſe to be 6 or 7 Miles) ſhould counterpoiſe a ſuſpended column of Quick-ſilver, which may be 2, 3, 4, or 5 Pounds, according to the bigneſs of the Tube. This, I ſay, ſeems to me but an Imagination, and impoſſible to be true, and would choak all Animals on the Earth in two minutes, if it were ſo.</p>
               <p>For the plain truth is, the Air, no nor yet the Atmoſphere, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding its interſperſions, hath no conſiderable gravitation upon ſubjected bodies. And the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:96771:47"/>reaſon is in effect before given, in the caſe of the water, and its gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, but with much greater ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage applicable to the Air.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The body of the Air is not only <hi>quid continuum,</hi> but the parts of it are ſo contiguated, like a Net, that each part ſupports another; and its as impoſſible that one part ſhould gravitate conſiderably upon any ſubjected body, as the Arch of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Abby ſhould gravitate upon the people in the Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>conatus ad motum,</hi> and conſequently the gravitation of the Air is <hi>quoquoverſum,</hi> viz. <hi>ſurſum, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orſum, dextrorſum, ſiniſtrorſum, &amp;c.</hi> it will come down my chimney, and in at my door, and up my ſtairs, and theſe various <hi>conatus ad motum</hi> of the Air and of its Particles, do neceſſarily refract any gravitation that it may imaginably have <hi>per li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neam perpendicularem deſcenſus,</hi> and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:96771:47"/>renders it <hi>equable</hi> and diſingaged from any one line of preſence.</p>
               <p>And by this <hi>conatus ad motum,</hi> I mean not that Imaginary <hi>Elaterium</hi> which ſome have called in to the Aid of their ſolution of the <hi>Torricel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> Experiment, which I muſt needs ſay needs more help than one: for though Air violently compreſs'd, as in Wind-guns, hath its <hi>conatus</hi> of reſtitution to its natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſtaple, and being expanded by Rarifaction, hath its natural moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or <hi>conatus</hi> of reſtitution to its due conſiſtency, as appears in the <hi>Torricellian,</hi> and divers other Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments; yet the great <hi>Elaterium</hi> of the Air in its natural conſiſtence, called in by ſome to help at a lift, as it hath little evidence, ſo it contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes leſs to the ſolution.</p>
               <p>Indeed it hath a Fluidity greater than Water, and therefore is move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to all places for its reception.
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:96771:48"/>It is compreſſible, which water is not; but for any <hi>Elaterium,</hi> or ſuch conſiderable Expanſion of it ſelf, as to offer any force to other bodies, ſeems unwarranted by reaſon or Experience, or common ſenſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs where by violence or accident compreſſed or expanded beyond its natural ſize.</p>
               <p>But I do not at preſent purſue this matter to all its Refuges, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires more time and Paper, and will exceed the bounds of my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Pamphlet; and beſides, the Diſcuſſion beforegoing, touching the reaſon of <hi>Non-gravitation of Water,</hi> renders that concerning <hi>Non-gravitation of Air</hi> eaſily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible, and applicable to it, with much greater advantage of reaſon and evidence.</p>
