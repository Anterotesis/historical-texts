            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="1">1. IN the Preface and first six Chapters, is discussed all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to the first imputation about <hi>Disobedience</hi> or <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,</hi> either out of the <hi>Catholicke</hi> or <hi>Protestant</hi> do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, vse, practice, or consequence therof: with what is obiected, or answered on both partes.</p>
            <p n="2">2. IN the other 7. Chapters, is treated the Question of <hi>Equiuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> how it began, what origen, causes, vse, or necessity it hath, or may haue; what circumstances for lawfulnes, what restraintes, or limites: and finally, what practice among all sortes of men in certaine cases, euen with those that most impugne the same.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Vpon all which is inferred the principall conclusion; that these two pretended obstacles do not let, but that <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke</hi> and <hi>Protestant</hi> English Subiectes may liue togeather in vnion of dutifull obedience vnder his Maiesty, to his, and their both safety and comfortes, if seditious make-bates be remoued.</p>

            <p>IT was no part of my purpose (learned Countrey-men) when I tooke this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise first in hand, either to wade so farre therin, as now I haue byn compelled; or yet to prefix any other Epistle Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory before the same, then the large common Preface it selfe that doth ensue, which may partly appeare by the argument therof, as namely also and principally, by that which we haue set downe in the third Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this Treatise: for that taking in hand, but to point, as it were, at the exorbitant number of some monstrous, and malitious lyes, and slaunders cast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad this last yeare in a certayne small contemptible, but wicked and hatefull libell, vnder the tytle of <hi>A dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couery of Romish doctrine in the case of Conspiracy and Rebellion by T.

            <p n="2">2. Which point hauing to my iudgment sufficiently performed, I saw a farre greater booke published from the same Author stuffed with Marchandize of like marke, but yet imbracing more matter, to wit, n t only the former argument, or inuectiue of heynous <hi>Rebellion;</hi> but (to vse the writers wordes) <hi>of heathenish, hellish, and execrable Equiuocation,</hi> chargin Catholicke people so deeply and desperatly in them both, as t<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

Chapter of the ensuing Treatise, which is the first concerning that argument. But such as are more conuersant and better studied in the said sciences, and know the true principles wheron the question stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, are not so rash nor headlong, but goe more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruedly therin, distinguishing betweene <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

My second reason was, for that forreine Vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and learned men therof, vnde standing such a booke to haue byn set forth by an English Vniuersity man, <hi>and not without direction</hi> (as he saith) <hi>from his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors,</hi> wherin all vse of <hi>Equiuocation</hi> or <hi>Amphybology</hi> in any case whatsoeuer is condemned as vnlawfull, <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious

Wherfore these stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers are wont to demaund, whether there be any lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men indeed in these three facultyes now in our Vniuersities, and whether any be studyed in Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Deuinity and the Lawes, either Ciuill or Canon; for if there be, it seemes impossible to them that such a booke should be suffered to come forth so full of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance as this is.

as occurre daylie in all the foresaid three faculties, and in the common vse of mans life; these learned men affirme, that it is impossible for our Vniuersity-Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors to haue read and weighed them, but they must confesse the lawfulnes of <hi>Equiuocation</hi> in diuers cases, and that it may be without lying (which is lawfull in no case, nor for any cause whatsoeuer.) Wherof they inferre that either their sciences are not studyed in our Vniuersites, or that the students profit little in them, or that the worst learned of all are suffered to write bookes: which thing for that it appertayneth to the disgrace of your so famous Schooles; I thought it one sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t cause amongst the rest, to dedicate this Answere vnto yow.</p>

And so I desire no more but your attention in this one point, for the decision of the controuersie betweene me and <hi>Thomas Morton:</hi> for if yow find him to haue dealt sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerly in alleaging his Authors, I am content he haue the victory, though he haue behaued himself other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise neuer so weakly.

was the matter so exaggerated euery where, both by bookes, preachings, and publike speeches of Magistrates, as if it had byn a most heinous attempt in deed: and not only these, but by this occasion all Catholicks generally were most odiously traduced, especially in this one point (that touched them neerest) to wit, that they would seeme to conceaue any least hope of his Maiesties clemency and mercy towardes them by way of toleration or conniuency for their Religion, or mitigation of their continuall pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures for the same.</p>

But to leaue of the recitall of any more bookes or pamphlets to this effect, there hath appeared further a matter of far greater importance, which is a Catalogue of new lawes suggested in this Parlament against the said Catholickes, wherin besides the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer heape of penall statutes made to this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction in precedent times, diuers new are proposed for an addition and aggrauation of their Calamities, far more rigorous (if they<note n="*" place="margin">Now they are passed.</note> passe) then the former; which being consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by forreine people doe make the state of English Catholickes vnder Protestant go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement to seeme vnto them much more miserable and intolerable, then that of the <hi>Ievves</hi> vnder any sorte of Christian Princes, or that of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> or other Christians vnder the <hi>Turke,</hi> or <hi>Persian;</hi> or that of bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>subiectes vnder the <hi>Polonians, Svvecians, Moscouians,</hi> and other such Nations: so as all this tendeth as yow see (and as before we haue noted) to more desperate disunion of min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des and exasperation of hartes.</p>

Only I must confesse, that in two mens writings I finde more moderation, then in any of the rest; who yet being more interessed in the late grieuous designed delict, then any of the other that write therof, had most cause to be prouoked against the delinquents The first is his Maiesties speach both in his Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Court of Parlament.

               </gap>, touched by him of the Popes authority, concerning Princes and the lawfulnes of Equiuocation in certaine cases, as they are matters not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perteining<note place="margin">Against my Lord of Salis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buries Deuine.</note> properly to his faculty, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession: so must I thinke that his Deuine did somewhat mistake, or misinforme him therin.

            <p n="20">20. To the former clause touching his L. desire to haue the matter defined and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, his Deuine might easely haue infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him, that among Catholicke people the matter is cleare, and sufficiently defined, and declared in all pointes wherin there may be any doubt concerning this affaire. As for<note place="margin">The first question about authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ouer Princes.</note> example in three thinges question may be made: first whether any authority were left by Christ in his Church and Christian common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth to restraine or represse, censure or iudge any exorbitant and pernicious excesse of Great men, States or Princes, or that he had left them remediles wholy by any ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary authority? In which case as in other
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:14593:26"/>
common-wealthes that are not Christian, all Philosophers, law-makers, Senatours, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellours, Historiographers, and other sortes of soundest wisedome, prudence, and experience, either Iew or Gentile, haue from the beginning of the world concurred in this; that God and nature hath left some sufficient authority in euery common wealth, for the lawfull, and orderly redressing of those euilles, euen in the highest persons. Nor did euer Philosopher of name, or law-maker hitherto deny this asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as founded in the very law of nature, nations, and reason it selfe.</p>
            <p n="21">21. So when Christ our Sauiour came to found his common-wealth of Christians in farre more perfection then other states had byn established before, subiecting temporall thinges to spirituall, according to the degree of their natures, endes, and eminencies, and appointing a supreme vniuersall Gouernour in the one, with a generall charge to looke to all his sheepe, without exception of great or small, people or potentates: vpon these suppositions (I say) all Catholicke learned men do ground, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> euer grounded, that in
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:14593:26"/>
Christian common-wealthes, not only the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said ordinary authority is left, which euery other state and Kingdome had by God and nature to preserue and protect themselues in the cases before laid downe; but further also for more sure, and orderly proceeding therin, that the supreme care, iudgment, direction and censure of this matter was left princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally by Christ our Sauiour vnto the said supreme Gouernour, and Pastour of his Church and common-wealth. And in this there is no difference in opinion or beliefe betweene any sorte of Catholickes whatsoeuer (so they be Catholickes) though in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar cases, diuersity of persons, time, place, cause, and other circumstances, may moue some diuersity of opinions. And thus much of the first question.</p>
            <p n="22">22. The second may be about the manner<note place="margin">The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> how this authority, or in what sorte it was giuen by Christ to his said supreme Pastour, whether directly or indirectly, immediatly or by a certaine consequence. As for example, whether Christ, as he gaue the generall charge of his sheepe to <hi>S. Peter</hi> and his Successours
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:14593:27"/>
directly and immediatly in spirituall matters, by that commission three times repeated in S. Iohn. <hi>Pasce oues meas;</hi> which wordes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, according to Catholicke exposition, not only authority to feed, but to gouerne also, direct, restraine, cure, represse, and correct, when need is, as we see it doth appertaine to a temporall sheepheardes office: so whether with this commission in spirituall affaires, our Sauiour gaue also immediatly and directly, the charge and ouersight of temporalities in like manner, or rather indirectly and by a certaine consequence: that is to say, that when the gouernment of spirituall affaires, to wit, of soules to their eternall blisse and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation is so letted, or impugned by any tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall gouernours, as the said spirituall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission cannot be executed without redresse or remedy; in such cases, and not otherwise, the said supreme pastour to haue authority to proceed also against the said temporall Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours, for defence and preseruation of his spirituall charge. Of which question the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonistes doe commonly defend the first part, but Catholicke Deuines for the most part the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:14593:27"/>
second: but both partes fully agree, that there is such an Authority lefte by Christ in his Church, for remedy of vrgent cases, for that otherwise he should not haue sufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided for the necessity therof. So as this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of the manner maketh no difference at all in the thing it selfe.</p>
            <p n="23">23. The third question may be about the<note place="margin">The third questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> causes, for which this authority may be vsed, as also the forme of proceeding to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued therin; wherabout there are so many particularities to be considered, as are ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long for this place: only it is sufficient for Catholicke men to know, that this may not be done without iust cause, graue and vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent motiues, and due forme also of procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, by admonition, preuention, interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and other like preambles, prescribed by Ecclesiasticall Canons to be obserued, wherby my Lordships doubtes of feares, and ielosies <hi>of continuall treasons, and bloudy assas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinates</hi> may iustly be remoued. For that this authority doth not only not allow any such wicked, or vnlawfull attemptes of priuate men, but doth also expressely and publickly
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:14593:28"/>
condemne the same and the doctrine therof, as may appeare not only by the condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>VVicklifs</hi> wicked article, in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell <hi>of Constance,</hi> wherin he affirmed: <hi>That<note place="margin">Sess. 15.</note> it vvas lavvfull for euery priuate man to kill any Prince vvhome he held to be a Tyrant,</hi> but also by like condemnation of <hi>Caluin, Beza, Ottoman, Bucchanan, Knox, Goodman,</hi> and others of that sect, who hold and practice in effect the same do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>VVickliffe,</hi> concerning Princes, if not worse, as shall more largely and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly be declared afterward in the first and fourth Chapters of this Treatise.

the Kinges Maiesty of <hi>Great Britany,</hi> and his Catholicke subiectes (for thither he bendeth all his battery) the more irreconciliable and remedilesse he placeth the ground of this incompossibility, not in the will, which may be changed, but in the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and beliefe of Catholickes; to wit, in their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blicke and receiued doctrine, which doctrine well he knoweth not to lye in the handes of particular men, nor of particuler Prouinces, to change or alter at their pleasure (as Protestantes may, and doe, heere taking a part, and there leauing as they list,) but they must stand firmely, and vniuersally to the whole, this being truely <hi>Catholicum</hi> as ancient Fathers define it.

Now let vs examine some other circumstances of this proposition.</p>
            <p n="2">2. First then, I say and auerre, that this his maine and fundamentall axiome, of the incompossibility of Catholicke and Protestant people togeather, vnder the Gouernement of his Maiesty of <hi>Great Britany,</hi> is not only false and erroneous in it selfe (as afterward<note place="margin">The maine propositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of T.

For I would first demaund this famous mak-bate, what gaine or vtility may be expected, either to Prince or people by putting in
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:14593:31"/>
print this so odious an assertion of extreeme diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and distrust betweene his Maiesty, and so many thousande of his subiects, that admitted him with all ioy &amp; comfort at his first entrance to the Crowne? Is it (perhaps) to preue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t some da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger that may be doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from such kind of people, and to make his Maiesty more carefull and vigilant for his safty? If that be so, a priuate aduise had beene more important to himselfe, or his Counsell: for that the publishing and proclay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming therof procureth not only diffide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, but also rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les solicitude on both sides, the one to preue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the other.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Secondly I would aske, what he will doe, or haue to be done with so great a multitude of people, as in all his Maiesties Kingdomes doe loue and fauour the Religion, which this masked Minister impugneth, and would put them in despaire of any sufferance or tolerable condition vnder his Maiesties gouernment? Will he haue them all made away from the face of the Earth? This were hard, except <hi>Noe</hi> his floud should: come againe, or some other equiualent inundation,: either of water, fyer, or sword. And for the later, though some thinke he could wish it, yet who kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth not, but that the bowels of England are so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byned and linked togeather at this day in this point, as hardly can the sword passe the one, but it must: wound also deeply the other. What then? Will he haue them to liue in perpetuall torment, hatred, suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions, iealosyes, auersions, detestations, &amp; deadly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilities, the one with the other? This is a state more fit for hell, then for any peaceable and Christian com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, nor of it selfe is it durable, if we beleeue either reason, or experience of former times. For we know what <hi>Cicero,</hi> what other wise-men among the<note place="margin">Cicero lib. offic.</note> very Heathens haue obserued, what they haue writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, what they haue counselled to be done, or to be preuented in like occasions: to wit, that multitudes

               <p n="57">57. And now let the iudicious Reader consider how many corruptions this crasty Minister hath vsed to bring forth to his purpose, this one little distracted text, for proof of professed bloudy massacres inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by vs against Protestantes. For first he corrupteth the wordes of the glosse apparantly, and that in diuers pointes, leauing out that which the glosse saith, and adding that which the glosse hath not: then he cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupteth the meaning both of glosse and Canon, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prauing<note place="margin">A Catalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue of cor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>.</note> that to a wicked sense of bloudy massacring without distinction of sex or kinred; which the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non and Councell of <hi>Carthage</hi> with <hi>S. Augustine</hi> meant only of ciuill punishment against Heretickes, to wit that they could not be made heires to Ecclesiasticall men. Thirdly he peruerteth in like manner <hi>S. Hieromes</hi> intent, which was that albeit he wished that Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes should be punished also bodily, yet by order and forme of law, and not that any one should kill ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp; much lesse by bloudy massacres, as this fellow setteth it downe in his marginall note. And lastly he presumeth to peruert the very wordes of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in the law, by translating <hi>fundas sanguinem ipsorum,</hi> spill their bloud, insteed <hi>of shed their bloud,</hi> as though God were a bloud-spiller, or comaunded the same to be done vniustly by others: but all is strained by the Minister to make vs odious, wheras himself indeed is therby made ridiculous. And for that I haue byn somewhat longer in this example then I had purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, as also for that by this one (if it were but one) yow may ghesse of al the rest of his proceeding, I wil heere
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:14593:59"/>
cease, referring the rest of this kinde, to other more fit places and occasions afterwardes.</p>
               <p n="58">58. And yet truly I cannot wel pretermit, for ending this Chapter, one little note more of rare singularity in this man aboue others, which I scarce euer haue obserued in any one of his fellowes, and this is, that the very first wordes of Scripture alledged by him in the first page of his booke, for the poesy of his pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet are falsly alleadged, corrupted and mangled, though they conteine but one only verse of <hi>Isay</hi> the Prophet; and then may yow imagine, what liberty he will take to himself afterward throughout his whole discourse. His sentence or poesy is this: <hi>Isay.</hi> 29. <hi>vers.</hi> 9.<note place="margin">The very first text of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by him most corruptly.</note> 
                  <hi>But stay your selues and wonder, they are blinde and make yow blinde,</hi> which he would haue to be vnderstood of vs Catholickes: but let any man read the place of <hi>Isay</hi> it self, and he shall finde no such matter either in wordes or sense, but only the word <hi>wonder,</hi> to wit <hi>obstupescite &amp; admiramini, fluctuate &amp; vacillate, inebriamini, &amp; non a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no, mouemini, &amp; non ab ebrietate:</hi> And according to this are the Greek and Hebrew textes also. So as what should moue T. M. to set downe so corruptly the very first sentence of his booke, and cite the Chapter and verse wherin his fraude may be descried I know not, except he obserued not the last clause of the Prophetes precept, <hi>mouemini, &amp; non ab ebrietate.</hi> And so much for this.</p>

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:14593:60"/>
proued and confirmed in that which is to ensue.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It moued me also not a little to goe forward some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what with this confutation (though in as breiffe manner as might be) to see that this deuise (though<note place="margin">T.

Wherupon, forsomuch as this new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised accusation, of Rebellious doctrine and Equiuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, is taken vp by so many handes of those that be enemies to Catholicke Religion; I thought it conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to cleere somewhat more this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap>; and as I had, before I laid aside this worke, treated sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as it seemed to me, of the former point, concerning Rebellious doctrine, vpon the sight only of T.

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:14593:61"/>
to the doctrine of Equiuocation, made no lesse odious now by continuall clamours of sycophancy, then the other of Rebellion it selfe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. One other circumstance also stirred me greatly to proceed in this short worke, which was, that togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with these bookes sent out of <hi>England,</hi> aduertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was giuen, that this Minister <hi>Thomas Morton</hi> was Chaplain to my Lord of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who being head of the spirituall Court of Arches, which is, or ought to be the supreame for matters of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science in England,<note place="margin">T.

And if I proue not this after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, by multiplicity of manifest &amp; manifold exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, as in part yow haue seene that I haue done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, let me be thought to haue done him iniury (which willingly I would not doe vnto the worst man liuing) in which place I hold not him, though by his pen I must needes iudge him to be bad inough.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Now then to the point it self of his Reply, which he calleth, as hath byn said, <hi>A full satisfaction;</hi> it seemeth to me as full as pipes and hoggesheades are wont to be heere in these countreys at the time of vintage, when they are full only of winde and aire and nothing els; and so yow shall see afterwardes, that this his Reply is<note place="margin">The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters manner of dealing.</note> full of wordes without substance, of florish without truth, of fraude without reall dealing: for that lightly he scarsely alledgeth any text of his Aduersaries wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, without some fort of sophistication both of wordes and sense, or other like knackes. And further so distracteth and dismembreth his aduersaries threed
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:14593:61"/>
of speach, citing one branch of it in one part of his Reply, another in another, one sentence first that should haue byn last, and another last that should haue byn first, therby to confound the Readers memory; one period halfe deuided, the other quartered, the third left out, the fourth disguised: so as it is euident that he sought rather to fly, to couer, shaddow, and hide himself, then really and substantially to come to the combate, as examples ensuing shall make all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest.</p>

            <p n="14">14. Secondly he taketh vpon him yet more fondly in the second part of this his Reply, to make a publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que iustification of all Protestantes for rebelling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

Fourthly I can as little commend the Ministers wit for drawing into the field againe a new disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and speciall Treatise of his, adioined in the end of this his Reply, about Equiuocation or doubtfull speeches, sometimes lawfull to be vsed for good and pious endes, and for auoiding sinne and other hurtes both spirituall &amp; temporall, wherin though the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes and necessity therof both by law of nature, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine and humane, haue byn made euident, vpon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers occasions in England these later yeares, since this<note place="margin">T.

And for this also I remit my self to the proofes that after shall ensue.</p>
            <p n="17">17. And so to conclude this Chapter, concerning my iudgment about the Answere and Reply to the foresaid Discouery of Rebellion and Equiuocation, I must needes say, that the Answerer hath endeauored to effectuate so much as he promised in the title of his booke, which was, of <hi>a iust and moderate Answere,</hi> and in performance therof, hath not only borne on mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters temperately, as before hath byn shewed, but spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red also his Aduersary in many pointes, and namely in passing ouer his allegations without note or check,

hauing not perhaps either time or commodity of bookes to examine the same, or perswading himself, that in so small a pamphlet, and palpable matter, a<note place="margin">The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors Ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And for this he cited many instances, authorities and examples; and we haue added more in the said second Chapter that goeth before.</p>

                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:14593:68"/>4. Now then it is to be considered maturely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out passion or heat of contention, whether this be so or not, and how T. M. doth answere these instances of his first aduersary (for mine hitherto he hath not seene:) for if this be true, that indeed they are held for Heretickes by learned and graue men of their owne profession, who are no lesse opposite to vs then they; then falleth first the ground of his bitter exclamation against vs for reputing them so, &amp; secondly followeth it also, that as great probabilities of treasons and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracies may be suspected from those of the other se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctes, that hold them for such, (if that opinion be the cause of treasons) as <hi>Lutherans, Zuinglians, Puritans,</hi> and<note place="margin">Marke these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences</note> the like. And lastly ensueth a weighty consideration, that if by all sides they be held for Heretickes, how deeply the graue or rather grieuous assertion of <hi>S.

in the name of all their brethren (whome they<note place="margin">Admonit. 2. to the Par. pa. 25. &amp; suppl. vers. 36.</note> say to be thousands) that the ordinary Protestantes of England are not only in errour and Heresy, but are plaine Infidelles; and that it is infidelity to goe to their Churches; and that it was a damnable sinne in the Parliament, yea more heinous then that of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha</hi> to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme such an erroneous Religion. And the same and other like censures of theirs are related in my Lord of <hi>Canterbury</hi> his booke of <hi>Dangerous posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:</hi> and the occasion and foundation of this censure and iudgment is set downe of late very cleerly in the preface to the answere to <hi>Syr Edward Cookes</hi> Reports, where is shewed why (supposing the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des of both Religions and differences, especially in the origen of Ecclesiasticall power which giueth essence to the true Church) they cannot be but as heathens, publicans and Infidelles the one to the other.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Now then how doe yow thinke that T. M. shif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth of this charge?

when he came to the purpose, he was so far from being full &amp; round, as to foure whole Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which the other had made of this matter, to shew the dissentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Protestants among themselues, &amp; the condemnation of Caluinistes by all other Protestant sectes of our time, he answered not twice foure lines to all the said discourses, testimonies, examples, and demonstrations, but dissembling al, as though no such thing had byn written by his aduersary, at last in the<note place="margin">Sutcliffe in his full ansvvere, part. 1.

it with his being a King, he meant (and so he ought to doe) as he was man, and inferiour to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and when he speaketh of the other, of his being a King, he vnderstandeth it, as he was God and equall to his Father; and so taking the one in one meaning, and the other in the other, his principall meaning is to deceaue his Reader with a sophisticall argument instead of a demonstratiue; &amp; yet doth the good man so confide in his logicall science, as in one place he triumpheth ouer his Aduersary, that did but once name Logicke in these wordes: <hi>Dare yow</hi> (saith he) <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale to Logicke? this is the art of all artes, and the high tribunall</hi>

            <p n="15">15. And then in the other two sequent Chapters to wit the seauenth and eight, he doth prosecute the same argument of the high dignity of Christes Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood<note place="margin">Hebr. 7.</note> much more largely. <q>Among the Iewes (saith he) there were many Priestes made, for that they were letted by death to remaine, but this our high Priest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth for euer: his Priesthood is eternall, wherof it ensueth that he can for euer saue vs, interposing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with God for vs by himself, and euer lyuing to make intercession for vs, for such a high Priest was it conuenient that we should haue, holy, innocent, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spotted, seperated from sinners, and more excellent then the heauens themselues.

            </p>
            <p n="16">16. All this &amp; much more hath <hi>S. Paul</hi> in that Epist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le of the eminency of Christes Priesthood, therby to set forth the most admirable excellency of his power

But let vs yet consider one reason more.</p>
            <p n="17">17. The office of high Priesthood, as partly hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared by that we haue said, and is euident by the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of <hi>S. Paul,</hi> appointing him for a meanes or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator<note place="margin">Tvvo prin cipall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</note> betweene God and man, consisteth principally in two thinges or partes: first in respect of that which he is to performe towardes God, as to his Superiour: secondly in the functions that he is to vse towardes the people, as inferiours and subiectes. The first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth in offering sacrifice, oblations, prayers and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession for the sinnes of the people, as already tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Christ our Sauiour out of the Apostle we haue declared. The second consisteth in the spirituall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, dignity, authority and functions therof, which our said high Priest Christ Iesus, as head &amp; high Priest of his Church, purchased with the sacrifice of his owne bloud, hath, and may exercise vpon the said Church for euer, for vnto him as our high Priest it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaineth not only to make intercession for his said Church, but to gouerne the same also, and to direct it by conuenient meanes vnto the end of their salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which he hath designed, and for this to make la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes, prescribe orders, appoint Sacramentes, ordaine<note place="margin">Christ a spirituall King by his Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood but not a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall.</note> spirituall tribunals of iudgment, giue sentence of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of the good from the bad, forgiue and retaine sinnes, which spirituall gouernment of soules belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to the office of high Priesthood, is a different
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:14593:92"/>
thing from the ciuill gouernment of temporall prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality, and yet is a Kingdome also in it self, but a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Kingdome ouer soules and not ouer bodies. And this had Christ our Sauiour togeather with his high Priesthood, according to the prediction and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of <hi>Daniel: Aspiciebam &amp; ecce quasi filius hominis &amp;c.</hi> 
               <q>I did<note place="margin">Dan. 7.</note> looke and behold there appeared as it were the Sonne of man, and God gaue vnto him power and honour, and a Kingdome, his power is an eternall power, and his Kingdome shall neuer be corrupted.</q> And so in the second Psalme, after he had said, <hi>I am made King by him vpon his holy Hill of Sion,</hi> he addeth presently to shew that it was a spirituall Kingdome: <hi>Praedicans praeceptum eius,</hi> my office is to preach his commandement, and many other authorities may be alledged to proue that Christ in that he was high Priest had supreame spirituall Kingly authority in like manner for gouerning of soules.</p>
            <p n="18">18.

therin:</hi> These examples are fraudulently heaped and hudled togeather by T.

                  <p n="27">27.

To which end is that seuere admonitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the second Psalme: <hi>Et nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>c Reges intelligite, &amp; erudimini qui iudicatis ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram: seruite Domino in timore, &amp; exultate ei cum tremore.

Princes, out of those disasterous euentes as fell to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers by Godes owne apointment or permission vnder the old Testament, and not the comparison of Myters and Crownes which this Minister ridiculously brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth in.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. Secondly may be noted, that in the execution of Godes iustice &amp; designement in this behalfe, he vsed<note place="margin">The true contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersy.</note> also oftentimes the help &amp; concurrence of both Prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes and Prophetes, &amp; other holy men, who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing may be presumed out of their said holy dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to haue abhorred such effusion of bloud, war, and other calamities, which by fulfilling Godes ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance made vnto them, either by secret inspiration or open commandment, were to ensue and follow, and consequently that all Priestes were not debarred from dealing in such affairs, when God required their coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration therin.</p>
                  <p n="29">29. All the question then is how, and when, and where, and by whome, and for what causes, and in what cases, &amp; with what circumstances, this restraint of Princes may be vsed, wherin I haue shewed aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly before, that the moderation prescribed by Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholickes is far greater, without comparison, then is that of the Protestantes, whether we respect either their doctrine or practice, of which both kindes we<note place="margin">Supr. c. 1. 4</note> haue before produced sufficient examples: and in this place the Authors most alledged by T.

And thus much for the first point, about exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples drawne from the times of the old Testament, out of which, little ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be vrged to the proofe or disproofe of this question, besides the two generall pointes by<note place="margin">The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and Kingly au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in the old lavv.</note> vs noted before. For to bring into disputation, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Priesthood or Kingly principality had the vpper hand in that law, is to small purpose, the matter being cleere, that as the Kinges (and so likewise their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, Iudges, and Gouernours before they had Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges) had the preheminence in all temporall affaires, so in spirituall: and such as concerned God imediatly, the were referred principally to Priestes, and the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Magistrate commaunded to heare them, to take the law of them, &amp; consequently also the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation therof, to repaire vnto them in consultation of doubtes, and to stand to their iudgment and defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition; that Priestes and Prophetes should consult
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:14593:98"/>
immediatly with God, and the Prince follow their word and direction.</p>
                  <p n="33">33. And albeit God did some-times vse for exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall guiding and direction of Priestes and Priestly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, the authority of good Kinges in those daies, especially when they were Prophetes also, as <hi>Dauid</hi> &amp; <hi>Salomon,</hi> in the correcting and remouing of some Prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes; yet this was extraordinary, and proueth not, that simply and absolutly Kingly dignity and authority was aboue Priesthood in that law, albeit also it be most true, which the Authors by this man heere alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <hi>Salmeron, Cunerus, Carerius</hi> and the rest doe note, that the Priesthood of the old Testament was nothing comparable to that of the new, this descending di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly from the person and office of Christ himself, and indued with farre higher and more powerfull spirituall authority for guiding of soules, then had the Priestes of the old law, which was but a figure of the new; &amp; therfore to argue from that to this, is a plaine fallacy, and abusing of the Reader.</p>
                  <p n="34">34.

Yet in one word to answere his comparison, we say, that both temporall, &amp; spirituall Magistrates may doe hurte both to body and soule: for as the temporall may preiudice also the soule, as now hath byn said; so may the spirituall afflict in like manner the body, as<note place="margin">Much lesse dangerous to haue one Pope vvithout all Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior, then many Princes.</note> when the Pope or Bishoppes doe burne Heretikes: so as in this respect, this distinction of T.

had so much care to prouide for the preuention therof in his Christian Church, for the conseruation of true faith, by the authority, vnion, visibility, &amp; succession of the said Church, and diligence of Doctores, Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, Synodes, Councels, and other meanes therin v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and by his assistance of infallibility to the head therof: which head though in respect of his eminent authority, he haue no Superiours to Iudge or chastise him, except in case of heresy, as hath byn said; yet hath he many and effectuall meanes wherby to be admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, informed, stirred vp, and moued: so as he being but one in the world, and furnished with these helpes, bringeth farre lesse danger, and inconuenience, then if all temporall Princes (who are many) had the like priuiledge and immunity.

                  <p n="62">62. As also this other point of no small or meane importance, to wit, that English Protestantes preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding temporall Princes to be supreame, and without Iudge or Superiour in matters of Religion, as well as ciuill and secular, they incurre a farre greater incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenience therby, then they would seeme to lay vpon vs. For that if any temporall Prince as Supreame in both causes, would take vpon him the approbation, or admission of any sect or heresy whatsoeuer, they haue no remedy at all according to the principles of their doctrine; wheras we say, the Pope in this case may and must be deposed by force of his subiectes, &amp; all Christian Princes ioined togeather against him: so as in place of one generall Pope, which in this case is vnder authority, they make so many particuler Popes, as are particuler Kings &amp; temporall Princes through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all Christendome, that are absolute, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently without all remedy for offences temporall or spirituall in manners or faith.</p>

First, for<note place="margin">Salmer. disp. 12. in Epistolas Pauli in gen. §. sed contra.</note> that <hi>Salmeron</hi> proueth the quite contrary in the place by this man quoted, to wit, that neuer Kinges were head of the Church or aboue Priestes by their ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Kingly authority in Ecclesiasticall matters, in the new or old Testament, and hauing proued the same largly, he commeth at length to set downe obiections to the contrary, and to solue &amp; answere them, saying: <hi>Sed contra hanc solidam veritatem &amp;c.</hi> 
               <q>But now against this sound truth by me hitherto confirmed, I know that many thinges may be obiected, which we are diligently to confute. First then may be obiected that Kinges in the old Testament did sometimes prescribe vnto Priestes what they were to doe in sacred thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, as also did put some negligent Priestes from the execution of their office. To which is answered: <hi>Vbi id euenisset, mirum esse non debere;</hi> If it had so fallen out, it had byn no maruaile: for that the Synagogue of the Iewes, albeit it conteined some iust men, yet was it called rather an earthly, then a heauenly Kingdome,<note place="margin">August. l. 19. contr. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p n="13">13. Secondly if we consider, either the English trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation heere set downe out of the wordes of <hi>Victoria,</hi>

For that <hi>Victoria</hi> hauing set downe his precedent generall proposition, for the exemption of Clergy men, that they were exempted <hi>Iure</hi> by Law, he passeth on to examine in his second proposition <hi>Quo iure,</hi> by what Law, diuine or humane they are exempted; and in his third, he holdeth that <hi>Aliqua
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:14593:115"/>
exemptio Clericorum est de iure Diuino:</hi> That some kinde of exemptions of Clergy men from ciuill power, is by diuine Law, and not humane only, and fourthly he commeth to this which heere is set downe by T.

            </p>
            <p n="14">14. These are the wordes of <hi>Victoria</hi> as they ly togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in him, and then after some argumentes interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, for his said conclusion, he addeth also this proofe: <q>That for so much as Clergy me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> besides this, that they are Ministers of the Church, are Citizens also of the Common-wealth, they are bound to obey the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall lawes of that Common-wealth or Prince in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall affaires;</q> and then ensueth the last reason (heere set downe in English by T. M.) in these wordes: <hi>More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer</hi> (saith <hi>Victoria</hi>) <hi>for that a King is King not only of laymen, but of Clergy-men also, therfore</hi> aliquo modo subiiciuntur ei, <hi>in some sort they are subiect vnto him:</hi> Which wordes <hi>aliquo modo</hi> in some sorte, the Minister leaueth out; and then it followeth immediatly in <hi>Victoria: And for that Clergy-men are not gouerned in temporall matters by Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall power, therfore they haue their temporall Prince, vnto whome they are bound to yeeld obedience in temporall affaires.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="15">15. And this is all that <hi>Victoria</hi> hath in this matter, &amp; in these very wordes. And let any man consider the patching, which T.

be noted which he citeth, and Englisheth as out of <hi>Victoria,</hi> to wit, <hi>the Clergy is subiect vnto the ciuill au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in temporall thinges, for such matter is not ruled by any power spirituall,</hi> wherby he would haue his Reader to imagine, that no spirituall power may haue authority to gouerne temporall matters; wheras the wordes of<note place="margin">Changing of nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiue cases.</note> 
               <hi>Victoria</hi> are: <hi>Clerici quantum ad temporalia non administran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur potestate Ecclesiastica, that Clergy men, for so much as apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth to temporall affaires, are not gouerned by Ecclesiasticall power, but by the temporall which there beareth rule:</hi> So as this fellow by a subtile sleight changing the nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue case from <hi>Clerici non administrantur</hi> to <hi>temporalia non administrantur,</hi> frameth his plaine demonstration out of plaine cosenage and forgery.

what authority <hi>S. Leo</hi> the Pope aboue eleuen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares gone ascribed vnto <hi>Leo</hi> the Emperour in matters spirituall and Ecclesiasticall.

or contradict the Church, but it is inough that he doe contradict the same <hi>re ipsa,</hi> indeed, knowing that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which he defendeth to be against the authority of the said vniuersall Church, albeit he be not indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to this belief with a direct will to impugne the Church, but either by desire of glory, or other induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</q> so as indeed the malice of this sinne is consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated in the vnderstanding and not in the will.</p>

                  <p n="30">30. These wordes also of <hi>S. Paul</hi> to the <hi>Hebrewes: Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisedech</hi>

By all which is seene that sometimes of necessity wee must admit some vse of Equiuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without lying, for otherwise many places of the Scriptures themselues and of other holy mens wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings &amp; doings cannot be well vnderstood, or defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as afterwardes more at large shall be shewed.</p>
                  <p n="32">32. But now to passe no further in the recitall of more argumentes to this purpose, we may conclude with that common doctrine of Schole-men taken<note place="margin">August. in Psal. 5. 22. quaest. 2.</note> out of <hi>S.

And then concludeth: <hi>Non est ergo culpandum aliquando verum tacere &amp;c.</hi> It is not therfore to be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended if a man sometimes doe not vtter a truth; which hardly can be performed in sundry cases with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some amphibology or Equiuocation of speech, &amp; consequently that this may be without lying. And heerof one example may serue for all, taken out of <hi>Hieremy</hi> the Prophet, who hauing had a long confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in secret with <hi>Sedechias</hi> the King in <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> &amp; told him many thinges of the will of God about his voluntary yeelding to the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> and army of <hi>Nabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chodonosor,</hi> King <hi>Sedechias</hi> in conclusion said thus vnto him: <hi>Nullus sciat verba haec &amp;c.</hi>

               <hi>this conflict, and enter vpon our Equiuocatour to conuince him a grosse lier,</hi> wherby yow see his great confidence in the cause, which I cannot ascribe to any thing, more then to ignorance. For if he had vnderstood well, or weighed the points before laid downe, or these other which presently we are to adioine, I doe not see how he could haue spoken so confidently in so bad a cause.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For what? will he hold that all kind of Equiuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is lying? If he doe, he forgetteth himself, for he granted in the very next precedent page, that one sort of Equiuocation (which afterward we shall proue to be the only) is no ly. <q>For that hauing set downe, as it were, for a principle or foundation of all his Treatise,<note place="margin">Conf. p. 48</note> what we doe hold in this behalf, he saith, that we doe teach a double Equiuocation, the one mentall when any thing is reserued in mind, differing from that which outwardly is expressed, as when a Catholicke being demaunded, whether he haue any Priest in his<note place="margin">Tvvo sortes of Equiuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</note> house, may answere by Equiuocation that he hath none, reseruing in his mind <hi>that he hath none whome he is bound to vtter or discouer:</hi>
               </q> the other kind is verball, when one word (he should haue said also speach) shall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port two or more significations, as if a man should say <hi>yow goe to fast,</hi> or <hi>yow may not ly in my house,</hi> the word <hi>fast,</hi> may signify either fasting or hasty going, and <hi>lying</hi> may signify either remaining, or telling vntruth.

               <hi>Dogge,</hi> the speach is doubtfull and equiuocall, for that the word <hi>Dogge</hi> hath a triple signification, to wit a domesticall dogge, a dogge fish in the sea, or a signe in

            <p n="3">3. Now then these two sortes of Equiuocations being set downe, T. M. is forced presently to grant, that the later sort, whether it be in word or speech, is no ly of it self; for who would say, that a man lyeth in vsing the different significations of any word or speach? Who will affirme that he saith an vntruth, if<note place="margin">Verball E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no ly.</note> for example, he being of a hoate &amp; sickly complexion, and fearing the Canicular-dayes, should say, <hi>I feare the dogge,</hi> meaning the dangerous influence of that cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiall signe, or of those Canicular-dayes: so as now by his owne confession, (for in effect he confesseth it in this place, and can doe no other) this second part or member of Equiuocation, is no ly; notwithstanding perhaps the hearer should be deceaued, &amp; vnderstand the speaker to meane of a domesticall dogge, when he meaneth the celestiall.

            <p n="5">5. Of the third sort he alleadgeth many examples, and among other this: <hi>Possibile est sedentem ambulare, &amp; non scribentem scribere:</hi> That one sitting may walke, and one not writing may write, in which sentences the wordes being taken separatly and a part out of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, they haue but simple and plaine significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but being compounded in this manner as they ly, haue manifest Equiuocation and amphibology in them, by reason of composition. For if wee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand that a man sitting, while he sitteth, can walke, or while he writeth not, can write, which is, as Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians say, <hi>in sensu composito,</hi> it is not possible: but if we vnderstand it <hi>in sensu diuiso</hi> that he that sitteth now may walke afterward, or he that writeth not now, hath power to write afterward, no man will deny it; and yet are neither of those thinges falsities or lies but only Equiuocall or amphibologicall propositions, that may be true in diuers senses, and yet deceaue the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or hearer if he stand not attent.</p>

but that there is a true internall speach of the mind, affirming or denying, approuing or reiecting, consen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or repugning aswell as in externall speach, and consequently are there true mentall propositions to be graunted and allowed. And in this I thinke <hi>M.

               <p n="33">33. But this is somwhat more perspicuous if the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere be ambiguous, as when <hi>Cicero</hi> was demanded by his aduersary in the cause of <hi>Clodius</hi> slaine by <hi>Milo,</hi> whome he defended, what time of the day <hi>Clodius</hi> was slaine, to wit before noone or after, thinking therby to intrappe <hi>Milo, Tully</hi> answered <hi>serò,</hi> which word sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying both <hi>towardes the Euening</hi> as also <hi>to late, Cicero</hi>

               <p n="34">34. And the like answere was that of the same Orator to a base fellow that hauing byn a cooke came<note place="margin">See Quint. l. 6. Instit.

               <p n="35">35. And finally I might alleadge all the examples that Orators doe vse and prescribe vnder the figure called by <hi>Cicero, Reticentia,</hi> and by the <hi>Grecians</hi> APO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SIÓPESIS, as <hi>Quid plura?</hi> What shall I say more, or what shall I complaine more? which verbes say, complaine, or the like were reserued in mind by the speaker, and yet is it but one proposition; so that of <hi>Virgil, Quos Ego; sed motos praestat &amp;c.</hi> Whome I, if I had<note place="margin">Virgil <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p n="36">36. But if we would alleadge all the diuine that might be cited out of the Scriptures, there would be<note place="margin">Diuine examples.</note> no end, as that among other before mentioned out of the Psalme: <hi>Impij non resurgent in iudicio,</hi> wicked men<note place="margin">Psal. 1.</note> shall not rise againe in iudgment, which though it seeme a whole proposition; yet is it in deed but a part, and the other part was reserued in the Prophets mind, and expounded afterward by <hi>S.

least degree therof, we haue declared partly in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Chapter, and for clearing the matter more in this place, it will be necessary to set downe briefly both the definitions of truth, falsity, lying, periury, deceipt, and the like, &amp; then to consider, whether our former proposition doe incurre any of the foresaid imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or no?</p>

               <p n="42">42. The first sort or kind of truth is when that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> which is spoken is conforme to the thing it selfe, though not to the mind of the speaker; as if one should say <hi>my Father is dead,</hi> if he be dead, though the speaker thinke not so, then is this speach conforme to the thing, and it is truth in this first kind.</p>
               <p n="43">43. The second sort of truth is, when our speach is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> conforme to our vnderstanding, though not to the thing it selfe; as If I thinking that my Father is dead, should say so, though he be not dead in deed, yet is it truth in respect of my vnderstanding, though in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the thing it selfe it be not so; and in this sort: may a man speake false without a ly.</p>
               <p n="44">44. The third sort is when our speach agreeth both <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> with the one, and the other, and is conforme both to our vnderstanding and the thing it selfe; as when I say, <hi>that my Father is dead,</hi> and do thinke so, and it is so in deed; and this is the most perfect kind of truth in speach, when there is an adequation of the speakers vnderstanding with the thing spoken, as the former definition prescribed.</p>
               <p n="45">45. And in contrary manner, there are three sortes<note place="margin">3. Sortes of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="338" facs="tcp:14593:185"/>
to the vnderstanding of the speaker. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, a formall falsity, when the speach agreeth not with the mind or meaning of the speaker, though it doe with the thing meant or spoken. The third is when the speach agreeth neither with the vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the speaker nor with the thing it selfe, &amp; this is a complete falsity, as if my Father not being dead, nor I thinking him to be dead, should say notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing he is dead, and these two last kindes of falsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or either of them doe make a ly, and not the first: kind alone, for that the essence and formality of a ly requireth that the speach doe disagree from the mind and vnderstanding of the speaker: in which sense <hi>S. Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>Non facit linguam ream nisi mens rea,</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing<note place="margin">Aug. ser. 28. de ver. Apostoli.</note> maketh the tongue guilty of a ly, but a guilty mind, meaning one thing and speaking another.</p>
               <p n="46">46. And this same distinction of truth and falsity is ser downe by <hi>S. Anselme</hi> in other wordes, thus: <hi>Sicut est veritas triplex, rei, cognitionis, &amp; signationis, sic etiam est falsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ansel. in dialogo de veritate cap. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>triplex, rei, cognitionis &amp; signationis, seu enunciationis:</hi> As there are three kinds of truth, one of the thing it selfe, another of the inward vnderstanding, and a third of outward signification, so is there like wise a triple fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of the thing it selfe, of the knowledge or vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, and of signification or enunciation. The first is in the thinges, the second is in our mind, the third in the voice or signe that vttereth: wherof he that will see more, let him read our foresaid learned Countreyman <hi>Alexander</hi> of <hi>Hales</hi> in the first Part of his <hi>Theologicall Summe</hi> in his sixteene question of falsity, and first member.</p>
               <p n="47">47. And heerby it appeareth that <hi>mendacium,</hi> a ly, is a particuler <hi>species</hi> or kind of falsity, in so much as euery speach that is false, is no ly, but only that which hath the essentiall point before mentioned of dissenting from the mind and vnderstanding of the speaker.

if I thinking, as hath byn said, <hi>that my Father is dead,</hi> should say so, though he were not dead, yet I make no lye, but only materially, which may be without any sinne at all, and hereupon are there diuers definitions, and descriptions set downe by Doctors, and holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of lyes, and lying: first <hi>S.

And when the Iewes were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:14593:189"/>
with those other word s of Christ, <hi>Dissolue this Temple and I will build it vp againe in three dayes,</hi> the Sonne<note place="margin">Ioan. 2.</note> of God cannot be truly said to haue deceaued them, for that he spake that which was truth in his owne sense, and permitted only the other to be decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: so in the proposed case, the vniust examiners are only permitted to be deceaued, for that the Priest his principall intent is not <hi>intentio fallendi,</hi> intention of deceiuing, as the definition of lying prescribeth, or as <hi>S. Augustine</hi> in another place saith <hi>fallendi cupiditas,</hi> a desire of deceiuing, but rather <hi>euadendi desiderium,</hi> a desire to escape, and defend himselfe. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as if he should goe to one of himselfe without necessity, and tell him that he is no Priest, he being a Priest, might be argued of lying, for that his principall intent may be supposed to haue byn <hi>cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piditas fallendi,</hi> an appetite of deceiuing; so heere the thing being euident that <hi>primaria respondent is intentio,</hi> the first and principall intention of the answerer is not to hurt or impugne others, but to defend and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer himselfe vnlawfully pressed, as he presumeth, that his defence is by speaking a truth in his owne mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning (which meaning and vnderstanding of the spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker is the chiefe rule and measure of truth, as before yow haue heard:) it followeth euidently, that it can be no ly, nor deception on his part, though by his manner of answering they deceiue themselues, which is not to be imputed to any fault of his.

houre of Iudgment,</hi> is an amphibologicall and Equiuocall mixt proposition, conteyning a mentall reseruation of our Sauiour, not expressed in his wordes, which ouerthroweth and vtterly vndoeth <hi>Th.

                  <p n="51">51. <hi>It will not</hi> (saith he) <hi>be pertinent to oppose the other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of Fathers, who as your</hi> Maldonate <hi>saith, were many, expounding this text thus, that Christ as he was man knew not the day and houre.</hi> This is his first struggle, and if it be impertinent, as himselfe confesseth, why doth he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge it, but for lacke of better defence, and that it is impertinent in deed, is euident; for that this exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of some Fathers alleadged by him, doth rather proue that there were diuers reseruations in Christes wordes, then that there was none at all, which he should proue. Wherfore it falleth out to <hi>Thomas Morton</hi> in this case, as when playing a bad game at Tables that is past recouery, he should say, this game is lost which way soeuer I play it, and yet will I play it out with what shame soeuer, rather then giue it vp. Let vs see then what play he maketh.</p>

Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stines au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged by F. Garnet examined.</note> speach thus: <hi>But the question is</hi> (saith he) whether the former exposition of <hi>S. Augustine</hi> and others doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply any mentall Equiuocation, and because <hi>Garnet</hi> at his arraignment did select only <hi>S. Augustine</hi> of all the Fathers, we will appeale to <hi>S. Augustine</hi> for answere to them all, by whose testimony it doth appeare, that
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:14593:207"/>
when our Sauiour said, <hi>I know not the day,</hi> signifying <hi>vt dicam vobis,</hi> to tell vnto yow, this clause wherby he meant to conceale the time, was not concealed from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who though they were by the sense of the speach held in ignorance not to know the day; yet were they not ignorant of the sense of the speach, which was, <hi>I may not let yow know it.</hi>
                     </q> So he. And doe yow vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand him? or doth he not labour asmuch to hold yow in ignorance of his meaning, as Christ did his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the day of iudgment; but let vs draw him out of this affected darkenes.</p>
                  <p n="53">53. First he saith the question is, (and he saith well) whether the former exposition of <hi>S. Augustine,</hi> &amp; other Fathers doe imply any mentall Equiuocation or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mentall reseruation, which maketh Equiuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or doubtfulnes of meaning; and I see not how<note place="margin">The defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of Equiuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as heere it is vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood.</note> he can deny it, sor that the proposition, <hi>Christ knoweth not of the day of Iudgment</hi> is false, without some reserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but with the reseruation gathered vpon <hi>S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stines</hi> exposition, to wit, that he knew it not to make them know it, that is to say, to vtter it vnto them, it is true, ergo <hi>S. Augustines</hi> exposition doth imply and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare vnto vs a manifest mentall reseruation, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently also an Equiuocation. For that as before we haue defined the matter, Equiuocation or amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bology in this our controuersy, is nothing els, but when a speach is partly vttered in wordes, and partly reserued in mind, by which reseruation the sense of the proposition may be diuers.</p>
                  <p n="54">54. Secondly wheras <hi>Thomas Morton</hi> saith, that <hi>Father Garnet</hi> at his arraignment did select only <hi>S. Augustine,</hi> of all other Fathers to depend vpon, concerning the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer exposition of Christes wordes, and therfore that he also will appeale to <hi>S. Augustine</hi> for answere to them all, it is a shift, therby to auoid the authority of all the other Fathers, both in this and the other expositions
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:14593:207"/>
before mentioned, all which doe conclude against him, as hath byn said, that there is a mentall reserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Christes wordes, without which vnderstood,<note place="margin">F. Garnets alleadging S. August. at his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</note> the proposition is false. Neither did <hi>Father Garnet</hi> so select <hi>S. Augustines</hi> authority at his arraignme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to stand vpon, as that he left any way the other Fathers, but being pressed to be briefe, he named him for all, and no small maruaile it is that at such an arraignment he had leysure, or list to name any Father, or other proofe at all, knowing how vnequally the same would be heard after the hydeous clamours of so many Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters out of bookes, speeches, &amp; pulpittes against that doctrine: but sure I am, that if <hi>Henry Garnet,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Morton</hi> had met togeather at any equall barre out of arraignment, to plead and dispute this matter, there would haue byn as little cause for <hi>Thomas</hi> to haue triumphed of that disputation, as there is like to be now of this his writing; and therfore he might haue spared him heere if he had pleased.</p>
                  <p n="55">55. But his third act of manhood in his defence is most notorious, where hauing fled all other Fathers, as yow see, to sticke to <hi>S. Augustine,</hi> he bringeth in <hi>S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> wholy against himselfe, as now yow shall see, though he endeauour by some, obscure words to dazle the sense of his hearer. For in the words of <hi>Saint Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> by him alleadged he saith thus: <hi>Nescientem se esse</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Aug. vbi suprà.</note> 
                     <hi>dixit, quia illos nescientes occultando faciebat.</hi> Christ said he was ignorant of the day of Iudgement, for that he made them ignorant therof, by hyding the same from them. And in another place: <hi>Hoc nescit filius quod nescien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes facit, hoc est, quod non ita sciebat, vt tunc discipulis indicaret:</hi> the Sonne of God is said not to know that, which he maketh other men not to know, that is to say, that he knoweth it not so, as he would vtter it at that time to his Disciples. And for proofe of this exposition <hi>S. Augustine</hi> alleadgeth that place of <hi>S. Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians:
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:14593:208"/>
neque enim iudicaui me scire aliquid inter vos, nisi Iesum</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Cor. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>Christum, &amp; hunc Crucisixum:</hi> Neither did I esteeme my<note place="margin">S. August. authority vvholy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst T. M. that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leageth the same.</note> selfe to know any thing among yow, but only Iesus Christ, and him crucified, where <hi>S. Paul</hi> saith he knew no more of that thing, for that he thought it not time to vtter vnto them any more: which is so plaine for our purpose, as <hi>Thomas Morton</hi> would neuer haue allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged it, but vpon plaine despaire of the game lost in deed. For what is more conforme then this to our answere obiected by him, <hi>I am no Priest to vtter it vnto yow: I know not where such a Priest is,</hi> that is, I make yow not to know it by concealing the same, for that I am not bound, nor is it expedient to vtter it.</p>
                  <p n="56">56. Now then heere yow see <hi>Thomas Morton</hi> in the dust, as one fighting against himselfe. For to cauill, &amp; quarrell, as he doth afterward, that the Apostles are to be presumed to haue vnderstood this reserued mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, aswell as <hi>S. Augustine, S. Ambrose,</hi> and other Fathers<note place="margin">Shiftes confuted.</note> did, and that if they did, then it was no Equiuocation: and further that it were blasphemy to say that Christ did Equiuocate with his Apostles; all these shiftes (I say) are but ridiculous. For first it importeth not to our question, whether the Apostles vnderstood the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret meaning of Christ in this deniall, or not, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whether there were any reseruation, &amp; whether the speach of it selfe were ambiguous, and Equiuocall to the hearers (who were many besides the Apostles) by reason of this reseruation, and all Christians haue byn and shall be to the worldes end. And then if this so, it is no blasphemy to say, that Christ did Equiuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, that is to say, speake doubtfully, but rather it is blasphemy by excluding all Equiuocation, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the same for lying, as <hi>Morton</hi> is forced to doe, or to say nothing.</p>
                  <p n="57">57. And lastly where he concludeth the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<note place="margin">Of Doctor Genesius, Sepulueda</note> by the testimony of our Doctor <hi>Genesius</hi> as he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:14593:208"/>
him, I haue told before how he is ours, and how in some sort he may in this controuersy be called his, though he detested his Religion, as by his workes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth. Ours he is, as in all other points of Religion, so in the substantiall and principall point of this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, for that he defendeth the vse of Equiuocation in concealing some secrettes, but denieth it in others, wherin he fauoureth somewhat the aduerse party, with small ground, as in the next Chapter shall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared. But what saith this Doctor <hi>Genesius? He will tell</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Genes. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulu.</note> 
                     <hi>yow</hi> (saith <hi>Morton</hi>) <hi>that this sense</hi> (of this text of Scripture)<note place="margin">l. de rat. dicend. te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stim. c. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>which yow conceale, is not only contrary to the sentence of all Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but also against all common sense.</hi> And is this possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? Will <hi>Sepulueda</hi> deny all those Fathers alleadged by me before for our interpretation to be Fathers? will he say that their exposition is contrary to all common sense? Doth not <hi>Genesius</hi> himselfe in the very Chapter heere cited alleadge both <hi>S. Hierome</hi> and <hi>S. Augustine</hi> for this interpretation, and alloweth the same? What sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meles dealing then is this of our Minister to charge <hi>Genesius</hi> with such folly or impiety which he neuer thought of? For <hi>Genesius</hi> denieth not either the sense, or interpretation of the place, and much lesse saith, <hi>that it is contrary to the sentence of the Fathers,</hi> and least of all <hi>to common sense,</hi> but denieth only the application therof for vse and practice to certaine cases, wherin he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth not Equiuocation, and saith, that vpon this interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to bring in such a new law were great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inconuenient (wherin afterward notwithstanding we shall shew him to haue byn greatly deceaued) and his Latin wordes are: <hi>Contra non modò veterum &amp; grauis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simorum doctorum, sed communem hominem sensum, quasi legem inducere:</hi> to bringe in, as it were, a law not only against the iudgment of ancient, and most graue Schoole- Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors (for of them only he speaketh in that place) but also against the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sense or opinion of men. This
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:14593:209"/>
is <hi>Genesius</hi> his speach, wherin though his iudgment <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> reiected by other Schoolmen as singuler and parado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xicall in this point, as after shall be declared; yet is he egregiously abused by <hi>Morton,</hi> who first maketh him<note place="margin">Genesius much abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by T.M.</note> to say of the interpretation, and sense of this place of Scripture, that which he speaketh only of the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation therof, to vse and practice in tribunalles. And secondly he maketh him to discredit the Fathers which himselfe alleadgeth: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he Englisheth ancient Fathers for ancient Schoole-Doctors: and last of all addeth <hi>consensum</hi> of his owne, leauing out <hi>hominum,</hi> to make it sound common sense, and other such abuses, which any man may see by conferring the place. And these are other manner of sinnes, then simple Equiuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, if the art of falsifying or forgery be any sinne with him at all, and so much for this place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p n="58">58. The third place alleadged, and pretended to be answered by this man, is that of <hi>S.

                     <hi>well vnderstood of the Apostles as of themselues.</hi> Heere be two pointes insinuated, if you consider them attentyuely, the first, that the ancient Fathers did suppose, that whatsoeuer Christs meaning was in these wordes to his brethren (whom <hi>Mortö</hi> calleth heere the Apostles) they did (the said kinsmen of our Sauiour) vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the same aswell then, to wit before the ghospell was written, and before the holy ghost was giuen, as the said Christian Fathers and learned Doctors did afterward by the learning, and light they had from the spirit and tradition of the Church: which propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition if he were put to proue in the presence of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men, I doubt not but that he would quickly be in a poore and pittifull plight.</p>
                  <p n="68">68. The second thing which by this his answere he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> would haue vs vnderstand is, that if these brethren or kinsmen of Christ, did any way conceaue our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours meaning, then was there no reseruation at all, for that as he saith, <hi>our ioyned reseruation is alwayes supposed to</hi>

                  </note> many thinges of those which before we haue touched concerning the said defendant, do appertaine also to witnesses. For first the common opinion and consent of Deuines is, that when any man is called to beare witnesse against another, before a lawful Iudge, who proceedeth rightfully, and according to forme of law doth demaund the truth of him, he is bound to vtter the same sincerely, and wholy vnder payne of mortall sinne, for the same reasons which we haue alleadged before, concerning the defendant; to wit, that the Iudge being in the place of almighty God, &amp; of the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth, &amp; demaunding him iustly, he is bound by the law of Iustice, subordination, and obedience, to reueale vnto him the sincere truth of all that he is demaunded, and knoweth in that behalfe.</p>
               <p n="25">25. Yea &amp; further then this, he doth not only sinne mortally, as hath byn said, in denying, or concealing the truth or any parte therof necessary to be vttered: but is also bound in conscience to make restitution to the partie endamaged by his concealment of all those
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:14593:229"/>
losses either in fame, estimation, goods or otherwise which he hath suffered, and might haue auoyded, if the other had confessed the truth.

And this is the seuerity of Catholicke Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, about obligation of witnesses for telling the truth, when they are called, and examined by a right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Iudge, extant in all our Authors, as hath bene said; and I would gladly know of <hi>T. Morton</hi> what his Deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity doth define, and prescribe in this case, and what his Authors haue written therof for the practice; yea what the practice it self is there daily with him, in all mens sight: which point I thinke rather expedient to leaue to euery mans particuler knowledge, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, to thinke &amp; consider, then here to set downe, what fruites their new Ghospell hath brought forth in this matter about vnconscionable witnesses.</p>
               <p n="26">26. But on the other side our Doctors say, that when the Iudge is not lawfull, or that he enquireth of secretes, which appertayne not to his iurisdiction, nor that forme of law doth permit him so to enquire, then the same Authors are of opinion, that he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to answere, for that the Iudge hath no Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to demaund him; yea although first he hath sworne to answere directly, for that, that oath did presuppose that he should answere directly to that which the other should iustly demaund of him, and therfore in this case he may vse the same kinds of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, which before haue byn touched in the case of the defendant, that is to say, he may hold his peace,<note place="margin">Hovv vvitnesses may deny or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And the same they determine, when any man is called, and commanded to sweare by his lawfull Iudge, and Superiour, and in a lawfull cause: and he that doth otherwise, though it were to the sauing of his owne, or another mans life, doth commit periury.</p>

As for example, when a priest denyeth to any Iudge that he knoweth of any Cryme in Confession, which is a diuine iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and tribunall, it is vnderstood by the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of his office, that no such crymes are to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of in that humane court or iudgement.

            <p n="3">3. To hasten then to the matter, I am first to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish the reader, that wheras this Minister doth take vpon him to confute a certaine Catholicke ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscript Treatise, made in defence of <hi>Equiuocation,</hi> and intercepted (as it seemeth) by them, I could neuer yet come to the sight therof, and therfore must be forced to admitt, what he saith out of it, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolment, heere a peece, &amp; there a peece; though there

His argumentes for the first are these. 1. The definition of a lye. 2. The definition of Equiuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. 3. The description of lying. 4. The nature of periury. 5. Truth God, lying the Diuell. 6. Scriptures Fathers Pagans. 7. Signe, interpretations, coyne, Giges ring. And for the second conclusion he bringeth 4. ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentes. 1. The forme of an oath. 2. The end of an oath. 3. <hi>A minore</hi> from the lesse to the more. 4. <hi>A pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,</hi> or from thinges equall. And now shall you see one by one, how equally vaine, and of no force all these argumentes be.</p>

               <p>And then by an other inference againe he might<note place="margin">The syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisme of T.

For that his first <hi>Maior</hi> proposition can neuer be proued, to wit, <hi>That the competency of God by whom we sweare maketh euery one competent Iudges to whom we sweare,</hi> that is to say, for so much as God by whom we sweare is competent Iudge of all, this maketh euery one to whome we sweare by God, to be our competent and lawfull Iudge, which is most absurd, euen in common sense. For that a man may sweare (for exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple) to a theefe or murderer by God, for sauing of his life, as also to a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon queane, yea, and to the dyuell himselfe, and yet this maketh not the murderer, the queane, or the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell to be his competent, and lawfull Iudge, or giueth lawfull iurisdiction, so as he is bound to answere di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to whatsoeuer they demand, or sweare to their intention if he should be compelled by them. And the like in other such examples wherof euery man may frame infinte store vnto himself, at his pleasure: and the reason of this is, that albeit in euery oath God be lawfull and supreame Iudge, to discerne whether I haue a true meaning of mine Oath in my mynd: yet this doth not make the other to whome I sweare my lawfu<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="1">HITHERTO we haue declared, and made manifest (as I suppose) that all Equiuocation is not lying, both for that the definition of a lye agreeth not ther vnto, &amp; for that Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and many of his seruantes both in the old and new Testament haue vpon iust occasions vsed the same, and the common consent of Catholicke Deuynes and Lawyers haue allowed, and confirmed the lawfulnes therof in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> declared. Mentall Equiuocation is, when any speach hath, or may haue a double sense, not by any double significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or composition of the wordes themselues, but only by some reseruation of mynd in the speaker, wherby his meaning is made different fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that sense which the wordes that are vttered do beare, or yeeld without that reseruation.

               </note> though not properly, yet in a generall manner may be called Equiuocation, as I haue said, for that the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer is alwayes wrongfully deceyued, or intended to be deceaued by some falsity, which is knowne to be such by the speaker, and consequently is playne lying: and for that lying hath byn shewed also before to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided into two sortes, the one a materiall lye, when the thing spoken is false in it selfe, but not so vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood<note place="margin">

This kynd of Equiuocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which really is a lye, must haue also the same subdiuisio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, so as the one sort therof may be called a materiall lying Equiuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the other a formall: and so much worse, as a formall lye is in it selfe (which alwayes is sinne) then a materiall (which oftentymes may be without sinne of the speaker:) by so much is a formall lying Equiuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation worse, then a materiall. We shal giue examples of both that shall make all playne.</p>
            <p n="5">5. If one should say to me that my Father is dead, thinking in deed that he is dead, though he be a liue, it were a materiall lye, as before hath byn declared, for that in deed my Father is not dead, though he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps that made the lye may haue said it without sinne, for that he thought it so: and I say (<hi>perhaps</hi>) for that in some case ignorance could not excuse him, if it were a matter wherof he were bound to know the truth, &amp; might with diligence haue learned the same. But if he should say, <hi>my Father is dead,</hi> knowing in deed that he is not dead, and meaning to deceiue me ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, this is a formall lye and alwayes sinfull, either ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall or mortall, according to the importance of the matter, wherin the lye is made.

The other sorte of false Equiuocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> called <hi>formall,</hi> is when the hearer conceyueth any false thing vpon the speach of another, which other know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it also a be false, and so vttereth a lye against his owne knowledge, and conscience.

And wheras the number and variety of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke writers is so great as the world seeth, it were no great labour to shew it in some, if that spirite did raigne among them, as it doth in Protestant writers, out of whom great volumes might be framed of this one point, if a man would imbrace them all through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all nations: But I meaning to speake of English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and those very few in respect of the multitude, and not hauing al their workes by meat this present, am forced only to vse some few notes taken heerto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore out of their books, which notwitstanding shall suffice for this short view, which we pretend.

And as we haue shewed the same in this article; so might we in all the rest, if time and place did permit, but this is sufficient to proue, in my opinion, that the protestation of <hi>M.

               <p n="26">26. The fifth reason is, for that we see by experience<note place="margin">The fifth reason.</note> that all other English Protestant writers, succeeding <hi>M.

If therfore you bring vs what some one Father hath thought, or what the Fathers vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersally altogeather haue deliuered, the same, except it be approued by testimonyes of scriptures, auayleth nothing, it gayneth nothing, it conuinceth nothing.

               <p n="74">74. The first was that he had falsified the Schole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Doctor<note place="margin">In the french printed Actes fol. 34.</note> 
                  <hi>Ioannes Scotus,</hi> alleadging him as though he had doubted of the Reall-presence, for that hauing proposed the question, <hi>whether Christ were really in the Sacrament, vnder the formes of bread and wyne,</hi> he did accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the fashion of Scholes, make arguments to the contrary, saying: <hi>Videtur quòd non,</hi> it seemeth that he is not so there, for these and these reasons, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he solueth and holdeth the contrary position for true, and Catholike, to wit, that Christs body is really there, wherupon the sentence of the Iudges

            <p n="1">AND now, gentle reader, hauing brought this Treatise to an end, and iustified (as I hope) our Catholicke doctrine in the eyes and Iudgments of all indifferent men, from the two odious imputations of <hi>Rebellion</hi> and <hi>Equiuocation,</hi> iniuriouslie cast vpon the same by the malice of <hi>Thomas Morton;</hi> there remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth nothing, but that I conclude this our small la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, with an exhortation to all Catholicke people, not only to abstayne from the first, which is vtterly vnlawfull (I meane the attempting of any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary

For as the holy Apostle in two seuerall places affirmeth to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> in cases not much vnlike to this about mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of scandall: <hi>Omnia mihi licent, sed non omnia expediunt:</hi>

               <hi>edificant;</hi> All things are lawfull vnto me, but all things do not edifye: So I say in this case, that albeit a man may without breach of truth, or offence of almighty God in certayne cases, equiuocate, or vse a doubtfull speach for a good and necessary end, either in oath, or out of oath, though the hearer doe not alwayes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand it, or be deceyued therwith, and that many holy men haue done the same, yea Christ himselfe, that is the example, and paterne of all holinesse and truth in speach, as by many examples before at large hath byn declared: yet considering the tymes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition therof, wherin Catholicks at this day liue in England, the offence, and scandall which Protestants, and some others, that vnderstand not the lawfulnes therof, or will not vnderstand the same, do receyue, or raise thervpon; my wish and counsell to Catholickes should be to vse the benefit of this liberty most spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly euen in lawfull thinges, and neuer but vpon great and vrgent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p n="2">2. And the reasons of this my wish and counsell are<note place="margin">The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons vvhy Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickes ought to vse the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Equiuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation sparingly.</note> principally the two already touched: The one the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyding of scandall euen with the Aduersary himself: and that as Catholicke Religion is the only true in

doctrine, so the practice also therof in conuersation; should not only be in all truth, and sincerity <hi>re ipsa,</hi> in very deed; but in opinion likewise, and estimation of others, in so much as the word of a Catholicke man ought to weigh more then the oath of an other, and the oath, or promise of a Catholicke, more then any band, or obligation of an other, which for the most parte I doubt not, but is so already taken in England. For that albeit by this doctrine before declared about <hi>Equiuocation,</hi> men do know that Catholickes in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne cases may vse the same: yet know they also that the said cases are straitly limited with many excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and that in common conuersation, as in buying selling, traffique, and the like, Equiuocation may not be<note n="*" place="margin">See of these thinges before &amp; namely Cap. 7.

               </gap>, or preiudice of any man: and that in Iudgments and tribunals, where most vse therof doth fall out, all lawyers, Iudges and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates do know in Catholicke Countryes, wherin the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> may vse Equiuocation, &amp; wherin not, and consequently truth &amp; Iustice can suffer no wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g therby. And moreouer they know, as before hath byn said, that the obligation of a Catholicke man, is so great to auoyde all kynd of lyes, whether veniall, or mortall, as for the gayning of a world no one is wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly and willingly to be committed: which acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt I doubt whether men of other sectes and Religion do make or noe. So as though already I perswade my self, that Catholicke people stand in good conceipt with all sortes of men, for their truth in concionable and vpright dealing; euen with those which endeauour most in this point to slaunder them: yet would I wish the same to be confirmed more daylie by factes in res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of this new calumniation raysed against them of the liberty of Equiuocation. And this of the first reason.</p>
            <p n="3">3. My other reason is, as before hath byn insinuated,
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:14593:290"/>
in regard of the tyme present, which being a tyme of tryall &amp; persecution, requireth at Catholickes hands, a more perfect Confession of their faith, and of all matters belonging thervnto, then at other tymes. And albeit in the former Treatise among the Cases reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, wherin <hi>Equiuocation</hi> may not be vsed, confession of faith be expresly and in the first place excepted, so as therin no doublenes or doubtfulnes may be vsed: yet no man can deny but many factes and cases may fall out, concerning matters of Religion not tending to confession (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> in tyme of persecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) wherin a man may or perhaps also must by obligation, if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise he cannot auoyd the wrong &amp; violence that<note place="margin">Hovv a Priest may somtymes yeeld of his right vvith more me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</note> is offred to himself or others, vse Equiuocal speaches, for concealing of that which in conscience he cannot vtter. But whersoeuer this obligation is not, there my wish is, as now I haue said, that Catholicke people, but especially Priestes, whose example must instruct the rest, should yeald also of their right for encrease of their merite, and crowne in heauen, and vse all play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and sincerity in speach, and free discouering, not only of their religion, but also of their state, where it is hurtfull to none, but to themselues: which yet I speake in that sense, and with that limitation, which the holy Apostle did, when he said: <hi>That he gaue coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell</hi>

               <hi>of himselfe, but no precept of our Lord.</hi> And for that this whole Treatise of Equiuocation hath proceeded vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that question so often before repeated, <hi>VVhether a Priest being taken, may deny himselfe to be a Priest, or no,</hi> I shall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> downe dyuers circumstances, and considerations of the Case, wherby also shal be made more playne, what my meaning is in this behalfe.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When a Priest commeth first into England with full intent and resolution to offer his life if there be need, for the confession of Catholicke Religion, and is taken afterward, &amp; brought before the Magistrate,
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:14593:290"/>
either he is taken in some mans house, of whose ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw<note place="margin">Diuers cases fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling out in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of priests.</note> he must be the cause if he confesse that he is a priest, or be being taken forth of any house; yet hath he cause to suspect, and perswade himselfe, that it may be knowne afterward by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fession of others, that are also taken, or may be taken, that he belongeth to such, or such a house; &amp; in these two cases there is no doubt but that if he thinke, that his denying of himselfe to be a priest, may saue them from hurte, he is bound to deny the same with some kynd of lawfull Equiuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but without telling a lye, as<note n="*" place="margin">Supra cap. 7. 8. 9. 10.</note> before at large hath byn declared. But if this priest should be taken in the port, as he entreth, or soone after in the high way or otherwise, and brought before a Magistrate, so as his confessing himselfe to be a priest could not preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice any other, and presupposing that he is vnlawfully demaunded that question, against law, reason, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, heere is he at his owne liberty to deny or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse himselfe to be a priest, and no man can absolutly determine, what were best for him to answere, but the spirite of God that speaketh within him, to whome Christ hath promised to imparte such wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,<note place="margin">Luc. <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> as is necessarie for that tyme and action: yet if he were not a man of such great extraordinary tale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, as by his losse or restraint, Gods cause were to leese much, or that he were not sure by his denyall to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure his liberty, or that he might iustly doubt that he should quickly come to be knowne in prison, and therby some scandall to arise to the simple, or yll af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by his denyal; In al these Cases I would thinke it more meritorious and of greater perfection and edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication<note place="margin">Diuers conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> to confesse himselfe a priest without further denyall, or declination, which I speake not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne them, or their doinges that being taken haue done, or shall do the contrary, for that they vse but their owne right, as hath byn declared: but rather I
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:14593:291"/>
speake it for information of others that may doubt of the Case. Nor do we intend heere to preiudice the most holy doctrine of <hi>S. Athanasius,</hi> and other ancient<note place="margin">Lib. de fuga sua.</note> Fathers of the lawfulnes of flight and escape in perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, councelled by Christ our Sauiour, and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized<note place="margin">Math. 10.</note> by the example of the Apostles themselues, and<note place="margin">Act. 9.</note> namely of <hi>S.

            <p n="5">5. And this is so much as in this matter I had to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertise Catholickes in the Conclusion of this my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, not meaning to discend into further perticu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of actions &amp; obligations that may fall out, which heere are hard to be determined; but only by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent circumstances of the tyme, place, and matter in hand, with regard and respect vnto the two principall vertues that must gouerne vs in these af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ayres, to witt, <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>Iustice.

            <p n="6">6.

For that all men know now, or at least wise his Reader will by this our Answere, that the doctrine of <hi>Equiuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> in certayne Cases, and with due circumstances, is not <hi>Alchimy of the Iesuites,</hi> but the ignorance of <hi>Morton,</hi> and his fellowes, who ascribe that vnto them, as the chife Authors, which was in vse many hundred years before they were in the world. And as for the <hi>Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polie of artes,</hi> if he vnderstand therby, their teaching aboue others of liberall Artes, and sciences in their schooles throughout Christendome, it is true in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne sorte, that this kynd of <hi>Monopolie,</hi> or preeminent labour may be granted vnto their endeauours of their Godly instruction &amp; institution of youth. And happy had it beene for <hi>Tho. Morton,</hi> if he had beene brought vp vnder that <hi>Monopoly,</hi> for it is like he would haue
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:14593:292"/>
had, if not more grace, yet more witt at least and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, then to haue obiected vnto them, as heere he doth, <hi>that no art is singuler in them but that of Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation,</hi> wheras the doctrine of <hi>Equiuocation,</hi> as Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickes hold it, and we before expounded it, is no art, but a sound position in Deuinity, belonging to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of a good Conscience, against lying, wherof <hi>Morton</hi> and his fellowes haue so learned the art, and<note place="margin">The faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of lying in T.
