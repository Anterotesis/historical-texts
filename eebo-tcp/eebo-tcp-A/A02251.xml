            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <lg>
               <l>A Noble Marques as he did ride on hunting</l>
               <l>hard by a Forrest side:</l>
               <l>A proper Mayden as she did fit a spinning</l>
               <l>his gentle eye espide.</l>
               <l>Most faire &amp; louely, and of curteous grace was she,</l>
               <l>although in simple attire:</l>
               <l>She sung full sweet with pleasant voyce melodiously,</l>
               <l>which set the Lords hart on fire.</l>
               <l>The more he looked the more he might,</l>
               <l>Beautie bred his hartes delight.</l>
               <l>and to this dainty Damsell then he went:</l>
               <l>God speede quoth he, thou famous flower,</l>
               <l>Faire mistres of this homely bower,</l>
               <l>where loue &amp; vertue liues with sweete content.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>With comely iesture &amp; curteous milde behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</l>
               <l>she bad him welcome then:</l>
               <l>She entertaind him in faithful friendly maner</l>
               <l>and all his Gentlemen.</l>
               <l>the noble marques in his hart felt such a flame</l>
               <l>which set his sences at strife:</l>
               <l>Quoth he, faire maiden shew me soone what is thy name?</l>
               <l>I meane to make thee my wife.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Grissell</hi> is my name quoth she,</l>
               <l>Farre vnfit for your degree,</l>
               <l>a silly Mayden and of parents poore.</l>
               <l>Nay <hi>Grissell</hi> thou art rich he sayd,</l>
               <l>A vertuous faire and comely Mayd,</l>
               <l>graunt me thy loue, and I wil aske no more.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>At length she consented, &amp; being both contented</l>
               <l>they married were with speed:</l>
               <l>Her contrey russet was changd to silk &amp; veluet</l>
               <l>as to her state agreed.</l>
               <l>And when she was trimly tyred in the same,</l>
               <l>her beauty shined most bright,</l>
               <l>Far staining euery other braue &amp; comly dame,</l>
               <l>that did appeare in her sight.</l>
               <l>Many enuied her therefore,</l>
               <l>Because she was of parents poore,</l>
               <l>and twixe her Lord &amp; the great strife did raise</l>
               <l>Some sayd this, and some sayd that,</l>
               <l>Some did call her beggers brat,</l>

               <l>O noble Marques (quoth they) why doe you wrong vs</l>
               <l>thus bacely for to wed?</l>
               <l>That might haue gotten an honorable Lady,</l>
               <l>into your Princely bed.</l>
               <l>Who will not now your noble issue still deride</l>

               <l>That are of blood so base by their mothers side</l>
               <l>the which will bring them in scorne:</l>
               <l>Put her therefore quite away,</l>
               <l>Take to you a Lady gay,</l>
               <l>whereby your linage may renowned be:</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>When that the marques did see that they were bent thus</l>
               <l>against his faithfull wife,</l>
               <l>Whom he most deerely, tenderly, and entirely,</l>
               <l>beloued as his life.</l>
               <l>Minding in secret for to proue her patient hart</l>
               <l>therby her foes to disgrace:</l>
               <l>Thinking to play a hard vncurteous part,</l>

               <l>Great with childe this Lady was,</l>
