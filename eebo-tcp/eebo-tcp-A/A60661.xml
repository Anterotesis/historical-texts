            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE TRUE LIGHT Shining in ENGLAND, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>OH <hi>ENGLAND, ENGLAND!</hi> Thou hast been oft faithfully Warned, but thou hast not regarded, thou hast been careless of thy own happiness, and hast not respected those that have sought thy good; thou hast been a stubborn and a rebellious Nation, and hast set at nought many tender Visitations of Gods love unto thee, which by the mouths of his faithful Servants have been declared; thou hast been a proud scornful, and disdainful Nation, stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, hating every Tender of Love that hath been proffered to thee, and hast exalted they self in the strength of thy own might, against the Lord, and against his faithful Servants, whom he hath sent forth in his Love to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his Goodness unto thee; and who have run, and yet do run in the strength of his Power, early and late to do thee good; but thou hast evilly entreated them, and rendred Cruelty unto them, and raised bitter Persecution against them for their travail within thee, and for their good-will unto thee; this Recompence hast thou given them, whose lives are not dear unto them for thy sake, <hi>Holes</hi> and <hi>Prisons, Stocks</hi> and <hi>Whips</hi> have been their Reward from thee, for thou wouldest not obey the voyce of the Lords Servants, nor hearken to the Lords Counsel, that thou mightest have humbled thy self before him; but thou despised the day of Mercy, and lightly esteemed the Visitations of the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52017:3"/>
Almighty: Oh! how hast thou provoked him dayly, and caused his jealousie to burn like fire; and yet for his Names sake, he spares thee, and doth not bring utter Desolation upon thee; such is his goodness towards thee, wouldst thou open thine eyes to see it, he hath no pleasure to destroy thee and lay thee wast, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath he exercised a day of Patience towards thee, and many faithful Warnings have been sounded within thee from the Lords Power; how hath he striven with <hi>Thee,</hi> thy <hi>Rulers</hi> and <hi>Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> in these late years, that you might have observed his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and thereby have come to Repentance; but thou hast been a perfidious Nation, turning every way to promote thy own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trest; and this hath been the great work of thy Rulers and Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers in late time: Therefore is the Lord just concerning thee, with all thy <hi>Rulers</hi> and <hi>Teachers,</hi> that had their day and time in thee, and the Lords tender Mercy is not yet shut up from thee, though he hath been rejected by thee, but Visitations of Love he still reaches forth unto <hi>Thee,</hi> thy <hi>Rulers</hi> and <hi>Teachers,</hi> that now have their day within thee, if any will turn unto him, if any will hear his voyce, and do the thing that is right in his sight, that he may not utterly cut off and destroy at once.</p>
            <p>Therefore <hi>hear O England,</hi> and let all thy <hi>Rulers</hi> and <hi>Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers</hi> that now stand within thee, <hi>incline to the Lords Counsel;</hi> for it is but a little while, and the wicked shall be no more; then happy will they be that Rules for God, and happy will they be that Teach Truth that God may be glorified, for he is risen the works of men to try, and all that seek his right he will cut off, for that he will not give to any: Therefore let all beware what they seek, and what they take upon them, that they enter not upon his right, which he will not give to any man, for he is glorifying his own Name, and exalting his own Son, and spreading abroad his Living Truth; and this he will have to Reign as his own Right, and let none strive to take it from him, for he is a jealous God.</p>
            <p>Oh <hi>ENGLAND!</hi> thy way is much in darkness, and thou travellest through the thickest Clouds, and with them thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passest thy self about, and therein sittest secure, as if thou shouldest never see sorrow more. Is the sound of the Trumpet and Alarm of War so soon passed away from before thee? Is all the Blood
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52017:3"/>
that hath been spilt in thy Fields and Towns so soon gone out of thy remembrance? Hast thou so soon forgotten the years of thy Calamity that so lately hath been upon thee? If these things be passed out of thy mind, and thou run out of the sense of them, as if they had never been, yet let the Treasure, that thou so dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lovest, which was spent within thee to uphold such Cruchy, cause thee to remember the years of thy Misery, in which thou wast deeply distressed, that thou mayest repent of all thy wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and uncleanness, and abominations, that thou dost not draw down an heavier judgment upon thee than yet thy eyes hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held. What hath been brought forth by men through all these years of thy Calamity and Distress, into which thou hast been plunged? Have any been faithfull unto God, or performed their <hi>Vows</hi> unto the Most High? Surely they all corrupted their way, and none set their heart to do the thing that is right; nor any that had respect to the Poor and Needy, but laid Burdens upon them, and sorely oppressed them, and their Cry went unto the Lord, and he heard them, and in his strength he rose to help them, and hath undertaken the Cause for them, and will plead it throughly with all men upon the Earth; for he hath great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect unto a poor and an innocent People, whom he hath raised within thee by his Eternal Power, which all <hi>thy Rulers</hi> and <hi>Teachers</hi> set themselves against, and took counsel together how they might suppress them and root them out: But the Lord doth uphold them, and by the Arm of his Power hath preserved them, and they are standing, when those that did afflict them, and sought to harm them, are cut down and fallen; and this is a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous thing, which the Lord hath brought to passe by an Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Power, who hath laid all waste before him, and hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spered his Work, and carried it on by his out-stretched Arm; and as man at any time hath devised Crueky, then hath he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in his Mercy, that the more that Affliction hath been laid upon his Innocent People, the more have they multiplied; and this is the Lords doings, who pleads with all flesh.</p>
            <p>Oh <hi>England!</hi> much Enmity remains <hi>within thee,</hi> against an Innocent people that seeks <hi>thy good;</hi> who travels to turn thee <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Light</hi> that shineth <hi>in thee,</hi> that thou mightest not abide <hi>in darkness</hi> and <hi>perish,</hi> but mightest come <hi>to the Light of life;</hi> And
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52017:4"/>
this is the Lords good-will unto thee, who hath raised an Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent people whose love is to thee, when thou art most filled with enmity against them. How long hast thou had it in thy heart to execute Cruelty, and yet thou hast not had power to do it unto the full! but by an Invisible hand hast been restrained from swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing up, when thy mouth hath been opened wide, and thy heart thirsty to devour. There was a time when thou wast let loose, and wast <hi>as a Bear bereaved of her whelps,</hi> and <hi>as a Lion sit for his prey;</hi> yet in the height of thy fury thou wast chained, and thy bounds was set, and the chain was too strong for thee, and the bounds thou couldest not drive away before thy fury; thou stretchedst thy self to the length of thy chain, and came up in thy strength to the utmost bounds, and there roared and swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and foamed out thy shame, and cast up much of thy mire and dirt; but thou wast there stopped, and thy proud and turbulent waves were limited, and the innocent Lambs were preserved out of thy devouring mouth; and thou couldest not destroy them, though thou soughtest it with all thy strength; and when thou couldest not execute the mischief of thy heart unto the full, there was a hope in thee, that power should be given thee in time to come; but the Lord forsakes not his Chosen, neither gives he them wholly up for a prey into thy teeth, though some do suffer by thee, which at that time were given into thy hands to try thee, and thou cast them into prisons in thy rage and fury, when they were in the Lords service, and labouring to do thee good, and had done nothing worthy of bonds, neither hast thou any such charge against them, but in thy wrath and madness thou ran rashly upon them, when they neither disturbed thy Peace, nor transgressed thy Law; and this was to try thee that thou mightest make thy self manifest; and the witness against thee, <hi>is the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons within thee,</hi> into which thou hast cast the Lords faithfull Servants, for whose sakes he will plead with thee; and though thou hast shut them up, and shews no pity towards them, but lets them lye, though they have done nothing worthy of it, and keeps them <hi>in thy malice</hi> and <hi>envy,</hi> some <hi>in one place,</hi> and some <hi>in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> as <hi>Lawcaster, Lambeth-house, Nantwich,</hi> and <hi>divers other places within thee,</hi> where the Lords faithful Servants suffer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thy Cruelty, and are afflicted by thee, whose innocent cause
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52017:4"/>
the Lord will certainly avenge upon thee, except thou speedily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent; for there are many strong cries unto the Lord this day, and prayer and supplication is made unto him in the strength of his own Spirit, which his ear is open to hear, and he will not forget the Righteous, neither will he forsake them, but will plead with all that seek to spoil them, and will recompence unto them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the fruit of their doings.</p>
            <p>Oh <hi>England!</hi> thou art traced thorow, and thy doings are all found out with the Light of Christ that shines in thee; which thy darkness cannot comprehend, and all <hi>thy wayes</hi> are manifest therein, and thou art found to be exceeding wicked in thy heart, and exceeding vain in thy imaginations: Thou settest not the Lord before thee, therfore his displeasure is against thee, &amp; except thou speedily repent and obey his Counsel, thou canst not escape the severity of his judgment; for a fire is kindled in his breast, which shall burn to the nethermost hell, and it will reach thee when thou goest down thither for counsel, and will be as hot burning coals in the midst of thy bowels, and there will be none to quench it; for God will not spare thee in thy wickedness and abominations which yet remain in thee, but will cut down and consume, untill he hath cleansed the Land of <hi>Cruelty</hi> and <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now the <hi>Revolution</hi> is gone about, and that which was out of sight is come up, and that which was above is gone down and over-shadowed; so vain a thing is man before his Maker; and this is not come to passe for the righteousness of any man, or that any man should exalt himself in it, but for his own Names sake, who Reigns over all.</p>
            <p>Oh <hi>England!</hi> let all such as are now risen in thee to Rule, be carefull and mind well their doings; <hi>for the same God Ruleth still,</hi> and his Power changeth not, but brings to passe all changeable things in their time and place: and if man now strive again to set up the same things which once provoked the Lord to anger, and which his Controversie was against, and still continue the Burdens by strengthning the Oppressors, which hath from time to time drawn down Judgment upon the heads of those that had Power to remove it, but did not, and brought the Lords stroak upon them, and none could be found that were able to uphold
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52017:5"/>
them, though many sought it with all their strength. Let not vain man imagine that the Righteous God will either <hi>favour</hi> or <hi>allow these things to be set up or continued in this day,</hi> against which <hi>he hath appeared,</hi> and by his Eternal Power <hi>overwhelmed;</hi> but certainly his Controversie is still against <hi>the same things,</hi> and all <hi>that strengthens them,</hi> or endeavours to <hi>promote them;</hi> and though neither <hi>Sword</hi> nor <hi>Spear</hi> may be used, yet will the Lord carry it on by his own power, that works according to his own pleasure; for his way is not as the way of man, who sometimes destroyes and builds the same things again with his changeable mind; But the way of the Most High is more equal, and he will not allow the setting up of those things again, which once grieved his Holy Spirit, and provoked him to Anger, which drew forth his Arm against them, by which they were cut down; neither is this come to passe <hi>in ENGLAND</hi> that it should be so done, but that all should <hi>FEAR</hi> before <hi>the God of Jacob,</hi> and <hi>BOW before the Holy One of Israel,</hi> and mind his Goodness, and come to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and be humbled in the dust for Iniquities committed, that he may spread forth his Power, and Reign in his Right, and Order all things that concerns his Service and Worship, and that none go about to keep him out of that, and take it upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but let him be <hi>HEAD</hi> and <hi>KING, JUDGE</hi> and <hi>LAW<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GIVER,</hi> and <hi>Supream Governour over his Church,</hi> for that is his Right and his Glory who is the Prince of Peace, and who seeks to take it from him, must fall before him, for he will not give it to any man, and herein hath <hi>his Controversie</hi> appeared with all Sorts and Sects of People whom he hath tryed in their day, who would never submit to his Government, nor yield un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him his Right, but took it to themselves, and robbed him of his Glory; for which <hi>Cause</hi> the Lord hath turned <hi>their Glory</hi> into <hi>shame,</hi> and their <hi>day</hi> into <hi>darkness,</hi> and they are gone down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and others are come upwards, and are new placed in Power to Rule over their Heads, because the Warnings of the Lord had no place in them, but were rejected by them; and the things that they should have done, they did them not.</p>

This may be a <hi>Warning</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, <hi>O England,</hi> for ever placing thy Faith in man's Wisdom any more; for thou hast been long a deceived Nation, and the Lord hath largely opened his love to thee, that thou mightst have been undeceived, and not to have placed thy confidence so much in man, but that thou mightest have turned unto the power of God, and placed thy confidence in it, but thou hast kickt as a wild Heifer that would not come to the yoke, and didst not regard <hi>the faithful MESSAGES</hi> that in thee hath been sounded forth.</p>

word or deed, the Light reproves him in his own Conscience, and finites him in judgment for Transgression; the Light speaks near unto every man, and calls the workers of Iniquity to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and to abstain from evil; it doth not consent to any evil thing which in mans heart arises, but secretly reproves it; if any intent arise that is not brought forth, it searcheth it out and makes it manifest, and brings it to a discovery that it may be seen of what sort it is; it brings man into a sensibleness of his present state, the Light shews him whether hh be a Drunkard, a Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, a Lyer, an Envious man, or what ever it be that arises from the Darkness, it is made manifest by the Light; if any thing lodge never so secretly it finds it out; if there be an intent to Steal, or to Defraud, or to Lie, or Anger, or Envy, or Pride, or Evil-will lodge in the heart of man, and none can accuse him for any of them, yet the Light finds out such things, and judges man, and reproves him in his own Conscience for them; the Light hath no Communion with Darkness, nor fellowship with Unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, but stands in man, a witness against man that unto any evil thing is joyned.</p>

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52017:8"/>
is good in the Leadings of the Light, and so man comes out of Anger and Envy, into Meekness and Love, and is led from all the Works of the Flesh that be evil, unto God who is the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est good; and this is the work of Christ, the Power of God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Salvation; he comes into the World, and reproves the World, he leaves the World again, and saves out of it all that obey and follow him; So he makes manifest all things that be evil, and he leads out of them, and saves from them as obedience is given to him: So a Drunkard turning to the Light, when it reproves him for Drunkenness, and yielding obedience to it, it leads him out of Drunkenness into Soberness, and delivers him from under the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of Satan, who hath him Captive at his will; and so the Light makes all things manifest, and as it is obeyed it leads out of all Evil, both in thought, word and deed; and places true judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon all Evil things, and brings them all to the death of the Cross, and slayes the Enmity, and makes all subject to its power, cutting down the Man of Sin, and Crucifying the Flesh, with all the Affections and Lusts of it; and so the old Man dies with all his corruptible deeds, and in the Judgment is buried down, and the new Man is raised, which after God is created in Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; and so a holy Birth is born through the Operation of the Power of the Light, in which the spirit of the mind is renewed, and Soul and Body sanctified, and the Conscience purged from all dead works; and thus all <hi>old things</hi> is put off, and all things are <hi>made new,</hi> in the work of Regeneration, in which a new birth is raised, that abides in the Fathers House, and feeds upon bread of Life.</p>

on its behalf that it should keep: And we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not own this practice, knowing that the living God is without beginning of dayes, or end of time, and hath neither <hi>Father</hi> or <hi>Mother;</hi> and they blaspheme the Lord and his Name, who give such names unto the Creature; And there is none <hi>that can forsake the Devil and all his Works,</hi> but as they come <hi>to the Light of Christ manifest in them,</hi> that doth discover what the Devils Works are, and gives power over them, and leads out of them all that in it do believe.</p>
               <p>We cannot own <hi>Made PRAYERS,</hi> and Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them over in a Book, or any other formal way; we cannot joyn with that practice, or those that pray after that manner; because it stands amongst the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, and is not performed in the Spirit of Truth, that only hath access to God and makes Request according to his Will.</p>
               <p>We cannot <hi>RESPECT PERSONS,</hi> of what quality soever they may be reputed; because they <hi>that respect persons, commit sin.</hi> We cannot put off our Hats, as in honour to the Person of any man, or give him any flattering Titles: for our Subjection is to the <hi>Power of GOD;</hi> and all Men in that we honour, not with putting off the Hat, and bowing the Knee, which is the honour below; but in Uprightness of our hearts before the Lord we truly honour all Men in his Power.</p>
               <p>We cannot speak any other language but THOU to any single person, which is the language of Truth unto him, and according to the Scriptures of Truth; and that which cannot receive it, is proud flesh, which we cannot satisfie, but speak Truth to every man,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52017:12"/>
without any respect to his person.</p>
               <p>We cannot own <hi>the WORLDS CUSTOMS</hi> which they run into, and answer one another in, when they meet one with another, or passing by one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, saying, <hi>Good Morrow,</hi> or <hi>Good Even,</hi> or <hi>Good Day</hi> or <hi>Good Night;</hi> and this they have got in the Custom, not understanding what they speak; but if the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom of it be but observed, and the words be spoken, they are pleased and satisfied, when they know not that which made <hi>the Evening</hi> and <hi>the Morning good;</hi> So unto them neither <hi>Morning</hi> nor <hi>Evening,</hi> nor <hi>Day</hi> nor <hi>Night</hi> is good, not dwelling in God's Power that made all things good. So it is but words in Custom which fallen man, that abides in the Evil, uses one to another; which Custom we cannot own, neither dare we observe to do it unto any People upon the Earth. And this is the great cause why we bear so many Reproaches from Ignorant People, who are in darkness, and know nothing beyond their Customs; because we dare not speak but in the Wisdom of God, which gives us words to speak in due season.</p>
               <p>These things here mentioned, with much more that is observed in the Customs and Worship of the World <hi>We cannot own,</hi> nor <hi>joyn withall,</hi> for no other cause <hi>but only for Conscience sake,</hi> being convinced of the Evil of them; and being redeemed by the Power of God from amongst them, we cannot return again to observe them, or to come under the power of them: for, we have weighed them, and finde them to be out of the Truth, and contrary to the Scriptures of Truth; and who will search the Scriptures, and wait
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52017:12"/>
in the Light to understand them, may certainly know that our Testimony agrees with them, and what we are led to witness for, or testifie against, we finde the Answer of a good Conscience in it, and Peace with God, which is our Joy and Crown of Rejoycing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And if any sober People desire any further satisfaction concerning us, we are ready in the Power of God, to give a Reason unto any that asks us a Question of the Hope that is in us in meekness and fear.</hi>
