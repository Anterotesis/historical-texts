            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>IF thou hast perused my Observations up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the two Magicall Treatises of <hi>Eugenius Philalethes,</hi> and his Answer to them, I do not doubt but that seeming and personated sharpnesse of mine will now seem just no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all, to thy indifferent judgement; if thou compare it with his unchristian bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and inhumane railings against me. For mine own part, I was so farre from all malice, that if I have trespassed, it was from that over-pleasantnesse of temper I was in, when I wrote: which made me perhaps too heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse how much I might displease the party with whom I dealt, being secure of the truth of that saying in the Poet,</p>
                  <q>— Ridentem dicere verum Quis vetat? —</q>
                  <p>But I find that I have so nettled him una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares, as if his senses lay all in his backside,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:99981:6"/>
and had left his brains destitute. Which hath made him very ill-favouredly wrong both himself, the Rod, and the Correctour. Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily if I had thought his retentive faculty had been so weak, I would not have fouled my fingers with medling with him. Nor would I now lay on this second gentle lash (I seeing the disposition of my young <hi>Eugenius</hi>) if it were not as well to wipe my self, as to whip him. I could have been content to have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented to the world as ignorant of Nature and Philosophy, as he hath by his bold and very bad speeches to me, endeavoured to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present me. For I am not bound in consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to know Nature, but my self; nor to be a deep Philosopher, but to be and approve my self a plain and honest Christian. This forced me to this Reply. But I thought fit to cast in also, what will prove me no lesse a Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, then no Rayler.</p>
                  <p>But I am not contented to justifie my self onely from the successe; but to thy further satisfaction, I shall not think much to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint thee with my purposes and principles. The truth is, <hi>Eugenius,</hi> though he be so high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:99981:7"/>
conceited of himself, that he thinks his worth is great enough to contract my envy; yet he is so little in my eyes, and my self (I thank God) so little envious, that in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard he is not at all considerable to me. But my drift was to whip that <hi>Genius</hi> and dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation he is for the present under, upon <hi>Euge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> his own back, as having deserved to be an instrument to so good an end. And I perswade my self there are those parts and that freedome in some measure already in this young Philosopher, that in a little time he will say that he deserved this correction, &amp; will laugh for companie at the merry punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and will freely confesse that I am his brother <hi>Philalethes,</hi> a lover of him and of Truth: And that he that whipped the money changers out of the Temple, is as much the first <hi>Mastix,</hi> as <hi>Adam</hi> the first <hi>Magicus.</hi> But for the present he is under that dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which is as pernicious to the nature of man and Christianity it self, as it is, to the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and wife, ridiculous. For he is even in a feaverish thirst after knowledge and fame, &amp; (as he hath made it manifest to the world)
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:99981:7"/>
more after fame by farre then knowledge. Wherefore, I observing in his Theomagicall tumour and loftinesse nothing but confident misapplying or conceitedly interpreting the holy Writ, the drift and meaning whereof is farre above all naturall Philosophy or tricks of Magick whatsoever: and then a sleight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and scorning those that, I dare say, he doth not understand, who yet are very rationall and intelligible, I mean such as <hi>Des Cartes:</hi> and down right rayling against the <hi>Aristote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans</hi> and <hi>Galenists,</hi> who yet have many sober and usefull truths amongst them: Moreover, I noting a melancholick, flatuous and heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse phansie to appear in his writings, clothed with sonorous and amazing terms, such as might rather astonish the ignorant, then teach the docible: Add unto al this, that it is too too common a disease now adayes to be driven by heedlesse intoxicating imaginations under pretense of higher strains of Religion and supernaturall light, and by bidding adieu to sober reason and a purified mind, to grow first fanaticall; and then Atheisticall and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall, even almost to the height of abhorred
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:99981:8"/>
                     <hi>Gnosticisme:</hi> I thought in good earnest it was very fit, out of my indignation to Foolery and Imposture, out of my detestation to Beastlinesse, Atheisme, and Sensuality, and lastly, out of that honourable respect and tender affection I bear to the Plainesse and Simplicity of the life of Christ and true di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wisdome, to take occasion to write in such a manner as I did, and to discountenance that <hi>Genius,</hi> that defaces the new appearing face of Christendome, and is a reproach to that just liberty that belongs to all those that seek after God in sincerity and truth.</p>
                  <p>I but you will say, This indeed may be well meant: But what title or right have you to intermeddle, or to correct another mans follies? This is usurpation and incivility. To this may many things be answered. It is true; The inward rottenness of men hath made ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry smooth laws to themselves in favour of their own follies and vices, and mutuall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivence at what is bad is held the best man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; as if mankind pack'd and conspired to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to keep wickedness warm in her usurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed seat by never taking the boldnesse to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:99981:8"/>
her title. But to judge more charitably of the generations of men, I think it is more out of self-love, then love to her, and out of a tender dotage toward this imposturous knot of Atoms, our earthly Personality. Which yet I thought I was more favourable to here, having to do onely with fictitious names not any known Person. But it doth not follow, Though this be the mode, that therefore it is the right fashion: and <hi>Quando ego non curo tuum, ne cura meum,</hi> is but surlely said of the old man in the Comedy. That's the principle of <hi>Cain, Am I my brothers keeper?</hi> There was more divine generosity in that noted <hi>Cynick,</hi> then in civility it self, when it is so soft, that it will not prick nor hurt vice. He would not spare to speak where things went amisse, however he sped for it; <hi>tanquam Pater omnium, tanquam Frater omnium,</hi> as they report of him. And I think I have sped ill enough for my but seasonable speaking.</p>
                  <p>But if this be to appeal to too high a law, I answer further, that <hi>Eugenius</hi> had forfeited his priviledges he might claim by the laws of civility, he himself having so uncivilly dealt
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:99981:9"/>
with others, that are above all comparison better then he. I but you'll say, Why do you make him so ridiculous in your reproving him? Single reproof had been enough. I answer, I did not make him ridiculous, but found him so. He put on himself the pyde coat, and I onely drew aside the curtain. Did not the <hi>Thracian</hi> Girl rightly laugh at <hi>Thales</hi> when she see him stumble into a ditch, whiles he was staring up at the starres? And are not they as ridiculous, that pretend to Seraphick mysterious Theories, and are not masters yet of common sense, and plainest truths of Christianity? That stumble at the threshold, or rather grope for the dore as the blinded <hi>Sodomites?</hi> All the faculties of man are good in themselves, and the use of them, is at least permitted to him, provided that with sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable circumstances and upon a right ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. And I have made it already manifest that my Act was bounded with these cautions</p>
                  <p>I but there is yet something behind unsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied. Though <hi>Eugenius</hi> be ridiculous; yet is it not ridiculous, for one that pretends so much to the love of Christianitie as your self,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:99981:9"/>
so publickly to laugh at him? That pinches indeed. Why! am I so venerable a Person<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age? I am sure I never affected to seem any such to the world yet. I wear no sattin ears, nor silk cap with as many seams as there are streaks in the back of a lute. I affect neither long prayers nor a long beard, nor walk with a smooth-knobbed staff to sustein my Gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. If I be a Precisian, as <hi>Eugenius</hi> would have me, it must be from hence that I precise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly keep my self to the naked truth of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity. As for Sects, Ceremonies, super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious Humours, or specious garbs of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctimony, I look on them all, if affected, as the effects of Ignorance, or masks of Hypocrisie. And thus am I <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, a Gentleman in <hi>querpo,</hi> a meer man, a true man, a Christian. One that never thinks himself so great, as to grow unweildy &amp; unready to put himself into any shape or posture for a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon good. And I prethee, Reader, why may not such a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian as this laugh? Or tell me, Who is he in Heaven that laughs them to scorn, that has the opposers of the reigne of Christ in derisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? God is not a man that he should laugh,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:99981:10"/>
no more then cry or repent, as much as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the Divine Essence it self: But as God is in a <hi>Deiform</hi> man he may be said to laugh, and he can be said to laugh no where else. And if he might, yet that which is attributed to God, though <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, cannot mis-become a good man. Thus, Reader, is your argument against laughing as solidly argued as sportingly laughed out of counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; and affected austerity made ridiculous by the plain and unaffected reasonings of <hi>Eugenius</hi> his merry Adversary, but</p>

                  <p>THe reason why you heard not from me sooner, is because yours arrived to my hands later then I exspected. It was so hot it seems, that none of my acquaintance had so hard and brawny fingers as to indure the dandling of this glowing coal till its conveyance where you would have it. It is a brand from that fire, that hath not onely calcined, but so vitrified <hi>Eugenius,</hi> that it hath made him transparent to all the world. All men may see now through his glassy sides how unevenly and disorderly his black heart beats &amp; pants; they need not feel his pulse to find his distemper. <hi>AEsops</hi> fair water but a little warmed hath proved a very effectuall <hi>Emetick</hi> for thee, O <hi>Philalethes,</hi> and hath made thee vomit up thy shame and folly in the sight of the world, as his Accuser did the figs before his Master. So that that which you falsely supposed me to have
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:99981:11"/>
endeavoured, you have fatally brought upon your self, above the desire, I should think, of your bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest enemies, I am sure beyond the exspectation of me that am your reall friend. I did not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour your personall disgrace, but the discoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancing of that, which in my judgement is the disgrace of your person, and many other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons besides. And now that you have done me the greatest despight you can imagine, and show'd your malice to the full, so that in the court of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and according to the doctrine of Christ you are no better then a murderer, yet for all this I am benignly affected to you still, and wish you as much good, as I do those, that never endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to provoke me. And really I speak it from my soul, if it lay in my power to do it, you should find it. But for the present, I could in my judgement do nothing more proper, considering all circumstances, then what I have done, and still do, in advertising you of what is for the best. And truly, (looking upon you in some sort as a <hi>Noctambulo,</hi> one that walks in his sleep) that book which hath proved so mischeivous a scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal, I intended onely for a stumble to wake you, (that you might shrugg and rub your eyes, and

You one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mutter against the present disturbance, as one shogged while he dreams upon his pillow, but you still sleep. You cry out as one cramp'd in your bed, but your closed sight can not discern whether it be a friend in sport or for better purpose, or whether it be your foe to torture you. Awake <hi>Eugenius!</hi> Awake, Behold, it is I, your sportfully troublesome friend, or what you will in due time acknowledge, though in this present drousie humour you puff at it, and kick against it,</p>

                  <p>ANd now, <hi>Eugenius,</hi> if it be as law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for me to speak to one asleep, as it was for <hi>Diogenes</hi> to talk to Pillars and Posts that are not in a capacity of ever being awake: Let me tell you (to begin with your Title-page first) that you do very much undervalue and wrong your self, that you being a gentleman of that learning and parts that you are, you will thus poorly condescend to that contemptible trade of a Mous-catcher: And that you are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to abuse your self onely, but you do ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use Scripture too, by your ridiculous apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Pauls</hi> fighting with beasts at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> to your combating with, and overcoming of a mouse. Truly, <hi>Philalethes,</hi> I think, they that have the meanest opinion of you, would give you their suffrage for a taller office then
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:99981:13"/>
this, and adjudge you at least worthy of the place of a Rat-catcher.</p>
                  <p>As for your Epistle Dedicatory, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you have a very indulgent Tutour, else you would not be so bold to utter so foul lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage in his hearing. You have a very fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar friend of him, if you can without breach of civilitie thus freely vomit up your figs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his bosome,</p>
                  <p>But for <hi>P. B.</hi> of <hi>Oxenford</hi> his verses, I will onely set this one verse of <hi>Virgil's</hi> against them all;</p>
                  <q>Qui Bavium non odit, amet tua carmina, Maevi.</q>
                  <p>Thus you see how gladly I would rid my self of all your foul language and fooleries. I have nimbly run through these, I shall leap over the rest as so many dirty ditches. Your slovingly speeches and uncivil raylings, you must seek an answer for them in <hi>Billinsgate,</hi> or amongst the Butchers;</p>

                  <p>But where you bring any thing that bears any shew of reason with it, I will (though it be farre below me to answer so foul a mouth)
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:99981:13"/>
return what in the judgement of the sober, I hope will not fail to be approved as satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie.</p>

                     <p>In these pages you accuse me of very high incivility and immoralitie. And it is an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation worth the answering, especially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing set off with that great aggravation of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing committed against one that is a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. But verily, <hi>Philalethes,</hi> I do not meet with any man now that takes you to be such, after this <hi>specimen,</hi> as I call it, of your <hi>Kainish</hi> and unchristian dealing with me, whom in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different judges will not think to have deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the hundredth part of this revenge. I tell thee, <hi>Eugenius,</hi> there is no Christian but who is partaker of the holy unction, <gap reason="foreign">

                        <hi>of the divine Nature,</hi> and of that pure and peaceable love. But if thou thinkest thy mere Baptisme will make thee a Christian (while in the mean time thy heart is possessed of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness and hatred, which the law of Christ interprets murder) the heathen Poet is able to shew thee thy grosse errour in this point;</p>
                     <pb n="24" facs="tcp:99981:14"/>

                        <l>Oh fools and credulous! that think you may</l>
                        <l>By water wash sad guilt of bloud away.</l>
                     </lg>
                     <p>But to the accusation and charge it self: which is this; That I say you are <hi>Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus-like, a Heated noddle, a Mome, a Mimick, an Ape, a mere Animal, a Snail, a Philosophik hog, a Nip-crust, a Pick-pocket, a Niggard, Tom fool with a devils head and horns, one that desires to be a Conjurer more then a Christian.</hi> This is the first part of your charge. But before I answer to the particulars of it, or proceed to the other, these two things are to be noted; First, that you have drained all the sharper humour that was but thinly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spersed through the body of my book into two narrow places, that you may make them appear like two angry boyls, or malignant pushes in the bodie; which if it were done in the soundest body that is, there would be the like seeming distemper. Secondly, it is to be considered that I did professe that I would put my self in some seeming posture of harsh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and incivilitie, that I might shew you
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:99981:14"/>
your own reall miscarriage to others, by imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating and personating the same toward your self. But the thing that I contend for now, is, that this personated incivility and harshnes of mine is nothing so harsh and uncivill as you do here make it, as will appear from the causes or occasionall circumstances of this hard language you have thus culled out. For to begin with the first: You having a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe to seem no smal thing in the world, and also pretending to Magick; how easily, how naturally do's it fall into the mind of a man, to compare you to <hi>Simon Magus</hi> in these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards? And if you did not walk as all touchy proud men do, as it were with their skins flean off, such a light thing as this would not smart nor hurt you so sore.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Heated noddle.</hi> That's the onely mischief of it that it is true, and your flame and smoke is as conspicuous as that of <hi>Aetna</hi> and <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suvius:</hi>
                     </p>
                     <q>— Quis enim celaverit ignem? Enitet indicio prodita flamma suo.</q>

                        <l>For who can fire conceal? whose flame shoots out</l>
                        <l>And shining shews it self to all about.</l>

                     <p>As your heat and fire has sufficiently done, especially in this your last against me, to your great credit: I am sure to mine, for you have writ so as if you intended to save me from all suspicion of being mistaken in you.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Mome,</hi> a <hi>Mimick,</hi> and an <hi>Ape.</hi> I onely said that you were more like those then <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle:</hi> And if you distrust my judgement, I pray you ask any body else.</p>
                     <p>And to call you a <hi>mere Animal</hi> occasional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in our dispute, <hi>Whether the world be an Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal or no:</hi> what rudenesse is there in it: worse then this is held no incivilitie betwixt those two famous Philosophers <hi>Cardan</hi> and <hi>Scaliger,</hi> whom your Magisterialnesse has made bold to use at least as coursely, as I seem to have used you. But you would it seems have the whole Monopoly of reprehension to your self. And much good may it do you <hi>Engenius.</hi> My generous liberty of speech has been so well entertained by some in the world, that I shall take up that prudentiall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution for the future, <hi>Si populus decipi vult, decipiatur.</hi>

                     <p>

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:99981:15"/>
stick in your stomach so, <hi>Philalethes,</hi> I much wonder at it. Certainly as fair as you bid for a Magician, yet I perceive you will be no Gypsie by your abhorrencie from this food.</p>
                     <p>But a <hi>Philosophic Hog,</hi> There's a thwack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contumely indeed. Truly you are young, <hi>Eugenius:</hi> and I pray you then please your self, if you had rather be called a Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick pig. But then you would be afraid that some Presbyterian may click you up for a tithe-pig, and eat you. (This is a pig of your own sow, <hi>Phil.</hi> a piece of your own wit.) But being a Philosophick pig you may be secure: That's too tough meat for a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey Presbyter. But I prethee <hi>Phil.</hi> why art thou so offended at the term of <hi>Philosophick Hog?</hi> The meaning is onely, That thou wouldst pretend to see invisible essences, as that creature is said to see the wind. Do's Christ call himself thief, when he sayes that his coming shall be as a thief in the Night: Peace, for shame Caviller, peace.</p>

                     <p>But how will you wipe off that aspersion of calling me naturall fool, sayes wise <hi>Tom.</hi> That indeed I confesse impossible, because it was never yet laid on.

But he hath not done so, nor is <hi>Tom Vaughan</hi> a naturall fool I dare

swear for him. He has too much naturall heat to be a naturall fool. Blesse thee from mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, <hi>Tom,</hi> and all will be well.</p>
                     <p>But there is yet something else behind' worse then all this: That all these terms of incivilitie must proceed from spight and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation. And this you place betwixt the two bilious tumours you have raysed, as a <hi>ductus communis,</hi> or common chanel to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey the sharp malignant humour to swell them to the full. It is true, my words run thus; <hi>That I have been very fair with you, and though provoked, &amp;c.</hi> But this was spoken in the person of an <hi>Aristotelean,</hi> whom your scornfull usage of their Master <hi>Aristotle</hi> you may be sure did and does provoke. But in good truth, <hi>Philalethes,</hi> you did not provoke me at all with your book, unlesse to laugh at you for your Puerilities. I but you have an argument for it, that I was provoked, <hi>viz.</hi> Because your <hi>Theomagicall</hi> discourse has so out-done or undone my <hi>Ballade of the Soul</hi> (as you scornfully call it) that my ignorance in the <hi>Platonick</hi> Philosophy has now appeared to the world. <hi>O rem ridiculam!</hi> Thou art a

What a <hi>Suffenus</hi> art thou in the esteeming of thy own works, O <hi>Eugenius?</hi> and of what a pitifull spirit dost thou take <hi>Alazonomastix</hi> to be? I do professe <hi>ex animo,</hi> that I could heartily wish that my self were the greatest <hi>Ignaro</hi> in the world, upon condition I were really no more ignorant then I am: So little am I touched with precellency or out-strip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping others. (But thou judgest me to have wrote out of the same intoxicating Principle that thou thy self hast, that is, vain glory.) Or however if there was any thing of that when I wrote those Poems, which, I thank God, if any, was very little; yet long ago (I praise that power that inabled me) I brought it down to a degree far lesse then thy unta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:99981:20"/>
that men judging that this affectation of <hi>Platonisme</hi> in you, might well proceed from some <hi>intemperies</hi> of bloud and spirit; and that, there no body else besides us two dealing with these kinds of notions, they might yoke me with so disordered a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion as your self: Reasoning thus with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; <hi>Vaughan</hi> of <hi>Jesus</hi> in <hi>Oxenford</hi> holds the <hi>pre-existencie of the Soul,</hi> and other <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonick</hi> Paradoxes, and we see what a pickle he is in: What think you of <hi>More</hi> of <hi>Christ's,</hi> that writ the <hi>Platonicall Poems?</hi> Nay, what think you of <hi>Platonisme</hi> it self?

of the soul at all (yea, though we had that power upon lawfull terms) if compared with this. And as for divine knowledge, there is none truly so called, without it.

This is the Darling of God, and a Prince amongst men, farre above the dispensation of either Miracle or Prophesie.

                     <p>From this Principle which I have here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:99981:22"/>
have all those Poems I have wrote had their Originall: and as many as are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with them aright, they carry them to this Principle from whence they came. But to those, whose ignorance makes them contemn them, I will onely say to them what our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour said to <hi>Nicodemus; The wind bloweth where it listeth and thou hearest the sound there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, but knowest not from whence it comes nor whither it goes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But I am afraid I have stood all this time in a little too high a station for thee, my <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lalethes:</hi> I descend now and come a little nearer to thee. And now I tell thee further, that thy rash and unworthy abuse of <hi>Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Cartes</hi> did move me to write so as I did, more then any personall regard else whatsoever. For I love the Gentleman for his excellent and transcendent naturall wit, and like his Philosophy as a most rationall, coherent, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till peice, and an Hypothesis accurately and continuedly agreeing with the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Nature. This is he whom thou callest my fellow fool, to thy own great disparagement. But this is he that I call the wisest Naturalist
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:99981:23"/>
that ever came to my hands. And having not had the good hap to light on such a rare peice of my own invention, I thought it was the best office I could do the world to bestow my judgement and censure of his. And so now you will say I am become so great a <hi>Cartesian</hi> that I begin to think but meanly of <hi>Platonisme.</hi> A wise inference! as if <hi>divine</hi> and <hi>naturall</hi> knowledge were inconsistent. I tell thee no, <hi>Philalethes:</hi> Nor am I become cold to my own Poems. For I say that that divine spirit and life that lyes under them, is worth not onely all the Magick that thou pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est to, but all that thou art ignorant of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, yea, and <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> his Philosophy to boot. I say it is worth all that a thousand times told over. <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> Philosophy is indeed a fine neat subtill thing, but for the true ornament of the mind bears no greater proportion to that Principle I told you of, then the dry bones of a snake made up ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly into a hatband, to the royall clothing of Solomon. But other naturall Philosophies in respect of <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> his, are even lesse then a few chips of wood to a well erected
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:99981:23"/>
Fabrick. But I say that a free divine univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salized spirit is worth all. How lovely, how magnificent a state is the soul of man in, when the life of God inactuating her, shoots her along with himself through Heaven and Earth, makes her unite with, and after a sort feel herself animate the whole world, as if she had become God and all things: This is the precious clothing and rich ornament of the mind, farre above reason or any other experiment. And in this attire thou canst not but dance to that Musick of the Sibylle.</p>

up from the clotty dark Personality of this compacted body. Here is love, here is free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, here is justice and equity in the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>essentiall causes of them. He that is here, looks upon all things as one, and on himself, if he can then mind himself, as a part of the whole. And so hath no self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interest, no unjust malicious plot, no more then the hand hath against the foot, or the ear against the eye. This is to be godded with God, and Christed with Christ, if you be in love with such affected language. But you, O ye cages of unclean birds, that have so begodded your selves, that you are grown foul and black like brutes or devils, what will become of you? O you sinks of sinne! You that have heretofore followed religion to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse you from reall righteousnesse and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and now have found a trick to be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minably wicked without any remorse of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science. You are Gods and Goddesses every bit of you, and all actions in you divine. He leads you up into the bed of a whore, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cases you both for the unclean Act. And when you tell obscene stories in a rapture,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:99981:24"/>
you are caught up into God. O you foul mouthes! You blebs of venery, you bags of filth! You dishonour of Christendome and reproach of men! Is not all this righteously come upon you, because you never sought after Religion, as a thing within you, holy, and divine; but as an excuse to save you from wrath, and yet to remain in your sinnes? But that cannot be: You are in the fewell of wrath while you are in your sinnes, and that fewell will be set on fire some time or other. But that you may be secure of wrath you say there is no sinne, but that it is onely a conceit and a name. Is it not a sinne to be lesse hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py ten thousand times then God would have you? Doth not both sense and reason disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to you, (I am sure it doth to others) that you walk in the wayes of Hell and death? But you are still secure, you your selves are as much God as any thing else is, and so you may make your Hell as favourable to your selves as you please. But O you fools and blind! I see you cannot, but you are entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with the cords and snares that the divine <hi>Nemesis</hi> hath laid for the wicked in all the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:99981:25"/>
parts of the world. But you are not yet any thing moved, O ye dead in trespasses and sinnes! For there is no God, say you, more then a dog or a horse is God. Behold, O ye forlorn wretches and miserably mistaken! Behold, He is come down to you: nay, He is ever with you and you see him not. Ask of him, and He shall answer you. Demand of him, and He shall declare unto you, not in obscure words or dark sayings, not in aenig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall speeches or parables; but He will speak unto your own reason and faculties which he hath given you: propound therefore unto him why you think the soul of man is mortall, and why you deny an omnipotent and omniscient God distinct from Nature &amp; particular Beings: propound unto Him, and He will plainly answer you. But alas! alas! you are neither fit to hear nor able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, for you have destroyed those faculties that he hath given you by sinning against the light of them, and now you have drunk out your eyes, you swear there is no Sun in the Firmament: and now you have whored away your brains, you are confident there is
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:99981:25"/>
no God. O sunk and helplesse generation! how have you sop'd and soaked, overflown and drown'd the highest seat and <hi>Acropolis</hi> of your soul, that through your sensuality it is grown as rotten and corrupt as a dunghill? You have made your selves as fit to judge of reason as if your heads were stuffed with wet straw. These things hath the divine Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion uttered against you, but more for reproof then reproach. But your sinne hath made you sottish, and your sottishnesse confident and secure. But his anger burns against you; O you false Religionists! and the wrath of God will overtake you when you are not aware: and your shame shall ascend up like the smoke of the bottomlesse pit, and your stink shall be as the filthinesse in the valley of the children of Hinnom. This will be the portion of all those that barter away sound reason and the sober faculties of the soul for boisterous <hi>words of vanity,</hi> and unsetled conceits of Enthusiasts, that having neither reason nor scripture nor conspicuous miracle, row down with the stream of mens corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions and ripen and hasten the unclean part
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:99981:26"/>
in man, to a more full and speedy birth of sinne and ungodlinesse. But what's all this to me? saith <hi>Philalethes.</hi> I tell thee, <hi>Phil.</hi> I nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wrote before nor do I now write onely for thy sake, but for as many as my writings may reach for their good. Nor am I out of my wits as some may fondly interpret me in this divine freedome. But the love of God compelled me. Nor am I at all, <hi>Philalethes,</hi> Enthusiasticall. For God doth not ride me as a horse, and guide me I know not whither my self; but converses with me as a friend, and speaks to me in such a Dialect as I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand fully, and can make others under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that have not made shipwrack of the faculties that God hath given them, by su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition or sensuality: for with such I can not converse, because they do not converse with God; but onely pity them, or am angry with them, as I am merry and pleasant with thee. For God hath permitted to me all these things, and I have it under the broad seal of Heaven. Who dare charge me? God doth acquit me. For he hath made me full Lord of the foure elements, and hath consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:99981:26"/>
me Emperour of the world. I am in the <hi>fire of choler</hi> and am not burned: In the <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of phlegme</hi> and am not drowned: In the <hi>aiery sanguine</hi> and yet not blown away with every vain blast of transient pleasure, or false doctrines of men: I descend also into the sad <hi>earthy Melancholy,</hi> and yet am not buryed from the sight of my God. I am, <hi>Philalethes,</hi> (though I dare say thou takest me for no bird of Paradise) <hi>Incola coeli in terrâ,</hi> an inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant of Paradise, and Heaven upon Earth: and the <hi>white stone</hi> is mine, however thou scramblest for the Philosophers stone. (I wish thou hadst them both, that is all the harm I wish thee.) I still the raging of the sea, I clear up the lowring Heavens, and with my breath blow away the clouds. I sport with the beasts of the Earth, the Lion licks my hand like a Spaniell, and the Serpent sleeps upon my lap and stings me not. I play with the fowls of Heaven, and the birds of the Air sit singing on my fist. All the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is before me, and I call every one of them by their proper names. This is the true <hi>Adam,</hi> O <hi>Philalethes:</hi> This is Paradise, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:99981:27"/>
and Christ. All these things are true in a sober sense. And the Dispensation I live in, is more happinesse above all measure, then if thou couldst call down the Moon so near thee by thy Magick charms that thou might<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est kisse her, as she is said to have kissed <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dymion,</hi> or couldest stop the course of the Sunne, or which is all one, with one stamp of thy foot, stay the motion of the Earth. All this externall power in Nature were but as a shop of trinkets and toyes, in comparison of what I have declared unto you. And an <hi>adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous generation</hi> onely <hi>seeks after a signe,</hi> or idiots, such as love to stare on a dexterous jugler when he playes his tricks. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they being of so little consideration in themselves; I see and am satisfied why mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles are no more frequent in the world. God intends an higher dispensation, and greater happinesse for these later times, wherein Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Love and Reason, and for their sakes Liberty will lay claim to the stage. For He will as I told you <hi>draw</hi> us with the <hi>cords of a man,</hi> not <hi>ride</hi> us as with a <hi>bridle</hi> like a horse, or tug us along like a mad stear in a
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:99981:27"/>
band. He will sanctifie our inward faculties, and so take possession of the Earth. But that a man may not deplore what is lamentable, or be angry at what is injurious to God or Goodnesse, or laugh at what is ridiculous, this is not any part of that Law that is made manifest in the Heavenly life, but the arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious precepts of supercilious <hi>Stoicks,</hi> or sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Superstitionists. For God hath sanctified and will sanctifie all these things. Nor am I at all mad or fanatick in all this, O you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experienced and unwise! For as our Saviour said of his body, <hi>touch me and handle me:</hi> so say I of my soul: feel and try all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of it if you can find any crack or flaw in them. Where is my Reason inconsequent, or inconsistent with the Attributes of God, the common Notions of men, the <hi>Phaenone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> of Nature, or with it self? Where is my Phansie distorted, unproportionate, unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per? But for the bottome of all these, that, I confesse, you can not reach to nor judge of, that is <hi>divine sense,</hi> the <hi>white stone,</hi> in which there is a name written that none can read but he that hath it. But for the guidance of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:99981:28"/>
my reason and imagination, they have so safe a Stearsman, <hi>viz.</hi> that Divine touch of my soul with God, and the impregnation of my Understanding from the most High, that judgement and caution have so warily built the outward fabrick of words and phansie, that I challenge any man to discover any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eptitude in them, or incoherencie.</p>
                     <p>And now verily the serious consideration of these weighty matters have so composed my mind, that I find it some difficultie to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compose it into a temper childish enough to converse with my young <hi>Eugenius.</hi> But as high as I have taken my station, I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend, and go lesse my self, to bring him to what is greater. Behold, I leap down as from the top of some white rocky cloud, upon the grassie spot where my <hi>Philalethes</hi> stands, and I shall now begin the game of my personated Enmitie, or sportfull Colluctati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with him.</p>

                        <hi>Line</hi> 21. <hi>A twofold Definition, Accidentall and Essentiall.</hi> That's true, <hi>Phil.</hi> what Fresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man but knows that? But how it is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, I perceive thou dost not know. I am ashamed that I must be fain to rub up in thee the very first rudiments of <hi>Logick,</hi> or rather teach thee them. For couldst thou
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:99981:31"/>
ever forget what is meant by <hi>Accidentall,</hi> what by <hi>Essentiall? Accidentall</hi> is that which may be or not be in a thing, and yet the thing be: As a horse may be a horse, be it black or white. <hi>Essentiall</hi> is that which so belongs to the thing to which it is said to be Essentiall, that the thing cannot be conceiv'd to exist without it. Now, say I, these faculties of Understanding, Reason, and Sense are essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall to the soul of man, because we cannot conceive a soul without a power or facultie of understanding, reasoning, &amp;c. And <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi> has defined a soul from these. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore would a <hi>Peripatetick</hi> say, with an Essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Definition. But <hi>Eugenius,</hi> No: This is but circumstantiall, sayes he. Therefore I do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre, <hi>Eugenius,</hi> that thou dost dream of knowing the very naked substance of the soul; which thou wilt as soon know, as see the wind. And thus I spoke to that that thou must needs mean, if thou meanest any thing: but it is a plain case, thou dost not know thy own meaning. But <hi>Aristotle</hi> doth sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly countenance mine, with what he has verie luckily let fall some where in his <hi>Analyticks;</hi>
                        <pb n="59" facs="tcp:99981:31"/>
And thus is it manifestly true in that sense that you your self meant; That the very es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of any substance is not to be known, nor is there any such Essentiall Definition. This is as true, <hi>Tom. Vaughan,</hi> as two and two are foure, though I do not call you Owl for your ignorance, as you do me for my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. But we shall have another bout again with this, in your <hi>Anima Magica abscondita.</hi>

                        <hi>To have made the world as a Carpenter, of stone and timber.</hi> Thou hast misplaced a comma in the sentence to make a Cavil. Put on thy spectacles, and see if there be any comma before <hi>of</hi> in my Book. If you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood common sense you could not but understand, that my meaning is this; That you tax the <hi>Peripateticks</hi> for phansying God to have made the world as a Carpenter makes houses of stone and timber. Now pitifull Caviller! But to the point. I say this is a false taxation, <hi>Eugenius:</hi> For the parts of the world, according to the <hi>Peripateticks</hi> own doctrine, are set in this order they are from
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:99981:32"/>
an inward principle of motion, and their own proper qualities: so that they do as the stones and trees are said to have done at the musick of <hi>Orphevs</hi> and <hi>Amphion,</hi> move of themselves. But the stone and timber in the work of a Carpenter, do not move themselves into their places they ought to be, for the building up of an house. But you answer two things to this: First, that the parts of the world do not move themselves: Secondly, that if they do, then they have infusion of life. To the first: Why, dos not any part of the earth move it self downward, if it be in an higher place then is naturall to it, and the aire and fire upward, &amp;c. and this from an inward principle of motion? Nay, is not the very definition of Nature, <hi>Principium motûs &amp; quietis, &amp;c.</hi> wherefore we see plainly, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Aristoteleans,</hi> all to the very concave of the Moon have an inward princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of motion. And for the Heavens them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, the most sober and cautious of the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripateticks</hi> hold them to be moved from an inward Principle, their <hi>Forma informans,</hi> as they call it. So that though they do not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:99981:32"/>
life infused into the world, yet they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low an inward principle of motion in natural bodies, which is their Substantiall Forms, by vertue whereof they are ranged in this order as we see; or at least according to which they are thus ranged and ordered. And this is not so dead a businesse as the Carpenters building with stone and timber. But in the second place, you say, That if they have this motion from an inward principle, then they have also infusion of life. But do not you see plainly, that (according to the mind of the more sober <hi>Peripateticks</hi>) they have motion from an inward principle? Therefore you should have been so far from taxing them to look upon God as a Carpenter, that you should have concluded rather that they held infusion of life.</p>

                        <hi>Lin.</hi> I. <hi>Thou hast abused me basely.</hi> Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if that were true I shonld be very sorrie for it: For I would not willingly abuse any man living, of what condition soever. But the thing has happened unluckily. I read thy Book, I knew not thy person, nor thy name,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:99981:33"/>
nor thy nature, further then it was exprest in thy Book, which did not represent it so ill as now I find it. If I had thought my <hi>Galenical</hi> purge had met with such a constitution, I should have tempered it more carefully: For I delight not in the vexation of any man. The truth is, my scope in writing that Book was laudable and honest, and such as might become a very good Christian, and my mirth and pleasantnesse of mind much and reall; but the sharpnesse of my style personated, and <hi>Aristotelicall;</hi> and therefore being but affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and fictitious, I felt it not, there was no corrosion at all; but all that was unkind in it, (if you will call that passion unkindnesse) was a certain light indignation that I bore, and ever do bear against <hi>magnificent folly.</hi> And there being no name to your Book, I thought I had the opportunity of doing it with the least offence, as meeting with the thing dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned and singled from the person. But I verily think I should not have medled at all, if you had spared your incivilities to <hi>Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Chartes,</hi> whose worth and skill in naturall Philosophy (be it fate or judgement that
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:99981:33"/>
constrains me to it let the world judge) I can not but honour and admire. He is rayled at but not confuted by any that I see, in his naturall Philosophy, and that's the thing I magnifie him for. Though his Metaphysicks have wit and strength enough too, and he hath made them good against his opposers.</p>

I am dead, and thou thy self but mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, wilt thou entertain immortall enmity against me? But how canst thou persecute me being dead? Wilt thou raise my soul up, <hi>O Magicus,</hi> by thy <hi>Necromancy?</hi> and then combate with me over my grave? I hope thou art but in jest, <hi>Eugenius:</hi> If thou beest not, I must tell thee in good earnest, thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent bitternesse will make thee <hi>Simon Magus</hi> like, as well as thy former boasting. O thou confounded and undone thing! how hast thou shamed thy self! Thy vizard is fallen off, and thy sanctimonious clothing torn from
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:99981:34"/>
about thee, even as it was with the Apes and Monkies, that being attired like men and wearing vizards over their faces did daunce, and cringe, and kisse, and do all the gestures of men so artificially and becomingly, that the Countrey people took them to be a lesser size of humane race, till a waggish fellow that had more with then the rest, dropt a few nuts amongst them, for which they fell a scrambling so earnestly, that they tore off their vizards, and to the great laughter of the spectatours, show'd what manner of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures they were. O <hi>Magicus!</hi> do not dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble before me: For thou dost not know with what eyes I behold thee. Were it not better for thee and all the world beside, to make it their businesse to be really and fully possest of those things that are undoubtedly good and Christian, nay, indeed if they be had in the right Principle, are the very buds and branches of the tree of Paradise, the limbs and members of the Divine nature, such as are meeknesse, patience, and humility, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, freedome from self-interest, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stity, temperance, equity, and the like: is it
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:99981:34"/>
not better to seek after these things, then to strain at high words and uncertain flatuous notions that do but puff up the mind and make it seem full to it self, when it is distend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with nothing but unwholsome wind. Is not this very true, my dear <hi>Philatethes?</hi>

                        <hi>Line</hi> II. <hi>Upon certain similitudes and ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies of mine.</hi> Now we are come to that rare piece of <hi>Zoography</hi> of thine, the world drawn out in the shape of an <hi>Animal.</hi> But let's view the whole draught as it lies in your book, because you make such a foul noise about it in your answer. Your words are these. <hi>Besides the texture of the Universe clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly discovers its Animation. The Earth which is the visible naturall Basis of it, represents the grosse carnall parts. The element of the water answers to the bloud, for in it the pulse of the great world beats; this most men call the flux and reflux, but they know not the true cause of it. The air is the outward refreshing spirit, where this vast creature breathes though invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly yet not insensibly: The interstellar skies are his vitall ethereall waters, and the starres his animall sensuall fire.</hi> Now to passe my cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:99981:35"/>
on this rare <hi>Zoographicall</hi> peice. I tell thee if thy brains were so confusedly scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered as thy phansie is here, thou wert a dead man <hi>Philalethes:</hi> all the Chymistry in the world could not recover thee. Thou art so u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitive a soul, <hi>Phil.</hi> and such a clicker at the slightest shadows of similitude, that thou wouldst not stick to match chalk and cheese together I perceive, and mussitate a marriage betwixt an Apple and an Oyster. Even those proverbiall dissimilitudes have something of similitude in them, will you then take them for similes that have so monstrous a dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion and dissimilitude? But you are such a Sophister that you can make any thing good. Let's try. The Earth must represent the flesh because they both be grosse: so is chalk and cheese, or an Apple and an Oy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster. But what think you of the Moon? is not that as much green cheese as the Earth is flesh? what think you of <hi>Venus,</hi> of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi> and the rest of the Planets? which they that know any thing in Nature, know to be as much flesh as the Earth is, that is to be dark &amp; opake as well as shee. What! is this flesh of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:99981:35"/>
the world then torn apeices and thrown a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, scattered here and there like the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynted limbs of dragg'd <hi>Hippolytus?</hi> Go to <hi>Phil:</hi> where are you now with your fine knacks and similitudes? But to the next A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalogie. <hi>The element of water answers to the bloud.</hi> Why? <hi>For in it is the pulse of the great world.</hi> But didst thou ever feel the pulse of the Moon? And yet is not there water too? thou little, sleepy heedlesse <hi>Endymion:</hi> The bloud is restagnant there, I warrant you, and hath no pulse. So that the man with the thorns on his back lives in a very unwholesome region. But to keep to our own station here upon Earth. Dost thou know what thou sayest when thou venturest to name that monosyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable, <hi>Pulse,</hi> dost thou know the causes and the laws of it? Tell me, my little Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaster; where is there in the earth or out of the earth in this <hi>World-Animal</hi> of thine, that which will answer to the heart, and the sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stole and diastole thereof to make this pulse? And beside this, There is wanting rarefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and universall diffusion of the stroke at once. These are in the pulse of a true <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal,</hi>
                        <pb n="68" facs="tcp:99981:36"/>
but are not to be found in the Flux of the sea; For it is not in all places at once, nor is the water rarefied where it is. Now my pretty Parabolist, what is there left to make your similitude good for a pulse in your great <hi>Animal</hi> more then when you spill your pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, or shog a milk-bowl? But believe it <hi>Eugenius,</hi> thou wilt never make sense of this Flux and Reflux, till thou calm thy phansie so much as to be able to read <hi>Des-Cartes.</hi> But to tell us it is thus from an inward form, <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re Aristotelico,</hi> is to tell us no more, then that it is the nature of the Beast, or to make La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine words by adding onely the termination <hi>bus,</hi> as <hi>hosibus</hi> and <hi>shoosibus,</hi> as Sir <hi>Kenhelm Digby</hi> hath with wit and judgement applied the compárison in like case. But now to put the bloud, flesh and bones together, of your <hi>World-Animal:</hi> I say they bear not so great a proportion to the more fluid parts, viz. the vitall and animal spirits thereof, as a mite in a cheese to the whole globe of the Earth. So that if thou hadst any phansie or judgement in thee, thy similitude would appear to thine own self outragiously ugly and dispropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:99981:36"/>
and above all measure ridiculous: Nor do not think to shuffle it off, by demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, If there be so little earth, to tell thee where it is wanting. For I onely say, that if the world be an <hi>Animal,</hi> there will be much bloud and flesh wanting, <hi>Philalethes,</hi> for so great a Beast. Nor do not you think to blind my eyes with your own Tobacco smoke, (I take none my self, <hi>Eugenius,</hi>) For to that over ordinary experiment, I answer two things. First, that as you look upon the parts of the body of a true <hi>Animal,</hi> in the same extension that they now actually are, not how they may be altered by rarefaction; so you are also to look upon the parts of your <hi>World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Animal,</hi> as they are <hi>de facto</hi> extended, not how they may be by rarefaction. And thus your Argument from Tobacco, will vanish into smoke. But if you will change the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent condition, of any lesser <hi>Animal</hi> by burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, and turning many of the grosse parts into more thinne and fluid, you destroy the ground of your comparison, betwixt the <hi>World-Animal</hi> and it; for you take away the flesh of your lesser <hi>Animal</hi> thus burnt. And
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:99981:37"/>
besides, the proportion betwixt the vapour or thinner parts extension to the remaining ashes, is not yet so big, as of the thin parts of the <hi>World-Animal</hi> in respect of its solid parts, by many thousand and thousand millions. Nay, I shall speak within compasse, if I say (as I said before) that there is a greater dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion then betwixt the globe of the Earth and a mite in a cheese. This is plainly true to any that understands common sense. For the Earth in respect of the World is but as an indivisible point. Adde to all this, that if you will rarefie the Tobacco or <hi>Hercules</hi> body by fire, I will take the same advantage, and say that the water and many parts of the earth may be also rarefied by fire, and then reckon onely upon the remaining ashes of this globe, and what is turned into vapour must be added to the more fluid parts of the <hi>World-Animal,</hi> to increase that over-propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So that thou hast answered most wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly and pitifully every way, poor <hi>Anthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posophus!</hi> But besides, In the second place: When any thing is burnt, as for example, your Tobacco. I say it takes up then no more
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:99981:37"/>
room then it did before: Because Rarefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Condensation is made, <hi>per modum spongiae,</hi> as a sponge is distended by the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in, and contracted again by the going out of the water it had imbib'd. But the <hi>Aristotelicall</hi> way, which is yours, (O pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found <hi>Magicus!</hi> that hast the luck to pick out the best of that Philosophy) implies, I say, grosse contradictions, which thou canst not but understand, if thou canst distinguish cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreall from incorporeall Beings. Thy way of Rarefaction and Condensation, O <hi>Eugeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> must needs imply <hi>penetration of dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,</hi> or something as incongruous, as every lad in our Universities, at a year or two standing at least, is able to demonstrate to thee. But if thou thinkest it hard, that so little a body as a pipe of Tobacco, should be multiplied into so very much superficies above what it had before, go to those that beat out leaf gold, and understand there how the superficies of the same body may be, to wonder, increased. And beside, I could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate to thee, that a body whose basis thou shouldst imagine at the center of the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:99981:38"/>
Earth, &amp; top as far above the starry Heaven, as it is from thence to the Earth, without any condensation used thereunto, is but equall to a body that will lie within the boll of a To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco pipe. Where art thou now, thou mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable Philosophaster? But to the next A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalogie.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The aire is the outward refreshing spirit, where this vast Creature breaths.</hi> Two things I here object, to shew the ineptnesse and inconguity of this comparison. The one is taken from the office of respiration, which is to refresh by way of refrigerating or cooling. Is not the main end of the lungs to cool the bloud, before it enter into the left ventricle of the heart? But thou art so Magical, thou knowst none of these sober and usefull mysteries of Nature. All that thou answerest to this is, That we are refresh'd by heat as well as by coolnesse. Why then, Is that generall suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to make up your analogie or simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude? This is as well phansied as it is reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when men conclude affirmatively in the second figure. There are laws in Phansie too, <hi>Philalethes:</hi> and I shall shew thee anon, how
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:99981:38"/>
ridiculous thou hast made thy self by trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressing them. If thou meanest by refresh'd, to be cheared or restored onely, and what ever do's this must be ground enough to phansie a respiration; then thou breathest in thy cawdle, when thou eatest it, and hast spoyled that conceit of his, that said he never would drink sack whilst he breathed; for if sack do in any sense refresh and comfort a man, it seems he breaths while he drinks. I tell thee in the <hi>Homologi termini</hi> of simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, there ought to be something in some sort peculiar and restrained, or else it is flat, ridiculous, and non-sense. The other obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction was taken from the situation of this aire that is to be the matter of Respiration in this great <hi>Animal.</hi> What a wild difference is there in this? The aire that an ordinary <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal</hi> breaths in, is externall, the aire of this <hi>world-Animal,</hi> internall; so that it is rather wind in the guts, then aire for the lungs; and therefore we may well adde the <hi>Cholick</hi> to the <hi>Anasarca.</hi> Is the wind-Cholick an outward refreshing spirit, or an inward griping pain? Being thou hast no guts in thy brains, I su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:99981:39"/>
thy brains have slipt down into thy guts, whither thy tongue should follow to be able to speak sense. Answer now like an <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, O thon man of Magick! He answers, and the point and sting of all the sense of his answer is in the tail of it: <hi>pag.</hi> 29. <hi>lin.</hi> 11. <hi>and it is their outward refreshing spirit.</hi> He means the Earths and the Waters. O feeble sting! O foolish answer! This onely reaches so far as to save the Earth alive from my jugulating objection. The globe of Earth and Water indeed may be still an <hi>Animal</hi> for all that objection. But thou saidst the whole world was an <hi>Animal.</hi> What, is the whole world an <hi>Animal</hi> because the Earth is one? O bundle of simples! (to return thee thine own parcell of ware again, for it belongs not to me) this is as well argued as if thou should<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est say, That a cheese is an <hi>Animal,</hi> because there is one living mite in it. But that this Earth neither is a breathing <hi>Animal,</hi> is plain enough: For what respiration, what attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and reddition of aire is there in it? There may be indeed something answering to sweating and perspiration, nothing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:99981:39"/>
my good <hi>Philalethes.</hi> But to shew thee thy folly, I will follow thy liberty, and impudently pronounce that a pair of bellows is an <hi>Animal.</hi> Why, is it not? It has a nose to breathe through, that's plain, the two han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles are the two eares, the leather the lungs, and that which is the most seemly analogie of all, the two holes in the back-side are the two eyes; as like the eyes in the fore-side of a Crab as ever thou seest any thing in thy life: Look thee, <hi>Phil.</hi> are they not? You 'll say, The analogie of the nose is indeed as plain as the nose on a mans face: But how can the handles be eares, when they stand one behind another? whereas the eares of <hi>Animals</hi> stand one on one side, and the other on the other side of the head. And then, how can the leather be lungs, they being the very out-side of its body? Or those two holes eyes? They have neither the situation, as being placed behind, nor office of eyes. Answer me all these objections, O <hi>Mastix!</hi> I can fully answer them, O <hi>Magicus!</hi> This is an <hi>Animal</hi> drawn out according to thine own skill and principles. The leather sayst
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:99981:40"/>
thou must be no lungs, because it is without. Why then the aire must be no aire for thy <hi>World-Animal</hi> to breath, because it is within: And if thou canst dispence with <hi>within</hi> and <hi>without,</hi> much more mayst thou with <hi>before</hi> and <hi>behind,</hi> or <hi>behind</hi> and <hi>on the sides.</hi> So the eares and lungs of this <hi>Animal</hi> hold good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst thee still. Now to preserve my mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters eyes against this <hi>Harpy</hi> that would scratch them out. They are no eyes say you, because they have not the situation of eyes. But I told thee before, thou makest nothing of situation. But they have not the office of eyes. Why? They can see as much as the eyes of thy <hi>World-Animal,</hi> for ought thou knowest. I but this <hi>Bellows-Animal</hi> breaths at these eyes: And have not I shewed thee that thy <hi>World-Animal</hi> breaths in his guts? But I will make it plain to thee that those two holes are eyes: For they are two, as the two eyes are; and transmit the thin aire through them, as the eyes do the pure light. So that they agree gainly well in the generall: As your Respiration in the <hi>World-Animal,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing, though by heat, when in others it is
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:99981:40"/>
by cold. Fie on thee, for a <hi>Zoographicall</hi> Bungler.

                        <hi>The interstellar skies are his vitall ethereall waters.</hi> Here I object, <hi>O Eugenius!</hi> that there is an over-proportionated plenty of those waters in thy <hi>World-Animal,</hi> and that thus thou hast distended the skin of thy <hi>Animal,</hi> God knows how many millions of miles off from the flesh. O prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Anasarca!</hi> But what dost thou answer here? <hi>viz.</hi> That I say, that the body which we see betwixt the starres, namely, the interstellar waters, is excessive in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion. No, I do not say so: but that they are two excessive in proportion to be the fluid parts of a <hi>World-Animal.</hi> But how ever, as if I had said so, he goes about to prove, that there is no excesse of proportion in them. <hi>Dost thou hear, Mastix?</hi> sayes he, <hi>Look up and see.</hi> Well, I hear, <hi>Phil.</hi> I look up. But do
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:99981:41"/>
not chock me under the chin, thou wag, when I look up. Now, what must I see? <hi>What a number of bonefires, lamps, and torches are kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in that miraculous celestiall water.</hi> Yes, I see them all. I suppose they burn so clear for joy and triumph, that my Reason and Sense have so victoriously overthrown thy Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastry and Non-sense. But why miraculous waters, <hi>Phil?</hi> I see the cause: Bonefires and torches burn in the waters. That were a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle indeed, <hi>Eugenius;</hi> but that it is a falsity. Thou givest things false names, and then wouldst amaze us with verbal miracles.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And the starres his animal sensuall fire.</hi> What is thy meaning here, little <hi>Phil.</hi> (For I never called thee to account for this yet) That this <hi>World-Animal</hi> has sense onely in the starres? To call them the eyes of the world is indeed pretty and Poeticall. And <hi>Plato's</hi> delicious spirit may seem to countenance the conceit in that elegant Distich upon his young friend <hi>Aster,</hi> (which in plain English is <hi>Starre</hi>) whom he instructed in the Art of Astronomie:</p>

                     <p>But what, <hi>Eugenius,</hi> wilt thou venture in Philosophick coolnesse, to say the sense of thy <hi>World-Animal</hi> lies in the starres? I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thee, what can those starry eyes spy out of the world? They are very quick-sighted, if they can see there, where there is nothing to be seen. But it may be, this <hi>Animal</hi> turns its eyes inward and views it self. I would <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lethes</hi> were such an <hi>Animal</hi> too; He would then find so much amisse within, that he would forbear hereafter to be so censorious without. But what? is there sense then one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the starres? For sense can be no where but where there is accesse for the Animal spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. So it seems, the starres must hear as well as see, nay, feel and tast; as they do questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onlesse, as often as they lick in, and eat up that starre-fodder, the vapours, wherewith in <hi>Seneca,</hi> they are phantastically said to be nourished. And thus you see, that <hi>Tom Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghans Animal,</hi> I mean the bellows now, may see at the very same two holes that it breathes
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:99981:42"/>
at, for he confounds all by his indiscreet phansie. How art thou blown about like a feather in the air, O thou light-minded <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genius!</hi> How vain and irrationall art thou in every thing! Art thou the Queen of <hi>Sheba,</hi> as thy Sanguin a little overflowing thy Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler would dresse up thy self to thy soft ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, and make thee look smugg in thy own eyes? Had that Queen so little manners, in her addresses to so great a Philosopher? No, thy language in all thy book, is the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of a scold and of a slut. And for thy wit, if thou wilt forgo thy right to the ladle and bells, thy feminine brains as thou callest them, may lay claim to the <hi>maid-marians</hi> place in the Morris-dance: while my strong cruds, (as thou tearmest my masculine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding) which are as sweet as strong, not tainted with the fumes of either revenge or Venery, shall improve their utmost strength, for the interest of Truth and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</p>
                     <p>And thus have I taken all thy Outworks, <hi>Eugenius,</hi> yea and quite demolished them. Yet now I look better about me, there is I
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:99981:42"/>
perceive one Half-moon standing still. Wherefore have at thy Lunatick answer to that which thou callest my Lunatick argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which thou propoundest thus; <hi>That the Flux and Reflux cannot be the pulse of the great World, because it proceeds from the Moon, not from the Sunne.</hi> I say, <hi>Philalethes,</hi> The Sunne being the heart of the world, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to those that be more discreetly phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall (consult D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fludd,</hi> thou art but a bad chip of that block) it was to be expected, if thou wouldst have the Flux and Reflux to be the Pulse, that it should come from the Sun, that is reputed the heart of the world, but it comes from the Moon. To this you answer; That it comes no more from the Moon, then from that fictitious <hi>Anti-selene</hi> or <hi>Anti-moon,</hi> as you venture to call it. You say thus, but prove nothing. But there is such an apparent connexion betwixt this <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> of the Flux and Reflux, and so constant with the course of the Moon, that it is even unimagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable but that there should be the relation of cause and effect betwixt them. But I think you will not say, That the motion of the Sea
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:99981:43"/>
has any power or effect upon the course of the Moon; wherefore it must be granted, than the course of the Moon has an effectuall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon the Flux of the Sea. And therefore <hi>Fromondus</hi> speaks very expressely concerning this matter, and very perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily in these words: <hi>Si ex effect is de causa con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectatio valere potest, tam compertum videtur aestus effici &amp; gubernari à Lunari sydere, quàm calorem ab ignibus effundi, aut lumen à Sole:</hi> to this sense; <hi>If we can gather any thing from effects concerning the cause, it seems to be as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentally sure, that the Ebbing and Flowing of the Sea is made and governed by the Moon, as that heat flows from the fire, or light from the Sunne.</hi> For indeed how could there be kept such inviolable laws, as that the Ocean should alwayes swel at the Moons ascending; and not onely so, but attemperately and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably to her motion, (for she coming every day later and later above the <hi>Horizon,</hi> the Flux of the Sea is later and later everie time, according to her recession toward the East in her monethly course) I say, How could these laws be so accurately observed,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:99981:43"/>
                        <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Eugenius,</hi> if the Moon were not accesso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to, nay, the principall causer of this Flux and Reflux of the Sea? And if thou beest not wilfully blind, this is enough to convince thee, that that which thou callest the Pulse of thy <hi>World-Animal,</hi> is from the Moon not from the Sunne, nor from its own inward form. For thou seest it is caused and regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by an externall <hi>Agent.</hi> But for a more full discoverie of this mysterie, I send thee to <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> in the fourth part of his <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipia Philosophiae,</hi> or to what I have taken from thence and made use of in the Notes upon my <hi>Philosophicall Poems.</hi> In which Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ems the intelligent Reader may understand, how far, and in what sense, any sober <hi>Platonist</hi> will allow the world to be an Animal. Nor do's one part of it acting upon another, as the Moon upon the Sea, hinder its Animation. For in men and beasts, one part of the bodie do's plainly act upon another, though all be actuated by the soul.</p>
                     <p>And now, <hi>Philalethcs,</hi> I have taken all thy Out-works, none excepted; out of which thou hast shot many a slovingly shot against
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:99981:44"/>
me. But thy foul piece has recoyled against thy self, in all sober mens opinions, and has beat thee backward into the dirt. And truly, I know not whether I should pity thee, or laugh at thy childish Arsbut thou hast given thy self. For thou railest at me now thou art down, and threatnest him that is ready to set thee up upon thy feet, provided thou wilt not prick up thy eares too, and look too spruntly upon the businesse. But thou want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est no help, thou art a Giant, an invincible man of warre, great <hi>Goliah</hi> of <hi>Gath.</hi> I a mere Punie, as thou callest me; nay, a Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key, a Mouse. What, dost thou bid defiance to three at once, <hi>Philalethes?</hi> I tell thee, any one of these three would be hard enough for thee. But what wilt thou do, now thou art to deal with a man? For I shall fight with thee, onely with a mans weapon, Reason. As for thy raylings and quibblings, I shall not take notice of them; so that the battel is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be the sharper and shorter for it. Onely let's be a little merry at the beginning, it will be like shaking of hands at the taking up of the cudgells.</p>

                     <q>Art thou the hobling Poet who sometime — Prays'd with his quill Plato's Philosophie?</q>
                     <p>I am the Poet that did, and do with my pen, my mouth, and from my heart praise that excellent Philosophy of <hi>Plato,</hi> as the most consistent and coherent Metaphysicall <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> that has yet been found out by the wit of man. But why hobling Poet? thou hobling Asse or Hobby-horse, choose thee whether. Thou hast so diseased and crazie a brain, that it cannot endure it seems the least jotting, and so thou hadst rather be carried in a Sedan, as those that are rotten with the <hi>Neopolitan</hi> disease, or else going the way to it; then be bravely hurryed in my open ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnificent chariot, whose tempestuous wheels dance and leap while they are wearing down the cragginesse and asperity of Philosophick difficulties into plainnesse and easinesse. But I know the vulgar, those poore Merchants of eel-skins, that deal with nothing but the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uviae</hi> of things, words and phrases, are more
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:99981:45"/>
taken with smooth Non-sense, or superficiall flourishes, then with the deepest knowledge in a carelesse dresse. Dost thou not know that those men, that make it their businesse to be compt and elegant in their clothes and carriages, commonly have little else but this in them? And so it is too often with Poems and other writings. But how I slight your simple censures, O ye skin-sucking flies! ye wasps with rush-stings in your tayls! yee winged inhabitants of <hi>Crowland!</hi> I will shew you now, not in the prose of <hi>More,</hi> but in the very Trot and Loll of <hi>Spencer,</hi> as this Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall with his tongue lolling out of his drive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling mouth, uncivilly calls it.</p>

                     <p>Nor have I here called my self Clown by craft, no more then the Poet calls the Knight so. But thy indiscreet wit cannot distinguish betwixt the <hi>Formale</hi> and <hi>Materiale,</hi> of that whence the similitude is fetched; which made theee so ill digest thy Philosophick Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con. It was thine own Magick, <hi>Phil.</hi> or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse imagination that turned thee into an Hog with tusks and bristles, not I. But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the businesse: O thou judicious Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick! What is the fault? where is the flaw in what thou hast recited?</p>
                     <q>— Praise with my quill Plato's Philosophy.</q>
                     <p>Thou dost onely play with the feather of the quil. But for what is writ with the inky end thereof, in those Poems of mine, I challenge thee to shew me if thou canst, where my phansie or reason hath really tript. Thou indeed hast attempted something in the <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonick</hi> way, but I have made it manifest, thou hast writ with the quil of a goose. But I have penned down the praise of <hi>Plato's</hi> Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy in this Canto, with the skill of a man, as any man that hath skill will acknowledge,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:99981:46"/>
But thy spirit is not yet prepared for the knowledge of such divine matters. It is not yet fine, gentle, and benigne enough, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive so delicious impressions. Put thy soul into a crysiple, O pragmaticall <hi>Chymist,</hi> and set it on that fire, that will excoct and purge out thy drosse, and then judge of <hi>Platonisme.</hi> Art not thou the Chymicall Monkey that art very busie to little purpose about the glasses of <hi>Harry Blunden,</hi> an honest man and an happy Operatour in Chymistry as I hear? But thou dost nothing but lear and look up at the reek of the furnace, and sendest as high <hi>Theomagicall</hi> meditations after every fold or curle of smoke that mounteth up, as the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Ape after the flur and farre flight of every partridge he let out of the basket. But enough of Levity. Now to expiate the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of this mirth with something more so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid and sober. I am ready to answer what thou alleadgest, and to make good that my first observation is no oversight.</p>
                     <p>Thou art here mistaken in two things. First, in that thou conceivest that Reminis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency is so strong an argument to prove the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:99981:46"/>
Preexistency of the soul before her entrance into the body. I say it is not any argument worth the insisting upon. For though the soul do finde truth in her self, questions being wisely proposed to her; yet she doth not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that she ever thought of those things before, and therefore cannot acknowledge any such Reminiscency in herself. And I appeal unto thine own reason, <hi>Eugenius,</hi> if God should create an humane soul, and put it into a body fit and complyable with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, whether that soul would not be able to answer all the questions propounded in <hi>Plato's Meno,</hi> as well as those that are sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to preexist. And therefore I have not made use of this argument in all my <hi>Platonical</hi> Poems. For I tell thee, <hi>Phil.</hi> I am a very wary Philosopher, and he must rise betimes that goes about to impose upon my reason. Thy second mistake is, that thou thinkest I condemn thy opinion of the Preexistency of the soul, which indeed I might well do as personating an <hi>Aristotelean.</hi> But what I real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blame there, is thy boldnesse and disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious rashnesse in the proposall of it,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:99981:47"/>
thou intimating, as if the soul descended into the body with her eyes broad wake, which the first page of thy Praeface to the Reader doth plainly imply. Let any one read and judge. But if any one ask what my opinion is, I answer, It is no matter what my opinion is, as it is mine, (for what man is <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>Here, <hi>Philalethes,</hi> I charged thee with three absurdities.</p>
                     <p>The first was affectation of pomp and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony in the finding out those things which can not be hid from the eyes of the meanest capacity. As pretending it was a whole springs task, to find out this conclusio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, viz. <hi>That things that are produced in Nature, are out of something in Nature unlike the things produced.</hi> To this thou answerest; that thou art not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, as if thou wert a whole spring in finding out this conclusion: For thou onely saist, <hi>I took to task the fruits of one spring.</hi> But I say, that <hi>one spring</hi> may signifie a whole
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:99981:47"/>
spring, and your making a task of it seems to determine the words to that sense. And un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse thou tookest the pains of examining all the flowers that grew in the spring, one after another, I mean their kinds, it would prove no task, or at least be no proof for thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion. And therefore in all likelihood, <hi>one spring</hi> should signifie here a <hi>whole spring.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The second was, that thou art fain to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of two of <hi>Aristotles</hi> Principles, <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Privation.</hi> And this I inferred from the foregoing Conclusion. But thou answerest, <hi>That thou hast not so much as named Privation, much lesse acknowledged it for a Principle.</hi> That's no matter. Though thou hold thy peace thy observations speak it. That <hi>Viola est ex non viola, Rosa ex non Rosa,</hi> &amp;c. Which is the very same thing the Peripateticks observe to be necessarily included in all generation, &amp; therefore they make a Principle of it, and call it <hi>Privation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The third absurditie was, that you seemed so simple, as to promise your self that you would find out the first matter, or the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon matter of all things by experience. To
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:99981:48"/>
which you answer, <hi>That you have now found it out, felt it, and seen it.</hi> Well, <hi>Engenius,</hi> thou art grown a great Proficient, I perceive, since the last time I met thee. For then thou wast to seek for this first matter, now thou hast found it and felt it. Hast not thou felt the Ephi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altes, <hi>Phil?</hi> or is not thy phansie as grosse and thick as a syrup? I believe thou art as much <hi>Jesuite</hi> as I <hi>Puritan,</hi> tell me truly <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lalethes,</hi> dost not equivocate in this answer? and understandest by this <hi>first Matter,</hi> onely the first matter of some things, as meal is the first matter of pudding, and pycrust, and bread, and the like. But if thou saist thou hast seen and felt the first matter of all things whatsoever, thou hast pronounced what is impossible to be proved, and therefore as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to be believed by the sober and wise. And yet unlesse thou pronounce thus, thou pronouncest nothing to the present purpose. For, by <hi>first Matter,</hi> is understood the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon matter of all things. But now to rebuke thy boldnesse in this assertion: Let me ask thee a sober question or two. This <hi>first Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> which thou soughtest after, and now
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:99981:48"/>
hast found, whether hadst thou any marks to know it by, when thou didst light on it? For as <hi>Venus</hi> in the Poet, when she sends hue and cry after her little <hi>Fugitive,</hi> describes him from his marks;</p>
                     <q>
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </q>
                     <p>So what ever is sought for by us, we ought to have an idea of it, that we may know it when we find it. As he that is to seek an horse in the field, if he have not an idea of an horse and of a cow, &amp;c. he may bring one for the other. To be short, he that seeks without an idea of what is sought, seeks for he knows not what, and he will find it he knows not when. So that it was necessary for thee to have an idea of the <hi>first Matter,</hi> in thy mind when thou wentest about to find it out. Now tell me, what the idea of the <hi>first Matter</hi> can be, if not this? <hi>A substance out of which all corporeall things are made, but it self out of nothing.</hi> And this is, if thou understandest truth when it is propounded to thee, as true an idea of the <hi>first Matter,</hi> as, <hi>to have three angles,</hi> is the right idea of a Triangle. But answer me now, <hi>Engenius,</hi> in good earnest.
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:99981:49"/>
Is that matter which thou saist thou hast seen and handled such as will fit with this idea? How canst thou ever prove but that that matter was made of some other matter, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise modified, as well as other things may be made of this? But I will deal very can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly with thee, <hi>Philalethes:</hi> For I would fain have thee speak some sense. The idea of thy <hi>first Matter</hi> thou meanest may happily be this. Matter so prepared and qualified by the Art of <hi>Chymistry,</hi> that it is fit to receive any form whatsoever, or <hi>Matter</hi> that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to such a temper as it all was of at first, when it lay fitted for receiving of all forms of what nature so ever, and by this fitnesse engaged them to lodge in her large bosome. And thus though this <hi>Matter</hi> of thine be made of another matter, yet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is reduced to the state it was in first of all, before it received any forms, and was contrived into this order and distinction of parts, that constitute the world, it may in this sense be called the <hi>first Matter.</hi> But tell me, <hi>Eugenius,</hi> how knowst thou that thou hast light on such a matter as this? Thou hadst
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:99981:49"/>
no preconceived idea of the colour and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistency of this matter, which thou saist thou hast felt and and seen, unlesse somebody hath described it to thee, from certain sensible qualities. But then I would ask both them and thee, how they know that a body of this consistency and colour is the <hi>first matter?</hi> It is either because that they observe, that, what ever they resolve by their <hi>Chymicall</hi> fires is resolved into this at last, or because they have observed that all things will arise out of this matter. But for the first: I say, they have not, nor can make triall of all things by their Art. For how many things appear above us out of our reach? besides what lie eternally buried below. They can not distill the stars, as some say, glow-worms may be, and make them lamps of them to study by. Besides, why is that which is left, to be the first matter more then what is flown away and evaporated? And that which will not evaporate, I demand whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that is the first matter of air and light? Adde to all this, That you do not so much find this first matter as make it in all likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:99981:50"/>
For how incredible a thing is it, but that by your fires or heats, (you putting the body that is under your operation into a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall motion, so that the parts fridge one against another uncessantly) the nature of it should be quite changed by you. So that you do not by a kind of <hi>Analysis</hi> discover what is at the bottome, but by <hi>Genesis</hi> modifie the matter into a new dresse. But that's no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you 'll say, so long as it is reduced to such a temper as it was, when the whole world was to be impregnated with severall forms. But there is no way now left for you to know that you have thus reduced it, unlesse you have seen this matter of yours. <hi>Vertum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>-like to appear before you in all shapes. Tell me then, <hi>Philalethes,</hi> Have you seen it put on the form of a Sponge? of a Pumex? of Adamant? of Marble? Have you seen it put on the shape of all plants whatsoever and Animals? to say nothing of metals and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralls. Have you play'd with it in the shape of a dog? or has it roared against you in the form of a lion? or have you made sport with the mustacho's of it in the figure of a
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:99981:50"/>
mouse? Ha's <hi>Paracelsus</hi> his <hi>homunculus</hi> come tumbling out of it, with his tail upwards in signe of good luck? or hast thou conferr'd with it in the dresse of a wanton Ladie, cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with transparent lawns, or Sybariticall tiffanies? If thou hast not, (and darest thou say thou hast?) thou hast no reason at all to say thou hast seen and felt the first matter of all things. It is but vain boasting and bold imposture. Adde unto all this; That if there were any such matter as thou meanest, so fit for all forms, and yet fitted with none, the <hi>Mundus vitae,</hi> (or <hi>world of Lives and Forms</hi>) being every where present so as it is, this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute widow, or marriageable Virgin could be no more kept from being match'd with one Form or other, then <hi>Danae</hi> could be from <hi>Jupiter,</hi> who notwithstanding the close custody she was under, descended into her lap in a golden shower. Wherefore I conclude, that it is not any certain Experience, but rash juvenilitie and confidence, that makes thee pronounce thou hast seen and felt the <hi>first Matter.</hi>

Therefore that which continues the same <hi>nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mericall</hi> substance, though in its notion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complete, and sustains the succeeding form, that is a thing in Nature.

                     <p>Secondly, That following this Rule, we shall find the Extent of the World to be bounded no higher then the clouds, or there about: So that the Firmament, viz. the Air, (for the <hi>Hebrews</hi> have no word for the Air, distinct from Heaven or Firmament, <hi>Moses</hi> making no distinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) may be an adequate bar betwixt the lower and upper waters. Which it was requisite for <hi>Moses</hi> to mention, vulgar observation discovering that waters came down from above, <hi>viz.</hi> showers of Rain, and they could not possibly conceive, that unlesse
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:99981:56"/>
there were waters above, that any water should descend thence. And this was it that gave occasion to <hi>Moses,</hi> of mentioning those two waters, the one above, the other beneath the firmament.</p>
                     <p>But to return to the first point to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. That Scripture speaks according to the outward appearance of things to sense, and vulgar conceit of men. This I say is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed truth with the most learned of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews.</hi> Amongst whom it is a rule for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of many and many places of Scripture. <hi>Loquitur Lex secundùm linguam fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liorum hominum,</hi> that is, <hi>That the Law speaks according to the language of the sonnes of men:</hi> as <hi>Moses Aegyptius</hi> can tell you. And it will be worth our labour now to instance in some few passages.</p>
                     <p>Gen. 19. V. 23. <hi>The sunne was risen upon the Earth when Lot entred into Zoar.</hi> Which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, that it was before under the Earth: Which is true onely according to sense, and vulgar phansie.</p>
                     <p>Deuteronom. 30. V. 4. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> or <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, Implies that the earth is bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:99981:57"/>
at certain places as if there were truly an <hi>Hercules</hi> Pillar, or <hi>Non plus ultrá.</hi> As it is manifest to them, that understand but the naturall signification of <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. For those words plainly import the Earth bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the blue Heavens, and the Heavens bounded by the Horizon of the Earth: they touching one another mutually. Which is true onely to sense and in appearance, as any man that is not a meer Idiot will confesse.</p>
                     <p>Ecclesiastic. cap. 27. V. 12. <hi>The discourse of a godly man is alwayes with wisdome, but a fool changeth as the moon.</hi> That's to be understood according to sense and appearance. For if a fool changeth no more then the Moon doth really, he is a wise and excellently accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished man, <hi>Semper idem,</hi> though to the sight of the vulgar different. For at least an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misphear of the Moon is alwayes enlightned, and even then most when she least appears to us.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto may be referr'd also that, 2. Chron. 4.2. <hi>Also he made a molten Sea of ten Cubits from brim to brim round in compasse, and five Cubits the heigth thereof, and a line of thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:99981:57"/>
Cubits did compasse it round about.</hi> A thing plainly impossible that the Diameter should be ten Cubits and the Circumference but thirty. But it pleaseth the Spirit of God here to speak according to the common use and opinion of Men, and not according to the subtilty of <hi>Archimedes</hi> his demonstration.</p>
                     <p>Again Psalme 19. <hi>In them hath he set a tabernacle for the Sunne, which as a bridegroom cometh out of his chamber, and rejoyceth as a strong man to runne his race.</hi> This, as M. <hi>John Calvin</hi> observes, is spoken according to the rude apprehension of the Vulgar, whom <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> should in vain have indeavoured to teach the mysteries of Astronomy. <hi>Haec ratio est.</hi> (saith he) <hi>cur dicat tentorium ei paratum esse, deinde egredi ipsum ab una coeli extremitate, &amp; transire celeriter ad partem oppositam; Neque enim argutè inter Philosophos de integro solis circuitu disputat, sed rudissimis quibusque se ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodans, intra ocularem experientiam se continet; ideóque dimidiam cursûs partem que sub Hemisphaerio nastro non cernitur,</hi> subticet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i. e. <hi>This is the reason, to wit, the rudenesse of the vulgar, why the Psalmist saith there is a tent
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:99981:58"/>
prepared for the Sunne, and then that he goes from one end of the heaven and passes swiftly to the other: For he doth not here subtily dispute amongst the Philosophers of the intire circuit of the Sunne, but accommodating himself to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of every ignorant man, contains himself within ocular experience; and therefore saith no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the other part of the course of the sunne, which is not to be seen as being under our He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misphear.</hi> Thus M. Calvin.</p>
                     <p>I'le adde but one instance more, <hi>Joshuah</hi> 10 V. 12. <hi>Sunne stand thou still upon Gibeon, and thou Moon in the Valley of Ajalon.</hi> Where it is manifest that <hi>Joshuah</hi> speaks not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Astronomicall truth of the thing, but according to sense and appearance. For suppose the Sunne placed and the Moon at the best advantage you can, so that they leave not their naturall course, they were so farre from being one over <hi>Ajalon</hi> and the other over <hi>Gibeon,</hi> that they were in very truth many hundreds of miles distant from them. And if the Sun and Moon were on the other side of the <hi>Equatour</hi> the distance might amount to thousands.</p>
                     <pb n="113" facs="tcp:99981:58"/>
                     <p>I might adjoyn to these proofs the suffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of many Fathers and Modern Divines, as <hi>Chrysostome, Ambrose, Augustine, Bernard, Aquinas,</hi> &amp;c. But 'tis already manifest enough that the Scripture speaks not according to the exact curiosity of truth, describing things <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, according to the very nature and essence of them; but <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, according to their appearance in sense, and the vulgar opinion of men. Nor doth it therefore fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that such expressions are false, because they are according to the appearance of things to sense and obvious phansie, for there is also a Truth of Appearance.</p>
                     <p>And thus having made good the first part of my promise, I proceed to the second; Which was to shew that the Extent of the world is to be bounded no higher then to the clouds, or thereabouts, that it may thence appear, that the upper waters mentioned in <hi>Moses,</hi> are the same with those <hi>Aquae in coelo stantes</hi> mentioned by <hi>Pliny, lib.</hi> 31. his words are these, <hi>Quid esse mirabilius potest aquis in coelo stantibus?</hi> and these waters can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else, but that contain'd in the clouds,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:99981:59"/>
which descends in rain; and so the whole Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation will be contain'd within the compasse of the Aire, which the Hebrews call <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        </gap> 
                        <hi>ibi aquae:</hi> because it is <hi>sedes nubium,</hi> the place of clouds and rain. And that the world is extended no higher then thus, according to Scripture, it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. First, because the clouds are made the place of Gods abode; whence we are to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose them plac'd with the Highest. There he lives, and runns, and rides, and walks. <hi>He came walking upon the wings of the wind,</hi> in the 104 Psalm. <hi>Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters, who maketh the clouds his chariot, and walketh on the wings of the wind.</hi> Laieth the beams of His chambers in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, to wit, the upper waters which are the clouds. The Almighties lodgings therefore according to the letter, are placed in the clouds. There about also is his field for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise and warre, Deut. 33.26. <hi>There is none like to the God of Jeshurun, who rideth upon the Heavens for thy help in his excellency on the sky,</hi> that is, upon the upper clouds, as <hi>Buxtorf</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprets it, and indeed what can <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:99981:59"/>
signifie above, but clouds? for below it signifies <hi>pulvis tenuissimus, small dust;</hi> and the clouds are as it were the dust of heaven. <hi>Vatablus</hi> also interprets that place of Gods riding on the clouds. And this agrees well with that of <hi>Nahum,</hi> chap. 1. V. 3. <hi>The Lord hath his way in the whirlwind, and the clouds are the dust of his feet.</hi> Here he is running as swift as a whirlwind, and raiseth a dust of clouds about him. You shall find him riding again, <hi>Psalme</hi> 68.4. and that in triumph; but yet but on the clouds: sutably to that in <hi>Deut. Sing unto God, sing praises unto his Name, extoll him that rideth upon the heavens by his name J A H, and rejoyce before Him.</hi> That rideth upon the Heavens; the Hebrew is <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, which I would be bold with <hi>Aben Ezraes</hi> leave, to translate, <hi>that rideth upon the clouds:</hi> For clouds cause darknesse, and the root from whence <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        </gap>, which si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifies <hi>obtenebrari, obscurari.</hi> But for the ground of this Rabbies interpretation, to wit, <hi>upon the heavens,</hi> it is taken out of the 33 verse of the 68 <hi>Psalme, To him that rideth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the heaven of heavens of old.</hi> But if we
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:99981:60"/>
read on there, we shall find that those heavens of heavens, in all probability, reach no higher then the clouds. For let's read the whole verse together, <hi>To him that rideth upon the heaven of heavens that were of old; Lo, he doth send out his voice, and that a mighty voice:</hi> what's that but thunder? and whence is thunder but out of the clouds? and where then doth God ride but on the clouds? The following verse makes all plain: <hi>Ascribe ye strength unto God; His excellency is over Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, and his strength is in the clouds:</hi> which doth notably confirm, that the Extent of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, according to the letter of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>David</hi> too, are but about the height of the clouds. For here the heaven of heavens is the seat of thunder, and Gods strength and power is said to be in the clouds. Nor doth this expression of this height, to wit, <hi>the heaven of heavens of old,</hi> imply any distance higher. For sith all the Firmament from the lower to the upper waters is called Heaven; it is not a whit unreasonable that the highest part of this Heaven or Firmament, be called the Heaven of Heavens. And this is my first
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:99981:60"/>
argument that the heaven or firmaments Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent is but from the Sea to the Clouds, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God is seated no higher in the outward phrase of Scripture.</p>
                     <p>My second argument is taken from the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning the <hi>heavens</hi> with the <hi>clouds</hi> exegeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, one with another, for the setting out of that which is exceeding high, as high as we can expresse. And this the Psalmist doth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, <hi>Psalme</hi> 36.5. <hi>Thy mercy, O Lord, is in the Heavens, and thy faithfulnesse reacheth unto the Clouds.</hi> And <hi>Psalme</hi> 57.10. <hi>For thy mercy is great unto the Heavens, and thy truth unto the Clouds.</hi> And <hi>Psalme</hi> 108.4. <hi>For thy mercy is great above the Heavens, and thy truth reacheth above the Clouds.</hi> Where heaven and clouds set off one and the same height, that which is exceeding high, the mercie and truth of God.</p>
                     <p>My last argument is from the Psalmists placing the Sunne, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>in the clouds,</hi> or <hi>in the cloudy heaven.</hi> For the word must so si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifie as I did above prove, both from Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony, and might also from the Etymon of the word. For <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> signifies <hi>comminuere,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:99981:61"/>
contundere, to beat to dust:</hi> and what are clouds but the dust of heaven, as I may so speak. <hi>Psalme</hi> 89. <hi>v.</hi> 36, 37. <hi>His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the Sunne before me. It shall be established for ever as the Moon, and as the faithfull witnesse <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> in heaven:</hi> that is, in the sky, the place where the clouds are. The drawing down therefore of the Sunne, that faithfull witnesse in heaven, so low as the clouds, implies that the letter of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture takes no notice of any considerable part of the firmament above the clouds, it termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating its expressions alwayes at that Extent. And this sutes very well with <hi>Moses</hi> his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Sun and the Moon the <hi>great lights,</hi> and making nothing as it were of the starres, as is manifest out of the 16 verse of the first of <hi>Genesis. And God made two great lights, the greater light to rule the day, and the lesse to rule the night; He made the starres also.</hi> But they come as cast into the bargain, as not so consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, when as indeed a star of the first ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnitude is (according to the calculation of the Astronomers) twenty thousand times bigger then the earth, and the earth five and fourty
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:99981:61"/>
times bigger then the Moon; so that one star of the first magnitude will prove about nine hundred thousand times bigger then the Moon. Which notwithstanding, according to the letter of <hi>Moses,</hi> is one of the two great lights, the sole Empresse of the night. But here the letter of <hi>Moses</hi> is very consistent with it self. For sith that the Extent of heaven is not acknowledged any higher then the clouds, or thereabout (wherein as I shewed you, the Sun is, and consequently the Moon, and it will not be more harsh ro make the starres stoop so low too; nay, they must indeed of necessitie all of them be so low, they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no where else to be higher, according to the usuall phrase of Scripture, the appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the starres will then to our sight suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently set out their proportions one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Sun and the Moon (according to this Hypothesis) will prove the two great lights, and the starres but scatter'd sky-peb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. Wherefore from all this harmony and correspondencie of things, I think I may safely conclude, that the Extent of the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament according to <hi>Moses,</hi> is but the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:99981:62"/>
from the sea to the clouds, or there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts, as well as it is to our sight, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not discern any intervall of altitudes betwixt the clouds and the Moon, the Moon and the Sunne, and lastly betwixt the Sunne and the fixed Stars. Which interpretation I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent any man will admit of, that can bring down the tumour of his Philosophick phansy unto a vulgar consistencie and fit compliance with the sweetnesse and simplicity of <hi>Moses</hi> his style.</p>
                     <p>And thus, <hi>Philalethes,</hi> have I proved that there is no room for thy interstellar waters within the compasse of <hi>Moses</hi> his Creation, unlesse they run into one, and mingle with the rain or clouds.</p>

And if we could find any Nonsense sublunary to paralell it, it would be some such stuff as this: Although the cannon bullets in the tower be as bigge as mount <hi>Athos,</hi> yet they are so little that they
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:99981:63"/>
will not fill the compasse of a walnut. This is a bundle of falsities and so is that. That is, Both the parts of these compound Axioms are false, and the composition it self also ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate. These are <hi>Discrete</hi> Axioms, <hi>Euge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> and both the parts ought to be true, but they are both false here. And there ought also, especially these notes <hi>Quamvis</hi> and <hi>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> being in them, to be onely a <hi>Discretion</hi> of parts, but here is an implacable Opposition: things put together that imply a contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. In the latter of these Axioms it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, but I will shew you, it is so also, in that former of yours.</p>
                     <p>For first, the <hi>Epicycles</hi> of <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> are not too bigge to be true. For they do not sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose them bigger then will be conteined, within the thicknesse of their own orbs. And you your self say that they are but as mites in a cheese in respect of their orbs. So that it is plain according to what you your self grant, as well as according to the <hi>Hypothesis</hi> of <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> that they are not too bigge to be true.</p>
                     <p>But secondly, I say they are not as little as
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:99981:64"/>
Mites in respect of the cheese they are in. For the semi-diameter of <hi>Saturns Epicycle</hi> is to the semi-diameter of his Eccentrick, at least as 1 to 10. and the semi-diameter of <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Epicycle</hi> to the semi-diameter of his Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centrick more then as 1 to 6. but <hi>Mars</hi> his, as 2 to 3, or thereabout, and the semidiame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Epicycle of <hi>Venus,</hi> to the semidia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter of her eccentrick more then as 2 to 3 by a good deal. And is it not plain hence <hi>Eugenius,</hi> that thy mite in a cheese must swell up at least to the bignesse of a Mouse in a cheese, though thy cheese were almost as little as a trundle bed wheel, or a box of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malade: and what a vast difference is there betwixt a Mite and a Mouse, but thy igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance emboldens thee to speak any thing.</p>
                     <p>But now in the last place, the putting these two falsities together is contradiction, as well as they are severally false. For it is evident, that if the <hi>Epicycles</hi> be too bigge to be true, they cannot be so little as Mites in a cheese, in respect of their orbs. For then would they be easily contain'd within the <hi>crassities</hi> or thicknesse of their orbs. But their not being
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:99981:64"/>
able to be conteined within the <hi>Crassities</hi> of their orbs, that's the thing that must make them too bigge to be true.</p>
                     <p>And questionlesse if we will joyn the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cycle</hi> with its right office, which is to bring down the Planet to its lowest <hi>Perigee,</hi> then the <hi>Epicycles</hi> of the planets will be too bigge to be true. For there will be of them that are half as big again as their <hi>Deiferents,</hi> nay five times if not ten times as big. And of these <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cycles</hi> I said (and <hi>Ptolemies</hi> ought to have been such, unlesse they did desert their office) that they were too bigge to be true. But thou pronouncest concerning these things thou knowst not what, and therefore art easily tost up and down like a shittle cock thou knowst not whither. How do I blow thee about as the dust or the down of thistles?</p>

Therefore if that large expansion of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens lay within the compasse of the Masse, that matter occupyed the same space that the masse did, and so dimensions lay in dimensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and thus that which is impenetrable was penetrated, which is a contradiicton.

                        <hi>Bid adiew to thy reputation Mastix.</hi> Well, now I perceive that thou thinkest that thou hast hit the nail on the head indeed. But all that thou dost or canst collect from what is in my Preface to the Canto <hi>concerning the sleep of the Soul,</hi> is but this: that whether we see or imagine that both of these are but the very <hi>Energie</hi> of the Soul, and that the Soul doth not nor can perceive any thing imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately but her own <hi>Energie.</hi> But what of all this? It doth not thence follow that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward &amp; outward sense is all one, but only <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate genericâ,</hi> no more then if I should say, that to be an <hi>Animal</hi> is but to have corporeal sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, life and sense, it would thence follow that an horse and a man are all one. Look
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:99981:73"/>
thee now, <hi>Magicus,</hi> how I have passed through this huge Mound and Bulwark of thine, with as much ease and stilnesse as a gliding Spirit through a Mud-wall. I will onely look back and laugh at thee <hi>Magicus,</hi> for a man of no Logick. But if any man doubt whether thou saist blind men see in their sleep, it is apparent that thou doest. For in thy <hi>Anthroposophia, Page</hi> 40. <hi>line</hi> 1. thou saist, <hi>That the visible power is not destroyd as is plain in the dreams of blind men.</hi> Here if thou knowst what thou saist, thou arguest from the effect to the cause, from the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the faculty, but is the operation of the <hi>Visive</hi> faculty (for thou dost barbarously call it <hi>visible</hi>) any thing else but seeing? there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou dost plainly assert that blind men see in their sleep. It would be well if they could walk in their sleep too: for then they would scarce have any losse of their eyes.</p>

                     <p>What a pitifull account dost thou give me here of the difficulties I urged thee with. My Queres were these, You making two spirits in a man the Rationall and Sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. First, <hi>Whether the Rationall Spirit doth not hear and see in a man?</hi> Here you distinguish. The Sensitive Spirit sees the <hi>Object</hi> (say you) and the Rationall the <hi>Species.</hi> But I say unto thee, that sensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is nothing else, but the perceiving of some present corporeall object; and that the ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall soul doth. For when two men discourse, that in them that reasons, hears the words, and sees the party with whom it reasoneth, does it not? Therefore they both see the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: But you will say, One sees by a <hi>species,</hi> the other without. I say nothing can be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned without a <hi>species,</hi> that is, without an actuall representation of the thing discerned.
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:99981:74"/>
So that that distinction is in vain. And I would adde this further, That every <hi>sentient spirit</hi> must perceive by its own <hi>species,</hi> and not by anothers. But thou sayest, This sensitive Spirit like a glasse represents the <hi>species</hi> of externall objects. Then it seems the Sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive spirits office is to be the glasses of the soul to see things in, but glasses themselves, <hi>Magicus,</hi> are not <hi>sentient,</hi> nor need this Spirit be so, that is the souls glasse; and it is plain it is not. For if these two were two different sensitive spirits, then they would have two different <hi>Animadversions;</hi> but there is but one <hi>animadversive</hi> spirit in a man, and therefore but one Sensitive. And that there is but one <hi>animadversive</hi> spirit in a Man is plain from hence, that if the Rationall <hi>animadversive</hi> bestow its animadversion fully elsewhere, the Sensitive in man cannot perform the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sandth part of that which is performed in brutes. We should loose our selves in the most triviall matters, when notwithstanding this sensitive spirit in man, would have as quick a vehicle as in most brutes. Besides, this sensitive spirit having this animadversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:99981:75"/>
would have also a Memory apart, and would be able while the Rationall is busied about something else, to lay up observations such as beasts do by it self; and then long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to shew them to the Rationall, to its sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den amazement and astonishment. But none of these things are. And in my apprehension it is, in a very grosse and palpable way, sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to me, that there is but one <hi>Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive</hi> in me, and I think I am no monster; If I be, it is (it seems) in that I am all rationall spirit, and have had the luck to misse of the sensitive, the beast.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Page 77. line 3. If this be true, then there be two hearing and seeing souls in a man.</hi> This is my second Quere; I ask'd if there be. To this you answer, Ha ha he! A very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found answer. This is no laughing matter, my friend. Have I not already shew'd you some difficulties, this asserting two sensitive Spirits in a man, is laden with? Answer them, <hi>Phil.</hi> I should gladly heare thee use thy tongue as well as see thee shew thy teeth by laughing. For that slender faint reason that follows thy loud laughing, <hi>viz.</hi> The objects
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:99981:75"/>
are different and the senses are different, that is taken away already. For the sting of my Argument is not this, that there would be two sensitive souls of the same nature in the body of a man; but that there should be two sensitive souls at all. And indeed, consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the superiour soul contains the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the inferiour, it is altogether needlesse. And that is a very sober truth, <hi>Entia non sunt multiplicanda sine necessitate.</hi> Which is to the same sense with that so often repeated in <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi> and <hi>Theophrastus,</hi>

                        <hi>God and Nature do nothing in vain.</hi> And the right organization of parts and due tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the body, and proportion of <hi>animal</hi> spirits, this is all the glasse the soul of man wants in this life, to see by or receive <hi>species</hi> from.

                        <hi>Line</hi> 10. <hi>I could, Mastix, teach thee an higher truth.</hi> Yes truly, <hi>Magicus,</hi> you are best of all at those truths which dwell in the Highest. You love to soar aloft out of the ken of sense and reason, that you may securely Raunt it

Thirdly, and lastly, the soul is still the same individuall soul; but the flame is no more the same flame, then the water betwixt such and such banks of the river, is still the same wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

I could very willingly grant thee a mere body without a soul, thou hast so little reason and sense in thee; or if thou hast a soul, that it is a corporeall one, and it may well be so: but my question is meant of souls that have Sense and Reason in them, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be corporeall substances or no? Yes, say you, they are. They are <hi>intelligent Fire and Light.</hi> I say, <hi>Phil.</hi> thou art all fire, but no light, nor intelligent at all. Thou art the hottest fellow that ever I met with in all my dayes, as hot as a Taylours Goose when it hisseth, and yet as dark. But let's endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:99981:85"/>
(if it be possible) to vitrifie thy opake carcase, and transmit a little light into thee. Doest thou know then what fire is? how it is a very fluid body, whose particles rest not one by another, but fridge one against ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, being very swiftly and variously agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. In this condition is the matter of fire. But now I demand of thee; Is there any sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in this fire thou speakest of, (for thou sayest it is really fire, and usest no Metaphor) which we may call the essentiall Form there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, or no? If there be, I ask thee whether that Form be Intelligent, or no? If it be, then that is the soul, and this subtile agitated matter is but the vehicle. But if thou wilt say, that the subtile fiery matter it self is the Intelligent Soul, see what inconveniencies thou intanglest thy self in. For fire being as <hi>homogeneall</hi> a body as water is, and having all the parts much what alike agitated; how can this fire do those offices that commonly are attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the soul? First, how can it organize the body into so wise a structure and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivement, the parts of this fire tending as much this way as that way or at least tending
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:99981:86"/>
onely one way, suppose upward. Secondly, how can it inform the whole body of an <hi>Embryo</hi> in the wombe, and of a grown man? For if it was but big enough for the first, it will be too little for the latter; unlesse you sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it to grow, and to be nourished. But thus, you will not have the same Individuall Soul you was Christened with, and must be forced to turn not onely <hi>Independent,</hi> but <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptist,</hi> that your new soul may be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed: for it is not now the same that you was Christened with before. For I say, that ten spoonfulls of water added to one, should ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther individuate the whole, then that one of that whole number should individuate the ten. Thirdly, how can it move it self, or the body in a spontaneous way? For all the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of this fiery matter wriggling and playing on their own centers, or joyntly endeavouring to tend upwards, makes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to a spontaneous motion, no more then the Atomes of dust that are seen playing in the Sunne beams, striking through a chink of a wall into a dark room, can conspire into one spontaneous motion, and go which way they please.</p>

Thou art so young that thou canst not distinguish betwixt a living barn, and a baby made of clouts. But this is not all that I have to say <hi>Phil.</hi> Fourthly, I say that this fire cannot be the Soul, because fire is devoid of sense. I but you say you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand an <hi>Intelligent fire.</hi> Learnedly answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and to as much purpose as if you should say, that a Soul is a Post or a Pillar, and then
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:99981:87"/>
you should distinguish and tell me, you meant an Intelligent Post or Pillar, but I say fire hath no more sense then a Post or Pillar has reason. For if it have sense, it must have that which the Schools call <hi>Sensus communis.</hi> And now tell me <hi>Phil,</hi> to which of all the playing particles of this <hi>Ignis fatuus</hi> of thine thou wilt appoint the office of the <hi>Sensus Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> or why to any one more then to the rest? But if thou appoint all, there will be as many severall sensations, as there are particles. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed so many distinct living things. And thou wilt become more numerous within, then the possessed in the Gospel, whose name was <hi>Legion,</hi> because they were many. But if thou wilt pitch upon any one particle above the rest, tell me where it is? In the middle or at the out-side of this fire? I will interpret thee the most favourably, and answer for thee; In the middle. But I demand of thee, Why shall this in the middle have the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of being the <hi>Sensus Communis</hi> rather then any other, or how will it be able to keep it self in the middle in so fluid a body? And if it were kept there, what priviledge hath it
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:99981:87"/>
but what the most of the rest have, as well as it, to make it fit for the office of a <hi>Sensus Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munis?</hi> For it must be, either because it is otherwise moved on its Center, then the other are on theirs, which you can not prove either to be, or if it were, to be to any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: Or it must be, because it hath some ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage in consideration of the joynt motion of the particles. Let the joynt motion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of the particles be either <hi>rectilinear</hi> or <hi>circular.</hi> If <hi>rectilinear,</hi> as suppose in a square, let the processe of motion be from side to side parallel. Hath not then any particle in a right line that is drawn through the center of this Square figure, parallel to two of the sides, equall advantage for this office (the transmission of outward sense being perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular to the said right line) that the middle particle hath? For thus it can receive but what comes in one line, transmission of sense being parallel as is supposed. Nay, the points of any other inward line parallel to this, will do as well as the points of this middle line, which is as plainly true, as two and two is four, if thou understandest sense when it is
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:99981:88"/>
propounded to thee. Well, but it may be you may think you can mend your self by sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing the joynt motion of this fiery matter to be <hi>circular.</hi> I say no. For then that of this motion, that respects externall objects is from the Center to the Circumference, as it is plain in that ordinary experiment of a Sling. And thus motion is from the middle particle not towards it. But you should say here, if you could answer so wisely, that motion bearing forward from this center toward the object, that reciprocally the object will bear against it; and so there will be a transmission of sense to the center round about from all the circumferentiall parts of this fiery Orb which thou calledst the naked soul. But I say, <hi>Magicus,</hi> if the middle point of this Orb get the place of the <hi>Sensus Communis,</hi> because there is a common transmission of motion from sensible Objects thereunto: I say then that there be more <hi>Sensus Communes</hi> in this Orb then One, because such transmissions as are not perpendicular to this Orb, will meet in severall points distant from the middle point or center of this Orb, and there are
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:99981:88"/>
enough such externall transmissions as these. I might adde also, that the middle point or particle being though a minute one yet a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and consequently divisible, that that will also bid fair for a multiplicity of <hi>Common Senses.</hi> But I will adde onely this, That I hope to see the day wherein thou wilt be so wise as to be able to confesse, that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of <hi>Anthroposophia Theomagica,</hi> &amp;c. was the most confident <hi>Ignaro</hi> that ever wet pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per with ink. But before I leave this fourth argument, let me onely cast in one thing more which equally respects both Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, either of <hi>rectilinear</hi> or <hi>circular</hi> motion. And that's this. If any one particle of this fiery substance, be the <hi>Common sense,</hi> it must be also the principle of spontaneous motion to the whole substance. For we see plainly that that which hath the <hi>Animadversive</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in man, or the office of <hi>Common sense,</hi> moves the whole man, or that the motion of him is directed, at the beck of this. But I prethee <hi>Phil,</hi> tell me if thou canst possibly imagine, that any one particle in this fiery substance should be able to impresse sponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:99981:89"/>
Motion upon the whole. I know thou canst not but think it impossible. Fifthly, If the soul be fire (fire being so fluid and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steddy a substance) how can there be any me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory in it? You remember that experssion in <hi>Catullus,</hi> whereby he would set forth sudden obliteration &amp; forgetfulness of things, that it is like writing in the Water or in the Aire.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>In vento aut rapidâ scribere oportet aquâ.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But what think you of fire then, will that consistency bear more durable characters? The perpetuall fridging and toying of the fiery particles doth forthwith cancell what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is impressed, and now there is neither <hi>Common sense</hi> nor <hi>Memory</hi> to be found in your fire, we may be secure there is no <hi>Reason</hi> to be found there. For the Discursive Faculty requires some <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, something fixt to tread upon as well as the Progressive. But in your fire all is aflote, nothing fixt. Sixthly and lastly, If the Soul of man be either fire or aire, or both, I do not see that it will prove <hi>immortall;</hi> but that its consistency will be dispersed and scattered like the clouds. It will not be able to conflict with the boistrous
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:99981:89"/>
winds, or scape blowing out, or being lost in the thinne aire, as other flames are, it once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uncased of the armature of the body. And these Vehicles which you will have to be the very Soul it self, they being so change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and passive within the body, it will not be absurd with <hi>Lucretius</hi> to inferre that they will be utterly dissolved when they are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out.</p>

                        <p>But now I have so fully confuted thy
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:99981:90"/>
grosse opinion of the Soul, it may be happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expected that I would declare mine own. But <hi>Phil,</hi> I onely will declare so much, that I do not look on the Soul as a <hi>Peripateticall atome,</hi> but as on a spirituall substance, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out corporeall dimensions, but not destitute of an immateriall amplitude of Essence, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latable and contractible.

                        <p>Secondly, That he would work he knew not what, nor wherefore, and that therefore all Generations would be blind Casualties.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, There would not be that Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, infallibility of Action nor proportion and Symmetry of parts in the work.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly and Lastly, That there would be no End nor Impulsive cause to make him to work.</p>
                        <p>To all these unsound Reasons, I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready answered very solidly and truly. That the force of them reached no further then thus. That the <hi>Ratio Seminalis</hi> must at least proceed from something that is knowing, and be in some sense Rationall, but not have reason and animadversion in it self. And this is the opinion of <hi>Plotinus, Marsilius Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinus,</hi> and all the Platonists that I have met with. <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                           <hi>&amp;c. Ennead.</hi> 2. <hi>lib.</hi> 3. To this sense. <hi>For the</hi> Ratio Seminalis <hi>acts in the Matter and that which acts thus naturally, neither understands nor sees, but hath onely a power to transform the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:99981:92"/>
Matter, not knowing any thing but making one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as it were a form or shape in the water.</hi> And <hi>Ficinus</hi> compares this <hi>Ratio Seminalis,</hi> to an Artifice cut off from the mind of the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer and made self-subsistent, and able to work upon prepared matter, but without knowledge, as being disjoyned from all ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madversive essence. This is the right notion of the <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>. And this fully takes away the force of all your Arguments. For these being <hi>divine art</hi> imbodied in Nature and Matter, and working naturally, they will</p>
                        <p>First, Mistake no more, then a Stone will in its journey downwards, or the Fire in its course upward; which go alwayes right, if no externall obstacle hinder them. And these will work right if the Matter be duly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, Though they work they know not what, yet they work right in virtue of that cause from whence they came, the <hi>divine Intellect:</hi> and their operation is no more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall then the ascent of Fire, and descent of Earth; for it is naturall.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, This third falls in with the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:99981:92"/>
and the same answer will serve both.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, There is an Impulsive cause and End of their working, though unkown to them, yet not unknown to the Authour of them. As in the orderly motion of a Watch, the Spring knows not the end of its Motion, but the Artificer doth. Yet the watch moves, and orderly too, and to a good End. But this fourth falls in also with the second or first. And you see now that they are indeed all fallen to nothing at all. So easily is Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence overcome when unbacked with solid Reason.</p>

ignorance in Logick and Philosophy so far, that I professe I did not suspect thou hadst been any thing neare so weak as I have found thee: but I willingly leave the censure of it to the Judicious.

                        <p>Now for that Ingenuous young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, rhe smartnesse of whose Poetry hath so wrung thee, and vext thy guts, that it hath brought upon thee the <hi>Passio Iliaca,</hi> and made thee so foul mouthed, I will only say so much, <hi>Phil.</hi> and speak within compasse, that he hath more wit and Philosophy in one hair of his head, then thou hast in thy whole noddle. And that his verse was not obedient to my prose; but the Muses were very obsequious to his wit and humour of representing thee such as thou art. And in this onely he was no Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, in that he doth not write Fictions as thou doest in prose. But it seems he hath so paid thee home, that the sense of my gentle strokes are struck out by his quicker lash. For thou sayest I am a good harmlesse sneaking Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servatour,

thy <hi>Alaz.</hi> that is, thy thou knowst not what, but no <hi>Mastix</hi> by no means, but onely one that gave thee a flap with a fox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail.

Why doest thou raise then so mighty Tropheyes upon the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory of so harmlesse and unable an enemie? For as inconsiderable as I am, to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self considerable to the world, he makes a Colosse, a Gyant, a Monster of nine acres long of me.

But why into a box with wire grates, rather then into an iron cage, as <hi>Tamberlain</hi> us'd <hi>Bajazeth,</hi> and so carried him up and down in triumph? I wonder thou didst not take this jest by the Turkish Mustachoes, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then that.

I will not abuse my liberty to excesse, onely let me in some way answer the expectation of those that may happily expect my censure of thy <hi>Magia Adamica.</hi> But I shall not so much answer it, as frustrate it: for I professe, I take no pleasure in the censuring of any mans writings; I can imploy my self better. I was in a very merry frolick when I ventur'd upon this; yet the Judicious may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern that there was sobriety enough at the bottome of all that mirth. But as for this <hi>Magia Adamica,</hi> I confesse I have not read it; but I do favourably conjecture, that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour thereof is as well skilled in those books of Magick that <hi>Adam</hi> read by the fire-side in winter nights, while <hi>Eve</hi> held to him the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, as any young man is in these <hi>European</hi> parts.

And thus have I approv'd my self wise as
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:99981:97"/>
                           <hi>Apollonius,</hi> in discovering imposture; and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant as <hi>Hercules,</hi> who over-mastered that <gap reason="foreign">

                        </p>
                        <p>And now, O men of <hi>Ephesus!</hi> I mean all you that reap the fruit of this noble exploit of mine, rear me up my deserved Trophey, and inscribe this <hi>Tetrastich</hi> upon it, for an everlasting monument of your gratitude to me, and love to the truth:</p>
                        <lg>
                           <l>Religious Heat as yet unpurged quite</l>
                           <l>From fleshly sense and self, when't makes a stir</l>
                           <l>About high Myst'ries above Reasons light,</l>
                           <l>Is at the bottome but a <hi>rabid curre.</hi>
                           </l>
                        </lg>
                        <p>But that I may conceal nothing from you, O men of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> I must tell you, that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you rear up this monument, or whether you forbear, all is one. For the truth of these verses is already written in the corner stones of the Universe, and engraven on the lasting pillars of Eternity. Heaven and earth may passe away, but not one tittle of this truth shall passe away. High and windy Notions do but blow up and kindle more fiercely the fire of Hell in the hearts of men. From
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:99981:97"/>
whence is Pride, and Contention, and bitter Zeal. This is the pest and plague of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and the succeeding torture of the sons of <hi>Adam.</hi> For while the mind of man catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth at high things, of which she is uncapable till she be refined and purged, she doth but fire the frame of her little world by her over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busie Motion, which burning in grosse fewel, fills all with smoke. And thus the soul is even smothered and stifled in her narrow mansion. Her first enlargement here must therefore be, by Temperance and Abstemiousnesse: For without this breathing-hole for fresh aire, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion it self will choak her still more and more, heating her thick and polluted spirits in such sort, that they cannot be sufficiently rectified by the power of the brain. But in this <hi>Dispensation</hi> especially is lodged a strong voice, weak sense, and a rude contempt of any thing that will trouble the head, as Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, Philosophy, or any but ordinary subtilty in learning. But they love Christ very hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily after their grosse way, as their Protectour and Securer from what outward evil natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally attends so bad an inward condition. But
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:99981:98"/>
being so immersed in brutish sense, and yet with conscience of sinne; if any body have but the trick to perswade them that sinne is but a name, he will be a very welcome A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle to them, and they will find more ease to their beastly nature, in phansying nothing to be sinne, then they did in making their Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriticall addresses to an offended Saviour. And then (poore souls) through the foulnesse of the flesh, are they easily inveigled into A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theisme it self. In so great danger are we of the most mischievous miscarriages, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning of those known and confessed ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of Temperance, Continence, and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stity.</p>
                        <p>But we'le suppose Men in a great measure <hi>temperate;</hi> yet how farre off are they still from reall happinesse in themselves, or from not disturbing the happinesse of others, so long as Envy, Ambition, Covetousnesse, and Self-respect doth still lodge in them? Here indeed Reason may happily get a little more elbow-room; but it will be but to be Patron to those vices, and to make good by Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment harsh opinions of God, and perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:99981:98"/>
to conclude the power of Christ weaker then the force of sinne. And the Phansie in these something more refined Spirits, will be more easily figurable into various conceits, but very little to the purpose. Of which some must go for sober Truths, and those that are more fully shining, in the midst of a shadowy Melancholiz'd imagination, must bid fair for Divine Inspiration, though neither Miracle nor Reason countenance them. But you, O men of <hi>Ephesus!</hi> if any one tell you strange devises, and forbid you the use of your Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, or the demanding of a Miracle, you will be so wise as to look upon him as one that would bid you wink with your eyes, that he might the more easily give you a box of the Eare, or put his hand into your Pockets.</p>
                        <p>Now out of this second <hi>Dispensation,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable swarms of Sects rise in all the world. For Falsehood and Imagination is infinite; but Truth is one. And the benignitie of the Divine Spirit, having no harbour in all this varietie of religious Pageantry; Envy, Covetousnesse, and Ambition must needs make them bustle, and tear all the world in
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:99981:99"/>
pieces, if the hand of Providence did not hold them in some limits:</p>
                        <q>Quin laniant mundum; tanta est discordia fratrum:</q>
                        <p>as he saith of the winds. In this <hi>Dispensation</hi> lodgeth Anger and active Zeal concerning Opinions and Ceremonies, Uncertainty and Anxietie touching the purposes of God, and a rigid injudicious Austerity, of which little comes but the frighting men off from Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: which notwithstanding if it be had in the truth thereof, is the most chearfull and lovely thing in the world. These men having not reached to the Second Covenant, will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so thank any body that could release them from the First. For whereas true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is the great joy and delight of them that attain to it, theirs is but their burden. And so it is not impossible that these may be also wound off to the depth of wickednesse, and sink also in time even to Atheisme it self. For what is <hi>reall</hi> in them will work, but what is <hi>imaginary</hi> will prove it self ineffectuall. Wherefore, is it not farre better for men to busie all their strength in destroying those
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:99981:99"/>
things which are so evidently destructive of humane felicity, then to edge their spirits with fiery notions and strange Phantasmes, which pretend indeed to the semblance of deep mysterious knowledge, and divine spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation; but do nothing hinder but that the <hi>black dog</hi> may be at the bottome, as I said before?</p>
                        <p>But you will ask me, How shall we be rid of the Importunity of the impostures and fooleries of this second Dispensation. But I demand of you, Is there any way imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble but this? <hi>viz.</hi> To adhere to those things that are uncontrovertedly good and true, and to bestow all that zeal, and all that heat, and all that pains for the acquiring of the simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the life of God, that we do in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting our own Interest, or needlesse and doubtfull Opinions. And I think it is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out controversie true to any that are not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate below men, that Temperance is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then Intemperance, Justice then Injustice, Humility then Pride, Love then Hatred, and Mercifulnesse then Crueltie. It is also uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trovertedly true, that God loves his own I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:99981:100"/>
and that the propagation of it is the most true dispreading of his glory, as the Light which is the Image of the Sunne, is the glory of the Sunne. Wherefore it is as plainly true, that God is as well willing, as able to restore this Image in men, that his glory may shine in the world. This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is the true Faith, to beleeve that by the power of God in Christ, we may reach to the <hi>participation of the Divine Nature.</hi> Which is a simple, mild, benigne light, that seeks nothing for it self, as it self; but doth tenderly and cordially endeavour the good of All, and rejoyceth in the good of All, and will assuredly meet them that keep close to what they plainly in their consciences are convinced is the leading to it. And I say, that sober Morality, conscienciously kept to, is like the morning light reflected from the higher clouds, and a certain Prodrome of the Sunne of Righteousnesse it self. But when he is risen above the <hi>Horizon</hi> the same vertues then stream immediately from his visible body, and they are the very <hi>members of Christ</hi> according to the Spirit. And he
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:99981:100"/>
that is come hither, is <hi>a pillar in the Temple of God</hi> for ever and ever; for he hath reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Second Covenant, which he can in no more likelihood break, then lay violent hands on himself to the taking away of his naturall life. Nay, that will be farre more easie then this. For a man may kill himself in a trice, but he cannot extinguish this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine life without long and miserable torture. If this be to be a Puritane, <hi>Eugenius,</hi> I am a Puritane. But I must tell thee, that by how much more a man precisely takes this way, the more <hi>Independent</hi> he will prove. And the pure simplicity of the life of God revealed in <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> will shine with so amiable a lustre in his inward mind, that all the most valuable Opinions that are controverted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst Churches and Sects, will seem no more comely then a fools coat, compared with the uniform Splendour of the Sunne. But if thou meanest by either <hi>Puritane</hi> or <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent,</hi> one in the second Dispensation, I should dissemble in the presence of Heaven, if I should not say I am above them; as I am above all Sects whatsoever as Sects. For I
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:99981:101"/>
am a true and free <hi>Christian;</hi> and what I write and speak is for the Interest of Christ, and in the behalf of the <hi>life of the Lamb</hi> which is contemned. And his Interest is the Interest of the sonnes of men; for he hath no Interest but their good and welfare. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they will not have him to rule, the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the world (by a Divine <hi>Nemesis</hi>) are given up into the hands of Wolves, Foxes, and Lions: <hi>The earth is full of darknesse and cruell habitations.</hi> Wherefore, <hi>Eugenius,</hi> thou doest very unskilfully, in endeavouring to tumble me off from the <hi>Independents,</hi> to cast me amongst the <hi>Puritanes,</hi> as thou callest them. For it is not in thy power to cast me so low as any Sect whatsoever; God hath placed me in a Dispensation above them, and wilt thou throw me down? No, <hi>Eugenius,</hi> I shine upon them both as the Sunne in the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament, who doth not wink on one side, or with-draw his Rayes, but looks openly upon all, imparting warmth and light. Thou hast encountred with a Colosse indeed (though thou callest me so but in sport and scorn) far bigger then that stradling Statue at <hi>Rhodes,</hi>
                           <pb n="199" facs="tcp:99981:101"/>
and that reacheth far higher. And yet no Statue neither, but one that will speak what nothing but Ignorance and Hypocrisie can denie. Wherefore with my feet lightly stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the shoulders of all the Sects of the earth (for I would not tread hard like a statue to hurt them) &amp; with my head stooping down out of the Clouds, I will venture to trie the world with this sober question. Tell me therefore, O all ye Nations, People, &amp; Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reds of the earth, what is the reason that the world is such a stage of misery to the Sonnes of Men? Is it not from hence, that that which should be their great Guidance, their Religion and highest Light of their minds, is but Heat and squabbling about subtile un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain points, and foolish affectation of high mysteries, while the uncontroverted sober truths of Vertue and Piety are neglected, and the simplicity of the life of God despised, as a most contemptible thing. And I had no sooner uttered these words in my mind, but me thought I heard an Answer from all the Quarters of the earth, from East, West, North and South, like the noise of many
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:99981:102"/>
waters, or the voice of Thunder, saying, <hi>Amen. Halelujah.</hi> This is true.</p>
                        <p>Nor is this any vain Enthusiasme, <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lethes,</hi> but the triumph of the Divine Light in my Rationall Spirit, striking out to my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour faculties, my Imagination and Sense. For my head was so filled with the noise, that it felt to me as bound and straitened, as being not able to contain it, and coldnesse &amp; trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling seised upon my flesh. But you will say, All this is but a triviall truth that you are so zealous and triumphant in. But verily, <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genius,</hi> is it not better to be zealous about those things that are plainly true, then those that are either uncertain of false? 'Tis true, what I have said to thy soaring soul may seem contemptible. But if thou once hadst the sight of that Principle from whence it came, thou wouldst be suddenly ashamed of that patched clothing of thy soul, stitch'd up of so many unsutable and heedlesse figurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of thy unpurged phansie, and wouldst endeavour to put on that <hi>simple uniform light.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And now, <hi>Eugenius,</hi> that I find my self in
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:99981:102"/>
an advantageous temper to converse with thee, come a little nearer me, or rather I will come a little nearer to thee. Hitherto I have play'd the part of a personated Enemy with thee, give me leave now to do the office of an open Friend. I perceive there is in you, as you have made it manifest to all the world, an eager desire after Knowledge, and as insa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiable thirst after Fame. Both which are to be reputed farre above that dull and earthly pronenesse of the mind of some men, whose thoughts are bent upon little else but the bed and the board. But I tell thee, that this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of thine being kindled so high in thy me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy complexion, there arise these three inconvenieuces from this inordinate heat.</p>
                        <p>First, thy spirits are so agitated, that thou canst not soberly and cautiously consider the Objects of thy mind, to see what is truly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent, what not; and so thy reason goes much to wrack.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, thy melancholy being so high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heated, it makes thee think confidently thou hast a Phantasme or Idea of a thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to this or that word, when thou hast
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:99981:103"/>
not, which is a kind of inward Phrensie and answers to the seeing of outward apparitions when there is nothing before the sight. Thus art thou defeated in thy designe of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, in divine and naturall things by this distemper.</p>
                        <p>But thirdly, the same untamed heat cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth Boldnesse, Confidence and Pride. And hence ariseth thy Imprudence. For I tell thee, <hi>Eugenius,</hi> there is no such imprudent thing in the world as Pride. Wot'st thou not what the humour of all men is; how they think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves no inconsiderable things in the world? You know the story in <hi>Herodotus,</hi> how when the Greeks had overcome the <hi>Persians</hi> and after it was debated amongst them, to whom the <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> belonged, who should have the honour of being reputed most valiant in that service, every one did acknowledge that next to himself <hi>Themistocles</hi> did best. Wherefore it is plain that he that will not let any man go before him provokes all men. Here there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was thy imprudence, <hi>Eugenius,</hi> that thou wouldst take the <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> to thy self without so much as any debate or asking leave, when
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:99981:103"/>
every <hi>Galenist, Aristotelian, Cartesian,</hi> and <hi>Theosophist,</hi> thinks it belongs to him as much as to thee. Thus hast thou provoked all men against thee, and made ship-wrack of thy fame, as well as fallen short of Learning. But you'le say, why? what would you have me to have done as some others do, who though they be proud, yet put on a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some dresse of Modesty and squeamish Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility? That I tell thee had been indeed something more like Prudence, which thy raised heat could not stoop to, but I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse it had been but a kind of Morall Sneak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. For as the bending down of the upper parts of the body, so that the talnesse of the stature thereof is concealed, is the Sneaking of the body: so to make a mans self more hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble then he is, or lesse high-minded, is the Sneaking of the soul. But the first point of wisdome is to be really humble indeed. For, an humble mind is as still as the night, and as clear as the noon-day. So that it is able with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any impatiency or prejudice to discern all things, and rightly to judge of all things. This Christian temper is so sober, and wise,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:99981:104"/>
that no Imposture can surprize it, nor ever will it hurt it felf by rashnesse and impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency. This is the heir of God, the treasury of all humane divine &amp; naturall knowledge, and the delight and praise of men where ever it appears. But the inseparable companions of haughtinesse, are Ignorance, Shame, and Enmity. But beleeve it, <hi>Eugenius,</hi> as this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Humility is of more worth, so is it of more labour then to find the <hi>Philosophers stone,</hi> or the famous medicine you talk of; I am certain of more consequence by ten thousand times. And methinks now at length through all those waves and rufflings of thy disordered mind, I see something at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome in thee, O <hi>Eugenius,</hi> that begins to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to what I say, that begins to shine and smile, and look upon me as a very pleasant Apostle, sent (not without providence) to toy and sport thee into a more sober temper, and advertise thee of the highest good that the soul of man is capable of; and thou wilt I am confident very suddenly say, and that from thy heart, that <hi>better are the wounds of a friend, then the kisses of an enemy.</hi> Or if
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:99981:104"/>
thou canst not yet phansie him a friend that hath worn the vizard of a foe so long, yet I do not mistrust but that thou wilt be so wise, as, according to <hi>Xenophons</hi> Principle, not onely, not to be hurt, but also to be <hi>profited by thine enemy.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>An enemy indeed is not a thing to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bosomed and embraced, as the <hi>Satyr</hi> would have done the fire when he first saw it, and therefore was forewarned by <hi>Prometheus</hi> to abstain,</p>
                        <q>
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        </q>
                        <p>But in the mean time, that which it would pain or consume may by observing the right laws of using it, receive kindly warmth and vigour from it, and work excellent things in virtue of its heat or light.</p>
                        <p>Did not <hi>Telephus</hi> heal his wound by his enemies spear? And had not <hi>Jason</hi> his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postume cured by that weapon that was meant for his deadly dispatch? You know also the story of <hi>Hiero, Eugenius,</hi> who when his enemy had upbraided him with his stink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing breath, chid his wife when he came home,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:99981:105"/>
because she never had discovered it to him all that time of their living together. But she being very honest and simple, told her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band that she thought all mens breaths smelt so. You see then how much more easie it is, to hear what is true concerning us, of our professed Adversaries, then of our bosome Friends.</p>
                        <p>But methinks I hear thee answer, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a bosome Friend nor an embittered Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my can be competent judges of a mans vices or vertues. For the one would be too favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and the other too severe. What then? wouldst thou have some Third thing, a mean betwixt both, (according to that known A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorisme <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>) whom thou mightest hope would prove an impartiall judge? why, that's I, <hi>Phil.</hi> whom, I dare say thou art con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, to be no friend to thee; and I dare swear I am no enemy. And therefore why should I despair, but that my sitnesse and skill may prove as successefull in allaying of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genius</hi> his tumour, as that unskilfull hand was lucky in lancing <hi>Jasons</hi> impostume.</p>
                        <p>And being once cured, do not then repine,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:99981:105"/>
that there was a time wherein thou wast un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound no more then <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, that he was once so little as to be lodged within the narrow compasse of his mothers wombe; Or <hi>Milo</hi> who at length could lift an ox, that he was once so weak that he could not stirre a lamb.</p>
                        <p>And what think'st thou <hi>Phil.</hi> of <hi>Plato, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedocles, Democritus, Socrates,</hi> and other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found sages of the World, can you imagine that when they had arrived to that pitch of knowledge, that it was any shame or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret to them, that there was once a time when they knew not one letter of the Alpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet. Why then should my <hi>Eugenius</hi> be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, that he was once Childish, Ignorant, Proud and Passionate, when he is well cured of those distempers. We are what we are, and what is past is not, and therefore is not to afflict us. But he that is more anxious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Fame then Vertue, and seeks onely to seem a gallant and invincible thing to the world, when in the mean time his mind is very weak and vulnerable, I know my <hi>Euge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> is so wise, that such a man as this,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:99981:106"/>
will seem as irrationall to him, as if one having by ill chance cut his shinne, he should be lesse solicitous about healing of his legge then mending of his stocken.</p>
