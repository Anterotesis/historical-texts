         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times once a yeare there are in the Land many hundreds, and ſome thouſands of this ſort. 2. When by time they come to be knowne, many do appeare to be carnall, and give no Teſtimony of being Members of Chriſt, and therefore if they ſhould offer themſelves to be Members of Churches the Churches would not ſee Warrant to receive them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Church is the body of Chriſt. 3. Some that are Godly do of their own accord for a time forbeare to offer themſelves, till they be better acquainted with the Church and Miniſtry where they intend to joyne, and with the wayes in which the Churches walke in this Country, and and till they be better informed what are the duties of Church Members. 4. Thoſe that are knowne to be God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, are all admitted in ſome Church or other preſently, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their own deſire, when they offer themſelves thereto: except any have given offence by walking (in any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, in their Converſation) otherwiſe then becomes the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell; and then ſuch are to give ſatisfaction to them to whom they have given offence, by acknowledgeing their offence, and ſhewing repentance for it, and then they are Admitted.</p>

Now a ſeale is not to make a thing that was not, but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme ſomething that was before; and ſo Baptiſme is not that which gives being to the Church, nor to the Covenant, but is for confirmation thereof. To bring in Baptiſme be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Covenant, and before the Church, with whom God makes the Covenant and then to bring in the Church after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, is to make Baptiſme a ſeale unto a Blanke, or to a falſhood. When the Jeſuits of <hi>Rhemes</hi> had ſaid that <hi>Chriſt</hi>
                        <pb n="13" facs="tcp:130517:9"/>
ſent 12 Apoſtles to the Jewes to move them to penance, and ſo by Baptiſme to make them of his Church. And that <hi>Paul</hi> was ſent to the Gentiles to move them alſo to faith and penance, and by Baptiſme to make them of his Church. This ſaying of making men of the Church by Baptiſme, though uttered by them, as it were by the way, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the chiefe ſcope of their diſcourſe, yet ſeemed to Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi> ſo erroneous and unſound, that hee would not let it paſſe without bearing ſpeciall witneſſe againſt the ſame. And therefore in oppoſition thereunto he hath theſe words, and in another Character for more conſpicuouſneſſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That Baptiſme makes not men of the Church, but ſealeth their incorporation into it, hath been declared afore. <hi>Argument</hi> of <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 1. And that Catechiſme which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſaid to be penned by our Reverend Brother Mr. <hi>Ball,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> now with God, giving this for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of Baptiſme, that it is a Sacrament of our ingraft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into Chriſt, communion with him, and entrance into the Church, doth in the Expoſition plainely declare, that when they called Baptiſme a Sacrament of our entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church, they did not meane that Baptiſme made men Members of the Church, but ſignified and ſealed that they were Members afore: The ſeed of Abraham ſay they, <hi>Pag 144. Gal.</hi> 3. 7. or children of Chriſtian Parents are within the Covenant, are Chriſtians and Members of the Church, 1 <hi>Cor. 7. 14. Rom.</hi> 11. 16. Baptiſme therefore doth not make them Chriſtian ſoules, but doth ſolemnly ſignifie and Seale their ingrafting into Chriſt, and that communion which the Members of <hi>Chriſt</hi> have with him their head, and doth confirme, that they are acknowledged Members of the Church, and entred into it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21.</p>
                     <p>3. The Lord hath had his Church when there was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Baptiſme nor circumciſion, and therefore Baptiſme or circumciſion cannot be that which conſtitutes the Church. The Church is one and the ſame in eſſence from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the world to the end thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> A company of People combined together by holy Covenant with God,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:130517:10"/>
and one with another, and this hath been before Baptiſme, and likewiſe before Circumciſion in the dayes of the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arks afore <hi>Abraham.</hi> Yea if Baptiſme now, or Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in former time did make men Members of the Church, then for forty yeares together there was no making Members of the Church, for ſo long circumciſion was diſcontinued, when Baptiſme was not yet inſtituted, <hi>Ioſſ. 5. 2, 3. &amp;c.</hi> And ſo by this meanes all that Generation of the Iſraelites that were not circumciſed till their comming over <hi>Jordan</hi> unto <hi>Gilgall,</hi> ſhould have bin no Members of the Church afore that time of their circumciſion, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Scripture, which as it gives the name and title of a Church to the body of this people, when they were in the Wilderneſſe, <hi>Act.</hi> 7. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>8. (and they were in the Wilderneſſe 40. yeares, in the latter parts of which time there were few left remaining that had beene circumciſed) ſo it witneſſeth that afore this time of their circumciſion they were in covenant with God and his Church, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 10, 11, 12. For that covenant was not made with their Fathers that came out of Egypt, and were circumciſed there, becauſe that generation was conſumed in the Wilderneſſe for their mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring afore this time: but this covenant was made with the children, that as yet were uncircumciſed, and therefore it was not circumciſion that made men Members of the Church.</p>
                     <p>4. Baptiſme hath been Adminiſtred, and no Church nor Members made thereby, and men have been made Members of Churches and not then Baptiſed, but before. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not Baptiſme that makes men Members of the Church, Jeruſalem and all Judea, and all the Region round about Jordan were Baptiſed of <hi>Iohn</hi> confeſsing their ſinnes, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 6. And Chriſt made and Baptiſed more Diſciples then <hi>Iohn, Ioh.</hi> 4. 1. And yet neither Chriſt nor John did make new Churches, nor gather men into them themſelves, both the one and the other living and dying Members of the Jewiſh Church, which was not yet diſſolved, untill up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their rejecting of Chriſt (not onely of his perſon upon
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:130517:10"/>
the croſſe, but of his Goſpel in blaſpheming and perſecut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grace offered them) the two ſtaves of beauty and bands were broken and cut aſſunder, whereby God did breake the Covenant that he had made with that People, and the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood between Juda and Iſrael, that is, he did un church them, <hi>Zach. 11. 10, 11. &amp;c.</hi> to 15. So that here is Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme Adminiſtred by John and Chriſt, and yet men not received thereby into the Church as Members, for they were Members long afore.</p>
                     <p>Againe, when any of thoſe of Jeruſalem, Judea, and the Region round about Jordan, that were Baptiſed of John, or any of thoſe, many more that were Baptiſed of Chriſt, were afterward joyned as Members to thoſe chriſtian Churches in Judea, Samaria, and Galile, <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 31. (As no doubt many of them were) they were not made Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of thoſe Chriſtian Churches by being Baptiſed, for they were Baptiſed long afore by John and Chriſt, ſo that thoſe men were Members of the Jewiſh Church, which was not yet diſſolved, and were Baptiſed afterward. And therefore it was not Baptiſme that made them members, either of the one Church or of the other.</p>
                     <p>5. There are ſundry inconveniences, which for ought we ſee will unavoidably follow, if we ſhall ſay that Baptiſme makes men members of the Church; For firſt, if Baptiſme be that which conſtituts the Church, then Baptiſme may be diſpenced by them that are no Miniſters, for extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Miniſters, as Apoſtles, and ſuch like are now ceaſed; and ordinary Miniſters have no power to diſpence Baptiſme to any, but onely to them that are already members of the Church, ſeeing their Commiſsion and power is limited to the Church, and the flock of God over which the Holy Ghoſt hath made them overſeers, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28. Beſides, the Church is before the Miniſters, ſeeing the power of choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Miniſters is given by Chriſt unto the Church; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if Baptiſme be that which makes the Church, then men muſt be Baptiſed afore there be Miniſters to Baptiſe them, and conſequently without Miniſters.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="16" facs="tcp:130517:11"/>Secondly, if Baptiſme rightly for ſubſtance partaked, doth make men members of the viſible Church, then it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that Papiſts are members of the Church: for they have Baptiſme ſo farre right for ſubſtance, as that it needs not be repeated. But Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> teacheth that this Baptiſme proves not the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> of which all Papiſts are members, to be any true Church of God, and gives ſundry Reaſons for the ſame, in Anſwer to them, that from Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme rightly for ſubſtance Adminiſtred in Popiſh Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, would prove thoſe Aſſemblies to be true Churches: <hi>Expoſit. of Creede,</hi> in the Article, <hi>I believe the holy Catholique Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And ſurely for our parts, we doe not ſee how it will be avoyded, but if Baptiſme made men members of the viſible Church, either Papiſts are members of the viſible Church, and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> of which they are Members, a true viſible Church, or elſe we muſt renounce their Baptiſme as corrupt and falſe, even for the ſubſtance of it; and ſo all ſuch as ſhall be converted from amongſt them, muſt be Baptiſed againe, as not having had the ſubſtance of Baptiſme before: ſuch dangerous conſequences do follow from ſaying, that Baptiſme, rightly for ſubſtance partaked, doth make them that are ſo Baptiſed Members of the viſible Church.</p>
                     <p>If any ſhall ſay, <hi>Though Baptiſme do not make men Members of</hi>

                        <hi>the Church, yet it proves them to be Members as a cauſe, is proved by the effect, or an Antecedent by a conſequent: and therefore all Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed Perſons ſhould be admitted to all Church priviledges as Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, whereever they become.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We Anſwer, that this will not hold neither, but ſuppoſe<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> a man have received Baptiſme as a Member of ſome viſible Church, which ought not to have been Adminiſtred to him, had he not been a member, yet this doth not prove him to be a member ſtill and ſo give him right to all Church Priviledges, though hee do remaine alwaies as a Baptiſed perſon; and the Reaſon is, becauſe his Baptiſme may remain, when his Church fellowſhip may be diſſolved, as that he can have no right to Sacraments thereby: the

And this ſhall ſuffice for Anſwer unto this Point, whether Baptiſme make men
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:130517:12"/>
Members of a viſible Church, which as we conceive, is the ſcope and drift of this Queſtion. Yet before we proceed to make Anſwer to the next, ſomething alſo may be ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning ſome paſſages in your Amplification of this fourth Queſtion. As firſt concerning thoſe words wherein you aske, <hi>Whether they that are Baptiſed have not right,</hi> quoad nos, <hi>to all the priviledges of the viſible Church</hi> (ſo farre as they are otherwiſe fit:) concerning which words we may ſay, 1. That thoſe words of your Parentheſis (<hi>ſo farre as they are otherwiſe fit:</hi>) doe plainely imply, that in your judgement, though one hath received Baptiſme, yet this doth not give him right to the priviledges of the viſible Church, unleſſe other things do concurre to make him fit, wherein we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with you. Now if this be ſo, then this ſeemes to be an Anſwer to that which (as we conceive) is the maine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the Queſtion. For how can it be, that Baptiſme alone ſhould give men right to the priviledges of the Church (as Members thereof, as the Queſtion ſeemes to import) when in the Amplification of it, it is granted, that Perſons Baptiſed have no ſuch right, except other things doe concurre to make them fit: we doe not ſee how theſe things doe ſtand together.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, thoſe words <hi>as farre as they are otherwiſe fit:</hi>) as they ſeeme to imply that which contradicts the maine ſcope of the Queſtion; ſo they are ſo generall and of ſuch a latitude, as that when the Queſtion is Anſwered the Reader is ſtill left at uncertainty: For if ſuch a Parentheſis may be annexed (<hi>ſo farre as men are otherwiſe fit:</hi>) then the like Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion may be applied to many other things beſides Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, and would receive the very ſame Anſwer, as in caſe of Baptiſme it would receive. As for example, if one ſhould aske whether Morall honeſtie or litterall knowledge in the Scriptures, or Hiſtoricall Faith, or the uſe of Reaſon, whether any of theſe doe not give men right to Church priviledges, ſo farre as they are otherwiſe fit? You know the Anſwer would be, Yea. For though none of theſe be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient alone, to give men right to the priviledges of the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:130517:12"/>
Church, yet they are ſuch as they that have them, have right ſo farre as they are otherwiſe fit, and ſo if it were granted that they that have received Baptiſme have right, as you ſay, to all the priviledges of the Church, ſo farre as they are otherwiſe fit: yet as this doth not prove that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme alone doth give men ſuch a right, ſo ſtill it remaines to be conſidered, and more particularly declared, what thoſe other things are that beſides Baptiſme muſt concurre to make one fit; and unleſſe thoſe things be expreſſed in particular, the Queſtion with ſuch a generall Qualification as is here ſet down, may be Anſwered affirmatively, and yet the Reader will be ſtill in the darke, and as much to ſeeke as before.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, thoſe words in the latter end of this Queſtion had need to be further cleared, wherein you aske, <hi>Whether Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed perſons have not right to all the priviledges of the Church,</hi> quoad nos, <hi>untill they be caſt out by Excommunication?</hi> For ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe an open Blaſphemer, a Sabath-breaker, an Adulterer, a Drunkard, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that deſerves to be Excommunicated, be not proceeded againſt according to rule, but be ſuffered to continue in the Church through bribery or other corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the times, would you ſay that ſuch a perſon had right either before God, or <hi>quoad nos</hi> to all the priviledges of the Church, onely becauſe hee is Baptiſed? Surely your words doe import ſo much, unleſſe that Parentheſis (<hi>ſo far as they are otherwiſe fit</hi>) may be any helpe in this caſe. And yet we hope you doubt not but ſuch Doggs and Swine have no right either <hi>quoad nos,</hi> or otherwiſe, to the priviledges of the Church as long as they continue in that State, although they have received Baptiſme, and although through the ſinfull neglect of men they be not caſt out by Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, as they doe deſerve; For if groſſe ſinners have ſuch right to Church priviledges, onely becauſe they are Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, then by what right can the Church caſt them out by Excommunication, as you ſeeme to confeſſe that ſhe may: for can ſhe caſtimen out from ſuch priviledges whereunto they have right? doubtleſſe ſuch proceedings were not
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:130517:13"/>
right, unleſſe the Church have ſuch a Tranſcendent power as the Apoſtles never had, for they could do nothing againſt the truth but for the truth, nor had they any power for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, but for Edification, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 8. 10. Wherefore we dare not ſay ſuch men have right to Church priviledges (<hi>quoad nos</hi>) untill they be actually caſt out, becauſe before they be caſt out, it muſt be cleare to the Church, that they have no ſuch right, or elſe ſhe can have no lawfull Right to caſt them out.</p>
                     <p>1. Infants with us are Admitted Members in and with<note place="margin">
                           <hi>To</hi> 5. &amp; 6.</note> their Parents, ſo as to be Admitted to all Church priviledges of which Infants are capable, as namely to Baptiſme; and therefore when Parents are once Admitted, their Children are thereupon Baptiſed, if they were not Baptiſed afore, as ſometimes it falls out. 2. But whether they ſhould there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon be admitted to all other priviledges when they come to age, without any perſonall profeſsion of Faith, or entring into Church Covenant, is another Queſtion, of which by Reaſon of the Infancy of theſe Churches, we have had no occaſion yet to determine what to judge or practiſe one way or other. 3. But for the preſent this we would ſay; It ſeemes by thoſe words of your Parentheſis (<hi>being otherwiſe fit</hi>) you do acknowledge, that Children of Church Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are not to be admitted to Church priviledges, unleſſe they be fit, wherein we conſent with you as counting it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unſafe, that Idiots, Franticks, or perſons openly ungracious and prophane, ſhould be admitted to the Lords Table, though they were the Children of Church Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and thence we may inferre the neceſſity of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall profeſsion of their faith, when they come to yeares, and taking hold of Church-Covenant, whereby we meane onely a Renewing of Covenant, or a new profeſsing of their Intereſt in Gods Covenant, and walking according to it, when they ſhall be <hi>Adulti:</hi> for otherwiſe we do confeſſe, Children that are borne when their Parents are Church Members, are in Covenant with God even from their
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:130517:13"/>
birth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7. 12. and their Baptiſme did ſeale it to them. But notwithſtanding their Birthright, we conceive there is a neceſsity of their perſonall profeſsion of Faith, and taking hold of Church-Covenant when they come to yeares (though you ſeeme to thinke it not needfull:) for without this it cannot ſo well be diſcerned; what fitneſſe is in them for the Lords Table and other Church priviledges, as by this meanes it might? And inaſmuch as entring into Church-Covenant is nothing elſe but a ſolemne promiſe to the Lord, before him and the Church, to walke in all ſuch wayes as the Goſpel requireth of Church Members, if they ſhall refuſe to make any ſuch promiſe, and ſhall be unable, or unwilling to make any profeſsion of their Faith, when it is required of them, this would be an evidence againſt them, of their unfitneſſe for Church priviledges, inaſmuch as they openly breake that Rule, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 15. Be ready to give a Reaſon of the hope that is in you with meekneſſe and feare. What hope is there that they will examine themſelves when they eat of that Bread and drinke of that Cup, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 28. Who when others do examine them they are unable or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to give Anſwer? Or how ſhall we thinke that they will receive the Lords Supper worthily, or walke as becomes the Goſpel if they do refuſe to profeſſe or promiſe any ſuch matter? Wherefore in this Point we cannot but fully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the practiſe of the Reformed Churches, among whom it is the manner as <hi>Zepporus</hi> writeth, to admit Children that were Baptiſed in their Infancy unto the Lords Table, by publique profeſsion of their Faith, and entring into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, <hi>conſuetum eſt,</hi> ſaith he <hi>ut qui per aetatem, neque Doctrina Catechetica perfectum ad ſacram Coenam primum admittuntur, fidei confeſſionem coram tota Eccleſiâ publicè edant,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Polit. Ecleſ. l. 1. c. 14. p.</hi> 158. that is, The manner is, that they who by reaſon of age and perficiency in the Doctrine of Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſme are firſt Admitted to the Lords Supper, ſhould pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely before the whole Church, make confeſsion of their Faith, being brought forth into the ſight of the Church by their Parents, or them that are inſtead of Parents, at the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:130517:14"/>
appointment of the Miniſter: and likewiſe ſhould promiſe and Covenant by the Grace of God to continue in that faith which they have confeſſed, and to leade their lives accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it: yea and moreover, to ſubject themſelves freely and willingly to the Diſcipline of the Church; theſe words we ſee are full and plaine, that Children are not in thoſe Churches received to the Lords Table without perſonall confeſſion of Faith, and entring into Covenant before.</p>
                     <p>4. But how long Children ſhould be counted under age, and whether Orphans are not to be admitted with their Guardians (which is your ſixt Quaery) we ſhould be willing to heare your judgement therein, as having of our ſelves hitherto had no occaſion to ſearch into thoſe Queſtions; onely this we thinke, that one certaine rule cannot be given for all, whereby to determine how long they are under age, but according as God gives experience and maturity of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall underſtanding, and Spirituall; which he gives ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to ſome then unto others.</p>
                     <p>Such Children whoſe Father and Mother were neither<note place="margin">To 7.</note> of them Believers, and ſanctified, are counted by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle (as it ſeemes to us) not faederally holy, but uncleane, what ever their other Anceſtors have been, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. And therefore we Baptiſe them not. If you can give us a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Anſwer, to take us off from that Scripture, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. which ſeemes to limit this faederall ſanctity or holyneſſe to the Children whoſe next Parents one or both were Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, we ſhould gladly hearken to you therein; but for the preſent, as we believe we ſpeake, and practiſe according to our light. And if we ſhould goe one degree beyond the next Parents, we ſee not but we may goe two, and if two, why not 3. 4 20, 100, or 1000? For where will you ſtop? And if we ſhall admit all Children to Baptiſme, whoſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors within a thouſand Generations have been Believers, as ſome would have us, we might by this Reaſon Baptiſe the Children of <hi>Turkes,</hi> and of all the <hi>Indians,</hi> and <hi>Barbarians</hi> in the Country; for there is none of them but they have

                     <p>We do believe that all Members of Churches ought to be<note place="margin">To 8.</note> Saints, and faithfull in Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Eph. 1. 1. 1 Cor. 1. 2. Col. 1. 2. Phil.</hi> 1. 1. and thereupon we count it our duty to uſe all lawfull and convenient meanes, whereby God may helpe us to diſcerne, whether thoſe that offer themſelves for Church Members, be perſons ſo qualified or no: and therefore firſt we heare them ſpeake concerning the Gift and Grace of Juſtifying Faith in their ſoules, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Gods dealing with them in working it in their hearts: which ſeemes to be your firſt particular in this Quaery. Secondly, we heare them ſpeake what they do believe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Doctrine of Faith, ſo taking a tryall what mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure they have of the good knowledge of the Lord, as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that without knowledge men cannot well Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine themſelves and diſcerne the Lords body, as Church Members ought to doe when they come to the Lords Table. And hereby alſo we would prevent (as the Lord ſhall helpe us) the creeping in of any into the Church that may be infected with corrupt opinions of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minianiſme Familiſme, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or any other dangerous error againſt that faith which was once delivered to the Saints, as knowing how eaſily ſuch men if they were admitted, might infect others, and perhaps deſtroy the Faith of ſome. And this ſeemes to be intended in your ſecond particular. For both theſe we have our warrant as in Generall, from thoſe places which ſhew how Church Members ought to be qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified, that they ought to be Saints, faithfull in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So in ſpeciall from that, <hi>Math. 3. 6. Acts 19 18, &amp; Acts</hi> 8. 37. 38. Where men before they were admitted, made profeſsion of Repentance towards God, and faith to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; for it is expreſſely ſaid, that they confeſſed their ſinnes, they confeſſed and ſhewed their deeds, they profeſſed their faith in Jeſus Chriſt the Sonne
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:130517:15"/>
of God. Thirdly, when this is done, thoſe that by mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of Repentance and Faith are approved; as fit Members for a Church do openly profeſſe their ſubjection to the Goſpel of Chriſt, and to all the Ordinances of God in that Church, where now they joyne as Members, which ſeemes to be your third particular in this Quaerie. The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of particular Churches one from another, as ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and diſtinct Societies, ſeemes to us a neceſſary ground for this practiſe; for without this kinde of Covenanting, we know not how it would be avoyded, but all Churches would be confounded into one, inaſmuch as it is neither Faith, nor intire affection, nor Towne-dwelling, nor fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting the Aſſemblies that can make a man a Member, or diſtinguiſh Church Members from other men: See the Apologie.</p>
                     <p>4. Your fourth particular in this Quaerie is Anſwered in the Anſwer to the ſixt Poſition ſent the laſt yeare: Beſides all theſe, we heare the teſtimony of others, if there be any that can ſpeake of the converſion and Godly converſation of ſuch perſons: which we judge to be a warrantable courſe from <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 26, 27.</p>
                     <p>It is the ſecond of your Quaeries, what things we hold ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary<note place="margin">To 9.</note> to the Being of a true viſible Church in Generall: which being Anſwere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

That we doubt not but of Ancient time there have been many true Churches in <hi>England</hi> conſiſting of right matter, and compacted and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted together by the right forme of an holy Covenant.

of <hi>Tiberius</hi> the Emperor, under whom Chriſt ſuffered; and that <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arin. athea</hi> was ſent of <hi>Philip</hi> the Apoſtle from <hi>France</hi> to <hi>England,</hi> about the yeare of Chriſt 63. and remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>England</hi> all his time, and ſo hee with his fellowes laid the firſt foundation of Chriſtian Faith among the Brittaine people, and other Preachers and Teachers comming after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, confirmed the ſame and increaſed it. Alſo the ſaid Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> reporteth out of <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

Now if the Goſpel and Chriſtian Religion were brought into <hi>England</hi> in the Apoſtles times, and by their meanes, it is like there were Churches planted there of Saints by calling (which is the right matter of Churches) and by way of holy Covenant, as the right form: for that was the manner of Conſtituting Churches in the Apoſtles times, as alſo in the times afore Chriſt, as hath been ſhewed from the Scripture in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie. And the footſteps hereof (though mixed with mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold corruptions that have growne in aftertimes) are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in many places of the Land to this day, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by thoſe 3 Queſtions and Anſwers at Baptiſme. <hi>Abre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuntias? Abrenuntio; Credis? Credo: Spondes? Spondeo: Doſt thou renounce the Devill and all his works? I renounce them all. doſt thou believe in God the Father</hi> &amp;c? <hi>I do believe. Doſt thou pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to walk according to this Faith &amp;c? I do promiſe.</hi> For though it may be they conceived, that men entred into the Church by Baptiſme, yet hereby it appears that their judgment was that, when men entred into the <hi>Church</hi> there ought to be a renouncing of ſin, and believing on <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and an open pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing of theſe things, with a promiſe to walk accordingly.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Though Popiſh Apoſtacy did afterwards for many ages over-ſpread all the Churches in <hi>England</hi> (as in other Countries) yet we believe God ſtill reſerved a rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant according to the Election of Grace amongſt them, for

we are perſwaded that ſuch ſtanding in the Pariſh Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, as this ſecond Propoſition mentions, is not lawfull for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to be continued in. And we hope, you doubt not of the truth of this ſecond Propoſition neither, though we are afraid that many Chriſtians, when it comes to practice, doe ſinfully pollute themſelves by partaking in the Ceremonies, and other corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the prayers, in the Doctrine, and in the Miniſtery remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in ſundry of thoſe Aſſemblies, whom it will bee your part whilſt you live among them faithfully and by all good meanes to inſtruct and teach, and exhort, to ſave themſelves from the corruptions and pollutions of the times and places wherin they live; as well in this particular of Church matters, and Gods Worſhip as in other things: Wherein wee wiſh with all our hearts that our ſelves when time was, had been more watchfull and faithfull to God and the ſoules of his People, then the beſt of us were: The Lord lay not our Ignorance to our charge.</p>

                     <p>3. There is none of the Ordinances of Chriſt, but they are needfull and very profitable in the right uſe of them to the ſoules of his Servants: And therefore they ſhould not be neglected.

The like may be ſaid of <hi>Iob</hi> and of his friends, of whoſe ſalvation we make no queſtion, and yet it is a great queſtion whether they were of any Viſible Church or no, inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the Viſible Church in thoſe times ſeemed to be appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to the Houſe and poſterity of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> of which line &amp; race it cannot eaſily be proved that all theſe men did come, nor that they joined themſelves in Viſible fellowſhip with that Church.

Queſtion ſpeakes of private<note place="margin">To 13.</note> and illiterate perſons into a Church Body combined, wee looke at this as an incongruous expreſſion, if not a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. For a company ſo combined as to make a Church, are not fitly called private, (though they be illiterate in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of humane learning) in as much as a Church or a Church-body, eſpecially in times and places of peace and liberty, is a publike Congregation and ſociety: and the acts of Communion which they have among themſelves (ſuch as is the election and depoſing of Miniſters, whereof the Queſtion makes mention) are not private acts but publike or people-like. Neither are literate or learned men there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore publike, becauſe they are indued with humane lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, unleſſe withall they be called to publike office or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment in Church or Common-wealth: and therefore if illiterate be an <hi>exegeſis</hi> of private, we conceive that <hi>exegeſis</hi> is not good.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, whereas this Queſtion asketh <hi>Whether it be lawfull and convenient that ſuch a company ſhould themſelvs ordinarily exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine elect, ordain and depoſe their owne Miniſters?</hi> if <hi>ordinarily</hi> be as much as <hi>frequently,</hi> we anſwer three things. Firſt, that if one Church doe frequently come to ſuch actions, that is, to take in and put out the ſame men, this is not without ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of much levity and raſhneſſe in the people, or unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe or unworthy walking in the Miniſters, or both; and therefore <hi>ordinar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ly,</hi> that is, <hi>frequent</hi> taking in and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out againe in this manner, is as much as may be to be avoided. Secondly, when ſuch things doe often and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently fall out, it is doubtleſſe a Judgement of God upon ſuch a people to have ſo many changes in their Miniſters; as was that of which it was ſaid, <hi>three ſhepheards have I cut off in one moneth, Zach.</hi> 11. 8. that People ſhould be ſo oft as
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:130517:23"/>
ſheep having no Shepheard; <hi>for the tranſgreſsion of a land many are the Princes thereof, Pro.</hi> 28. 2. So in like ſort for the tranſgreſsions of a Church many are the Miniſters there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; we meane, when they have many Miniſters, by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in and going out of the ſame men, or the removing of ſome and the taking in of others in their roome: for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, it is a bleſsing of God, when a Church is furniſhed with variety of Miniſters at the ſame time, <hi>Acts 13. 1. &amp; 21. 18. Phil.</hi> 1. 1. Thirdly, yet this word (<hi>ordinarily</hi>) doth ſeeme to imply, that in your judgement ſometimes this may be lawfull and convenient to be done; Now upon the ſame ground on which it may be done ſometimes, upon the ſame it may be done at other times, if there be juſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, for the aſsiſtance of the Miniſters of other Churches, of which this Queſtion maketh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if this be onely by way of counſell or advice, we know nothing unlawfull or inconvenient in ſuch aſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, becauſe Churches are as Siſters one to another, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8. 8. And therefore it is our practice in ordination of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, as alſo in removall of them, to have ſuch aſsiſtance. But for authority and power, we know none that Miniſters have properly ſo called in any Congregation or Church, ſave that one, over which the Holy Ghoſt hath made them overſeers: and therefore we thinke it not lawfull nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, when a Church is to ordaine Officers, to call in ſuch aſsiſtance (<hi>viz.</hi> by way of authority or power) of the Miniſters of other Churches.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, we judge it lawfull and convenient that every Church of Chriſt (what ever their humane learning be, whether much or leſſe) ſhould elect and chooſe their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters: God doth not (for ought we know) give this power of calling their owne Miniſters unto ſuch Churches as have many learned men in them, and deny it unto others; but gives it indifferently to every Church, as they are a Church, and ſo to one Church as much as to another. If we thought you doubted whether the power of calling Miniſters were given by Chriſt unto the Church, we might here alledge many Reaſons for it; but this being the conſtant judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

                     <p>Fifthly as for that objection which ſeemes to be implyed in the word <hi>illiterate,</hi> that it ſhould not be lawfull or conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for a body to chooſe their owne Miniſters, becauſe they are illiterate, or want men of humane learning among them, wee further anſwere thereto; firſt, that among us when a company are to be combined into a Church-body, (as you ſpeake) there is uſually one or other among them who doe not want all humane learning but have been train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in Univerſities and uſually have been Miniſters and Preachers of the Word in our native Countrey, and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the godly there; and are here by the company that doe ſo combine intended to be choſen afterwards for Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors or Teachers: and accordingly, after the Church is gathered, are in due time elected and ordained into their places. Secondly, but yet if there were none ſuch among them at their firſt combining and uniting, we doe not ſee how this could hinder them of liberty to chooſe Miniſters to themſelves afterward, when God ſhall ſend any to them that may be fit for the worke; becauſe this is a liberty that Chriſt hath purchaſed for them by his precious bloud, and they that are fit matter to bee combined into a Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body, are not ſo illiterate but they have learned the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the holy Scripture in the fundamentall points thereof; they have learned to know the Lord and their owne hearts, they have learned Chriſt, the need they have of him, and of all the meanes of enjoying him, the worth that is in him, and the happineſſe laid up for them in him: and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:130517:24"/>
therefore they may not be reproached as illiterate or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to chooſe their owne Miniſters: nay, they have the beſt learning, without which all other learning is but mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and folly, and ſcience falſly ſo called, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 20. and indeed of none account with God, nor available for dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and guidance in the affaires of the houſe of God, ſuch as is this election of Miniſters, nor for the ſalvation of the ſoule in another world, 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 19. 20. &amp; 2. 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Job</hi> 32. 8. 9. though it may be, and is very uſefull therewith. Thirdly, you know and (we doubt not) doe abhorre as much as wee the ſpirit of thoſe men that are proud of their owne lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and vilified Believers in Chriſt for want thereof, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Doe any of the Rulers, or of the Phariſees believe in him? but this people which know not the Law are curſed,</hi> John 7. 47. 48. 49.</p>

And if Chriſt and his twelve Diſciples were the firſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church, it is too much for any man to ſay, that twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or fourty is ſuch a ſmall company that they cannot be a Church.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, for the matter of Government, there is a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between ability and right: In reſpect of the former,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:130517:25"/>
in as much as ſome caſes are more difficult then others, and ſome Churches of leſſe ſpirituall abilities then others, and God doth not afford aſsiſtance and direction at ſome times ſo much as at others; therefore in ſuch caſes it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite that Churches ſhould ſeeke for light, and counſell, and advice, from other Churches: as the Church at <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och</hi> did ſend unto the Church at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> in a Queſtion, which could not bee determined among themſelves, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 2. But this is not becauſe they have no right, but when they are not able.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, as for right let it be conſidered how the Church at <hi>Antioch</hi> did long endevour to have ended that matter amongſt themſelves, before they determined to ſend to <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> verſ. 2. which ſhewes that they had power or right to have tranſacted that buſineſſe among themſelves, if abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty had ſerved; or otherwiſe, that endevour had been ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, as being a preſuming to doe that, whereunto they had no right. We conceive then that every Church, properly ſo called, though they be not above fourty, or twenty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, or ten, or the leaſt number that you mention, have right and power from Chriſt to tranſact all their owne Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall buſineſſes among themſelves, if ſo be they be able, and carry matters juſtly, and according to the Rules of the Word. The power of the Keyes, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 19. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other things noteth Miniſteriall or delegated power of Government; and this power is committed by Chriſt unto the Church, as may appeare, if wee conſider, firſt, to whom Chriſt directed his Speech in that place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; not to <hi>Peter</hi> alone, but to all the Diſciples alſo, for to them all the Queſtion was propounded by Chriſt, <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. And <hi>

                     <p>Secondly, that he and they were not then looked upon as Apoſtles, or generall officers of all Churches (for that Commiſſion was not yet given them) but as Diſciples and Beleevers, believing with the heart, and confeſſing with the mouth Jeſus Chriſt, the rocke upon whom the Church is built; wherein as they did repreſent all Believers, ſo in <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and the reſt, the Keyes are committed to all Believers that ſhall joine together in the ſame confeſſion, according

For this were to make the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church either meerly Democraticall, or meerly Ariſtocraticall, neither of which we believe it ought to be.</p>
                     <p>3. Whereas this Queſtion demandeth to know what acts of Government the Presbyters may doe more then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may doe, and to have thoſe particular acts mentioned: this ſeemeth to us to be a very large demand, for who is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to mention all the particular acts of government, which any one Governour may performe in his time, eſpecially if he continue long in his place? But if your meaning in this Point be not of the Individualls, but of the ſpecies or kinds, yet even there alſo it is much to require the particular men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning of all; yet to give you a taſte take theſe. The cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Aſſemblies and diſmiſsing of the ſame againe; The ordinary preaching of the Word, which is done by way of Office; and being the peoples mouth unto God in Prayer; The diſpenſing of Baptiſme, and the Lords Supper: The permitting of any to ſpeak in an orderly way; and againe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining ſilence: The putting of matters to Vote, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing of ſentence in the cenſure of offendors, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving

in of Penitents after their fall, and bleſsing of the people in the name of the Lord; Theſe are Acts of Church Government, which the Presbyters may doe according to the Word and another member may not do without breach of Order and preſuming above his place.</p>
                     <p>4. It is alſo here demanded, what the Presbyters may do without the particular conſent of the reſt? To which wee anſwer, that when they doe what the Lord Chriſt (whoſe Stewards they are) by his word requires of them in their places, this ſhould not be without the conſent of the reſt, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>or the reſt of the Church ought to conſent thereto: Chriſts Sheep ought to heare his voice, <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. 27. and to obey them that ſpeak unto them in his name, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17. And if any man ſhould in ſuch caſe willfully diſſent, the Church ought to deale with ſuch an one, for not conſenting to the will and waies of Chriſt, or elſe they ſhall all be guilty of the ſinfull diſſent of ſuch an one. So that this Paſſage (if it be meant of Presbyters doing their duty) without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the people, goes upon a ſuppoſall (in reſpect of the people) of that which never ought to be, neither are wee to ſuppoſe but that there may be rule when the <hi>Elders</hi> and Brethren doe not diſſent nor are divided one from another: The multitude of them that believed in the firſt Chriſtian Church at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> were of one heart and of one ſoule, <hi>A l.</hi> 4. 32. Yet none needs to doubt, but there was rule and Government amongſt them, when yet their agreement was ſuch, that the Apoſtles and Flders did nothing without the full conſent of the reſt. It is a miſerable miſtake either to thinke that in the Church of Chriſt the Elders and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren muſt needs diſſent one from another, or if they all conſent, that then there can be no ruling but againſt the peoples minde. They were none of the beſt Shepheards to their flocks unto whom the Lord ſaith, with force and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour have you ruled them. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 34. 4. As for doing any thing in their places<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which the word of Chriſt, the Lord and Maſter of the Church, commandeth not, nor alloweth ſuch things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they neither ought to do nor ought the Church to conſent unto them if they ſhould; for that were to make themſelves partakers of their Rulers ſinnes, and ſo to bring

Judgement upon them all, as when the Prieſts did wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beare rule, and the people loved to have it ſo, <hi>Ieremiah</hi> 5. 31.</p>
                     <p>5. Laſtly, this Queſtion demandeth how, and over whom in thoſe Acts of Government, which are done by the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders more then by other Members, or without the conſent of the reſt, the Presbyters doe rule in propriety of ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king more then the reſt of the Congregation? wherein are ſundry particulars.</p>
                     <p>1. How they rule? Whereunto wee anſwer, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Elders</hi> nor the people doe rule with Lordly and Princely rule, and Soveraigne authority and power; for that is proper to Chriſt over his Church: who is the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Lord, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 5. And King and Lawgiver that is able to ſave and to deſtroy, <hi>Iſa. 33. 23. Pſal. 2. Luk. 19. 27. Jam. 4. 12. The Elders are forbidden to be Lords over Gods heritage, 1 Pet. 5. 3.

They are not ſo to rule, as to doe what themſelves pleaſe, but they muſt do whatſoever <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath commanded, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 20. Mr. <hi>Baine</hi> ſheweth from theſe words there are diverſities of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſteries, but one Lord, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 5. That it is contrary to the Scripture that there ſhould be in the Church more Lords then one: (and ſaith he) look as great Lords have in their Houſes Miniſters of more and leſſe honour, from the Steward to the Scullery, but no Lord-like or Maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like power in any beſides themſelves: So is it with Chriſt and his Church, which is the Houſe of God, wherein hee is the Lord, Apoſtles and others having more or leſſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable ſervices, but no Maſterlike power over the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt of their fellow ſervants: On <hi>Epheſ. 1. 22. p.</hi> 395. and elſewhere he ſaith, no Miniſter of the Word hath any pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er but Miniſteriall in the Church, the power of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles themſelves and <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> is called <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>2. How they rule more then the reſt of the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on do? Whereto the Anſwer is, that this is more then the reſt of the Congregation doe in theſe acts, even as acting is more then conſenting, and as it is more to be a Steward over of the Houſe then one of the houſehold, or to be a guide or leader, then to be guided or led.</p>
                     <p>3. Over whom they doe rule? even over the whole Church in generall, and every Member in particular, even all the flocke over which the Holy Ghoſt hath made them overſeers, <hi>Act. 20. 28. 1 Pet.</hi> 3. 2.</p>
                     <p>The rule is expreſſe and plaine that women ought not to<note place="margin">To 16.</note> ſpeake in the Church, but to be in ſilence, 1 <hi>Cor. 14. 34. 1 Tim.</hi> 2 11, 12. And therefore they ought not to vote in Church matters; beſides voting imports ſome kind of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and authority and power: now it is not govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and authority, but ſubjection and obedience which belongs unto women, by the rule, and ſo is the practice of women amongſt us.</p>
                     <p>Church matters ought not to be determined meerly by<note place="margin">To 17.</note> multitude or plurality of Votes, but by rules from the word of Chriſt, whoſe will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (and not the will either of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor, or Minor part of men,) is the onely rule and Law for Churches, <hi>Iam. 4. 12.

of the whole Church, but yet becauſe it is the minde of Chriſt. But it may be your meaning is in this <hi>Queſtion</hi> to take it for granted that the Churches will be divided in their Votes, and to know what courſe we take at ſuch times: But if Churches lay aſide their owne affections, and give at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance to the rule, and be (as all Churches ought to be) men of humble ſpirits, and ſincere, and withall depend on Chriſt their head and King for guidance, in their worke, we know no neceſsity of ſuch a ſuppoſall, that they muſt needs be divided in their votes, eſpecially conſidering what promiſes he hath made unto his Church, of godly concord and agreement among themſelves, and of his owne graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous preſence in the midſt of them, <hi>Ier. 32. 39. Zeph. 3. 9. Mat.</hi> 18. 20. which promifes we believe are not in vaine. Nevertheleſſe, we deny not but through the corruptions &amp; diſtempers of men, ſome diſſention may ariſe for a time in a true Church, as it was in the Church at <hi>Corinth:</hi> and if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch thing fall out among us (which we bleſſe God is not often) then before matters be put to the vote, our courſe of proceeding is after this manner. If the Elders and Major part of the Church conſent in one concluſion, yet if any brother diſſent, he is patiently heard, and his alledgements of Scripture or good reaſons are duely weighed: If it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare that his judgement is according to the rule, the whole Church will readily yeeld, though before they were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe minded. But if it appeare they who diſſent from the Major part, are factiouſly or partially carried, the reſt labour to convince them of their error by the rule, if they yeeld, the conſent of all comfortably concurreth in the matter; if they ſtill continue obſtinate, they are admoniſhed, and ſo ſtanding under cenſure, their vote is nullified. If they with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out obſtinate oppoſition of the reſt, doe diſſent ſtill, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the matter to the judgement of the Major part of the body they are not wont to proceed to ſentence (if the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be weighty as in Excommunication) till the reaſons on both ſides have bin duly pondered, and all brotherly means have been uſed for mutuall information and conviction. If the difference ſtill continue the ſentence (if the matter be weighty) is ſtill demurred, even till other Churches have
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:130517:36"/>
been conſulted with, who in ſuch a caſe will ſend their El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to communicate their apprehenſions and light, which they do not <hi>pro imperio,</hi> binding the Church to reſt in their dictates but by propounding their grounds from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Theſe courſes with Gods preſence and bleſsing (which uſually accompanieth his Ordinance) faithfully taken and followed, will prevaile either to ſettle one unanimous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or at leaſt to preſerve peace in the Church by the diſſentors ſubmiſsion to the judgement of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor part, though they ſee not light ſufficient to warrant them to act in the buſineſſe: Such ſubjection is according to the rule, <hi>Epheſ. 5. 21. 1 Pet.</hi> 5. 5. If the Church or the Elders ſhould refuſe the teſtimony of other Churches ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to God, they will (after brotherly admonition and due patient waiting) deny them the right hand of fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, till they ſhall give better evidence of their ſubjection to the Goſpel of Chriſt. But thanks be to God we never had occaſion of ſuch withdrawing communion of one Church from another, though now and then (as need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth) Churches ſend to other Churches for their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell and advice.</p>
                     <p>Meanes to preſerve the Churches in unitie and verity,<note place="margin">To 18.</note> and to reforme any that may erre, thankes bee to God we have ſundry.

Secondly, the Miniſtery appointed by Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> of Paſtors, Teachers, Elders, and Deacons, <hi>Epheſ. 4. 11, 12. 1 Cor 12. 28. 1 Tim. 5. 17. 1. Tim. 3. 1, 2. &amp;c</hi> and <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. and in both theſe we have frequently holden forth unto us the Commandement of God, wherein he requires Churches to bee of one mind and one judgement in the truth, 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 10. &amp; 2. 13. 11. Epheſ.</hi> 4. 3. &amp; <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 27. &amp; 2. 1. 2. and his promiſe to lead his people into all truth, and holy agreement therein, <hi>Jer. 32. 29. Iſa</hi> 11 6, 7 &amp;c. <hi>Zeph. 3. 9. Ioh.</hi> 16. 13. with many motives and Rules from Scripture for continuing in the ſaid truth and love. Now Faith makes uſe of theſe promiſes and ſubmits to theſe precepts and exhortations, and ſo both theſe being mixt with Faith
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:130517:36"/>
are profitable meanes by the bleſsing of God for that end aforeſaid, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 2. as theſe Churches have found by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, for theſe yeares ſince our comming into this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey: And any other meanes ſanctified of God for the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid end, we hope we ſhould be glad with thankfull hearts to improve and make uſe of as the Lord ſhall help.</p>
                     <p>As for a Platforme of Doctrine and Diſcipline which you mention, as one meanes hereunto, if thereby you meane no more but a confeſsion of Faith of the holy do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which is according to godlineſſe, we know nothing but it may be lawfull and expedient in ſome caſes for any particular perſon that hath received the gift to doe it; or any Church, or a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>l the Churches in any Chriſtian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, to compile and ſet forth ſuch a platforme. The practiſe of thoſe Churches, whoſe Confeſsions are contained in that booke called <hi>The harmony of Confeſſions,</hi> as alſo of Maſter <hi>Robinſon</hi> at <hi>Leiden,</hi> and others of our Nation in other parts in the <hi>Low-countries,</hi> who have publiſhed ſuch platformes, we ſee no reaſon to condemne or diſallow: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther count we it unlawfull or inexpedient for any Church or Churches, or perſon or perſons in the countrey, upon juſt occaſion to doe the like.</p>
                     <p>But if your meaning be of a platforme to be impoſed by authority upon others, or our ſelves, as a binding Rule of Faith and practice, ſo that all men muſt believe and walke according to that platforme, without adding, altering, or omitting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then we are doubtfull whether ſuch platformes be lawfull or expedient. For if the Doctrine contained therein doe in any particular ſwerve from the Doctrine contained in Scripture then the impoſing of them is ſo far forth unlawfull; and if they be according to it, then they may ſeeme needleſſe, in as much as the forme of whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome words contained in Scripture is ſufficient. Which reaſon againſt ſuch Platformes, makes nothing againſt Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons or Preaching, though Sermons muſt be according to the Doctrine contained in Scripture, becauſe Preaching is an ordinance of God and therefore not needleſſe; which we cannot ſay of ſuch Platformes. Beſides, as they are not neceſſary, ſo they may be a ſnare unto men, and a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:130517:37"/>
temptation of attending more to the forme of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine delivered from the authority of the Church, and the impoſers, then to the examining thereof according to the Rule of Scripture; and ſo their faith may by this meanes ſtand in the wiſedome or will of man, rather then in the power of God, as if men had dominion over their faith; which things ought not ſo to be, 1 <hi>Cor. 2. 5. &amp; 2. 1. ver.</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians have liberty from God to ſearch the Scriptures, and try all things, and hold faſt that which is good, <hi>Act. 17. 11. Ioh. 5. 39. 1 Theſſ.</hi> 5. 21. but the foreſaid impoſing of plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes and confeſsions compiled by men, doth ſeeme to abridge them of that liberty; and if it be any meanes of unity, yet it may be a dangerous hinderance of ſome verity and degree of truth as binding men to reſt in their former apprehenſions and knowledge, without liberty, to better their judgement in thoſe points, and ſhutting the doore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any further light which God may give to his beſt ſervants, and moſt diſcerning, beyond what they ſaw at firſt: And therefore we doubt ſuch impoſed platformes are not lawfull, or at leaſt wiſe not expedient.</p>
                     <p>The conſociation of Churches into <hi>Claſſes</hi> and Synods we hold to be lawfull and in ſome caſes neceſſary; as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in things that are not peculiar to one Church, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to them all: And likewiſe when a Church is not able to end any matter that concernes onely themſelves, then they are to ſeeke for counſell and advice from neighbour Churches; as the Church at <hi>Antioch</hi> did ſend unto the Church at <hi>Ieruſalem, Acts</hi> 15. 2. the ground and uſe of <hi>Claſſes</hi> and Synods, with the limitations therein to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, is ſummarily laid downe by Doctor <hi>Ames, Medul.

And Maſter <hi>Parker</hi> teſtifieth, that in <hi>Genevah,</hi> and in the <hi>Low-countries,</hi> where they have ſome uſe of <hi>Claſſes,</hi> yet it cannot bee ſaid that their particular Congregations are <hi>abſque poteſtate omni in rebus grandtoribus, ut in excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catione;</hi> the particular Churches are not without power in the more weighty matters, as in Excommunication, <hi>Polit. Eccleſ. li. 2. c. 36. Sect. 11. p.</hi> 310. And Maſter <hi>Baine</hi> ſheweth the ſame, ſaying, They have power of governing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but for greater edification voluntarily confederate, not to uſe or exerciſe their power but with mutuall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, one asking the counſell and conſent of the other, <hi>Dioceſ. Triall Q. 1. p.</hi> 21. And a little after <hi>Geneva</hi> made his conſociation, not as if the prime Churches were imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and to make one Church by this union; but becauſe though they were intire Churches, and had the power of Churches, yet they needed ſupport in exerciſing of it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is the very ſame that wee ſaid before in <hi>Q. 14 viz.</hi> That all Churches have right of Government within themſelves, but ſome had need of counſell and advice of others, becauſe they are of leſſe ability to tranſact their owne matters of themſelves. And Maſter <hi>Parker</hi> in the ſame place afore alledged in the page immediately prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, clearly ſheweth againſt Doctor <hi>Downham,</hi> Doctor <hi>Sutcliffe,</hi> and others, that thoſe particular Congregations which have Presbyters of their owne, with power within themſelves, are the moſt perfect, and are preciſely formed <hi>juxta formam illam quae in verbo patefacta eſt,</hi> according to that forme which is revealed in the Word; whereas others which have not the like are more defective and imperfect. And if this be ſo, then to binde Churches to do no weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty matters without the counſell and conſent of <hi>Claſſes,</hi> were to blinde them to bee imperfect. And for Synods, if they have ſuch power that their determination ſhall binde the Churches to obedience (as you ſpeake) it is more then we yet underſtand.

That is, the right of Impoſition of hands is not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to the eſſence of a Paſtor, no more then the Coronation to the eſſence of a King, or the Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Marriage to the eſſence thereof.</p>
                     <p>Ordination of Miniſters is not a private action but pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique,<note place="margin">To 21.</note> and ought to be done publiquely in the Aſſembly of the Church, and therefore the perſons that performe it, (whether they be ordinary Church Officers or no) cannot in any congruity of ſpeech be called meere private perſons in that Action.</p>
                     <p>2. The Church that hath no Officers, may elect Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers or Miniſters unto themſelves, therefore it may alſo ordaine them; which Argument Dr. <hi>Whitaker</hi> uſeth as wee ſhall ſee anon. If it have Commiſsion and power from Chriſt for the one, and that the greater, it hath it alſo for the other which is the leſſer: Now ordination is leſſe then election, and depends upon it as a neceſſary Antecedent by divine Inſtitution, by vertue of which it is juſtly admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred, being indeed nothing elſe but the admiſsion of a perſon lawfully elected into his Office, or a putting of him into poſſeſsion thereof, whereunto he had right before by election, as was ſaid before in anſwer to the precedent Queſtion.</p>
                     <p>3. If a Church have Miniſters or Elders before, then this ordination is to be performed by the Elders of the Church, and in their Aſſemblie. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 14. as alſo many other acts are to be performed by them.</p>

This Ordination thus performed by the Elders for the Church, may fitly be called the Act of the whole Church, as it is the whole man that ſeeth, that heareth, that ſpeaketh, when theſe acts are inſtrumentally performed by the eye, the eare, and the tongue, in which ſenſe Maſter <hi>Parker</hi> ſaith, <hi>Eccleſia per alios docet, baptiſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>5. But when a Church hath no Officers, but the firſt Officers themſelves are to be ordained, then this Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the Rite of impoſing of hands may be performed for the Church by the moſt prime grave and able men from among themſelves, as the Church ſhall depute hereunto, as the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did lay their hands upon the <hi>Levites, Numb.</hi> 8. 10. Now all the Congregation could not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe all their hands upon them together, all their hands could not poſsibly reach them together, and therefore it muſt needs be that ſome of the Congregation in the name of the whole body performed this Rite: And as this Scripture ſheweth, that the people may in ſome caſes lay their hands upon Church Officers, (for the <hi>Levites</hi> were ſuch, upon whom the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did lay their hands) ſo let it be conſidered, whether theſe reaſons doe not fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther make it manifeſt.</p>
                     <p>1. Men that are in no Office may elect, therefore they may ordaine, becauſe ordination is nothing elſe but the execution of Election.</p>
                     <p>2. If it were not ſo then one of theſe would follow, either that the Officers muſt miniſter without any Ordination at all, or elſe by vertue of ſome former Ordination recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in ſome other Church or elſe they muſt be ordained by ſome other Miniſter or Miniſters of ſome other Church, that were ordained afore them, and ſo the Miniſtery to be by ſucceſsion. But the firſt of theſe is againſt the Scripture, 1 <hi>Tim. 4. 14. Heb.</hi> 6. 2. And the ſecond were to eſtabliſh the Popiſh opinion of the indeleble Character, imprinted as they imagine in their Sacrament of holy Orders. Whereas for ought we can diſcerne. If when they are called to Office in any Church, they have need of a new Election, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their former election into another Church
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:130517:40"/>
then they have by the ſame ground need of a new Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for Ordination depends upon Election: If their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Election be ceaſed, their former Ordination is ceaſed alſo; and they can no more miniſter by vertue of a former <hi>Ordination</hi> unto another <hi>Church,</hi> then by vertue of a former Election. And for the third, we doe not underſtand what authority ordinary Officers can have to ordaine Miniſters to ſuch a Church, of which themſelves are not ſo much as Members Beſides at ſome times, namely at the firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation after the times of Popery, there were no others to be had but from the Pope, and his Biſhops and Prieſts. Now it were a pittifull caſe, if the Sheep muſt have no Shepherd but ſuch as are appointed to them by the wolves, That is, if Gods people might not have Miniſters, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the popiſh Biſhops. This were to ſay, either that the Miniſters of Antichriſt, muſt, or may ordaine Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to the Church of Chriſt, or elſe that the popiſh Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops are true Miniſters of Chriſt. And if Proteſtants thinke it neceſſary, that their firſt Miniſters ſhould be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by the popiſh Biſhops, it is no marvell if the Papiſts do thereupon believe that their Church is the true Church, and their Biſhops true Miniſters. Such a ſcandall is it unto them to maintaine this perſonall ſucceſsion of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery. But God doth ſo much abhorre <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> that hee would not have his people to ſeek to him, nor his Prieſts to ordaine Chriſts Miniſters, as he would not take of <hi>Babilon</hi> a ſtone for a Corner, nor a ſtone for a foundation, <hi>Ier.</hi> 51. 26.</p>
                     <p>3. It is thus in civill Corporations and Cities, the Major, Bayliffe, or other chiefe Officer elect, is at his entrance and inauguration to receive at the hands of his Predeceſſors the Sword or Keyes of the City, or to have ſome other ſolemne Ceremonie by him performed unto him yet if either there be no former as at the firſt or that the former be dead or upon neceſsity abſent, when his Succeſſor entreth, then is this Ceremony and worke performed by ſome other, the fitteſt Inſtrument; neither need that City borrow any Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer of another City, neither could he entermeddle there without uſurpation, though both the Corporations have the ſame Charter under the ſame King. And ſo it is in this
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:130517:40"/>
ſpirituall Corporation or City, the Church of God.</p>
                     <p>4. That this point may ſeeme the leſſe ſtrange to you, we pray you conſider with us a little further the nature of this Ordination, and then wee will adde the Teſtimonies of ſome eminent Proteſtant Writers in this caſe, that you may ſee this is not any ſingular opinion of ours. For the former, ſome indeed have ſo highly advanced this Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that they have preferred it farre above preaching the Word, miniſtring the Sacraments, and Prayer, making it and the power of Excommunication, the two incommunicable Prerogatives of a Biſhop above an ordinary Miniſter; yet the Scripture teacheth no ſuch thing, but rather the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, for when the Apoſtles were ſent out by Chriſt, there was no mention of Ordination in that Commiſsion of theirs, but only of teaching &amp; preaching &amp; baptiſing <hi>Mat. 28. 19, 20. Mark.</hi> 16. 15, 16. If Ordination of Miniſters had bin ſuch a ſpeciall worke, there would belike have bin ſome mention of it in their Commiſsion. And certaine it is, the Apoſtles counted preaching the Word their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall worke, and after it Prayer, and the miniſtring of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, <hi>Act. 6. 4. 1 Cor.</hi> 1. 17. If ordaining of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters had bin in their account ſo prime a worke, it may ſeem <hi>Paul</hi> would rather have tarried in <hi>Creete</hi> to have ordained Elders there then have gone himſelfe about preaching, ſeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Titus</hi> for the other, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1 5. By all which it appeares, that ordaining of Miniſters is not ſuch an eminent work as that it is to be preferred above preaching the Word, and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring the Sacraments, and therefore to be performed by them that are ſuperiours unto ordinary Miniſters; prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and miniſtring the Sacraments, being left as inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our workes unto Miniſters, of an inferiour ranke, as they would have it, that ſtand for the ſuperiority of Doceſan Biſhops; neither is it equall unto thoſe other workes afore mentioned, that onely he that doth thoſe, may performe this other alſo, as ſome others thinke; but being nothing elſe in the true nature and uſe of it but the execution and accompliſhment and confirmation of election, it may bee performed by the people of God, that yet have no Officers, even as Election may upon which it doth depend.</p>

                        <pb n="72" facs="tcp:130517:41"/>5. Laſtly, let theſe ſayings of ſome Proteſtant Writers of ſingular note, either for holineſſe, or learning, or both, be well conſidered of. Maſter <hi>Perkins</hi> ſaith, Succeſsion of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine alone is ſufficient; for this Rule muſt bee remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, that the power of the Keyes (that is, of order and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction) is tyed by God and annexed in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Doctrine. If in <hi>Turkey,</hi> or <hi>America,</hi> or elſewhere, the Goſpel ſhould be received by the counſell and perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of private perſons, they need not ſend into <hi>Europe</hi> for conſecrated Miniſters, but they have power to chooſe their owne Miniſters from within themſelves; becauſe where God gives the Word he gives the power alſo; <hi>upon Gal.</hi> 1. 11. Doctor <hi>Willet</hi> ſaith, Whereas <hi>Bellarmine</hi> objecteth that as in the old Law the Prieſthood went by carnall generation and lineall deſcent from <hi>Aaron,</hi> ſo in the New it muſt bee derived by ſucceſsion from the Apoſtles; we anſwere, firſt, that our Saviour Chriſt and his Apoſtles could ſhew no li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neall deſcent from <hi>Aaron,</hi> neither had their ordination from his Succeſſors, and yet were the true Paſtors of the Church. And a little after, This we ſay further, that both before Chriſt there were true Paſtors and Prophets, which were not ordained by the Prieſts of <hi>Aaron;</hi> and ſince Chriſt, that received not their ordination ſucceſsively from the Apoſtles. Firſt, in the old Law, when the ordinary Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood was corrupted, God raiſed up Prophets from other Tribes that received not from the Prieſts their ordination and allowance: ſuch an one was <hi>Amos,</hi> who was among Heardſmen, and was made a Prophet as he was gathering wilde black-berries. After the ſame manner in the corrupt times of the Goſpel, the Lord hath raiſed up faithfull Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to his Church, that could ſhew no ſucceſsion from the degenerate Clergy. And a little after, If <hi>Paul</hi> were made an Apoſtle without the ordination of the lawfull A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles much more may the Lord raiſe up new Paſtors to his Church without ordination from the uſurpers of the Apoſtles: <hi>Synopſ.

for calling or allowance of them who under the title of Paſtors oppreſſed the Lords Flock, did at firſt preach with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this formall calling, and afterward were choſen and called to the holy Miniſtey by the Churches which they had taught; yet this ought to ſeeme no more ſtrange, then if in a free common-wealth the people without waiting ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the conſent, or for the voices of thoſe that tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize over them, ſhould (according to the Lawes) make choice of good and wiſe Magiſtrates, ſuch (happily) as God would ſerve his turne of for their deliverance, and for the publike reſtitution.

                     <p>We doe believe that every Miniſter of the Goſpel ought<note place="margin">To 26.</note> to be maintained with ſufficient and honourable mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, according to his need and occaſions, in regard of his perſon, calling, charge of children and hoſpitality, ſo as he that preacheth the Goſpel may in all theſe reſpects live

And this maintenance is not to be allowed as almes and courteſie, but as debt and duty, to bee paid according to the rule of Juſtice; the Labourer is worthy of his wages, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. 17. which the Apoſtle ſheweth to be according to all Lawes of nature, nations, <hi>Moſes</hi> and Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. But for ſetled and ſtinted maintenance, there is nothing done that way amongſt us, except from yeare to yeare, becauſe the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Miniſters may vary, and of the Church to which they doe belong: Neither doe we know any ſuch thing to be appointed by Chriſt our Lord, for the maintenance of the Miniſtery in theſe dayes; but this we know that the great mountaine burning with fire, caſt into the ſea upon the ſounding of the ſecond Trumpet <hi>Rev.</hi> 8. 8, 9. is applyed by ſome good Writers to thoſe times, when <hi>Conſtantine</hi> brought ſetled endowments into the Church, with <hi>ampla praedia</hi> (as they are called) are counted by ſome to bee no better then poyſon to the Church; as the Stories ſay that upon the fact of the good Emperour a voice was heard, which ſaid, <hi>Hodie ſeminatum eſt virus in Eccleſiam.</hi> And if thoſe Writers be not deceived which ſo expound that Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture (as for our parts wee know not but they expound it truely) then in as much as upon the caſting of that moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine into the ſea, a third part of it became blood and a third part of living creatures dyed, and a third part of ſhips were deſtroyed, it may be truely gathered thence that the bringing in of ſetled endowments and eminent preferments into the Church, hath been the corruption, and to ſome the deſtruction of ſuch as lived by them, both Church-of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers and Church-members.</p>
                     <p>We doe not permit, and call upon (ſuch whom you call)<note place="margin">To 27.</note> meere Lay men, and private perſons, neither being in the Miniſtery nor intended to it, ordinarily to preach or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy publiquely, in or before the Congregation, if by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily, you meane frequently and uſually. For where or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Officers are not wanting to a Church, and neither detained from their worke by ſickneſſe, nor juſt abſence, we thinke it moſt meet to offer our Sacrifice to God and to the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:130517:44"/>
Church of our beſt gifts. But yet if you oppoſe ordinary to extraordinary, we doe confeſſe that ſome private mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers (to wit ſuch as are eminently fitted with knowledge and utterance, being alſo men of humble ſpirits, and holy lives, all which qualifications we finde but in a few) may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an extraordinary calling from God be called forth by by the Church upon ſome occaſion (and namely in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence or bodily weakneſſe of Miniſters, or for tryall of gifts when a man intends the Miniſtery) to ſpeake to edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, exhortation and comfort. <hi>Iehoſaphat</hi> ſent Princes (who neither were Miniſters, nor intended ſo to be) to teach with the Prieſts and Levites, to wit, at leaſt to incourage the people, to hearken to the Prieſts and Levites come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17. 7, 8, 9.

We conceive as ſome things in it be extraordinary, ſo ſome things ordinary. Extraordinary, that private men, and new converts ſhould be ſo ſoon &amp; ſo ſuddainly, &amp; ſo much enlightened &amp; enlarged, as to be able to prophecy publike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the edification of a whole Church: But yet this we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to be ordinary, that ſome private men may be found (at leaſt in ſome Churches) grown Chriſtians, of able gifts, who may have received a gift of Prophecy, and for ſuch we doe not thinke it requireth any more an extraordinary cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for them to prophecy in our Churches, then for <hi>Iehoſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat</hi> and his Princes to prophecy in the Church of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Our Anſwer to this Queſtion is that we never knew any<note place="margin">To 28.</note> Miniſters that did call upon the people thus to doe: and as for us, ſuch calling upon them is farre from us. All that we know to be holden in this caſe is this, that ſome thinke the people have a liberty to aske a Queſtion publiquely for their better ſatisfaction upon very urgent and weighty cauſe, though even this is doubted of by others, and all judge the ordinary practice of it, not neceſſary: but (if it be not meekly and wiſely carried) to be inconvenient if not utterly unlawfull, and therefore ſuch asking of Queſtions is ſeldome uſed in any Church among us, and in moſt Churches never. True it is, in the times a little afore the Synod divers that were infected with corrupt opinions
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:130517:44"/>
were very bold, &amp; forward in this kind of asking Queſtions, after <hi>Sermons,</hi> eſpecially when they had heard ſomthing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered publiquely that did make againſt their Tenents; by which kind of asking Queſtions, they plainely diſcovered of what ſpirit they were, but for being called upon by us thus to doe, (as it ſeems to your Queſtion that you have been informed) the truth is, there was no ſuch matter. But now theſe men are long ſince, (the greateſt part of them) to an Iſland (called <hi>Aquedneck</hi>) departed from amongſt us, ſome of them being excommunicated or baniſhed, or both, &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers departing voluntarily, or for feare of the like cenſure, by meanes of which departure of theſe troubleſome ſpirits from amongſt us, and the bleſsing of God upon the Synod &amp; Sermons that have laid open &amp; reproved this diſorderly asking of Queſtions, a man may now live from one end of the year unto another in theſe Congregations, &amp; not hear any man open his mouth in ſuch kind of asking Queſtions.</p>
                     <p>1. The converſion of ſinners unto God doth not alwaies<note place="margin">To 29.</note> follow the preaching of every one, that is in a lawfull of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of miniſtery, as experience and Scripture doe aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly witneſſe, <hi>Iſay. 49. 4, 5. &amp; 53. 1. Ezech. 3. 7. 2 King. 17. 13 14. Mat.</hi> 11. 20, 21. &amp;c. <hi>Iohn</hi> 12. 37.</p>
                     <p>2. And when it doth follow, it is not by vertue of him, or of his office, but by vertue of Gods bleſsing, and the mighty operation of his ſpirit as he pleaſeth, without which the Miniſter and his office could have had no vertue at all to convert ſinners unto God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6. no more then <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> could heale the lame man, by virtue of any pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or holineſſe that was in them, <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 12. For otherwiſe faithfull Miniſters ſhould not have their labours bleſſed for converſion ſome more and ſome leſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but all in the ſame meaſure, inaſmuch as one of them is no more a Miniſter then another, nor no more in Office then another, their office being the ſame, the effect in converſion would bee the ſame if converſion were by the vertue of their office. The truth it is, the Law of the Lord, (the whole Word of God) that converts the ſoule, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 7. And the Goſpell that is the power of God unto Salvation. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 16. And therefore the converſion of a man to God is to be aſcribed to God, and to the Word of his Grace; and not to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, nor any vertue of his office.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="80" facs="tcp:130517:45"/>3. But this we doe acknowledge, that the ſound conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſinners, whenſoever ſuch a thing comes to paſſe, doth argue that the Inſtruments of ſuch converſion are ſent of God: God would not ſo have bleſſed them, as to convert any by them, if himſelfe had not ſent them at all, <hi>Rom. 10. 14, 15. Ier.</hi> 23. 32.</p>
                     <p>4. And yet we dare not ſay, that Gods Word is not made effectuall to converſion, unleſſe the man that ſpeakes it be a Miniſter, that is to ſay, a Church Officer, for the contrary is evident from the Scripture, <hi>John 4. 39. Act.</hi> 8. 4. with 11. 19, 20, 21. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 16. They that were ſcattered abroad upon the perſecution that aroſe about <hi>Steven,</hi> were not Church Officers, at leaſt all of them (for the Apoſtles who were their chiefe, if not their only preaching Officers, were not ſcattered abroad upon that perſecution, but remained ſtill at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Acts 8. 1.) and yet theſe men did ſo preach the Word of the Lord Jeſus to the <hi>Iewes</hi> and the <hi>Grecians,</hi> that through the good hand of the Lord that was with them, a great number believed and turned to the Lord; And the ſame we ſay of the woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> by whoſe Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of Chriſt many of the <hi>Samaritans</hi> believed on him. To reſtraine the efficacy of Gods Word in ſuch ſort as to ſay that none can be converted by it, unleſſe he that ſpeakes it be a Miniſter, is to limit the ſpirit of the Lord, where he hath not limited himſelf, who is free in working by whom he pleaſeth, and as he will, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 11. Even as the wind bloweth where it liſteth, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 8. and ſometimes doth bring to paſſe great things by weake meanes, that his owne glory may be the more, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 27, 28, 29. If any ſay, how can theſe things ſtand together, that a man that is no Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter may be an Inſtrument of converſion, and yet converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſinners argues that the man is ſent of God? Wee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that we muſt diſtinguiſh of ſending according to the divers degrees thereof. For ſometimes it imports no more but ſuch an Act of Gods diſpoſing providence, whereby men are gifted and enabled for ſuch or ſuch a worke, and permitted thereunto, though they have no command from him for the doing thereof, nor doe it not with a ſincere minde in any obedience to God, but for corrupt and ſiniſter
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:130517:45"/>
ends of their owne. Thus God ſent the King of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> againſt the <hi>Iewes,</hi> Iſa. 10. 6. And bands of the <hi>Caldees,</hi> and bands of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations againſt <hi>Jehojakim,</hi> and againſt <hi>Iudah,</hi> to deſtroy it, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 24. 2. And yet they had no command from him to doe this, but ſinned grievouſly in ſo doing. Thus they that prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched Chriſt not ſincerely, but of envie and ſtrife, to adde af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction to <hi>Pauls</hi> bands, yet inaſmuch as they preached Chriſt, might be ſaid to be ſent of God, and therefore the Apoſtle joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at their preaching, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 15, 16. Thus <hi>Baalam</hi> in his Prophecies againſt the enemies of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and for the happy ſtate of Gods people, might be ſaid to be ſent of God, though his heart and ends were corrupt and ſinfull. But if men be not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enabled with gifts for ſuch or ſuch a worke, but beſides this, have a ſincere minde and deſire in the uſing thereof, to ſeeke the glory of God, and the good of ſoules, ſuch men may much more be ſaid to be ſent of God, <hi>Iohn</hi> 7. 18. For theſe men have not onely abilities and gifts from God, and permiſsion to imploy them as the former had but alſo his ſpirit within them, which doth ſet their hearts on right and holy ends, which the other wanted. And yet if men doe want a lawfull office of Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, wherein to exerciſe thoſe gifts or a lawfull calling to that office or exerciſe, they may in that reſpect be ſaid not to be ſent of God, or not to be called of him though ſent of him, in the firſt or ſecond reſpect. Thus in the Scriptures it is ſaid of ſome they ran and I ſent them not, <hi>Ier.</hi> 23. 21. I perceived that God had not ſent him, but he pronounced his Prophecies, becauſe <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballat</hi> and <hi>Tobiah</hi> had hired him, <hi>Neh.</hi> 6. 12. And yet doubtleſſe in reſpect of Gods diſpoſing providence, he had ſent them, as the Scripture witneſſeth, that God ſends ſtrong deluſions and lying Prophets, and unfaithfull Shepherds, 2 <hi>Theſ. 2. 11. 1 King. 22. 22, 23. Zech.</hi> 11. 16. to be a plague unto the Sons of men, and for tryall to his ſervants, <hi>Deut. 13. 3. 1 Cor.</hi> 11. 19. Now let theſe diſtinctions be applyed to the caſe in hand, and we may perceive how, if a man convert ſinners, certainly God ſends him; and yet ſome that are not called to any office in the Miniſtery, may through his bleſsing convert ſinners: A man converts none unleſſe God ſend him in the firſt or ſecond ſence and yet he may convert, and not bee ſent, if ſending be taken in the third ſence, that is for a lawfull calling into ſome office in the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:130517:46"/>
Church. And wee may adde, further a man may be ſent in this third ſence and yet convert none if he be not alſo ſent in the firſt and ſecond reſpect; that is a man may have a lawfull calling out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly unto a lawfull office in the Church, and yet not convert ſinners, if he want gifts or ſincerity of heart, which might be the caſe of <hi>Iudas,</hi> and of many wicked Prieſts in the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Yea, happily convert none though he be truly ſent in all three reſpects, as was ſaid before in the beginning of the Anſwer to this Quaere. But if compariſon be made, we doubt not, but whileſt the Miniſtery remaines uncorrupt, God is wont to follow with a greater bleſsing the labours of thoſe who have gifts and an office of Miniſtery alſo, then of thoſe who have gifts alone without office. He is willing, and wonted to honour himſelfe moſt, where moſt of his wayes are obſerved.</p>

Eccleſ. l. 2. c.</hi> 42. and ſo forward to the end of that Book, unto whom we refer you herein. And if that Diſcipline which we here practiſe, be (as we are perſwaded of it) the ſame which Chriſt hath appointed, and therefore unalterable, we ſee not how another can be lawfull; and therefore if a company of people ſhall come hither, and here ſet up and practiſe another, we pray you thinke not much, if we cannot promiſe to approve of them in ſo doing, eſpecially untill wee ſee how approvable the men may be, and what Diſcipline it is that they would ſet up. For ſhould wee in ſuch generall words as is there expreſſed, promiſe to accept of a companie as a Siſter Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that ſhall ſet up and practiſe another Diſcipline, and then ſhould be taken at the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt extent of our words, we might by this meanes be bound to accept of a company of Papiſts, or Arminians, or Familiſts, or Anabaptiſts, as a ſiſter Church, for there is none of theſe but ſomething may be found in them, and in their Diſcipline, that is in ſome meaſure approveable. And yet we pray you heartily in the Lord, ſo conceive of us in this paſſage, that we are farre from making any ſuch compariſon, as if your ſelves were not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved in our conſciences far above the beſt of ſuch men, yea and above our ſelves in many reſpects.</p>
                     <p>We have ſaid before in that which we ſent you the laſt yeare, and upon this occaſion we ſay it now againe, that you are in our hearts (if the Lord would ſuffer) to live and dye together: and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:130517:47"/>
therefore if this Queſtion were meant of your ſelves, or any of you, and a company of godly people joyning with you (as it may be it is, though we cannot certainly ſay it, becauſe you doe not expreſſe ſo much) we thinke if you were here, wee ſhould gladly accept of you and your people as a ſiſter-Church, and that you would doe the like to ours; and yet not when you ſhould ſet up and practiſe one forme of Church-diſcipline, and we another, but becauſe we are perſwaded if you were here, you would ſet up and practiſe the very ſame that wee doe, and not any other: or elſe if we be ſwerving from the rule in any particular (as God knowes we are but weake men, and far from dreaming of perfection in this life) God would by you ſend in more light unto us then yet we ſee, and make you inſtruments in his hand for perfecting what is here begun according to his will, for ſtrengthening what is weake, and reforming what may be found to be amiſſe: For we truſt in the Lord, that as wee are deſirous that you might joyne with us in the wayes wherein we now walke, (which we doe not ſee but they are according to the Rule) ſo we ſhould be as willing to receive light from you, and to redreſſe (as God ſhall helpe us) whatſoever by you or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he may diſcover to us to ſtand in need of Reformation. For which cauſe among others we doe the more earneſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, if it were the Lords will that he might ſend you hither, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing doubting but if you were here, there would be ſuch agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between you and us, that either you would approve of the things which we beleeve and practiſe, or that we ſhould approve of what you may ſhevv us to be more agreeable to the minde of Chriſt: and then there would be no occaſion of ſuch a Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Whether we may ſet up and practiſe another diſcipline, and yet be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted as a ſiſter-Church:</hi> but rather of bleſsing the Lord, when that ſhall be accompliſhed in you and us which is written in the Prophets, <hi>I will give them one heart and one way: I will turne unto the people a pure language, that they may all call upon the Name of the Lord, to ſerve him with one conſent,</hi> Jer. 32. 39. Zeph. 3. 9. <hi>Wee have confidence in you through the Lord, that you will be none otherwiſe min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;</hi> but if in any thing ye be <hi>otherwiſe minded God ſhall reveale even this unto you,</hi> Gal. 5. 10. Phil. 3. 15.</p>
                     <p>This was anſwered in the anſwer to Poſit. 1. &amp; 2. ſent unto you<note place="margin">To 32.</note> the laſt yeare.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough that which is foretold in theſe two Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and namely in the fourth and fifth verſes of this Chapter, was in part fulfilled when the people of God returned from Captivitie in <hi>Babylon</hi> at the end of ſeventie yeares: yet we muſt not limit the place to that time onely, but may extend it further to the dayes of the Goſpel, and the ſpirituall return, not of the Jews onely, but of the Gentiles alſo, when men ſhall be converted from Pagan, Antichriſtian, Babyloniſh, or Jewiſh bondage and capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitie, or from ſlavery to ſinne, and ſelf-righteouſneſſe, and ſhall be joyned to God in the fellowſhip of his Church, in the dayes of the New Teſtament. For as ſome paſſages in this Scripture were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fully accompliſhed at the returne from the captivitie of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventie yeares, and namely this, that the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> ſhould returne both together: (for the ten tribes returned not
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:130517:49"/>
at all:) ſo many things that literally concerned the Jewes were types and figures, ſignifying the like things concerning the people of God in theſe latter dayes: In which reſpect ſincere converts are called Jewes, <hi>Rom</hi> 2. 29. and Iſraelites, <hi>Gal. 6. 16. Joh.</hi> 1. 47. and our Sacraments are made Antitypes of theirs, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 1, 2, 3. and Rome is called Babylon, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 5. and Papiſts are called Gentiles, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 2. and therefore the captivitie of Babylon might well be a Type of the ſpirituall captivitie of Gods people to Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian bondage, and their returne from Babylon to Sion, a type of the returne of Chriſtians from Romiſh ſlavery to the true Sion, the Chriſtian Church. And this may be added further, that this place ſeemes not onely to be meant of the private or perſonall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of this or that particular Chriſtian, but alſo further, of the open and joynt calling of a company, becauſe it is ſaid, they ſhall come, the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and the children of <hi>Judah</hi> together, and that their ſaying ſhall not be, <hi>Let me joyne, &amp;c.</hi> but in the Plurall number, <hi>Let us joyne our ſelves unto the Lord,</hi> ſo noting the joyning of a company together in holy Covenant with God.</p>
                  <p>Concerning which Covenant with God, it will not be amiſſe for the better underſtanding of that which followes; firſt, briefly to ſhew how diverſly Covenant is taken in the Scripture, which ſometimes imports generally any firme appointment or promiſe of God, when man doth not promiſe unto God any thing backe againe: Thus the preſerving of <hi>Noah</hi> in the Arke, and of the world from being drowned any more by a floud; the interchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable ſucceſſion of day and night; the giving of the Prieſthood unto <hi>Phineas;</hi> the ſetting forth of the Shew-bread every Sabbath before the Lord, and the giving of the heave-offering unto the Prieſts, are ſaid to be done by a Covenant, or an everlaſting Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of God, <hi>Gen. 6. 18. &amp; 9. 9, 10, 11. Jer. 33. 20. Num. 25. 12, 13. Levit. 24. 8. Num.</hi> 18. 19. But ſometimes Covenant is taken more ſtrictly and properly, for an agreement which God doth make with men, when he promiſeth ſome bleſſing unto men, and bindes them to performe ſome dutie backe againe to him. Taken thus it hath two parts: firſt, a promiſe or ſtipulation of ſome bleſſing on Gods part: ſecondly, Reſtipulation or promiſe, or binding of man unto dutie back againe on his part: both theſe are in thoſe words of the Covenant, <hi>I will be to thee a God, thou ſhalt be to me a people:</hi> and ſo <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 1. &amp; <hi>v.</hi> 7, 8, 9, 10. The Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:130517:49"/>
taken thus is either the Covenant of workes, or the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace: And againe the Covenant may be conſidered; firſt as it is perſonall, private and particular, between God and one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſoule, making Covenant with God, and God with him, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at his firſt converſion; or at other times; of which we reade 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 5. &amp; <hi>Pſal. 119, 106. &amp; 66. 13, 14. &amp;</hi> 27 8. &amp; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 7, 8 Secondly, it is generall and publick of a company joyntly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, of which this Text <hi>Jer.</hi> 50. 5. ſeemes moſt properly to ſpeake: as alſo that <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 9, 10, &amp;c. and that <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 5, 6, and many others: A Covenant taken thus generally when it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects ſpirituall bleſſings, and ſpirituall duties, in the Communion of Saints, is that which is called Church-covenant, which Church-Covenant differs not in ſubſtance of the things promiſed from that which is between the Lord and every particular ſoule, but onely in ſome other reſpects; as firſt, the one is of one Chriſtian in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, the other of a company joyntly together. Secondly, if right Order be obſerved, a man ought not to enter into Church-Covenant, till he be in Covenant with God before, in reſpect of his perſonall eſtate. Thirdly, The one is uſually done in private, as in a mans Cloſet between the Lord and his ſoule, and the other in ſome publick aſſembly. Fourthly, The one in theſe dayes is of ſuch duties as the Goſpel requires of every Chriſtian as a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, the other of ſuch duties as the Goſpel requires of every Church and the members thereof.</p>
                  <p>Now concerning Church-Covenant, two things are to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the better underſtanding thereof: firſt, the deſcription of it: ſecondly, the uſe of it, and the benefit and fruit thereof. For the former it may be thus deſcribed, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                     <q>
                        <hi>A ſolemne and publick promiſe before the Lord, whereby a company of Chriſtians, called by the power and mercy of God to fellowſhip with Chriſt, and by his providence to live together, and by his grace to cleave together in the unitie of faith, and brotherly love, and deſirous to partake together in all the holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of God, doe in confidence of his gracious acceptance in Chriſt, binde themſelves to the Lord, and one to another, to walke together by the aſſiſtance of his Spirit, in all ſuch wayes of holy worſhip in him, and of edification one towards another, as the Goſpel of Chriſt requireth of every Chriſtian Church, and the members thereof.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this deſcription, there are compriſed ſix things: Firſt, the generall name of the thing: [<hi>a ſolemne and publick promiſe</hi>] a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:130517:50"/>
it is, and therefore it is called, a joyning in Covenant here: an entring into Covenant, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 10. Solemne and publick, and therefore it is by the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and the children of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> together: and they ſay, <hi>let us joyne.</hi> Secondly, The object <hi>[the Lord, and one another] joyne our ſelves to the Lord</hi> it is not a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe onely to man, but to the Lord himſelfe, and likewiſe to one another; for, <hi>come let us joyne,</hi> implyes mutuall conſent together. Thirdly, The Agents or the qualification of the perſons: [<hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi>] not Turkes, Indians, &amp;c. Saints, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 5. 16, 17. [<hi>called to fellowſhip with Chriſt</hi>] ſo 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 9 elſe if they be not united to Chriſt by faith, they are not fit materialls for ſuch a building as a Church of God, which is the houſe of the living God, <hi>Epheſ. 1. 1. 1 Cor. 1. 2. Phil. 1. 1. Rev.</hi> 21. 27. [<hi>By his providence to live toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>] elſe they cannot partake in the Lords Ordinances together as Churches ought to doe, 1 <hi>Cor. 14. 23. Act.</hi> 14 27. the whole Church comes together in one place [<hi>cleaving together in faith and love</hi>] ſo <hi>Act.</hi> 4 32. If they differ, namely, in opinion, or in their affection, and ſhould joyne in this Covenant, breaches, factions, rents, and ſchiſmes, would be like to be the iſſue of ſuch joyning: things ſo unlike would not cloſe nor long hold together, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 43 [<hi>Deſirous to partake in all Ordinances</hi>] this ſhould be the ground of their joyning in Covenant together, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. 3. willing: and not pride, nor gaine, nor the like: Fourthly, The Act [<hi>binde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves</hi>] that now they are bound by their owne word and promiſe, that they may ſay now, as <hi>Pſal. 56. 12. Thy vowes are upon me,</hi> or as <hi>Num.</hi> 30. 2. if he binde his ſoule with a vow. Fiftly, The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter promiſed; [<hi>To walke together in all ſuch wayes of worſhip and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall edification, as the Goſpel requireth of Churches and Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi>] they binde not themſelves to obſerve any deviſes of their owne, nor inventions of men, but ſuch things as the word of God requireth; neither is it perfect obedience to the Law, for that were impoſſible to performe, and preſumption to promiſe; nor is it one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in generall the duties of the Goſpel, but ſpecially ſuch duties of worſhip to God, &amp; edification of one another as concerne Church-State, which now they enter into. Sixtly, The manner of perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming [<hi>Confidence of Gods gracious acceptance and aſſiſtance through Chriſt</hi>] for in all our wayes God muſt be acknowledged, <hi>Pro.</hi> 3. 6. and much more in ſuch ſpeciall matters of weight: If men in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into this Covenant looke for acceptance, through any worth
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:130517:50"/>
of their owne, or promiſe dutie in their own ſtrength, they ſhew themſelves like to the Phariſees, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. 10, 11. and turne the Church-Covenant into a Covenant of workes: and as many as are of the workes of the Law, are under the curſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10.</p>
                  <p>The uſe and benefit of this Church-Covenant, and the fruit thereof, may be ſeene in two particulars; firſt, That this is that whereby a company of Chriſtians doe become a Church: It is the Conſtituting forme of a Church. Secondly, This is that by taking hold whereof a particular perſon becomes a member of a Church, which was conſtituted afore. For the former of theſe; every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church muſt have in it both matter and forme, and as the matter by Gods appointment are viſible Saints, or viſible belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, <hi>Epheſ. 1. 1. 1 Cor.</hi> 1. 2. and in the New Teſtament, onely ſo many as may meete together in one Congregation: So the forme is a uniting, or combining, or knitting of thoſe Saints together in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one viſible body, by the band of this holy Covenant. Some uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or band there muſt be amongſt them, whereby they come to ſtand in a new relation to God, and one towards another, other then they were in before: or els they are not yet a Church, though they be fit materialls for a Church; even as ſoule and body are not a man, unleſſe they be united; nor ſtones and timber an houſe, till they be compacted and conjoyned.</p>
                  <p>Now that a company becomes a Church, by joyning in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, may be made good ſundry wayes; firſt, By plaine Texts of Scripture; as from <hi>Deut. 29. 1, 10, 11, 12, 13. Yee ſtand this day all you before the Lord your God, your Captaines of your Tribes, your El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, your Officers, with all the men of Iſrael,</hi> ver. 10. <hi>That thou ſhouldeſt enter into Covenant with the Lord thy God,</hi> ver. 12. <hi>and he may eſtabliſh thee for a people unto himſelfe,</hi> ver. 13. So that here is plain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y ſhewed, that here was a company, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. and this company were to be eſtabliſhed to be a people unto the Lord, that is to ſay, a Church, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. And this is done by the peoples entring into ſolemne Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with God, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. And therefore a company of people doe become a Church by entring into Covenant with God.</p>
                  <div type="objection">

                     </p>
                     <p>1. This Objection concerns the matter of a Church, but the<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> Covenant is not the materiall cauſe of a Church, but the formall
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:130517:51"/>
cauſe thereof: and for this the Text is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> plaine and expreſſe, that by entring into Covenant with God, a people come to be the Lords people, that is to ſay, his Church.</p>
                     <p>2. If it was of all the people together, the reaſon was becauſe that Church was a nationall Church: now if a nationall Church becomes a Church by entring into ſolemne Covenant with God, then a Congregationall Church becomes a Church by the ſame means; for there is no difference between them in this point.</p>
                     <p>3. Though it was of all the people, we may not ſay it proves that when we looke at the materiall cauſe of a Church, there may be a promiſcuous taking in of all Commers without diſtinction or ſeparation of the precious from the vile; for, firſt, when God took in this Nation to be his people, he ſeparated them from all the Nations of the earth beſides: ſo that there was a diſtinction and ſeparation of ſome from others. Secondly, this generation was generally a generation of beleevers; for it was they that were to enter into the land within a while after; for they were fortie yeares in the Wilderneſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; this Covenant was made in the laſt moneth ſave one of the laſt of thoſe fortie yeares, <hi>Deut.</hi> 1. 3.

                     <p>2. But ſuppoſe there were not pregnant places for it in the New Teſtament, yet it is not enough to prove the ſame unlawfull: for whatſoever Ordinance of the old Teſtament is not repealed in the New Teſtament, as peculiar to the Jewiſh Paedagogie, but was of morall and perpetuall equitie, the ſame bindes us in theſe dayes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and is to be accounted the revealed will of God in all ages, though it be not particularly and expreſſely mentioned in the writings of the New Teſtament, elſe how ſhall we prove it unlawfull for a man to marry his Siſter, or his Aunt? How ſhall we prove it war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable and neceſſary for Magiſtrates to puniſh Sabbath-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, blaſphemy, and Idolatry? How ſhall we prove it lawfull to apply the ſeale of Gods Covenant unto Infants? or to admit wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to eate of the holy things; for the Scriptures of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament doe ſpeake little in theſe caſes; onely the Scriptures of the Old Teſtament doe give direction, and light about them, <hi>Lev<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 18. &amp; 19. Neh. 13. 15. &amp;c. 2 Chron. 15. 16. &amp; 2 King. 23. Gen. 17. 2. &amp; Exod.</hi> 12. 4. 6. And the New Teſtament hath nothing to the contrary, and they are all according to morall equitie and reaſon,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:130517:52"/>
and therefore they are to be obſerved from the Scriptures of the Old Teſtament, as the revealed will of God, though there were nothing expreſſely for them in the New. And the ſame we ſay of the particular in hand. For, that a company ſhould be combined together into one body, in way of Government and ſubjection, by way of mutuall free Covenant; as men doe when they enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Church Eſtate, nothing is more naturall or agreeable to morall equitie; nay, it implyeth a contradiction in the very name of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or freedome, that free-men ſhould take upon them authoritie or power over free men without their free conſent, and voluntary and mutuall Covenant or Engagement. And therefore ſeeing this Covenant is not repealed in the Scriptures of the New Teſtament, the Scriptures of the Old are ſufficient warrant for it.</p>
                     <p>Another Scripture to prove the ſame, is <hi>Deut.</hi> 26. 16, 17, 18. with <hi>Deut. 27. 9. This day the Lord hath commanded thee to doe theſe Statutes and Judgements<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thou ſhalt therefore keepe and doe them, &amp;c. Thou hast avouched the Lord this day to be thy God, and to walke in his wayes, and to keepe his Statutes, &amp;c. And the Lord hath avouched thee this day to be his peculiar people; Take heed and hearken, O Iſrael, this day thou art become the people of the Lord thy God.</hi> This Scripture plainly ſhewes theſe things: 1. That here was the making of a Covenant between God and man; for that avouching of God to them, and them to God, was the making of Covenant, <hi>ver.</hi> 17, 18. 2. This was not of one perſon, but of a company together, the whole people of <hi>Iſrael, 26. 18. &amp;</hi> 27. 9. 3 Here is the effect of this Covenant, that thereby they become the Lords people, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. So that when a company doe enter into holy Covenant with God, they become thereby the Lords people, that is to ſay, his Church. So <hi>Ezech.</hi> 16. 8. proves the ſame likewiſe: <hi>I entred into Covenant with thee, ſaith the Lord, and thou becam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ſt mine.</hi> Here alſo is the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Covenant between the Lord and men; and this Covenant was not perſonall, but of a company; for it was with Hieruſalem, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. which was a whole Citie; it was with them that were mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied as the bud of the feild, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. and it was with them that did proſper into a kingdome, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. and therefore not meant onely of any one particular perſon: And by this Covenant they became the Lords; that is, the Lords Church and people; for it is expreſly ſaid, <hi>I entred into Covenant with thee, and thou becameſt mine.</hi> So that when a company enter into Covenant with God, and God with
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:130517:53"/>
them, they become thereby the Lords Church and people. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>Ezek. 20. 37. I will cauſe you to paſſe under the rod; and I will bring you into the bond of the Covenant.</hi> In which place, there is firſt mention of an holy Covenant. Secondly, This was not of one perſon, but of a company, the whole houſe of Iſrael, <hi>ver.</hi> 30. 39. Thirdly, And this Covenant is called a <hi>Bond,</hi> becauſe it is by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant that a people are bound, and tyed, and knit together, as one Church, all of them unto the Lord, and one unto another; So that the Covenant is the bond of union, by which a company are ſo combined and united, as that they become a Church. It is alſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, how the Lord before he would bring them into this bond of the Covenant, he would <hi>cauſe them to paſſe under the rod;</hi> by which phraſe, as <hi>Junius</hi> upon the place well obſerves, is meant try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and probation; drawne from the manner of Shepheards or owners of Cattell, who went among their ſheepe, or other cattell with a rod, and therewith pointed out ſuch as were for the Lords holy uſe, as <hi>Lev.</hi> 27. 32. And ſo hereby is noted that God would not in the dayes of the Goſpel have men to be brought into his Church hand over head, but he would firſt cauſe them to paſſe under the rod of due tryall and probation; and then ſuch as upon tryall were found to be holy for God, or meete matter for his Church, ſhould ſolemnly enter into Covenant with God, and that Covenant ſhould be the bond that ſhould combine them, and knit them together into one, that ſo they that were many particular perſons, ſhould all become one body, that is to ſay, a Church.</p>
                     <p>And ſo much of the firſt Argument drawne from plaine Texts of Scripture.</p>
                     <p>A ſecond Argument may be taken from the Titles that are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven<note place="margin">Argu. 2.</note> to the Church; as firſt, that the Church is ſaid to be married or eſpouſed unto Chriſt, <hi>Jer. 2. 2. &amp; 3. 14. 2 Cor.</hi> 11. 2. From whence the Argument may be formed thus: If every Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a Church by being married or eſpouſed unto Chriſt, then a company becomes a Church by way of Covenant: But the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is true, therefore the latter is true alſo.</p>
                     <p>The Aſſumption, that a Church becomes a Church by being married unto Chriſt, is plaine from the former Scriptures, where the Church of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> in regard of their entring into Church-Eſtate, are ſaid to be eſpouſed and married unto Chriſt, as a loving and chaſt Virgine to one husband. Which
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:130517:53"/>
ſpirituall marriage between Chriſt and his Church, is alſo taught in the type of the marriage between King <hi>Salomon</hi> and <hi>Pharoahs</hi> daughter, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.</p>
                     <p>The Conſequence of the Propoſition is plaine in reaſon; for there is no marriage but by way of Covenant; no woman becomes a mans wife, but by way of beſtowing her ſelfe in Covenant upon ſuch a man: neither doth a man become an husband, but by the ſame means; and therefore the Scripture ſpeaking of the violation of marriage, calls it a violation of Covenant, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2. 17.</p>

                     <p>2. But properly the marriage is between Chriſt &amp; the Church, and ſo is the Covenant alſo, ſo farre as therein they give up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to Chriſt as unto an head and Lord; as a woman in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of marriage doth give up her ſelfe unto her husband; And the performance of ſuch duties as the Church and the member owe one unto another, is a branch of that marriage-Covenant, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are tyed to Chriſt; for Chriſt himſelfe in his Covenant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, not onely that they ſhould give up themſelves to him, but alſo that they ſhould performe theſe duties one unto another. And accordingly it is ſaid of the Churches in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> that <hi>they gave up themſelves firſt to the Lord, and then to us by the will of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 8. 5. True it is, they doe alſo binde themſelves by Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant one unto another, but in that reſpect the Covenant is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly a brotherly Covenant; like that 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20 8. <hi>Amos</hi> 1. 9. becauſe there the engagement is to one another as brethren, fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-members, and fellow-helpers, and not as to one head or Lord, as it is in reſpect of Chriſt, and therefore in that reſpect it is not ſo properly a marriage-Covenant as it is in reſpect of Chriſt: though duties to one another are promiſed in their Covenant with one another, and alſo in their Covenant with Chriſt. In briefe thus: They promiſe unto Chriſt duties to him, and duties to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther according to him: and ſo their Covenant is a marriage-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with Chriſt: They promiſe alſo to one another, duties to one another, and ſo it is a brotherly Covenant.</p>
                     <p>Another Title given to the Church (which alſo proves that a Church is made by Covenant) is the Title of a Citie, or Citie of God, <hi>Pſal. 87. 3. &amp; 48 1. 8. &amp; 122. 3. Epheſ</hi> 2. 19. The Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment lyeth thus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If a true Church be a Citie of God, then a Church becomes a Church by Covenant: But every true Church is a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of God. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Aſſumption is proved by the Scriptures forealledged. The Conſequence of the Propoſition is plaine in reaſon, for every Citie is united by ſome Covenant among themſelves, the Citizens are received into <hi>jus Civitatis,</hi> or right of Citie priviledges, by ſome
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:130517:54"/>
Covenant or Oath; And therefore it is ſo likewiſe in this Citie of God the Church; and men become Citizens of the Church by ſolemne Covenant.</p>
                     <p>The third Argument may be drawne from the meanes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming<note place="margin">Argu. 3.</note> and reſtoring a Church when it is corrupted, which is by entring into Covenant a new with God, 2 <hi>Chron. 15 10. &amp; 29. 10. &amp; Neh. 9. 38. &amp; 10. 28, 29. Jer.</hi> 50. 4, 5. The reaſon may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken thus: If a Church decayed is to be reſtored and reformed by renuing Covenant with God, then it was inſtituted and erected at the firſt by way of Covenant: The reaſon of which Conſequence is, becauſe abuſes and corruptions are to be reformed by bringing things back to the firſt Inſtitution: Thus Chriſt reformes the abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of marriage, by bringing them to the firſt Inſtitution of that Ordinance; <hi>From the beginning it was not ſo,</hi> Mat. 19 8. And thus <hi>Paul</hi> reformeth the Abuſes of the Lords Supper, by telling them what was the firſt Inſtitution thereof, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 23, &amp;c. And thus the Lord Jeſus calling on the declining Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, <hi>bids her remember from whence ſhee is fallen, and repent and doe her firſt workes,</hi> Rev. 2. 5.</p>
                     <p>Now the Aſſumption is plaine from the Texts above alledged, that at the reforming of a Church, there is to be a renuing of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; and thence it follows, that at the firſt erecting of a Church, there was the making of a Covenant with God, for els this renu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Covenant would not have been the way to reforme it.</p>
                     <p>The fourth Argument is taken from that which doth diſſolve<note place="margin">Argu. 4.</note> a Church, which is the diſſolving or breaking of the Covenant, <hi>Zach.</hi> 11. 9, 10, 14. If diſſolving the Covenant be that which doth diſſolve the Church, then the making of Covenant is that which conſtitutes a Church. The reaſon of the Conſequence is plaine, becauſe otherwiſe the Covenant might be diſſolved &amp; the Church ſtand ſtill, if it were not the making of the Covenant that did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute the Church: But if diſſipating ſtones in a building doe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the houſe, then the compacting and conjoyning of them is that which makes the houſe; If ſeparation of ſoule and body be that which deſtroyes the man, that then we ſay he is not: it muſt needs be the uniting of them, that did conſtitute &amp; make the man: and ſo it is in this caſe. And that diſſolving the Covenant is that which diſſolves a Church, is plaine from the Text alledged, <hi>Zach.</hi> 11. where the breaking of the two ſtaves, of beautie and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:130517:55"/>
bands, that is, the unchurching of the Jewes, is interpreted to be the breaking of the Covenant that God had made with that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the brotherhood that was between <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The fifth Argument is taken from the diſtinction which God<note place="margin">Argu. 5.</note> hath appointed amongſt Churches, and the confounding of all Churches into one, if there be not this Covenant to diſtinguiſh them. If Churches be diſtinct Societies, and may not be confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, then Churches are compacted and combined by Covenant: But the former is true. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That Churches are diſtinct Societies, is plaine in the Scripture, where we have mention of many Churches in one Countrey or Province, <hi>Gal. 1. 1. 1 Theſ.</hi> 2. 14. Of ſeven Churches in Aſia, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 4. and of all the Churches, 1 <hi>Cor. 14. 33. Rev. 2. 23. Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> is not <hi>Smyrna,</hi> nor <hi>Smyrna</hi> is not <hi>Thyatira,</hi> nor either of them <hi>Pergamus,</hi> but each one diſtinct of themſelves, having Officers of their owne, which did not belong to others: vertues of their owne for which others are not praiſed, corruptions of their owne, for which others are not blamed; If it were not thus, then when <hi>Lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicea</hi> is condemned for lukewarmeneſſe, or <hi>Epheſus</hi> for declining, all the reſt ſhould be reproved alſo: And when <hi>Philadelfia</hi> is prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, all the reſt ſhould be praiſed alſo, which we ſee is otherwiſe. Now from hence the Conſequence is certaine, that therefore they are combined by ſome Covenant each one amongſt themſelves; for there is nothing els without this that wil ſufficiently diſtinguiſh them. The Spirit of God and Faith in their hearts, is common to all Chriſtians under heaven, and in heaven alſo, and therefore this is not the thing that makes diſtinction. Nor is it habitation in the ſame Towne together, for that may be common to ſuch Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans as are not of this Church, and uſually is to many that are no Chriſtians. As it is with Companies in <hi>London;</hi> as the Company of Goldſmiths, &amp;c. that many others dwell in the ſame Towne with them, yea it may be in the ſame ſtreete that are not of their Company: and therefore it is not meerely habitation that doth diſtinguiſh them from others, but ſome combination and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment amongſt themſelves; So it is not habitation in the ſame Towne that diſtinguiſheth Churches, and Church-members from other men, but their mutuall agreement and combination and joyning themſelves together in an holy Covenant with God.</p>

Firſt, That theſe ſtrangers were members of Chriſt, true beleevers, joyned to God by Faith; for it is ſaid, <hi>they have joyned themſelves to the Lord,</hi> v. 3 &amp; v. 6. that they loved the name of the Lord, ſerved him, and kept his Sabbaths, <hi>v.</hi> 6. and yet for all this they were not as yet joyned as members of the viſible Church, for if they had been joyned, there would have been no cauſe for ſuch a complaint, <hi>the Lord hath ſeparated me from his people,</hi> v. 3. Beſides, bringing them into the Church as members, and granting them the priviledge of members, is promiſed as a reward and bleſſing upon this their joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the Lord by faith and obedience, <hi>v.</hi> 7. And therefore it is not the ſame, but a diſtinct thing from it; the one being promiſed as a reward and bleſſing upon the other. Secondly, The Lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth that he will make them members of his Church: <hi>Them will I bring to my holy mountaine, and make them joyfull in my houſe of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</hi> Thirdly, That among other things requiſite to make them members, this was one, <hi>viz.</hi> the taking hold of that Covenant which was between the Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and God, <hi>v.</hi> 6. So that hence we may gather, that men may be members of Chriſt, joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the Lord by faith and love, and yet for the preſent not be members of the viſible Church: And that when God is ſo graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to true beleevers, as to make them members of his viſible Church, it is requiſite that they joyne in Covenant before.</p>

                     <p>Not ſo, but over and above that, here is alſo meant their open<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> profeſſion of their Faith in the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and open binding of themſelves by Covenant to all ſuch duties of faith and obedience, as God required of the Church of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the members there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Now diſtinctly take the Anſwer to this Objection in three or foure particular Propoſitions. Firſt, There was a Covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and God, <hi>Exod. 19. 5, 6, 7, 8. Ezek 16. 8. Deut. 29. 10. &amp;c.</hi> Secondly, This Covenant was mutuall; not
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:130517:56"/>
onely a promiſe on Gods part to be their God, and to take them for his people, but alſo reciprocally on their part to give up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unto God to be his people, and to doe the dutie of people to their God; The Covenant is not meerely to receive from God, and promiſe nothing back againe to him; nor doth God binde himſelfe therein, and leave men at libertie, but it is mutuall on both parts, as theſe Scriptures declare; <hi>Gen. 17. 1. Exod. 197. 8. Deut. 5. 27. &amp; 26. 16, 17. Hoſ. 2. 23. &amp; Zach.</hi> 13. 9. Thirdly, Hereupon it followes, that if men had not promiſed, and alſo performed, in ſome meaſure of truth, the duties of Faith and obedience unto God, they had not taken hold of the Covenant, but had diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted themſelves, notwithſtanding all the promiſes of God unto their Fathers or others. Thus though God promiſed <hi>Abraham</hi> to be a God to him, and to his ſeede in their generations, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7. yet the <hi>Iſhmaelites</hi> and <hi>Edomites</hi> deſcending from <hi>Abraham,</hi> were diſcovenanted by not promiſing nor performing thoſe duties of Faith and obedience, which God required on the peoples part: when a Covenant containes promiſes on Gods part, and duties al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo on mans, he doth not take hold of the Covenant that takes one part, and leaves another. Fourthly, To beleeve what God promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Covenant for his part, and to promiſe in a private way the duties of obedience on mans part, was not ſufficient to make theſe ſtrangers members of the Church, but they muſt doe it open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and in the view of the Church, elſe the Church could have had no warrant to have admitted ſuch into their Fellowſhip, if their faith and obedience had not been viſibly profeſſed, <hi>Exod. 12. 43. 48 2 Chron.</hi> 23. 19.</p>
                     <p>And in as much as the Covenant was mutuall, when theſe ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers did manifeſt their taking hold of the Covenant, they manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted and profeſſed both Faith and obedience, both that they belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved what God promiſed, and that they would be obedient to what he required; If any ſhould have claimed Church-fellowſhip, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I beleeve the promiſes, but would not binde himſelfe to any duties of Evangelicall obedience, this had been a taking hold of the Covenant by the halves, a taking of one part of it in ſeeming and pretence, and a leaving of another; but it would not have been ſufficient to have brought a man into the fellowſhip of the church: Such of the Congregation of <hi>Iſrael</hi> as would not come to <hi>Hieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> to enter into Covenant, were to be ſeparated from the Church
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:130517:57"/>
in the dayes of <hi>Ezra, Ezra</hi> 10. 8. And therefore ſuch as being ſtrangers ſhould refuſe to enter into it, could not be admitted into the Church; So that the taking hold of Gods Covenant, which is there required to make theſe ſtrangers members of the Church, is a beleeving in heart on the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and an open profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that they did beleeve, and likewiſe a promiſe of obedience or ſubjection unto the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and an open profeſſing of ſuch obedience and ſubjection; and that is the joyning in Covenant which we ſtand for, before a man can be a member of a Church, even an open profeſſion of Faith and of Obedience.</p>
                     <p>A third Argument is taken from thoſe Scriptures which ſhew<note place="margin">Argu. 3.</note> that men become members by being added to the Church, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing joyned to them, <hi>Act. 2. 47. &amp; 5. 13. &amp;</hi> 9. 26. If men become members of the Church by being added or joyned, then joyning in Covenant (or profeſſing of ſubjection to the Goſpel or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of God) is that whereby a man becomes a member of a Church: But the former is true, as appeares by the Scriptures fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, and therefore the latter is true alſo.</p>
                     <p>But all the doubt in this Argument will be concerning the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of the <hi>Major</hi> Propoſition; but that may be made good by this reaſon, and the confirmation of it, <hi>viz.</hi> that a man cannot be added or joyned to the Church by any other meanes without this joyning in Covenant. The truth of which Aſſertion will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by ſhewing the inſufficiency of all other means, without this joyning in Covenant, and that may be done in Anſwer to the Objections enſuing.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>This cannot be all; for, firſt, <hi>Saul</hi> was converted and had faith<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> wrought in his heart, and yet he was not at the firſt received for a member of the Church at <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> (though he aſſayed to be joyned unto them,) till they were better ſatisfied in his ſpirituall eſtate by the teſtimony of <hi>Barnabas,</hi> Act. 9. 26, 27, 28. And thoſe ſtrangers, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56. (as was ſaid before) were joyned to the Lord by being converted, and having Faith wrought in their hearts, and yet they doe lament it with griefe, that they were not joyned as members to the viſible Church: <hi>The Lord hath ſeparated me from his people,</hi> ſay they, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. The old ſaying is true concerning the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:130517:57"/>
viſible Church, <hi>There are many wolves within, and many ſheepe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out.</hi> Secondly, Thoſe that were joyned were beleevers before they joyned; for it is ſaid, <hi>divers were added,</hi> ver. 14. Thirdly, Thoſe that were added to the Church, were added and joyned to them by ſuch an act as others durſt not put forth, <hi>Act. 5. 13. Of the reſt durſt no man joyne unto them,</hi> and therefore it was not by the irreſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable act of God in converting of them, but by ſome voluntary act of their owne choice and conſent; for Gods converting grace depends not upon mans daring, or not daring to receive it. If to be joyned be no more but to be converted, then when it is ſaid, <hi>Some durſt not be joyned,</hi> the meaning ſhould be, they durſt not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, nor ſuffer Faith to be wrought in them; which is groſſe Arminianiſme, ſuſpending the converting grace of God upon the free will of the creature. Fourthly, And as this joyning which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers durſt not doe, cannot be meant of being converted; So if it be well conſidered, what the thing was wherein they durſt not joyne, it may appeare that it was nothing els but this, that they durſt not agree, and engage themſelves to be of their body and ſocietie; that is, they durſt not joyne in Covenant with them. For it cannot be meant of dwelling in the Towne with them, for this they both durſt doe and did: nor is it onely of joyning to heare the Word in their aſſembly, for this alſo they durſt doe, and many did it in great multitudes, ſo that many by hearing the Word became beleevers, and were added to the Lord both of men and women, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. at this very time when it is ſaid of ſome they durſt not joyne unto them: Nor is it of joyning to them in affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or approbation of their way, for this they alſo durſt doe and did expreſſe ſo much in magnifying and commending them, when yet they durſt not joyne unto them, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. Which magnifying of them doth imply that they heard their doctrine, and ſaw their practiſe, and approved it, and highly commended them for the ſame: Wherefore ſeeing this joyning, which ſome durſt not doe, cannot be meant of being converted, nor of joyning in habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor of joyning in affection, nor in hearing the Word in their Aſſembly, nor of approbation, and expreſſions that way, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth that it muſt be meant of joyning in that neere relation of Church-fellowſhip amongſt them, ſo as to be engaged by volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary conſent and agreement to be members of their Church. Fiftly, If joyning to the Church, were no more but to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:130517:58"/>
then he that were converted were joyned as a member of every viſible Church throughout the world, which were a great confuſion of that Order, and diſtinction of Churches, which the Lord hath appointed.</p>

Wherefore ſeeing neither converſion, nor loving affection, nor cohabitation, nor coming into their meetings, doth joyne a man as a member of the viſible Church (for ſome men have all theſe, and yet are not members, and others are ſometimes members of the viſible Churches, and yet want ſome of theſe, are hypocrites and want ſound converſion) it remaineth therefore that as ſound converſion makes a man fit matter for a Church; So profeſſion of his Faith, and of his ſubjection to the Goſpel, and the Churches approbation, and acceptance of him (which is the ſumme of Church-Covenant) is the formall cauſe that gives him the being of a member.</p>

Or when Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters or Maſons doe joyne pieces of ſtone or Timber together, to make one houſe, <hi>Neh. 4. 6.

But when joyning is uſed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe ſuch joyning, wherein a man voluntarily takes on him a new relation, there it alwayes implyes a Covenant, whether the relation be morall and civill, or religious and Eccleſiaſticall: We ſpeake of voluntary relation, for there are naturall relations, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene parents and children: and theſe need no Covenant, there is no Covenant to make a man a Parent, or a childe; There are alſo violent relations, as between Conquerour and Captives, and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:130517:59"/>
in theſe there is no Covenant neither; but others are voluntary, and theſe alwayes imply a Covenant, and are founded therein, whether they be morall and civill (as between husband and wife, <hi>Pro.</hi> 2. 17. between Maſter and ſervants, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. 15. between Prince and ſubject, between Partners in Trade, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 20. 35, 36, 37. where the Covenant or agreement is, that men ſhall bare ſuch a ſhare of charges, and receive ſuch a ſhare of profits:) or religious, as between Miniſter and people, between the Church and the members: all theſe are done by way of Covenant. A man cannot joyne himſelfe to a woman as her husband, but by way of Covenant: A man cannot joyne himſelfe to another as a ſervant, or apprentiſe, but by way of Covenant; And ſo may we ſay of all the reſt; nor into any body corporate, but by the ſame way and means. If men be united into a body politick or incorporate, a man cannot be ſaid to be joyned to them by meere heartie affection, unleſſe withall he joynes himſelfe unto them by ſome Contract or Covenant. Now of this nature is every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church, a body incorporate, 1 <hi>Cor. 12. 27.

                     <p>All voluntary relations, all relations which are neither naturall<note place="margin">Argu. 4.</note> nor violent, are entred into by way of Covenant.</p>
                     <p>But he that joynes into a Church as a member, or enters into a Church, doth take upon him ſuch a relation; Therefore joyning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to a Church as a member, is by way of Covenant.</p>
                     <p>A fifth Argument may be drawne from the power which all<note place="margin">Argu. 5.</note> Churches, Officers and members, have over all their members in the Lord. If all Churches, Officers, and members, have power in the Lord over all their members, then joyning in Covenant is neceſſary to make a man a member of a Church, but the former is true, therefore the latter is true alſo.</p>
                     <p>The Aſſumption in this Argument, that all Churches have power over their members, is proved from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 4, 5. 13. where the Apoſtle reproveth the <hi>Corinthians</hi> for ſuffering the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtuous
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:130517:59"/>
man amongſt them, and commands them to deliver him to Satan, and caſt him out from amongſt them. Now this he would not have done, if they had had no power over him, or if there had been any roome for them to ſay, wee have nothing to doe with him, wee have no power over him. And the ſame is prooved in other Scriptures alſo; as, <hi>Mat. 18. 17. Pſal.</hi> 149. 6. 7, 8, 9.</p>
                     <p>And the Conſequence of the <hi>Major</hi> Propoſition, <hi>viz.</hi> that then members doe engage themſelves by Covenant, is proved by this reaſon; That Churches have no power over ſuch as have not engaged themſelves by Covenant, and committed power unto them, by profeſſing to be ſubject to all the Ordinances of Chriſt amongſt them.</p>
                     <p>The truth whereof may appeare by two Reaſons:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Becauſe all Chriſtians have power and right, <hi>jure divino,</hi> to chooſe their owne Officers to whom they commit their ſoules, <hi>Act. 6. &amp; 1. &amp;</hi> 14. 23. where the word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, imports choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing by Election: and ſo the word is uſed and tranſlated, 2 <hi>Cor. 8. 19. he was choſen by the Churches, &amp;c.</hi> It is not miniſteriall gifts that makes a man a Miniſter to every Church, nor inveſteth him with ſpirituall power over them, nor though he dwell amongſt them, unleſſe they call him, and he accept of that call: And as they have power to chooſe their Officers, ſo likewiſe to chooſe their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren according to God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 1. Now if they have power to chooſe their Officers and brethren, then none can have power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them as Officers and brethren, without their owne conſent, and whom they never choſe, nor promiſed by any Covenant or Engagement to be ſubject to the Lord.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, If the Church ſhould exerciſe any Act of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power over ſuch a man as never entred into Covenant with them (ſuppoſe to Excommunicate him for whoredome or drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or the like) the man might proteſt againſt their Act, and their Sentence, as <hi>Coram non judice,</hi> and they could not juſtifie their proceedings, if indeed there have paſſed no Covenant or Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between him and them. If he ſhall ſay, you have nothing to doe to paſſe Sentence or Cenſure upon me, I am none of your Church, but of another Church; Suppoſe in <hi>Holland,</hi> in <hi>France, &amp;c.</hi> and I am onely here now for Merchandiſe ſake, or upon ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occaſion: what ſhall they ſay to ſtop his mouth, if there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

paſſed any Covenant between him and them.</p>

                     <p>But what is it that makes men Miniſters to ſuch a people, Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> to ſuch a Church, or maketh them ſheepe of my flocke? Is it not thoſe Scriptures that makes every man a Paſtour, or Teacher, or Ruler to a people, unleſſe they call him to that Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; and then in ſo doing they Covenant and Engage themſelves to be ſubject to him in the Lord, and then thoſe Scriptures take hold on them. One might as well ſay, it is not the Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of a wife to her husband that gives him power over her, but the Word of God; For as the Word of God commands people to obey their Miniſters, ſo it commands <hi>wives to be ſubject to their husbands,</hi> Epheſ. 5. 22. And yet all men know, a man cannot take this woman for his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wife but by Covenant. So that if ſhee once makes her ſelfe a wife by her owne voluntary Covenant, then the word of God takes hold on her, and bindes her to doe the duties of a wife: but if ſhee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hath made no Covenant, the man hath no power over her as her husband, neither is ſhee his wife; So if men once make themſelves members of ſuch a Church, ſheepe of ſuch a mans flocke, by their own voluntary Covenant, then the word of God takes hold of them, and bindes them to doe the duties of members to their fellow-brethren, and of people to their Paſtours or Miniſters. But if they never choſe ſuch a man to be their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, nor Covenanted to be ſubject to him in the Lord, he then can have no power over them as a Miniſter unto them, becauſe they have right to choſe their owne Miniſters.</p>
                     <p>A ſixth Argument may be taken from the diſtinction that is<note place="margin">Argu. 6.</note> between members, and not members. If there be by the word of God a diſtinction, between members of the Church and ſuch as are no members, then joyning in Covenant is neceſſary to the being of a member; but the former is true, as appeares 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 12. Some are within, and may be judged by the Church, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are without, and may not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore the latter is true alſo. And the reaſon of the Conſequence is becauſe there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe without this joyning in Covenant, that can ſufficiently diſtinguiſh them; It is not Faith and Grace in their hearts, for ſome men are members of the viſible Church, and yet have no
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:130517:60"/>
Grace, and others may have Grace, and yet be no members, and therefore this is not the thing that doth diſtinguiſh them, nor is it affection, nor cohabitation, nor every approbation of the Word of God, and the wayes of his Church, nor comming into their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies to heare the Word; But theſe things were touched be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and therefore may be here the more briefly paſſed over.</p>
                     <p>And ſo much ſhall ſuffice to have ſpoken of the ſecond particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, concerning the uſe of Church-Covenant, that it is by joyning therein that a particular perſon becomes a member of a Church.</p>
                     <p>But here it will be needfull to remove ſundry Objections, which may ſeeme to ſome to be of great weight againſt Church-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, that ſo by the removing of them, the truth may be the more cleared, to fuller ſatisfaction, if it be the will of God.</p>

                     <p>Secondly, But ſeeing the Covenant is between the Lord and his Church, as the two parties that are confederate, it is all one whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be called the Lords Covenant, or the Church-Covenant: As when <hi>Mamre, Aver, &amp; Eſchol</hi> were confederate with <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 14. 13. might not one truely ſay, <hi>Abraham</hi> was confederate with them?

                     <p>Fourthly, There is good reaſon for both the words; both the Lords Covenant, and the Church-Covenant, becauſe both are confederate; And for that of Church-Covenant, there is this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon alſo, <hi>viz.</hi> to diſtinguiſh it from other Covenants, as a marriage-Covenant, <hi>Pro.</hi> 2. 17. and a brotherly Covenant, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20. 8.

1. A ſecond Covenant doth argue that the firſt was not fault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> where the Covenants are contrary one to another, as the covenant of Grace, and the covenant of works are, and ſo it is moſt true, that the bringing in of the free Covenant of Grace did argue that righteouſnes and life could not be attained by the Law, or Covenant of works; for if there had been a Law given which could have given life, verily righteouſneſſe ſhould have been by the Law. <hi>Gal. 3. 21. Rom.</hi> 8. 3.</p>
                     <p>2. But if it be the ſame Covenant that is renewed or made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, though upon a new occaſion, no man can ſay that entring into the ſame the ſecond time, or a third, or a fourth, doth diſanull the firſt, or caſt diſparagement upon the ſame.

And the like we ſay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Church-Covenant, or the Covenant which a man makes when he enters into the Church, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is not another Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant contrary to the Covenant of Grace, which every beleever is brought into at his firſt converſion, but an open profeſſion of a mans ſubjection to that very Covenant, ſpecially in the things which concerne Church eſtate, into which eſtate the man is now entring.</p>

And ſurely there is ſmal hope that ſuch would yeeld ſubjection and obedience to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, who do refuſe to profeſſe or promiſe it.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, that 3000. were not ſo many, but that joyning in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant might eaſily be done by them all, in one day. For, 1. it was at Penticoſt, at which time of the yeer the dayes were at the longeſt: And, 2. the Scripture tels us, that <hi>David</hi> made a Covenant with all the Tribes of Iſrael in one day, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 5 1, 2, 3. The Articles of the covenant betweene <hi>David</hi> and the Tribes, and ſo betweene this 3000. and the Lord might be openly declared, and they both the one and the other might by ſome ſigne or other, expreſſe their conſent thereunto in one day.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, as joyning in Covenant is a thing that might be done, ſo it is more then probable that indeed it was done, by thoſe 3000. ſoules For it is ſaid, <hi>ver. 41. that they gladly received the word,</hi> that is, they openly profeſſed that they did with all their hearts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, for this receiving of the Word is noted as a condition, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which they were admitted to baptiſme, and therefore it was not onely an inward receiving of it in their hearts, but alſo an open profeſſing that they did receive it; for an inward receiving of it in their hearts, without an open profeſſing thereof outwardly, would not have been ſufficient for the admitting of them unto Baptiſme.
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:130517:62"/>
Now this Word which they received was an exhortation to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance for ſinne, and to Faith in the promiſe, <hi>ver.</hi> 38 39. and to obedience in ſevering themſelves from others, and ſaving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from that untoward generation, <hi>ver.</hi> 40. And therefore when they openly profeſſed, that they gladly received this word, there was an open profeſſing of their Repentance for ſinne, <hi>ver.</hi> 40. of their Faith in the promiſe, and of obedience to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, which is nothing elſe, but the very ſumme of Church-Covenant: yea, and further, their very preparation to this repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, faith and obedience, in that true compunction and ſorrow of ſoul, was alſo openly made manifeſt. <hi>ver.</hi> 37.</p>

                     <p>When the thing is certaine, as was ſhewed before, that they did<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> openly profeſſe repentance, faith and obedience, it is not difference in the length or largeneſſe of their ſpeeches in expreſſing of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that can make any difference in the thing: <hi>Majus &amp; minus non diverſificant ſpeciem.</hi> And we denie not but they might be briefer, becauſe there was not ſuch need they ſhould be long in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of ſome difference betweene them and us, their time and ours: Firſt there were the Apoſtles preſent to heare their confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to judge thereof, who were men of very good diſcerning, and therefore briefer expreſſing of mens ſelves might ſuffice; whereas the beſt Chriſtians, yea the beſt Miniſters amongſt us are not to be compared to the Apoſtles; and therefore as we need more time for ſtudy, and for preparation for our Sermons then they did: ſo likewiſe we need more time to heare, and try the ſoundneſſe of mens repentance towards God, and faith towards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Yet this we may adde withall, that if the Apoſtles and thoſe primative Chriſtians, men of ſuch excellent diſcerning were ſometimes deceived, and could not alwayes ſo diſcern, but that ſome Hypocrites would creep into the Church: as the example of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> doth witneſſe; how much more need is there, that the Churches of God in theſe dayes (being far inferiour to them) ſhould be very watchfull and circumſpect in
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:130517:63"/>
trying the ſpirituall eſtates of them that offer to come into the Church?</p>
                     <p>Secondly, their times alſo differed from ours: for their Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anitie was a matter of reproach and danger of excommunication, <hi>Joh.</hi> 9. 22. of impriſonment, <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 3. and 5. 18. and the like. And therefore to ſee men now to make open profeſſion of their faith in Chriſt Jeſus, whoſe ſervants and diſciples were ſo hated, and who himſelfe but a while before was crucified, this was not an ordinarie matter: and therefore in words, men might be the briefer when they came to be received into the Church: But our times in <hi>New England</hi> do not perſecute Chriſt, and Chriſtians, and Chriſtian Churches, but countenance them, and protect them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is more need now to be more ſtudious in examination of mens eſtates when they offer themſelves for Church members: when the Jews were in favour, many of the people of the Land be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Jews, <hi>Eſth.</hi> 8. 17.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>1. Suppoſe the New Teſtament ſaid nothing of it, yet it might<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> have ground ſufficient from the Scriptures of the old Teſtament; for if it was Gods revealed will in thoſe dayes, that a companie ſhould become a Church, and particular perſons become members of that Church by way of Covenant, we may be ſure it is ſo now likewiſe, unleſſe covenanting were peculiar to the Jewiſh Paedigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie; indeed if it had never been uſed in thoſe times, but were ſome new ordinance, peculiar to the dayes of the New Teſtament, in ſuch caſes alſo a ground from the Scriptures of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were neceſſarie, as there is in all ſuch things wherein there is any change or variation, from what was uſed in thoſe times afore Chriſt, as that there ſhould not be Nationall Churches, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregationall, and not one viſible Church, but many, that there ſhould be baptiſme, and the Lords Supper: theſe are matters that are not found in the old Teſtament, nor were appointed to be uſed in thoſe dayes, and therefore we muſt have warrant for them in the New, and ſo we have. But for the Covenant it is otherwiſe, it is no new ordinance peculiar to the dayes of the Goſpel, nor any Leviticall ordinance peculiar to the Jewiſh Pedigogie; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Scriptures of the Old Teſtament that give warrant for it, may be ſufficient as hath been ſhewed afore.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="31" facs="tcp:130517:63"/>2. And yet there is not wanting good warrant for it, that it ought to be uſed, in the dayes of the New Teſtament. For, 1. the Prophets do foretell it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56. 6, 7. and 44. 5. and <hi>Jer. 50. 5. Ezek.</hi> 20. 37. and in ſundrie other places, to omit the reſt at this time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome of them have been ſpoken of before; Onely let thoſe words of <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44. 5. be well conſidered, and ſee if they do not plainly hold forth that in the dayes of the New Teſtament, men ſhould openly profeſſe their faith, and ſolemnly bind themſelves by Covenant, to be the Lords people, one ſhall ſay, I am the Lords, and another ſhall call himſelf by the name of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and another ſhall ſubſcribe with his hand, and ſirname himſelf by the name of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Theſe words are ſo plaine for open profeſſing of faith in the Lord, and open binding of mens ſelves by Covenant unto him, as we conceive nothing need be more.</p>
                     <p>2. The Apoſtles do ſufficiently teſtifie, that ſuch a thing was practiſed in their dayes, elſe how ſhould we underſtand that fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip in the Goſpel in its full latitude and breadth, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 5. if this combining into Church-fellowſhip be no part thereof; yea when it is ſaid, <hi>they continued ſtedfaſtly,</hi> or as the word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, may well be tranſlated, <hi>they ſtrongly did cleave together,</hi> or hold together in ſuch a Fellowſhip, which was not preaching and hearing the doctrine of the Apoſtles, nor Sacraments, nor Prayer, but a thing diſtinct from all theſe. If this combining themſelves into a ſpirituall fellowſhip and ſocietie of Church-ſtate be no part thereof, we know not how to underſtand it, nor what that fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſhould meane; If Doctrine, and Sacraments, and Prayer had not been particularly mentioned, in the ſame place, it might have been thought that the Fellowſhip in which they ſo ſteadfaſtly clave together had been no more, but their coming together to obſerve theſe ſaid ordinances, and their communion therein. But when all theſe are particularly mentioned, and Fellowſhip menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned among them, as a thing diſtinct from the reſt, we may not confound it with the reſt. We might as well ſay, that by doctrine is meant Sacraments, and by Sacraments is meant Prayer; as to ſay that by Fellowſhip is meant nothing elſe but the exerciſe of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and Sacraments, and Prayer. And if theſe as they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly named, be diſtinct ordinances, and may not be confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, then Fellowſhip being named in the ſame manner imports ſomething diſtinct from them all, and may not be confounded
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:130517:64"/>
with them, nor with any of them, no more then the other may be confounded one with another. And if ſo, then as this Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip may import, the communion of their gift and goods one for the helpe of another, ſo it muſt firſt of all imply a combining of themſelves into Church-ſtate by mutuall agreement, conſent, or covenant.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, when the Apoſtle writeth, that by experience of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> liberall contribution to the poore Saints, men glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified God for their profeſſed ſubjection to the Goſpel of Chriſt, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 13. he plainly imployes thereby, that the <hi>Corinthians</hi> had made a profeſſion or promiſe of ſuch ſubjection to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel as did comprehend this particular of diſtributing to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie of the Saints, among other things. And their liberall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution which he there ſpeaks of, was looked at as one point of their reall performance of that ſubjection to the Goſpel, which they had before profeſſed, and promiſed. Now the Church-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is nothing elſe, but the profeſſing or promiſing of ſuch ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, and therefore this place is another proofe of Church-Covenant. Beſides, it hath been ſhewed afore in <hi>Argument</hi> 3. that thoſe places which ſpeake of being added to the Church, of joyning, or aſſaying to joyne unto the Church, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 47. and 5 13. and 9 26. are not expounded according to the full meaning of them, when they are underſtood of any other joyning, if joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in Covenant be left out. And therefore the Scriptures of the New Teſtament do beare good witneſſe unto Church-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, though, as we ſaid before, the Scriptures of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment might have been ſufficient if the New Teſtament had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken nothing of it.</p>

                     <p>Secondly, And yet they that ſearch the Stories and Writers of the times and ages next after the Apoſtles, may find ſome teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of Church-Covenant in thoſe dayes: For inſtance, <hi>Juſtine Martyr</hi> in his Apol. 2. makes mention of three things which were required of all that were admitted into the Church as members, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, that is regeneration, and ſoundneſſe in the Faith, and a promiſe to walke in obedience to the Goſpel. And generally this was the practiſe of all thoſe times, that never any man was admitted to Baptiſme, nor his children neither, but they put him to anſwer three queſtions, <hi>Abrenuntios?</hi> whereto he anſwered, <hi>Abrenuntio. Credis?</hi> whereto his anſwer was, <hi>Credo:</hi> and <hi>Spondes?</hi> to which he anſwered, <hi>Spondes.</hi> So that here was an open declaration of his Repentance from dead works, and of the ſoundneſſe of his Faith, in the two firſt particulars, and an open binding himſelf by covenant or promiſe to walke according to the Goſpel, in the third. But much needs not to be ſaid in this point, unto them that do acknowledge Scripture Antiquitie to be ſufficient, though after times ſhould be found to ſwerve from the Rules and Patterns that are therein contained.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>The reaſons why wee are loath to ſay, that the Congregations in <hi>England</hi> are utterly without a Covenant, are theſe:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Becauſe there were many Chriſtian Churches in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in the Apoſtles time, or within a while after, as Maſter <hi>Fox</hi> ſheweth at large, <hi>Act. &amp; Mon. lib.</hi> 2. beginning <hi>pag</hi> 137. where he reporteth out of <hi>Gildas,</hi> that <hi>England</hi> received the Goſpel in the time of <hi>Tiberius</hi> the Emperour, under whom Chriſt ſuffered, and that <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> was ſent of <hi>Philip</hi> the Apoſtie from <hi>France</hi> to <hi>England</hi> about the yeare of Chriſt 63. and remained in <hi>England</hi> all his time, and ſo he with his fellowes layd the firſt foundation
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:130517:66"/>
of Chriſtian Faith among the Britaine people, and other Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers and Teachers comming afterward, confirmed the ſame and increaſed it. Alſo the ſaid Maſter <hi>Fox</hi> reporteth out of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> that the Goſpel was diſpearſed abroad by the ſound of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles into many Nations, and amongſt the reſt into <hi>Britaine,</hi> yea into the wildeſt places of <hi>Britaine,</hi> which the <hi>Romans</hi> could never attaine unto: and alledgeth alſo out of <hi>Ni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>phorus,</hi> that <hi>Simon Zelotes</hi> did ſpread the Goſpel to the Weſt Ocean, and brought the ſame into the Iles of <hi>Britaine:</hi> and ſundry other proofes he there hath for the ſame point. Now if the Goſpel and Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion were brought into <hi>England</hi> in the Apoſtles times, and by their means, it is like that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Churches were then conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by way of Covenant, becauſe that was the manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting Churches in the Apoſtles time, as alſo in the times aſore Chriſt, as hath been ſhewed from the Scripture before in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. And if Chriſtian Congregations in <hi>England</hi> were in thoſe times combined by Covenant, then eternitie of Gods Covenant is ſuch, that it is not the interpoſition of many corruptions that may ariſe in after times that can diſanull the ſame, except when men wilfully breake Covenant and reject the offers of the Goſpel through obſtinacy, which we perſwade our ſelves they are not come unto: and conſequently the Covenant remaines which hath preſerved the eſſence of Churches to this day; though the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of manifold corruptions, have made the Covenant more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite then were meete.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Becauſe there want no good Records (as may be ſeene in <hi>Seldens Hiſtory of Tithes</hi>) to prove that in former times in <hi>England</hi> it was free for men to pay their Tithes and Oblations where themſelves pleaſed: Now this paying of Tithes was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted as a dutie of people to their Miniſter, or ſheepe to their Paſtour: and therefore ſeeing this was by their owne voluntary agreement and conſent, their joyning to the Church as members thereof, &amp; to the Miniſtery thereof as ſheepe of ſuch a mans flock, was alſo by their owne voluntary agreement and conſent: and this doth imply a Covenant <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> was not the precincts of Pariſhes that did limit men in thoſe dayes, but their owne choice.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Thoſe Queſtions and Anſwers miniſtred at Baptiſme, ſpoken of before, (viz. <hi>Do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ſt thou renounce? I doe renounce: doeſt thou beleeve? I doe beleeve: doeſt thou promiſe? I doe promiſe</hi>) as they
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:130517:67"/>
were uſed in other places, ſo were they alſo in <hi>England,</hi> and are unto this day, though not without the mixture of ſundry corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Now this doth imply a Covenant. And when the children came to age, they were not to be admitted to the Lords Supper, before they had made perſonall Confeſſion of their owne Faith, and ratified the Covenant which was made at their Baptiſme by their Parents, which courſe indeed afterward did grow into a Sacrament of Confirmation, but that was an abuſe of a good Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
                     <p>If here it be ſaid, that the Members of the Pariſhionall Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies are not brought in by their owne voluntary profeſſion, but by the Authority and Proclamation of the Prince, and therefore they have no ſuch Covenant.</p>
                     <p>The Anſwer is, that the Chriſtian Prince doth but his dutie when he doth not tollerate within his Dominions any open Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, or the open worſhip of falſe Gods by baptized perſons, but ſuppreſſeth the ſame: and likewiſe when he gives free libertie to the exerciſe of all the Ordinances of true Religion, according to the minde of Chriſt, with countenance alſo and encouragement unto all thoſe whoſe hearts are willingly bent thereunto, <hi>Ezra. 1. 1. 3. &amp;</hi> 7. 13. And therefore this practiſe of his cannot overthrow the freeneſſe of mens ioyning in Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Communion, becauſe one dutie cannot oppoſe nor contradict another. And ſuppoſe that this courſe of the Magiſtrate ſhould ſeeme to be a forcing of ſome to come in for members who were unfit, (in which caſe it were not juſtifiable) yet this doth not hinder the voluntary ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of others, who with all their hearts deſired it. When the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> departed out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> there went a mixed multitude with them, many going with them that were not <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. And in the dayes of <hi>Mordecay</hi> and <hi>Heſther,</hi> many of the people of the lands became <hi>Jewes,</hi> when the <hi>Jewes</hi> were in favour and reſpect, <hi>Eſt.</hi> 8. 17. and ſo joyned to them not of their owne voluntary minde, nor of any ſincere heart towards God, but meerely for the favour or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eare of men; yet this forced or ſeined joyning of ſome could not hinder thoſe that were <hi>Iſraelites</hi> indeed from being <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> nor make the <hi>Jewes</hi> to be no <hi>Jewes,</hi> no Church-members.</p>
                     <p>And the ſame may be ſaid in this caſe, Suppoſe the Magiſtrates Proclamation ſhould be a cauſe, or an occaſion rather, of bringing
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:130517:67"/>
ſome into the Church, who came not of their owne voluntary minde, but for feare, or for obteining favour, yet this cannot hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but others might voluntarily and freely Covenant to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Goſpel of Chriſt: Such ſubjection and the promiſe of it being the thing which themſelves did heartily deſire, though the Magiſtrate ſhould have ſaid nothing in it.</p>
                     <p>If any ſhall hereupon inferre, that if the Pariſhionall Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies be Churches, then the members of them may be admitted to Church priviledges in <hi>New England,</hi> before they joyne to our Churches: Such one may finde his Anſwer in the Anſwer to the tenth of the thirty-two Queſtions; Whereunto we doe referre the Reader for this point. Onely adding this, that this were contrary to the judgement and practiſe of the Reformed Churches, who doe not admit a man for member without perſonall profeſſion of his Faith, and joyning in Covenant, though he had formerly been a member of a Church in another place, as was ſhewed before out of Maſter <hi>Parker.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Laſtly, If any ſay, that if theſe reaſons prove the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations to have ſuch a Covenant as proves them to be Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, then why may not <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Aſſemblies of Papiſts goe for true Churches alſo? For ſome man may thinke that the ſame things may be ſaid for them that here in Anſwer to this eleventh Objection are ſaid for the Pariſhes in <hi>England:</hi> Such one muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member two things: firſt, that we doe not ſay ſimply, a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant makes a company a true Church, but (as was ſaid before) a Covenant to walke in ſuch wayes of worſhip to God and edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of one another, as the Goſpel of Chriſt requireth. For who doubts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but there may be an agreement among theeves, <hi>Pro.</hi> 1. A confederation among Gods enemies, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 83. A conſpiracy among the <hi>Arabians,</hi> the <hi>Ammonites</hi> and <hi>Aſhdodites,</hi> to hinder the building of <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> Neh. 4. 7, 8. And yet none of theſe are made true Churches by ſuch kind of confederacies or agreements. And ſo wee may ſay of the Aſſemblies of Papiſts, eſpecially ſince the Counſell of <hi>Trent.</hi> If there be any agreement or confederacy among them, it is not to walke in the wayes of the Goſpell, but in wayes contrary to the fundamentall truths of the Goſpel, as Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry in worſhip, Hereſie in doctrine, and other Antichriſtian pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions and corruptions: and therefore if they combined in theſe things, ſuch combinations will never prove them true Churches.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:130517:68"/>
The Church is the Pillar and ground of truth, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15. But the Religion of Papiſts is ſo farre from truth, that whoſoever li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth and beleeveth according to it, without repentance, cannot be ſaved. Witneſſe their doctrine in the point of vilifying the Scriptures, and in point of free-will, and of Juſtification by works, of the Popes Supremacy, of the Sacrifice of the Maſſe, of worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of Images, &amp;c. In regard of which, and ſuch like, the Holy Ghoſt ſaith, that their Religion is a Sea, <hi>become as the bloud of a dead man, and every ſoule in that Sea dyeth,</hi> Rev. 16. 3. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore agreement in ſuch a Religion will never prove them to be true Churches; nor any Aſſemblies of Arrians, Antitrinitaries, Anabaptiſts, or Fameliſts, ſuppoſing them alſo to be combined by Covenant among themſelves.</p>
                     <p>But now for the Aſſemblies in <hi>England,</hi> the caſe is farre other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; for the Doctrine of the Articles of Religion which they profeſſe, and which they promiſe to hold and obſerve (though ſome things are amiſſe in ſome of thoſe Articles, and though ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perſons live contrary in their lives) yet the doctrine is ſuch that whoſoever beleeveth, and liveth according to it, ſhall undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be ſaved, and many thouſands have been ſaved therein<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore Aſſemblies united by Covenant to obſerve this doctrine may be true Churches, when the Aſſemblies of Papiſts and others may be falſe, although they alſo were combined by Covenant: the reaſon of the difference riſing from the difference that is in the doctrine and Religion which they ſeverally profeſſe, and by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant binde themſelves to obſerve, the one being fundamentally corrupt, and conſequently pernicious: The other in the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall points Orthodoxall and ſound.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, It muſt be remembred alſo (which was intimated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) that if fundamentall corruptions be profeſſed in with impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitency and obſtinacy, then God may diſanull the Covenant on his part, and give a Bill of divorce to ſuch a people, <hi>Jere.</hi> 3. 8. Now experience and the Scripture alſo doth witneſſe of the Jeſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and <hi>Trent</hi>-Papiſts, that they repented not of the workes of their hands, of worſhipping Devills, and Idolls of Gold, &amp;c. nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther repented they of their murthers, nor of their ſorceries, nor of their fornications, nor of their thefts, <hi>Rev.</hi> 9. 20, 21.</p>
                     <p>But now for the Pariſh Aſſemblies in <hi>England,</hi> we hope that we may ſafely ſay, they doe not ſinne of obſtinacy, but of ignorance,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:130517:68"/>
having not been convinced (and many of them never having had means to be convinced) of the corruptions that are amongſt them, in reſpect of their conſtitution, and worſhip, and Miniſtery, and ſo the Covenant remaining among them, may prove them to be Churches, when it cannot ſtand the Papiſts in like ſtead, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impenitent and obſtinate: Which we doe not ſpeake to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie the Pariſhes altogether, as if there were not dangerous cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions found in them, nay rather (the Lord be mercifull to the ſinnes of his people) wee may lament it with teares, that in reſpect of their members and Miniſtery, in reſpect of their worſhip and walkings, in many of thoſe Aſſemblies there are found ſuch appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent corruptions, as are juſtly grievous to a godly ſoule, that is enlightened to diſcerne them, and greatly diſpleaſing to the Lord, and indeed had need to be repented of betime, leaſt otherwiſe the Lord remove the Candleſticke and unchurch them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 5. In a word, the corruptions remaining are juſt cauſes of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and humiliation: but yet in as much as the Articles of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which they profeſſe, containe ſuch wholeſome doctrine, that whoſoever beleeveth and walketh according thereunto, in ſinceritie, ſhall undoubtedly be ſaved, and in as much as the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions are not perſiſted in with obſtinacy, therefore wee deny not but they have the truth of Churches remaining.</p>

Church, though perhaps there be many of them that meete<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and live in the ſame place, unleſſe they be joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by ſome ſpeciall bond amongſt themſelves: for ſo one Church would many times be diſſolved into many, and many Churches confounded into one. Now this bond is a Covenant, either expreſſed or implicite, whereby beleevers do binde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves particularly to performe all ſuch duties, both towards God and mutually to one another, as pertaine to the nature of a Church, and their edification. And thereupon no man is rightly admitted into the Church, but by confeſſion of his Faith, and ſtipulation, or promiſe of obedience.</q>

                     <p>Theſe words doe plainely and fully ſhew his judgement of Church-Covenant, to be the very ſame that is held and practiſed in <hi>New-England</hi> at this day. And that he was not for that ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and regiditie of ſeparation, may be cleared from ſundry of his workes, wherein he plainly and fully beares witneſſe againſt the ſame, and namely, in his <hi>Freſh ſuite againſt Ceremonies, pag.</hi> 207. and in his ſecond <hi>Manuduction,</hi> wherein he purpoſely and at large deales in this Argument of Separation. Sure it is Maſter <hi>Canne</hi> in his Booke, wherein he goes about to prove the neceſſitie of ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Non-Conformiſts principles, doth profeſſedly and expreſſely oppoſe himſelfe againſt Doctor <hi>Ames</hi> in the point of Separation, which ſhewes how farre the good Doctor was from favouring that way, when they moſt zealouſly therein doe count him to be a ſpeciall oppoſite of theirs, as indeed he was. And for Maſter <hi>Parker,</hi> his judgement of Church-Covenant was heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in part; where he ſo much approveth the practiſe of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches in this point. And much more may be ſeene of his judgement herein, in the ſixteenth Chap. of the third booke of his <hi>Polit. Eccleſiaſtica.</hi> And yet in the ſame place, and likewiſe <hi>lib 1. cap.</hi> 13. 14. of the ſame Treatiſe he plentifully and plainly ſhewes his diſlike of the wayes of Separation, as is alſo acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in an Admonition to the Reader, prefixed before that Booke, by <hi>I. R. ſuo, ſuorumque nomine.</hi> So that this Aſſertion ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares to be untrue, wherein it is ſaid, that <hi>none but Browniſts and Separatiſts doe approve of Church-Covenant.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for the Inference from this ground, that therefore Church-Covenant ſhould not be received, becauſe it is pleaded for and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed by the Separatiſts. We Anſwer, that this will not follow,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:130517:69"/>
unleſſe it could be proved, that the Separatiſts hold no truth; or if they hold a truth wee muſt not hold it, that ſo it may appeare wee differ from them; Either of which, it were unreaſonable to affirme. If the Papiſts hold ſundry Articles of Faith, as that there is a unitie of the Divine Eſſence, and Trinitie of Perſons, that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is God and man, and that true Meſſiah that was promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and the onely Saviour of the world, and many ſuch like, muſt wee deny theſe things becauſe they are holden by the Papiſts? This were as unreaſonable as to condemne the doctrine of the Reſurrection, becauſe it was maintained by the Phariſees, <hi>Act.</hi> 23. 8. And ſo we ſay of Church-Covenant, holden and practiſed by them of the Separation; as alſo many other truths are maintained by them: No reaſon that truth ſhould be refuſed, becauſe the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratiſts maintaine it. When Doctor <hi>Bancroft</hi> in a Sermon at <hi>Pauls</hi>-Croſſe, had avouched that the Superioritie of Biſhops a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove other Miniſters, is by Gods owne Ordinance, and to make the contrary opinion odious, affirmed that <hi>Aerius</hi> perſiſting in it, was condemned for an Heretique by the generall conſent of the whole Church, and that <hi>Martin</hi> and his Companions, doe main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the ſame opinion of <hi>Aerius;</hi> What ſaith learned Doctor <hi>Rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds</hi> hereunto, in a Letter to Sir <hi>Francis Knolls,</hi> who required him to ſhew his judgement herein: <q>Touching <hi>Martin,</hi> ſaith he, if any man behave himſelfe otherwiſe then in diſcretion and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie he ought, let the blame be laid where the fault is, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him not; but if by the way he utter a truth, mingled with whatſoever elſe, it is not reaſon that that which is of GOD ſhould be condemned for that which is of man: no more then the doctrine of the Reſurrection ſhould be reproved, becauſe it was maintained and held by the Phariſees: Wherefore remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the odious name of <hi>Martin</hi> from that which is ſinceritie and love, is to be dealt with, &amp;c.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>And the very ſame doe wee ſay to them that would make Church-Covenant to be odious, becauſe it is held by thoſe of the Seperation, who are commonly called Browniſts: If men behave themſelves otherwiſe then they ought, we defend them not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, but if they hold any truth mingled with whatſoever elſe, wee would not have that which is of God to be condemned, for that which is of man: truth ſhould not be refuſed, becauſe of other corruptions that may be found in them that hold it.</p>

                     <p>But ſuppoſe we had never knowne nor practiſed the ſame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our coming into this countrey, yet if it be a truth of God, there is no reaſon why we ſhould ſhut our eyes againſt the light, when God holds it forth unto us, nor that others ſhould be offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at us for receiving the ſame.

                     <p>The time hath been, (and we may be humbled for it) when we lived without God in the world, and ſome of us in many ſinfull courſes: and ſhall any be offended, becauſe we are not ſtill the ſame? and when God called us from the wayes of ſin and death, to the Fellowſhip of his grace in Chriſt; yet ſome of us lived a long time in conformity to the ceremonies impoſed in our native Countrey, and ſaw not the evill of them. But when God did open our eyes, and let us ſee the unlawfulneſſe thereof, we cannot ſee but it would have been a with-holding the truth in unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and a great unthankfulneſſe to God for light revealed to us, if we ſhould ſtill have continued in that courſe through an inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate deſire of ſeeming conſtant: and therefore it is not any juſt cauſe of offence that we have changed our judgement and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe in thoſe things, when we once perceived the Word of God to diſallow them.</p>
