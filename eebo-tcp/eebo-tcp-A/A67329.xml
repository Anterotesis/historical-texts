            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>THIS Country in our Engliſh Language is call'd <hi>Orkney;</hi> by the Latins, both Ancient and Modern, it is call'd <hi>Orcades. Pomponius Mela</hi> writes it with an aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, <hi>Orchades.</hi> What reaſon there is for the Name is not condeſcended up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but it's probable the Latin Name may be from <hi>Orcas,</hi> which <hi>Ptolemy</hi> makes to be a Promontory of <hi>Cathnes</hi> over-againſt this Country, or from ſome
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:102617:10"/>
Colony of the <hi>Picts,</hi> who firſt Planted this Country, and from ſome Similitude with the Name whereby they call'd themſelves, might be ſo call'd by the <hi>Romans.</hi> As for the Engliſh name <hi>Ork<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> it may be derived from ſome Pictiſh Prince, as <hi>Erick</hi> or <hi>Orkenwald,</hi> or ſome other who has been famous in the firſt Plantation; or might have got the name from ſome remarkable Title which the firſt Planters the <hi>Pights</hi> took to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; for <hi>Picts</hi> or <hi>Pights</hi> (as <hi>Verſtegan</hi> ſays) in the Teutonick Tongue ſignifies Fighters; and <hi>Orkney</hi> may come from <hi>Ear,</hi> which ſignifies Honour, and <hi>Kyn,</hi> which ſignifies on Off-ſpring, as if the name were intended to ſhew, That they were an Off-ſpring or Generation of Honour.</p>
            <p>This Country lies in the Northern temperate Zone and thirteenth Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate; the Longitude being 22 De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and 11 Minutes, and Latitude 59 Degrees and 2 Minutes, the Compaſs varying eight Degrees; ſo that the length of the longeſt Day is eighteen Hours and ſome odd Minutes; yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that this Country is ſo far remov'd to the North, the Air is tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate and wholſome, agreeing well
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:102617:10"/>
with thoſe Conſtitutions that can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure a little Cold. At Midnight it is ſo clear for a great part of <hi>June,</hi> that one may read a Letter in his Chamber; yet it cannot be true what <hi>Bleau</hi> reports, That from the Hill of <hi>Hoy</hi> a Man may ſee the Sun at Midnight; for it cannot be the true Body of the Sun that is ſeen, but the Image of it refracted through ſome watry Cloud about the Horizon, ſeeing it muſt be as far depreſſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our Horizon in <hi>June,</hi> as it is elevated above it in <hi>December,</hi> which is by many Degrees; for from that Hill the Sun is to be ſeen in the ſhorteſt Day in <hi>December</hi> above five Hours.</p>
            <p>The Air and Clouds here, by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration of the Sun, do ſometimes gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſeveral things; as ſome Years ſince, ſome Fiſhermen Fiſhing half a League from Land, over-againſt <hi>Copinſha,</hi> in a fair Day, there fell down from the Air a Stone about the bigneſs of a Foot-ball, which fell in the middle of the Boat and ſprung a Leake, to the great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the Lives of the Men that were in it, which could be no other than ſome Subſtance generated in the Clouds. The Stone was like condenſed or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefied
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:102617:11"/>
Clay, and was a long time in the cuſtody of Captain <hi>Andrew Dick,</hi> at that time Steward of this Country; and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Dick,</hi> who is yet alive, told me he gave it to the late Earl of <hi>Glencairn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here the Winters are generally more ſubject to Rain than Snow; nor does the Froſt and Snow continue ſo long here as in other parts of <hi>Scotland,</hi> but the Wind in the mean time will often blow very boiſterouſly, and it Rains ſometimes not by drops but by ſpouts of Water, as if whole Clouds fell down at once. In the Year 1680, in the Month of <hi>June,</hi> after great Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, there fell flakes of Ice near a foot thick.</p>
            <p>This Country is wholly ſurrounded with the Sea, having <hi>Pightland-Firth</hi> on the South, the <hi>Deucaledonian</hi> Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an on the Weſt, the Sea that divides it from <hi>Zetland</hi> on the North, and the German Sea on the Eaſt. <hi>Zetland</hi> ſtands North-Eaſt and by Eaſt from <hi>Orkney,</hi> and from the Start of <hi>Sanda</hi> in <hi>Orkney</hi> to <hi>Swinburg</hi> Head the moſt Southerly Point in <hi>Zetland</hi> is about eighteen leagues, where there is nothing but Sea all the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:102617:11"/>
way, ſave <hi>Fair Iſle,</hi> which lies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in eight Leagues of <hi>Swinburg-Head.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pightland-Firth,</hi> which divides this Country from <hi>Cathnes,</hi> is in breadth from <hi>Duncansbay</hi> in <hi>Cathnes</hi> to the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt point of <hi>South-Ronalſha</hi> in <hi>Orkney</hi> about twelve Miles, in it are a great many different Tides, reckon'd to the number of twenty four, which run with ſuch an impetuous force, that a Ship under ſail is no more able to make way againſt the Tide, than if it were hinder'd by a <hi>Remora,</hi> which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive is the reaſon why ſome have ſaid they have found the <hi>Remora</hi> in theſe Seas.</p>
            <p>In this Firth, about two Miles from the Coaſt of <hi>Cathnes,</hi> lies <hi>Stroma,</hi> a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle pleaſant Iſland, but becauſe of its vicinity to <hi>Cathnes,</hi> and its being ſtill under the Juriſdiction of the Lords of that Country, it is not counted as one of the Iſles of <hi>Orkney.</hi> On the North-ſide of this Iſle is a part of <hi>Pightland-Firth,</hi> call'd the <hi>Swelchie</hi> of <hi>Stroma,</hi> and at the Weſt-end of the Iſle, betwixt it and <hi>Mey</hi> in <hi>Cathnes,</hi> there is another part of the Firth, call'd the <hi>Merry Men of Mey,</hi> both which are very dangerous to Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:102617:12"/>
The Sea ebbs and flows here as in other places, yet there are ſome Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena, the reaſon of which cannot ſo eaſily be found out; as in the Iſle of <hi>Sanda,</hi> it flows two hours ſooner on the Weſt-ſide than it does on the Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide; and in North <hi>Faira</hi> (which lies betwixt <hi>Eda</hi> and <hi>Weſtra)</hi> the Sea ebbs nine hours and flows but three: And at <hi>Hammoneſs</hi> in <hi>Sanda,</hi> both ebb and flood run one way, except at the be ginning of a quick Stream, when for two or three hours the flood runs South.</p>
            <p>The Sea here is very turbulent in a Storm, and uneaſie even to thoſe on Land, eſpecially in thoſe places of the Country that lie expos'd to <hi>Pightland-Firth,</hi> and the Weſtern Ocean, for when the Storm beats that way, the Sea da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes with ſuch violence againſt the Rocks, that a great deal of the Sea is carry'd (in ſome places near a quarter of a mile) on the Land, and falls like a great ſhower of Rain on the Ground, which is very oft prejudicial to their Corn at certain Seaſons.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:102617:12"/>
The Tides alſo are very ſwift and violent, by reaſon of the multitude of the Iſles and narrowneſs of the Paſſage; for, when all the reſt of the Sea is ſmooth, theſe Tides carry their Waves and bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows high, and run with ſuch violence that they cauſe a contrary motion in the Sea adjoyning to the Land, which they call <hi>Eaſter-birth</hi> or <hi>Weſter-birth,</hi> according to its courſe; yet notwithſtanding of the great rapidity of theſe Tides and Births, the Inhabitants, daily almoſt, travel from Iſle to Iſle about their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral affairs in their little Cockboats or Yoals, as they call them.</p>
            <p>Whatever the Ancients have written of the number of the Iſlands of <hi>Orkney,</hi> it's certain there are but twenty ſix, at preſent inhabited, <hi>viz. South-Ronalſha, Swinna, Hoy</hi> and <hi>Waes, Burra, Lamb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holm, Flotta, Faira, Cava, Gramſey, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mona</hi> or <hi>Mainland, Copinſha, Shapinſha, Damſey, Inhallo, Stronſa, Papa-Stronſa, Sanda, North-Ronalſha, Eda, Rouſa, Wyre, Gairſa, Egleſha, North-Faira, Weſtra, Papa-Weſtra.</hi> The reſt of the Iſlands are call'd <hi>Holms,</hi> and are only uſed for Paſture; all of them being ſeparated from one another by ſome narrow
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:102617:13"/>
Streights. Moſt of theſe Iſlands names end in <hi>a</hi> or <hi>ey,</hi> which in the Teutonick ſignifieth Water, to ſhew that theſe Iſles are pieces of Land ſurrounded with Water.</p>
            <p>Theſe Iſlands are of different Natures, ſome Sandy, ſome Marſh, ſome aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in Heath and Moſs, and ſome that have none, ſome of them Mountainous and ſome Plain. Of theſe ſome are call'd the South-Iſles, and others the North-Iſles, and that as they ſtand to the South or North of the greateſt Iſland, call'd the <hi>Mainland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>South-Ronalſha</hi> is the Southermoſt of theſe Iſlands, five Miles long, fertile in Corn, and abounding with People. To the South-Eaſt lie the <hi>Pightland Sker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> dangerous to Seamen; but to the North is St. <hi>Margarets Hope,</hi> a very ſafe Harbour for Ships, which has no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in coming to it, ſave a Rock in the middle of the Sound, betwixt this Iſland and <hi>Burra,</hi> call'd <hi>Lippa.</hi> From <hi>Burwick,</hi> in this Iſle, is the uſual Ferry to <hi>Duncansbay</hi> in <hi>Cathnes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A little ſeparated from this, to the South-Weſt, lies <hi>Swinna,</hi> a little Iſle, and only conſiderable for a part of <hi>Pight</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:102617:13"/>
               <hi>land-Firth</hi> lying a little to the Weſt of it, call'd the Wells of <hi>Swinna,</hi> which are two Whirlpools in the Sea (occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd, as is thought, by ſome <hi>Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> that is in the Earth below) that run about with ſuch violence, that if any Boat or Ship come within their reach they will whirl it about and about till it be ſwallow'd up and drown'd. They are only dangerous in a great Calm; for if there be any Wind, and the Boat under Sail, there is no danger to go over them. If a Boat happen to come near them in a Calm, by the force of the Tide driving that way, the Boats-men, for their preſervation throw a Barrel or an Oar, or any bulky thing that comes next to hand, into the Wells, and when it is ſwallow'd up the Sea remains ſmooth for a time for any Boat to paſs over.</p>
            <p>Beyond this, and to the Weſt of <hi>South-Ronalſha,</hi> lies <hi>Waes</hi> and <hi>Hoy</hi> (thought to be the <hi>Dumna</hi> of <hi>Pliny)</hi> which are but one Iſle, about twelve Miles in length, full of high Mountains, and but thinly inhabited, unleſs in <hi>Waes,</hi> where the Ground is very pleaſant and fertile. From <hi>Snelſetter</hi> in <hi>Waes</hi> is the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:102617:14"/>
other Ferry from this Country to <hi>Ham,</hi> in <hi>Cathnes.</hi> Here are ſeveral good Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, as <hi>Kirk-hope, North-hope, Ore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hope,</hi> and others, but not now much frequented, tho' <hi>North-hope</hi> be one of the beſt Harbours in this Country, if not in the whole World, and moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for thoſe that deſign a Fiſhing Trade.</p>
            <p>To the North of <hi>South-Ronalſha</hi> lies <hi>Burra,</hi> a pleaſant little Iſle, fruitful in Corns and abounding in Rabbits. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Burra</hi> and the <hi>Mainland</hi> is <hi>Lamb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holm,</hi> and to the Weſt, towards <hi>Hoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> lies <hi>Flotta, Faira, Cava, Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey,</hi> all of them fruitful and pleaſant I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlands, tho' they be not large.</p>
            <p>Next to theſe is the <hi>Mainland,</hi> call'd by the Ancients <hi>Pomona</hi> or <hi>Pomonia,</hi> about twenty four Miles in length, and well inhabited. About the middle of this Iſland, to the North, ſtands <hi>Kirk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall,</hi> the only Town in all this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. There are in the <hi>Mainland</hi> four excellent Harbours for Ships, one at <hi>Kirk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall,</hi> both large and ſafe, without any danger by Shoals or blind Rocks as they come to it, unleſs they come from the Weſt by <hi>Inhallo</hi> and <hi>Gairſa:</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:102617:14"/>
Harbour is at <hi>Deirſound,</hi> which is a great Bay, and a very ſafe Road for Ships, having good anchoring ground, and capable of ſheltering the greateſt Navies. The third is at <hi>Grahamſhall,</hi> toward the Eaſt-ſide of this Iſle, where there is a convenient Road; but the Ship that ſails to it from the Eaſt, would do well to keep betwixt <hi>Lamb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holm</hi> and the <hi>Mainland,</hi> for the other way betwixt <hi>Lambholm</hi> and <hi>Burra</hi> (which appears to them to be only open) is very ſhallow and dangerous, even for ſmall Ships. The fourth is at <hi>Kair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton,</hi> a ſmall Village, at the Weſt end of the <hi>Mainland,</hi> where there is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſafe and commodious Harbour, well fenc'd againſt all Winds by two ſmall <hi>Holms</hi> that ſtand at the entry.</p>
            <p>To the Eaſt of the <hi>Mainland</hi> lies <hi>Copinſha,</hi> a little Iſle, but very conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous to Seamen, as is that <hi>Holm</hi> to the North-Eaſt of it, call'd the Horſe of <hi>Copinſha.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the North of the <hi>Mainland,</hi> lie the North-Iſles, the firſt of which is <hi>Shapinſha,</hi> about five or ſix Miles in length, and hath a very ſafe Harbour for Ships at <hi>Elwick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:102617:15"/>
Of an equal bigneſs to that toward the South-Eaſt lies <hi>Stronſa,</hi> where there is two very good Harbours; one at <hi>Lingaſound,</hi> fenc'd with <hi>Lingaholm,</hi> the other at <hi>Strynie,</hi> fenc'd with a little pleaſant Iſle to the North of it, call'd <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa-Stronſa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beyond theſe, toward the North, at ſome diſtance, lies <hi>Sanda,</hi> about twelve Miles long, but very narrow, well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited; it hath two Roads for Ships, one at <hi>Kitletoft,</hi> guarded by a little Holm, call'd the Holm of <hi>Elſnes,</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at <hi>Otterſwick,</hi> guarded by the moſt Northern-Iſland in all this Country, call'd <hi>North-Ronalſha,</hi> which is a little fruitful Iſle, but both it and <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> have no Moſs Ground, but are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to bring their Peits and Turfs (which is the only Fuel they have thorough this whole Country) a great way off, from the next adjacent Iſland, <hi>Eda.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Eda</hi> lyeth to the South-Eaſt of <hi>Sanda,</hi> thought to be the <hi>Ocetis</hi> of <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemy,</hi> near five Miles in length, full of Moſs and Hills, but thinly inhabited, unleſs it be about the skirts of it; it
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:102617:15"/>
has a ſafe Road to the North, call'd <hi>Calf-ſound.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Three Miles to the Weſt of <hi>Kirk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall,</hi> at the bottom of a large Bay, lies a little Iſland, call'd <hi>Damſey,</hi> with a Holm near it as large as it ſelf.</p>
            <p>To the North North-Weſt lies <hi>Rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa,</hi> about ſix Miles long, but very hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ill inhabited. Betwixt it and the <hi>Mainland</hi> lies <hi>Inhallo,</hi> and towards <hi>Kirkwall</hi> lies <hi>Wyre</hi> and <hi>Gairſa,</hi> ſmall but profitable Iſlands.</p>
            <p>North from <hi>Kirkwall,</hi> at eight Miles diſtance, is <hi>Egleſha,</hi> near three Miles in length, very pleaſant and fertile, having a ſafe Road for Ships betwixt it and <hi>Wyre.</hi> In this Iſle there is a little hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Church, where, it is ſaid, that Saint <hi>Magnus,</hi> the Patron of this Country, lies Bury'd.</p>
            <p>To the North of <hi>Egleſha</hi> is <hi>Weſtra,</hi> ſeven Miles long, pleaſant, fertile and well inhabited.

            <p>There are no Trees any where in all this Country, except ſome few Aſhes Thorn and Plumb Trees that are in the Biſhops Garden in <hi>Kirkwal.</hi> There are in ſome Gentlemens Gardens in <hi>Kirk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wal,</hi> and ſeveral other places of the Country, ſome Apple and Cherry-trees, but they ſeldom bear Fruit that comes to any maturity; and the Trees grow never higher than the Garden Walls. And, except ſome few wild Roſes and Juniper that I ſee in <hi>Hoy,</hi> and the <hi>Myr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillus</hi> and Heath, which is common eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where, I don't remember to have ſeen any Buſh or Shrub growing wild
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:102617:26"/>
in all the Country. Yet in a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Gardens they have ſeveral very good Plants both for Uſe and Ornament; <hi>Cabbage, Turnip, Carrot, Parſnip, Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret</hi> or <hi>Crummocks,</hi> &amp;c. grow to as great a bigneſs here as any where; and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichokes</hi> to a greater than ever I have ſeen them in any other place.</p>
            <p>I do not underſtand the reaſon why Trees don't grow here, ſince in the ſame Latitude in <hi>Norway,</hi> and ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees more Northerly, Trees thrive ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well, even on ſmall Rocks ſurroun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Sea. I know not whether it be in places where the Sea makes ſuch a breach as it does in ſome places of this Country, where the Sea-water, with the violence of the Storm, is carry'd a great way on the Land, and blaſts all it falls on: This, with the violent Winds that oft blow in this Country, I think, may be one reaſon why Trees don't proſper ſo well; but if they have the ſame Breaches in <hi>Norway,</hi> I don't know what to ſay to it. Whether Trees have grown here of old; or, what is more probable, if it be the remains yet of the Flood, but commonly, in their Moſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:102617:27"/>
they find Trees of twenty or thirty Foot long.</p>
            <p>After Storms of Weſterly Wind, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Sea-weed, they find com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly in places expos'd to the Weſtern-Ocean theſe <hi>Phaſeoli,</hi> that, I know not for what reaſon, go under the Name of <hi>Molucca</hi> Beans. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious <hi>Doctor Sloan</hi> in the <hi>Philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Tranſactions,</hi> Number 222, gives a very ſatisfactory Account, how from the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> where they commonly grow, they may be thrown in on <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the Weſtern parts of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Orkney.</hi> You have the Figures of four different ſorts of them.</p>
            <p>Here is good ſtore of Sheep and Cows, which tho' they be little, yet yield abundance of Milk. Their Ewes are ſo fertile, that moſt of them have two at a Birth, ſome three. I my ſelf ſaw one that had four all living and following the Dam.</p>
            <p>Their Horſes are but little, yet ſtrong, and can endure a great deal of Fatigue, moſt of which they have from <hi>Zet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and are call'd <hi>Shelties.</hi> There are great Herds of Swine and rich War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens almoſt in every Iſle, well ſtor'd
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:102617:27"/>
with Rabbits. Frogs are ſeen but ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, yet there are ſome Toads, tho', as it is thought, they are not poiſonous, as indeed there are few, if any, poiſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Animals in all this Country.</p>
            <p>Many <hi>Ottars</hi> and <hi>Seols</hi> are to be had every where, and oft times <hi>Spout Whales</hi> and <hi>Pellacks</hi> run in great number up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſhore and are taken, as in the Year 1691, near <hi>Kairſton</hi> in the <hi>Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> there run in a Bay no leſs than a hundred and fourteen at once.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Stellae-marinae</hi> and <hi>Urtica-Marina</hi> are oft thrown in great plenty. In the Sea they catch Ling, Keeling, Haddock, Whiting, Mackrel, Turbat, Scate, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre-Eels, Sole, Fleuks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they catch Sturgeon.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1682, in Winter, there was taken a ſtrange but beautifull Fiſh in <hi>Sanda</hi> (where ſeveral of them had been taken before) it was about an Ell in length, deep Breaſted, and narrow at the Tail; the Head and Finns, and a ſtroke down the Back were all of a deep ſcarlet colour, which made it beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful to look on; the reſt was of a brown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh colour, without ſcales, having ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral whitiſh ſpots in the Body; the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:102617:28"/>
Fiſh of the half next the Head was like Beef, and of the other half next the Tail was like Salmon.</p>
            <p>Herring ſwim thorough theſe Iſlands in great plenty, but the People are not ſo frugal, or have not the way, to catch them. Some Years ago, many Ships from <hi>Fife</hi> frequented this Country for the catching of Herrings; but the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men having been in the Year 1645, at the Battle of <hi>Kilſyth,</hi> they were there almoſt all Killed; ſince which time that Trade failed; tho' the Hollanders, to our eternal Reproach, fail not to keep it up to their great advantage.</p>
            <p>Sometimes ſtrange Fiſhes are caſt a ſhore, to which the People give as ſtrange Names. I ſee one like a Gooſe Feather, the Body being like the Quill, and the Tail like the Feather, of a red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh colour. This ſeems to be what <hi>Geſner</hi> calls, <hi>Penna Marina Sitardi.</hi> As for that ſtrange ſleeping Fiſh that <hi>Boe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thius</hi> mentions in his Deſcription of this Country, I could never hear of it.</p>
            <p>I have oft obſerv'd in the Head of the grayiſh Snail, thoſe bright white Stones <hi>Doctor Liſter</hi> mentions in his excellent Book, <hi>De Cochleis &amp; Araneis Angliae,</hi>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:102617:28"/>
The People here beat them to Powder, and reckon it a Specifick for the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel.</p>
            <p>As to their Land Shells, I cannot ſo well deſcribe, ſince, after I underſtood any thing of that part of Natural Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, the very ſhort time I ſtaid there gave me but little opportunity to make ſo nice an enquiry as I ſhould other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe have done; only I obſerv'd a great variety of the <hi>Cochleae Terreſtres,</hi> both as to their <hi>Maculae</hi> and <hi>Faſciae,</hi> and that <hi>buccinum rupium,</hi> &amp;c. which Dr. <hi>Lister</hi> deſcribes <hi>Tit.</hi> 8. <hi>De Cochleis Terrestribus.</hi> Since there are no Rivers, there can no River-ſhells be expected here; but in their ſmall Rivolets the <hi>buccinum exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guum trium ſpirarum à ſiniſtra in dextram convolutarum</hi> was common: And of the Sea-ſhells I found the</p>

There is ſuch abundance almoſt every where of Shell-fiſh, but eſpecially Cockles, that the whole Country is ſerv'd no other way with Lime, but by thoſe Shells burn'd, which makes a very fair Lime, and does very well in Plaiſter, though I doubt whether it be ſo proper for Building as ſtone Lime is.</p>
            <p>As to the Cruſtaceous Fiſhes, as <hi>Lobſters, Crabs,</hi> &amp;c. they are in as great abundance here, as any where.</p>
            <p>Here is plenty of tame and wild Fowl; they reckon they have 8 or 9 different ſorts of wild Geeſe, and of gray <hi>Plover, Moorfowl, Wild-Duck, Swans, Teal, Whaps,</hi> or <hi>Curlew,</hi> &amp;c. there is no place better ſtor'd. They have likewiſe many <hi>Foiſts</hi> and <hi>Lyers</hi> both Sea Fowls very fat and delicious. Sometime the <hi>Stock-Owl</hi> and <hi>Bittern</hi> have been ſeen in this Country. Eagle and Earns as they call them, and Gledes or Kites are here in great plenty, and very hurtful to their young Store: Yea, they have been found to ſeize upon young Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and carry them a good way of; and there is yet a Man alive, one <hi>John Hay,</hi> living now in <hi>Sanda,</hi> who was thus
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:102617:32"/>
carried away by an Eagle, while a young Child in ſwadling cloaths (his Mother having left him on the Graſs, till ſhe went a little way to carry ſomewhat) to her Neſt; but was ſo ſpeedily by the bleſſing of God preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that no harm was done to him.

the Country, except ſome places that are Privileg'd.</p>
            <p>There are ſeveral Mines of Tinn, Lead, and perhaps of other Metals, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in the <hi>Mainland, South-Ronalſha, Hoy, Stronſa, Sanda,</hi> but are neglected, or not improved, through Poverty or Careleſsneſs. A great deal of Marle is found, eſpecially in the <hi>Mainland,</hi> of which the Husbandman makes good uſe for mannor. In many places are Quarries of excellent free or ſand Stone and Slate. Not far from <hi>Birſa</hi> at <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quoy</hi> and <hi>Swinna</hi> are to be found ſome Veins of Marble and Alabaſter.</p>
            <p>On the ſhore, ſometimes, is to be found <hi>Sperma Ceti, Ambergreeſe, Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponges,</hi> and a great many Cuttle-bones, or <hi>Os Sepiae.</hi> Sometimes they catch Exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Fowls, driven in by the Wind in time of a Storm; as one ſome time ago that had along Beak, a large tuft on the Head, in faſhion of a Crown, with ſpeckled Feathers, very pleaſant to ſee, which, I believe, was the <hi>Upupa;</hi> and two or three Years ago, in <hi>Sanda;</hi> there was a very beautiful Bird driven in there alive; they afterwards ſhot it, and I had it ſent me; 'twas ſomething like
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:102617:33"/>
a Woodpecker, but of extraordinary lively Colours, eſpecially a light Blue and a Green. And I have ſeen the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardeola,</hi> or <hi>Shovelaer,</hi> driven in there.</p>
            <p>Some Years ſince, the Day being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Stormy, there were found be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Gentleman's Door in <hi>Kirkwal,</hi> ſome little diſtance from the Sea, ſeven or eight <hi>Quiths</hi> (a Fiſh ſomething leſs than a Whiting) half alive, as if they had been but newly taken; it's like the violent Wind, they ſwimming on the top of the Water, had heav'd them out of the Sea, and when the ſtrength of the blaſt was gone, they had fall'n on that place.</p>
            <p>But how violently the Wind blows here, and how great is the force of the Sea breach, may appear from this, That at <hi>Cantick-head</hi> and <hi>Oſnua-head</hi> in <hi>Waes,</hi> there are, by the violence of the Sea and Winds, large Stones thrown up from the bottom, a great way above the Rock, ſome ſo large, That ſome Men can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly move them.</p>
            <p>This Country being divided in to ſmall Iſlands, it cannot be expected there ſhould be in it any Rivers, yet there is every where a great many Rivulets or

Bourns, as they call them, well reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd with Trouts, both ſmall and great, ſome of them like to young Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</p>
            <p>There is a large Loch or Lake in the <hi>Mainland,</hi> call'd the Loch of <hi>Stennis,</hi> but unfruitful. Beſides that, there are in every Iſland ſome ſmall Lochs, but they ſerve for no other uſe but to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford Water to their Mills and Cattle. There be alſo ſome Lochs that have ſome remarkable properties, as Saint <hi>Tredwell</hi>'s Loch, in <hi>Papa-Weſtra,</hi> which, they ſay, is Medicinal; but for what I know not: There is another Loch in <hi>Shapinſha,</hi> of which, it is ſaid, that if any waſh their feet in it, they will ſtrike out in Bliſters. The Loch of <hi>Swanna,</hi> in the <hi>Mainland,</hi> will have, in ſome parts, a thick ſcum, of a Copper Colour, upon it, which makes ſome think there is ſome Mine under it.</p>

            </head>
            <p>THere is in <hi>Hoy,</hi> lying betwixt two Hills, a Stone, call'd the <hi>Dwarfie-Stone,</hi> which is one entire Stone, thirty ſix Foot long, eighteen Foot broad, nine Foot thick; hallow'd within by the Hand of ſome Maſon (for the prints of the Irons are to be ſeen on it to this day) with a ſquare hole of about two Foot high for the entry, and a Stone proportionable ſtanding before it for a Door. Within, at one end, is a Bed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently cut out of the Stone, with a Pillow, wherein two Men may lie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether at their full length; at the other
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:102617:35"/>
end is a Couch, and in the middle a Hearth for a Fire, with a round hole cut out above for the Chimney. It ſtands in a deſolate melancholy place, more than a Mile from any inhabited Houſe, and all the Ground about it no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but high Heath and Heather. It's thought to have been the reſidence of ſome melancholy Hermit. See the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of it.</p>
            <p>At the Weſt-end of this Stone ſtands on exceeding high Mountain, of a ſteep aſcent, call'd the <hi>Wart Hill</hi> of <hi>Hoy;</hi> near the top of which, in the Month of <hi>May, June,</hi> and <hi>July,</hi> about Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, is ſeen ſomething that ſhines and ſparkles admirably, and which is often ſeen a great way off. It hath ſhined more brightly before than it does now, tho' many have climbed up the Hill, and attempted to ſearch for it, yet they could find nothing. The Vulgar talk of it as ſome enchanted Carbuncle; but I take it rather to be ſome Water ſliding down the face of a ſmooth Rock, which when the Sun at ſuch a time ſhines upon, the reflection cauſeth that admirable ſplendor.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:102617:35"/>
At <hi>Stennis,</hi> in the <hi>Mainland,</hi> where the Loch is narroweſt, in the middle, having a Cauſey of Stones over it for a Bridge, there is, at the South-end of the Bridge, a Round ſet about with high ſmooth Stones or Flags, about twenty Foot high above ground, ſix Foot broad, and each a Foot or two thick. Betwixt that Round and the Bridge are two Stones ſtanding of that ſame largeneſs with the reſt, whereof one hath a round hole in the midſt of it; and at the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end of the Bridge, about half a Mile removed from it, is a large Round about an hundred and ten paces in Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter, ſet about with ſuch Stones as the former, but that ſome of them are fall'n down; and at both Eaſt and Weſt of this bigger Round, are two artificial (as is thought) green Mounts; both theſe Rounds are ditched about. See the Figure of it.</p>
            <p>Some think that theſe Rounds have been places whereon two oppoſite Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies have encamped; but I think it more probable that they have been the high places in the <hi>Pagan</hi> times, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Sacrifice was offered, and that theſe two Mounts were the places where the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:102617:36"/>
Aſhes of the Sacrifice was flung. And this is the more probable, becauſe <hi>Boe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thius,</hi> in the Life of <hi>Mainus,</hi> King of <hi>Scots,</hi> makes mention of that kind of high Stones, calling them the Temples of the Gods. His words are theſe. <q>In Memory of what King <hi>Mainus</hi> ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned anent the worſhip of the Gods, there remains yet, in our days, many huge Stones drawn together in form of a Circle, named by the People the Ancient Temples of the Gods; and it is no ſmall admiration to conſider by what Art or Strength ſo many huge Stones have been brought together.</q> So far <hi>Boethius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are beſides in many other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this Country, <hi>Obelisks,</hi> or great high Stones, ſet in the Ground like the former, and ſtanding apart (and indeed they are ſo very large that none ſees them, but wonders by what Engine they have been erected) which are thought to be ſet up either as a memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial of ſome famous Battle, or as a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument of ſome remarkable Perſon that has been buried there; that way of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring deſerving and valiant Men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:102617:36"/>
the invention of King <hi>Rentha,</hi> as <hi>Boe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thius</hi> ſays.</p>
            <p>There is in <hi>Rouſay,</hi> betwixt high Mountains, a place, call'd the Camp of <hi>Jupiter Fring.</hi> The name is ſtrange and would import ſome notable acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; but what it was I could not learn.</p>
            <p>At the Weſt-end of the <hi>Mainland,</hi> near <hi>Skeal,</hi> on the top of high Rocks, more than a quarter of a Mile in length, there is ſomething like a Street all ſet in red Clay, with a ſort of reddiſh Stones of ſeveral figures and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes; having the Images and Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations of ſeveral things, as it were, engraven on them; and, which is very ſtrange, a great many of theſe Stones, when they are raiſed up, have that ſame Image engraven under, which they have above. This Cauſey is all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the tops of Rocks, and though they be otherwiſe of a very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable heighth above the Sea, yet the Weſt Ocean in a Storm leading that way, does daſhwith ſuch violence againſt the Rocks, that the Sea breaches do waſh the Ground on the tops of the Rocks. If theſe Stones had not the ſame Figure on that ſide next the ground
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:102617:37"/>
that they have above, I ſhould think the Sea waſhing over them might occaſion theſe different figures, by waſhing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the ſoftiſh parts of the Stone and leaving the harder, and ſo accordingly give them theſe accidental Shapes and Figures. Tho' there are a great many of them ſtill remaining, yet the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen living near that place have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away thoſe that had the prettieſt Figures to ſet their Chimnies with, as they uſe to do in <hi>Holland</hi> with painted Bricks and Tiles.</p>
            <p>In the Links of <hi>Skeal,</hi> where the Sand is blown away with the Wind, are found ſeveral places built ſquare, with Stones well cemented together, and a Stone lying in the mouth, having ſome black Earth in them. The like of which alſo are found in the Links of <hi>Rouſum</hi> in <hi>Stronſa;</hi> where alſo, ſome Years ago, was ſound another remarkable Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It was a whole round Stone like a Barrel, hollow within, ſharp edged at the top, having the bottom joyn'd like the bottom of a Barrel; on the mouth was a round Stone conform to the mouth of the Monument, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove that a large Stone for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:102617:37"/>
of the whole; within was nothing but red Clay and burn'd Bones. See the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure. It's like that this and the other Four-ſquare Monuments have been ſome of theſe Urns wherein the Romans, when they were in this Country, laid up the Aſhes of their dead. Likewiſe in the Links of <hi>Tranabie,</hi> in <hi>Weſtra,</hi> have been found Graves in the Sand, in one of which was ſeen a Man lying with his Sword on the one Hand, and a Daniſh Axe on the other; and others that have had Dogs, and Combs and Knives bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd with them, which ſeems to ſhew the way how the <hi>Danes,</hi> when they were in this Country, bury'd their dead, as the other was of the <hi>Romans.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides in many places of the Country are found little Hillocks, which may be ſuppoſed to be the <hi>Sepulchres</hi> of the ancient <hi>Pights.</hi> For <hi>Tacitus</hi> tells that it was the way of the ancient <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> and <hi>Verſtegan</hi> that it was the way of the ancient <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> to lay dead Bodies on the ground, and cover them over with turſs and clods of earth, in the faſhion of little Hillocks: hence it ſeems that the many Houſes and Villages in this Country,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:102617:38"/>
which are call'd by the name of <hi>Brogh,</hi> and which all of them are built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or beſide ſome ſuch riſing ground, have been cemeteries for the burying of the dead in the time of the <hi>Pights</hi> and <hi>Saxons:</hi> For the word <hi>Brogh</hi> in the Teutonick Language, ſignifies a burying place.</p>
            <p>In one of theſe hillocks near the circle of high Stones, at the North end of the Bridge of <hi>Stennis,</hi> there were found nine <hi>Fibulae</hi> of Silver of the ſhape of a Horſe-ſhooe, but round. See the Figure of one of them.</p>
            <p>Moreover in many places of this Country, are to be ſeen the ruins and veſtiges of great but antique Buildings; moſt of them now covered over with Earth, and call'd in this Country <hi>Pights</hi> Houſes, ſome of which its like have been the Forts and Reſidences of the <hi>Pights</hi> and <hi>Danes,</hi> when they poſſeſs'd this Country.</p>
            <p>Among the reſt there is one in the Iſle of <hi>Wyre,</hi> called the Caſtle of <hi>Cubbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,</hi> or rather <hi>Coppi-row,</hi> which in the <hi>Teutonick</hi> Language, ſignifies a Tower of Security from outward violence. It is Trenched about, of it nothing now
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:102617:38"/>
remains but the firſt Floor. It is a perfect Square, the Wall eight foot thick, ſtrongly built and cemented with Lime, the breadth or length within Walls not being above ten foot, having a large Door and a ſlit for the Window.

            <p>In the Pariſh of <hi>Hara</hi> in the <hi>Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> in a Marle-pit as they were dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Marle for mannor to their ground, there was found in the Marle a large piece of a Harts horn, as I was credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly inform'd by a Gentleman who got the Horn from theſe men, and had it then by him.</p>
            <p>In the Pariſh of <hi>Evie</hi> near the Sea are ſome ſmall hillocks, which frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the night time appear all in a Fire, and the Church of <hi>Evie</hi> called St. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> is oft ſeen full of Light, as if Torches or Candles were burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in it all night. This amazes the people greatly, but poſſibly it's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but ſome thick glutinous Meteor, that receives that Light in the night time.</p>

At the <hi>Noup-head</hi> in <hi>Weſtra</hi> is a Rock ſurrounded with the Sea, call'd <hi>Leſs,</hi> which the inhabitants of that Iſle ſay, has this ſtrange property; that if a Man go upon it, having any Iron upon him, the Sea will inſtantly ſwell in ſuch a Tempeſtuous way, that no Boat can come near to take him off, and the Sea will not be calm'd till the Iron be thrown away: I being there to make an experiment of it, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd Money to a poor fellow, to go upon the Rock, with a piece of Iron, but he would not do it on any terms.</p>
            <p>Sometimes about this Country, are ſeen theſe men they call <hi>Finn-men.</hi> In the year 1682, one was ſeen in his little Boat, at the South end of the Iſle of <hi>Eda,</hi> moſt of the people of the Iſle flock'd to ſee him, and when they adventur'd to put out a Boat with Men to ſee if they could apprehend him, he preſently fled away moſt ſwiftly. And in the year 1684, another was ſeen from <hi>Weſtra;</hi> I muſt acknowledge it ſeems a little unaccountable, how theſe Finn-men ſhould come on this coaſt, but they muſt probably be driven by Storms from home, and cannot tell when they
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:102617:39"/>
are any way at Sea, how to make their way home again; they have this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, that be the Seas never ſo boi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous their Boat being made of Fiſh Skins, are ſo contrived that he can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſink, but is like a Sea-gull ſwimming on the top of the Water. His ſhirt he has is ſo faſtned to the Boat, that no Water can come into his Boat to do him damage, except when he pleaſes to unty it, which he never does but to eaſe nature, or when he comes aſhore. A full account of theſe <hi>Finn-men,</hi> may be had <hi>en L'hiſtoire naturelle &amp; moralle des Antilles</hi> Chap. 18. One of their Boats which was catched in <hi>Orkney,</hi> was ſent from thence to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and is to be ſeen in the Phyſicians Hall, with the Oar and Dart he makes uſe of for killing Fiſh.

            <p>THE People here are generally civil, ſagacious, circumſpect and piouſly inclined; Though <hi>Boethius</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports them to be great Drunkards and <hi>Maginus</hi> ſays of them, <hi>quod ſunt bibaciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimi, nunquam tamen inebriantur,</hi> yet now it is not ſo; for though they uſe ſtrong Ale and Beer (the nature of the Country requiring ſtrong Liquor) yet generally they are Sober and Temperate, but withal much given to Hoſpitality
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:102617:40"/>
and Feaſting, very civil and liberal in their entertaining of Strangers, and much inclined to ſpeak ill of thoſe that are peeviſhly or niggardly diſpos'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Buchanan</hi> tells a Story, which is ſtill believ'd here and talk'd of as a truth, though now there be nothing of it. That at <hi>Scapa</hi> a place about a mile of <hi>Kirkwal</hi> to the South, there was kept a large cup, and when any new Biſhop landed there, they filled it with ſtrong Ale, and offer'd it to him to drink, and if he happened to drink it of chearfully, they promiſed to themſelves a Noble Biſhop, and many good years in his time.</p>
            <p>In many places the Landlord has his Tenant bound to give him and his followers, a liberal Entertainment once a year, eſpecially at <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> (at which time the People of this Country are generally inclin'd to Feaſting) and the Tenant wont fail to have good Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als and ſtrong Ale (which they call Bummock) in readineſs, and will be much offended if the Landlord refuſe to make merry with them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:102617:41"/>
The People are generally perſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and comely, <hi>Polyd. Virgil</hi> ſays of them, <hi>Quod ſtatura ſunt procera, ſemper ſano corpore, pariter ac mente, quo fit ut multo longiſſimam degant aetatem, etſi piſcibus ut plurimum victitant.</hi> The Women are Lovely and of a Beautiful countenance, and very broody and apt for generation; one <hi>Marjory Bimbiſter</hi> in the Pariſh of <hi>Evie,</hi> was in the year 1683, brought to bed of a Male child in the ſixty third year of her age, as may be ſeen by the following atteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>We under ſubſcribers teſtify and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that <hi>Marjory Bimbiſter</hi> in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh of <hi>Evie</hi> in <hi>Orkney,</hi> was in <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> 1683. untimeouſly delivered of a Male child; though we have alſo ſure account of her age in our Regiſter of Baptiſm, yet many of the Pariſh who are of ſixty four years, and whoſe age is certainly known, report that to their knowledge ſhe is as old as they: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides her ſelf remembers, that in the year 1631, (which was a year of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine in this Country, and from which the common People uſually reckon) ſhe was keeping Cattle, being then a
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:102617:41"/>
Girl, as ſhe thought; about nine or ten Years of Age. In the Year 1660, ſhe was marry'd to <hi>Adam Hourie,</hi> to whom, about five Years after, <hi>viz.

            <p>By reaſon of the temperance of their Dyet and wholſomneſs of the Air, the People uſually live to a great Age. A Man in the Pariſh of <hi>Ham</hi> dyed not many Years ſince, who liv'd upwards of Fourſcore Years with one Wife, in a marry'd eſtate. There is alſo a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, yet living in <hi>Stronſa,</hi> who was Begotten of his Father when he was an hundred Years old, and did live till he ſaw this ſame Man's Children.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:102617:42"/>
Some there be alſo of an exceeding high Stature, as that young Man, who, for his height, was uſually call'd, <hi>The Mickle Man of Waes,</hi> as being a great deal higher than the common ſort of Men. At the Chaple of <hi>Clet,</hi> in <hi>Sanda,</hi> is a Grave to be ſeen, wherein, they ſay, a Giant was bury'd; and indeed the Stone that is laid upon the Grave is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout twelve Foot long; ſo that, if the Body has been proportionable to the Grave, it has been exceeding Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous.</p>
            <p>The more common and general Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes here are the Scurvy, Agues, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Commonly in the Spring they are troubled with an Aguiſh Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper which they call the <hi>Axes,</hi> but for this there are <hi>Quacks</hi> amongſt them that pretend an infallible Cure, by way of Diet-drink, infuſing a Hotch-potch of ſeveral Plants (I ſuppoſe what are greeneſt at that time) in an Engliſh Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon of Ale; the Receipt is this, They take of <hi>Buckhorn, Plantain, Water Plantain, Lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, wild Daiſie, Rocket, Roots of Elecampane, Millefoil, Roots of Spignell, Dandelyon, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſley Roots, Wormwood, Cumfrey, Tanſey, Thrift</hi> or <hi>Sea-Pink; Garden Angelica,</hi> and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:102617:42"/>
a kind of <hi>Maſterwort,</hi> the <hi>Imperatoriae aſſinis;</hi> of all theſe they take a like quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, to wit, about half a handful, and of this Infuſion they drink half a Pint Morning and Evening. This is what they call the <hi>Axes Graſs,</hi> and the old Women talk wonders of it, pretending there are ſo many of the Herbs good for the Liver, ſo many good for the Head, and ſo many for the Heart, Spleen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In Phthiſical Diſtempers they uſe <hi>Arby,</hi> the <hi>Caryophyllus Marinus, Thrift</hi> or much as they call it, boyl'd with ſweet Milk.</p>
            <p>Inſtead of a Cupping-glaſs they have a Horn with a ſmall thin Skin at the ſmaller end. The way how they uſe it is thus: The Surgeon with the point of his Knife gives three or four ſmall cuts or gaſhes on the place where he purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to ſet the Horn; and having ſet the broadeſt end on the Wounds, he ſucks the ſmall end a little, and then lets it ſtand till the abundance of Blood it draws makes it fall off. Some have a way, as they pretend (if they be to Cure any akeing or inward Pain) to draw out ſeveral little Worms out of the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:102617:43"/>
part affected, whereby they remove the Pain. Others there be that uſe Charms for the curing of the Rickets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but theſe are much curbed by their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</p>
            <p>All ſpeak Engliſh, after the Scots way, with as good an Accent as any County in the Kingdom, only ſome of the common People, amongſt themſelves, ſpeak a Language they call <hi>Norns;</hi> which they have derived to them, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the <hi>Pights,</hi> or ſome others, who firſt planted this Country; for by the following Lord's Prayer, in that Language, it has but little of the <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> or <hi>Norwegian</hi> Language, to which I thought it ſhould have had more affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, conſidering how long time they were poſſeſſors of this Country.</p>

            <p>Since <hi>Geſner,</hi> in his <hi>Mithridates,</hi> nor Biſhop <hi>Wilkins,</hi> in his <hi>Real Character,</hi> have nothing like this, I thought this Formula might not be unacceptable.</p>
            <p>Anciently, as they are yet in great meaſure, they were much given to Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, as appears by the many Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels that are here and there diſperſed through the Country; but the Chapels to which moſt frequently they made their Pilgrimage, were to the Chapels of the <hi>Brough</hi> of <hi>Birſa,</hi> and to the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of the <hi>Brough</hi> at the <hi>Mulehead</hi> in <hi>Deirneſs;</hi> theſe two Chapels ſtanding at the furtheſt extremities of the <hi>Mainland</hi> Eaſt and Weſt; nor to this day are theſe Pilgrimages omitted by the common People, who ſtill, for the obtaining of ſome good, or deprecating of ſome evil, do frequent ſome Chapels they have moſt veneration for. Beſides, they have this general cuſtome; The day that is
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:102617:44"/>
dedicated to the Memory of the Saint who is Patron of the chief Church, where Sermon is made, is kept Holy by the common People of the whole Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh; ſo that they will not Work on that day: And thoſe that live next the ſmaller Chapels do moreover keep holy that Day, that is dedicated to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of that Saint, that Chapel is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated by.</p>
            <p>Here they make no uſe of Poaks or Sacks, but a ſort of Veſſel made of Straw, which they call <hi>Caſſies,</hi> in which they keep and tranſport their Corn: Nor do they make uſe of Peck and Firlot, or any other Meaſure, for their Grain, as they uſe to do thorough the reſt of the Kingdom, but weigh all, which they have a particular way of doing with Biſmires for ſmall Weights; and Pound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, as they call them, for great Weights. In moſt it reſembles a Stilliard that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is weighed on. It is a Beam of Timber marked with different weights, which hath a Stone at one end (which Stone on the Malt Poundler ſhould be a ſetten weight, and on the Bear Pound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler ſixteen Merk) and a Hook at the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end for hanging up the Caſſie in
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:102617:44"/>
which the Corn or Meal is, and there is a Ring in the middle near the Sheir that has a Pole thruſt thorough it, by which, by the help of a Man at each end all is ſupported, that the Caſſie may ſwim fair. The leaſt weight is call'd a Merk, which will be eighteen Ounces, twenty four Merks make a Lecſpound or Setten, ſix Settens make a Meil (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivalent to a Boll) and eighteen Meils make a Chaldron.</p>
            <p>In every Iſle they have a Wart-hill, or Ward-hill, which is the moſt conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous and elevated part of the Iſle, on which, in time of War, they keep Ward; and when they ſee the Enemies Ships approaching, they put a Fire, thereby to give notice to the adjacent Iſles of the nearneſs of the Enemy, and to advertiſe them to be on their Guard, or to come to their help; this they diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh by the number of Fires.</p>
            <p>Their Corn Land is every where Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and without theſe incloſures their Sheep and Swine, and ſome of their Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle go at random, without a Herdſman to keep them. The moſt ordinary Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour they have for their Land, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in places near the Sea, is, Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weed,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:102617:45"/>
Sea-ware, as they call it; and in Bayes, after Storms, when the Wrack is driven in greater plenty, all the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Neighbourhood come and divide the Wrack according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of Land they have about that place; but methinks 'tis the greateſt ſlavery in the World, for the common People, as they do there in Winter, to carry this Wrack in ſmall Veſſels made of Straw or Caſſies on their Backs to their Land.</p>
            <p>All their Sheep are marked on the Ears or Noſe, every man that hath Sheep hath his own Mark, whereby his Sheep are diſtinguiſh'd from others: And 'tis ſtrange to conſider how ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different Marks could be invented, as are found cut in ſo little room. They uſe to Fleece their Sheep about the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>May,</hi> and the way they take to apprehend them (for they go wild) is both ſtrange and pleaſant. The Bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liff of the Pariſh, with the <hi>Law-right-men</hi> which are the Bailiffs Aſſeſſors, and the perſons to whom the Sheep belong meet together on a day appointed, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving with them Sheep Dogs, trained up for the Hunting of them, and when
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:102617:45"/>
they would have ſuch a Sheep caught, they point him out by the finger to the Dog, upon which he runs and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles out that Sheep from all the reſt, and never leaves of running till he catch him, which being fleec'd or ſhorn by the owner, they then go on and hunt for others.</p>
            <p>They have alſo a pleaſant way of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Sea Fowls when they are young as <hi>Foiſts, Lyers, Kittiwaeks, Gulls</hi> &amp;c. which build very thick on ſhelves of high Rocks; under the Rock there is a Boat with men having a large Net, which at the two uppermoſt corners is faſtned with two long Ropes, which are in the hands of men at the top of the Rock, who hoiſe up the Net till it be over againſt the place where the young Fowl ſit, then they that are in the Boat under the Rock, have a Rattle which makes ſo frighting a noiſe, that all the young Fowls take wing and fly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward into the boſom of the Net where they are caught: Then the Net is laid down in the Boat and the Prey ſeiſed upon, and thus they go from Rock to Rock taking as many as they can.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:102617:46"/>
Others have this way in taking theſe Fowls, a Man that is accuſtomed to the exerciſe has a Rope well bound about his middle, with which he is let ſlide down the ſteep Rock, till he be over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the place where the young Fowls are, of whom he apprehends as many as he is able to carry and then is hoiſted up with his Prey. They uſe that way alſo in taking the young Hawks. There are ſome Fellows ſo hardy that go a catching of Sea Fowls without any help, by tying a Rope about his own mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and tying the other end to a Stake, which he drives well in the Ground, and ſo lets himſelf go over the Rock (perhaps ſome hundred of fathoms) and catches what Fowls he can and then hoiſes himſelf up again.</p>
            <p>Several remarkable accidents have fall'n out in this Country, beſides ſome already mentioned. I ſhall inſtance in three or four only, whereof the witneſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es are ſtill alive. About the year 1634, when Biſhop <hi>Grahame</hi> was Biſhop of this Country, a young Boy named <hi>William Garioch,</hi> his Father being dead, had ſome little Land, and ſome ſmall portion of Cattle, left him by his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:102617:46"/>
in the Pariſh of <hi>Ham;</hi> his Uncle took him in his Service, and having a greedy deſire after the Young mans Poſſeſſions, it happen'd that he ſtole a Setten of Barley (which will be about Twenty Eight pound weight) from his Uncle: For which he purſued him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Sheriff of the Biſhoprick, and the Young man, at that time about Eighteen years of Age, the Theft be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proved was Sentenced to be hanged. When he was at the Gallows he prayed that God would inflict ſome viſible Judgment on his Uncle, who becauſe of the greedy deſire he had to his little Portion, had for ſo ſmall a matter procur'd his Death. It came to paſs that his Uncle walking thorough the Church-Yard of <hi>Kirkwal,</hi> upon the Young mans Grave, the Biſhops Dog ſeiſed on him and tore out his Throat, whereby he became a ſad monument of God's wrath, againſt ſuch impious greedy wretches.</p>
            <p>Some years ago, one <hi>James Lenay</hi> and ſome others, Fiſhing in a Boat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide <hi>Auſkerie,</hi> in a fair day it came to paſs, that their leaning all on one ſide of the Boat, that it overturned and all
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:102617:47"/>
were drowned, except the ſaid <hi>Lenay,</hi> who by providence got up, and ſat on the Keil of the Boat, in which conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he continued for the ſpace of four days, driven by the Tides, ſometime this way, and ſometime that, ſometimes to <hi>Weſtra,</hi> and back again to <hi>Stronſa,</hi> till at laſt he was ſeen floating by <hi>Spur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> in <hi>Sanda,</hi> where by the careful en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour of the Gentleman who was owner of the Ground he was deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>There was one <hi>John Smith</hi> who lived in <hi>Stronſa,</hi> who, with three others uſed to fiſh not far from Land; their way was to riſe early and ſtay many Hours a Fiſhing. This Man having, by ſeveral days Fiſhing, gotten a great plenty of Fiſh, his Wife was deſirous that he would omit that exerciſe for a time, and ſtay at home to take his reſt. He was very unwilling to do ſo, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore next Morning ſhe riſes before him, and being deſirous he might take a longer Sleep, after ſo many days toil, ſhe ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the holes and windows of the Room where he lay that he might ſleep the more ſoundly, and then ſhe went to the Fields to her work, where, working
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:102617:47"/>
with her Servants ſhe was ſurpris'd with this ſad accident. The three men that uſed to fiſh with her Husband, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he came not, had taken the Boat themſelves and gone a Fiſhing, and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly the Boat overturned (no man knows how) and the men were all drowned. This the Woman and her Servants ſeeing ſtartled them greatly, but tho' ſhe was grieved for their death, yet ſhe was glad that her Husband (by her Policy) went not to Sea with them, and thereupon runs haſtily to the houſe to acquaint her Husband with that ſad accident, and to congratulate with him for his preſervation: when opening the door ſhe was ſurpris'd with a more ſad and aſtoniſhing ſight, even the Death of her own husband: For he having riſen out of his bed, had fallen with his head in a large veſſel wherein they uſed to make Urine, where he was choked and found dead.</p>
            <p>Strange are the effects that are here ſometimes produc'd by Thunder and Lightning, for by it, <hi>Anno</hi> 1670 the Steeple of the Cathedral Church at <hi>Kirkwal</hi> was burned, and ſometimes it will ſeize on low Cottages. In the

            <head>CHAP. V. <hi>Of the Town of</hi> Kirkwall.</head>
            <p>THE only remarkable Town in all this Country is <hi>Kirkwall,</hi> an ancient Burrough long poſſeſſed by the <hi>Norwegians,</hi> by whom it was called <hi>Cracoviaca,</hi> built upon a pleaſant Oyſe or Inlet of the Sea, near the middle of the <hi>Mainland;</hi> narrow ſtreeted, and about a mile in length, having a very ſafe Harbour and road for Ships. Here is the Seat of Juſtice, the Steward, Sheriff, Commiſſary, all of them keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ſeveral Courts in this place. Almoſt all the Houſes in this Town are Slaited, but the moſt remarkable Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:102617:48"/>
in it are the Cathedral Church and the Biſhops Palace. As for the Kings Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle it is new demoliſhed, but by the Ruins it appears to have been a ſtrong and ſtately Fort, and probably built by ſome of the Biſhops of <hi>Orkney,</hi> as would appear from a remarkable Stone ſet in the midſt of the Wall, which looks towards the ſtreet, with a Biſhops Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Arms engraven'd on it. There is here a publick School for the Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Grammar, endowed with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Salary, and at the North end of the Town is a place built by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in <hi>Oliver</hi>'s time, Ditched about, with a Breaſt-work, and ſome other Fortifications, on which they have ſome Cannon planted for the defence of the Harbour.</p>
            <p>This Town had been erected into a Royal Burrough in the time of the <hi>Norwegians,</hi> and <hi>Anno</hi> 1486, King <hi>James</hi> the Third gave them a Charter, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming their old Erection and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges; ſpecifying their antiquity, and giving them power to hold Burrough Courts, to incarcerate and arreſt, to make Laws and Ordinances, and to elect their own Magiſtrates yearly for
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:102617:49"/>
the right Government of the Town, and to have a weekly Market on <hi>Tueſday</hi> and <hi>Friday,</hi> and three Fairs in the Year, one about <hi>Palm-Sunday,</hi> the other at <hi>Lammas,</hi> and the third at <hi>Martinmas,</hi> each to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue three Days; he moreover diſponed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to them ſome Lands about the Town, with the Cuſtoms and ſhore dues, and the power of a Pitt and Gallows, and all other privileges granted to any Royal Burrough within the Kingdom, exeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them from ſending any Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to Parliament, unleſs their own ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities require it. This Charter is da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> the laſt of <hi>March</hi> 1486, and in the Year 1536 <hi>February</hi> the 8th, King <hi>James</hi> V. ratified the former Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by a new Charter of Confirmation. And in the Year 1661 King <hi>Charles</hi> II. after his Reſtoration ratified the former Charters, at <hi>Whitehall May</hi> 25th, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Parliament at <hi>Edinburgh, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt</hi> 22d 1670 confirm'd all by their Act, yet with this ſpecial proviſion, That what was granted to them by that Act, might not prejudice the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the Biſhop of <hi>Orkney.</hi>

            <head>CHAP. VI. <hi>Of the ancient State of the Church of</hi> Orkney. <hi>Of the Cathedral Church at</hi> Kirkwall. <hi>Biſhop</hi> Robert Reid<hi>'s ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Chapter. Biſhop</hi> Law<hi>'s Tranſaction with King James</hi> VI.</head>
            <p>THE Church of this Country, as alſo that of <hi>Zetland,</hi> was under the Government of one Biſhop, ſtil'd Biſhop of <hi>Orkney</hi> and <hi>Zetland.</hi> The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop's Revenue was great before, but at preſent, it will not amount to much more than Six hundred Pound Sterling; and now the King's Exchequer, conſidering how much that Country has of late been impoveriſhed, Farm it out for Four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Pound Sterling.</p>
            <p>The Cathedral Church is St. <hi>Magnus</hi>'s Church in <hi>Kirkwall;</hi> it was founded, as is thought, by St. <hi>Magnus,</hi> or rather by <hi>Rolland</hi> Earl of <hi>Orkney,</hi> who founded it in memory of his Cozen St. <hi>Magnus,</hi> See the double of the Manuſcript in the 8th Chapter; but it has been enlarged
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:102617:50"/>
by ſome of the Pious Biſhops of that See; for Biſhop <hi>Steward</hi> enlarged it to the Eaſt, all above the Grees, and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <hi>Reid</hi> three Pillars to the Weſt. It's as beautiful and ſtately a Structure as is in the Kingdom, and perhaps by much the longeſt as it is now; for I have mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd it, and, by ſome Feet, it is lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than that of St. <hi>Giles</hi> at <hi>Edinburgh;</hi> it's built croſs-ways, for the moſt part of Free-ſtone, ſtanding on Pillars, all moſt curiouſly vaulted, and the Steeple elevated to a great height, in which is a ſet of as excellent and ſweetly chim'd Bells, as are in any Cathedral of the Kingdom. In the Year 1670, the Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramid of the Steeple, being cover'd with Wo<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Beſides the Cathedral, there are one and thirty Churches more in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, wherein Divine Service is celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as alſo a great many ancient Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels, above an hundred in number, which ſhews that this Country was no leſs anciently than it is at preſent addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to Devotion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:102617:50"/>
This Dioceſs had its ſeveral ancient Dignities and Privileges for a long time; but theſe, by the conſtant trouble this Country was in by the change of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, being leſſen'd and grown worſe, Biſhop <hi>Robert Reid</hi> made a new Ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Foundation of the Chapter, <hi>viz.</hi> Seven Dignities, whereof the firſt was a Provoſt or Dean, to whom, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Biſhop, the Correction and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſight of the Canons, Prebendaries and Chaplains was to belong. He had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loted to him the Prebend of Holy Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and Vicarage of <hi>South-Ronalſha,</hi> with the Maintenance of the Church of <hi>Burza.</hi> 2. An Archdeacon, who was to Govern the People according to the diſpoſition of the Canon-law, and to him was allotted the Archdeacons an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Rights, the Vicarage of <hi>Birſa</hi> and Chaplainry of St. <hi>Ola,</hi> within the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral Church of <hi>Kirkwall,</hi> together with the Maintainance of the Church of <hi>Hara.</hi> 3.

A Chancellor, who was to be learned in
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:102617:51"/>
both Laws, and bound to read in the Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifical Law publickly in the Chapter to all that ought to be preſent, and to look to the preſerving and mending the Books of the Quire and Regiſter, and to keep the common Seal and Key of the Library; to him was allotted the Prebend of St. <hi>Mary</hi> in <hi>Sanda,</hi> and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carage of <hi>Sanda.</hi> 5. A Treaſurer, who was to keep the Treaſure of the Church and Sacred Veſtments, and to have a care of the Bread, Wine, Wax, Oyland Lights, for the Church; to him was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted the Rectory of St. <hi>Nicholas</hi> in <hi>Stronſa,</hi> and Vicarage of <hi>Stronſa.</hi> 6.

            </p>
            <p>Likewiſe he erected Seven other Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons and Prebendaries, to wit, 1. The Prebendary of <hi>Holy-croſs;</hi> to him was given the Perſonage of <hi>Croſskirk</hi> in <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da;</hi> he was to be a ſpecial keeper of

The Prebendary of St. <hi>Mary;</hi> to whom was given the Chaplainry of St. <hi>Mary</hi> and Vicarage of <hi>Evie;</hi> he was to have a care of the Roof and Windows of the Cathedral, and to have them helped if need were. 3.

The 4th. Prebendary was to have the Chaplainry of St. <hi>John</hi> the Evangeliſt, in the ſaid Cathedral Church. The 5th. Prebendary was to have the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainry of St. <hi>Lawrence.</hi> The 6th. was to have the Prebend of St. <hi>Katharine.</hi> And the 7th. Prebendary was to have the Prebend of St. <hi>Duthas.</hi> To which ſeven Dignities and ſeven Prebendaries, he moreover aſſigned and allotted (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the former Churches and Titles) the Rents and Revenues of the Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:102617:52"/>

            <p>Beſides theſe, he erected thirteen Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains; to the firſt was allotted the Chaplainry of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and he was to be Maſter of the Grammar School: To the ſecond was allotted the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainry of St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> and he was to be Maſter of the Singing-School: The third was to be <hi>Stellarius</hi> or the Biſhop's Choiriſter.

and of the twelve Pounds left by King <hi>James</hi> III. and King <hi>James</hi> IV.

            <p>He moreover ordained ſix Boys, who were to be Taper-bearers, and to ſing the Reſponſories and Verſes in the Choire, as they were to be ordered by the Chanter. Of which ſix Boys, one was to be nominate and maintain'd by the Biſhop; the ſecond by the Preben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary of St. <hi>Magnus;</hi> the third by the Prebendary of St. <hi>John;</hi> the fourth by the Prebendary of St. <hi>Lawrence;</hi> the fifth by the Prebendary of St. <hi>Katharine;</hi> the ſixth by the Prebendary of St. <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thas:</hi> And every one of them was to have, beſides their Maintenance, twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Shillings <hi>Scots</hi> a Year.

The Charter of this erection is dated at <hi>Kirkwal, October</hi> 28. <hi>Anno</hi> 1544; and in the following Year it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by another Charter granted by <hi>David Beaton</hi> Cardinal of St. <hi>Stephen</hi> in <hi>Mount Celio,</hi> and Archbiſhop of St. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews,</hi> having Authority ſo to do.

            <p>In this condition the Church ſtood as long as Popery continued, but the Reformation coming in, and <hi>Robert Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard,</hi> Earl of <hi>Orkney,</hi> having obtain'd the Biſhoprick from Biſhop <hi>Bothwell,</hi> in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change for the Abbacy of <hi>Holyrood-houſe,</hi> he became Lord of the whole Country, and he and his Son Earl <hi>Patrick,</hi> who ſucceeded him, did in the Church what they pleas'd.</p>
            <p>At laſt <hi>James Law</hi> being made Biſhop of <hi>Orkney,</hi> and the Earldom being uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Crown (by the death and forefaulture of the foreſaid <hi>Patrick,</hi> Earl of <hi>Orkney,</hi> as we ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak more of in the 8th Chapter) he, with the conſent of his Chapter, made

The Earl of <hi>Cathnes</hi> and the Lord <hi>Sinclar</hi> came with a great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my by Sea into <hi>Orkney</hi> to have taken poſſeſſion of it, as of a Country to which they pretended ſome Right, but the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Country, under the command of Sir <hi>James Sinclar</hi> (natural Son to <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Sinclar,</hi> the laſt Earl of <hi>Orkney</hi> of that Sirname) encounted the Earl with ſuch courage at a place call'd <hi>Summerſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale,</hi> that his Army was wholly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfited; the Earl himſelf, with 500 of his Men, being killed, and the Lord <hi>Sinclar,</hi> with all the reſt, taken Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. It is ſaid of this Sir <hi>James Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar,</hi> that preſuming on his merits and the good ſervice he had done the King, by that engagement, begg'd of King <hi>James</hi> the Fifth, then Reigning, the Iſles of <hi>Sanda</hi> and <hi>Eda,</hi> which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to him then as ſmall Iſlands, or <hi>Holms,</hi> only ſit for Paſture, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Requeſt obtain'd them; which, I conceive, may be the reaſon why <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanan</hi> does not reckon any of theſe, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Sanda</hi> or <hi>Eda,</hi> amongſt the Iſles of <hi>Orkney,</hi> by being deceiv'd with that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:102617:57"/>
that they were but Holms, whereas they are amongſt the moſt conſiderable Iſlands in this Country; but the King being afterward better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and that he had been impoſed on by Sir <hi>James,</hi> threatned that his Head ſhould pay for it when he came to <hi>Orkney;</hi> for fear of which, when he heard of the King's Arrival, he caſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the Sea, in a place called the <hi>Gloup</hi> of <hi>Linkſneſs,</hi> and was drowned. The King coming in Perſon to this Country to ſettle the Troubles and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions that were in it, was nobly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd by the Biſhop all the time of his ſtay, and having put a Guard in the King's and Biſhop's Caſtles (having firſt viſited ſome of the Weſtern Iſles) he returned to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> taking with him ſome of the Factious Gentry. At this time alſo the Town of <hi>Kirkwall</hi> gave ſuch demonſtrations of their Affection and Loyalty to their King, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time after he ratified their Erection in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Royal Burrough by a new Charter of confirmation <hi>Anno</hi> 1536</p>
            <p n="9">9. To him ſucceeded <hi>Robert Reid</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Orkney,</hi> a very deſerving, Man, of an excellent Wit and great Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:102617:57"/>
He caus'd to be built a ſtately To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to the North end of the Biſhop's Palace, where his Statue in a ſtone is as yet remaining ſet in the Wall. He greatly enlarged the Cathedral Church, adding three Pillars to the former Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick, and decoring the entry with a magnificent Porch. He moreover built St. <hi>Olaus</hi> Church in <hi>Kirkwal,</hi> and a large Court of Houſes to be a College for the inſtructing the Youth of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in Grammar and Philoſophy. He made a new foundation of the Chapter, enlarging the number of Canons, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bendaries, and other Officers, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling large and ample Proviſions on them, as is ſet down in the former Chapter. In a Book Dedicated to him by <hi>Adam Senior,</hi> a Monk of the <hi>Ciſteroian</hi> Order, I find that he had a right to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtries of <hi>Beaulie</hi> and <hi>Kinloſs;</hi> but whether he had theſe as Bishop of <hi>Ork<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> or only in <hi>commendam,</hi> I cannot determine.</p>
            <p>He was in great credit with his Prince King <hi>James</hi> the Fifth, who conſulted him in all his weighty Affairs. In his time he perform'd many Honourable Embaſſages to the Credit and Benefit
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:102617:58"/>
of his Country. Amongſt the reſt he was one of thoſe that accompanied the young Queen <hi>Mary</hi> when ſhe was ſent into <hi>France</hi> to be Married to the <hi>Dolphin</hi> (afterwards <hi>Francis</hi> the ſecond King of <hi>France)</hi> tho' both in his going and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he had bad Fortune; for in his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Ship he was in Periſhed on the Coaſt of <hi>France,</hi> near to <hi>Bulloigne,</hi> the Biſhop and the Earl of <hi>Rothes</hi> that was with him hardly eſcaping by the Ship's Boat: And in his return from the Court of <hi>France</hi> he died at <hi>Diep,</hi> the 14th of <hi>September</hi> 1558; of whom <hi>Ant.

            <p>This Biſhop was a Man of great em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment and action; it was he that Married the Earl of <hi>Bothwel,</hi> then made Duke of <hi>Orkney,</hi> with the Queen in the Palace of <hi>Holyrood-Houſe.</hi> To him Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> when ſhe had reſigned the Crown, gave a Procuration for the inaugurating the Prince her Son; who accordingly, on the 29th of <hi>July</hi> 1567, Crowned and Anointed him in the Church of Sterling: And in the Year following, when the Earl of <hi>Murray</hi> Regent, was to go to <hi>England,</hi> about the debate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the King and his Mother (who was detained Priſoner there.) This Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop was one of thoſe, who, by the

Eſtates of the Kingdom, were Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioned to attend the Regent, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt him in that debate.

            <p>But at what time theſe <hi>Pights</hi> firſt planted theſe Iſles is ſomewhat contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by our Hiſtorians. Some ſay that in the Year of the World 4867, the <hi>Pights</hi> having left their native Country, to ſeek out ſome new Habitation to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, came firſt to <hi>Orkney,</hi> where they left a Colony to plant the Country, and then with their main body Ferrying o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Pightland-Firth,</hi> and paſſing tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough <hi>Cathnes, Roſs, Murray, Marr</hi> and <hi>Angus,</hi> at laſt ſetled themſelves in <hi>Fife</hi> and <hi>Lothian,</hi> which, from them, by our
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:102617:64"/>
Writers, is call'd <hi>Pictlandia.</hi> Others think that the <hi>Pights</hi> did not ſettle here till the time of <hi>Reuther</hi> King of Scots; at which time the Scots by an inteſtine diviſion warring upon one another, each party being aſſiſted by conſiderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the <hi>Pights;</hi> they fought ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperately, that beſides <hi>Gethus</hi> King of the <hi>Pights,</hi> the greateſt number of both the Scots and Pictiſh Nobility were killed, together with many thouſands of the Commons of both Nations; which great ſlaughter, with the Invaſion of the <hi>Britains</hi> at that time, conſtrained the <hi>Pights</hi> (who perceived themſelves unable to reſiſt them) to fly to the more Northern parts of the Kingdom, and ſo to <hi>Orkney,</hi> where they abode for a time, and made <hi>Gothus,</hi> the Brother of the foreſaid <hi>Gethus,</hi> their King; and after ſome years having left ſome few of their number to People and Plant this Country, they returned to <hi>Lothian,</hi> and having expell'd the <hi>Britains,</hi> ſetled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves again in their ancient Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
            <p>This Country being thus planted, the People grew and multiplied, and, for a long time, were governed by Kings
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:102617:64"/>
of their own, after the manner of the <hi>Pights</hi> and other Nations. There is ſtill a place in this Country, that by reaſon of its name and antique Form would ſeem to be the reſidence of ſome of theſe Kings; it is call'd <hi>Coninſgar,</hi> or the King's Houſe; 'tis in the Pariſh of <hi>Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi> in the Mainland; but the memory and actions of theſe Kings are, by the injury of Time and careleſsneſs of our Writers, bury'd in ſilence; ſo that only we find mention made of theſe two, <hi>Belus</hi> King of <hi>Orkney; Holinſhed</hi> calls him <hi>Bladus,</hi> and <hi>Boethius Balus;</hi> but it is more probable he was called <hi>Belus;</hi> for there is at this time ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining a Stone in the Church of <hi>Birſa</hi> (where probably the King had his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal reſidence, as to this day one of the Earls chiefeſt Palaces is remaining) hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this name <hi>Belus</hi> engraven on it in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry odd ancient characters, which has probably been taken from ſome ancient Buildings thereabouts. This Prince, upon what provocation is not recorded, levied an Army, and croſſing <hi>Pight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land-Firth,</hi> Invaded <hi>Cathnes</hi> and <hi>Roſs,</hi> making Prey of all he met with; but <hi>Ewen</hi> the ſecond being at that time King
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:102617:65"/>
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> hearing of this Invaſion, came with his Army ſo unexpectedly upon him, and aſſaulted him ſo vigorou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly, that he put his Soldiers to flight, a great many eſcaping by Boat, but <hi>Belus</hi> himſelf was put to that ſtrait that he ſlew himſelf, leſt he ſhould fall into his Enemies hands.</p>
            <p>After him we read of another King of <hi>Orkney,</hi> call'd <hi>Ganus,</hi> in the time of <hi>Caratacus</hi> King of <hi>Scots;</hi> and of him it is reported, by <hi>Boethius,</hi> that he, with his Wife and Children, were carry'd Captives to <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Claudius Caeſar</hi> when he went from <hi>Britain;</hi> and <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannus Shedel</hi> in his general Hiſtory of the ſeveral Ages of the world, ſpeaking of the Emperor <hi>Claudius,</hi> ſays, <hi>Quod in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulas Orchades Romano adjecit imperio; ſexto quo profectus erat menſe Romam rediit &amp; triumphavit maximo apparatu.</hi> This <hi>Juvenal</hi> takes notice of when he ſays in his ſecond Satyr,</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:102617:65"/>
A little after this the <hi>Romans</hi> had not ſuch cauſe to triumph over <hi>Orkney;</hi> for when <hi>Agricola</hi> was their General in <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Anno Chriſti</hi> 87, as <hi>Henry Iſaacſon</hi> computes it in his Chronological Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; he ſent a Navy to ſail about <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> to diſcover the largeneſs of it, and whether it was an Iſland or not; and after they had coaſted many days to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the North, they came at laſt in ſight of <hi>Orkney</hi> (which <hi>Tacitus,</hi> for want of better information, imagines to be unknown before that time) but fearing to paſs thorough <hi>Pightland-Firth</hi> for fear of Shallows, they ſeized ſome of the Country People that liv'd in the next Iſlands, conſtraining them to go aboard and pilot them thorough the Firth; but they ſuſpecting that the <hi>Romans</hi> had a hoſtile deſign on their Country, not caring for their own Lives, they enter'd the Strait at ſuch an inconvenient time, that the Ships were born with the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the ſtream againſt Rocks and Shelves in ſuch a manner, that they were all almoſt torn, broke and loſt without recovery, only ſome few of the Navy that were not ſo haſty to follow, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the ſad loſs of their fellows, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:102617:66"/>
by the ſame way they came and reported theſe lamentable Tidings to <hi>Agricola:</hi> And indeed there is a place in <hi>Shapinſha,</hi> over againſt which are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous Tides and dangerous Shallows at this day, call'd <hi>Agricola;</hi> but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it got that name from this accident I am not able to determine.</p>
            <p>But yet it ſeems that <hi>Orkney</hi> was a conſiderable thing in the Eyes of the Romans: For <hi>Polyd. Virgil. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Ang. Hiſtoriae,</hi> ſpeaking of the diviſion of the Empire among the Sons of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, reckons <hi>Orkney</hi> amongſt the famous Kingdoms that fell to the ſhare of his Son <hi>Conſtantine;</hi> ſays he, <hi>Huic ſorte evenit Britannia cum Gallia, Hiſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia &amp; Orchadibus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Country it's like continued thus under the Government of their own Princes, till the fatal Ruine and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the Pictiſh Kingdom in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> in the Year 839; at which time <hi>Keneth</hi> the ſecond, that Martial King of Scots having in many Battles over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown the <hi>Picts,</hi> at laſt expell'd them out of all <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſeizing on <hi>Fife</hi> and <hi>Lothian,</hi> and the other large Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries that they had therein; he purſued
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:102617:66"/>
them to <hi>Orkney,</hi> vanquiſhing theſe Iſles and adding them to his other Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Orkney</hi> being thus annex'd to the Crown of <hi>Scotland,</hi> it continued many years under the Government of the Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Kings and their Lieutenants, till about the Year 1099, at which time <hi>Donald Bain,</hi> Lord of the Iſles, having uſurped the Crown, and cauſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be proclaimed King of <hi>Scotland;</hi> and being thereupon hardly put to it by the injur'd Heir and diſcontented Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that he might not loſe what he had unjuſtly uſurped, he invited <hi>Magnus</hi> King of <hi>Norway</hi> to come to his aſſiſtance, with an offer of the Iſles for his pains; who coming with his Navy Invaded <hi>Orkney</hi> and the Weſtern Iſles, putting Garriſons in all convenient places.</p>
            <p>By this means the <hi>Norwegians</hi> got poſſeſſion of this Country, who held it for the ſpace of 164 years, when they came to loſe all again upon this occaſion: <hi>Anno</hi> 1263, <hi>Alexander</hi> the Third being then King of <hi>Scotland, Atho</hi> (by ſome called <hi>Hagin)</hi> King of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> hoping from the diviſions that were then in the Kingdom, and the Famine
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:102617:67"/>
that was then ſore preſſing the Land, to make ſome further conqueſt in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> he comes with a great Navy and Army of <hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>Norwegians</hi> to the Weſt Iſles, and conquers <hi>Arran</hi> and <hi>Bute</hi> (which were the only Iſles at that time under the dominion of the <hi>Scots)</hi> and from this ſucceſs hoping for grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter matters, he lands on the Continent and takes in the Town and Caſtle of <hi>Air.</hi> But King <hi>Alexander</hi> having aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled a great Army, aſſaults him in Battle at <hi>Largis,</hi> kills his Nephew, a Man of great Renown, and after a great Slaughter of his Soldiers (to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of twenty four thouſand) puts the remainder to flight. Immediately upon this defeat King <hi>Acho</hi> hears of another ſad loſs; namely, That his Fleet by a Storm were all caſt away and broken againſt the Rocks, except four in which he preſently embarked and fled away to <hi>Orkney;</hi> being come thither, he ſent to <hi>Norway</hi> and <hi>Denmark</hi> for a new Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and Fleet, with an intention again to Invade <hi>Scotland</hi> the next Summer; but he died the beginning of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Year, <hi>January</hi> 22, <hi>Anno</hi> 1264, and was bury'd in that place where
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:102617:67"/>
the Cathedral now ſtands, under a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Stone which is ſeen to this day, and goes under the name of his Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>After his death King <hi>Alexander</hi> Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the <hi>Iſle of Man,</hi> and the Weſtern Iſles, which, after ſome oppoſition, he recover'd, and intending to make the like attempt for the recovery of <hi>Orkney</hi> and <hi>Zetland;</hi> there came Ambaſſadors to him from <hi>Magnus</hi> King of <hi>Norway</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> who ſucceeded <hi>Acho</hi> in theſe Kingdoms; after ſeveral Treaties it was at laſt condeſcended upon that King <hi>Alexander</hi> ſhould pay to the King of <hi>Norway</hi> the Summ of 4000 Merks Sterling, with the Summ of 100 Merks by year; and that for this <hi>Magnus</hi> King of <hi>Norway</hi> ſhould quit all Right that he might pretend to the Iſles of <hi>Orkney</hi> and <hi>Zetland,</hi> and the other Iſles of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which accordingly he did, by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters under his Great Seal, renouncing and giving over all Right and Claim that he had or might have both for him and his Succeſſors to theſe and all the other Iſles of <hi>Scotland;</hi> and, for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter confirmation hereof, a Marriage was agreed upon betwixt the Lady

               <hi>Margaret,</hi> Daughter to <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Hangonanus</hi> (or <hi>Haningo</hi> or <hi>Aquin</hi> as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers call him) Son to King <hi>Magnus,</hi> both Children, to be completed when they came to a Marriagable Eſtate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Orkney</hi> being in this manner recover'd from the hands of the <hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wegians,</hi> it continued ever after annexed to the Crown of <hi>Scotland;</hi> King <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> giving the property of it to a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleman ſirnamed <hi>Speire,</hi> Earl of <hi>Cathnes,</hi> whoſe Son <hi>Magnus Speire</hi> Earl of <hi>Cath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, Orkney</hi> and <hi>Zetland,</hi> was in great repute in the days of King <hi>Robert Bruce.</hi>

So much was he favour'd by King <hi>Robert</hi> the Third, that when he was to ſend his Son Prince <hi>James</hi> (afterward King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt) to <hi>France,</hi> he appointed this <hi>Henry,</hi> Prince of <hi>Orkney,</hi> to be his Governor, who taking Ship with him at the <hi>Baſs,</hi> came as far as <hi>Flamburgh-head,</hi> but by reaſon of the Sickneſs and Indiſpoſition of the young Prince, they were neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated to land, and ſo were both detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Priſoners by the Engliſh.

of <hi>Holyrood-Houſe,</hi> after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Reformed Church, on the 15th of <hi>May</hi> 1567.

            <p>After the death of <hi>James Hepburn,</hi> Duke of <hi>Orkney,</hi> the Lord <hi>Robert Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>art,</hi> natural Son to King <hi>James</hi> the Fifth, was made Earl of <hi>Orkney</hi> in <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt Anno</hi> 1581; and being before pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided to the Abbacy of <hi>Holyrood Houſe,</hi> he made an exchange of that with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam Bothwell</hi> for the Biſhoprick of <hi>Ork<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> and ſo became ſole Lord of the whole Country.

            </p>
            <p>To him ſucceeded his Son <hi>Patrick Stuart</hi> Earl of <hi>Orkney.</hi> He was a great Oppreſſor of the Country: <hi>Spotſwood</hi>'s character of him is in theſe words. <q>This Nobleman (ſays he) having un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done his Eſtate by Riot and Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality, did ſeek, by unlawful Shifts, to repair the ſame; making unjuſt Acts in his Courts, and exacting Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties for the breach thereof; if any Man was try'd to have concealed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing that might infer a pecunia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mulct, and bring profit to the Earl, his Lands and Goods were declared confiſcated; or if any Perſon did ſue for juſtice before any other Judge than his Deputies, his Goods were eſchea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; or if they went forth of the Iſles without his Licence, or his Deputies, upon whatſoever occaſion, they ſhould forefault their Moveables; and, which of all his acts were moſt inhumane, he ordain'd, That if any Man was try'd to ſupply or give Relief unto Ships, or any Veſſels diſtreſſed by tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt, the ſame ſhould be puniſhed in
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:102617:80"/>
his Perſon, and fined at the Earl's Pleaſure.</q> So far <hi>Spotſwood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Acts produceed by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainers and confeſſed by the Earl him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, were by the King's Privy Council diſcerned unlawful, and the practice thereof prohibited in all times.</p>
            <p>Theſe Oppreſſions moved King <hi>James</hi> the Sixth, that he might deliver theſe injur'd People from ſo great a Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, to purchaſe Sir <hi>John Arnot</hi>'s Right, to whom the Earl had given the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage of his Eſtate, and ſo he took the Country into his own hand, ſending Sir <hi>James Stuart</hi> to it, whom he made Chamberlain and Sheriff of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, who came and took poſſeſſion of the Caſtles of <hi>Kirkwall</hi> and <hi>Birſa</hi> in the King's Name.</p>
            <p>The Earl at this time being Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in the Caſtle of <hi>Dumbarton,</hi> ſent his natural Son <hi>Robert Stuart</hi> with an expreſs Command to retake theſe Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes again; who accordingly did ſo. But the Earl of <hi>Cathnes</hi> being commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by the King to be Lieutenant in theſe bounds, with Order to recover theſe Caſtles and pacify the Country: Shortly after his coming, he took in the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:102617:80"/>
Caſtle of <hi>Kirkwall,</hi> which he demoliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and in it ſeized on the ſaid <hi>Robert Stuart,</hi> with ſome of the Earl's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, whom he ſent to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> where ſhortly after they were hang'd. And the next Year, being <hi>February</hi> the 6th 1614, the Earl himſelf, for ſeveral treaſonable Acts and Oppreſſions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven againſt him (being brought from <hi>Dumbarton</hi> to <hi>Edinburgh)</hi> was there Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed. He was a Man of profuſe ſpending, and the Builder of that beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Fabrick, which afterwards was appropriated to be the Manſe of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of <hi>Orkney.</hi> The King by theſe means being fully poſſeſſed of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, he made Sir <hi>James Stuart</hi> Lord <hi>Ochiltrie</hi> Chamberlain and Sheriff, as is ſaid. After whom others ſucceeded to be Governors in it, till the Year 1647; at what time <hi>William Douglaſs</hi> Earl of <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> got a Wadſet or Morgage of this Country from King <hi>Charles</hi> I.</p>
            <p>To him ſucceeded his Son <hi>Robert Dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſs</hi> Earl of <hi>Morton, Anno</hi> 1649; in which Year the Marquiſs of <hi>Montroſe</hi> came to this Country, from <hi>Holland,</hi> with ſeveral Commanders and ſome Companies of Foreign Soldiers; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:102617:81"/>
ſtaid ſome few Months in <hi>Kirkwall,</hi> he there raiſed ſome Forces, moſt of which were either killed or taken Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners at that unfortunate encounter of <hi>Carberſdale.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To him ſucceeded, in the poſſeſſion of <hi>Orkney</hi> and <hi>Zetland,</hi> his Son <hi>William Douglaſs</hi> Earl of <hi>Morton. Anno</hi> 1664, or thereabouts, in the firſt Dutch Wars, there was a great Ship, call'd <hi>The Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melan of Amſterdam,</hi> caſt away at <hi>Zet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> in which Ship (as was ſaid) were ſome Cheſts of Coin'd Gold, which were ſeiz'd on by ſome who acted for the Earl; whereupon the Lords of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury call'd the Earl to an Accompt, and ſo redeemed the Morgage of <hi>Orkney</hi> and <hi>Zetland,</hi> and obtain'd a Decreet of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarator againſt him; and in the Year 1669, theſe Countries of <hi>Orkney</hi> and <hi>Zet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> thus redeemed from the Earl of <hi>Morton,</hi> were (excepting the Biſhops in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt) re-annexed to the Crown, and erected into a Stewardry by Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>

It will not be amiſs to ſubjoyn to the deſcription of <hi>Orkney,</hi> this Eſſay concerning it.</p>
            <p>Some derive the name <hi>Thule</hi> from the <hi>Arabick</hi> word <hi>Tule,</hi> which ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies farr off, and as it were with allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to this the Poets uſually call it, <hi>ultima Thule,</hi> but I rather preferr the reaſon of the name given by the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Bochartus,</hi> who makes the ſame to be <hi>Phaenician,</hi> and affirmeth that it ſignifieth <hi>Darkneſs</hi> in that language.
