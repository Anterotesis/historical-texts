            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>DEare Brethren, becauſe we are crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tid for gods glory the edification one of another in Chriſt, and are bounde to ſerue thervnto by wealthe or woo, lyfe or death, and cheifly, they to whom God haue geuen the greter gyftes, and whom he hath callyd to higher romes, are moſte bounde to be zelous for gods glory with godly zelouſie to profyt the churche and ſponſe of Chriſte vnder their charge, and that by no ſubteltye as the Apoſtel warnithe, they ſhulde be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted from the ſymplicitie of Chriſt: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is no doubt of your good zealle and diligence. My good fathers &amp; deare bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, who ar firſt callid to the battel, to ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue for gods glory and the edification of his people, againſt the Romiſh reliques and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Antichriſt, I doubt not but that you wyl coragiouſlye and conſtantlye in Chriſt, rape at theſe rages of Gods enemyes, and that you will by this occaſion race vp many as grete enormites that we all know, &amp; labo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re to race out all the dregges &amp; remnants of
<pb facs="tcp:12149:3"/>
tranſformid popery, that are crept into En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, by to much lenite of them that wylbe namid the Lordes of the cleargie: what is he that hath the zeale of gods glory before his face, that wyl not ioyne both in prayer, and in ſufferinge with you, in ſo good a cauſe, that is ſo much for gods glory, and the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacion of gods church, in the pure ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite of Chriſtes word &amp; ſacramentes, wherin our enemies and perſecutours are ſtrangely bewitchid. I wote not by what Circes cupe, that they do make ſuche a diuerſite betwixt Chriſtes worde &amp; his ſacramentes, that they can not thinke the worde of God ſafelye y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noughe preachid, &amp; honorably inough hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyd, without cap, cope, ſurplis. But that the ſacraments the maryinge, the buryinge, the churching of wemen, &amp; other church ſeruice, as they call it, muſte nedes be decored with croſſinge, with capping, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſurpleſſing, with knelinge, with preti wafer cakes, and other knackes of poperi. O Paule that thou were a lyue, thou durſt tell thoſe politike gentel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that ther hath bin to much laboure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoued vpon them in vaine, thou durſte ſay vnto them, as thou dideſt to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Corinthians, that they eat not the Lordes ſupper, but pley a pagent of their owne to blynde the people, and kepe them ſtill in ſuperſticion, fare from the ſymplicite of Chriſtes ſupper: but howe
<pb facs="tcp:12149:3"/>
many ſely ſowles is ther that dothe beleue veryly, that they haue an Engliſh maſſe, and ſo put no difference betwene truth &amp; falſhod, betwene Chriſt and antichriſt, betwene God and the deuell, they are ſtrangely bewitched. I ſay that thus wyll bynde theyr Englyſhe preſthode &amp; ſacraments, but muche more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chauntid that can fynd no garments to plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſe them. But ſuch as haue ben polutid open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with popiſhe ſuperſticion &amp; Idolatry, but moſt of all in this point ſhall theyr madnes apere to all poſterites, that they make theſe Antichriſtian rages <hi>Cauſam ſine qua non,</hi> that is, a cauſe without which ther is no holy mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery in Chriſt, ſo that this ſhall make an Englyſhe preſte, be he neuer ſuche a dolt or vnlearnid in the knouledge of the ſcripture as we haue very manye, and without theſe romiſſhe reliques not Paule hym ſelfe ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be admittid (as one of them dyd blaſpheme &amp; the reſt of them in effecte do affirme) well agaynſte ſuche popiſhe chaffer and popery, hathe byne longe agone foughten witheall, when the gret captaines of that religion ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyd, and yet God gaue the victory. Therfor let vs not fear now, although it doth begine to ſture agayn, for ther is no craft, conninge, counſell, wyſdom, or policy againſt the Lord. We haue Chriſt &amp; hys Apoſtells &amp; the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes euer ſtryuing agaynſt the Ipocrites
<pb facs="tcp:12149:4"/>
of their time on our ſyde. a ſtran for popiſhe polici we haue the worde of God to warant vs, to rote out al monuments of ſuperſticion and Idolatry, &amp; are charged to abhor them, to accompt them, accurſed, and to defy them, and to deteſt them as menſtreous clowtes, they haue not the worde of God for them. And what wyſdom is in them, ſayth god by his Prophet Jeremi, they talke of obedience &amp; concorde, but ther is no obedience againſt the Lorde, no nor concorde to be deſired, but wher gods glory and verite is preſerued, Els better to haue al the worlde in hurly burleis, and heauen &amp; earth to ſhake, then one ioyte of gods glory ſhulde decaie. So far forth as in vs leithe, we haue theyr owne lawes and proclamacions, to rote out all monuments of ſuperſticion and Idolatrye, &amp; theyr oune wordes are contrarye to theyr doinges. Yt ſhulde apere that they repent their reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion proclamid, as did y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Iſralites, they buyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de agayn that which ons they haue diſtroied and this is doue openlye that all the worlde may wonder, and behold: but what is done ſecretlye, god wyll one daye haue it declarid openly, ye they make the name of god &amp; this doctrine that we profeſſe to be euell ſpoken of alredy. By many of theyr doinges, theyr iudgement haſteth that for ſuch cauſes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute Gods true preachers. Wherfor let vs

not feare theyr threteninges, ther can none perſecute the godly for this cauſe &amp; traſſhe. but ether ſuch as are nether hote nor colde, and then they ſhalbe vomyted out vnleſſe their zeale encreaſe, or ſuch as haue no God before their eies, whoſe god is their bellie, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Firſt we can not caſt of all doubtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, hauing ſo many reaſons on our ſyde, and ſo manye examples bothe of learnyd men, and beſt reformyd Churches, but in all thinges moſt indifferent. Saint Paule chargith euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be certanly perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyd in his owne mynde, which ſome men vntruly tranſlate, Let euery man abownde in his owne ſence, for he that with doubt of conſcience eatyth, which of it ſealfe is

Thyrdlye, we maye not altogether neclecte what infy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dells iudge of vs in the vſynge of thinges lawfull by them ſealfes, and therefore S.
