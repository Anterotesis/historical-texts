            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT has been obſerved, that nothing has been ſo deſtructive to the Peace and Repoſe of Mankind, as thoſe monſtrous Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in Matters of Religion: and that meek, gentle, and pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceable Chriſtian Religion has been prevaricated by the Devil's Malice and Mens Luſts, to be the cauſe of moſt dreadful Heats and Animoſities. Amongſt all eonteſts of that nature, none has been ſo long continued, and with that Warmth Vigour and Activity, as that between Chriſt and Antichriſt. For <hi>Popery</hi> as it was founded in Blood, Treaſon, and Treachery, ſo it has been propagated and maintained by a continual <hi>Series</hi> of more then Devilliſt Cruelties and cunningneſs; It has interwoven it ſelf with the Pollices of all the States in <hi>Europe,</hi> and linked moſt of the Crowns of <hi>Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> to its Intereſt. But herein it has moſt eminently outſtriped all the other implacable Enemies of God, that it has uſurped an abſolute Juriſdiction over mens Souls and Conſciences; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by debauch't them ſo far, as to think the blackeſt Crimes to be <hi>Meritorious Acts,</hi> and to boggle at no <hi>Villany,</hi> though never ſo hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid, for the Advantages of the <hi>Romiſh Sea</hi>; nay, what is more, think that therein they do God good Service. And though Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Juſtice has eminently declared it ſelf againſt them and their Practices by various Methods and Diſpenſations; as ſometimes by hanging up as it were, ſome of the <hi>Notorious Malefactors</hi> in Chains, and making them publick Monuments of his Severity; yet ſo hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and blinded have they been by their Sin, ſo miſled by a villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Crew of Canting and lying Prieſts and Fryars, that they have realy believed, that the Penalty inflicted on them for their bloody Villanies, has been their <hi>Martyrdom.</hi> We ſee the Devil may have <hi>Martyrs</hi> as well as God. Among Inſtances of this kind, was that lamentable Object, that deſerves our great pity, who was execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted lately on <hi>Tower-Hill</hi> for his Helliſh Treaſons. He was a Peer of this Realm, and nobly deſcended, very conſiderable as to Eſtate, and allied to many great Families; no doubt, he had <hi>Gentility</hi> run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in his Veins, having derived it from his great Anceſtors. But obſerve the damnable perniciouſneſs of the <hi>Romiſh Religion,</hi> whoſe bloody Principles and Tenets he having once ſuckt in, thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in Conſcience oblieged to violate all Laws, both Sacred and Humane, to lay aſide all Loyalty and Gratitude towards his Prince; of whoſe Royal Bounty and Favours he had in a ſpecial manner ſo largely and ſo frequently taſted, and under whoſe gracious Government he and his Fraternity lived ſo ſecurely and peaceably, and enjoyed very quietly without any moleſtation, the exerciſe of their Religion notwithſtanding; nay, had many ſevere Laws to the contrary, ſeveral Advantages above ſeveral of other his Majeſties <hi>Proteſtant Subjects</hi>; and yet maliciouſly to conſpire to Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſſinate ſo good a Prince, ſo gracious to him in particular, and to bring a ſtorm of Ruine and Confuſion on his native Land, O mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous and more than Deviliſh Villany!</p>
            <q>Tantum Religio potuit ſuadere malorem.</q>
            <p>But for all theſe infernal Treaſons and Conſpiracies, he was at laſt brought to publick Juſtice, and after a fair Tryal, was caſt by the Lords his Judges, where he received the following Sentence from the Mouth of the Lord High Steward in <hi>Weſtminiſter-Hall,</hi> December the 7<hi>th.</hi> 1680.</p>
            <p>The Judgment of the Law is, and this Court doth accord, you go to the place from whence you came, from thence you muſt be drawn on a <hi>Hurdle</hi> to the place of Execution; when you come there, you muſt be hanged up by the Neck, but not till you are dead, for you muſt be cut down alive, your privy Members muſt be cut off, your Bowels ript up before your Face, and thrown into the Fire. Then your Head muſt be ſevered from your Body, and your Body divided into four Quarters, and thoſe muſt be at the diſpoſal of the King, and Almighty God be merciful to your Soul.</p>
            <p>After Sentence pronounced, the Lord High Steward told the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, that the <hi>Houſe of Lords</hi> in conſideration of his Quality, do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to move the King to pardon all the reſt of the Execution of his Sentence, except only the taking off his Head: Which his Majeſty was graciouſly pleaſed to grant:</p>
            <p>And he was Executed accordingly by ſevering his Head from his Shoulders.</p>
            <p>And we will do him the Honour to give him this <hi>Elegy.</hi>
