            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

power, or after the opinion
of the Epicures, say as the thing indéede
is, that God neither worketh any thing
by instruments, but wyllyngly, nor yet
suffereth the instrumentes to worke,
but wyllingly, yet in suche forte that
what soeuer hee worketh, hee worketh
most iustly and what soeuer he permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
or suffreth he most iustly suffereth.</p>

his owne worke: and permitteth or suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth
in respecte of the worke that the

accorde worke, or in so farre as they are
actiue and not passiue instrumentes,
that wée may keepe the termes vsed in
the scholes. Yet doth God iustly suffer
the thing that these instrumentes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iustly
worke for because that sinnes, in
so farre as they are suffered by God
that wylleth, are not sinnes: but punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes
of sinne. For with God it is a
iust thing to punish sinnes with sinnes.
But these selfe same actions in so farre
as they come from Sathan, and euyll
men prouoked by Sathan and their
owne concupisence or lust, are so farre
sinnes, which the Lord in his time doth
iustly punish. For the Lord doth neuer
suffer sinnes so far as they are sinnes,
nay he doth alwayes forbid them.</p>
            <p>¶Neyther is this consequence or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="32"/>
reason good: God wylleth all thinges,
therefore he aloweth all things. For he
wylleth many thinges, and therefore
<pb facs="tcp:13555:92"/>
suffereth them, not because hée simplye
aloweth of them, but after a certaine
sort, for he aloweth them, so farre as hee
suffereth them, euen so farre as they are
no sinnes, as we sayde euen nowe: But
he disaloweth &amp; punisheth them, so farre
as he hath respect or loketh vnto the euyl
instrumentes, whose actions they are.</p>

               </gap>Hereas three yeeres
ago, dearely beloued. I did
write of this matter of
Election &amp; Reprobation,
whiche is called Predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
in a certayn Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarie
vpon the Prophet <hi>Malachie,</hi>
by the occasion of this text:</p>

The whiche Treatise by the rage of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution,
partly perished, and part dyd
come of late to my handes: accompting
this doctrine so necessarie, that vppon all
occasions it ought with reuerence to bee
vttred to the glory of God, whiche so won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully,
appeareth in this his riche mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
towarde vs, whome he chooseth from
the fylthe of sinne, to serue him in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,
and to the beating downe of our
corrupt nature, whiche without this, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth by pride, vnto presumption,
<pb facs="tcp:13555:107"/>
or falleth by infidelyty to desperation. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that without some taste of this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
prouidence in Predestination, there
can bee no fayth, but eyther a doubtfull
wauering, leading to dispayre, which wée
haue lefte in the Papisterye wyles wée
looked to our owne weakenesse and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie,
not able to endure one houre in
the way of righteousnesse: or else a vayne
presumption of feyned holynesse, whyles
wee beeholde our owne beleefe and good
works, or the perfection that we doo ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
in our owne selues, as doo the Anna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptistes.
Therefore I thoughte it good
according to my simple Talent, to testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
this truthe agayne vnto the worlde,
at the Printing of this worthy Table of
the great lerned man, <hi>Master Beza,</hi> which
is set forth in French, Latin, and Italian,
and now into Englyshe, translated by our
brother <hi>VV. VVhittingham:</hi> wherein
is most euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ntly set forth before our eies
the chyefe ground of this doctryne, and the
principall poyntes thereof are so deepely
opened, that there seemed to wante no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that was possible in fewe lynes to
<pb facs="tcp:13555:107"/>
be vttered, yet for the shortnesse therein
all thinges can not be conteyned, but that
some briefe lessons for the vnlearned (who
hath not theyr sences fully exercised wyth
such déepe sentences) may well be adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
as euery man hereafter shall héere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto
be moued by the spirit of God wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
in their hartes (that many bearing
wytnesse to the truthe of this most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
doctrine nowe reuealed) the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of God in choosing his chyldren, may
more and more, daye by daye be disclosed:
and by the witnesse of dyuers consentyng
togyther in one, God the father of our
Lord Iesus Christ may be gloryfyed. For
heerein chyefly standeth his prayse, honor,
and glory, that these his wonderfull mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyes
toward hys Electe maye be praysed.
Nowe there is no meane more apte, nor
doctrine more conuenient to establysh the
fayth of the Sayncts, than to certyfye by
the Scryptures, that God hath chosen
them before the begynnyng of the world<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the eternall purpose: bicause it is God
that iustifieth, and who dare condempne
them? It is Christ that is giuen for them,
&amp; how shall not all things with him be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen

the iustifycation of fayth wrought in their
heartes by the holy spirite, they can no

saluation, or glorifycation. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can any thing more beate downe
mans nature, and the pride of his vayne

making them by grace so farre vnlyke

of whom the Lord pronounceth that
he loueth the one, &amp; hateth the other, before
they were borne, and the terrible sentence

affyrmeth that God raysed vp to shewe
vppon him his power, and hardened hys
hart, to make his name knowne, and such
like, which euery where are set before our
eyes, to cause man to fall downe before
God, and to feare his iudgementes.

of the Gospell is lykewise slaundered by
the euill conuersation of others: yet may
we not prohibite the sweete floures from
the Bées, bicause Spiders sucke thence
their poyson, no more than wée maye
stoppe the sunne to shyne, bycause it
<pb facs="tcp:13555:109"/>

            <p>Wherefore by the good wyll of God, we
entende to speake of this greate matter,
none other wayes, neyther in any other
sorte, then the open Scriptures shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue

the holy Apostle Sayncte <hi>Paule:</hi> Blessed

chyldren by Iesus Christ. <hi>Ephes.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi> And
thoughe there come some wycked men,
<pb facs="tcp:13555:109"/>
whiche were long before apoynted to this
iudgement, whiche doo turne the grace of
our God to lasciuiousnesse &amp; wantonnesse,
as holy Iude saythe: yet knowe wée that
wée are chosen by Iesus Christe that the
glory of his grace, hys fauour and mercy
towards vs might be praysed. For we are
the electe and chosen kyndred, and hys
people by purchase, that we shoulde shewe
the vertue of him whiche hath called vs
foorth of darknesse into this maruellous
lyght.</p>
            <p>This people ordayned to saluation only
beleeueth. <hi>Act. 13.</hi> For this Electe people
onely was Christ sent into this world. To
them onely is the worde of saluation sent,
as <hi>Peter</hi> sayth: To the Elect by the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
of God the Father. <hi>1. Pet. 1.</hi>
Then to know what this election of God
is, and what in the Scriptures it doth sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifye.
We describe and define election to
bée the frée choyce of the good wyll of the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God, appoynting and prescribing
in the booke of lyfe before the begynning
of the worlde, whome he wyll haue to bée
saued, and coumpted amongest the iust.
<pb facs="tcp:13555:110"/>
Whome hée will haue holy and without
faulte before him to be his children, by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption
to set forth his glory. This choyse,
his choosing, this aforeappoynted purpose
and ordinaunce of God, is aboundauntlye
set forthe in the first chapter to the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians.</hi>
That this commeth of the free wil of
God and his onely grace, freely without
our deseruing (contrary to the vayne opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the Papists and Anabaptists) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

most euidently, the Lord in his maiestie,
speaking to his seruant <hi>Moyses. Exod. 33.</hi>
declared all this to stande of his mercy,
saying, I will haue mercy vpon whome it

it shall be my pleasure, for so is the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

               </gap>he children were borne, when
<pb facs="tcp:13555:110"/>
they had neyther done good nor bad, that
the purpose of God whiche is by Election
mighte stande, it was sayde to hir, not for
the cause of workes, but by the grace of the
caller, the elder shal serue the younger. As
it is written, saythe hée: <hi>Iacob</hi> I loued,
but <hi>Esau</hi> I hated. Of the booke of lyfe,
<hi>Moyses</hi> speaketh, <hi>Exod. 32.</hi> And Christ
himselfe, <hi>Luk, 10.</hi> Saying to his Apostles:
Ioy you and be glad, for your names are
written in the booke of life in the heauens.
And in the. 69. <hi>Psalme</hi> it is spoken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the wicked. Let them not be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

of the booke of life. And agaynst the false
Prophet. Ezechiel. 13. Hée shall not bee in
the counsaile of my people, nor written in
the booke of the house of <hi>Israell.</hi> There
be two finall causes also of this eternall
purpose of the election, the whiche <hi>Paule</hi>
rehearseth in the first chapter to the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesians,</hi>
the one toucheth God, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
perteyneth to man. He hath El<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>c<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
vs bee fore the foundations of the
worlde (sayth the Apostle) that wée mighte
be holy &amp; without blame. And this an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
<pb facs="tcp:13555:111"/>
the wicked, which woulde abuse the
mercies of God to their lust. Againe it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.
He hath Predestinate vs, that he
myght choose vs to be his chyldren, that
his name may be praysed. And this stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth
the mouthes of all our aduersaryes
that saye, that this doctrine is not to the
prayse of God: so that they must cease to
sclaunder this doctrine, vnlesse they wyll
hynder the glory of God, and denye the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
Scriptures.</p>
            <p>Now it is to bée noted and marked dyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently,
that this worde election is taken
after two sortes in the Scripture, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes
as it sygnifyeth absolutely the free
choyse, wyll, and appoyntment of God,
without the respecte of the reuelation of
the worde and message of saluation. And
thus speaketh the holy Apostle Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
of Election, saying of the carnall Iacob:
They were enimyes concerning the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
for your cause, but concerning the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection,
they are beloued for their parents.
For the gyftes of God, and his calling are
suche, that he can not repent. Euen as
you once were mysbeléeuers from God,
<pb facs="tcp:13555:111"/>
but nowe haue attayned mercy, by theyr
mysbeléefe, that they should attayne mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
also.</p>
            <p>This Election expresseth absolutely
the secret purpose of God, without the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of reuelation of the woorde, or any of
our workes following. Under this first
kinde of Election were those hundreth
and twentye thousande, whiche God
dyd choose and kéepe vnto hymselfe in
<hi>Niniuie</hi> amongst the Idolaters, and the
seuen thousande which God dyd leaue for
himselfe in Israell, in the third booke of
<hi>Kings</hi> the. 19. chap. Yea, those that yet are
not, are thus elect, chosen and amongst al
nations both Iewes in this long blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
&amp; banishmente from their cuntrey a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the Turkes in theyr Idolatrous
wickednes, yea amongst the <hi>Edomites,</hi> the
<hi>Sabees,</hi> the <hi>Indians,</hi> and <hi>Ethiopians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in the late blyndnesse of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pishe
church, wherein wee togither wyth
our fathers were altogether Idolatrous,
all Hypocrites and counterfaite Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
thys absolute Election whereby the
mercyfull Lord God did reserue and kepe
<pb facs="tcp:13555:112"/>
his chosen vnto hym in all places, all
ages, all countreys, without respect of
personnes dyd most euydently appeare.
Howbeit this secreete of Election must

               </gap>ee lefte to the Maiestie of God,
where, when, howe, and whome he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
saueth and sheweth his mercy. For,
to the blynde iudgement of man all these
people rehearsed, and suche lyke seemeth
reiect, reprobate and cast awaye, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
by <hi>Ionas</hi> condempning the <hi>Nini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uites,</hi>
by <hi>Elias</hi> condempning the <hi>Israelites,</hi>
and a long whyle, vntyll God had by my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
from Heauen delyuered hym from
that errour, vnto the chyefe Apostle
<hi>Peter,</hi> iudging all the Gentyles to bee a

thanke God that he hath chosen you from
the begynning, by the sanctifying of the
spyrite and the beleefe of the trueth, to the
which he hath called you by our Gospell,
to attayne the glorye of our Lorde Iesus
Christ. By this gratious election was
<hi>Iacob</hi> dearelye beloued in his Mothers
wombe, and <hi>Ieremie</hi> knowne vnto God
before hée was fashioned in his Mothers
wombe. <hi>Ieremie. 1.</hi> And to bee short, all
other the Electe of God are thus chosen,
sanctified, and beloued from the begyning
from before the foundations of the world,
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euerlasting to euerlasting. For there
is no chaunge of tyme with God, seeing
that all thinges are present in his syght.
For vnto him a thousande yeares are but
<pb facs="tcp:13555:113"/>
one day, but the course &amp; change of times
are in vs, our déedes, our knowledge, in
mans chaungeable wisdome.</p>
            <p>This Election must of necessitie driue
downe the pryde wée haue of our owne
strength, our owne power, our owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
our owne frée wil, our owne merites,
our owne iustification of our owne wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes,
and bryng vs to the feelynge of the
mighty power of God, which worketh all
in all things, to the restoring of all things
in our Christ, both in Heauen and Earth,
by whome wée are called into this state,
long before appointed accordyng to his
purposed pleasure, by whose power all
things are wrought, that we may boldly
say wyth the Apostle, who dare laye any
thing to the charge of the Elect of God? It
is God that iustifieth, who is hée that can
condemne? Who can seperate vs (whiche
are this chosen <hi>Iacob</hi>) from the loue of
God.</p>
            <p>Can affliction? Can anguish? Can perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution?
Can hunger? Can nakednes? Can
peryll? Can the sword? For I am perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
sayeth he, that neyther death nor life,
<pb facs="tcp:13555:113"/>
nor Angel, nor power, nor things present,
eyther thinges to come, neyther heyght,
nor depth, neyther any creature can sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the loue of God in Christ Iesu
our Lorde. Loe, this is the loue wherwith
the Lorde loueth his <hi>Iacob,</hi> whereby we
saye: O heauenly Father, Lord of heauen
and earth, it hath pleased thée that thou
myght shewe thy great goodnesse most ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally
and freely towards vs, before that
we were, and therfore before we had done
eyther good or euyl, without any our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rytes
or deseruinges onely through thy
frée mercy to elect and choose, ordaine and
appoint vs heyres of euerlasting lyfe, and
thereby to make all things pertayning to
our saluation, so fyrme and sure, that they
cannot stagger, wauer, nor fayle. Where
contrariwise if they dyd hang of our wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynesse,
we should euer be doubtfull, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
euery man is a lyar, &amp; al our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
is lyke a spotted cloath, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but counterfayte hypocrisie, wayed
in the ballaunce of thy seuere iustice. But
the grace of this thy frée Election maketh
vs most certaine &amp; sure, séeing no creature
<pb facs="tcp:13555:114"/>
is able to take out of thy hande, O God.
Wherefore wée doo lawde and magnifye
thy name, worlde without ende. So bee
it.</p>
            <p>Now after this doctrine of election, and
loue of God towarde <hi>Iacob,</hi> the hating and
Reprobation of <hi>Esau,</hi> must lykewise be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
and though the aduersaries of this
doctrine doo seeme to denie that there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
such Reprobation of the wycked, yet
the wordes are so plaine in <hi>Malachie</hi> and
<hi>Romanes. 9.</hi> that nothing can be more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident.
For what can be more plainely
spoken for this purpose, then that God

ouer them, that they can not fall, but vnto
the glorye of God, and theyr owne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity,
<pb facs="tcp:13555:114"/>
and by the course of the contraries
compared together in that <hi>Psalm:</hi> it should
be added, the Lord knoweth not the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
like as Christ sayth it shall bée answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
vnto them, I knowe you not: the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
parte of the verse is that the way
of the wicked shall perishe, so that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
to bee all one, not to bee elected,
accepted, and knowne of God, and to
perish, and to be as a Reprobate condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
And <hi>Felinus</hi> foorthe of <hi>Kimhy</hi> doth
note, that that parte of the laste verse of
the. 2. <hi>Psalme:</hi> God beeing angrye, you
shall perishe foorthe of the waye, dothe
expounde this of the fyrste <hi>Psalme,</hi> so
that the Election, knowledge, loue, and

reprobation and condemnation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
doo followe, in <hi>Caine, Esau, Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rao,
Iudas,</hi> the Pharisées, and lyke obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
persons, so manifestly vttering them
selues to bée of that sort whome God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
hated: The chyldren not of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
but as Christ answereth vnto them,
of their father the deuyl, who was a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer
<pb facs="tcp:13555:115"/>
from the begynning, lyke as his
chyldren haue bene also euer syth the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynning
of the world, and therefore must
of necessitie be hated of the most mercifull
Lorde, who is compelled by the order
of his workes, to vse these wicked roddes
and cruel scourges, for the chastisement of
his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, doing many times the works
straunge from his nature, that he may doo
his worke of his mercy, peculyar vnto his
nature: And than vtterly breake, hate, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect,
and cast away into euerlasting fyre &amp;
vtter destruction this rodde and scourge,
lyke a most merciful Father, fauoring his
children and hating the rodde. Lyke as he
sayth by his prophet: Woo vnto <hi>Assur</hi> the
rodde of my fury, and the staffe of my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation,
and after promyseth to breake
the staffe and cast away the rodde. <hi>Psal. 10.</hi>
Suffering in the meane season, yet these
instruments of his wrath prepared vnto
destruction, with great patience, for this
ende that he maye vtter the ryches of his
glory, towards the vessels of glory, which
he hath prepared vnto glory.</p>
            <p>Thus was <hi>Pharao</hi> the manifest scourge
<pb facs="tcp:13555:115"/>
and rodde of God, to correct, to chastice, &amp;
to exercyse the Israelytes, and to spreads
the power of God through all the worlde.
Therefore was <hi>Moyses</hi> sent vnto him,
with the rodde of God his mighty mercy,
to breake in sunder this rodde of chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
And the Lorde sayd vnto <hi>Moyses,</hi>
I haue appoynted thée to bée the God of
<hi>Pharao,</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> thy brother shall be
thy Prophete, thou shalt speake vnto him
all that I commaunde thée. And he shall
speake vnto <hi>Pharao,</hi> to let go the chyldren
of Israel forth of his lande. But I wyll
harden his harte, sayeth the Lorde, and I
wyll, multyplie my sygnes and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders

<hi>Exod 12.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe the Lorde sayth, Nowe shall
I stretche my hande to stryke thée, and
thy people with a plague, and thou shalt
peryshe from the earth, for therefore
haue I caused thée to stande (for so is
<pb facs="tcp:13555:116"/>
the Hebrewe worde) that I maye shewe
in thée my strength, and that my name
maye bée renowned through all the earth.
<hi>Exod 9.</hi> Then the Lorde sendeth a great
hayle, so that feelyng the hande of God the
tenth tyme, <hi>Pharao</hi> was compelled to
crye: The Lorde is iuste, and I and my
people are synners, as followeth in the
same Chapter. Yet for all this the Lorde
hardeneth his harte, that hée pursueth the
chyldren of Israel to his owne destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<hi>Exod. 14.</hi> So that resysting the power
of God, he perysheth in this worlde, and
in the worlde to come, hee is appoynted
to the euerlasting fyre, prepared for the
Deuyll and his Angelles, by the iust
iudgement of the almighty Lorde: who
being refused and so openly resysted, iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
doeth geue ouer the wycked to theyr
owne Reprobate myndes, with greedy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to fulfyll theyr fleshlie desyres, and

lyfe long, workes deseruing the wrath
of God against the daye of his wrath and
vengeaunce, as the Apostle sayth to the
<hi>Romaines.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Reprobation then is the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of God his seuere iustice and iust
iudgement, against the Serpent and his
séede, whome, by the worde of his eternall
wisedome hée hath accursed from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynning,
and appoynted to euerlasting
torment. The which worke necessarie for
the procéeding of God his holy prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
Eternall and neuer ceasing regyment,

of the wyll of the myghtie God, which is
the verie lawe, equity, and iustice it selfe,
frée from all affections, farre from all
faulte, cryme or sinne: It ought to bee
knowne vnto vs all, that all fleshe maye
tremble, and consider before whome it
standeth, euen before that great Lord and
mighty God, who hath power both ouer
the bodie and Soule to cast into hell fyre.
To whome no man may saye: what doest
thou? Being lyke the claye in the Potters

<pb facs="tcp:13555:117"/>
of the smyter. Who offendeth against no

know the lawe, to follow his wyl, is to doo
the lawe, so that of necessitye this great
Lorde is so farre &amp; frée from al sinne, that
nothing is good but that which is wrought
by him, nothing can be euyll that he wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth

There be two things especially which doo
séeme to stande against this doctrine of
Election and Reprobation, or of God his
gouernaunce and prouidence, for all is
one in effect, the one toucheth God, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
man. The fyrst and pryncipall is,
leaste that the wicked doo make God the
Aucthour of synne in the Reprobate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the
which doubt, we maye remoue fowre ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of wayes.</p>
            <p>Fyrst, by the aucthoritie of Scriptures.
Secondlye, by the testimonie of theyr
own consciences which be the reprobate.
Thirdly, by the nature of sinne. Fowrth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
by the maiestie of God, which is bound
to none of his creatures, to make hym
this or that vessell. For the fyrst, Saint
<hi>Iames</hi> sayeth: Let no man saye when he
is tempted, that he is tempted of God,
for God, as he can not bée tempted with
euyll, so neyther doeth hée tempte any
man. But euerye man is tempted,
<pb facs="tcp:13555:122"/>
drawne awaye, and entysed of his owne
luste and concup<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>scence. Then the luste
when it hath conceyued, bryngeth foorth
synne. <hi>Iames. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi> And euen thus it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
in the fyrste fall of mankynde.
Fyrste, though the Lorde our God had
warned and commaunded the contrary,
oure olde enemye styrreth the concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence
and lust of the Woman, with the
goodnesse, pleasauntnesse and beautie of
the Apple, then her lust conceyuing this,
bringeth foorth synne, entysing also her
husband, to the breaking of God his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes.
<hi>Genes. 3.</hi> But contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rywise,
sayeth <hi>Iames</hi> in the same place.
<hi>Iam. 1.</hi> least you should erre and conceyue
any euyll opinion of God, euery good gyfte
and euerie perfyte gyfte is from aboue,
descending from the Father of lyght, with
whom is no variablenesse, neither change
into darkenesse, that hée shoulde geue
nowe good things, nowe euyll, now lyght,
nowe darkenesse. No, sayth the Apostle
<hi>Paule,</hi> let God be true, and all men lyars.
Can God be vniust? Howe shall he then
iudge the worlde? <hi>Rom. 3.</hi> Againe, God
<pb facs="tcp:13555:123"/>
sayeth by his Prophete <hi>Ezechiel:</hi> I wyll
not the death of a sinner, but I wyl rather
that the sinner conuert, repent and lyue.
And vnto wicked Ierusalem sayth our sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
Christ: O Ierusalem, Ierusalem,
which slayest the Prophetes, and stonest
them that are sent vnto thée: Howe ofte
would I haue gathered together thy chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
as the Hen gathereth her Chickins
vnder her wings, and thou wouldest not.
Loe, thy house therefore is left desolate.
<hi>Mat. 23.</hi> Loe, héere appeareth the goodnesse
of the lyuing Lord, so dillygently callyng
the wicked to him by his worde, by his
Prophetes, by his messengers, and at the
length by his owne sonne, that he can not
in any case be accoumpted the Aucthor of
theyr euyl, nor cause of theyr fal. But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
wise, theyr owne wylfull and wyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
stubbernesse is the cause of their euyl,
and the onely occasion of theyr fall, as it is
written: Thy perdition and destruction is
of thine owne selfe, but onely of me is thy
saluation. And infinite scriptures to the
same purpose appertayning. That wée
may saye with <hi>Daniel:</hi> vnto thée O Lord,
<pb facs="tcp:13555:123"/>
belongeth ryghteousnesse, and to vs the
shame and couering of our faces. <hi>Daniel. 9.</hi>
Secondly, The testimony of the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
of the wycked, which shall accuse or

of the force and valure of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sande

of theyrs shall condempne the wycked,
and what shall God then doo? Or wherein
is his dreadfull maiestie to bée charged?
<hi>Caine</hi> by his owne conscience, is compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

must hyde mée from thy face. Loe, the iust
iudgement of God, and his worthy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempnation,
openly confessed. Who dare
then blame God? <hi>Caine</hi> dare in no wyse

and I and my people are wycked. <hi>Exo. 9.</hi>

he is compelled to take aduengaunce, and
execute a iudgement moste terryble a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him selfe, vttering to all the world
him selfe most wicked, and that the iustice
of God, punishing suche wycked Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours

throughout the whole worlde.
Lyke as all the other wycked and despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate

there is a iust Lorde, the God of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
whome they doo feare, and before

him of any sinne, but rather taking

and bodyes. Thus must God alwayes
bée founde iust, and ouercome when he is

let no man be so foolyshe to saye, that God
is the Author of euyll, vnlesse he wyll bée

the man, as Christ our master sayth,
<hi>Math. 15.</hi> And therefore are onely to bée
accompted sinne. No such thought can bée
attrybuted or ascrybed vnto God, as can
be against his wyll, therefore no sinne
can bée his worke. Neyther can he bée
the Aucthour of euyll, which therefore
is called God, because he is the Aucthour
and geuer of all good, and so farre from
<pb facs="tcp:13555:125"/>
euyll, that he turneth all our euyll to some
good, our sinne to the vttering of his grace,
our lyes to the declaration of his trueth.
No, this is the perfit workemaster which

I pray you, may not this Lorde thus
vse his owne seruauntes, without any
blame of sinne, seeing that hée hath crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and made them all onely to serue
hys glorye, hys iustice, and hys mercye.
Or howe can hee bee vniuste, or the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour

If he withholde it from any, his dreadfull

to be nothing without God: what blame
deserueth God, or who dare accuse hym?

Elect they are most necessarie prickes and

witnesse. To the Reprobate they are te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies
of the good wyll of the almighty

resisted, and refused, and reiected, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordinge
to the saying of oure Sauioure
Christ: If I had not come and spoken to
them, they had had no sinne, but nowe
they haue no pretence or excuse for theyr
sinne. Paraduenture you wyll answere
<pb facs="tcp:13555:128"/>
mée: They can not obey vnto it. What
is the cause thereof I pray you? bicause
they lacke the spirite of Christe to leade
them, you wyll say: I dare easily graunt
you, but wyll they graunt this? wyll they
(thinke you) submite them selues vnder
poore Christe, and the foolyshnesse of the
crosse, and not rather boast and brag their
wisedome, their knowledge, and their vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
dealyng, and righteousnesse. Are not
these the men that dare thus boast? Wée
knowe as well as the Preacher can tell
vs. Is the spirite of God departed from
vs to speake with him? As was sayde to
<hi>Micha. 2.</hi> of the <hi>Kings. 22.</hi> chapter. Or as
the Pharisies did answere vnto Christe:
are we blynde? To whome our Sauiour
sayth agayne: If you were blinde you had
no sinne, but nowe you say you see, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
your sinne remayneth. <hi>Ioh. 9.</hi> Thus
doubtlesse they are so farre from the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
&amp; subiection to poore Christ, that
contrariwise they doo willingly and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
followe their Father Lucifer, who
did lift him selfe arrogantly aboue Christ
the sonne of righteousnesse, and euermore
<pb facs="tcp:13555:129"/>
fyghteth against Christ, though the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
power and high wisedome of God tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
his euyll wyll and all theyrs to his
glory &amp; good purposes. None other wayes
than bodily and naturall darknesse, which
by the wonderfull wisdome of God, clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
setteth forth the bright Sunshyne, and
yet laboureth by continuall course to sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe
the Sunne, and to couer the whole
earth. Wherefore the Lord God to driu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

away this naturall darknesse from man,
exhorteth to iustice and equitie, which is
his nature, and the Image which man
ought to counterfayte. And alwayes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth
thinges therevnto agréeable.
And forbyddeth that hee is not, that is to

by his Prophetes and Preachers, publy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
his wyll and pleasure, which is the
lyght and lawe most perfecte to man his
noble creature, whome he hath made for
his honour and glory, whome he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to beare his Image vpon earth, of
iustice, righteousnesse &amp; innocency. But
because this Image could by no creature
perfectlye bée expressed, vnlesse the same
<pb facs="tcp:13555:129"/>
were fully replenished with the self same
Godhead, because that all things besides<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foorth
had some imperfection, bewraying
theyr originall the darknesse, as <hi>Iohn</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
it, the <hi>Tohu</hi> and <hi>Bohu,</hi> as <hi>Moyses</hi>
doeth it name. The vaine vanitie, and
wylde deformitie, whence they were by
creation altered, recouered, and brought
into lyght and lyfe, as appeared in <hi>Adam</hi>
fallyng from trueth to lyes, straight at the
begynning: nowe of necessitie the sonne
of God (who onely is good of nature) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth
man, and taketh this office to
beare the Image of God inuisible. <hi>Colo. 1.</hi>
And to be the head of that spyrituall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
which was to be wrought in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde,
by his aforeappointed purpose, and
becommeth the fyrst begotten of all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
for by him were all thinges created
both in heauen and earth, visible and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisible,
maiestie, Lordshyp, rule, &amp; power,
by whome, and in whome all things are
created, and hée is before all creatures,
and in him all thinges haue their beeing.
And he is the head of the bodie, he is the
begynning and first begotten of the head,
<pb facs="tcp:13555:130"/>
that in all things he might haue prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.
For it pleased the father that in him
should dwell al fulnesse, and by him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concyle
all thinges to himselfe. And to set
at peace by him through the blood of his
crosse, both things in heauen and things in
earth: for euen you, sayth <hi>Paule,</hi> which
in tymes paste were straungers, because
your minds were set in euyl works, hath
he now reconcyled in the body of his flesh
through death, to make you holye and
blamelesse, and without fault in his sight.
Seeing then that this cannot be denied to
be the course of God his holy working, to
dryue away this darknesse, and to bring
man to his lyght, to take away sinne, &amp; to
bring man to a lyfe blamelesse, the state

it not bee most necessarye to haue Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
&amp; Teachers, to tell vs the same, and
to admonishe vs wherevnto we be called,
seeing of our selues and our owne reasons
no such thing can be perceyued? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
haue we preachings &amp; exhortations,
as <hi>Paule</hi> sayth: for when the worlde tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe

<pb facs="tcp:13555:130"/>
of God, it pleased God through the
foolyshnesse of Preaching, to saue them
that beleeued. <hi>1. Corin. 1.</hi> And as hee also
sayth of him selfe in another place: Wée
doo Preach this ryches in Christ the hope
of your glory, warning all men, and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
all men in all wisedome, to make all

            <p>Thus serueth then exhortations, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations,
comminations, and publyca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the lawes and wyll of our Lorde
God: that hee maye bee knowne the Lord
and gouernour ouer all the thynges hée
hath created, and the onely lawe maker
amongst his creatures, publyshing vnto
all that perfecte equitie and iustice, which
ought in no case to be resysted. Whervn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
if they can not attayne, they must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
and knowledge their owne infirmity
and weakenesse, and submyt them selnes
vnder the mightie hande of God, and so
dooing they shall be receyued as chyldren
of the most louing and most mercyfull fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
in suche degrées of perfection as hee
hath appoynted to the beautifying of the
bodie of his sonne our head. So that the
<pb facs="tcp:13555:131"/>
Lorde God doeth teache all, and lyghten
all men that come into the worlde, bothe
chosen and Reprobate, with such a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
as doth the good Prince, which vnto
all his Subiects proclaimeth his statutes,
and publysheth his lawes: but lyke a good
and tender father, he leadeth his children,
regenerate and borne a newe, neyther of
fleshe nor blood, nor the wyll of man, and
guydeth them with his fatherly spyrite,
in the pathes of the same lawes, wryting
in theyr hartes what is his good wyll and
pleasure.</p>
            <p>In the which course of God his wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
worke, the wicked hath no cause to
complayne, for as theyr father whom they
doo followe, is named the Prince of this
world, so they haue the world at wyll, and
are riche roysters and welthy worldlings,
tramplyng vnder theyr feete, poore <hi>Abel,</hi>
and the despysed Christians: neyther wyl
they change their estate with any such, no
when they are called from darknesse to be
partakers of light, of life, and the heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
daynties, layde vp in poore Christ, they
despised that estate, excusing their purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
<pb facs="tcp:13555:131"/>
theyr marchaundice, and their earthly
lustes and delyghtes. <hi>Luke. 14.</hi> Wherfore

            <p>Such is the order then of God his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,

nowe appeareth the contrarie, that
it is very foolishnesse, euen darknesse com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
vnto lyght, death vnto lyfe, lyes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

accoumpted themselues wyse, they were
made very fooles, and chaunged the trueth
with lyes: the glory of the immortal God,
to mortall &amp; corruptyble creatures. They
following their owne righteousnesse could
not come to the ryghteousnesse of God in
Iesu Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:13555:132"/>Wherefore of necessitye God dyd shut
all vnder synne, that his mercie myght

and darknesse, death and lyfe, shame and

trueth, ryghteousnesse and vnryghteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
to serue to the settying foorth of his

with <hi>Paule:</hi> O the depth of the ryches of

            <p>And as this holy Apostle <hi>Paule</hi> doeth

<pb facs="tcp:13555:132"/>
Fathers from the begynning hath layde
this the onely foundation of theyr fayth:
Wherefore <hi>Moyses</hi> beginneth to stablish
the fayth of man at the historie of the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
and so foorth by the order of God
his present gouernaunce about the things
made and created. And <hi>Dauid</hi> for a
confession of his fayth, pronounceth of
this prouidence. <hi>Psalm. 95.</hi> I doo knowe
that thou art a great Lord, and a Lord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
all Gods. All thinges whatsoeuer
the Lordes pleasure was, hée hath made
in the Heauens, the earth, the Seas, and
the bottomlesse waters. Againe, by the
worde of God all things were set in their
places, and by the spyrite of his mouth all
the powers that be in them. And <hi>Paule</hi>

Wée knowe that all thinges worke for
the best vnto them that loue God, who
also are called of purpose: for those which
he knewe before, he also predestinate, that

            <p>So that thys appeareth to be no newe

of fayth and certainty of conscience in al
conflictes agaynst the worlde, the fleshe
and the deuil, agaynst Sinne, Death, and
Hell, as the Apostle vseth it in the latter
end of the same chapter, and all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

how coulde <hi>Adam</hi> by any other worke or
creature, eyther by comfort of any other

the Lorde God promised to prouyde for

of sinne and grace, of lighte and darknes,
they are compelled to crye and call, to sigh
and sobbe before theyr heauenly Father
for the deliueraunce of this mortall and
sinful booy subdued to vanitie: and though
they do most euidently perceyue how they
are called from darknesse to lighte, from
loue of iniquitie, to the hatred of the same,
from obedience somtime giuen to Sathan
and to the lustes of the flesh, to the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of the spirit, whiche fighteth against
the flesh, and though, I say, they percey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
this, be not able to quench these ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
lustes yet do they mourne and dayly
lament, calling for the grace of their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly

and sorowyngs of theyr sinnes, bée
the sensible féelings and liuely signes and

This doth <hi>Iames</hi> byd vs, to shewe our

did thus vtter his faith by his works,
and <hi>Rahab</hi> by her workes, and were iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed.

Godlye motions, and so brynging forth
<pb facs="tcp:13555:137"/>
good fruites of fayth and good workes, doo
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme our Election and vocation, as <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
speaketh, to our selues and others.</p>
            <p>The seconde vse of workes is, that God
in vs by them may be gloryfied. Whereof
our sauiour Christ sayth, <hi>Mat. 5.</hi> Let your
lyght so shine before men, that they séeing
your good works, may glorifie your father
which is in heauen. And this is the chiefe
vse of good workes, the laude and glorye
of God, where vnto wée were fyrst crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the earthy <hi>Adam,</hi> &amp; now are a new
restored by the heauenly <hi>Adam,</hi> Christ
Iesu, to walke in good works, &amp; to be holy,
blamelesse and without fault. And to this
ende, that God in them might bee glory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
doth scripture commend vnto vs good
works, &amp; setteth forth the crowne of glory
to them that therin are exercised. So ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne
that ye may obtaine, sayth the Apostle, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor
for the crowne incorruptible. <hi>1. Cor. 9.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nowe because these latter dayes are
the tymes wherein our Sauiour Christ
dyd saye, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ayth should fayle, and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rytie
shoulde ware colde, we that haue so
cleare reuelation of Gods great mercyes
<pb facs="tcp:13555:137"/>
wishing alwaies to be of more perfection,
let them with all thankes geeuinge vnto
God reioyce, knowing that this procedeth
not from flesh nor bloud, but fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the spirite
of our head Iesus Christ, who maketh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession
for his afflicted members (who
are his Sainctes) with vnspeakeable gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings.
Whome though for a time hee doo
permit to be afflicted, both in spirite and
bodie, as sometimes he did <hi>Iob, Ionas,
Ieremie,</hi> and other: yet at the ende hee
giueth vnto them most triumphant victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
accordinge to the euerlasting purpose
of his diuine prouidence, who is to be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
reuerenced, renowmed and praysed
for euer. So be it.</p>
            <p>Heretofore haue we answered gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
to them that woulde make God the
Author of euyll, and to them which do say,
that this doctrine taketh away exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and threatninges, and the preachyng
of the worde. Nowe by the grace of God,
we wyl more briefly answere to some ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
whiche they bryng foorthe of the
scriptures, setting aparte all such cauyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
as mans reason (whiche in Gods
<pb facs="tcp:13555:138"/>
mysteries can neuer bée satisfyed) by the
craft of the deuyl doth excogitate, &amp; inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.
But first we wyl speake somthing of good
workes, &amp; the true vnderstanding of those
scriptures which commend them vnto vs,
lest we should seeme to dissuade men from
the same, or exte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ate the meaning of the
holy ghost in such sentences as our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
doo wickedly peruert for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of mans power against this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
of grace &amp; free Election, which dare
affirme that by works they purchase part
of theyr saluation, the which (as we haue
sayde) is freely geuen by this Election in
Christ Iesu before the foundation of the
world was lay<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>The good works which are so in déede,
that is to say, which proceede of the spirite
of adoption, &amp; the feeling of Gods mercies
in electing, calling &amp; iustifying, fyrst of all
haue this vse, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> they declare the power of
God to bee in vs, and the spyrite of Christ,
which doth conforme vs to his image: and
this is the ende whervnto we are Elected
and Predestinate to be conformed to the
Image of his sonne. <hi>Rom. 8.</hi> Elected before
<pb facs="tcp:13555:138"/>
the foundation of the world, to be holy and
blamelesse. <hi>Eph. 1.</hi> Created vnto good wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes,
which God hath prepared for vs to
walke therein. <hi>Eph. 2.</hi> These haue the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
as <hi>Paul</hi> sayth, not onely of this lyfe,
but of the world to come. Therefore sayth
our Sauiour Christ. <hi>Math. 25.</hi> Come ye
blessed of my father, possesse the kingdome
prepared for you from the begynning of
the world. I was hungry, and ye gaue me
meate: I was thyrstie, and ye gaue me
drinke. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Of this excellent commendation and
rewarde of good workes, we do learne the
dignity of the same, not of the worthinesse
of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, which are neuer able to stand
in Gods iudgementes: for our very righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesses
are, as <hi>Esay</hi> sayth, as clothes
fylthily polluted, but of the dignitie of the
grace of the promise of God, who worketh
them in vs. For it is God, sayth <hi>Paul,</hi> that
worketh in vs both the wyll and also the
worke, euen of his purpose. <hi>Phi. 2.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all is of grace, not of works, least any
should glory. <hi>Ephes. 2.</hi> For if there were
any power in our selues, or dignity in the
<pb facs="tcp:13555:139"/>
workes, then had we some thing to glory,
but now that all is confessed to be of Gods
free mercies, and nothing of our selues, we
conclude that God crowneth and rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
his owne workes in vs, that who so
gloryeth should glory in the Lord. <hi>1. Cor. 1.</hi>

               </gap>edge this place. <hi>Ma. 26</hi>
so to commende workes that they shoulde
bee the cause of the Election and the fauor
of God, they doo not consyder the fyrst
wordes: Come you blessed of my Father,
inheryte the kingdome prepared for you
from the beginning of the world. Wherin
we may note, that they beeing the blessed
and beloued of the father, are called to the
inheritance of the heauenly kingdom, not
wonne by works, but prepared by the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
Father for his children, before they
dyd any works at all: Lyke as the wicked
haue theyr place of eternal torment, there
named for them before, prepared and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted.
And in both twayne the workes
both only declare what the trées are where
out they spring, and testifie what the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
is whence they flowe: according as<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
our sauiour Christ saith: the trée is known
<pb facs="tcp:13555:139"/>
in Iesus Christ maye geue no occasion to
the slouthfull fleshe, eyther in our selues
or others: but after the example of the
Scriptures, we must alwayes exhort to
good workes, and so tame our bodyes and
bring them into subiection (as <hi>Paul</hi> sayth)
least whyles we preach to others, we our
selues be founde Reprobates. <hi>1. Corin. 9.</hi>
The which sentence is euil aledged of the
aduersaries of Election, as though <hi>Paule</hi>
myght haue become a Reprobate, or as if
that he had not bene certaine of his salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but that it shoulde hang of his well
dooings. For he saith first in the same sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
I do so ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne, not as at an vncertain
thing, and so fyght, not as one that beateth

chap. 8. I am sure that neyther death nor
lyfe, neyther Angels, nor rule, neyther
power, neyther thinges present, neyther
things to come, neither high, neither low,
neither any other creature, shalbe able to
depart vs from the loue of God in Christ
Iesu our Lorde. Lykewise they alledge
foorth of the seconde Chapter to the <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians,</hi>
that <hi>Paule</hi> wylleth vs to work<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <pb facs="tcp:13555:140"/>
our owne saluation: but they doo not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
that he streight wayes addeth, that
it is God whiche worketh bothe the wyll
and the worke. And in the chapter before,
he saith, that it is God which hath begon y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
good work, and wyll finish it. So that such
Scriptures maye neuer bee alledged for
workes agaynste grace, for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

saluation of our selues, which onely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
of mercy in the free Election, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we were chosen in Christe Iesu, and
created a newe in him, by his onely spirite
to bring foorth good workes. Therefore
doo we conclude with <hi>Paule. Romaines. 11.</hi>
that wée are saued and iustified freelye
by grace, not by workes, for so grace
were no grace, and that all are shutte vp
vnder synne, that mercye may be vppon
all, vppon whome it pleasethe hym to
shewe mercye. And for the considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
