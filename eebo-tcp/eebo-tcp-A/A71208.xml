            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <q>
                        <p>12 He said therefore, A certaine noble man went into a
far countrey, to receive for himselfe a Kingdome, and
to returne.</p>
                        <p>13 And he called his ten servants, and delivered them
ten pounds, and said unto them, Traffick till I come.</p>
                        <p>14 But his citizens hated him, and sent a message after
him, saying, we will not have this man to raign over us.</p>
                        <p>15 And it came to passe, that when he was returned, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
received the Kingdome, then he commanded these
servants to be called unto him, to whom he had given
the money, that hee might know how much every man
had gained by trading.</p>
                        <p>16 Then came the first, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
ten pounds.</p>
                        <p>17 And he said unto him, Well, thou good servant; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
thou hast been faithfull in a very little, have thou
authority over ten cities.</p>
                        <p>18 And the second came, saying, Lord, thy pound hath
gained five ponds.</p>
                        <p>19 And hee said likewise to him, Be thou also over five
cities.</p>
                        <p>20 And another came, saying, Lord, Behold here is thy
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55569:3"/>
pound which I have kept laid up in a napkin:</p>
                        <p>21 For I feared thee, because thou art an austere man:
thou takest up that thou layedst not down, and reapest
that thou didst not sow.</p>
                        <p>22 And he saith unto him, Out of thine own mouth will
I judge thee, thou wicked servant: Thou knewest that I
was an austere man, taking up that I laid not down, and
reaping that I did not sow:</p>
                        <p>23 Wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the
banke, that at my comming I might have required mine
own with usury?</p>
                        <p>24 And he said unto them that stood by, Take from him
the pound, and give it to him that hath ten pounds.</p>
                        <p>25 And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.</p>
                        <p>26 For I said unto you, That unto every one which hath,
shall be given, and from him that hath not, even that he
hath shall be taken away from him.</p>
                        <p>27 But those mine enemies which would not that I
should raign over them, bring hither and slay
them before me.</p>

Servants, or Great Officers, that deny to
assist their Master against the Rebellion of the
Citizens, but out of avarice, hide their money
gotten in his service, these like the wicked and
slothfull servants, lose their places and goods,
which are given to more deserving men; If a
King have but one of these evill Ministers, it
were sufferable; but when many of these shall
appeare and complayne, that the King is a hard
master, an oppressour, and exact our, to reape
where he had not sowen, and to take more then
his due; what King can beare it? If they durst

such temporizing servants know, that the King
in his returne, after he hath recovered and setled
his Kingdome, will judge them out of their
owne mouth; for if he were a hard master in the
beginning of the Rebellion, much more will he
be to them of his owne house, when he hath cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stised

the Apostle, 2 <hi>Tim. 4. 3. that men will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:55569:16"/>
and the Epistle to the Romans, and wee
shall find what sound doctrine is. First, the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of prayer for Kings, 1 <hi>Tim. 2. 1. I exhort first
of all that prayers be made for Kings,</hi> but certaine
Brownists of these times will not pray for the
King, but revile him in their prayers. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the doctrine against<note n="a" place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 12.</note> Women Preachers, I
suffer not a Woman to teach, nor to usurpe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
but saith <hi>Isay,</hi>

                     <hi>Women rule over you.</hi>
Thirdly, the doctrine of obedience to<note n="c" place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 1.</note> superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours;
but now Servants run away from their
Masters without their consent, and rise up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them in the publick cause; doe these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
sound doctrine?<note place="margin">Rom 1.</note> Fourthly, the doctrine of
justification by faith, which Pelagians of old,
and the Papists now deny. Fifthly, sanctification,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 1. which Gnostikes and Nicolaitans for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly,
now Familists and Antinomians deny.
Sixthly, the doctrine of predestination without
foresight, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 1. which Papists and Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians
oppose. Seventhly, the doctrine of subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to Kings, though they be Heathens and
Tyrants, which<note n="d" place="margin">Epiphan.</note> Gnostikes of old, and now Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists
and Brownists oppose, they can live
without a King, though Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Rom.
13. 1. Let every soule be subject,</hi> but these men
thinke they have no soules, because they would
have no King in <hi>Israel, that they may do that which
is right in their owne eyes, Iudges 21. ult.</hi> The
Christians of <hi>Rome</hi> paid tribute and custome to
<hi>Nero</hi> and <hi>Trajan</hi> Tyrants, but these rob the King
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:55569:16"/>
of his due, and yet they say <hi>pro Rege;</hi> they say
Kings of old were anoynted, therefore the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
was subject as to Gods ordinance, but now it
is not so: To which I answer<note n="e" place="margin">R. David. Kimchi.</note> with the Jew, no
King the sonne of a King was anoynted, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
in case of division about the right, as <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
when <hi>Adoniah</hi> would be King, but the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
came by succession, as every mans inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance

The Kings of <hi>Jury</hi> made no such covenant as our
Kings do; I answer with the same Jew, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
