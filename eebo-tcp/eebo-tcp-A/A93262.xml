            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

WITH
A true Relation of a ſtrange Monſter born in Ratcliffe
High-way: Alſo a Cat kitning a monſter in
Lombard ſtreet, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a knowne thing to all Chriſtian people
which are capable of underſtanding how that
the ſinnes of the world have in a high degree
offended the worlds Maker, and provoked
the Lord to anger, yet hath the Divel ſo blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the eyes, and hardned the hearts of many
men and women, that they cannot or will not ſee nor take
notice of their owne iniquities, but rather ſeeme to excuſe
themſelves of thoſe errors which they every day runne into.
One will ſay, What though the Lord hath laid his puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hand upon the Kingdome, is it my fault? I am no ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,
nor drunkard, no covetous perſon, no prophaner of the
Lords Sabbath: and yet peradventure he that thus juſtifies him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
is guilty of all theſe, and more then are here named.</p>
            <p>Another will be apt to ſay thus: If it be ſinne that hath
brought the ſword, or the plague, or any other judgement
upon us, 'tis not for any ſins of mine, tis long of ſuch a Lord,
or long of ſuch a Magiſtrate that the Lord hath puniſhed the
Land.</p>
            <p>Others have ſaid, Tis long of the King that the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is ſo grievouſly troubled, for, ſay they, if the King had
ſlaid with his Parliament, we had beene all at peace and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et.
And thus doe many people fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tter themſelves, and lay the
blame on others. But of this I am certainly perſwaded that it
is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ot only for one mans ſins, but it is for every ones ſins that
the Lord hath cauſed the ſword to be drawn amongſt us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:113126:3"/>
Furthermore I obſerve that the Lord had decreed a ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
betweene the King and his Parliament before the wars be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
in England for the fins of the whole nation. That the
Lord is angry with us every one; for our ſins doe appeare
in this: Doe we not ſee that the bloody wars doth more and
more increaſe in our three Kingdoms<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereby every mans
heart een trimbles to thinke what ſhall become of them.</p>
            <p>Doe we not know that the plague of Peſtilence doth daily
annoy our Cities, Townes, and Countries: and what great
numbers have dyed in <hi>Bristoll, Abington,</hi> and many places
more.</p>
            <p>Doe we not heare continuall claymour ring in our ears?
how that famine will follow after the ſword, except the Lord
will in mercy ſtay the rage of our enemies: It is ſaid, that
Peſtilence, the Sword and Famine, are the ſearchers, wherwith
the Lord drawes blood of ſinners: is there then any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
man or woman amongſt us all, but either at one time
or other hath felt the ſmart of one, if not all of thoſe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named
ſcourges<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> no, no, there is none alive but hath ſmarted
in one degree or other; even from the King to the Begger,
<hi>Ergo,</hi> we are all ſinners: to make it further appeare<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the
Lord is angry with us for our ſins. Have there not beene
ſtrange Comets ſeen in the ayre, prodigies, fights on the ſeas,
marvellous tempeſts and ſtormes on the land: all theſe are
eminent tokens of Gods anger to Sinners yet thats one all:
Have not nature altered her courſe ſo much, that women fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of pure fleſh and blood, bringeth forth ugly and defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Monſters; and contrariwiſe Beaſts bring forth humane
ſhapes contrary to their kind.</p>
            <p>Have not the Lord ſuffered the Devill to ramble about like
a roring Lyon ſeeing to devoure us: have not a crew of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
Witches, together with the Devils asſiſtance done many
miſchiefes, in <hi>Norfolke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Suffolke, Eſſex,</hi> and other parts of
our Kingdome, whereof ſome were executed at <hi>Chenſford</hi> in
Eſſex laſt to the number of fourteen, and many more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned
to this day, and by the voice of people there are
ſome in <hi>Stepney</hi> Pariſh now in queſtion about witchcraft,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:113126:3"/>
being perſons of eminence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their names muſt as yet be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed,
but time will bring truth to light: one thing more of
the Witches which have not beene yet printed, was thus: on
wedneſday laſt, <hi>Iuly,</hi> 30. being Faſt-day at a Towne called
<hi>Soffam</hi> in Norfolke, at the Houſe of <hi>Peter-Smith,</hi> about 4,
a clock in the after-noone came a woman ſeeming to be ſome
great gentle woman or Lady on Horſe-back who knocking
at the dore deſired to come in, there being in the houſe no
body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but one ſervant Maid, who told her, that he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Maſter
and Dam with the reſt of the Houſhold were at the Church,
and that ſhe durſt let in no body, till ſuch time the Sermon
was done, whereat the Gentlewoman commanded her to
fetch her ſome of the beſt Beer in the Houſe: the Maid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed,
that there was but one ſort of Beer in the Houſe, and
that ſhee would not meddle with till her Maſter came from
Church, the Gentlewoman bad her to give her ſome of the
Bacon, that was boyling in the pot, whereat the Maid began
to tremble, and withal marvelled much how ſhe ſhould come
to know what meat was in the pot, and therwithall lift up her
hands crying, <hi>The Lord deliver me from all witches:</hi> ſaid the
Gentlewoman, ſee thou look well to thy Beer, &amp; thy Swines
fleſh preſently ſeem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d to mount her Horſe over the top of the
Barne and ſo vaniſhed: When the mau and his ſervants were
come from the Church, they found the Maid trembling and
quaking in a mighty ſweat, being not able to ſpeake to them
for the ſpace of two hours, but having recovered her ſtrength
&amp; ſpeech, ſhe told them how the Gentlewoman had talkt with
her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; what anſwer ſhe made, &amp; of her ſudden departure, and
of her going into the Sellar for Beer the Casks were broken,
and all the Beere about the Roome: Then the Maid remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred,
how that the woman bad her have a care of her Beer,
and Swines fleſh went ſtreight-way into the Barten, where
ſhe found three of her Maſters fat Hogs, crying, and laying
out their tongues, and ſo they dyed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:113126:4"/>
               <hi>Iuly</hi> 30. <hi>Soffam,</hi> a knowne witch in <hi>Suffolke,</hi> not above 2,
miles from <hi>Clare,</hi> met with a woman great with childe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
from the Bake-houſe with a Cake under her arme, ſaid
the witch, Give me thy Cake: the woman broke it in the
middle, and offered her one part, which the witch refuſed, and
ſaid, As ſhe had broken the Cake, ſo ſhould the childe be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in her body. And immediately the woman went home,
and was delivered of two lumps of fleſh.</p>
            <p>It is likewiſe certified by many of good quality and worth
that at the laſt Aſſiſes in <hi>Norfolke</hi> there were 40 witches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned
for their lives, and 20. executed: and that they have
done very much harme in that Countrey, and have propheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of the downfall of the King and his Army, and that Prince
<hi>Robert</hi> ſhall be no longer ſhot-free: with many ſtrange and
unheard of things that ſhall come to paſſe.</p>
            <p>Theſe and many more ſuch like evils have of late beene
done in the Countrey, as is affirmed by good ſufficient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
as ſhall be related hereafter. And now will I returne
and tell you of ſome ſtrange newes neerer home.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iuly</hi> 28. at a place called <hi>Ratcliffe High-way</hi> neere
unto <hi>London,</hi> at the ſigne of the three Arrows, dwelt a
woman named Miſtris <hi>Hart,</hi> who lived and was well
beloved of her neighbours, ſhe was religiouſly given,
honeſt in behaviour, courteous in her ſpeech, and well
qualified in her actions: This woman being with
childe, would oftentimes ſay that ſhe was mightily
troubled with what ſhe bore in her wombe, as well ſhe
might be: for on the 28. day of <hi>Iuly</hi> laſt, about 6. of
the clocke in the morning ſhe fell ſtrongly in labour,
and therewithall ſent for the Midwife, whoſe name is
Miſtris <hi>Bullock,</hi> and other of her neighbours to come to
her labour, who through Gods aſſiſtance brought her
to a ſafe delivery. The Infant being brought into the
world, the Midwife and the reſt of the women having
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:113126:4"/>
taken a view of it, perceived it to be the ſtrangeſt miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhapen
Monſter that ever they lookt on, or heard tell
of. It was both hee and ſhee, borne without a noſe,
without hands and feet or legs, one eare, and that grew
in the neck, and where the legs and armes ſhould have
beene, there grew pieces of fleſh, and no bones nor
ioynts. This deformed Monſter was borne alive, but
it lived not long: the woman is yet living.</p>
            <p>Thus doth the Lord daily ſend wonders into the
world, thereby to put us in minde of our ſinnes, and
move us to repentance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>One ſtrange Relation more I have to mention, and ſo
conclude: and that is this:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>Lombardſtreet</hi> in <hi>London</hi> in a Goldſmiths houſe,
a Cat brought forth a monſtrous Kitnen, which was
partly ſhapen like a humane creature, and the other
part Monſter like. The manner of the forme was
thus: It had eight feet upon one body, and two tayls,
his pawes were like a childes hands, and never a head,
but one great eye placed in the body where the head
ſhould be.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus have I related unto you ſuch news which is known
to be as true as ſtrange: God in his mercy give us all a
ſight of our ſins, and grant us grace to acknowledge them,
and amend our lives.</hi>
